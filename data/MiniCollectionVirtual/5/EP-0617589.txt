 CORE BIOPSY NEEDLE UNITS FOR USE WITHAUTOMATED BIOPSY GUNSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1) Field of the InventionThis invention relates to improvements in needle units used with automated biopsy guns of the type which can be adjusted to allow precise amounts of sample tissue to be collected during a biopsy procedure. 2) Prior ArtThe removal of minute tissue samples from humans and animals by introducing a needle into the body and catching the sample within the needle, is a frequently used medical practice today. Such samples are necessary for microscopic examination, organ cultures, etc.The method most commonly followed for obtaining tissue samples has been to use a needle which is formed of an inner solid rod which has a sampling notch in the distal end thereof, in conjunction with a hollow outer cannula which slides thereover and cuts tissue which has been located in the sampling notch of the inner rod. The inner rod, except for its pointed distal end, is located within the cannula when the device is inserted into the tissue to be sampled. The outer cannula is then held stationary while the inner rod is inserted deeper into the tissue. While in this position, tissue moves into the sampling notch of the inner rod just adjacent the pointed distal tip thereof. The inner rod is then held stationary while the outer cannula is slid thereover. Motion of the outer cannula passing over the sampling notch causes the tissue located therein to be severed from surrounding tissue and thereafter to be trapped in the sampling notch as the cannula completely covers the inner needle distal end. Both the outer cannula and the inner rod with the tissue sample secured therein are then simultaneously removed from the patient. The outer cannula is then slid back away from the distal end of the inner rod to allow removal of the tissue sample from the 

 sampling notch thereof. The tissue sample is then examined.This general method of tissue sampling has been used for several decades and is exemplified in U. S. Patent No. 3,477,423. As disclosed therein, the needle movements are made manually. This has certain disadvantages, in that movements may not be made fast enough to insure clean and complete severance of a tissue sample. Further, manual operation of the needle generally involves inaccurate movements, and slight lack of coordination between the needle and the cannula. This often causes unnecessary tissue damage and, in the case of infectious or tumorous tissue, can possibly cause spreading of the diseased tissue

 said hub in essentially parallel orientation to the elongate needle extending from said hub; means for interlocking the second end of said arm to said second hub to hold said second hub at a fixed distance and at a fixed orientation with respect to said first hub; and means associated with said second hub for releasing the interlocking engagement when the second hub is received in a receiver cavity of an automated biopsy gun. 4. Improved core biopsy needle units in accordance with Claim 3 wherein the means for interlocking the second end of said arm to said second hub comprises an opening through said second hub through which said arm is received for longitudinal sliding motion through said opening; at least one notch on the perimeter of said arm adjacent to the second end of said arm; a generally inverted, U-shaped slideway formed in said second hub, said slideway comprising a pair of elongate slots formed in the opposite sides of said second hub and a third slot formed at the top of said second hub interconnecting the pair of slots on the sides of said second hub; a generally U-shaped slide member that slides in said slideway, said slide member comprising a pair of legs spaced from each other by a base member attached to respective ends of said legs, with the legs of said slide member received in sliding engagement in the pair of elongate slots in said second hub and with the base member of said slide member received in sliding engagement in the third slot formed at the top of said second hub; and an interlock tab on the base member of said U-shaped slide member that engages and interlocks with said notch on the perimeter of said arm when said notch is aligned with said third slot of said slideway and when said U- 


 shaped slide member is slid so that the interlock tab slides into engagement with said notch. 5. Improved core biopsy needle units in accordance with Claim 4 wherein the means associated with said second hub for releasing the interlocking engagement of the second end of said arm to said second hub comprises at least one foot member extending downwardly from one of said legs such that when said U-shaped slide member is slid so that the interlock tab slides into engagement with said notch, the foot member extends from a lower side of said second hub, whereby when said second hub is received in a respective receiver cavity of an automated biopsy gun, the foot member extending from the lower side of the second hub is pushed upwardly thereby pushing the U-shaped slide member upwardly so that the interlock tab slides out of engagement with the notch in said arm and the arm can then slide freely in the opening of said second hub. 6. Improved core biopsy needle units in accordance with Claim 1 wherein said interlocking type engagement means formed in the exposed end of the hub that faces away from the second end of said needle comprises a teno . 7. Improved core biopsy needle units in accordance with Claim 6 wherein there is further provided an elongate, straight arm whose first end is integrally attached to said hub and whose second end extends away from said hub so that the arm projects from said hub in essentially parallel orientation to the elongate needle extending from said hub; means for interlocking the second end of said arm to said second hub to hold said second hub at a fixed distance and at a fixed orientation with respect to said first hub; and means associated with said second hub for releasing the interlocking engagement when the second hub is
