<ABSTRACT>
A commode comprises a hollow main body (12) 
moulded from a plastics material and defining a seating 

portion (16) on its top with a recess (14) in the 
seating portion (16) adapted to receive a chamber pot. 

The body (12) is of sufficient strength to support the users 
body weight and includes means (26,34) by which the body 

(12) can be supported on legs (30,32) to form an article 
of furniture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articles of furniture 
and parts and fittings thereof and especially but not 
exclusively to commodes. Commodes are articles of furniture intended to 
support and often conceal a chamber pot. It is often 
intended that they closely resemble normal articles of 
furniture and consequently the basis of their 
manufacture resembles that employed for normal articles 
of furniture, for example, they have wooden frames and 
upholstered portions. Wooden frames are often 
disadvantageous in such applications as they can give 
rise to hygiene problems. If, for example, urine is 
absorbed into the wood. Additionally, it is often 
difficult to conceal the fact that the article of 
furniture used as a commode. A further disadvantage is that as a result of the 
compromise in design between a functional commode and an 
article of furniture a hygienic and efficient commode 
cannot readily be achieved as a result of design 
compromises leading to a more aesthetic appearance. 
Additional difficulties have been encountered when it is 
desired to give the commode, for example in the form of 
a chair, an upholstered finish.  It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome or mitigate these and other disadvantages. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a commode comprising a main body 
formed as a hollow member from a mouldable material, the 
body defining a recess adapted to receive a chamber pot, 
being of sufficient strength to support a user's weight, 
defining a seating portion around said recess and 
including means for engaging support means on which the 
body is supported. The main body may be hollow formed by moulding, 
preferably by rotational moulding. The body is 
preferably formed of a suitable plastics material. Preferably the seating portion slopes downwardly 
towards said recess and defines a first surface in the 
form of a lip extending around the outer edge of the 
main body and a second sloping surface extends to the 
recess at least part way around the recess, the first 
surface extending directly to the recess at the front of 
the recess and a third sloping surface extending between 
the second sloping surface and the first surface at the 
rear region of the seating portion.  Preferably a fourth sloping surface extends 
between the first and second suraces at front regions of 
the seating portion on opposite sides of the recess and 
is less steep than the second sloping surface. Preferably, the fourth sloping surface is provided 
at front

A commode characterised in that it comprises a 
main body (12) formed as a hollow member from a 

mouldable material, the body (12) defining a recess (14) 
adapted to receive a chamber pot, being of sufficient 

strength to support a user's weight, defining a seating 
portion (16) around said recess (14) and including means 

(26,34) for engaging support means (30,32) on which the 
body (12) is supported. 
A commode as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the main body (12) is formed by rotational moulding 

from a suitable plastics material. 
A commode as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the seating portion (16) slopes 

downwardly towards said recess and defines a first 
surface in the form of a lip (20) extending around the 

outer edge of the main body and a second sloping surface 
(22) extending to the recess (14) at least part way 

around the recess, the first surface (20) extending 
directly to the recess (14) at the front of the recess 

and a third sloping surface (23) extending between the 
second sloping surface (22) and the first surace (20) at 

the rear region of the seating portion (16). 
A commode as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in 
that a fourth sloping surface (24) extends between the 

first and second surfaces (20,22) at front regions of 
the seating portion (16) on opposite sides of the 

recess (14) and is less steep than the second sloping 
surface. 
A commode as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the means (26) for engaging 

support means (30) are provided in a side wall (18) 
extending at least part way around the seating portion 

(16) and depending downwardly therefrom and comprise 
threaded bosses moulded into the side wall (18) and 

adapted to receive bolts (28) by which legs (30) can be 
secured to the main body (12). 
A commode as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the side wall (18) is provided 

with rail engaging means adapted to engage a suitable 
rail (32) on a support structure (31) for supporting the 

main body (12) the rail engaging means being in the form 
of at least first and second overhanging members (34) 

adapted to engage first and second oppositely arranged 
rails (32) on the support structure. 
A commode as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that upholstery (44) is 

attached to the commode by staples (41) inserted 
directly into the main body (16). 
A method of manufacturing an article of furniture 
said method comprising assembling a plurality of 

components (10,30) some of which are formed from 
plastics material and attaching to some or all of the 

plastics material components suitable upholstery (44) by 
staples (41). 
A method as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in 
that the plastics material components (10) are formed by 

a rotational, injection, vacuum or blow moulding 
technique.
