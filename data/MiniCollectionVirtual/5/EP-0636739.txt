<ABSTRACT>
Diorganopolysiloxane compositions are 
provided with excellent heat resistance, especially 

diorganopolysiloxane compositions that are suitable for 
synthetic fiber lubricants. The diorganopolysiloxane 

composition is a mixture of (A) a diorganopolysiloxane 
oil and (B) an amino-group-containing diorganopolysiloxane, 

and has an average amino equivalent in the 
range of 10,000-1,000,000 and a viscosity at 25°C in 

the range of 10-100,000 mm 2/s (cs).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns 
diorganopolysiloxane compositions with excellent heat 
resistance, especially diorganopolysiloxane 
compositions suitable as oils for synthetic fibers. Natural fibers such as cotton, and wool have 
excellent smoothness, because of the wax or lanolin 
adhered on their surface. However, such smoothness is 
lacking in synthetic fibers such as nylon fibers, 
polyester fibers, polypropylene fibers, and TEFLON™. 
Thus, oils are used on raw synthetic fibers to provide 
smoothness and antistatic properties. The yarns 
prepared from such raw fibers are subjected to false 
twisting for various purposes such as bulk, and stretch 
recovery. At this time, the yarn is brought into 
contact with a hotplate at a temperature of at least 
300°C and such yarns are treated with false twisting 
oils to impart heat resistance to them. In the preparation of carbon fibers and 
graphite fibers from polyacrylonitrile synthetic 
fibers, the precursor obtained by spinning is heated at 
300-400°C to obtain flame-resistant fibers, and an oil 
is used to prevent the filaments from sticking 
together. Compared with raw fibers for apparel, the raw 
fibers for industrial tire cords are brought into 
contact with hot rolls for a long time and heat-set at 
300-350°C. Thus, such raw fibers are treated for 
enhanced heat resistance with lubricants for raw fibers 
for tire cords. Mineral oils, animal, and vegetable oils are 
used in such lubricants for raw fibers and false-twist 
yarns. Also, dimethylsilicone oil (JP-A 51-12739) and 
amino-containing silicone oils (JP-A 60-185879 and 60-185880)  
 
have been proposed as lubricants for raw fibers 
for carbon fibers. However, mineral and vegetable oils have low 
heat resistance, and they tend to decompose at low 
temperatures. This causes problems in accomplishing 
their functions under high temperature. The silicone 
oils described above also lack sufficient heat 
resistance. Thus, when exposed to high temperature for 
a long time, they become a tacky gel that accumulates. 
This condition results in reduced heat treatment 
efficiency and reduced fiber running with subsequent 
fiber disturbances and breakage. Accordingly, 
improvements are desired in synthetic fiber lubricants 
used for raw fibers, false-twist fibers, raw fibers for 
carbon fibers, and raw fibers for tire cords. We have discovered that these problems can be 
solved by mixing diorganopolysiloxanes oils and amino-group-containing 
diorganopolysiloxanes to obtain an 
average amino equivalent within
