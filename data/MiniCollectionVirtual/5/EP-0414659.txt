<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for detachable fixing of lining and/or covering plates on support elements, wherein the plate is secured against displacement on the support element and can be fixed against being lifted off by a bar which can be rotated parallel to the plane of the plates, wherein the bar (8) is constructed as a disc (9) which is rotatable on a support plate (15) and has on its periphery a recess (10), through which a retaining part (8), e.g. a strap, which projects away from the other part in each case approximately parallel to the plane of the disc, can be moved transversely to the plane of the disc, wherein, when the plate (6) is situated in contact with the support element (2), the spacing of the surface of the disc (9) facing the retaining part (2) from the part (2) bearing said disc is only slightly greater than the spacing of the surface of the retaining part (8) facing the disc (9) from said bearing part.

An arrangement for the detachable fixing of facing 
and/or cover plates onto support members, the plate (6) 

being secured against displacement to the support member 
(2) and being securable against removal by a latch (7) 

which is rotatable parallel to the plane of the plate, 
characterised in that the latch (7) is constructed as a 

disk (9) which is rotatable on a supporting plate (15) 
arranged on the support member (2) of the facing and/or 

cover plate (6), said disk having, on its circumference, 
a recess (10) through which a retaining part (8), for 

example a tongue, which projects from the facing and/or 
cover plate (6) or the support member (2) so as to be 

parallel to the plane of the disk, may be moved 
transversely to the plane of the disk, the spacing 

between the disk (9) face, confronting the retaining 
part (8), and the part carrying the disk, i.e. the 

supporting part (2) or the facing and/or cover plate 
(6), in the case of a facing and/or cover plate abutting 

the support member (2), being only slightly greater than 
the spacing between the face of the retaining part (8), 

confronting the disk (9), and said supporting part, i.e. 
the facing and/or cover plate (6) or the support member 

(2). 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that, parallel to the disk (9) provided with the 

recess (10), there is, in the insertion direction of the 
retaining part (8) behind the disk (9), additionally, a 

complete disk (11) on the latch (7), the spacing of 
which disk (11) from the disk provided with the recess 

is slightly greater than the thickness of the retaining 
part (8).  

 
An arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that both disks (9, 11) are integrally connected with 

one another while forming a circumferential groove (12), 
both disks (9, 11) being movable along a screw thread 

(13, 14) in the direction of the part (2) supporting 
them or away therefrom. 
An arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a catching device (23 - 26) for 

retaining the latch (7) in the open position or in the 
closed position engages on the latch (7).
