<ABSTRACT>
Unicondylar knee prosthesis, composed of a femoral implant and a tibial implant. The femoral implant (1) has an edge (12) on the perimeter of its face (11) which is in contact with the bone, as well as studs (13) inclined at 30@ in its distal part (10), its apex (14) being tapered and rounded and not exceeding beyond the trochleo-distal limit, and its posterior part (15) having a plane surface (16) corresponding to the bone cross-section; whereas the tibial part consists of a tibial base (2) on which a plastic pad (3) is fixed, the tibial base (2) consisting of a plate (20) of semicircular shape, extended, perpendicular to its plane, on its straight side, with an anchoring fin (21), the periphery of the face of the plate (20) in contact with the bone furthermore including an edge which is capable, like the edge (12) of the femoral implant (1), of being lined in order to improve its fastening.
