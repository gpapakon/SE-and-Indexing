<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this application various publications are
referenced by arabic numerals within parentheses. Full
citations for these publications may be found at the end
of the specification immediately preceding the claims.
The disclosures of these publications in their entireties
are hereby incorporated by reference into this
application in order to more fully describe the state of
the art to which this invention pertains.Cancer is a disorder in which a population of cells has
become, in varying degrees, unresponsive to the control
mechanisms which normally govern proliferation and
differentiation. For many years there have been two
principal strategies for chemotherapeutic treatment of
cancer: a) blocking hormone-dependent tumor cell
proliferation by interference with the production or
peripheral action of sex hormones; and b) killing cancer
cells directly by exposing them to cytotoxic substances,
which injure both neoplastic and normal cell populations.Relatively recently, cancer therapy is also being
attempted by the induction of terminal differentiation of
the neoplastic cells (1). In cell culture models
differentiation has been reported by exposure of cells to
a variety of stimuli, including: cyclic AMP and retinoic
acid (2,3), aclarubicin and other anthracyclines (4).There is abundant evidence that neoplastic transformation
does not necessarily destroy the potential of cancer
cells to differentiate (1,5,6). There are many examples
of tumor cells which do not respond to the normal 
regulators of proliferation and appear to be blocked in
the expression of their differentiation program, and yet
can be induced to differentiate and cease replicating.
A variety of agents, including some relatively simple
polar compounds (5,7-9), derivatives of vitamin D and
retinoic acid (10-12), steroid hormones (13), growth
factors (6,14), proteases (15,16), tumor promoters
(17,18), and inhibitors of DNA or RNA synthesis (4,19-24),
can induce various transformed cell lines and
primary human tumor explants to express more
differentiated characteristics.Early studies by the present inventors identified a
series of polar compounds that were effective inducers of
differentiation in a number of transformed cell lines
(8,9). Of these, the most effective induce, was the
hybrid polar/apolar compound N,N'-hexamethylene
bsacetamide (HMBA) (9). The use of this polar/apolar
compound to induce murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC) to
undergo erythroid differentiation with suppression of
oncogenicity has proved a useful model to study
