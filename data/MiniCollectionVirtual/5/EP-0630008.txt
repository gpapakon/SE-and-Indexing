substrate, an amorphous seed layer and a recording 

multilayer layer. The seed layer is ITO, SnOâ‚‚, Si or 
SiC, and the recording multilayer includes alternating 

layers of cobalt/platinum or cobalt/palladium or 
mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetooptical (MO)
recording media having a cobalt/platinum (Co/Pt) or
cobalt/palladium (Co/Pd) multilayered structure.Co/Pt multilayers have been used for MO
recording media. These materials have perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy, large Kerr rotation at short
wavelength and excellent environmental stability.
However, these materials when deposited by conventional
sputtering processes possess low coercivity. Attempts
have been made to increase the coercivity by
controlling the Co/Pt ratio, using seed layers of
metals and dielectrics, and etching the substrate
before depositing the multilayer (see Magnetooptic
Recording Medium, European Patent Appln. 0304873
(1988)); Perpendicular Magnetic Recording Media,
European Patent Application 0304927 (1989); U.S. Patent
No. 5,082,749; and "Dielectric Enhancement Layers for a
Co/Pt Multilayer Magnetooptic Recording Medium", Carcia
et al, Appl. Phys Lett. 58 (1991), pages 191-193.
European Patent Application 0304927 gives an example
wherein the use of silicon decreases the coercivity of
a Co/Pt multilayer structure. For high Co/Pt ratio,
even though coercivity up to 80 KA/m (1000 Oe) can be obtained,
the hysteresis loops are not square. For through
substrate recording, the use of a metal seed layer is
objectionable since it attenuates the Kerr rotation,
decreases the figure of merit and decreases the
recording sensitivity. Some of the dielectrics such as
oxides and nitrides of Zn, In, Al, Ta, Mg, Si, Sn, Fe,
Zr, Bi metals increase the coercivity but the thickness
of these layers is usually recommended to be more than
100 nm for sufficient optical enhancement and 50 nm for  
sufficient coercivity enhancement. This also increases
the deposition time and lowers the production
throughput.It has been noted in the Carcia et al
reference Ibid, that the 100 nm thick seed layer of
In2O3 with 4% Sn enhanced the coercivity of the Co/Pt
multilayer. However, no particulars were discussed
with respect to the seed layer.Also all these dielectrics are highly
crystalline and may give rise to noise during recording
process. Heretofore, it was believed that a highly
crystalline seed layer was required to improve the
texture and growth of the Co/Pt multilayer structures.
Therefore, thick seed layers were needed. Furthermore,
most oxides and nitrides are difficult to deposit using
simple non-reactive dc sputtering at high deposition
rate. The low deposition rate and the large structure
thickness require long deposition time, result in low
production
