<ABSTRACT>
An embossing tool (40) is constructed with the patterning appropriate for the construction of the optical grating structure of a DFB laser. This tool is advanced into the surface of a UV-curable resin layer (51) applied to the surface of a semiconductor slice (50), and the resulting embossed portion of the resin layer (51) is thinned to create ridges (80) separated by intervening windows to form a mask for etching of the channels (81) of a DFB grating structure in the surface of the underlying semiconductor slice.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MANUFACTURE OF GRATING STRUCTURESThis invention relates to the making of grating structures in the surfaces of bodies, particularly, but not necessarily exclusively, the making of optical grating structures in semiconductor bodies such as for instance is called for in the manufacture of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers and distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers.A first order grating for an InGaAsP DFB laser operating at a wavelength of 1330 nm typically has a pitch of about 195 nm, while that of one operating at a wavelength of 1550 nm typically has a pitch of about 230 nm. Additional constraints are clearly required if the system is to be capable of creating phase-shifted gratings.Currently DFB lasers are being produced commercially whose gratings have been produced using e-beam lithography, or using photolithography. In the case of photolithography, a number of different interferometric techniques have been devised for achieving the requisite resolution in the face of difficulties presented by the resolution limit set by classical diffraction theory. A principal problem with e-beam lithography is that the process is essentially a serial one in which each line of each DFB laser has to be separately written. (Typically a period of several hours may be required to write a single two-inch wafer).The present invention is directed to a method of grating structure manufacture which does not necessitate the use of interferometric techniques and thus can avoid the limitations imposed by such use, and which allows repeated use of a tool thereby affording the possibility of a considerable reduction in processing time when engaged in mass production. 

According to the present invention there is provided a method of providing a grating structure in a surface of a body, which method includes the steps of:- providϊng a relief structure embossing tool, applying a layer of a curable material to said surface of the body, advancing said embossing tool into said layer to generate therein a complementary relief pattern, curing the relief patterned layer, eroding the cured relief patterned layer to expose portions of the underlying body in regions thereof registering with the thinner portions of the cured relief patterned layer and leaving residual other portions of the cured relief patterned layer, and etching said exposed portions of the underlying body, using said residual other portions of the layer as mask material for said etching.The present invention may be applied to a semiconductor manufacturing process that
