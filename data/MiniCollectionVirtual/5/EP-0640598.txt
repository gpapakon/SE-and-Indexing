<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an olefin oxide 
comprising oxidizing a corresponding lower olefin with 

molecular oxygen in the gas phase in the presence of a 
crystalline metallosilicate having supported thereon at 

least one salt selected from the group consisting of 
alkali metal salts of nitric acid, alkaline earth metal 

salts of nitric acid, silver salts of nitric acid and 

silver salts of nitrous acid. Said process can produce 
an olefin oxide at a high selectivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
producing an olefin oxide, more particularly to a
process for producing an olefin oxide by oxidizing a
corresponding lower olefin with molecular oxygen in
the gas phase in the presence of a catalyst.Olefin oxides are very important in industry
as industrial chemicals and intermediate materials for
synthetic resins and rubbers, and various processes have
been proposed for oxidizing lower olefins with molecular
oxygen in the gas phase in the presence of a catalyst.Known are, for example, processes using a
silver catalyst (Japanese Patent Application Kokoku No.
53-39,404; Japanese Patent Application Kokoku No. 53-12,489;
USP 4,859,786 and the like), using a copper
phosphate-potassium catalyst (J. of Chemical Society,
Japan, 1978, 468), using a uranium dioxide catalyst
(Japanese patent Application Kokoku No. 48-27,281), a
thallium oxide-cobalt oxide catalyst (Japanese Patent
Application Kokoku No. 49-39,962) and the like.
However, all these processes produce as by-products
large amounts of carbonyl compounds such as carbon
dioxide gas, aldehydes, ketones and the like, so that
they have such a problem that the selectivity of olefin
oxide is low. The object of the present invention is to provide
more effective olefin-oxidizing catalysts for solving the
above problems. These problems have been solved by the
finding that a crystalline metallosilicate catalyst having
supported thereon a salt such as an alkali metal salt of
nitric acid, an alkaline earth metal salt of nitric
acid, a silver salt of nitric acid, a silver salt of
nitrous acid or the like gives an olefin oxide at a high
selectivity.According to this invention, there is provided
a commercially excellent process for producing an olefin
oxide which comprises oxidizing a corresponding lower
olefin with molecular oxygen in the gas phase in the
presence of a catalyst consisting essentially of a
crystalline metallosilicate having supported thereon at
least one salt selected from the group consisting of
alkali metal salts of nitric acid, alkaline earth metal
salts of nitric acid, silver salts of nitric acid and
silver salts of nitrous acid.This invention is characterized by using, as
an olefin-oxidizing catalyst, a crystalline metallosilicate
having supported thereon at least one salt
selected from the group consisting of alkali metal salts
of nitric acid, alkaline earth metal salts of nitric
acid, silver salts of nitric acid and silver salts of 
nitrous acid.The crystalline metallosilicate used as a carrier
is a
