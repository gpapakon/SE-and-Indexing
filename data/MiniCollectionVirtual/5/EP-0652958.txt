<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses the cloning and expression of a lipase modulator gene obtained from a class I (Pseudomonas) species. The expression product of the modulator gene is found to give rise to a considerable increase in lipase production especially upon homologous expression. The present invention provides a method for isolating a class I lipase modulator gene, an isolated modulator gene and a class I (Pseudomonas) transformed with such a gene. Finally the present invention discloses a derivative of plasmid pJRD215 which is segregationally stable in (Pseudomonas).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Cloning and expression of a lipase modulator σene from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaliσenesTechnical field The present invention describes the cloning and expression of a lipase gene in combination with a lipase modulator gene, both obtained from a class I Pseudomonas species, in an homologous class I Pseudomonas species.Background of the invention Lipases are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing lipids they are utilized in a wide range of applications such as fats and oil processing, detergents, diagnostic reagents etc.Extracellular lipases (triacylglycerol acylhydrolases, E.C. 3.1.1.3) are produced by a wide variety of micro- organisms. Suitable microbial lipases have for example been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,950,277, these lipases were obtained from such diverse microorganisms as Pseudomonas. Asperσillus. Pneumococcus. Staphylococcus. ycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycotorula lipolytica and Sclerotinia. It has turned out that especially Pseudomonas lipases have favourable characteristics for the desired applications. Pseudomonas species have therefore been extensively used for obtaining lipases. To increase lipase yield in fermentation several lipase genes have been cloned and expressed in both homologous and heterologous host strains. Examples of the Pseudomonas species from which lipase gene cloning has been reported are; Pseudomonas cepacia (EP 331376) , Pseudomonas glumae (EP 464922) , Pseudomonas pseudoalcaliσenes (EP 334462), Pseudomonas fraσi (EP 318775). During this work it has been found that a lipase modulator gene was necessary to obtain lipase expression in an heterologous host.EP 331376 describes the cloning and expression of a lipase gene obtained from Pseudomonas cepacia in P. cepacia. 

It was found that no expression could be obtained when a second gene located downstream of the lipase gene was deleted. This gene was therefore reported to be essential for lipase production. EP 464922 reports the cloning and expression of a lipase gene together with a gene encoding a protein reported to have a lipase-specific stabilizing/translocation function. The genes are obtained from Pseudomonas qlumae and expression is preferably in heterologous systems. The stabilising protein is reported to differ greatly from the gene described in EP 331376 and therefor assumed to have a different function. WO 91/00908 reports the expression in a heterologous host of the lipase gene and the lipase modulator gene obtained from P. cepacia.Lipase modulator genes, are reported to be essential for obtaining lipase
