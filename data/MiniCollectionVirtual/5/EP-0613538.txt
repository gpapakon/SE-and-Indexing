<CLAIMS>
A sealing device between two interlocking components, 
especially pipes, preferably of concrete, including the following 

features: 

at the interlocking components there are formed sockets (21) 
and spigot ends (22), respectively, which fit into each other 

under intermediate connection of a sliding seal (1); 
the sliding seal (1) is by means of anchorage means (4) fixed 
in the socket (21); 
between the sliding seal (1) and the bottom (26) of the socket 
there extends an annular region (23), into which elements of 

the sliding seal (1) formed as sealing lips can turn off when a 
spigot end (22) is introduced into a socket (21); 
the sliding seal (1) is designed as a compression lip seal (3) 
and is by means of a lip-forming space (5) separated from a 

cellular rubber ring (12) which at least partially occupies the 
annular space (23). 
A sealing device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the lip-forming space (5) has a folding 

section (6) for forming a pivot for the compression lip seal 
(3). 
A sealing device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the lip-forming space (5) has a V-shaped 

cross section. 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized
 in that the socket (21) is in the 
annular region (23) provided with steps for forming chambers 

(24, 25) of different depths, the depths thereof being reduced 
in direction of the bottom (26) of the socket. 
A sealing device as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that the chambers (24, 25) are open after the 

removal of a mould ring (13). 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized
 in that the cellular rubber ring  
 

(12) is a part of a composite filling ring (10) which is positioned 
in the annular region (23).
