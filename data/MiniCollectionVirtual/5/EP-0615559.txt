<ABSTRACT>
A method for anchoring lengths of additive thread/fiber thread (2) in a knitted fabric in an ordinary knitting process, for example, on a circular knitting machine, where a row of vertical needles (10) is continually and successively moved from a lower position up to an upper position and down to a lower position again during formation of knitted stitches (A) interlocked with each other. The fiber thread lengths (2') that are inserted during this ordinary knitting process are anchored in the knitted fabric by the thread ends (2a) of the fiber thread length being deflected backward relative to the knitting direction and brought down between two new stitches (A'', A'') formed by the repeated operation of the needles (10), in two adjacent stitch rows, and being anchored between said stitch rows by the closing of the insertion opening (B) therebetween by the new stitches (A) formed thereafter through the next repeated operation of the needles (10) and by the tightening of the formed stitches. In this manner the ends (2a) of the fiber thread length (2') are securely locked in and project out from the knitted fabric.

<DESCRIPTION>
-METHOD FOR ANCHORING LENGTHS OF ADDITIVE THREAD/FIBER THREAD ON THE BACK SIDE OF A KNITTED FABRIC.The present invention relates to a method for anchoring lengths of additive thread/fiber thread in a knitted fabric in an ordinary knitting process, for example, on a circular knitting machine, where a row of vertical needles is continually and successively moved from a lower position up to an upper position and down to a lower position again during formation of knitted stiches interlocked with each other, as is disclosed in the preamble to the following independent method claim 1.Knitting machines, particularly circular knitting machines or flat knitting machines of the above indicated type, are commonly known and used for knitting fabric having inlaid lengths of additive thread/fiber thread for the provision of a shaggy or napped surface on the knitted fabric produced.By means of the known knitting machines, the inlaid fiber thread lengths are secured to the stitch in which they are inserted only by the formation within said stitch of a new stitch, and the subsequent tightening of the stitches. In other words, when one end of the length of fiber thread is pulled, the thread slides out of its attachment in the knitted fabric.The purpose of the present invention is to provide a better means of anchoring the lengths of fiber thread on the back side of the knitted fabric so that said thread cannot without undue effort be pulled out by drawing on one of its free thread ends projecting up through the preceding stitch through which the last stitched formed with the length of fiber thread was drawn down.This is achieved according to the invention with the aid of the features disclosed in the characterizing part of the 

 following method claim 1 and in the subsequent dependent method claims.The method according to the invention will be described in more detail below, with reference to the drawing, which schematically shows a knitting needle in various positions and in engagement with a stitch thread and a fiber thread during the formation of stitches in a knitted fabric.Figure 1 shows a needle with closed needle head or hook in lower position with a newly formed stitch with an inlaid length of fiber thread,Figures 2, 3A and 3 show, respectively, the needle with open head during Its passage through said stitch to an upper position for catching a length of fiber thread, and subÂ¬ sequent downward movement for picking up a stitch thread,Figure 3B shows the needle head in engagement with the additive thread, which is

1.
A method for anchoring lengths of additive thread/fiber thread in a knitted fabric in an ordinary knitting process on, for example, a circular knitting machine, where a row of vertical needles (10) is continually and successively moved from a lower position up to an upper position and down to a lower position again during formation of knitted stitches (A) interlocked with each other, from stitch threads (1) that are supplied via thread guides (5), for production of knitted fabric, and where during formation of each stitch (A), the needle (10) in upper position is supplied with a fiber thread length (2') from a fiber thread (2), before the needle on downward movement thereof grips the stitch thread (1) and draws this together with the fiber thread length (2') down through a preceding stitch (A) to form a new stitch (A') with inlaid fiber thread length (2') having free thread ends (2a) that project up through the preceding stitch (A), whereafter the needle (10) from lower position is again moved up through the new stitch (A') during simultaneous release of the needle's (10) head (10a) from said stitch and said fiber thread length (2'), to the upper position for supply of a new fiber thread length ( 2 " ) from the fiber thread (2'), whereafter the operation is repeated, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the free thread ends (2a) of the fiber thread length (2') are deflected backward relative to the knitting direction and are brought down between two new stitches (A'', A'') formed by the repeated operation of the needles (10), in two adjacent stitch rows, and are anchored between said stitch rows by the closing of the insertion opening (B) therebetween by the new stitches A (not shown) formed thereafter through the next repeated operation of the needles (10) and by the tightening of the formed stitches, whereby the ends (2a) of the fiber thread length (2') are securely locked in and project out from the knitted fabric. 


 2.
A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the free fiber thread ends (2a) are deflected backward and injected between the last formed stitches (A'', A'') in two adjacent stitch rows, by exertion of a periodic deflection force on the fiber thread ends (2a).
3.
A method according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the deflection force is provided by means of a directed, periodic air jet (C).
4.
A method according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the deflection force is provided by means of a periodically generated negative pressure, whereby the fiber thread ends (2a) are drawn by suction in between said last formed stitches (A" ,A" ).
5.
A method according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the deflection force is provided by means of a periodically generated magnetic field.
6.
A method according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the deflection force is provided by means of a periodically generated electrical field of force (including static electricity).
7.
A method according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the deflection force is provided by means of a mechanical influence. 


8.
A method according to claims 2 - 7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the deflection force is provided by a combination of the aforementioned means, such as a directed air jet (C), negative pressure, magnetic field, electrical field of force and mechanical influence.
