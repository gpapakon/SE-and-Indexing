<ABSTRACT>
An improvement is proposed for a machine which consists of a basic assembly (1) and a tool (3), the transmissions of an analog or a digital information from the basic assembly to the tool being carried out by means of pulse-width-modulated voltage. At the same time, one or more analog or digital items of information can be sent back from the tool (3) to the basic assembly (1) in the form of a current which has been decoupled from the pulse-width-modulated volage. The advantage of this bidirectional data transmission is the high degree of freedom from interference and the insensitivity in terms of thermal influences. As a result, reliable data transmission is made possible under extreme conditions, such as they can be encountered for example in welding technology.
