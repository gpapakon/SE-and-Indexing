<ABSTRACT>
A triglyceride for use in therapy or as a nutritional supplement, or a 
composition containing a triglyceride, wherein the triglyceride comprises a fatty 

acid selected from gamma-linolenic acid and the n-6 EPAs naturally derived 
therefrom and stearidonic acid and the n-3 EFAs naturally derived therefrom, 

forming a triple ester with glycerol or alternatively forming a double ester in 
which the other esterifying acide is a single residue of linoleic acid, with the 

proviso that the di-gammalinolenoyl-mono-linoleoyl glyceride if selected is used 
as a preparation containing more than 20% by weight thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to triglycerides. The essential fatty acids (EFAs) consist of a series of twelve compounds 
illustrated in Table 1 below. Although linoleic acid the parent compound of 
the n-6 series of EFAs, and alpha-linolenic acid the parent compound of the 
n-3 series, are usually the main dietary EFAs, these substances as such have 
relatively minor roles in the body. In order to be fully useful to the body, 
the parent compounds must be metabolized by the sequence of reactions shown 
in Table 1. In quantitative terms, as judged by their levels in cell 
membranes and in other lipid fractions, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) 
and arachidonic acid (AA) are the main EFA metabolites of the n-6 series, 
while eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the 
main metabolites of the n-3 series. DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA are 
important constituents of most of the lipids in the body. As well as being 
important in themselves they can also give rise to a wide range of 
oxygenated derivatives, the eicosanoids, including the prostaglandins, 
leukotrienes and other compounds. The elongation reactions shown in Table 1, in which 2 carbon atoms 
are added to the chain, tend to be rapid, whereas the desaturation reactions in 
which an extra double bond is introduced tend to be very slow. Thus for 
example gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is rapidly converted to DGLA while 
stearidonic acid is readily converted to 20:4n-3 and so these pairs of compounds 
are equivalent in dietary terms. However, DGLA is only slowly converted to  
 
AA. None of the reactions are normally reversible, in man, nor are n-3 and n-6 
series acids inter-convertible. The table is as follows:- 
The acids, which in nature are of the all-cis configuration, are 
systematically named as derivatives of the corresponding octadecanoic, 
eicosanoic or docosanoic acids, e.g. delta-9, 12-octadecadienoic acid or delta-4,7,10,13,16,  
 
19-docosahexaenoic acid, but numerical designations such as, 
correspondingly, 18:2 n-6 or 22:6 n-3 are convenient. Initials, for 
example, EPA for the 20:5 n-3 acid (eicosapentaenoic acid) or DHA for the 
22:6 n-3 acid (docosahexaenoic acid), are also used but do not serve when n-3 
and n-6 acids of the same chain length and degree of unsaturation exist as 
for example with the 22:5 acids. Trivial names in more or less common use 
in the n-6 series are as shown. Of the n-3 series only 18:3 n-3 has a commonly 
used trivial name, alpha-linolenic acid, though the name stearidonic acid 
is coming into use

naturally derived therefrom and stearidonic acid and the n-3 EFAs naturally 
derived therefrom, forming a triple ester with glycerol or alternatively forming a 

double ester in which the other esterifying acide is a single residue of linoleic 
acid, with the proviso that the di-gammalinolenoyl-mono-linoleoyl glyceride if 

selected is used as a preparation containing more than 20% by weight thereof.
