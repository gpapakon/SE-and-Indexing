 TEMPORARY STENT AND METHODS FOR USE AND MANUFACTUREBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to devices known as stents which provide support to a vessel, such as a blood vessel, and in particular to stents that are both temporary and removable.Obstructive coronary artery disease is one of most serious health problems facing our society today. This disease is the result of the deposit of fatty substances on the interior surface of the walls of the arteries. The build up or lesion of such deposits results in a narrowing of the diameter of the artery which restricts the blood flow through the artery. This condition wherein the artery is narrowed is known as stenosis. The lesion may form in any part of the artery and in some instances the deposits may form at the intersection between two arteries, that is, where the section where the two arteries form a generally "Y" configuration (e.g. bifurcate, trifurcate, and so on) .There have been significant developments of the treatment of such obstructive coronary disease in the recent past. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is often used to treat this disease. Bypass surgery, however, has the disadvantage that it is extremely invasive and traumatic to the patient. Some of the recent developments provide a less invasive and less traumatic alternative to bypass surgery. Two of these recent developments are known as angioplasty and atherectomy procedures. 

 Angioplasty is a procedure in which a balloon is positioned on the inside of the artery at the site of the lesion and expanded in order to compress the materials at the lesion and thus open the restricted area in the artery. In this procedure, an elastic balloon is attached to one end of a small diameter flexible catheter which includes means for inflating the balloon from the other end of the catheter. The catheter is maneuvered through the patient's vessels to the site of the lesion with the balloon in uninflated form. When the uninflated balloon is properly positioned at the lesion, the balloon is then inflated to dilatate the restricted area.Atherectomy is a procedure in which a small cutting tool is attached to the end of a small diameter flexible catheter and maneuvered through the patient's arterial system to the site of the lesion in the diseased artery. When the cutting tool is properly positioned, the tool is used to cut and remove the deposits from the surface of the diseased artery.Although these two procedures provide less traumatic alternatives to bypass surgery, they are not without
