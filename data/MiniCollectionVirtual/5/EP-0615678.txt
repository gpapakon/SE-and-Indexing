<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wave soldering of 
elements such as printed wiring boards and more 
specifically to solder coating of wettable metallic 
surfaces for joining at least two wettable metallic 
surfaces on wiring boards in a solder wave wherein the 
wave is blanketed with a reduced oxygen gas atmosphere. Printed wiring boards, circuit boards and other 
elements now have smaller wettable surfaces to be solder 
coated and joined. Whereas in the past flux was used to 
remove oxides from these surfaces, it has now been found 
that if soldering occurs within an inert gas or a shield 
gas atmosphere which excludes oxygen, then flux may not 
be necessary. In the present application, the term 
"inert" as applied to gas includes nitrogen. Furthermore 
dross and other oxides do not form on the surface of 
solder in an inert atmosphere. In the past dross and 
oxide particles have caused skips, bridges, or other 
defects to occur in soldered joints. In US,A,5,048,746 is disclosed a tunnel for 
fluxless soldering. In US,A,5,044,542 is shown 
shield gas wave soldering. In both cases solder is 
applied to an element in a shield gas environment. The 
shield gas may be inert gas or a reducing gas which 
excludes oxygen. The benefits of soldering in an 
atmosphere which excludes oxygen are known. Tardoskegyi in US,A,3,705,457 and Elliott 
in U.S. patent application Serial No. 549,603 both 
disclose the use of a gas knife jet. US,A, 
4,402,448, 4,679,720 and 4,995,411 
disclose the uses of gas or air knife  
 
jets for cleaning surface mounted conductor elements 
carried by printed circuit boards. One of the problems with flux in the past is that 
the flux itself caused a deposit or residue on the solder 
coated surfaces after solder coating and this residue 
generally had to be removed by cleaning after soldering. 
However, flux technology has improved and it is now 
possible to use what is sometimes referred to as a "no-clean" 
flux which does not leave a residue and does not 
require solder coated surfaces to be cleaned after solder 
coating. The term "no-clean" flux is applied to a flux 
which leaves a low level of residue on solder, the 
residue generally being non-corrosive and non-conductive. 
One example of a no-clean flux contains little or no 
halide, another example is a non-corrosive and non-conductive 
organic acid dissolved in an ethanol or 
isopropanol solvent. A further example is common RMA 
flux which is a mixture of a rosin, such as abietic acid, 
an activator, such as divethylamine
