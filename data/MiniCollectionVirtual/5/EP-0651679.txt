<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field
of screening apparatus for sorting wood chips and
similar articles. More specifically the invention relates to a wood
chip screen apparatus comprising the features of the preamble portion
of claim 1.In a typical bar screen apparatus for wood
chips, with a length on the order of 10 feet, there
often arises a problem of maintaining adequate bar
rigidity, i.e. stiffness, over the entire length of the
bars. Without sufficient stiffness, the bars deflect to
an extent, particularly near mid-length, such that the
size of the screen openings will vary over the length of
the screen, degrading performance and predictability of
results. To correct this, the bars comprising the
screen typically have a fairly large thickness, so that
the percentage of the screen area that is open to
passage of acceptable-size material is only
approximately 35%. Alternatively, the individual bars
can be supported in some fashion at various points along
the lengths thereof. These intermediate support
elements can interfere, however, with the passage of
acceptable-size material.In addition to the above-described undesirable
deflection effect which occurs over the length of the
bars, there is often difficulty in obtaining adequately
straight bars from a manufacturer, i.e. the bars are
often slightly bowed or crooked. Bars having the
required straightness are initially expensive, and also 
are expensive to replace. In general, such bar screens are expensive to
maintain.A wood chip screen apparatus as mentioned at the beginning is known from
W092/05881. In this prior art apparatus a plurality of parallel bars are supported
at their respective ends in such a manner and driven in such a manner that each
bar moves both longitudinally and vertically.From US-A-2,727,627 a screening apparatus having a plurality of individual
screen bars is known. These screen bars which are flat metal strips are held in
taut condition. When the individual screen bars are held under tension and the
screen intercepts solids from a stream of liquid flowing through said screen, such
solids might strike the screen with sufficient force to tend to flex or distort the
screen bars. Any screen bar may flex slightly in the transverse direction thereby
deforming a spring, which spring will immediately return to its normal position
and stretch the screen bar as soon as the force is discontinued.Further, from DE-A-80022 a sieve comprising a plurality of wires is known.
Further, DE-A-80022 discloses a plurality of tensioning
