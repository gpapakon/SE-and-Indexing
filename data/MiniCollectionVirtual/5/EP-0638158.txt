<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for maintaining a nominal working temperature of the flue gases in a PFBC power plant during partial load operation of the plant by arranging firing of a complementary fuel in the flue gases downstream of the uppermost tubes in the bed. This firing is achieved by injecting a fuel, mixing it well into the flue gases, and igniting it. By the combustion of the complementary fuel, the temperature of flue gases leaving the combustor is raised to the nominal working temperature of the flue gases. During continuous combustion of a complementary fuel downstream of the uppermost tubes in the bed, this method also makes possible an optimization of temperature levels for the bed and the flue gases by allowing these levels to deviate somewhat from one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method, during operation 
of a PFBC power plant, for increasing the performance and 
maintaining low emissions of gaseous environmental pollutants 
under all load conditions, in particular during 
partial load operation of the plant, by optimizing the 
temperature level of the flue gases generated in the plant. 
The optimization of the flue gas temperature is attained by 
firing of a complementary fuel supplied to the flue gases. During combustion of particular fuel, usually coal, in a 
pressurized fluidized bed in a PFBC power plant, the bed is 
supplied with combustion air in the form of compressed air 
from the pressure vessel which surrounds a combustor, in 
which the fluidized bed is arranged, via fluidization 
nozzles below the bed. The flue gases which are generated 
during the combustion process pass, in the combustor, 
through a freeboard above the bed surface, are cleaned and 
supplied to a gas turbine. The flue gases drive the gas 
turbine, which in turn drives a generator as well as a 
compressor which supplies the pressure vessel with 
compressed air. The combustion air, the flue gases and the 
devices which handle these gases are comprised in the gas 
cycle of the plant. The gas cycle thus includes, inter alia, 
the gas turbine. Such a plant is known from US-A-4 974 411. For cooling the bed to a temperature of the order of magnitude 
of 850°C, a steam generator in the form a tube bundle, 
which constitutes a component in a steam cycle, is placed in 
the bed. The designation tube bundle is used here to 
describe a component which is, per se, usually divided into 
a plurality of tube bundles. Steam is generated in the tube 
bundle, energy being extracted from the bed via the steam  
 
turbines to which the steam is passed in the steam cycle. At 
full load the entire tube bundle is within the bed. The 
cooling capacity of the tube bundle must be dimensioned to 
the power output from the bed to be able to maintain the 
correct bed temperature during full load operation of the 
plant. If the reduction of the power output is achieved by a 
reduced fuel supply, the power generation in the bed is 
decreased, while at the same time the cooling capacity of 
the tube bundle is unchanged, which entails an undesired 
reduction of the bed temperature. The cooling capacity of 
the tube bundle in the bed can be reduced by lowering the 
bed level, whereby part of the tube bundle will be located 
above the surface of the bed. As a consequence of this, a 
load change in the
