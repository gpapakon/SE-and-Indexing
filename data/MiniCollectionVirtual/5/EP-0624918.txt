<ABSTRACT>
Antenna system wherein the separate transmit 
and receive microstrip antennas each has respective 

arrays of radiating patch elements. Each of the antennas 
is fed from a single end thereof so that each antenna 

creates four beams. Beam pitch angles are introduced 
into each antenna so as to reduce the coupling between 

adjacent lines to allow the gap within each connected 
line pair to be reduced. This gap reduction provides 

room for the antennas to be interleaved within a common 
rectangular aperture so that the separate feeds are at 

opposite ends of the aperture. Each antenna then 
utilizes the entire aperture. Isolation means are 

provided between the lines of the transmit and receive 
antennas so as to reduce the mutual coupling therebetween 

and maintain the minimum required sixty dB isolation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Doppler radar navigation 
systems and, more particularly, to an improved 
transmit/receive antenna system for such a navigation 
system which is particularly well adapted for overwater 
use and which utilizes the entire available aperture for 
each of the transmit and receive antennas so as to 
maximize antenna gain. Antennas for overwater Doppler radar navigation 
systems must satisfy very stringent requirements. The 
type of antenna typically used for such an application is 
commonly referred to as a microstrip antenna and is 
formed as a planar printed circuit on a substrate, the 
circuit comprising an array of parallel lines of serially 
interconnected radiating rectangular patch elements. The 
antenna is mounted to the underbelly of an aircraft 
fuselage within a rectangular aperture formed by the ribs 
of the fuselage. Thus, the maximum size of the antenna 
is constrained by the spacing between the ribs. These 
Doppler antennas generate time shared beams within the 
defined aperture. Since beam width is inversely 
proportional to aperture size, and antenna gain is 
directly proportional to aperture size, one requirement 
is to utilize as much of the aperture as possible for 
each beam.  
 For Doppler systems that fly over both land and water, 
the navigation accuracy is impacted by a shift in the 
measured Doppler frequency due to the backscattering over 
water which is a function of the incidence angle (the 
angle from the vertical) and the actual sea state. The 
calmer the sea (the lower the sea state) the larger the 
Doppler error from land to sea because the sea has more 
of a mirror effect. It is therefore another requirement 
of such an antenna that it have the inherent ability to 
shape the beams so that they have contours which result 
in Doppler shifts which are essentially invariant with 
backscattering surface. For FM/CW Doppler systems, the minimum required 
isolation between the transmit and receive antenna ports 
is sixty dB. This results in the requirement of two 
separate (space duplexed) transmit and receive antennas, 
rather than a single time duplexed antenna. Since these 
antennas must both occupy the same aperture, in the past 
this has limited the full usage of the aperture for each 
of the antennas and conflicts with the requirement for 
narrow beam width, as well as impacting on the achievable 
antenna gain. Another requirement of such an antenna system is that 
it be inherently temperature and frequency compensated. Planar microstrip antennas for
