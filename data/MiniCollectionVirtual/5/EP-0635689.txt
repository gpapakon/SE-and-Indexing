<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
refrigerator showcase enabling to smoothly dispose of dewing 

occurring on an upper surface (22a) of a glass door (2); the showcase in 
which the door includes a frame body (21) having a form similar to a 

picture frame; a transparent glass (22) mounted inside the frame 
body; a drainage passage (38) formed inside the frame body (21) located 

in the supported side of the door; and a water collection 
portion (44) formed in a portion where the frame body (21) contacts the 

upper surface (22a) of the transparent glass in the supported side of 
the door; whereby the drainage passage (38) connects a space formed 

above the transparent glass to the machine room, and the water 
collection portion (44) slopes down to the drainage passage (38) in the 

open state of the door.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigerator showcase for 
displaying and selling food such as ice cream. The refrigerator showcase of this type generally cools, as 
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Application No. 
Hei 2-6988 (F25D23/02), a storeroom provided inside an 
insulating box body thereof by a cooling apparatus. The 
insulating box body being open upward is usually closed by a 
glass door capable of opening and closing. The glass door is 
supported in the back end of the insulating box body rotatably 
in the upper and lower side directions. The showcase displays 
and keeps food in the storeroom so as to enable to pick the 
food out by holding up the front side of the glass door to open 
it. A refrigerator showcase of another type, as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-open Application No. Hei 3-30071 
(F25D23/02), cools a storeroom provided inside an insulating 
wall thereof by a cooling apparatus. The insulating wall being 
open forward is usually closed by a glass door capable of 
opening and closing and rotatably supported by the insulating  
 
wall. The showcase displays and keeps food in the storeroom so 
as to enable customers to see the inside through the glass door 
during selecting food and open the door for picking the food 
out. When such refrigerator showcases are applied for 
displaying and selling frozen food such as ice cream, each 
storeroom is cooled at freezing temperature below the freezing 
point, so that dewing can easily occur on the upper surface of 
the glass door exposing to the air. The dewing occurring on 
the upper surface of the glass door deteriorates the view of 
the inside. Furthermore, drops of dew can be splashed outward 
from the lowest position of the glass door when the door is 
opened thus making the vicinity of the showcase dirty. In order to prevent the problems mentioned above, the 
conventional showcase disclosed in the Japanese Patent Laid-open 
Application No. Hei 3-30071 provides a glass door in which 
a printed heater is stuck on the opposite surface to that 
facing the outside. The glass door with such a heater, 
however, increases the cost in manufacturing. Also, the heater 
is less useful to prevent the frame body of the door from 
dewing, so that another heater can be required for prevention 
of the dewing to frame body. Furthermore, the heater runs hot 
all over the glass door so as to affect the storeroom side in 
temperature. In other words, the heater makes the temperature 
of the storeroom high, so that a load of the cooling
