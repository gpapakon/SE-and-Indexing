<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power converter, and more
particularly to a power converter in which a plurality of
neutral point clamped (NPC: Neutral Point Clamped) inverters
are connected in common to a DC voltage source and which
supplies the AC power obtained by these inverters to a load.In prior art, there are some systems composed of two
NPC inverters which have a common DC power source, as shown
in Figure 11 as an example. That is to say, a rectifier 2
is connected to a 3-phase AC power source 1, and a DC
smoothing capacitor 15 composed of a positive side smoothing
capacitor 3 and a negative side smoothing capacitor 4 is
connected to rectifier 2. Also, a first NPC inverter 5 and
a second NPC inverter 6 are connected in parallel to DC
smoothing capacitor 15.The output sides of NPC inverters 5 and 6 are connected 
to a motor 91, which has two sets of 3-phase windings with
the same number of polarities, as shown in Figure 10. The
AC power obtained by NPC inverters 5 and 6 is supplied to
motor 91. Specifically, the U, V and W phase outputs of
first NPC inverter 5 are connected to windings U1, V1 and W1
of motor 91, respectively. Also, the U, V and W phase
outputs of second NPC inverter 6 are connected to windings
U2, V2 and W2 of motor 91, respectively.Gate signals are supplied to gates of NPC inverters 5
and 6 from a gate signal generating system composed of a
controller 10, first and second comparators 12 and 13 and a
carrier generation circuit 14. The motor speed of motor 91 is
detected by a speed detector 8 and fed back to controller 10
which composes a 3-phase voltage reference generation system
92. Speed control is exercised therein using this feedback
data and an inputted speed reference. Motor currents of
motor 91 detected by current detectors 9 connected to the
output side of NPC inverter 5 are also fed back to
controller 10 and current control is exercised therein. A 3-phase
voltage reference Vref1 (only one phase component
thereof is shown), which is the current control output, is
outputted from controller 10. This 3-phase voltage
reference Vref1 is inputted to each of comparators 12 and
13, and is compared in amplitude with a carrier generated by
carrier generation circuit 14 therein. Thus, the gate
signal for NPC inverter 5 and the gate signal for NPC 
inverter 6 are generated in comparators 12 and 13,
respectively. Details of the system shown in Figure 11 are
described in U.S.P. 5,274,542 issued on December 28, 1993.As shown in Figure 11, NPC inverters 5 and 6 are
connected to rectifier 2.
