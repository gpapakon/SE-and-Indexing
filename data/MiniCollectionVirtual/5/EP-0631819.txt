<ABSTRACT>
A waste disposer comprises a shredder section (2) for shredding waste 
material and a water remover section (3) coupled integrally with the 

shredder section for removing water from the waste material, in which 
the shredded waste material is carried upward throughout a cylindrical 

screen member (54) mounted in the water remover section (3) by the 
rotation of a screw (53) while its water content is removed and drained 

through apertures of the screen member. A plurality of vertically 
extending rib portions (54B) are arranged at equal intervals on the 

inner wall of the screen member (54) so that the screw blade (53B) comes 
into direct contact with the rib portions during its rotation. A 

plurality of pins (60) are provided at equal intervals on the outer edge 
of the screw blade (53B), each pin (60) having a length sufficient to 

run directly on the inner wall of the screen member (54) as the screw 
(53) rotates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waste disposer for 
grinding and removing raw waste material created in a 
kitchen. Waste disposers are commonly used for grinding and 
removing raw waste material produced in kitchens, each 
comprising a shredder for shredding the waste material and a 
water remover for removing water from the shredded waste 
material which both are assembled in a unit. More specifically, such a traditional waste disposer 
comprises a shredder section communicating with a drain 
outlet of a kitchen sink and a water remover section for 
removing water from the shredded waste material. In action, 
raw material is fed into the shredder section of the disposer 
where it is shredded with a supply of water, and the shredded 
waste material is transferred into a cylindrical screen 
member of the water remover section where it is carried 
upward by means of rotation of a screw blade while its water 
content is removed through apertures of the screen member. 
After the removal of water, the shredded waste material with 
a minimum of water is disposed from the upper end of the 
screen member into a waste container. However, the traditional waste disposer permits the shredded 
waste material to be carried upward throughout the screen 
member by the rotation of the screw while being pressed 
against and turned in a circle along the inner wall of the 
screen member, and thus discharged out from the upper end of 
the screen member in the form of masses which contain a 
considerable amount of water. Hence, when such masses of the 
shredded waste material are stored in the waste container, 
they rot and easily generate odor. Also, the shredded waste  
 
material turns in the screen member as the screw rotates and 
will thus be carried upward with less efficiency. Furthermore, sticky portions of the shredded waste material 
tend to stay between the screw and the lower inner wall of 
the screen member disturbing the flow of water and 
discouraging the smooth action of the waste disposer. An 
object of the present invention is to provide an improved 
waste disposer which comprises a shredder section 
communicating with a drain hole of a sink in a kitchen for 
shredding waste material and a water remover section coupled 
integrally with the shredder section for removing water from 
the waste material, in which water disposer the waste 
material is fed together with a supply of water into and 
shredded within the shredder section, and the shredded waste 
material is carried upward throughout a cylindrical
