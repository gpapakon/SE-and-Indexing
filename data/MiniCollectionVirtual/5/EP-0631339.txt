provide a secondary battery of high safety and high 

energy density. 
The battery of the present invention is a 
lithium secondary battery at 

least formed of negative electrode active material, 
a separator, positive electrode active material, 

electrolytic solution (electrolyte), a collector and 
a battery case, characterized 

by the presence of phosphorus type - and/or halogen type flame retardant 
in said electrolyte solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to batteries with
high safety, and more particularly to secondary
batteries maintaining high safety even after repeated
uses and having higher energy density.Recently, it is foreseen that the earth will
be increasingly warmer due to greenhouse effect with
the increase of CO2, which makes it difficult to
construct new thermal power plants, and thus a so-called
load leveling has been devised which permits
the effective use of generated electric power by storing
night power into the secondary batteries installed
in general homes to level the load for more efficient
utilization. Also, there are increasingly the demand
for developing small, lightweight secondary batteries
having high energy density for use with the electric
automobiles which exhaust no air pollutant, and the
demand for developing secondary batteries of high
performance for use with the power sources of the
portable equipments such as book-type personal computer,
word processor, video camera, and portable telephone.As the above-mentioned secondary battery of
high performance, a rocking chair type lithium ion 
battery has been developed in which positive electrode
active material has lithium ions introduced into
intercalation compound, and negative electrode active
material is made of carbon, and partially put to
practical use. However, such lithium ion battery has
lower energy density than lithium battery which uses
metal lithium for the negative electrode active material.The reason why no lithium accumulator of high
capacity which uses lithium metal for the negative
electrode has not been practically used is considered
due to the fact that the occurrence of lithium dendrite
(dendritic crystal) which is produced by repetitive
charge and discharge and mainly causes short-circuit
has not been successfully suppressed. When dendrite
of lithium grows to cause a short-circuit between
positive and negative electrodes, the energy of battery
will be consumed in a short time to produce the heat.
The heating will decompose the solvent of electrolyte
to produce gases, which increases the inner pressure
and eventually may result in some explosion. Also,
there is a problem of accident that heating may cause
a fire. Accordingly, the development of safe accumulator
not bringing about such accident is desired.Also, in the battery involving chemical
reaction and having the possibility of firing, the
development of safe battery not causing such accident
is desired. EP-A-0 486 704 discloses an organic electrolytic battery
