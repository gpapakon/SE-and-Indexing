A packaging recipient for alimentary products, 
of receptacle type, more specifically intended to 

receive materials capable of generating exudates during 
storage, in particular aliments and other consumable 

foodstuffs, this recipient being made up of a bottom 
part (2) from which extend transversal and longitudinal 

peripheral sides so as to form a container obtained by 
forming a composite material comprising an upper layer 

and a lower layer made of a synthetic material 
impermeable to liquids between which is inserted at 

least one intermediate absorbent and/or adsorbent layer 
communicating with the upper layer via perforations 

pierced through the latter, the surface (S) of the 
intermediate absorbent or adsorbent layer (8) being 

smaller than the evolute surface (S1) of the container 
formed by the layers (6, 7) made of synthetic material, 

its positioning with respect to the latter being 
substantially centered (0) along the X and Y axes, so 

as to allow a peripheral strip (3, 4, 5) free from 
absorbent or adsorbent material to remain around the 

lining, characterised in that each absorbent or 
adsorbent intermediate layer or lining (8) is made up, 

fully or in part, of at least one absorbent or 
adsorbent inorganic material, possibly associated to an 

organic material having the same properties or 
properties compatible with its use, in that the 

peripheral strip (3, 4, 5) is suited to enable the 
joining together of the two upper (6) and lower (7) 

layers throughout their entire periphery with a 
homogenous thickness, thus avoiding that an empty 

peripheral space remains between the periphery of the 
intermediate layer (8) and the area where the upper (6)  

 
intermediate layer (8) and the area where the upper (6) 

and lower
 
(7) layers are joined, and in that the upper layer (6) 

is perforated with microperforations (9), truncated for 
example, performed at right angles to the absorbent 

intermediate layer (8). 
A packaging recipient according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the inorganic material making up 

the intermediate layer (8) is in powder form. 
A packaging recipient according to claims 1 or 
2, characterised in that the organic material and/or 

the inorganic material is in expanded form. 
A packaging recipient according to any of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the organic or 

inorganic material particles are associated to a 
support or to a binding agent forming a support with 

said particles. 
A packaging recipient according to any of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the inorganic 

material is selected from the group made up of perlite, 
dehydrated silica gels, inorganic salts, activated 

carbon, ores and minerals having physico-chemical 
properties which are appropriate for their use. 
A packaging recipient according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the lower layer (7) is obtained 

from an extrudable and thermoformable expanded plastic 
material. 
A packaging recipient according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the expanded plastic material 

forming the lower layer (7) is selected from amongst 
the expanded polystyrenes and polyethylenes. 
A packaging recipient according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the upper layer (6) is a plastic  

 
material selected from amongst the polystyrenes, 

polyethylenes, polyvinyl chlorides and polycarbonates. 
A packaging recipient according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the film making up the upper 

layer (6) has a constitution of a type making it 
possible to impress a decorative and/or advertising 

pattern. 
A method for the manufacture of a material 
with several layers (6, 7, 8) mainly intended to 

produce packaging recipients of receptacle type 
according to any of claims 1 to 9, comprising the 

following successive steps: 

a - preparing a strip or sheet of plastic foam 
(20) intended to make up the lower layer of the 

composite material, by extruding an expanded plastic 
material; 
b - applying a positive thermal gradient (W) to 
the lower layer so as to make it adhesive; 
c - disposing (32), on the lower layer (7) made 
adhesive, an absorbent or adsorbent intermediate layer 

(8); 
d - placing an extruded plastic film (22) making 
up the upper layer (6) of the composite material so as 

to completely cover the lower layer (7); 
e - calendering, in a calendering device, the 
three layers (6, 7, 8) of the composite material thus 

obtained, so as to join the plastic film making up the 
upper layer (6) with the lower layer (7) made of 

expanded plastic foam material throughout the totality 
of the areas not occupied by the absorbent or adsorbent 

intermediate layer (8), surrounding the latter; 
f - shaping a blank (1A) thus obtained by 
thermoforming so as to produce a number of containers 

each having the appropriate shape, and then separating  
 

the containers by cutting so as to obtain the packaging 
recipients ; 
 
   characterised in that, in step (c), the 

intermediate layer (8) is obtained from a non-rigid 
width of material discontinuously fed (7, 10) to a 

positioning station (31, 32) where it is sized 
according to a predetermined surface (S) and disposed 

on said lower layer (7) according to predetermined 
reference points (A, B, C, D) with respect to the 

center (0);
 
   in that, in steps (e) and (f) 


the film (6) of plastic material is perforated, 
in a perforation station, at right angles to absorbent 

or adsorbent intermediate layer (8), according to the 
same positional reference points (A, B, C, D) of the 

latter; 
the complex thus formed is rolled up on spools

hours; and in that, after step (f):

A method according to claim 10, characterised 
in that the sheets or strips (11) are arranged in 

multi-laying so as to obtain a simultaneous execution 
of these various operations. 
A method according to claim 10, characterised

polystyrene crystal is applied on the composite 
material so that it adheres to the upper layer (6). 
A device for implementing a method according

absorbent or adsorbent material transversally into 
unitary intermediate layers, means to center and 

position unitary absorbent or adsorbent sheets on the 
sheet of expanded polystyrene, means to apply an upper 

layer on the assembly made up of the unitary 
intermediate layers and the lower layer, means to 

perforate the upper layer, means for rolling up for
