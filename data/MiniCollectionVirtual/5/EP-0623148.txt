<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions of
acrylonitrile polymers and to the processing and use
of the compositions for the formation of films,
particularly barrier films, fibers, co-extruded
articles and foams.It has long been recognized that acrylonitrile
polymers, and co-polymers containing acrylonitrile,
produce films, fibers and other articles having
desirable properties. Such products of particular
interest are barrier films for use in product
packaging. It has also long been recognized that
certain aspects of polyacrylonitrile ("PAN")
products need to be improved. First, there is a
need for improved and easier processing. Secondly,
there is a need for improved and more complete
removal of the unreacted acrylonitrile monomer
during processing of the polyacrylonitrile, because
the presence of monomer is undesirable in food and
drug packaging products. Thirdly, there is a need
to improve the barrier properties of acrylonitrile
polymers and co-polymers. Fourthly, it is desirable
that strength properties, particularly tensile
strength, of acrylonitrile polymers and co-polymers
be increased.Acrylonitrile polymers composed of 90 weight
percent or more of acrylonitrile monomer are 
generally not melt processable. When heated, they
char before the melt can be processed at
temperatures commonly used in plastics processing
equipment.Shaped articles made from such polymers are
presently limited to the production of fibers by
dissolving such polymers in a polar solvent, forcing
the resulting "syrup" through a spinnerette to form
fibers, coagulating them in a heated atmosphere (dry
spinning) or in a fluid bath (wet spinning),
tensilizing by stretching, and drying by heat
volatilization. Solvent vapors are condensed,
purified and reused. Such processing is termed
"solution" or "solvent" casting.Experimental acrylonitrile homopolymer and
copolymer thin films have been made by solution
casting as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,437,717 to
Isley et al. A melt extrusion blown film process is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,536,365 to Zwick, and
in U.S. Patent No. 4,144,299 to Inoue et al.
Another melt reaction-extrusion process utilizing a
water leaching system to remove the solvent
component prior to biaxially stretching such formed
film is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,066,731 to
Hungerford. Film property data taken from such
acrylonitrile films show them to have many desirable
mechanical, physical, chemical and electrical values
for multipurpose use applications. Such films are
clear, tough, resistant to
