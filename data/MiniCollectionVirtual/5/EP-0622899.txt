<ABSTRACT>
A data converter employs at least one minimum phase FIR filter 
(132,160,230,240 or 252), and includes an analog-to-digital converter (220) for 

converting an incoming analog signal into a plurality of digital signal samples, 
followed by a minimum phase FIR filter to filter the digital signal samples. 

Alternatively, the data converter includes a digital-to-analog converter (170) 
preceded by a minimum phase FIR filter to filter a plurality of digital signal samples 

that are converted into an analog signal by the digital-to-analog converter. The data 
converter may include both an analog-to-digital converter (220) and a digital-to-analog 

converter (170). In a preferred embodiment, the minimum phase FIR filter 
(132,160,230,240 or 252) is an optimum minimum phase FIR filter. A method for 

precisely calculating the filter coefficients of an optimum minimum phase FIR filter 
is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to echo canceling and particularly to 
minimum phase finite impulse response (FIR) filters for attenuating the echo signal 
in communications circuits and a method for calculating tap weights of a minimum 
phase FIR filter. The phenomena of signal echo occurs when a signal passes through an 
interface from a first transmission medium to a second transmission medium. An 
impedance mismatch across the interface will cause a portion of the energy of the 
signal to be reflected back toward the source of the signal as an echo signal. The 
remaining portion of the energy of the signal propagates along the second medium. In communication applications, it is desirable to eliminate the echo 
signal, for example, to improve the quality of audio signals or prevent the occurrence 
of errors in data transmission. Basic echo cancellation techniques are explained in: 
the Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 59, No. 2, February 1980, pp. 149-159. One 
echo elimination technique discussed in the above journal is to detect when a signal 
is being transmitted in one direction and to attenuate all signals passing in the other 
direction. Errors in detecting the presence or absence of a signal can cause signal 
clipping when this echo elimination technique is used. Another technique utilizes 
subtractive attenuation. To eliminate the echo, the echo is replicated, such as being 
synthesized by an adaptive filter, then subtracted from the signal. Subtractive 
attenuation is more signal transparent and reduces signal clipping effects. Another form of subtractive attenuation is achieved with an echo 
canceler having fixed coefficients designed to approximate the impulse response of 
the echo path. Since the impulse response of the echo path is not known, this 
technique results in imperfect echo canceling. More precise echo canceling is 
achieved when the echo canceler is adaptive. In an adaptive echo canceler, the tap 
weights of the echo canceler filter are changed over time to replicate the impulse 
response of the unknown echo path. If a FIR filter structure is employed in an echo path, the filter would 
ideally require an infinite number of tap weights since the unknown echo path 
generally has an impulse response of infinite duration. An adaptive infinite impulse 
response filter having only a few tap weights could be used to achieve the necessary 
echo cancellation. Adaptive infinite impulse response filters, however, may become  
 
unstable. As a compromise, an adaptive FIR filter,
