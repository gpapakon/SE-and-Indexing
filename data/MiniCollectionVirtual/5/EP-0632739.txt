<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are described for separating the components of an emulsion comprising an electrically conductive component dispersed in a continuous phase of a substantially electrically insulating component, for instance, a water-in-oil emulsion. The method includes the steps of introducing bubbles of an electrically insulating gas into the emulsion, whilst simultaneously applying an electric or electrostatic field across the emulsion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
separating emulsions, in particular water-in-oil emulsions, 
into their component phases. Existing techniques whereby a water-in-oil emulsion may be 
resolved into its constituent phases make use of chemical and 
physical means for achieving the resolution. The need for an emulsion breaking operation may arise in 
connection with a wide variety of processes. For example, in 
the production of crude oil at the well-head, where saline 
formation water is present as fine stable droplets in the oil 
coming to the surface, it is necessary to break the emulsion 
in order to dehydrate the oil. In other cases, it may be essential to recover the components 
of an emulsion after it has been deliberately created for a 
specific purpose. This occurs in processes using emulsion 
liquid membrane technology where, for instance, a very stable 
water-in-oil emulsion is used to treat an aqueous effluent 
feed stream to remove an impurity. The species to be removed 
from the aqueous feed stream transfers through the outer oil 
phase of the emulsion into the water droplets or internal 
phase of the emulsion. To encourage this mass transfer to 
occur it is necessary to have some appropriate chemical or 
physical driving force. A simple example of such a process 
is the extraction of ammonia from an effluent water into an 
emulsion of sulphuric acid in kerosene. A crucial feature of the economics of processes that employ 
emulsion liquid membranes concerns the ability to re-use the 
oil phase repeatedly. Economic viability depends on being 
able to break the used emulsion speedily to remove the spent  
 
internal phase in bulk and recycle the oil phase to make fresh 
emulsion for re-use. In the oil industry, crude oil emulsions that are slow to 
resolve using a purely physical method such as gravity 
separation, can often be treated with chemical additives which 
serve to destabilise the emulsion. However, the latter course 
of action is not feasible for liquid membrane emulsions. Here 
the desire to recreate a stable emulsion using the separated 
oil phase mitigates against the use of chemical demulsifiers. 
In the case of liquid membrane emulsions it is therefore 
necessary to consider the use of physical methods alone to 
speed up the separation of an emulsion. In general, the resolution of emulsions requires that the 
small droplets of the dispersed (internal) phase coalesce 
together, until they become large enough to be removed easily 
from the continuous phase.
