<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an infrared radiator especially for use in animal rearing, which with its optimized burner geometry increases the primary radiation in the direction of the area to be heated up, and reduces the heat losses on the upper side of the burner, makes possible maintenance-free operation over long periods of time by means of its novel air filtration, and makes possible an extremely low carbon monoxide content in the combustion gases via a system of a combustion-air optimization by supplying secondary air in the injector pipe.

Gas-operated infrared radiator for heating purposes, 
mainly in the building trade and in animal husbandry, 

having a gas burner with air supply and an incandescent 
tube or similar incandescent element, optionally with 

reflector, a filter element being disposed in the air 
supply, characterized in that the air supply duct (3) is 

routed along a burner region which heats up during the 
operation of the burner and in that the filter element 

(10), which has heat-resistant filter bcdies, is disposed 
in said region. 
Infrared radiator according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the air supply duct (3) is routed along that 

side of the burner which is remote from the radiating 
surface of the burner and is in contiguous contact with 

the latter. 
Infrared radiator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a part of the air supply duct (3) forms 

that base part of the incandescent tube or of the incandescent 
element (1) which is remote from the radiating 

surface. 
Infrared radiator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the filter element (10) is composed 

of heat-resistant metal, in particular steel, or of 
inorganic material. 
Infrared radiator according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the filter element (10) is composed 

of wire mesh, perforated metal sheets, porous filter 
plates, honeycomb bodies or similar elements through 

which flow can take place. 
Infrared radiator according to one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

wherein the air supply duct and a gas nozzle open into an 
injector tube which leads to the mixing chamber of the 

burner, characterized in that at least one secondary air 
duct (4) links the air supply duct (3) to the mixing tube 

(2). 
Infrared radiator according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the incandescent element (1) is 

formed by a trough segment which is mounted on a wall of 
the air supply duct (3) by
 means of its base and which 
has a semicircular or triangular cross section or is 

designed as hemispherical segment, as pyramid or truncated 
pyramid, cone or truncated cone.
