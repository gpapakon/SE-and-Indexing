<CLAIMS>
A self-extinguishing thermoplastic polyurethane
comprising at least one flame retardant and, if

desired, effective amounts of further auxiliaries
and/or additives which are customary per se, wherein

the flame retardants present comprise at least one
compound selected from the group consisting of organic

phosphates and organic phosphonates and, in addition to
the organic phosphates and/or organic phosphonates,

melamine cyanurate.
A self-extinguishing thermoplastic polyurethane
as claimed in claim 1, wherein the flame retardants

present comprise at least one organic phosphate of the
formula (I)



where R are substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl
or phenyl groups and n = 1-15.
A self-extinguishing thermoplastic polyurethane
as claimed in claim 2, wherein the flame retardants

present comprise organic phosphates of the formula (I)
in which R = phenyl or alkyl-substituted phenyl.
A self-extinguishing thermoplastic polyurethane
as claimed in claim 1, wherein the flame retardants

present comprise at least one organic phosphonate of
the formula (II) 



where

R
1
are substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl
or phenyl groups and the two radicals R
1
 can also
be linked to one another to form a ring and
R
2
is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl
or phenyl radical.
A self-extinguishing thermoplastic polyurethane
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the

thermoplastic polyurethane is a polyaddition product
derived from one or more diisocyanates, one or more

relatively high molecular weight polyester diols and
also one or more low molecular weight diols as chain

extenders.
A self-extinguishing thermoplastic polyurethane
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 comprising, in each

case based on the mixture of thermoplastic polyurethane
and flame retardant, from 35 to 80% by weight, in

particular from 50 to 75% by weight, of the thermoplastic
polyurethane, from 3 to 15% by weight,

preferably from 5 to 12% by weight, of organic
phosphates and/or organic phosphonates and up to 50% by

weight, in particular from 10 to 40% by weight, of
melamine cyanurate.
A process for preparing self-extinguishing
thermoplastic polyurethanes as claimed in any of

claims 1 to 6 by reacting

a) organic and/or modified organic diisocyanates with
b) relatively high molecular weight polyhydroxyl
compounds and, if desired,
c) chain extenders in the presence of
d) at least one flame retardant,
e) at least one catalyst and, if desired,
f) further auxiliaries and/or additives,

wherein the flame retardants used comprise at least one
compound selected from the group consisting of organic

phosphates and organic phosphonates and, in addition to 
the organic phosphates and/or organic phosphonates,

melamine cyanurate.
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
relatively high molecular weight polyhydroxyl compounds

(b) are polyester diols.
