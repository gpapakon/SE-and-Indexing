<ABSTRACT>
For binding the sheets of a printed product (14) consisting of several sheets, such as magazines, brochures and the like, the sheets are glued together at some points by introducing an adhesive into passages formed in said sheets. In this case, the adhesive applied on the outside of driving-in and boring needles (20) is transferred onto the sheets over the entire length of the passages at the same time as the passages are formed by means of said needles (20) and/or when the needles (20) are retracted.

Method for binding the sheets of a multiple-sheet 
printed product, such as magazines, brochures and the like, 

in which the sheets are glued with each other in a 
punctiform manner through the introduction of an adhesive 

into passages formed therein, characterised in that the 
adhesive is introduced from the exterior in depressions on 

the outer side of a penetrating tool and the adhesive, 
situated on the outer side of the penetrating tool, 

simultaneously with the formation of the passages by means 
of the penetrating tool and/or with the removal of the 

penetrating tool, is transferred onto the sheets over the 
entire length of the passages. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
transfer of the adhesive onto the sheets takes place with an 

inward or outward rotational movement of the penetrating 
tool. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
passages are produced with rotatable driving-in or boring 

needles representing the penetrating tool, in which the 
driving-in or boring needles are arranged either in at least 

one row on a common supporting beam or in a support for the 
sheets. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterised in that to 
receive and transfer the adhesive, the driving-in or boring 

needles are provided with thread-like grooves forming the 
depressions. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
driving-in or extraction speed and the rotational speed of 

the driving-in or boring needles are selected so as to be 
adapted to the thread pitch.  

 
Method according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
driving-in or extraction speed and the rotational speed of 

the driving-in or boring needles are selected so as not to 
be adapted to the thread pitch. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the driving-in speed is selected so as 

to be deviating from the extraction speed, and/or that the 
rotational speed on driving in of the driving-in or boring 

needles is selected to be different from the rotational 
speed on extraction thereof, in which one of these speeds 

can also be zero, and/or that the rotational speed is varied 
during the driving in or during the extraction. 
Method according to one of Claims 3 to 7, characterised 
in that the sheets during the gluing process are carried by 

a support which has depressions or openings, arranged 
corresponding to the spacings of the driving-in or boring 

needles, to receive the points of these needles. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the adhesive is applied immediately 

before the driving in of the driving-in or boring needles 
from the exterior onto the latter. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the adhesive is applied from the 

exterior onto the driving-in or boring needles after the 
penetration of the sheets and before the extraction 

movement. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the sheets, lying one on top of the 

other, are glued with each other in a punctiform manner 
along 
a line, which coincides with the fold edge of the 
finished product.  

 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that an adhesive is used which after the 

introduction into the passages is subjected to a subsequent 
treatment, e.g. a heat treatment. 
Apparatus for binding the sheets of a multiple-sheet 
printed product, such as magazines, brochures and the like, 

in which in the sheets (14), supported on a base (10), 
passages (52) are formed by means of penetrating tools (20), 

into which adhesive is introduced, in particular for 
carrying out the method according to one or more of Claims 

1 to 12, characterised in that the penetrating tool has 
several driving-in or boring needles (20) in each case 

having a closed point (54), which needles (20) are provided 
on their outer sides with depressions, such as grooves or 

channels (21, 60) for example, receiving the adhesive and 
transferring it to the wails of the passages (52), and that 

an adhesive supply device (32, 46) is provided for the 
application of adhesive from the exterior to the outer side 

of the driving-in or boring needles (20) before the 
penetration of the boring- or driving-in needles (20) into 

the sheets and/or before the removal of the boring- or 
driving-in needles (20) out of the sheets. 
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterised by a 
rotary drive for the driving-in or boring needles (20), in 

which the rotary drive is preferably reversible. 
Apparatus according to Claim 13 or 14, characterised in 
that a device is provided for advancing or withdrawing the 

driving-in or boring needles (20) and also a pressing device 
(30) is provided, which presses onto the stack of sheets 

(14) on the driving in or extraction of the driving-in or 
boring needles (20). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 13 to 15,
