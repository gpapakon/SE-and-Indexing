<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for cleaning sewer ducts by flushing by means of water, in the case of which provision is made for a flushing apparatus which is equipped with a cleaning nozzle (6) and is supplied with high pressure water by a high pressure water pump, and for a suction/pressure unit which acts as a water jet pump and is terminated by a suction head (7). The motive water for the water jet pump is produced by a second liquid pump. Both the cleaning nozzle (6) and the suction head (7) are fed by a common high pressure water pump (2), it being possible for the high pressure water jet which is produced by the high pressure water pump (2) to be divided up by a three-way valve (4) into a liquid jet which is fed to the flushing head (6) and a liquid jet which acts as motive water for the suction head (7), designed as an ejector. A water treatment apparatus (13) exhibits a coarse filter, a hydrocyclone and a fine filter.

A device for cleaning sewer conduits by rinsing with 
water and removal of sludge by suction, having: 


a) a removable vehicle fixture (14) comprising: 

a1) a water tank (1); 
a2) a high-pressure pump (2) which is connected to 
the water tank (1); 
a3) a diesel unit (3) which drives the high-pressure 
pump (2); 
a4) a three-way valve (4) which is disposed on the 
output side of the high-pressure pump (2) and 

divides the stream of liquid and conveys it to 
a cleaning nozzle (6), which can be introduced 

into the sewer conduit, and/or to a 
suction/output unit which can also be 

introduced into the sewer conduit, acts as a 
water jet pump and ends with a suction basket 

(7), with the part of the stream of liquid 
conveyed to the unit serving as motive water 

for the suction basket (7) constructed as a jet 
suction device. 
a5) a hose reel (5) for coiling and guiding the 
hose leading from the three-way valve (4) to 

the cleaning nozzle (6); 
a6) a water treatment apparatus (13), which is 
connected to the water tank (1) and filters the 

water to a very high degree of purity; 
b) a removable trailer fixture (15) comprising: 

b1) a sludge tank (9) with collecting vat (11) and 
coarse filter apparatus (10), which is 

connected via a delivery hose (8) to the 
suction/output unit (7); 
b2) a waste water pump (12), which conveys the 
service water from the collecting vat (11) of  

 
the sludge tank (9) via a pipe (17) into the 

water treatment apparatus (13); and 
b3) rapid action couplings, which produce the hose 
connections from the trailer fixture (15) to 

the vehicle fixture (14) and to the 
suction/output unit (7) without any problems.
