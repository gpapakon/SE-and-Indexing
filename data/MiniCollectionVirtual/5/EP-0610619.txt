<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a polyvinyl chloride and wood composite 
pellet by extrusion, in which the polyvinyl chloride and wood 

fibre are introduced into the extruder in a ratio of 
approximately 6:4 by weight. The polyvinyl chloride is melted 

and blended with the wood fibre so that the interstitial voids 
of the wood fibre are filled with polyvinyl chloride. After 

being extruded through a die, the molten material is cut into 
pellets having a bulk density of preferably between 0.7 and 

0.8 g.mm⁻³.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an extrusion process for
making a polymer/wood composite pellet. The pellet can be used
in the production of structural members of window and door
components.Conventional window and door manufacture has commonly used wood
and metal components in forming structural members.
Residential windows are commonly manufactured from milled wood
products that are assembled with glass to form double hung or
casement units. Wood windows while structurally sound, useful
and well adapted for use in many residential installations, can
deteriorate under certain circumstances. Wood windows also
require painting and other periodic maintenance. Wood windows
also suffer from cost problems related to the availability of
suitable wood for construction. Clear wood products are slowly
becoming more scarce and are becoming more expensive as demand
increases. Metal components are often combined with glass and
formed into single unit sliding windows. Metal windows
typically suffer from substantial energy loss during winter
months.Extruded thermoplastic materials have been used in window and
door manufacture. Filled and unfilled thermoplastics have been
extruded into useful seals, trim, weatherstripping, coatings,
and other window construction components. Thermoplastic
materials, such as polyvinyl chloride, have been combined with
wood members in the production of windows sold by Andersen
Corporation for many years under the trade mark PERMASHIELD.
The technology used in the production of such windows is
disclosed in US-2926729 and US-3432883, and is used in the
application plastic coatings or envelopes on wooden or other
structural members. Generally, the cladding or coating
technology used in making such windows involves extruding a
thin polyvinyl chloride coating or envelope surrounding a
wooden structural member. Polymer materials have combined with cellulosic fibre to make
extruded materials. However, such materials have not
successfully been used in the form of a structural member that
is a direct replacement for wood. Common extruded
thermoplastic composite materials cannot provide thermal and
structural properties similar to wood or other structural
materials. These extruded materials fail to have sufficient
modulus, compressive strength, coefficient of thermal expansion
that matches wood to produce a direct replacement material.
Polymer and organic material mixtures of this type, which fail
to provide structural properties, are typified by FR-A-22703ll
and JP 92086042. FR-A-2270311

A process for the manufacture of a pellet composite
comprising thermoplastic polymer and cellulosic fibre, which

method comprises:

(a) introducing a blend of at least about 30% of a
thermoplastic polymer composition and at least about 30%

of a cellulosic fibre into an extruder which comprises an
inlet zone, a second zone, a barrel and a pellet die, the

amounts being expressed by weight as a proportion of the
total weight of the fibre and the polymer;
(b) melting the polymer composition in the barrel and
blending the polymer composition with fibre under

conditions of sufficient temperature, pressure and shear
to cause the polymer composition to mix with the fibre to

the extent that the cells of the fibre are disrupted and
the polymer composition occupies greater than 50% of the

interior volume of the cells of the fibre to form a
polymer fibre composite;

a pellet;

fibre and polymer to the density of the pellet is less than

0.8.
