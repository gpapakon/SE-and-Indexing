<ABSTRACT>
The scaffolding platform (7), of rectangular overall shape, includes retractable hooks (10) at its ends towards its four corners, these hooks being mounted so that they can pivot about horizontal pins (13). The pivoting hooks (10) lock onto the horizontal bars (6) of the ladder elements (3) belonging to the vertical structure of the scaffolding, but these hooks (10) retract into the overall size of the platform (7) when the platform is being lifted up. The platform (7) is hoisted up and lowered by means of hauling cables or ropes (16, 17) attached (at 15', 15'') to the hooks (10) and which can be operated from the ground or from a winch borne by the platform (7). This device applies more particularly to moving scaffolding.

Scaffold platform, particularly a mobile-scaffold 
platform, the scaffold platform (7), rectangular in shape 

overall, having at its opposite ends means (10) for hooking 
onto horizontal bars (6) belonging to vertical ladders (3), 

themselves forming part of the vertical structure of a 
scaffold, the hooking-on means comprising in total four hooks 

(10) mounted so as to pivot, at the ends of the platform (6), 
about pins (13) which, in the mounted position of the 

platform, are substantially horizontal and extend parallel to 
the bars (6) on the ladders (3), the hooks (10) normally 

projecting at the ends of the platform (7) but being 
retractable by pivoting within the overall dimensions of the 

platform (7), notably when the bars (6) on the ladders (3) 
pass, these pivoting hooks (10) having in their top part (12) 

a slope configuration (14) enabling them to retract 
automatically when a bar (6) passes, and then to reposition 

themselves automatically above this bar (6), during a rising 
movement of the platform (7), characterised in that the said 

pivoting hooks (10), situated outside the longitudinal edges 
of the frame (8) of the platform (7), respectively close to 

its four corners, have, towards the two ends, respectively 
inner and outer, of their top part (12), anchoring points 

(15', 15") for a traction rope or cable (16, 17, 20) used for 
hoisting or lowering this platform (7) within the vertical 

structure of the scaffold, the anchoring point (15', 15") used 
tending to align itself on the vertical to the pivot pins (13) 

when the traction rope or cable (16, 17, 20) is tensioned.  
 
Scaffold platform according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that each pivoting hook (10) has an overall T 

shape, with an elongate arm (11), the bottom end of which is 
mounted so as to pivot about a horizontal pin (13) connected 

to the frame (8) of the platform (7), and the top end of which 
is attached to a broadened top part
 (12) forming a hooking-on 
nose designed to cooperate with a bar (6), the top part (12) 

having, above the hooking-on nose, an inclined or curved edge 
(14) forming the slope designed to cooperate with the bars (6) 

for the purpose of the retraction of the hook (10). 
Scaffold platform according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the two pivoting hooks (10) situated on 

each side of the platform (7) at the same end of the latter 
are connected to each other by a cross member (21). 
Scaffold platform according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the cross member (21) connects the 

respective top parts (12) of the two pivoting hooks (10), 
passing above the frame (8) of the platform (7). 
Scaffold erection system, notably for a mobile 
scaffold, using the scaffold platform (7) with pivoting hooks 

(10) according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that it comprises at least two traction ropes or cables (16, 

17), the ends (20) of which are attached to the anchoring 
points (15', 15") provided on the top parts (12) of the said 

hooks (10), and which pass over respective return pulleys (18, 
19), with a substantially horizontal axis, positioned towards 

the top of the ladders (3) on the vertical structure of the 
scaffold.  

 
Scaffold erection system according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the two traction ropes (16, 17) 

associated respectively with the two ends of the scaffold 
platform (7) each have, in addition to their length extending 

between the pivoting hooks (10) and the corresponding return 
pulley (18, 19), another length extending from the 

corresponding return pulley (18, 19) as far as the ground, so 
as to be able to be actuated by operators stationed on the 

ground. 
Scaffold erection system according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the two traction cables (16, 17) 

associated respectively with the two ends of the scaffold 
platform (7) each have, in addition to their length extending 

between the pivoting hooks (10) and the corresponding return 
pulley (18, 19), another length extending from the 

corresponding return pulley (18, 19) as far as a winch (23, 
24) carried by the scaffold platform (7) itself, so that the 

winches (23, 24) can be actuated or controlled by operators 
stationed on this platform (7). 
Scaffold erection system according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the return pulleys (18, 19) are carried 

by respective cross members (25, 26), mounted removably at the 
top of the last ladder elements (3, 3', 3"). 
Scaffold erection system according to any one of 
Claims 5 to 8, characterised in that each traction rope or 

cable (16, 17) is subdivided into two end parts (20) attached 
respectively to the anchoring points (15', 15") of the two 

hooks (10) situated at the same end of the platform (7).
