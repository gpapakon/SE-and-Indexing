<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a construction for 
automatically milking animals, such as cows, with a milking 

parlour (1) and a milking robot (11). The construction 
comprises a massaging device (12, 107) moving up and down for 

massaging an animal's udder for such purposes as stimulation of 
the blood f
low and commencement of the milk flow. In a first 
embodiment, the massaging device is a teat cup (108); in a 

second embodiment it is a disc (93) made of a flexible 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a construction is known from document
Robotereinsatz in der Landwirtschaft am Beispiel des Melkens Tagung Brauschweig-VÃ¶lkenrode 5/6 Dezember 1990 p. 111-126.It is an object of the invention to improve the
quality of the milk.Therefore, according to the invention, the
construction comprises the features as defined in claim 1.The construction according to the invention
has the advantage that both the foremilking and the
milking take place in the same milking parlour, which is
of course time saving.Further, the invention is characterized in that
the construction comprises an up and downward movable
massaging device for massaging an animal's udder.
Massaging the udder stimulates the animal to relax the
teats, so that, when a teat cup is connected, the milk
starts flowing sooner. This enables a gain in time to be
obtained for each animal to be milked.According to another feature of the invention,
the massaging device is fitted on a robot arm.
According to a further feature of the invention, the robot
arm is made up of a first part and a second part, with the
foremilking device being fitted on the second part.According to another feature of the invention,
the second part of the robot arm is made up of a
parallelogram/link gear, and on a first arm of this parallelogram/link
gear there is provided a motor driving an
eccentric disposed pivotably in a connecting member,
whose other end is pivotably connected with a second
arm of the parallelogram/link gear.According to another feature of the invention,
the first part as well as the second part of the robot
arm is designed as a parallelogram/link gear. Owing to
the fact that the first part of the robot arm is designed as
a parallelogram/link gear, the height of the massaging
device is adjustable in a simple manner.According to a further embodiment of the
invention, the first part of the robot arm comprises a
motor driving an eccentric pivotably disposed in a connecting
member, whose other end is pivotably connected
with the second part of the robot arm.In accordance with a feature of the invention,
the two exemplary embodiments of the massaging
device comprise means, with the help of which a cleaning
and/or disinfecting fluid can be supplied to the massaging
device. The massaging device as well as the
teats and a part of the udder are cleaned by means of
this cleaing and/or disinfecting fluid. According to a further
feature of the invention, in either case the means
comprise
