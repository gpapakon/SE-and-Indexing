<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to herbicidal compositions
comprising as active ingredients a 1,3-oxazin-4-one derivative
and a known sulphonylurea derivative. The compositions show
broad herbicidal spectra and sufficient herbicidal effects at
low doses.Many herbicides are in practical use, for example in
paddy fields. Even today, however, it is desirable to develop
herbicides with better herbicidal effects, for example without
phytotoxicity against rice plants, with a wide herbicidal
spectrum, and effective at low doses. However, the known
herbicides do not satisfy these requirements.The present inventors have carried out intensive
studies to develop herbicides satisfying the above
requirements, and have now found such a herbicidal composition
by combining certain 1,3-oxazin-4-one derivatives and certain
known sulfonylurea derivatives. It has been found that such
novel herbicidal compositions can control selectively and
synergistically a broad spectrum of weeds in paddy fields.
Consequently they can be used at lower doses and with a wider
herbicidal spectrum than expected.The herbicidal compositions of this invention are
characterized by containing as active ingredients the following
two components, (A): at least one 1,3-oxazin-4-one derivative 
(hereinafter referred to as "Component A") of the formula:

wherein R is a methyl or ethyl group, Y is a halogen atom, a
C1-6 alkyl group unsubstituted or substituted by one or more
halogen atoms, or a C1-6 alkoxy group unsubstituted or
substituted by one or more halogen atoms, and n is 0, 1, 2 or
3; and (B): a sulfonylurea derivative (hereinafter referred
to as "Component B") such as 1-{[ortho-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)phenyl]sulfamoyl}-3-(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)urea,
also
known as cyclosulfamuron; the said compositions comprising also
an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier.1,3-Oxazin-4-one derivatives represented by the
general formula (I), which can be used as Component A in the
herbicidal compositions of this invention, and the detailed
descriptions of their preparation, have been disclosed in the
description of published European patent application 605 726.In the definition of the group Y, "halogen atom"
means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.Examples of C1-6 alkyl groups substituted by one or
more halogen atoms include bromomethyl, dichloromethyl,
trifluoromethyl, 2-iodoethyl, 1-chloroethyl, 3-chloropropyl,
2-methyl-2-chloropropyl and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl.Examples of C1-6 alkoxy groups substituted by one or
more halogen atoms include
