<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fabricating alloy lined reaction 
vessels or processing equipment, and to protecting joints within such vessels. One method frequently used in the chemical industry for solving 
severe corrosion problems is to explosively bond or clad a thin layer of a relatively 
expensive corrosion resistant metal or alloy upon a lower cost, base metal thereby 
obtaining a composite possessing corrosion resistance while minimizing use of 
relatively expensive metals. Fabricating equipment from such composites can be 
difficult, especially when the cladding or lining material has dissimilar metallurgical 
properties in comparison to the base metal. For example, should the coefficients of 
thermal expansion for the cladding and base metals be sufficiently dissimilar, the 
two layers of the composite will typically separate upon cyclic heating and cooling. Another difficulty may occur at welded joints, which are located 
between adjacent sections of the composites, because of the high temperatures that 
are associated with welding certain metals. For example, when metals are heated 
above their recrystallization temperature, as may occur during welding, some grains 
will grow at the expense of others until a larger average grain size is attained which 
typically reduces the ductility of the metal. The resulting poor ductility at the joints 
may cause mechanical failure of the joint when exposed to the repeated thermal 
stresses which are caused by cyclically heating and cooling the composite. A 59% by weight molybdenum-41% rhenium alloy (Mo41%Re) is 
commercially available, and has achieved important industrial applications because 
of its combination of high temperature strength, corrosion resistance, and 
workability. This molybdenum alloy has a coefficient of linear expansion with 
temperature which is about only half that of a base metal such as Hastelloy C-276 
and carbon steel, whereas the alloy's modulus of elasticity is one and one half times 
as great. Because of the high stresses which will develop between the cladding and 
base layers during high temperature reactor or process vessel operation, 
conventional welded joints are expected to eventually separate and fail when 
exposed to cyclic heating and cooling. Furthermore, should a joint be exposed to a  
 
highly corrosive environment, even a minute crack which penetrates the Mo41%Re 
layer will rapidly corrode and cause failure of the entire equipment or vessel.
