A multilayered breast box of a paper machine for the production of a 
web of paper with several layers with different characteristics, characterised in 

that 

1.1 in at least one layer for the setting of the weight per unit area 
cross-section, sectional volume flows with individually adjustable stock density 

are provided; 
1.2 in at least one other layer for the setting of the fibre orientation 
cross-section, sectional volume flows with adjustable through flow are provided. 
A mulilayered breast box according to Claim 1, characterised in that in 
each individual layer either solely the sectional fibre orientation or solely the 

sectional weight per unit area is influenced. 
A multilayered breast box according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that precisely two layers are provided, in which: 


3.1 in the first layer for the setting of the weight per unit area cross-section, 
sectional volume flows with individually adjustable stock density are provided; 

and 
3.2 in the second layer for the setting of the fibre orientation cross-section, 
sectional volume flows with adjustable through flow are provided. 
A multi-layered breast box according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that exactly three layers are provided, in which: 


4.1 in the central layer for the setting of the weight per unit area 
cross-section, sectional volume flows with individually adjustable stock density 

are provided; 
4.2 in at least one peripheral layer for the setting of the fibre orientation 
cross-section, sectional volume flows with adjustable through flow are provided. 
A wet part of a paper machine for the formation of a multilayered web 
of paper, in which:
 
5.1 at least two breast boxes are provided in succession;
 
characterised in that
 
5.2 the breast boxes, connected in series, are provided over the machine 

width with sectioned supply of material; in which 

5.2.1 at least one breast box is provided for influencing the fibre orientation 
cross-section with a through flow which is adjustable in a sectioned manner with 

respect to the volume flow; 
5.2.2 at least one breast box is provided for influencing the weight per unit 
area cross-section with individualy adjustable section flow supply with respect to 

the stock density. 
A method for the production of a multi-ply / multilayered web of paper 
with the following features: 


6.1 several layers/plies of material suspension are supplied to the screen 
section(s); in which 
6.2 in at least one layer/ply the fibre orientation cross-section is influenced; 
6.3 in at least one other layer/ply the weight per unit area cross-section is 
influenced. 
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that in each case the 
influencing of the fibre orientation and of the weight per unit area is carried out 

so as to be uninfluenced by each other. 
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that in each case the 
influencing of the fibre orientation and of the weight per unit area is carried out 

uninfluenced and independently of each other in different layers/plies.  
 
A method according to one of Claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the 
influencing of the fibre orientation is carried out with the aid of adjustable, 

sectional volume flow through-flows. 
A method according to one of Claims 6 to 9, characterised in that the 
weight per unit area cross-section is carried out with the aid of adjustable 

sectional substance suspension densities. 
A method according to one of Claims 6 to 10, characterised in that the 
adjustment of the sectional volume flow through-flows takes place at least also 

with the aid of a shutter at the outlet gap. 
A method according to one of Claims 6 to 11, characterised in that the 
adjustment of the sectional volume flow through-flows takes place at least also 

with the aid of a changeable resistance to flow in front of the outlet gap.
