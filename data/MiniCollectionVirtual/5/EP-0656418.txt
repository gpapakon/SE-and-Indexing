<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a DNA construct comprising a functional vector for 
expression in 
E. coli
 comprising in downstream order of transcription: (1) a promoter, (2) 
a ribosomal binding site, (3) an initiation codon, (4) a human cytoplasmic Cu/Zn superoxide 

dismutase structural gene, or alleles thereof, in reading frame with said initiation codon 
having a stop codon at the 3'-terminus of said gene and (5) a transcription terminator, 

wherein said DNA construct, upon expression in 
E. coli
, expresses non-acetylated active 
human cytoplasmic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. The invention also provides a method for 

preparing a polypeptide comprising non-acetylated enzymatically active human cytoplasmic 
Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase that differs by 
no more than four amino acids from naturally-occurring 
human cytoplasmic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, said method comprising growing 


E. coli
 containing a DNA construct of the invention in a nutrient medium and isolating the 
resulting non-acetylated enzymatically active human cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase.

<DESCRIPTION>
Superoxide dismutase ("SOD") is in fact a
variety of different enzymes found in most living
organisms. One function in mammals is to destroy
superoxide, a material naturally produced during
phagocytosis. The superoxide dismutases are characterized
in families based on the metal associated with
the enzyme, where the metals vary amongst iron,
manganese, copper and copper-zinc. Superoxide
dismutase, e.g., from bovine liver, has found clinical
use, particularly as an anti-inflammatory agent in
mammals including humans. Other utilities include
scavenging superoxide anions due to exposure of a host
to various superoxide-inducing agents, e.g. radiation,
paraquat, etc.; prophylaxis or therapy for certain
degenerative diseases, e.g., emphysema; food
preservation; and the like.It is therefore important that stable
supplies of physiologically acceptable superoxide
dismutase be made available, particularly for use in
vivo as an anti-inflammatory agent or for other therapeutic
purposes. For human application it would be
preferable to employ the homologous enzyme to prevent
or minimize possible immune response. By employing
recombinant DNA techniques, there is the opportunity to
produce products efficiently, which have the desired
biological activities of superoxide dismutase, such as
immunological and enzymatic activities. The amino acid sequence of human erythrocyte Cu-Zn
superoxide dismutase is described in Jabusch et al.,
Biochemistry (1980) 19:2310-2316 and Barra et al., FEBS
Letters (1980) 120:53:55. Bovine erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD is
described by Steinman et al.,J. Biol. Chem. (1974)
249:7326-7338. A SOD-1 cDNA clone is described by Lieman-Hurwitz
et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA (1982) 79:2808-2811.
Concerning the effect on efficiency of translation of
varying the untranslated region upstream from the
initiation codon, see Gheysen et al., Gene (1982) 17 :55-63;
Thummel et al., J. Virol. (1981) 37 :683-697; and
Matteucci and Heyneker, Nucl.AcidsRes . (1983) 11:3113-3121.
Sherman et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci USA (1983)
80:5465-5469, discloses the nucleotide sequence and
expression of human chromosome 21-encoded superoxide
dismutase mRNA.Efficient production of polypeptides demonstrating
the biological activity of human Cu-Zn superoxide
dismutase is demonstrated by the preparation of cDNA of
the major portion of the structural gene, linking to a
mixture of adapters providing for varying sequences
extending from the ribosomal binding site to degenerate
nucleotides in the coding region, and insertion of the
complete
