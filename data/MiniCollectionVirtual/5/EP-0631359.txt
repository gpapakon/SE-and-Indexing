<CLAIMS>
Cable sleeve of plastic, comprising a slit sleeve 
tube (1) and sealing end bodies, having a continuous 

sealing insert (2-3) in the regions of the circumferential 
surfaces of the sealing bodies and of the longitudinal 

closure, the continuous sealing insert (2-3) being 
arranged right along and fixedly on the sleeve tube (1), 

at least in the corresponding sealing regions (2, 3), 
characterized in that the surface (11) of the strip-shaped 

sealing insert (10) is designed in a wave form 
transversely to the sealing direction, or in that the 

surface of the sealing insert (14) has a plurality of 
parallel-running notches (15) transversely to the sealing 

direction. 
Cable sleeve according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the distances between the parallel-running 

profilings are unequal. 
Cable sleeve of plastic, comprising a slit sleeve 
tube (1) and sealing end bodies, having a continuous 

sealing insert (2-3) in the regions of the circumferential 
surfaces of the sealing bodies and of the longitudinal 

closure, the continuous sealing insert (2-3) being 
arranged right along and fixedly on the sleeve tube (1), 

at least in the corresponding sealing regions (2, 3), 
characterized in that parallel-running lamellae (21) are 

arranged transversely to the sealing direction on the 
surface of the sealing insert (20). 
Cable sleeve according to one of the preceding 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the parallel-running 

elevations (25), notches (27) or lamellae (21) have  
 

different heights. 
Cable sleeve according to one of the preceding 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that different surface 

profilings (31) are combined with one another on the 
sealing surface of the sealing insert (30). 
Cable sleeve according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that additional sealing profiles 

(29) are provided on the surface of the sealing insert 
(28).
