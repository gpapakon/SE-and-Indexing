<ABSTRACT>
A snap action hinged closure (10) for a container (25), which closure comprises a body (11) having an outlet opening therein for attachment to the container and a cap (12) pivotally connected to the body by way of a hinge (13) and adapted to close the outlet opening in a closed position thereof. The body has a resiliently deflectable cantilevered arm (17) attached by its proximal end thereto and on the distal end of which arm the hinge (13) is provided. The cap (12) has a member (24) which is dimensioned and positioned relative to the body and the cap, so that when the cap is rotated about the hinge (13) to a mid-position shown between an open position and said closed position, the member (24) contacts the body (11) and deflects the arm (17) relative to the body whereby the resilience of the arm acts on the member to urge the cap from said mid-position into the respective one of the open and closed positions.

 CLOSURES FOR CONTAINERSBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to closures for containers and in particular, although not exclusively, to closures suitable for use on containers such as toothpaste tubes or the like.2. Description of the Related ArtThe invention is concerned with closures that have snap action caps in which the cap is biased by a snap action device into both of a closed position, where the cap closes the open top of the container, and an open position, where the cap is well clear of the open top of the container. Whilst it is relatively easy to produce a closure with a snap action having a large diameter cap, it is not so easy to provide such snap action on small diameter caps of the size usually used for collapsible tubes such as toothpaste tubes.In GB-A-1503121 there is disclosed a snap action cap in which the body of the closure has a rigid tongue (16) and the cap has a flexible blade (17) which bears on the tongue (16) and provides the bias to move the cap to and from the open and closed positions. In this design the hinge is mounted on a substantially rigid part of the body and hence not only has to take the wear and tear as a hinge, but is subjected to tensile loads which could accelerate wear of the hinge.In US-A-4625898 there is shown two embodiments of an invention concerning snap action closures. The embodiment of Figures 11 to 18 comprises a hinged cap in which a film hinge is mounted on a substantially rigid part of the body. The cap has two lugs (430, 432) which bear against the body to slide against the body and elastically deform the film hinge. In a second embodiment shown in Figures 19 and 20, 

flexible "posts" are formed on the body against which the lugs slide, but here again the film hinge is mounted on a rigid part of the body and is subjected to tensile loads as well as the normal wear and tear of a hinge.The present invention seeks to provide a snap action closure which is easy to open and close and provides a durable biasing means and hinge means to achieve the snap action.The closure to which this invention relates achieves the durability of the biasing means and hinge means by making the biasing means in the form of a resilient cantilevered arm on which the hinge is mounted.Summary of the InvnetionAccording to the invention there is provided a snap action hinged closure for a container, which closure comprises a body having an outlet opening therein for attachment to the container and a cap pivotally connected to the body by

CLAIMS
1. A snap action hinged closure for a container, which closure comprises a body having an outlet opening therein for attachment to the container and a cap pivotally connected to the body by way of a hinge means and adapted to close the outlet opening in a closed position thereof, said body having a resiliently deflectable cantilevered arm attached by its proximal end thereto and on the distal end of which arm the hinge means is provided, and the cap having a member which is dimensioned and positioned relative to the body and the cap, so that when the cap is rotated about the hinge means to a mid position between an open position and said closed position, the member contacts the body and deflects the arm relative to the body whereby the resilience of the arm acts on the member to urge the cap from said mid position into the respective one of the open and closed positions.
2. A closure according to claim 1, wherein the body comprises an end wall which has the outlet opening therein and a skirt portion which has means for attaching the body to a container, the proximal end of the cantilevered arm being connected to the skirt at the free edge of the skirt portion.
3. A closure according to claim 2, wherein the skirt portion is moulded to form a recess between the body and the arm.
4. A closure according to claim 1, wherein the arm is provided with a cut-out at a position along the length of the pivotal axis of the hinge means and the member is dimensioned and positioned relative to the cap and the cutÂ¬ out, so that, when the cap is in the closed position, the member is accommodated in the cut-out and lies in the plane of the cantilevered arm. 


 5. A closure according to claim 4, wherein the hinge means is spaced a distance (x) from the body when the cap is in the closed position and the member has a dimension (y) , measured radially from the pivotal axis of the hinge means, which is greater than (x) .
6. A closure according to claim 4, wherein the cut-out is provided at an intermediate position along the pivotal axis of the hinge means.
7. A closure according to claim 1, wherein the body is provided with a deformable portion against which said member engages in the mid position of the cap, flexing of the deformable member augmenting the resilience of the arm in generating the force to urge the cap from said mid position into the respective one of the open and closed positions.
8. A closure according to claim 1, in which there are two cantilever arms provided, one on each side of the member.
9. A closure according to claim 1, wherein the hinge means is a plastics film hinge.
