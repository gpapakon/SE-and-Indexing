<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is use of a vitreous inorganic fibre in the knowledge that it has a composition meeting the criterion that the calculated sum of the free energies of hydration of the compounds that would or could be present at equilibrium (on the basis of knowledge, informed belief or reasonable assumption) is more negative than -10 kcal/100 grams of composition. Such compositions are saline soluble.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to saline soluble, non-metallic,
amorphous, inorganic oxide, refractory fibrous materials.Inorganic fibrous materials are well known and widely
used for many purposes (e.g. as thermal or acoustic insulation
in bulk, mat, or blanket form, as vacuum-formed shapes, as
vacuum formed boards and papers, and as ropes, yarns or
textiles; as a reinforcing fibre for building materials; as a
constituent of brake blocks for vehicles). In most of these
applications the properties for which inorganic fibrous
materials are used require resistance to heat, and often
resistance to aggressive chemical environments.Inorganic fibrous materials can be either glassy or
crystalline. Asbestos is an inorganic fibrous material one
form of which has been strongly implicated in respiratory
disease.It is still not clear what the causative mechanism is
that relates some asbestos with disease but some researchers
believe that the mechanism is mechanical and size related.
Asbestos of a critical size can pierce cells in the body and
so, through long and repeated cell injury, have a bad
effect on health.Whether this mechanism is true or not regulatory agencies
have indicated a desire to categorise any inorganic fibre
product that has a respiratory fraction as 'hazardous',
regardless of whether there is any evidence to support such
categorisation. Unfortunately for many of the applications
for which inorganic fibres are used, there are no realistic
substitutes. Accordingly there is a demand for inorganic fibres that
will pose as little risk as possible (if any) and for which
there are objective grounds to believe them safe.A line of study has proposed that if inorganic fibres
were made that were sufficiently soluble in physiological
fluids that their residence time in the human body was short;
then damage would not occur or at least be minimised. As
the risk of asbestos-linked disease appears to depend very
much on the length of exposure this idea appears reasonable.
Asbestos is extremely insoluble.As intercellular fluid is saline in nature the importance
of fibre solubility in saline solution has long been
recognised. If fibres are soluble in physiological saline
solution then, provided the dissolved components are not
toxic, the fibres should be safer than fibres which are not so
soluble. The shorter the time a fibre is resident in the body
the less damage it can do. H. Förster in 'The behaviour of
mineral fibres in physiological solutions' (Proceedings of
1982 WHO IARC Conference, Copenhagen, Volume 2, pages
