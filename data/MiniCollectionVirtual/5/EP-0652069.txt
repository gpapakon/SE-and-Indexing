<ABSTRACT>
A frame (9) is coupled to a Remotely Operable 
Service Arm (ROSA) robotic arm, and a rotatable carousel 

(1), in turn, is carried by the frame to position several 
tool modules (2,3,4,5) used in a welding operation adjacent 

to a damaged tube (12a) in a tubesheet (16) of a nuclear 
steam generator (7). The arm positions an alignment module 

(2) directly beneath the damaged tube and the module aligns 
the carousel. The carousel is rotated to sequentially 

align and register a laser welding module (3), a cleaning 
module (4), and an inspection module (5) with the damaged 

tube for a welding operation on a lower portion of the 
damaged tube in the tubesheet area. One embodiment for the 

alignment module has a pneumatically operated pin (2) which 
is operator controlled, and which has an increasing diameter 

from its distal end to obtain a gross to a vernier 
alignment of the carousel and, thus, a proper alignment for 

the remaining modules. A further embodiment provides an 
alignment pin which is automatically computer controlled 

without operator intervention. Limit switches and grooves 
are used as a logic checking device for the proper positioning 

of a respective module in the frame, and a pneumatically 
operated radial pin holds the module in the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method
for first aligning and then positioning several tools or
devices used in a welding operation for a lower portion of
a damaged heat exchange tube extending in a bore of a
tubesheet of a nuclear steam generator.Nuclear steam generators are comprised of three
principal parts, which are a primary side, a tubesheet in
which a bundle of U-shaped tubes are mounted, and a secondary
side. The tubesheet and U-shaped tubes hydraulically
isolate the primary and the secondary sides, while thermally
connecting them together so that heat from the radioactive
water in the primary side is transferred to the non-radioactive
water in the secondary side. This heat transfer
is accomplished by the U-shaped tubes mounted in the
tubesheet that extend throughout the secondary side of the
steam generator. The inlet and outlet ends of these U-shaped
tubes are mounted in the side of the tubesheet that
faces the primary side of the generator. The primary side
in turn includes a divider plate that hydraulically isolates
the inlet ends of the U-shaped tubes from the outlet
ends.Hot, radioactive water heated by the nuclear
reactor flows through the inlets in the tubesheet and
circulates around the U-shaped tubes that extend within the
secondary side of the steam generator. This hot, radioactive 
water transfers its heat through the walls of the U-shaped
tubes to the non-radioactive water that surrounds
the tubes in the secondary side of the generator, thereby
converting the water to non-reactive steam. After the
nuclear heated water circulates through the U-shaped tubes,
it flows back through the tubesheet, through the outlets of
the U-shaped tubes, where it is ultimately circulated back
to the nuclear reactor.The U-shaped tubes are supported by several
spaced-apart support plates and the inlet and outlet ends
extend through the tubesheet. Over long periods of time,
the heat exchanger tubes of such nuclear steam generators
can suffer a number of different types of corrosion degradation,
including intragranular stress corrosion cracking.
Tests have shown that even though corrosion cracking occurs
in the area of the tube supported in the support plates,
that most of this intragranular stress corrosion cracking
of the tubes occurs around the tubesheet region of the
generator where the inlet and outlet ends of the U-shaped
tubes extend through the bores in the tubesheet. These
conditions can result in the tube becoming defective such
that a leak occurs which not only creates an
