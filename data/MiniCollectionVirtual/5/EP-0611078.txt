<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for producing 
elastomeric compositions by forming a mixture of 

polymeric material, a reinforcing agent, a processing 
aid and a vulcanizing agent. The process of the 

invention is continuous and includes the repeated, 
sequential steps of admixing the polymeric material 

along a first mixing zone defined by a space wherein 
the gross energy applied induces a first operating 

temperature range. The mixture of the first zone is 
continuously passed into and through a second mixing 

zone while adding and admixing the reinforcement agent 
and processing aid therewith, the second mixing zone 

being defined by a space wherein the gross energy 
applied induces a second operating temperature range. 

The mixture of the second zone is then continuously 
passed into and through a third mixing zone while 

adding and admixing the vulcanizing agent therewith, 
the third mixing zone being defined by a space wherein 

the gross energy applied induces a third operating 
temperature range. The mixture of said third zone is 

the continuously passed into and through a delivery 
zone to extrude the mixture in the form of the 

elastomeric composition, with the second and third 
operating temperature ranges being lower than the first 

operating temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a process for
producing elastomeric compositions by mixing an
elastomeric material, a reinforcing agent, a processing
aid and a vulcanizing agent and to a twin-screw extruder
for mixing carbon black with rubber and of the type with
a pair of cylinders with feed ports for adding materials
to be mixed, a pair of extrusion screws positioned within
the cylinders and with elements for shearing, admixing,
moving and extruding materials through the extruder and
wherein the screws and cylinders define a plurality of
successively interconnected mixing zones of the extruder.The conversion of elastomeric compositions, and in
particular elastomeric polymers such as rubber, into
commercially significant materials has been a focal point
of the rubber industry throughout its history. The
earliest commercial process was largely based on a mixing
process utilizing two-roll mills to modify the basic
polymer's characteristics by adjusting the viscosity of
the polymer as well as by incorporating enhancing
ingredients such as reinforcing agents, modifying oils
and curatives. Over the years, a wide variety of mixing
processes and devices have evolved in the rubber
industry. A thorough treatment of such development is set
forth in an article entitled "Development of Internal-Mixer
Technology for the Rubber Industry" by James L.
White, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, Volume 65, page
528, the contents of which are specifically incorporated
herein by reference.The elastomer mixing process is basically defined as
combining the ingredients specified in an elastomeric 
recipe, on some schedule of addition, and under some
regime of mastications for a certain period of time
and/or temperature. Rubber elastomer mixing technology is
focused principally upon controlling five principal
features of the mixing process independent of the recipe
specifics. One feature of concern is the uniform
distribution of raw materials of the elastomer recipe
throughout a single unit mass or volume. The second
feature involves dispersive mixing which focuses on the
intimate association of the elastomer ingredients in a
physical sense, typically at a molecular level, which
influence the mechanical characteristics of the final
composition. The third feature involves viscosity
modification while the fourth feature is concerned with
chemical reactions of the ingredients. The final feature
involves, of course, economic considerations which
control capital utilization and manufacturing costs.
These five factors are
