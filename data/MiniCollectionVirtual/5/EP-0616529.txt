<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to parenteral preparations of antiestrogens such as toremifene, desmethyl toremifene, tamoxifen or desmethyltamoxifen. The preparations can be emulsions, liposomes or aqueous solutions of cyclodextrin-drug complexes. Particularly the invention relates to a parenteral drug formulation comprising a complex having a 2-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin component and including an active drug substance selected from the group consisting of toremifene, desmethyl toremifene, tamoxifen and desmethyltamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt thereof, said complex being present either in an aqueous solution or emulsion or loaded into a liposome.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drug formulations of antiestrogens, 
particularly antiestrogens comprising a triphenylbutene moiety, 
for use in parenteral administration. Toremifene, desmethyl toremifene, desmethyl tamoxifen and 
tamoxifen are all examples of substituted triphenylbutenes 
useful in cancer therapy. Reference is made to US 4696949, 
US 4990538 and US 4536516. They can all be described with 
the formula 
 
in which R1 is CH3 or H and R2 is H or Cl. The compounds mentioned above have the following values of 
R1 and R2; 
R1R2toremifeneCH3Cl desmethyl toremifeneHCl tamoxifenCH3H desmethyl tamoxifenHH A common feature of these antiestrogens is their poor 
solubility in water. Thus, parenteral administration of these 
drugs cannot be accomplished simply by an aqueous solution 
of the active ingredients. There is a clear need for parenteral formulations of the 
anticancer antiestrogens. Injectable high-concentration 
toremifene formulations will have important clinical benefit 
1) in the attempts to reach high concentrations in tissue. 
This is necessary especially when combinations of 
toremifene with cytotoxic drugs are given to a  
 
patient. As shown by DeGregorio et al (J Clinical 
Oncology, vol 7, No 9,1989: 1359 - 1364.) high plasma 
concentrations are more effective in reversing multidrug 
resistance than low concentrations. An injectable 
formulation enables high peak concentrations in blood 
and tissues without exposing the patient to long-term 
treatment; 2) when given locally into a tumor. This enables a high and 
efficacious concentration in the tumor to be achieved; 3) when used topically in a benign estrogen-dependent 
lesion like cystic mastalgia, where toremifene can be 
injected directly into a painful cyst; 4) when spreading toremifene topically onto palpable and 
subcutaneous breast cancer metastases; 5) when an intravesical installation is given for the therapy 
of superficial bladder cancer. In this indication 
toremifene may well be used together with other 
anticancer drugs to enhance their efficacy; 6) when an intraperitoneal solution is given for the 
treatment of certain types of overian cancer; 7) when other topical, estrogen-dependent lesions are 
treated with an antiestrogen. The parenteral drug formulations according to this invention 
include emulsions, aqueous solutions of cyclodextrin - drug 
complexes and liposomes. Dissolution properties of drugs can be significantly improved 
by complexation of the drug substance with cyclodextrins.
