<ABSTRACT>
A container for a liquid, viscous or pasty product has an applicator with a cap (22) having an outlet slot (32) which is engageable by a resilient extension flap (20) on one container wall, which flap is resiliently movable between an inoperative position in which it seals off the outlet slot (32) and an operative position in which it is clear of said slot.

<CLAIMS>
A container for a substance that is liquid, viscous, 
or semi-liquid, the container being provided with an 

applicator comprising an elastically deformable tongue 
(20, 52) having a free end designed to be applied against 

a surface on which the substance is to be deposited for 
the purpose of spreading the substance on said surface, 

said tongue being disposed inside an outlet opening (32) 
for the substance and being displaceable by elastic 

deformation from a rest position in which it closes said 
opening to a working position in which it opens a portion 

of said opening and enables the substance to escape, the 
rest position of the tongue being defined positively by 

the tongue bearing against a first fixed abutment , the 
container being characterized in that said opening (32) 

is a slot and in that said working position of the tongue 
is defined positively by the tongue bearing against a 

second fixed abutment. 
A container according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said abutments are the edges of the outlet slot (32) 

for the substance. 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the tongue (20) is integrally molded with the 

container (10). 
A container according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the tongue extends from the edge (18) of an open end 

of the container (10) inside a cap (22) mounted on said 
open end of the container, and having the outlet slot 

(32) for the substance, with the end of the tongue going 
through the slot. 
A container according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the outlet slot (32) of the cap is defined by two 

opposite walls (26, 28) of the cap, the tongue (20)  
 

pressing in sealed manner against the walls when in its 
rest position. 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the tongue (52) is integrally molded with a 

closure piece (42) for the open end of the container 
(10), and when in its rest position it presses against an 

edge (54) of said opening, and when in its working 
position it pr
esses against a fixed abutment of said 
closure piece (42). 
A container according to claim 6, characterized in 
that said closure piece (42) comprises two elastically 

deformable tongues (52) of the above-specified type which 
are connected to each other in a V-shape or a W-shape, 

and two abutments (56) defining the working positions of 
the two tongues. 
A container according to claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that said closure piece (42) is mounted on the open 

end of the container (10) by resilient snap-fastening. 
A container according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the closure piece (42) comprises a fixed central 

portion (46) whose two opposite ends are provided with 
projections (48, 50) engaging in grooves (38) in two 

opposite walls (14) of the container (10), thereby 
holding said piece (42) in position and preventing it 

from rotating relative to the container. 
A container according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the, or each, above-mentioned abutment (56) is 

formed on the fixed central portion (46) of the closure 
piece (42).
