<ABSTRACT>
Sequence-specific oligonucleotides are provided having substantially pure chiral Sp phosphorothioate, chiral Rp phosphorothioate, chiral Sp alkylphosphonate, chiral Rp alkylphosphonate, chiral Sp phosphoamidate, chiral Rp phosphoamidate, chiral Sp phosphotriester, and chiral Rp phosphotriester linkages. The novel oligonucleotides are prepared via a stereospecific SN2 nucleophilic attack of a phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphoramidate, phosphotriester or alkylphosphonate anion on the 3' position of a xylonucleotide. The reaction proceeds via inversion at the 3' position of the xylo reactant species, resulting in the incorporation of phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphoramidate, phosphotriester or alkylphosphonate linked ribofuranosyl sugar moieties into the oligonucleotide. Alternatively, enzymatic methods are used to prepare oligonucleotides having chirally pure phophorus inter-sugar linkages. Therapeutic and diagnostic methods using the same are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
Portions of this application may have been supported
by National Institute of Health Grant No. GM45061.This invention is directed to sequence-specific
oligonucleotides having chiral phosphorus,linkages and to a
novel enzymatic and chemical synthesis of these and other
oligonucleotides. The invention includes chiral alkylphosphonate,
chiral phosphotriester, chiral phosphorothioates, and
chiral phosphoramidate-linked oligonucleotides. The invention 
further includes chiral phosphorothioate, chiral alkylphosphonate,
chiral phosphotriester, and chiral phosphoramidate-linked
oligonucleotides that contain at least one modified
nucleoside unit. The novel chemical synthesis provides such
chiral phosphorothioate, chiral alkylphosphonate, chiral
phosphotriester, and chiral phosphoramidate oligonucleotides
as well as "natural" or "wild type" phosphodiester oligonucleotides.Messenger RNA (mRNA) directs protein synthesis. As a
therapeutic strategy, antisense therapy strives to disrupt the
synthesis of target proteins by using a sequence-specific
oligonucleotide to form a stable heteroduplex with its
corresponding mRNA. Such antisense oligonucleotides generally
have been natural phosphodiester oligonucleotides.As contrasted to natural phosphodiester oligonucleotides,
the use of phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate,
phosphotriester or phosphoramidate oligonucleotides in
antisense therapy provides certain distinguishing features.
Each of the phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate,
phosphotriester or phosphoramidate phosphorus linkages can
exist as diastereomers. Certain of these phosphorothioate,
methylphosphonate, phosphotriester or phosphoramidate
oligonucleotides have a greater resistance to nucleases. Some
have solubilities similar to the solubility of natural
phosphodiester oligonucleotides. Other have solubilities 
different from that of the natural phosphodiester
oligonucleotides. Some are generally more chemically or
thermodynamically stable than the natural phosphodiester
oligonucleotides. At least the phosphorothioates have oligonucleotide-RNA
heteroduplexes that can serve as substrates for
endogenous RNase H.The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, like the natural
phosphodiester oligonucleotides, are soluble in aqueous media.
In contrast, methylphosphonate, phosphotriester, and phosphoramidate
oligonucleotides, which lack a charge on the
phosphorus group, can penetrate cell membranes to a greater
extent and, thus, facilitate cellular uptake. The
internucleotide linkage in methylphosphonate oligonucleotides
is
