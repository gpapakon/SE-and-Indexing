<ABSTRACT>
A portable garbage can comprises a cylindrical 
can body (2), an annular cap receiver (3) combined with 

the can body, two half caps (4, 4') swingably combined 
with the cap receiver, and an inverted L-shaped handle 

(5) combined with the cap receiver and having a bottom 
square engage portion (51) inserted in an inner recess 

of a square plate (30) fixed on one side of the cap 
receiver, two opposite saw teeth (521, 522) provided in 

the inner opening (522) of the square engage portion to 
engage and rotate a stationary tooth (40, 40') 

respectively fixed on one side of the two half caps to 
swing open or close an upper opening of the cap receiver 

combined with the can body for throwing garbage therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a portable garbage can. A known garbage can shown in Fig. 1 comprises a 
can body 10, a stationary half cap 11 formed on the can 
body and a movable half cap 12 to close a half opening. 
When garbage is to be thrown in the can, the half cap is 
opened by hand. Then the half cap is pulled shut by 
hand. However, the opening is not sufficiently large to 
collect thrown garbage, so garbage may often touch or 
bump against the half cap 11 or the upper curved edge of 
the can body 10. In addition, the half cap 12 may 
easily become smeared by hand as it is opened and 
closed, and the can has no suitable means for carrying 
or lifting it up, so it is not convenient for moving. 
Furthermore, the can body may fall over by accident, 
with the garbage accumulated therein being scattered 
around it. An object of this invention is to provide a 
portable garbage can that avoids one or more of the 
above-mentioned disadvantages. This invention has been devised to offer a  
 
portable garbage can having the following advantages. 
1. It has two half caps to open or close up an 
upper wide open side of a cap receiver provided on a 
cylindrical can body so that garbage can be easily 
thrown into the can body. 2. It has a handle for pulled up to open the two 
half caps without using the hand to contact directly 
the caps, so that a user's hand cannot be smeared, or 
the caps are not smeared with garbage. 3. It has a carrying handle. 4. It has a cap receiver and a cylindrical can 
body combined together with stability so that it cannot 
easily fall over with the garbage therein being 
scattered around. 5. The can body and the cap receiver are easily 
assembled together or taken apart, facilitating washing 
of the can. This invention will now be further described, by 
way of example only, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a conventional 
garbage can; Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of a 
portable garbage can of the present invention; Figure 3 is a perspective view of an assembled  
 
portable garbage can of the present invention; Figure 4 is a perspective view of the portable 
garbage can of Figures 2 and 3, with two half caps 
opened; and Figure 5 is a perspective view of the portable 
garbage can of Figures 2 and 3 with two half caps 
closed. A portable garbage can of the present invention, 
as shown in Fig. 2, comprises a cylindrical can body 2, 
an annular cap receiver 3, two swingable half caps 4, 
4' and a handle 5 as main
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A portable garbage can comprising; 
   a cylindrical can body (2) having a closed 

bottom, an open top, and two opposed stop projections 
(20, 21) on the top end; 

   an annular cap receiver (3) hooked on the open 
top of said cylindrical can body, having an open top, 

two opposite swelled-to-the-middle upper edges, a square 
plate (30) at one side, said square plate having an 

inner recess (31) for receiving a square engage portion 
(51) of a handle (5) therein and a vertical hole (32) in 

an inside bottom end, two engage holes (33) on the 
opposite side to the square plate, two opposed hooks 

(34, 35) on a bottom edge for hooking said stop 
projections of said cylindrical body can to combine the 

cap receiver with said can body; 
   two half caps (4, 4') pivotally combined with 

said cap receiver, respectively having a curved shape of 
the same size, a stationary tooth (40, 40') on one side 

and a round projection (41, 41') on the opposite side; 
   a handle (5) of an inverted L shape, having an 

upper horizontal portion (50) being corrugated for 
gripping, a square engage portion (51) formed at a 

bottom end and inserted in said inside recess of said 
square plate of said cap receiver, said square engage 

 
portion having two vertical opposite saw teeth (521, 

522) on two opposite inner vertical sides to engage said 
two stationary teeth of said two half caps, and a round 

projection (523) extending down from the bottom of said 
square engage portion; 

   a coil spring (6) provided to fit around said 
round projection of said handle and resting on a bottom 

inner edge of said square plate; and 
   said two half caps being in a closed position 

(the original position) when said handle is not pressed 
down and pushed up by said coil spring, with the upper 

portions of said two saw teeth engaging said stationary 
teeth of said half caps, said half caps being in an open 

position for garbage to be thrown in said can body 
through said cap receiver when said handle is pressed 

down by hand to compress said coil spring, with said 
square engage portion moving up to rotate said two 

stationary teeth of said half caps, forcing said half 
caps swing outward, said two half caps being 

automatically moved to the original position, ie the 
closed position, in case the handle is released to be 

moved up by elasticity of said coil spring, said handle 
possible to be caught with hand to move this whole can 

by hooking the cap received with the can body without 
the garbage therein falling out to scatter around.
