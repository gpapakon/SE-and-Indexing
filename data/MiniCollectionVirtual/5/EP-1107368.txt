<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for mounting a connector assembly (28) to a
substrate (34). The substrate includes at least one pre-placement hole (76) and at least

one positioning hole (78). A connector housing (72) has a pre-placement peg (82) sized
for insertion into the pre-placement hole (76) in the substrate with substantially zero

insertion forces to generally place the housing on the substrate. The housing has a
positioning peg (84) sized for insertion into the positioning hole (78) in the substrate by

a press-fit to precisely fix the housing on the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of connector assemblies, such as electrical connectors, fiber optic connectors and the like, and particularly to a system for mounting a connector assembly to a substrate, such as a printed circuit board.Fiber optic connectors of a wide variety of designs have been employed to terminate optical fiber cables and to facilitate connection of the cables to other cables or other optical fiber transmission devices. A typical fiber optic connector known in the art includes a ferrule which mounts and centers an optical fiber or fibers within the connector. The ferrule may be fabricated of such material as ceramic. A ferrule holder or other housing component of the connector embraces the ferrule and may be fabricated of such material as molded plastic. A spring may be disposed within the housing or ferrule holder such that the ferrule is yieldably biased forwardly for engaging another fiber-mounting ferrule of a mating connecting device.A pair of fiber optic connectors or a connector and another optical fiber transmission device often are mated in an adapter known in the art which centers the fibers to provide low insertion losses. The adapter couples the connectors together so that their encapsulated fibers connect end-to-end. The adapter may be an in-line component, or the adapter can be designed for mounting in an opening in a panel, backplane, circuit board or the like.WO 93/08619 describes a connector of the type that has pegs for insertion in holes of a circuit board to securly hold the connector to the board. Each peg has a plurality of ribs projecing outwardly from the periphery of the peg body. The pegs are constructed of material of lowerhardness than the material of the circuit board, so the interference fit between the pegs and circuit board results in flattening of the of the tips and/or shaving of the tips of the ribs.Various problems continue to be encountered in designing fiber optic connector assemblies or other connector assemblies, including applications involving backplanes, motherboards, daughterboards and the like. Such problems include properly and precisely placing a connector assembly on a substrate, such as a printed circuit board, accommodating misalignment of the connectors during mating, allowing relative floating movement between various components of the system and similar positional-type problems. Other problems simply involve efforts to simplify the design of connector assemblies. The present invention is directed to solving these
