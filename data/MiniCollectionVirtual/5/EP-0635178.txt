<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for avoiding self-oscillation in a four-wire loop in conjunction with echo cancellation effected with the aid of an adaptive filter (15). Self-oscillation is avoided for both long and short connections and also when signaling with narrow-band signals, by restricting the permitted range of the coefficients of the adaptive filter in a manner such that the absolute value of the filter transfer function will be sufficiently small for amplication in the four-wire loop to be less than one. This is achieved by limiting the absolute value of the filter transfer function ¦Hca¦, to a value which is smaller than a determined function of the echo transfer function (Hfa) in the far-end (13) of the loop and the echo transfer function Hne in the near-end (14) of the loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for avoiding self-oscillation
in a four-wire loop in conjunction with echo cancellation
effected with the aid of an adaptive filter.In telecommunication systems in which adaptive echo cancellation
is effected with the aid of an adaptive filter in a four-wire loop,
in certain operational cases problems occur with self-oscillation,
so-called "bursting". This phenomenon is caused by the presence in
the four-wire loop of a feedback from the output of the adaptive
filter to its input, via the far-end of the loop. In this way, a
near-end signal is able to pass around the loop and appear as a
far-end signal at the filter input and thereby influence the
setting of the adaptive filter. The risk of self-oscillation is
greater in the case of shorter connections, for instance when so-called
adaptive hybrids are used, than in the case of longer
connections, for instance when so-called trunk echo cancelers are
used. This is because the near-end signal passing around the loop
is decorrelated as a result of the large delay that occurs in long
connections.The "bursting" phenomenon and a method of reducing the risk of
"bursting", i.e. self-oscillation, is described in W.A. Sethares,
C.R. Johnson JR. and C.E. Rohrs: "Bursting in Adaptive Hybrids",
IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. 37, No. 8, August 1989,
pages 791-799.According to the known method there is used a so-called double-talk
detector and the updating of an adaptive filter used for echo
cancellation is interrupted when signals from a near-end are
detected. The method can be relatively successful in the case of
trunk echo cancelers which are localized in a network so that the 
echo path will be relatively heavily attenuated, e.g. more than 6
dB. However, attenuation of the echo is poorer in the case of an
adaptive hybrid which lies in the actual 2/4-wire transition, and
consequently the detector has a more difficult task. Furthermore,
there is a risk that any self-oscillation will be interpreted as
a strong near-end signal, causing updating to be interrupted. In
this case, any self-oscillation that had commenced would become
permanent, which is unacceptable.It has also been found that when the signals are narrow band
signals, e.g. when they are comprised of pure tones, a weak near-end
signal may also have a pronounced disturbing effect on the
adaptive filter, and therewith result in self-oscillation. Tone
signalling is found, for instance, in modem traffic. Consequently,
when applying the known method there is a
