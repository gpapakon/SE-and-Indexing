 APPLICATION FOR PATENTTITLE: MEDICATION INJECTION DEVICESPECIFICATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a medication injection device which, upon being activated by the user, delivers medication from a syringe with needle to the user with the needle being in a retracted, hidden position at all times except when actual injection occurs. More particularly, .this device permits treatment of appropriate cases of male erectile dysfunction by accurate placement and introduction of substances into the erectile bodies (corpora cavernosa) of the penis.2. Description of the Related ArtIt is well known that many persons are apprehensive of receiving an injection from a hypodermic needle. This situation is worsened for those who must administer their own injections, such as diabetic patients and others who regularly require medication or who require that medication be administered in private or in emergency situations, such as acute allergies to insect bites (anaphylaxis) , hypoglycemic reactions, etc. This apprehension is particularly acute in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction with direct injection of medication into the penis. 

 While the invention is intended to be used in conjunction with the administration of medicine of any physical form to various parts of the body and to various tissue depths, it is particularly applicable for use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.Defined simply, erectile dysfunction occurs when a male is unable to maintain adequate penile rigidity necessary to initiate, sustain and successfully consummate the act of coitus. It denotes organic impotence.This condition can be a psychologically devastating therapeutic problem. It has been estimated to effect 50% of all diabetic men and up to 9% of younger men in apparent good health. Varying degrees of erectile dysfunction caused by age, drug use, arteriosclerosis, trauma, hormone disorders and surgical procedures have also been observed. Diminished male erectile response is the limiting factor in sexual relationships. The fear of erectile failure has been reported as one of the primary reasons for decreased libido in older males.The penile erection mechanism of the normal male is a complex interaction of hormones, neurotransmitters and blood vessels. An erection begins when paired penile arteries dilate in response to neurotransmitters relaxing the smooth muscle walls of the arteries. An increased incoming blood flow engorges the chambers of the penis (corpora cavernosa) where it
