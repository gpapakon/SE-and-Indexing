<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel dye for an image
forming dye usable in an image forming method using a heat
sensitive transfer material, a photographic light sensitive
material or an ink jet image forming material. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a dye improved
in image preservability and absorption characteristics and a
heat sensitive transfer material using the dye.As a simple dry process for obtaining images,
particularly full color images, there is known a method which
uses a heat sensitive transfer material. In such a heat
sensitive material, a dye used to form color images is of
especial importance, and there have been proposed a variety of
dyes for this purpose. The dye for color image formation is
required to have good absorption characteristics including a 
sharp spectral absorption less in secondary absorption and a
high spectral absorption coefficient as well as high
stabilities to heat and light. Further, it is also important
that the dye can be easily synthesized and readily dissolved
in a solvent. Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. No. 63194/1989
proposes a heat transfer material which uses a specific
magenta dye. The heat sensitive transfer material which uses
the dye disclosed in the above patent can form images of good
hue and, further, has a high sensitivity because the dye
itself has a high molar absorption coefficient, so that the
pending problems of heat sensitive image transfer can be
solved in those respects. However, it has a defect that the
light fastness of images is considerably low. With the object
of eliminating the defect in light fastness, Japanese Pat.
O.P.I. Pub. No. 178646/1992 proposes a pyrazoloazole
azomethine dye having a specific atomic group in its dye
structure and a heat sensitive transfer material using the
dye. However, the dye disclosed in said patent has
disadvantages that its synthesis needs a complicated procedure
and that when used in a heat sensitive material, it lowers the
sensitivity because of its large molecular weight due to an
atomic group introduced into it. EP-A-0 512 548 discloses a pyridine derivative represented by the
following formula A or B, a dye produced by coupling the pyridine
derivative A or B with an arbitrary coupler and a thermal
transfer sheet wherein use is made of the dye. In a thermal
transfer process wherein use is made of a sublimable dye, the dye
and the thermal transfer sheet according to EP-A-0 512 548 can
form an image.
