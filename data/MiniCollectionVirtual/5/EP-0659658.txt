<ABSTRACT>
For the reliable separation and hygienic removal of stored articles, in particular hygiene articles, the storage container has a separating and delivery device which can be actuated mechanically, can be returned automatically to the starting position and is formed by a double slide which is movable at right angles to the vertical axis of the storage container. This double slide is arranged at the lower end of the storage container and has two surfaces which run parallel to one another spaced apart and whose spacing is greater than the diameter of the article to be delivered.

Receptacle container with a receiving shaft (3) for articles to be 
singled, in particular hygiene articles, wherein the receiving shaft 

opens into a singling channel with a singling and discharge device, 
which is associated therewith and automatically returnable into the 

initial position, and the singling and discharge device is formed by a 
double slide (1) consisting of a discharge slide (1''), which is 

provided with a discharge slot (5), as well as of a singling plate 
(1'), which is connected therewith and arranged parallelly at a 

spacing, characterised thereby, that the singling plate (1') is formed 
as an element, which stiff in bending and juts out freely from a 

terminating end plate (2), and the singling plate (1') as well as the 
discharge slide (1'') are guided in openings in the vertical walls of 

the singling channel constructed to be closed laterally, wherein the 
double slide (1) is actuable by way of the terminating end plate (2) by 

means of an actuating element (10) hinged at the receptacle container. 
Receptacle container according to claim 1, characterised thereby, 
that an opening (9), which is provided in the upper region of its front 

side (7), for the laying of the articles into the receiving shaft (3) 
is associated with a frontal pivotable cover (10), which covers the 

opening (9) and a viewing window provided in the front side (7) as well 
as also the terminating end plate (2) and is formed at the same time as 

actuating element for the double slide (1). 
Receptacle container according to claim 2, characterised thereby, 
that the pivotable cover (10) is formed to be angled and the angled-away 

part is hinged at the upper end face (11) of the receptacle 
container. 
Receptacle container according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby, that the double slide (1) is arranged at the 

lower end of the receptacle container.  
 
Receptacle container according to claim 1, characterised thereby, 
that a compression spring is provided underneath the stored articles 

and urges these upwardly and the double slide (1) is arranged at the 
upper end of the receptacle container, wherein the singling plate (1') 

lies above the discharge slide (1''). 
Receptacle container according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised thereby, that the spacing of the mutually parallelly 

extending surfaces of the singling plate (1') and of the discharge 
slide (1'') is greater than the diameter of the article to be 

discharged.
