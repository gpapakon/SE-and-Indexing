<ABSTRACT>
The output of the semiconductor control module 1 is connected to the horn (audible warning device) 2, whereas the input of the control module 1 is connected to a conventional horn control 3, for operation in horn mode, to an alarm control 4 via a frequency-control circuit 5 for operation in alarm mode, and to a short-pulse generator 6 for operation in sound-effect mode. In order to avoid breaker noise when turning the pulse generator on and off, it is connected to a pulse-modulation circuit. The invention makes it possible to obtain, with a conventional horn, the functions of horn, alarm and sound-effect generator.

Multiple function control module for audible alarms for
motor vehicles of the type comprising a membrane and a

normally closed contact of which the contacts are closed at
rest, said membrane being actuated by an electromagnetic coil

controlled by said normally closed contact, comprising a
semiconductor component (1) of which the output is connected

to the audible alarm (2) and of which the input is connected,
on the one hand, to a d.c. supply for operation in alarm mode

and, on the other hand, to a generator of short pulses (6) for
operating as an acoustic device, the duration of said short

pulses thus being sufficiently small not to cause the opening
of the contacts of the normally closed contact of said audible

alarm.
Control module according to claim 1, characterised in
that the input of the semiconductor component (1) is also

connected to a d.c. supply via a timing circuit (5) for
operation as an alarm.
Control module according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that the pulse generator (6) is connected to

a circuit for modulating the duration of the pulses so the
pulses applied to the input of the semiconductor component (1)

have an increasing and/or decreasing width.
Control module according to claim 3, characterised in
that the width of the control pulses increases and/or

decreases between about 0 and 500 microseconds.
Control module according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the timing circuit (5) is connected to

the input of the pulse generator (6).
