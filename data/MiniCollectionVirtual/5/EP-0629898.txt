<ABSTRACT>
A lens-fitted photo film unit includes 
a housing (2,22,23,35a-c,42) which 

incorporates an exposure mechanism (5,6) and is pre-loaded with 
photo film. A packaging cardboard (3,34) covers the housing. An 

identification sign (8,24,26,48,50,301-303) is disposed outside 
the housing in externally 

readable fashion, and signals information of one kind 
of the housing. In classification of the photo film unit, 

the packaging cardboard is removed from the housing. The 
identification sign (8,24,26,48,50,301-303) is read, 

to detect the one kind of the 
housing. Three downstream paths (38a-c) are disposed and respectively 

associated with three kinds of housings. The housing is 
transferred to one of the downstream paths in association 

with the detected one kind. In a preferred embodiment, the 
identification sign includes a combination of smooth and 

rough faces, which are different in optical reflectance from 
one another. The combination constitutes the information of 

the one kind of the housing. Preferably, a lower critical 
value is determined for a surface roughness of the rough 

face. A lower critical ratio in surface roughness is determined 
between the smooth and rough faces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lens-fitted photo film unit and an apparatus for
classifying plural kinds of a lens-fitted photo film unit and a method of classifying plural
kinds of a lens-fitted photo film unit.More particularly, the present invention relates to an improvement
in which plural kinds of lens-fitted photo film
units can be classified with great ease.A known lens-fitted photo film unit (hereinafter referred
to simply as photo film unit) is disclosed in JP-U
(Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No.) 1-128241
for example, and is now on the market, e.g. under the trade
name "Fujicolor Quick Snap +3" (manufactured by Fuji Photo
Film Co., Ltd.). Such photo film units are a single-use
camera pre-loaded with photo filmstrip (hereinafter referred
to as photo film). The photo film unit is sold at a low
price as compared with a conventional camera. When a user
purchases the photo film unit, he can carry it with him with
great portability, and take photographs whenever he desires.
There have been a number of different variants of commercially
available photo film units, such as a flash built-in type 
"Fujicolor Quick Snap Flash" for exposures at night or in a
room, a panoramic type "Fujicolor Quick Snap Panoramic" for
exposures like wide-angle photography, and a waterproof type
"Fujicolor Quick Snap Waterproof" provided with a watertight
case for underwater exposures.A user of the photo film unit winds the photo film frame
by frame back into a cassette after each exposure. When the
entirety of the photo film is exposed, the exposed photo film
with the cassette is unloaded from the photo film unit.
While the photo film is developed, the emptied photo film
unit is discarded as waste. However, the huge amount of
collectively created waste is a social problem in the environmental
point of view. To reduce such waste, photo film
units emptied of photo films are to be recycled.In the recycling of photo film housings of the photo
film units, the housings are classified into respective
particular models, and then subjected to inspection of performance
of taking exposures in view of reuse for photography.
The used housings detected as acceptable are reloaded
with new photo films, and packaged to be shipped newly as
merchandise.The above-mentioned plural variants of photo film units
are collectively withdrawn by a manufacturer. It is general
in a factory that operators manually classify the housings
into the respective particular models. However, there is a
problem in manual classification of photo
