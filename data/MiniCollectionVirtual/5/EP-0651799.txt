<DESCRIPTION>
Endothelial injury is believed to be an initial step in thrombus
formation and may be caused by, e.g., hemodynamic strain,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and immune complex disease.
Endothelial injury leads to thickening of the intima, cell
proliferation, cholesterol accumulation, and formation of
connective tissue fibers. IgG and complement factor C3
accumulation in injured endothelial cells and nonendothelialized
intima has been observed. Mononuclear cells derived from blood are
also part of the cell population in atherosclerotic lesions. The
mechanism of plaque formation is not fully known. However, a
probable mechanism is that the earliest lesions, fatty streaks,
consisting of mixtures of T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages,
form in the subendothelium followed by a secretion of various
cytokines, which leads to a migration of smooth cells into the
intima and their accumulation therein. Most existing procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of
atherosclerosis and thrombosis are invasive, costly, and of
limited effectiveness in a significant percentage of patient
cases.The concept of plaque enhancement by application of a stain
has been reported [Spears, J. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 71:
395-399 (1983)]. These stains mark the plaque surfaces with
a fluorescent compound. Plaque destruction by
photoactivation of hematoporphyrin derivatives using an
intraluminal laser-transmitting optical fiber has been
suggested [Abela, G. et al., Am. J. Cardiol. 50: 1199-1205
(1982)]. Moreover, tetracycline stains have also been
suggested. [Murphy-Chutorian, D. et al., Am. J. Cardiol.
55: 1293-1297 (1985)].The above-identified stains were selected for their ability
to bind to components of the atherosclerotic plaque. In
principle, the stain absorbs laser light concentrating the
light at the stained surface. Some staining of healthy
tissue occurs causing stain associated damage to the
surrounding tissue. Because laser light wavelength is
limited to the absorption wavelength of the stain,
chromophores offering optimum absorption of laser light must
be used to provide best controlled ablation.Imaging and detection of coronary thrombi, pulmonary emboli,
deep venous thrombosis and atherosclerotic lesions are of
great clinical importance especially in view of the new
thrombolytic agents which have recently been developed.
Several experimental approaches for non-invasive detection
of thrombi by use of radiopharmaceutical agents have been
reported but none has gained wide clinical recognition
because of intrinsic
