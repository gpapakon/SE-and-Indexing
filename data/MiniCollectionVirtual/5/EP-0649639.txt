<ABSTRACT>
To substitute for a missing bone part, in particular for the greater trochanter, the implant (3) comprises an attachment body (6) which can be positioned laterally of the shaft (2) of the associated prosthesis and has the shape of a flange-like shield for muscles and ligaments to be fastened thereon, as well as a sleeve (7) which can be fitted on the shaft (2) and is divided into two sleeve members (7a and 7b) that can be attached to the sides of the shaft (2) and can be connected with one another. The attachment body (6) is also divided into two attachment members (6a and 6b) which can rest against each other, are each joined to one of the sleeve members (7a and 7b, respectively) to form a building unit (3a and 3b, respectively) and are releasably connected to one another via screws (12a and 12b) arranged between the shaft (2) and the attachment members (6a and 6b). The implant (3) can be fitted on the shaft (2) from a side that is readily accessible by the surgeon, and it can be exchanged in a correspondingly simple manner.

<CLAIMS>
An implant (3) associated with a shaft (2) of an endoprosthesis,
in particular of a prosthesis for the head

of a femur, as a replacement for a missing bone portion,
in particular the large trochanter, comprises an

attachment body (6) which is formed corresponding to
this bone portion, which is positionable to the side

of the shaft (2), which is provided with openings for
the securing of muscles and ligaments attached

thereto, and which is connected to a yoke (7) mountable
onto and surrounding a longitudinal section (2b)

of the shaft (2), characterized in that at least the
yoke (7) is subdivided into two parts (7a and 7b)

which can be placed on both sides of the shaft (2),
which are connectable to one another, and which are

executed with support surfaces (16a, 16b) which can be
brought into contact with one another and can be

braced against one another via releasable fastening
means (12a, 12b).
Implant in accordance with claim 1, characterized in
that the attachment body (6) is implemented in the

form of a flange-like shield disposed at a distance
from the shaft (2) and connected to at least one of

the yoke parts (7a, 7b) via an adjoining web-like carrier
portion (10).
Implant in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the attachment body (6) is subdivided into two

attachment parts (6a and 6b) which can be brought into
contact with each other and separated from one another,

each of which is connected to a respective yoke
part (7a, 7b respectively) to form a respective constructional

unit (3a, 3b respectively) and can be coupled 
to one another via the fastening means (12a,

12b).
Implant in accordance with claim 3, characterized in
that the attachment parts (6a and 6b) cooperate via

support surfaces (11a and 11b) which lie in a common
plane (E) with the support surfaces (16a and 16b) of

the yoke parts (7a and 7b), for example in a common
plane (E) which can be aligned with respect to a longitudinal

axis (L, H) of the shaft (12).
Implant in accordance with one of the claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the attachment body (6) is implemented

with at least two apertures (20a and 20b)
which are arranged on either side of the carrier portion

(10), which each extend over a continuous inner
areal region of the shield, and which are bounded outwardly

by frame-like peripheral regions of the shield.
Implant in accordance with one of the claims 2 or 5,
characterized in that the shield is implemented with a

domed attachment surface (6c, 6d) for the muscles and
ligaments, which is formed by a curvature in the longitudinal

direction extending along the longitudinal
extent of the shaft (2), and a curvature in the transverse

direction superimposed thereon.
Implant in accordance with claim 6, characterized in
that the curvature of the attachment surface (6c, 6d)

in the longitudinal direction is specified by a first
radius of curvature (R3), which is, at least approximately,

centred on a point (P) in the region of the
longitudinal axis (H) of the shaft (2), and in that

the curvature in the transverse direction is specified
by a second radius of curvature (R4) which is smaller

than the first radius of curvature (R3). 
Implant in accordance with one of the claims 2 to 7,
characterized in that the shield is formed with an

oval outer contour.
Implant in accordance with on of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the yoke parts (7a and 7b) on

the side remote from the attachment body (6) are provided
with interlockable end portions (15a and 15b),

which can be braced against one another, and are provided
with means (18) for attachment of the fastening

means (12a, 12b) on the side adjacent to the attachment
body (6).
Implant in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least one of the yoke

parts (7a and 7b) is implemented with a spigot-like
centring part (13) projecting inwardly into its hollow

cavity (8) and provided for insertion into a receiving
bore (14) of the shaft (2).
Endoprosthesis with an implant in accordance with one
of the claims 1 to 10.
Endoprosthesis in accordance with claim 11, the shaft
(2) of which comprises a shaft body (2a) insertable in

the direction of a longitudinal axis (L) into a tubular
bone, and a neck portion (2c) which is inclined at

an angle (Î±) relative to the longitudinal axis (L),
characterized in that the shaft body (2a) is implemented

in its proximal region, which is provided for
the receipt of the implant (3), with a curved longitudinal

section (2b) which merges into the neck portion
(2c).
