<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a bar assembly for use in 
frames,constituted by two rigidly associated 

section parts, comprising a first rectangular-section 
part (10), destined to be in an internal 

environment, constituting the basic body (11) of 
the section, and a second part (20), destined to 

be in an external environment, being a closure and 
completion element of the exterior form of the 

assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises an assembly constituted by 
two rigidly associated section bars, wherein one 
rectangular-section part, destined to be in an 
internal environment, provides the basic body of 
the section and defines a closed chamber on its 
longer sides, externally of which are 
protuberances and projections functioning as 
connectors with other parts, as well as with 
gaskets or anchoring and manoeuvring accessories 
of the frame, and a second part, destined to be in 
an external environment, being a closure and 
completion element of the exterior form of the 
assembly. The field of metal frames, in particular aluminium 
frames, comprises numerous series of differently-structured 
and conformed sections relating to 
frames of various types and with various 
functions. One frequent problem in frame manufacture consists 
in the necessity of having to use different  
 
colours for the inside of the frame and for the 
outside of the frame. This necessity derives from civic norms insisting 
that certain colours be used externally, 
especially on the outsides of buildings of 
historic or architectural value, whereas a more 
modern internal decor might require other tones. For example, where wood or wood-imitating colours 
must be used, the aluminium or like frames are 
coated in those colours, while the same colours 
inside the building may not be at all to the taste 
of the user. Aluminium sections, as is known, are coloured by 
means of anodization or by directly painting the 
bars destined to be cut and mounted in the 
construction of the frame. It is almost 
impossible, or at least prohibitively expensive if 
not technically impossible, to take into serious 
consideration a solution where the surfaces 
destined for the outside and the inside of bars 
are in different colours. One possible solution, however, offered by 
section bars manufactured in such a way that there 
are two parts, a base destined to face the inside, 
and a second part facing the outside environment.  
 The second part is shaped such as to close and 
complete the first part, the parts being coupled 
by an interposition of synthetic wedges preventing 
them from actually touching each other. Functionally this kind of distancing is directed 
(and often combined with double-glazing) at 
limiting heat transfer through the entire frame: 
it leads, however, to considerable constructional 
complexity, with consequent high costs. Dual 
colour frames can be obtained with the above 
series of sectioned parts, obviously by choosing 
differ

<CLAIMS>
A metal assembly adapted to form section bars for 
frames, comprising a first rectangular-section 

part (10), destined to be in an internal 
environment, providing the basic body (11) of the 

section and defining a closed chamber (12) with 
longer sides and smaller sides (40, 30) the longer 

sides having external protuberances (13) and 
projections (14) functioning as connectors with 

other parts, as well as with gaskets or anchoring 
and manoeuvring accessories of the frame, and a 

second, flat, part (20), destined to be in an 
external environment, being a closure and 

completion element of the exterior form of the 
assembly characterised in that
 
the second part (20) is connected to the first 

part (10) by means for coupling comprising, on the 
said second part (20), two longitudinal wings of 

L-shaped cross-section (21, 22) projecting from a 
same side (30) of said second part (20) but facing 

opposite directions and being of different 
heights; a shorter wing (21) having a cross-section 

terminating in a hook (23)  
 

turned back towards a surface of the side (30) of 
the second part (20), a taller wing (22), the cross-section 

of which after an initial right-angled 
bend directed towards the shorter wing (21), turns 

back in a squared C-shaped tract(24) in an 
opposite direction to the initial bend, terminates 

in a semicircular projection (25) facing away from 
the side (30) of the second part (20); and also 

comprising,on the first part (10), two roughly C-shaped 
seats (15, 16), developing in a 

longitudinal direction on a smaller side (40) of 
the first part (10), a first seat (15) facing in a 

parallel direction to a development direction of 
said smaller side (40) of the first part (10) and 

terminating in a hook projection (17) turned back 
towards said smaller side (40);and a second seat 

(16) facing in a same direction as the first seat 
(15), being located at an opposite end of the 

smaller side (40) to the first seat (15);the 
second seat (16) engaging the squared C-shape 

tract(24) of the taller wing (22) by pressure of 
the semicircular projection (25) against a surface 

of the smaller side (40) following a partial 
rotation of the second part (20) with respect to 

the first part (10); said rotation also  
 

determining an insertion of the shorter wing (21) 
in the first seat (15) and a reciprocal hooking-up 

of the hook-projections (17, 23) of the shorter 
wing (21) and first seat (15), and defining a 

longitudinal throat (50) between the shorter wing 
(21) and an external surface of the smaller side 

(40); a longitudinal insert (60) being pressure-inserted 
in the longitudinal throat (50) and 

determining a rigid fixing of the shorter wing 
(21) in the first seat (15) and the taller wing 

(22) in the second seat (16). 
An assembly as in claim 1, characterised in that 
the longitudinal insert (60) has a cuneiform 

section. 
An assembly as in claim 1, characterised in that 
the longitudinal insert (60) exhibits two opposite 

surfaces (61, 62) which grip by friction on 
sawtooth-conformed opposite surfaces of the 

longitudinal throat (50). 
An assembly as in claim 1, characterised in that 
the second part (20) and the first part (10) of 

the assembly are provided at one or at both ends  
 

at the side (30) of the second part (20) and the 
other smaller side (70) of the first part 

opposite to its smaller side (40), with flat wings 
(80) for realising variously shaped profiles, such 

as T-shapes, double T shapes, Z shapes and the 
like, constituting a series of shapes which can be 

made into a frame.
