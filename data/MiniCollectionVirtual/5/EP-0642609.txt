<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the dyeing or printing of organic material, in 
particular fibre material, which comprises applying dyes containing at least one 
polymerisable double bond together with at least one colourless cationic compound 
containing at least one polymerisable double bond and, if desired, one or more colourless 
nonionic compounds containing at least one polymerisable double bond and, if desired, 
further auxiliaries to the organic material, in particular fibre material, and then fixing them 
by means of ionising radiation. The fixation of dyes containing activated unsaturated groups by exposure of organic 
material, even fibre material, to ionising radiation is known. Compared with the 
conventional methods for the fixation of dyes, in particular of reactive dyes, fixation 
produced by radiation is distinguished by the fact that, for example, fixing baths and fixing 
agents can be completely avoided. The simultaneous application and fixation of dye and 
textile finishing agents, for example for improving antistatic properties, reducing the soil-ability 
and the crease resistance, was regarded as a further advantage. Furthermore, to 
improve crosslinking of the dye and the fibre, polymerisable compounds were added to the 
dye liquor, and the dry dyed material was irradiated in order to fix the dye. An increase in 
the fixation yield could not be observed. The practice of dyeing, in particular with reactive dyes but also with disperse dyes, has 
recently led to increased demands on the quality of the dyeing and the economy of the 
dyeing process. Fixation of reactive dyes by means of ionising radiation alone has hitherto 
not yet been carried out in practice due to the low degrees of fixation. Consequently, the 
object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for fixation which in 
addition exhibits the advantages of fixation produced by radiation. It has now been found that this object can be achieved by means of the inventive process 
described below. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the dyeing or printing of  
 
organic material, in particular fibre material, which comprises applying dyes containing at 
least one polymerisable double bond together with at least one colourless cationic 
compound containing at least one polymerisable double bond and, if desired, one or more 
colourless nonionic compounds containing at least one polymerisable double bond and, if 
desired, further auxiliaries to the organic material, in particular
