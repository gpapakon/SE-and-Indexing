<ABSTRACT>
An ionic catalytic process for the production of poly- alpha -olefin resins of stereochemical configuration, which process permits improved control over tacticity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Such poly- alpha -olefins are produced to the desired tactic configurations by polymerization of  alpha -olefin monomers in the presence of a catalyst system comprising an ionic reaction product of a cyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal compound (a "metallocene") of specific structure and an activator compound comprising a cation capable of irreversibly reacting with at least one non-cyclopentadienyl ligand of the metallocene and an anion which is compatible with and non-coordinating to the metallocene cation generated upon reaction of the metallocene with said activator compound. By appropriate selection of the metallocene and activator components, the catalyst system can be tailored for the production of polymers having stereochemical configuration.

 APPLICATION FOR PATENTTitle: IONIC CATALYST FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLY- -OLEFINS OF CONTROLLED TACΗCITYSPECIFICATIONFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to an ionic catalytic process for the production of poly- -olefin resins which process permits improved control over tacticity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Such poly-α -olefins are produced to the desired tactic configurations by polymerization of α-olefin monomers in the presence of a catalyst system comprising an ionic reaction product of a cyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal compound (hereafter a "metallocene") of specific structure and an activator compound comprising a cation which is capable of reacting with a non-cyclopentadienyl ligand of the metallocene and an anion which is compatible with and non-coordinating to the metallocene cation generated upon reaction of the metallocene with said activator compound. By appropriate selection of the metallocene and activator components, the catalyst system can be tailored to the production of the desired wight average molecular weight (Mw) poly- -olefins with end group functionalization and select tacticity type and level such as isotactic, syndiotactic or hemiisotactic configurations.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polymers comprised of α-olefin monomers have hydrocarbyl groups pendent from the polymer backbone chain. Relative to the polymer backbone chain, the pendent hydrocarbyl groups may be arranged in different stereochemical configurations which are denominated as atactic, isotactic, or syndiotactic pendent group configuration. The degree and type of tacticity of a polyolefin molecule is a critical determinant of the physical properties which a resin composed of such polymer molecules will exhibit. Other critical determinants of the properties 

which a resin will exhibit are the type and relative concentration of monomers and comonomers, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer molecules comprising the resin bulk, the molecular weight distribution (MWD) and the composition distribution of the resin. Important from a commercial standpoint is the rate or productivity at which a catalyst system will produce a poly-α -olefin resin of a desired set of properties in terms of tacticity, weight average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution.The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of a poly-α -olefin is an important physical property determinant of the practical uses to which such polymer can be put. For end use applications which require high strength
