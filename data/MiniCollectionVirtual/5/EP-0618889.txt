<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel series of tri-substituted phenyl
derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical
compositions containing them, and to their use in medicine.Many hormones and neurotransmitters modulate tissue function by
elevating intra-cellular levels of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate
(cAMP). The cellular levels of cAMP are regulated by mechanisms
which control synthesis and breakdown. The synthesis of cAMP is
controlled by adenylyl cyclase which may be directly activated by
agents such as forskolin or indirectly activated by the binding of
specific agonists to cell surface receptors which are coupled to
adenylyl cyclase. The breakdown of cAMP is controlled by a family of
phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes, which also control the
breakdown of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). To date,
seven members of the family have been described (PDE I-VII) the
distribution of which varies from tissue to tissue. This suggests that
specific inhibitors of PDE isoenzymes could achieve differential
elevation of cAMP in different tissues, [for reviews of PDE distribution,
structure, function and regulation, see Beavo & Reifsnyder (1990)
TIPS, 11: 150-155 and Nicholson et al (1991) TIPS, 12: 19-27].There is clear evidence that elevation of cAMP in inflammatory
leukocytes leads to inhibition of their activation. Furthermore, elevation
of cAMP in airway smooth muscle has a spasmolytic effect. In these
tissues, PDE IV plays a major role in the hydrolysis of cAMP. It can be
expected, therefore, that selective inhibitors of PDE IV would have 
therapeutic effects in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, by
achieving both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects.The design of PDE IV inhibitors has met with limited success to date, in
that many of the potential PDE IV inhibitors which have been
synthesised have lacked potency and/or have been capable of
inhibiting more than one type of PDE isoenzyme in a non-selective
manner. Lack of a selective action has been a particular problem
given the widespread role of cAMP in vivo and what is needed are
potent selective PDE IV inhibitors with an inhibitory action against PDE
IV and little or no action against other PDE isoenzymes.A series of 3-cyanamino- and 3-chloro-(4-alkoxyphenyl)pyridazine
compounds are described in European Patent Specification No.
393500. Certain of these compounds are claimed to have
broncholoytic and anti-inflammatory activities.WO 92/06963 describes a group of arylpyridazinones for use as
