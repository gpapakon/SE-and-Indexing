<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new 3-arylidene and 3-heteroarylidene-2-oxindole
derivatives, to a process for
their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions
containing them and to their use as therapeutic agents.
WO 91/13055 discloses aryl- and heteroarylethenylene
derivatives having tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity.
EP-A-0525472 relates to indolyl-methylene-oxindole
compounds useful as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
WO 92/07830 discloses oxindole peptide antagonists useful
in the treatment of small cell mammalian cancers.
EP-A-0549348 refers to arylidene-heterocyclic compounds
useful as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.The present invention provides compounds having the
following general formula (I)

wherein
Y is a bicyclic ring system chosen from tetralin and
quinoline; each of R1 and R2 independently is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl or
C2-C6 alkanoyl;m is zero, 1 or 2;n is 1, 2 or 3;R4 is hydrogen, halogen or NH2;and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and
wherein either m is 1 or 2 or R4 is halogen or NH2.The invention includes within its scope all the possible
isomers, stereoisomers, in particular Z and E isomers and
their mixtures, and the metabolites and the metabolic
precursors or bio-precursors (otherwise known as pro-drugs)
of the compounds of formula (I).
The alkyl moiety in the alkanoyl groups, may be branched or
straight alkyl chain. A C2-C6 alkanoyl group is preferably
a C2-C4 alkanoyl group, in particular acetyl, propionyl or
butyryl.
A halogen is preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine, in
particular fluorine or chlorine.
The term "tetralin" which comes from the trademark
TETRALINÂ® preferably is meant to refer to a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene
ring system. When Y is tetralin preferably the oxindolylidene
substituent is on the benzene moiety whereas the R1O-group(s)
may be on either of the rings.
When tetralin is substituted at the position 1' by the
oxindolylidene substituent, preferably at least one -OR1
group is present at the positions 2', 4', 5' and/or 8'.
Analogously when tetralin is substituted at the 2'-position
by the oxindolylidene substituent, preferably at least one
-OR1 group is present at the positions 1', 3',4', 5' and/or
8'.
When Y is quinoline the oxindolylidene group is preferably
attached to the 4'- or 5'-position of the quinoline ring
whereas the R1O substituents may be on either of the rings
of said ring system.
When Y is quinoline, it is preferably substituted at the
positions 4' or 5' by the oxindolylidene substituent and at
least one OR' substituent is present,
