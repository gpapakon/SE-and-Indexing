<ABSTRACT>
The vector control method for an induction motor utilizes an inverter (2) and 
a vector controller (10). The vector controller provides control voltage Vu, Vv, 

Vw, in response to an excitation current command i
1d

excitation current being fed to said induction motor, a desired rotation speed 

command ω
r
*, and a primary frequency ω, for controlling the inverter to vary a 
motor speed. The method comprises the steps of:

 
   monitoring a primary current being fed to the induction motor to derive 

therefrom an excitation current i
1d
 and a torque current i
1q
;
 

   multiplying a torque value represented by thus detected torque current i
1q
 
by a predetermined motor constant 
Km
 to obtain a slip frequency ω
s
; and
 

   adding thus obtained slip frequency ω
s
 to the rotation speed command ω
r
* 
to determine the primary frequency ω (ω = ω
r

s
). The method is characterized 
to delay by integration the detected torque current i
1q
 in order to give a delayed 
torque current i
1q'
 as the torque value to be processed in determining the primary 
frequency ω. Consequently, it is possible to cancel undesired transient variation 

from appearing in the calculated slip frequency and therefore in the primary 
frequency, which cont
ributes to a consistent and precise speed control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a vector control method for controlling a 
rotor speed of an induction motor, and more particularly to such a vector control 
method for the induction motor without relying upon a speed detector. A vector control system for the induction motor is known in the art to be 
advantageous for quick and precise control of the induction motor, in which a 
control is made to vary a frequency of a primary current supplied to the induction 
motor. U.S.P. 4,680,526 discloses a vector control system for the induction 
motor in which the primary current is analyzed to detect an excitation current and 
a torque current. These detected currents are processed to give an estimated 
rotation speed of the motor without using a speed detector. Thus estimated 
rotation speed is processed in relation to a speed command signal representative 
of an intended rotation speed in order to obtain a required torque current at 
which the estimated rotation speed becomes equal to the intended rotation 
speed, after which the required torque current is compared with the detected 
torque current for determining the primary frequency. Thus, this method requires 
speed operation for obtaining the estimated rotation speed, in addition to current 
operation of determining the primary frequency, therefore necessitates 
complicated operations. 
To avoid the complicated operations for determination of the primary frequency, it 
is contemplated to obtain a slip frequency as a product of the detected torque 
current and a predetermined motor constant, and to determine the primary 
frequency as the sum of the slip frequency and a the rotation speed command  
 
signal selected by the user. However, this scheme poses another problem that 
the slip frequency is directly influenced by a transient variation in the torque 
current caused when changing the motor speed, i.e., changing the rotation speed 
command signal, resulting in an over-responsive variation in the primary 
frequency. Therefore, the above scheme fails to give precise speed control of the 
motor. The above problem has been reduced in a vector control method for an 
induction motor in accordance with the present invention which is capable of 
assuring precise and consistent speed control, yet without relying upon a speed 
detector. The vector control method of the present invention according to Claim 1 utilizes an inverter 
which provides an AC current of varying voltage and frequency to the induction motor, 
and a vector controller, and a vector
