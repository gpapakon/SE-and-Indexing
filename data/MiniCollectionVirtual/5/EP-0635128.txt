<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved sensors and to a method of determining the level
of humidity of an atmosphere.It is known that certain ceramic materials exhibit a change in resistance or impedance
with changes in the humidity of the atmosphere to which they are exposed. Thus,
these ceramic materials have been proposed for use in humidity sensors.Humidity sensors comprising such ceramic materials offer advantages over
conventional hygrometers of the kind which rely on changes of capacitance with
change in humidity because changes in resistance are easier to monitor and register
electronically.IEEE Transactions an Electron Devices, Vol 1 ED-29, No. 1, January 1993 describes
humidity sensors comprising MgCr2O4 - TiO2 and Ba2xSrx TiO3 doped with MgCr2O4.
However, in use, the base resistance of the ceramic material gradually increases,
necessitating a heat cleaning process between successive operations.Another known humidity sensitive ceramic is Nb2O5 doped with TiO2. However, as
described in Sensors and Actuators 24(1990) 55-60, the ceramic shows a gradual
increase in impedance with time. Thus an aging process is required to produce a
stable sensitivity to humidity.Sensors and Actuators 4(1983) 85-96 describes how humidity sensitive ceramics
MgCr2O4 - TiO2, TiO2 - V2O5 and Fe2O3 have been observed to show a progressive
drift in resistance when exposed to highly humid environments.The problems of drift in resistance and the need for heat cleaning have been
overcome in some humidity sensors by the addition of small amounts of alkali ions.
However these then produce problems with the stability of the alkali ions at the surface
of the sensing materials. Such materials are MgFe2O4 doped with 2 mol% K+, Li+ or
Na+ and ZnCr2O4 - LiZnVO4 as described in Sensors and Actuators 10(1986) 379-398. A MgAl2O4 sensor, as described in Sensors and Actuators 4 (1983) 85-96, has good
humidity sensitivity. However, the impedance in less humid atmospheres was found
to be too high for practical measurements.A sensor consisting of SnO2 with 10% Al2O3 and 5% TiO2 was found to have
shortcomings due to significant temperature dependence and sensitivity to inflammable
gases as described in Sensors and Actuators 16(1989) 1-11.The materials CaMnO3, SrFeO3, BaTiO3, LaCrO3 and Ba0.998Sb0.002TiO3 were found to
be insensitive to humidity changes. CaTiO3 CaSnO3, SrTiO3 and SrSnO3 showed
humidity sensitivity at elevated temperature but had conductivities too small for
practical use as humidity sensors. The materials Co0.9La0.1TiO3,
