<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure describes a magneto-optical recording 
and readout method which comprises making a tape-type 

magneto-optical recording medium (1) run in front of at least a 
single pole of a permanent magnet (2) or an electromagnet at a 

position forwards of an optical head relative to the 
running direction of said recording medium, without 

contacting said magnet so as to cross at a substantial 
right angle to magnetic force lines (3), thereby initialising 

said recording medium or erasing information therein,
 

   said tape-type magneto-optical recording medium (1) having 
at least a magneto-optical recording layer on one side of a 

base film having a thickness of not more than 50 µm; and
 

   effecting recording of information by irradiating 
beams to the recording medium under application of an 

external magnetic field of not more than 24 kA/m.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical 
recording and reading-out method. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a magneto-optical recording 
and reading-out method comprising irradiating beams to a 
tape-type re-writable and erasable magneto-optical 
recording medium having at least a magneto-optical 
recording layer on one side of a base film (substrate) 
having a thickness of not more than 50 µm. With increase of the amount of information in recent 
years, there is a strong request for an information 
recording and readout system which is capable of compact 
recording, storage and stable retention of massive amount 
of information from various sources such as documents, 
pictures and sounds. Magneto-optical recording has a feature such as high 
storage capacity per unit area, i.e., high area storage 
density owing to use of beams closed down to the threshold 
of diffraction of approximately 1 µm. The conventional disc-type magneto-optical recording 
medium has an advantage that it is capable of random access 
to the recorded signal. Also, in this magneto-optical 
recording medium, since beams are irradiated to the 
magnetic layer via a transparent substrate having a  
 
thickness of approximately 1.2 mm, the dust and flaws on 
the irradiated surface of the substrate can hardly become a 
cause of error. However, the disc-type magneto-optical recording 
medium is not high in storage capacity per unit volume, 
i.e., volume storage density, because of the relatively 
large thickness (1.2 mm) of the substrate. Even if the 
substrate is reduced in thickness for elevating the volume 
storage density, no drastic improvement of the volume 
storage density can be expected as far as the recording 
medium has a disc-like shape because the cartridge housing 
of the disc-type recording medium is incapable of extreme 
reduction of thickness. In the case of magnetic tape, it is possible to 
significantly elevate the volume storage density owing to 
the structural features that the substrate can be reduced 
in thickness and the tapes can be housed in winding in a 
cartridge. A tape-type magnetic recording medium is applied to 
digital video recording, etc., but its memory capacity is 
not remarkably large since the area storage density thereof 
is not so high as optical disc. Also, the tape-type 
magnetic recording medium is small in coercive force and 
high in saturation magnetization as compared with the disc-type 
magneto-optical recording medium, so that the tape-type 
recording medium
