<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acoustic wave touch panels
and signal conditioning circuits for acoustic wave touch
panels. This invention also relates to a controller having
a signal conditioning circuit for processing X and Y axis
sense signals received from the touch panel utilizing
common mode rejection and having a touch position detector
and a touch pressure detector that are accurate and stable,
the controller allowing the touch panel to be used in
hostile environments.Known acoustic wave touch panels have included
a substrate and X and Y axis transmitting
transducers mounted thereon to impart acoustic waves
for propagation in the substrate. The acoustic
waves imparted into the substrate are reflected, by
respective X and Y axis reflective arrays, along a
number of substantially parallel paths that extend
across a touch area of the substrate to second,
respective X and Y axis reflective arrays. These
latter arrays reflect the acoustic waves incident
thereto to respective X and Y receiving transducers
mounted on the substrate. Other known acoustic wave 
touch panels utilize only one transceiving
transducer and one associated reflective array per
axis. More particularly, each of these transducers
functions to impart an acoustic wave into the
substrate for reflection by an associated array
along a number of substantially parallel paths
across the touch surface of the panel to a
reflective edge of the substrate or a reflective
grating disposed therein. The reflective edge or
grating reflects the acoustic waves incident thereto
back across the touch surface of the panel to the
associated reflective array which in turn reflects
the waves back to the transducer for sensing.Controllers are provided for these types of
acoustic wave touch panels for generating drive
signals to be applied to the X and Y axis
transmitting transducers; for receiving and
amplifying the X and Y axis sense signals from the
transducers; and for determining the coordinate of a
touch on the panel from the respective X and Y axis
sense signals.US Patent No. 4644100 discloses a touch panel system
comprising a substrate and a means for generating and
receiving surface acoustic waves on a touch surface of the
substrate. The system also comprises means responsive to a
surface wave absorbing touch on the touch surface, for
developing an output signal representative of the degree of
absorbtion of the acoustic wave by the touch. The output
signal has a first characteristic which indicates the
position of the touch on the surface, and a second
