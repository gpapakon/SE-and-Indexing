<ABSTRACT>
An integrated semiconductor memory has a block decoder BKDEC with block selection signals BKS and several individually actuable memory field block units BK. The memory field block units BK have memory cells that can be driven by word and bit lines NWL, NBL, N

  NOt  and redundant memory cells RMC that can be driven by redundant word lines RWL. The memory field block units BK have programmable redundant block decoders RBK that allow, together with redundant word line decoders RWDEC, redundant word lines RWL to be selected. When a redundant word line RWL is to be selected, only the memory field block unit BK in which the redundant word line RWL to be selected is contained is activated, thus suppressing the otherwise usual activation by means of a corresponding block selection signal BKS. The redundant word line RWL to be selected, together with its redundant memory cells RMC, needs therefore not be located in the same memory field block unit BK as the memory cells to be replaced, together with their normal word line NWL, but may also be located in (any) other memory field block unit BK. Integrated semiconductor memories may thus be produced with a higher yield.
