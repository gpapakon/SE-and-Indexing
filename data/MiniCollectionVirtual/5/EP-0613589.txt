<DESCRIPTION>
 MAKING ALKALI METAL ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICESThe present invention relates to making alkali metal energy conversion devices, particularly those having a solid electrolyte member separating respective electrode spaces, the electrolyte member being conductive to ions of the alkali metal, and an insulating member joined to the electrolyte member to enable seals to be formed via the insulating member between the electrolyte member and electronically conductive current collecting members of the device. An example of alkali metal energy conversion devices of this type is the sodium sulphur cell. However the present invention is applicable to any corresponding form of alkali metal energy conversion device in which it is necessary to join a solid electrolyte member to an insulating member within the cell.Commonly, the solid electrolyte member is a ceramic, typically beta alumina ceramic which is conductive to ions of sodium. Then the insulating member can be made of alpha alumina. Hitherto most methods proposed for joining the solid electrolyte member to the insulating member comprise the use of a glazing method so that a glass seal is formed between the two members. It is important that the glass chosen for this purpose is resistant to chemical attack from the electrode materials employed within the cell, and is also matched as far as possible to the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials of the electrolyte member and the insulating member.United Kingdom patent 2083943B has described the use as a material for forming the join or seal between the electrolyte member and the insulating member of a hardened mixture of glass powder and ceramic powder. The resulting seal comprises particles of ceramic powder in a glassy matrix and it has been found that the seals have superior characteristics and resistance to attack. In particular, the resultant seal material is more resistant to cracking 

 under the operating conditions of a sodium sulphur cell for example.In the above mentioned patent, the mixture of glass and ceramic powders is suspended in a liquid with a high viscosity, particularly glycerine. One of the electrolyte member or the insulating member is then immersed in this liquid mixture to coat the member where it is to be joined to the other member. The two members are then pressed together and the liquid of the coating material is expelled at a suitable temperature. The coating material is then "age hardened by heating to the operating temperature of the glass" so that a join having the required

 CLAIMS
1. A method of making an alkali metal energy conversion device having a solid electrolyte member separating respective electrode spaces, the electrolyte member being conductive to ions of the alkali metal, and an insulating member joined to the electrolyte member to enable seals to be formed via the insulating member between the electrolyte member and an electronically conductive current collecting member of the device, the insulating member being joined to the electrolyte member by means of a hardened sealant incorporating glass powder at an interface between the members, wherein dry powder incorporating glass powder is moulded and compressed to form a self supporting dry mass of the powder having a shape substantially conforming to said interface, the electrolyte member and the insulating member are then brought together into the joining position with the dry mass of the powder at said interface, and the members are heated to melt the glass powder to join the members.
2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said dry powder is moulded and compressed on to one of the electrolyte member and the insulating member so that said dry mass is formed affixed thereto.
3. A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein said dry powder is heated when moulded and compressed to produce at least partial sintering of the dry mass.
4. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the dry powder comprises a dry mixture of glass powder and ceramic powder. 


 5. A method as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the ceramic powder is alpha alumina.
6. A method as claimed in either of Claims 4 or 5, wherein the dry mixture comprises between 25 and 80% by weight of glass powder and between 20 and 75% by weight of ceramic powder.
7. A method as claimed in Claim 6 , wherein the dry mixture comprises between 60 and 75% by weight of glass powder and between 25 and 40% by weight of ceramic powder.
8. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein up to 10% by weight of a dry binder powder is mixed with the dry powder.
9. A method as claimed in Claim 8, wherein the dry binder powder is a dry form of polyethylene glycol.
10. A method as claimed in either of Claims 8 or 9, wherein the dry powders are wet mixed by adding a volatile liquid to dissolve the dry binder powder, and after wet mixing driving off the volatile liquid to leave a dry powder mixture.
11. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the electrolyte member is tubular having an open end which is joined to a corresponding ring or disc shaped insulating member, wherein the self supporting dry mass of the powder is formed as a ring.
12. A method as claimed in Claim 11 as dependent on Claim 2 wherein the dry mass is formed affixed to the insulating member. 


 13. A method as claimed in Claim 12 wherein the ring or disc shaped insulating member includes a first surface generally parallel to the plane of the member to interface with an annular end surface at the open end of the tubular electrolyte member, and a second surface generally perpendicular to the first surface to fit about or in the electrolyte member at said open end, wherein the insulating member is placed with its plane generally horizontal and said first surface directed upwards, said dry powder is applied to said first surface between said second surface and a further surface generally parallel to said second surface forming a channel therebetween, and a tubular ram is pressed down into the channel to compress the dry powder to form said dry mass affixed to said first surface.
14. A method as claimed in Claim 13 wherein said further surf ce is formed by a removable former located on or about the insulating member to form said channel.
15. A method as claimed in Claim 13 wherein said further surface is formed in said insulating member.
16. A method as claimed in either of Claims 13 or 14, wherein the ram is shaped in cross section to deflect said dry mixture during compressing towards said second surface.
17. A method as claimed in Claim 15 wherein said first surface and said further surface are extended by means of removable formers to deepen the channel therebetween so as to receive the uncompressed dry powders.
