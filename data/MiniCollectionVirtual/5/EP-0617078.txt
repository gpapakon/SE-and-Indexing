<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of plasticiser-containing polyvinyl butyrals (PVBs) which are suitable for the production of elastic interlayer films having improved adhesion-reducing properties for laminated glass sheets made from silicate glass. They contain, as adhesion-reducing additives, effective amounts of salts of metals from groups Ia, IIa, IIb, IIIa of the Periodic Table of the Elements and naturally occuring resin acids or derivatives of resin acids and optionally conventional stablisers and auxiliaries. They are prepared by mixing the components and plasticating the component mixtures. They can be moulded by conventional thermoplastic methods and are suitable for the production of plasticised PVB films which have advantageously improved adhesion-reducing properties with respect to silicate glass sheets and can advantageously be used for the production of silicate laminated glass sheets.
