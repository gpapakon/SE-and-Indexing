<ABSTRACT>
A shielded data connector (200) performing as an 
interface to a local area network is engageable with a complementary 

connector for interconnecting electronic components 
to the network. It includes an insulating terminal 

support housing (202) having a front mating face and a rear 
face and mounting a plurality of terminals having contact 

portions engageable with contacts of the complementary connector. 
The terminal support housing has shield means (230). 

The data connector is in the form of a plug-in module for the 
network and includes an edge card (280) which has data traces 

electrically connected to terminals of the terminal support 
housing and is pluggable into and removable from an edge card 

connector (150B) mounted in a wall box (2) and terminating a 
multiconductor shielded communications cable (120) of the 

network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interface for 
accommodating communication network systems where more than 
one type of interface device is utilized in the same local 
area. Modular connections allow adaptation between two 
different interface devices using two different telecommunication 
cables. Communication network systems vary in scope and 
design as directed by the manufacturers of the interfacing 
devices. Some network interface devices utilize shielded 
systems whereas others utilize an unshielded system. Several 
designs of interfacing devices are known in the art. For example, US-A-4 501 459 and 4 193 654 relate to 
shielded connectors for coupling two shielded cables of a 
shielded information network system. These connectors are 
hermaphroditic in nature, that is, two identical connectors 
are utilized for the connection, and each connector can 
accommodate four lines of information. Connectors for unshielded network interfaces are 
also known, for example, US-A-4 210 376; 4 221 458; 4 292 
736 and 4 231 628 relate to data network connectors or 
modular jacks, which are mountable to printed circuit 
boards, and are capable of accommodating between four and 
eight lines of communication. These connectors include 
stamped and formed contacts for receiving a mating plug. Edge card connectors for interconnecting printed 
circuit boards to multi-conductor cable are also known in 
the art. For example, US-A-3 860 318 shows an edge 
connector having stamped and formed contacts providing 
interconnection to circuit board traces on one end, while on 
the opposite end, providing a barrel-type insulation displacement 
device for terminating individual conductors. GB-A-1 171 549 describes an adaptor for enabling a 
standard electronic module, which can be slid into racks or 
crates to form a complete system of electronic apparatus and 
which has pin contacts on the back of the module, to be 
connected to a rack or crate utilising edge connector strips.  
 There is disclosed in US-A-4 407 559 a local area 
network receptacle assembly for interconnection of electronic 
equipment to a local area network, including a modular electrical 
connector having at least one signal carrying contact 
disposed at a front mating face for interconnection with at 
least one mating contact of a complementary connector, the 
modular electrical connector being electrically connected to 
a shielded cable having individual data communication conductors 
which form the network, the mcdular electrical connector 
being

A data connector (200) performing as an interface to a 
local area network and being engageable with a complementary 

connector (500) for interconnecting electronic components to 
the network, the data connector (200) including an insulating 

terminal support housing (202) having a front mating face, a 
rear face, and a terminal support platform (205) extending 

between the faces which positions a plurality of terminals 
(214) onto the terminal support platform (205), each with 

resilient contact tongues (218) adjacent the front mating face, 
deflectable towards the terminal support platform (205) and engageable with respective contacts of the complementary connector when 

the mating face of the terminal support housing (202) is 
interconnected with the complementary connector (500); and 

shield means (230,260) surrounding the terminals (214) and 
the terminal support housing (202); the data connector (200) 

being characterized in that:
 
   an edge card (280) is secured to said terminal support 

housing (202), the edge card (280) extending rearwardly and including data traces 
(284) electrically connected to said terminals (214) of the terminal support housing (202), 

the data connector (200) is modular 
in profile being connectable and disconnectable to a multi-conductor 

shielded data cable (130) within the network via an 
edge card connector (150B) interconnected to the data cable 

(130) and arranged to receive said edge card, thereby establishing an electrical connection between said data traces and corresponding 
conductors in the interconnected cable.
