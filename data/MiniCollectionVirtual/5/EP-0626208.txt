<ABSTRACT>
An improved power supply (5) for an electrostatic 
spray gun having a voltage multiplier circuit (12) adjusts 

to variations in the output load conditions of the 
multiplier circuit (12) and dynamically modifies the 

operational loadline of the multiplier circuit (12) in 
order to maintain optimal operating conditions for the 

spray gun notwithstanding output load variations. The 
power supply (5) utilizes a loadline manipulation circuit 

(16) coupled to a feedback circuit (14) that monitors the 
output load, and the manipulation circuit (16), in 

response to a feedback signal from the feedback circuit 
(14) that is proportional to the output load, varies the 

input voltage level to the multiplier circuit (12) to 
modify the loadline of the power supply (5) in response to 

varying load conditions. The manipulator means (16) of 
the power supply (5) has memory means (29) to store a 

variety of external commands which will control the 
manipulation means (16) and a user interface (25) to enter 

the external commands into the memory (29). The power 
supply (5) also comprises a voltage limiting circuit (60) 

coupled to the output of the multiplier circuit (12) which 
regulates the output voltage level of the multiplier 

circuit (12) so that when the output load current 
increases above a predetermined maximum level the output 

voltage is reduced to reduce the high voltage stress on 
the multiplier circuit (12) and high voltage circuitry and 

reduce the amount of insulation that must surround the 
multiplier circuit (12) and high voltage circuitry of the 

power supply (5) in order to insulate it from ground 
potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to high voltage
power supplies used in electrostatic spray guns and
specifically to a power supply that dynamically and
selectively varies its operation in response to varying
load conditions.Electrostatic spray guns are used for various applications
to spray liquid and powder coatings onto various
moving or stationary objects and parts. Generally, the
coating is atomized and emitted as a mist from the end
of the gun having a high voltage electrode. The electrode
creates and electric field and an ion flux through
which the sprayed particles pass, and the ion bombardment
electrostatically charges the atomized coating particles
passing through the ion-rich electric field. The
electrostatically charged coating particles are then
directed towards the object being sprayed, which is typically
electrically grounded, so that the charged particles
emitted from the end of the gun are attracted to the
object to provide better adherence and coverage of the
object with coating material. "Spray gun" as used herein
includes any electrostatic spray device, whether or not
hand-held, and whether or not configured in the shape
of a pistol.Many hand-held electrostatic spray guns utilize an
internal high voltage power supply to charge the electrode.
These spray guns have a low level voltage input,
for example from 12 to 30 volts DC, which is boosted by
the internal power supply of the gun to a level that is
desirable for the charging electrode, usually 50 kilovolt
(KV) or more. A low voltage level input allows the input
power line to the gun to be smaller and more flexible,
and hence more maneuverable, because it is not necessary
to insulate the line to handle high voltage levels.
The internal power supply has a voltage multiplier section
or circuit that increases the low level supply voltage
to a voltage level that is sufficiently high to electrostatically
charge the spray particles. The multiplier circuit
generally operates according to a characteristic power
loadline which relates a) the output or load current delivered
to the electrode, i.e., the amount of current, in
microamperes (ÂµA), drawn to charge the spray particles,
to b) the output voltage at the charging electrode.The characteristic power loadline of a spray gun
multiplier circuit determines the quantity and distribution
of charge delivered to the spray particles, and thus controls
the quality of the coating on the object being
sprayed. Typically, the characteristic power loadline of
the gun multiplier circuit is such that the
