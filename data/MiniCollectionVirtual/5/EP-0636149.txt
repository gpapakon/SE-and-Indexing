<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crosslinked hydrophilic resins, methods for preparing crosslinked hydrophilic resins and
absorbent structures incorporating the crosslinked hydrophilic resins.Hydrophilic resins (also referred to as superabsorbent polymers) are primarily used in personal care products
which absorb body fluids, for example baby diapers, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene products. In
such applications, hydrophilic resin particles are incorporated into absorbent structures which contain for example,
synthetic and natural fiber or paper based woven and non-woven structures, and toughened masses of fibers, such
as fluff pads. The materials used in such structures can instantaneously absorb aqueous fluids and distribute them
over the whole absorbent structure. The structures, in the absence of hydrophilic resin particles, have limited absorption
capacity, and are bulky due to the large amount of material needed to provide acceptable absorption capacity and do
not retain fluid under pressure. A means for improving the absorbency and fluid retention characteristics of such absorbent
structures is to incorporate hydrophilic resin particles which imbibe fluids to form a swollen hydrogel material,
see U.S. Patent 4,610,678. The hydrophilic resin particles quickly absorb fluids and retain such fluids to prevent leakage
and give the absorbent structure a "dry feel" even when wetted.When the water-absorption capacity of hydrophilic resins is increased, the fraction of water-soluble polymer present
in the resin is generally increased. At the same time the gel strength of the swollen gel, its absorption capacity under
pressure and absorption speed are reduced. The water absorbent resin tends to agglomerate upon wetting which
results in a reduction of its absorption capacity and in gel blockage which prevents transport of fluids within the absorbent
structure. This is a particular problem when a large fraction of the absorbent structure is replaced with hydrophilic
resin particles to prepare a thin absorbent device.One method of improving the absorption characteristics is to incorporate a compound which crosslinks the final
product into the monomer mixture used to prepare the hydrophilic resin. Brandt U.S. Patent 4,654,039 discloses the
preparation of hydrophilic resins and known crosslinking agents for such resins, Column 6 line 34 to Column 7, line
16. Parks U.S. Patent 4,295,987 discloses the use of ethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate and
methylene-bisacrylamide as
