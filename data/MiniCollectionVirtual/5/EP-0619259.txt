<ABSTRACT>
The sheet-collating device comprises a frame (10), a plurality of compartments (20) which are superposed in this frame for loading stacks of paper (28), each compartment (20) being equipped with a device for ejecting individual sheets and a transfer device, and a vertical conveyor (26) adjacent to the transfer devices of the compartments (20) in order to receive, by means of these transfer devices, sheets ejected from their compartment, and in order to convey them towards a collating station. The ejection device comprises several perforated endless belts (34) mounted on two spaced-apart return (idle) rollers (36, 38) and a chamber (46) at reduced pressure (under partial vacuum) which is surrounded by the belts (34) and has air-passage openings distributed in its lower wall which is adjacent to the inner face of the lower strand (34a) of the belts (34). The opposite face of the lower strand of the belts (34) is located opposite the upper sheet (28a) of the stack parallel to the latter and at a distance which is maintained essentially constant by means of a movable plate (22) on which the stack (28) rests.

Sheet collating machine comprising a frame (10), a plurality of trays (20) 
superimposed in this frame to be loaded with stacks of paper (28), each tray (20) 

being equipped with a device for ejecting individual sheets and a transfer device, 
and a vertical conveyor (26) adjacent to the devices for transferring the trays (20) 

in order to receive, by means of the transfer devices, sheets ejected from their trays 
and to advance them to a collating station, characterised in that the ejection device 

comprises at least one endless perforated tape (34) mounted on two spaced return 
idlers (36, 38) and a vacuum chamber (46) surrounded by the tape (34) and having 

air passage apertures distributed in its lower wall which is adjacent to the inner 
face of the lower side (34a) of the tape (34), the opposite face of the lower side of 

the tape (34) being situated opposite the top sheet (28a) in the stack parallel to the 
latter and at a distance maintained essentially constant by a movable plate (22) on 

which the stack (28) rests. 
Collating machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the transfer device 
consists of a drive roller (56) and at least one nipping roller (58), the gap formed 

between the drive roller and the nipping roller being situated essentially in the 
plane of the lower side (34a) of the perforated tape (34). 
Collating machine according to claim 2, characterised in that the periphery of the 
drive roller (56) is adjacent to a vertical conveyor belt (50) of the conveyor (26), 

the face of which opposite the drive roller (56) bears against an idler (60), a 
deflecting element (66) being associated with the periphery of the drive roller (56) 

in order to direct the front edge of a sheet advanced by the conveying roller (56) 
into the gap formed between the latter and the belt (50) of the conveyor (26). 
Collating machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
ejection device, the transfer device and the conveyor are arranged in such a manner 

that a sheet separated from its stack (28) and adhering by suction to the lower face 
of the tape (34), advanced by the tape to the transfer device, taken up by the latter  

 
and transferred to the conveyor (26) still adheres to the tape (34) at least via its 

rear edge when it is taken up by the conveyor (26). 
Collating machine according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that an air stream is directed into a space created between the lower face of the top 

sheet (28a) drawn by suction against the perforated tape (34) and the upper face of 
the next sheet (28b) in the stack (28) by means of at least one annular separating 

element (44) which extends parallel to the tape (34) and the thickness of which is 
greater than that of the tape, so as to cause local deform
ation of the sheet (28a) 
drawn by suction in the longitudinal direction of the latter. 
Collating machine according to claim 5, characterised in that the separating 
element consists of an endless belt (44) fitted around the two return idlers (36, 38). 
Collating machine according to either of claims 5 and 6, characterised in that 
several perforated tapes (34) are fitted around the return idlers (36, 38) and extend 

in parallel at a short distance from one another, the said belt (44) being arranged 
essentially in the centre of the tapes (34). 
Collating machine according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that an air stream is directed on to the lateral edges and/or the front edge of the 

stack (28) in order to facilitate separation of the sheets. 
Collating machine according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the frame (10) has a generally prismatic shape and the conveyor (26) is 

arranged along one side of the frame, while the trays (22) are arranged on the 
opposite side of the frame. 
Collating machine according to claim 4, characterised in that the trays (22) project 
laterally from the frame (10) relative to an oblique side (18a) of the prismatic 

shape of the latter.
