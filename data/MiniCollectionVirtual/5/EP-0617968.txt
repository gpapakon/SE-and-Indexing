<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of formula 

where R₁ and R₂ are independently hydrogen or optionally-substituted 
C₁₋₄alkyl or aryl, or R₁ and R₂ are joined together to form a 

monocyclic or bicyclic ring system, are HIV protease inhibitors. These 
compounds are useful in the prevention or treatment of infection by 

HIV and in the treatment of AIDS, either as compounds, 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical composition 

ingredients, whether or not in combination with other antivirals, 
immunomodulators, antibiotics or vaccines. Methods of treating AIDS 

and methods of preventing or treating infection by HIV are also 
described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with combinations of compounds which
inhibit the protease encoded by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and are of value in the
prevention of infection by HIV, the treatment of infection by HIV and
the treatment of the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS). It also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the
compounds and to the use of the present compounds and other
agents for the preparation of a medicament for treatment of AIDS and viral infection by HIV.A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) is the etiological agent of the complex disease that includes
progressive destruction of the immune system (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome; AIDS) and degeneration of the central and
peripheral nervous system. This virus was previously known as LAV,
HTLV-III, or ARV. A common feature of retrovirus replication is the
extensive post-translational processing of precursor polyproteins by a
virally encoded protease to generate mature viral proteins required for
virus assembly and function. Inhibition of this processing prevents the
production of normally infectious virus. For example, Kohl, N.E. et
al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.85, 4686 (1988) demonstrated that genetic
inactivation of the HIV encoded protease resulted in the production of
immature, non-infectious virus particles. These results indicate that 
inhibition of the HIV protease represents a viable method for the
treatment of AIDS and the prevention or treatment of infection by HIV.The nucleotide sequence of HIV shows the presence of a pol
gene in one open reading frame [Ratner, L. etal., Nature, 313,
277(1985)]. Amino acid sequence homology provides evidence that the
pol sequence encodes reverse transcriptase, an endonuclease and an HIV
protease [Toh, H. etal., EMBO J. 4, 1267 (1985); Power, M.D. etal.,
Science, 231, 1567 (1986); Pearl, L.H. etal., Nature329, 351 (1987)].
Applicants demonstrate that the compounds of this invention are
inhibitors of HIV protease.Compounds of formula I, as herein defined, are disclosed.
These compounds are useful in the inhibition of HIV protease, the
prevention of infection by HIV, the treatment of infection by HIV and
in the treatment of AIDS,
in combination with other antivirals, immunomodulators, antibiotics or
vaccines. Methods of treating AIDS, methods of preventing infection
by HIV, and methods of treating infection by HIV are also disclosed.Some abbreviations that may appear in this
