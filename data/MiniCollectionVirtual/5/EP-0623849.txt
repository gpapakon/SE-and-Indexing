<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is processing apparatus for 
processing photosensitive materials in which a 

processing channel (25) is provided thorugh which the 
material (21) being processed passes. The processing 

channel (25) contains textured surfaces with canted 
passageways to reduce frictional forces and adherence 

between the photosensitive material and the contacting 
surfaces of the processing channel (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
photographic processing apparatus, and is more
particularly concerned with textured surfaces for use
therewith.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. With the
development step being the most critical and sensitive
to variations induced by time, temperature, agitation
and chemical activity. These steps lend themselves to
mechanization by conveying a continuous web of film or
cut sheets of film or photographic paper sequentially
through a series of stations or tanks, each one
containing a different processing liquid appropriate
to the process step at that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks which contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The chemicals contained in the processing
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity
and are seasoned by constituents of the photosensitive
materials that leach out during the photographic
process; and after the chemicals are used the
chemicals must be disposed of in an environmentally
safe manner. Thus, it is important in all sizes of
photofinishing apparatus to reduce the volume of
processing solution. The prior art suggest various 
types of replenishing systems which add or subtract
specific chemicals to the processing solution to
maintain a consistency of photographic characteristics
in the material developed. It is possible to maintain
reasonable consistency of photographic characteristics
only for a certain period of replenishment. After a
processing solution has been used a given number of
times, the solution is discarded and a new processing
solution is added to the tank.Activity degradation due to instability of
the chemistry, or chemical contamination, after the
components of the processing solution are mixed
together causes one to discard the processing solution
in smaller volume tanks more frequently than larger
volume tanks. Some of the steps in the photographic
process utilize processing solutions which contain
chemicals that are unstable, i.e., they have a short
process life. Thus, processing solutions in tanks.
which contain unstable chemicals are discarded more
frequently than processing solutions in tanks which
contain stable chemicals.Textured
