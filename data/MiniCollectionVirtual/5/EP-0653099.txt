<ABSTRACT>
In a bobbin having a first board (55) and a second board (57) opposed to the first board, first and second sleeves (59, 61) are integral with the first and the second boards, respectively. The first sleeve is inserted in the second sleeve. A divider sleeve (63) is integrated with the second board with the divider sleeve surrounding the second sleeve and a first perforation of the second board. The divider sleeve is interposed between the first and the second board with the divider sleeve surrounding the first sleeve and with the divider sleeve welded or glued to the first board. First-set and second-set connectors (51, 53) are fixed to the bobbin. A first coil (43) is attached around the divider sleeve and is connected to the first-set connectors. A second coil (45) is attached around the second sleeve and is connected to the second-set connectors through the first perforation. The divider sleeve may be integral with the first board. First and second coupling arms (97, 99) may be integral with the first board and may pass second and third perforations of the second board with the coupling peak portions of the first and the second coupling arms brought into contact with a surface of the second board. The first and the second coupling arms may pass first and second ditches of the second board. In this event, the divider sleeve is brought into contact with the first or the second board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a 
transformer. A conventional transformer comprises the bobbin, 
first and second coils attached to the bobbin, a magnetic 
core attached to the bobbin, and first-set and second-set 
connectors. The first and the second coils are attached 
around the sleeve between the divider plates. The first 
and the second coils are connected to the first-set and 
the second-set converters, respectively. In the bobbin and the transformer, it is hardly 
possible to reliably insulate the first coil from the  
 
second coil by the divider plates. This is because the 
divider plates do not surround the first coil or the 
second coil. Also, inasmuch as the divider plates are 
perpendicular to the sleeve and are high in height, the 
bobbin and the transformer are high in height. The EP-A-0 325 467 discloses a tranformer according 
the preambles of independent claims 1 to 3. It is an object of this invention to 
provide a transformer which is 
easy and cheap to manufacture and to assemble.  
 The object of the invention is solved by a transformer 
according to one of claims 1 to 3.

illustrated in Fig. 10. Referring to Fig. 1, a conventional bobbin will 
first be described for a better understanding of this 
invention. The conventional bobbin comprises a sleeve 
21, a plurality of divider plates 23, and first and 
second end plates 25 and 27. The sleeve 21 has a sleeve 
internal surface 28 which defines a sleeve perforation. 
The divider plates 23 are attached to the sleeve with a 
space left between two adjacent ones of the divider 
plates 23 and with the divider plates 23 perpendicular to 
the sleeve 21. The first and the
