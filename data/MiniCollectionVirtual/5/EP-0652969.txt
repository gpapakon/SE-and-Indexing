<DESCRIPTION>
In the production of polyester polymers especially those 
which are microbially produced the particle sizes of the 
polymers may be too small for convenient handling; for example 
in the course of production processes it may be necessary to 
separate such particles from aqueous liquid media. Such 
separations are more difficult if the particles are small than 
if they are large. EP-A-0 479 043 discloses a process for the production of 
polyhydroxyalkanoate flake from the cell material of a 
microorganism. The polyhydroxyalkanoate is extracted 
from an aqueous cell suspension by the addition of an 
organic solvent therefor, which solvent is 
water-insoluble and has a boiling point of less than 
100°C. This extraction mixture is then stirred, the 
aqueous phase containing the undissolved cell material 
is separated from the organic phase containing the polyhydroxyalkanoate 
and the organic phase is injected into 
hot water, so that the dissolved polyhydroxyalkanoate 
precipitates and the organic solvent evaporates. The 
precipitated polyhydroxyalkanoate flake is then stirred 
in hot water for 15 to 60 minutes at a temperature of 
e.g. 80°C. Surprisingly we have found that polyesters, especially 
those which are microbially produced, for example polymers and 
copolymers of hydroxyalkanoic acids especially polymers and 
copolymers of hydroxybutyric acid are capable of surprisingly 
rapid agglomeration at temperatures substantially below their 
peak melting points when in suspension in a liquid medium 
producing particles well suited to solid liquid separation with 
little molecular weight loss. This invention comprises a process in which polyester 
particles, in suspension in a liquid medium in which if such 
medium comprises matter derived from microbial cells the said 
matter other than polyester has been at least partly chemically 
degraded, are agglomerated by maintaining the suspension at a 
temperature in excess of 80°C and preferably in excess of 90°C 
for example in excess of 100°C and preferably 30 to 80°C and 
more preferably 40 to 70°C below the peak melting point of the 
polyester as determined by differential scanning calorimetry 
for a time sufficient to cause substantial agglomeration, the process 
being carried out in the substantial absence of any solvent for the 
polyester particles. Suitable temperatures in the case of polymers of 
hydroxybutyric acid, for example copolymers of hydroxybutyric 
and hydroxyvaleric acid containing up to 25%, for example 5 to 
20% of hydroxyvaleric acid

<CLAIMS>
A process in which polyester particles, in suspension in a 
liquid medium in which, if such medium comprises matter derived 

from microbial cells, the said matter other than polyester has 
been at least partly chemically degraded, are agglomerated by 

maintaining the suspension at a temperature in excess of 80°C 
and preferably in excess of 90°C for example in excess of 100°C 

and preferably 30 to 80°C and more preferably 40 to 70°C below 
the peak melting point of the polyester as determined by 

differential scanning calorimetry for a time sufficient to 
cause substantial agglomeration, the process being carried out 

in the substantial absence of any solvent for the polyester 
particles. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 in which one polyester is 
microbially produced. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 in which the 
polyester is a copolymer of hydroxybutyric acid and 

hydroxyvaleric acid containing up to 25% of hydroxy-valeric 
acid residues, the balance being substantially all 

hydroxybutyric acid residues. 
A process as claimed in Claim 3 which is carried out at a 
temperature of 120 to 160°C. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
pa
rticles of which substantially all are smaller in diameter 
than 1µm are agglomerated to produce agglomerates of weight 

average diameter of at least 50µm. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
aggregates have a porosity greater than 0.7.

carried out under turbulent conditions. 
A process as claimed in Claim 7 in which the process is 
carried out by direct injection of steam into a flowing stream 

of the suspension or whilst stirring.  
 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
liquid medium comprises water. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
agglomerated particles are separated from the liquid medium by 

filtration. 
A process as claimed in Claim 10 in which the separated 
agglomerated particles are further washed optionally by 

resuspending them in a medium comprising water and/or 
chemically treated optionally while resuspended, and the 

particles are recovered.
