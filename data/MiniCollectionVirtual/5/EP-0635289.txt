<ABSTRACT>
The invention is for an automatic dice game consisting of a frame 
(1), a body (4) which can rotate about a shaft (3) mounted in the 

frame, a means of propulsion (5-6-7-8) for turning the body, a 
number of dice bodies (11) placed in the body with code carriers 

(14) and dice symbols, and a code reader (15) for reading the code 
carriers and installed between the frame (1) and the rotating body 

(4). The rotating body (4) is provided with a dice bed (10) for 
catching and locating the dice bodies next to one another (11), and 

the automatic dice game is provided with an optical sensor (20) and 
a number of detection strips (19) for placing the rotating body in 

the zero position and for determining the direction of rotation of 
the rotating body (4), with an interface unit (17) for converting 

the signals received from the code reader (15) into coded figures, 
and with a control unit with control card (18) for receiving the 

coded figures, for giving a stop signal to the means of propulsion 
of the rotating body (4) and for comparing the coded figures 

obtained with the predetermined winning combination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is for an automatic dice game consisting of a rotating 
drum containing a number of dice which are visible to the player 
and which are provided with code carriers which work in 
conjunction with a code reader and an interface unit for reading the 
dice symbols, when the drum comes to a standstill, after which this 
information is compared with a predetermined winning combination. An automatic game is known from U.K. patent 1,180,560 consisting 
of a frame, a body or basket with two dice beds and 
capable of rotating on a shaft bearing 
in the frame, a driving means for turning the body or 
basket, a number of dice bodies with code carriers and dice 
symbols and placed in the body, a code reader for reading the code 
carriers and installed between the frame and the rotating body or 
basket. This automatic game has, however, the disadvantage that the game 
proceeds relatively slowly. In order to remedy this disadvantage and significantly limit the 
duration of the game as well as to shake the dice bodies thoroughly, an 
automatic dice game in accordance with the main characteristic of 
the invention has been realized which has in principal the 
characteristics described in claim 1 of the description given below. By way of example but without in any way being exhaustive, a  
 
more detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the automatic 
dice game according to the invention is given below. This 
description refers to the attached drawing where: 
fig. 1 shows a front elevation of the automatic dice game; fig. 2 shows a side elevation of same; fig. 3 shows a rear elevation; fig. 4 shows a dice used in the game; fig. 5 shows a section along the line V-V in fig. 4; figures 6 and 7 show a block diagram and flow chart of the 
automatic dice game respectively. In these figures can be seen a frame 1 which by preference slopes 
backwards in which an axle 3 is mounted on ball bearings 2 to 
which, a by preference octagonal drum 4 is fitted. A gearwheel 5 is 
also mounted on said axis over which a toothed belt 6 runs which 
likewise runs over a toothed pinion 7 fixed on the shaft of an 
electrical motor 8 mounted on afore-mentioned frame 1. The front 
of the drum is covered by a transparent wall 9 consisting of one or 
more parts which swing open. A dice bed 10 is fitted in the drum 
in which te dice bodies 11 of several dice are caught and positioned 
next to one another when the drum 4 comes to rest. Furthermore 
at least one cord 12 is stretched across and inside the drum in 
order to give

<CLAIMS>
Automatic dice game consisting of a frame (1), a body (4) with 
dice bed and which can rotate about a shaft (3) mounted in the frame, 

a driving mechanism (5-6-7-8) for turning the body, a number of dice 
bodies (11) placed in the body with code carriers (14) and dice 

symbols, and a code reader (15) for reading the code carriers and 
installed between the frame (1) and the rotating body (4), 

characterized in that the dice bed (10) has a recess provided inside 
the casing of the rotating body (4) for catching and locating the dice 

bodies (11) next to one another, and that the automatic dice game is 
provided with an optical sensor (20) fitted on the frame (1) and a 

number of detection strips (19) fitted on the rotating body (4) and 
operating in conjunction with the optical sensor for giving a signal 

to the driving mechanism (5-6-7-8) of the rotating body (4) in order 
to put this into the zero position, to determine the direction of 

rotation of the rotating body (4) and to convert the rotational 
movement of the rotating body into a slowed back and forth motion. 
Automatic game in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
the rotating body (4) with the dice bed (10) consists of a polygonal, 

preferably octagonal rotating drum (4) with a transparent wall (9) and 
two door panels which can be swung open. 
Automatic game in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that 
there is at least one cord (12) stretched in drum (4) so that during 

the rotation of the drum an additional tumbling motion is imparted to 
the dice bodies (11). 
Automatic game in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
it is provided with a coin test unit (21), a button (22) for starting 

the driving mechanism (5-6-7-8) of the rotating body (4), a unit (23) 
for indicating the winning combinations of the dice game, a payment 

unit (24) for paying out the price in the event of win, a unit (25) 
for converting main voltage into low voltage, a unit (26) for 

accepting coins, a unit (27) for limiting the number of rotations of  
 

the rotating body (4), a unit (28) for slowing the speed of revolution 
of the rotating body (4) and a unit (29) for verifying the codes 

received by the code reader (15) and an interface unit (17).
