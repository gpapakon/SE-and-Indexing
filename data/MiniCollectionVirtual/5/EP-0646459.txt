<ABSTRACT>
A series of H banknote sheets, for example 100 sheets, is first checked for misprints and the banknote positions of each sheet which have misprints are stored in a computer. The sheets of this series then pass a numbering machine (4) having freely programmable numbering units which are controlled by the computer. Numbering takes place in such a way that all the perfect banknote prints within the sheet series, excluding the misprints, acquire a continuous number sequence, the number sequence of H banknotes in one and the same banknote position being a continuation of the number sequence of the H banknotes in an adjacent banknote position. The next series of H sheets acquires the consecutive number sequence. After numbering, sheet stacks (FH), each with H sheets, are formed, these stacks are cut into banknote stacks (W), and these banknote stacks, ordered according to consecutive numbering, are fed to a separating-out and bundling device (9), in which the misprints are removed and, in each case, H successive perfect banknotes are combined to form a bundle (WB) having a complete number sequnce. Ten bundles in each case are packaged into a banknote package (P).

Process for processing sheets of notes having a 
fixed number N of note prints, arranged on each sheet 

in transversal rows and longitudinal rows, to form 
bundles of notes (WB) from numbered individual notes of 

value and to form packs of notes of value (P), which 
contain a given number of bundles of notes and in which 

all the notes of value have a consecutive, complete 
sequence of numbers, in which process, after 

registration of the misprints established on them, the 
sheets of notes run through a numbering machine (4), in 

which only the satisfactory note prints are numbered, 
excluding the misprints, and in which process, after 

the cutting of the sheets of notes, the misprints are 
segregated, characterised in that the distribution of 

the misprints (X) on each sheet of a sequence of at 
least H sheets is established and stored before their 

numbering, that a sequence of H successive sheets is 
numbered as a function of this stored misprint 

distribution in such a way that all the satisfactory 
note prints of this sequence receive a consecutive 

sequence of numbers, the satisfactory note prints which 
have the same note position on successive sheets being 

consecutively numbered and all the sequences of numbers 
of the H note prints in adjacently lying note positions 

of the same row completing a consecutive sequence of 
numbers, the sequences of numbers of the note prints in 

all the note positions of a row continuing the 
sequences of numbers of the note prints in the note 

positions of a neighbouring row, and the next sequence 
of H sheets receiving the subsequent sequence of 

numbers, in that at the output of the numbering machine  
 

(4) stacks of sheets (FH) having H sheets each are 
formed, these stacks of sheets being cut into stacks of 

strips (S) and these stacks of strips being cut into 
stacks of notes (W) and the stacks of notes occurring 

one after the other in rows are successively sent 
through at least one segregation and bundling device 

(9), in which the misprints (X) are removed and in each 
case H successive satisfactory notes are combined to 

form a bundle (WB) having a complete sequence of 
numbers, bundles following one another having notes 

with successive sequences of numbers. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the numbering machine (4) used 

has freely programmable printing units, which units are 
programmed on the basis of the known distribution of 

the misprints (X) in the sequence of sheets to be 
numbered, in such a way that, after the cutting of a 

stack of sheets (FH) with H sheets, stacks of notes (W) 
are produced which, laid one on top of the other, form 

a connected sequence of numbers, the misprints having 
been skipped during the numbering. 
Process for processing sheets of notes having a 
fixed number N of note prints, arranged on each sheet 

in transversal rows and longitudinal rows, to form 
bundles of notes (WB) from numbered individual notes of 

value and to form packs of notes (P), which contain a 
given number of bundles of notes and in which all the 

notes have a consecutive, complete sequence of numbers, 
in which process, after registration of the misprints 

established on them, the sheets of notes run through a 
numbering machine (4), in which only the satisfactory  

 
note prints are numbered, excluding the misprints, and 

in which process, after the cutting of the sheets of 
notes, the misprints are segregated, characterised in 

that the distribution of the misprints (X) on each 
sheet of a sequence of at least H sheets is established 

and stored before their numbering, in that the 
numbering units of the numbering machine (4) are 

programmed in such a way that each sheet is divided for 
numbering into a particular number of subregions (A, B, 

C), in that a sequence of H consecutive sheets are 
numbered as a function of this stored misprint 

distribution in such a way that all the satisfactory 
note prints of this sequence from the same subregion 

(A, B, C) of the sheet receive a continuous sequence of 
numbers, the satisfactory notes of value which have the 

same position on successive sheets being continuously 
numbered and all the sequences of numbers of the H note 

prints in all note positions of the same subregion (A, 
B, C) completing a consecutive sequence of numbers, in 

that the next sequence of H sheets receiving the 
following sequence of numbers in the same subregions, 

in that at the output of the numbering machine (4) 
stacks of sheets (FH) each having H sheets ar
e formed, 
these stacks of sheets being cut into stacks of strips 

(S) and these stacks of strips being cut into stacks of 
notes (W) which, laid one on top of the other, would 

form a connected sequence of numbers, the misprints 
having been skipped during the numbering, in that the 

stacks of notes (W), originating from the same stack of 
sheets and occurring one after the other in rows of the 

various subregions, run through as many parallel-operating 
segregation and bundling devices (9A, 9B, 9C) 

as there are subregions, the misprints (X) being  
 

segregated in each of said devices (9A,9B,9C) and H 
consecutive perfect notes of value being combined to 

form a bundle (WB) with a complete sequence of numbers, 
bundles following one another having notes of value 

with successive sequences of numbers. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the misprints are provided with 

an invalidation marking. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, when establishing the misprint 

distribution, the sheets are provided with an 
identification mark and, before numbering, pass a 

reading device (2), which reads these marks and checks 
the assignment of the sheets to the stored misprint 

distribution. 
A process for processing sheets of notes having 
a fixed number N of note prints, arranged on each sheet 

in transversal rows and longitudinal rows, to form 
bundles of notes (WB) from numbered individual notes of 

value and to form packs of notes (P), which contain a 
particular number of bundles of notes and in which all 

the notes have a consecutive, complete sequence of 
numbers, the sheets passing through a numbering machine 

once the sheets containing misprints have been 
segregated, in which the note prints of all the sheets 

are so numbered, that note prints having the same note 
position on successive sheets are consecutively 

numbered, the H numbered sheets of note prints being 
cut into stacks of strips (S) and these stacks of 

strips being cut into stacks of notes, characterised in  
 

that all the N x H note prints of a sequence of H 
sheets receive a consecutive sequence of numbers, all 

the sequences of numbers of the H note prints in 
adjacently lying note positions of the same row 

completing a consecutive sequence of numbers, the 
sequence of numbers of the note prints in all positions 

of a row continuing the sequence of numbers of the note 
prints of a neighbouring row, and the next sequence of 

H sheets receiving the following sequence of numbers 
such that the bundles of notes (WB) occurring one after 

the other in rows of a sequence of H sheets after 
cutting have consecutively numbered notes and the 

bundles of notes occurring one after the other in rows 
of the subsequent sequence of H sheets have notes with 

the subsequent sequence of numbers.
