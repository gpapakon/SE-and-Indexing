<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for making a magnetic toy 
fish. The method comprises conformally joining two 

premolded plastic half-shell sections 10a, 10b 
containing a magnetic member 26 and a counterweight 

34,36, and applying sonar energy across the joints to 
permanently join the half-shell sections 10a, 10b 

together and form the fish.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to toy fish of the 
type used in marine display devices, and is particularly 
related to magnetic toy fish which may be freely 
suspended in a liquid medium, and which may be activated 
to simulate the swimming patterns of a natural fish in a 
liquid habitat. More specifically, this invention is 
concerned with a method of making a magnetic toy fish 
which is buoyant, and which exhibits structural integrity 
without deterioration or disintegration due to prolonged 
use of the fish. In the aforementioned copending application serial 
number 08/041,566, there is described a marine display 
device which is filled with water and which comprises a 
magnetic toy fish freely suspended in the water and moves 
about therein, much in the same way a natural fish swims 
in an aquatic habitat. The swimming pattern of the  
 
magnetic toy fish described in said application is 
facilitated and controlled by one or more rotatable 
magnets conveniently disposed in the display device to 
interact with magnets in the toy fish thereby producing 
different magnetic fields with corresponding different 
swimming patterns of the toy fish in the liquid. The toy 
fish disclosed is said application is formed by 
adhesively bonding together two half shells molded of a 
suitable synthetic resin. The toy fish also comprises an 
air vessel such as a blow molded float which acts as an 
air bladder in order to impart buoyancy to the toy fish. 
Also disposed within the toy fish, below the air bladder 
is a magnet which, together with the air bladder, are so 
constructed and arranged as to provide proper balance 
between buoyancy of the air bladder and the weight of the 
magnet in the toy fish in order to insure that the fish 
remain freely suspended in the liquid at all times. Magnetic toy fishes are not new and have been known 
for some time. One such toy fish, for example, has been 
described in United States Patent No. 2,509,785. The 
fish described therein comprises a buoyant means placed 
above the horizontal axis of the fish body so that when 
the fish is placed in water, it can float upright. The  
 
fish body is stamped from a thin plastic sheet and a 
magnetic rivet member is affixed to the upper body of 
the fish so that the fish can be moved by magnetic 
means. Another magnetic toy fish is described in 
United States Patent No. 3,239,956. This patent 
describes a marine display apparatus in which an 
animated toy fish containing a magnet is freely 
suspended in a liquid medium and is caused to

<CLAIMS>
A method of constructing a toy fish (10) 
formed from two preformed half-s
hell sections (10a, 
10b) with each half-shell section defining one half of 

the fish structure, which comprises: bringing said 
preformed half-shell sections into alignment with each 

other and sealing said two preformed half-shell 
sections to form the toy fish, said method being 

characterised by said sealing being carried out by 
applying sonar energy to the half-shell sections across 

their entire lengths, at a frequency of from about 
18,000HZ to about 20,000Hz, a pressure of from about 

103.4 kN/m
2
 to about 137.9 kN/m
2
, and a welding time of 
from about 0.5 second to about 0.9 second to effect the 

seal between said half-shell sections. 
A method as in claim 1 and including the 
further step of discontinuing the application of sonar 

energy and holding the sealed sections (10a, 10b) 
together for a period of from about 1.0 second to about 

2.0 second. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein each of said 
half-shells (10a, 10b) is made of a sonar-sealable 

plastic. 
A method as in claim 2 wherein each of said 
half-shells (10a, 10b) is made of a sonar-sealable 

plastic. 
A method as in claim 3 wherein each of said 
sonar-sealable plastic is acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 

resin.  
 
A method as in claim 4 wherein each of said 
sonar-sealable plastic is acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 

resin. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein said fish (10) 
comprises a magnetic member (26) and a counterweight 

(34, 36). 
A method as in claim 2 wherein said fish (10) 
comprises a magnetic member (26) and a counterweight 

(34, 36). 
A method as in claim 3 wherein said fish (10) 
comprises a magnetic member (26) and a counterweight 

(34, 36). 
A method as in claim 4 wherein said fish (10) 
comprises a magnetic member (26) and a counterweight 

(34, 36). 
A method as in claim 5 wherein said fish (10) 
comprises a magnetic member (26) and a counterweight 

(34, 36). 
A method as in claim 6 wherein said fish (10) 
comprises a magnetic member (26) and a counterweight 

(34, 36).
