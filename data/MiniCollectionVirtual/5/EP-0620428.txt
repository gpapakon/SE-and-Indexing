<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to methods for compression of 
listmode data from instruments that record multiparametric 

data from many events. It is particularly useful in the 
storage and analysis of data from a flow cytometer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for storing
multiparametric data, and more particularly relates to a
method for compressing multiparametric data obtained from a
flow or image cytometer in list mode.Particle analysis generally comprises the analysis of
cells, nuclei, chromosomes and other particles for the
purpose of identifying the particles as members of different
populations and/or sorting the particles into different
populations. This type of analysis includes automated
analysis by means of image and flow cytometry. In either
instance, the particle, such as a cell, may be labeled with
one or more markers and then examined for the presence or
absence of one or more such markers. In the case of a cell,
such as a leukocyte, tumor cell or microorganism, the marker
can be directed to molecules on the cell surface or to
molecules in the cytoplasm. Examination of a cell's
physical characteristics (such as size and granularity), as
well as the marker(s) it is labeled with can provide
additional information which can be useful in identifying
the population to which a cell belongs.Cytometry comprises a well known methodology using
multiparameter data for identifying and distinguishing
between different cell types in a sample. For example, the
sample may be drawn from a variety of biological fluids such
as blood, lymph or urine, or may be derived from suspensions
of cells from tissues such as brain, lymph node, colon,
lung, breast, kidney or liver. In a flow cytometer, cells
are passed substantially one at a time through one or more
sensing regions where in each region each cell is 
illuminated by an energy source. The energy source
generally comprises an illumination means that emits light
of a single wavelength such as that provided by a laser
(e.g., He/Ne or argon) or a mercury arc lamp with
appropriate filters. Light at 488nm is a presently
preferred wavelength of emission.In series with a sensing region, multiple light
collection means, such as photomultiplier tubes, are used to
separately record light that would pass through each cell
(generally referred to as forward light scatter), light that
is reflected orthogonal to the direction of the flow of the
cells through the sensing region (generally referred to as
orthogonal or side light scatter) and one or more light
collection means to separately fluorescent light that may be
emitted from the cell, if it is labeled with fluorescent
marker(s), as it passes through the sensing region and is
illuminated by the energy source. Each of forward light
scatter

<CLAIMS>
A method for compressing multiparameter event
vectors comprising the steps of:


a) transforming event vectors to holographic form;
b) sorting of the list of holographic event vectors;
c) difference coding and run-length encoding of the
sorted list;
d) difference and run-length decoding;
d) randomly scrambling event-order; and
e) transforming holographic event vectors back to
original form.
The method of claim 1 wherein the data is derived
from a sample analyzed by means of flow cytometry.
