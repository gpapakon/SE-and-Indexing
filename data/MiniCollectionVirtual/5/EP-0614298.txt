<ABSTRACT>
For a data communications system, in particular in motor vehicles, with a BUS structure, the insertion of a protective circuit between the data line and the reference potential is proposed which, even if an earth connection is uncoupled in one of a plurality of subscriber devices, maintains communication between the remaining subscribers. The protective circuit is at the same time secure against destruction in the event of a short-circuit.

<CLAIMS>
Data-communication system with a data line implemented as a double line (L, H)
of a symmetrical bus system, and a load impedance (101, 102), positioned between

the two lines of the double line, having a neutral point, for data-signals, at a central
tap, characterized in that

A protection circuit (SCH) is placed between the central tap and the reference
voltage, whereby,


no output current flows, through the protection circuit, between the data-line
and the reference potential, in a range 'a', below a threshold voltage (th) which

is above the normal voltage of the data-line,
in a range 'b', below a critical voltage value (c), there is a sharp rise in output
current (I) with increase in voltage, and
in a range 'c', above the critical voltage value (c), the output current (I) is
limited by the protection circuit (SCH).
Data-communication system in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that a
capacitor (103) is arranged in parallel with the protection circuit (SCH).
Data-communication system in accordance with either claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that this is a CAN bus system in a star-configuration, and the protection circuit

is connected in at the neutral point (P), at the star-node (10).
Data-communications system in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the protection circuit contains a constant current source with a

transistor (111), in which the basic circuit is that of a zener diode (114) and a
resistor (113) connected in series, by means of which the protection circuit

functions substantially as a constant-voltage adjuster, up to the maximum current
at which the functioning of the diode collapses.
