<ABSTRACT>
In this method, of the type with a pump (17), the variable delivery rate of pressurised gas is obtained by altering the flow rate of liquid to be vaporised in the heat-exchange line (9) and the vaporisation pressure of the liquid.

Process for producing at least one main constituent of
the air under pressure at a variable gaseous flow rate, of

the type in which the constituent is withdrawn in liquid
form from an air distillation apparatus (12), this liquid

is brought to a vaporization pressure above the pressure at
which it is withdrawn, and the liquid is vaporized at the

vaporization pressure by heat exchange (in 9) with a
heating fluid at a high pressure, characterized in that,

when the demand for the said gaseous constituent falls, its
flow rate is adjusted by modifying the flow rate of the

liquid to be vaporized and the said vaporization pressure
and the flow rate of the heating fluid is reduced so as to

establish the materials balance and the high pressure of
the heating fluid is reduced to maintain the same

temperature difference between the heating fluid and the
liquid which is vaporizing.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
gas resulting from vaporization is compressed to the

production pressure (in 20).
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the
said modification is carried out so as to enable the

compressor (20) of the resulting gas to follow its
characteristic curve (1).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that, in order to carry out the said

modification, the liquid to be vaporized is throttled in a
variable manner (in 18).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that, in order to carry out the said 

modification, the liquid conveyed through the vaporizing
heat exchanger (9) is pumped at a variable speed (in 17).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that, in order to carry out the said

modification, a constant flow of the liquid is pumped and
is returned at a variable flow rate (in 24) to the

distillation apparatus (12), the remainder of the liquid
being vaporized.
Plant for producing at least one main constituent of
the air under pressure at a variable flow rate, of the type

comprising an air distillation apparatus (12), means for
withdrawing a liquid from this apparatus, means (17) for

increasing the pressure of the liquid withdrawn to a
vaporization pressure, a compressor (10) for heating fluid,

and a heat exchanger (9) for vaporizing the liquid at the
said vaporization pressure by heat exchange with the

heating fluid at high pressure, characterized in that it
includes means (18;24) for adjusting the flow rate of the

liquid to be vaporized and the said vaporization pressure
and means (10) for reducing the flow rate of the heating

fluid so as to establish the materials balance and for
reducing the high pressure of the heating fluid to maintain

the same temperature difference between the heating fluid
and the fluid which is vaporizing, when the demand for the

said constituent falls.
Plant according to claim 7, characterized in that it
includes a compressor (20) for bringing the gas resulting

from the said vaporization to the production pressure.
Plant according to claim 8, characterized in that the
compressor (20) has no variable turbine blades at its inlet

and/or is driven by a constant speed motor. 
Plant according to any one of claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that it includes a constant speed pump

(17) connected upstream from the distillation apparatus
(12) and downstream from the passages for vaporizing the

liquid of the heat exchanger (9), and in that the means of
adjustment include a throttle valve (18) mounted in the

delivery pipe from this pump.
Plant according to any one of claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that it includes a pump driven by a

variable speed motor, connected upstream from the
distillation apparatus (12) and downstream from the

passages for vaporizing the liquid of the heat exchanger
(9) .
Plant according to claim 10 or 11, characterized in
that it includes a return pipe, equipped with a flow rate

adjusting valve (24), connecting the delivery from the pump
(17) to the distillation apparatus (12).
