characterized in that an aqueous solution of a heparin 
fraction obtained by nitrous depolymerization is 

subjected to ultraviolet radiation. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that an aqueous solution of a heparin fraction 

obtained by nitrous depolymerization, of concentration 
5-15 % m/V, is exposed under an ultraviolet radiation 

system at a wavelength of 180 to 350 nm, at a 
temperature of between 5°C and 50°C, the pH of the 

solution being between 3 and 8. 
Method according to one of Claims 7 and 8, 
characterized in that exposure takes place at 254 nm, 

at a temperature of between 15°C and 35°C and at a pH 
of between 5 and 8. 
Method for the preparation of a low-molecular-weight

sodium is treated with hydrochloric acid and an amount 

of an alkali metal nitrite of 3.5 to 4 % by weight
