<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for preparing certain substituted
thiazolidinedione and oxazolidinedione derivatives.European Patent Application, Publication Number 0 306228 discloses
interalia certain thiazolidinedione derivatives of formula (A):

or a tautomeric form thereof and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof, and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein:
Aa represents a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic heterocyclyl group;Ra represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an acyl group, an aralkyl
group, wherein the aryl moiety may be substituted or unsubstituted, or a
substituted or unsubstituted aryl group;Rb and Rc each represent hydrogen or Rb and Rc together represent a
bond; Ab represents a benzene ring having in total up to five substituents; andn' represents an integer in the range of from 2 to 6.EP 0306228 also discloses a process for-converting compounds of formula
(A), in particular a process for reducing the benzylidene double bond of
compounds of formula (A) wherein Rb and Rc together represent a bond to
provide compounds of formula (A) wherein Rb and Rc each represent
hydrogen.Particular reduction methods disclosed in EP 0306228 are catalytic
reduction methods and metal/solvent reducing methods. It has now been discovered that the reduction of the benzylidene double
bond of the compound of formula (A) may be effected by a reductase
enzyme from a microorganism, in particular from a yeast microorganism,
and surprisingly that the said reduction proceeds in a structure specific
manner. The reduction is also capable of proceeding in an
enantioselective manner.Certain of the compounds obtained in the process are novel and are
indicated to show good blood-glucose lowering activity and are therefore of
potential use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of hyperglycaemia and
are of particular use in the treatment of Type II diabetes.These compounds are also indicated to be of potential use for the
treatment and/or prophylaxis of other diseases including hyperlipidaemia,
hypertension, cardiovascular disease and certain eating disorders.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a
compound of formula (I):

or a tautomeric form thereof and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein:
T is, as defined in claim 1
and T1 is O or S;which process comprises, treating a compound of formula (II):
 
or a tautomeric form thereof and/or a salt thereof and/or a solvate
