<DESCRIPTION>
It has long been known that compounds which include a salicylic acid structure
coupled by a reductive cleavable bridge -N=N- (=-A-) to a ring position in a
benzenesulphonic acid which, in turn, is amidated at the amine group of an amine-substituted
heterocyclic ring which includes conjugated double bonds can exhibit a
therapeutic effect against ulterative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases
that are considered to be autoimmune. See for instance Askelöf et al, US-A 2 396
145, Agback and Lindblom, US-A-3 915 951, T. Pullar: Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol., vol.
30, pages 501-510 (1990), I.G. Tumanova, Ia A. Sigidin: Ter-Arkh., vol. 59, pages
80-83 (1987), S. Pacheco, K. Hillier, C.L. Smith, Brazilian J. Med. Biol. Res., vol.
23, pages 1323-34 (1990) and C. Astbury, J. Hill, J.R. Lowe, D. Campbell, H.A.
Bird, British J. Rheumatology, vol. 29, pages 465-467 (1990). Autoimmune diseases
are described and exemplified by, inter alia, I. Roitt, J. Brostoff, D. Male:
Immunology, 2nd ed., 1989.The best known compound possessing the aforesaid therapeutic effect is
sulfasalazine. Although analogues of sulfasalazine have been described, none has yet
resulted in an accepted drug.Sulfasalazine is clinically effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as
for instance rheumatoid arthritis, ulterative colitis, ankylosis spondylitis, reactive
arthritis, psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis. See for instance D.R. Porter and H.A.
Capell: Bailliers Clin. Rheumatol., vol. 4, pages 535-551 (1990),
M.B. Ferraz, P. Tugwell, C.H. Goldsmith and E. Atra: J. Rheumatol., vol. 17, pages
1482-1486 (1990), A.K. Gupta, C.N. Ellis, M.T. Siegel, E.A. Duell, C.E.M.
Griffiths, T.A. Hamilton, B.J. Nickoloff and J.J. Voorhees: Arch. Dermatol, vol. 126,
pages 487-493 (1990), G. Watkinson: Drugs, vol. 32: suppl. 1, pages 1-11 (1986).The drugs mostly prescribed in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are the
antiinflammatory drugs, so-called NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs).
These drugs are considered to act against the symptoms of the disease. On the other
hand, sulfasalazine is classified as a disease-modifying drug. Also belonging to the
same group of drugs are gold salt, penicillamine, chloroquine and the
immunosuppressive drugs methotrexate, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, all
having radically divergent structures. A number of pharmalogical model systems are available for evaluating drugs which
are potentially usable for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. One of the most
important properties of the NSAIDs in
