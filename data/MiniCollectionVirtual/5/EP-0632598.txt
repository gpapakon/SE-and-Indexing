<ABSTRACT>
Encoder for converting a thermometric or circular type signal including a set (10) of n Exclusive OR gates (X1, Xi...Xn) and an encoding matrix (12) with n rows (1...n) and a plurality of pairs of columns (13-14, 15-16...) for a differential output (23-24, 25-26...) of one bit of the binary signal, in which matrix row/column coupling is performed by a transistor (T). According to the invention, a pair of pseudo-columns (13-14) of zero order is coupled to the rows in a way which is comparable to the coupling of the pair of columns (15-16) of order 1 but by applying a circular shift for the rank of the rows (rows of rank i of the pseudo-columns of zero order, coupled like the rows of rank (i modulo n) + 1 of the columns of order 1). The zero-order bit [Bo] is obtained at the output of an additional Exclusive OR gate (35), the inputs of which respectively receive the logic signal [Bo

An encoder for the conversion of a digital input signal defined as a code
of thermometric or cyclic type, each bit of which is applied to an input of the encoder,

so as to obtain a binary-encoded output signal, which encoder includes a set (10) of
n successive Exclusive OR gates (X1...Xi...Xn), with two inputs and one output, each

Exclusive OR gate (Xi) having an input connected to an input of the gate (Xi-1),
(Xi+1) of neighbouring rank as well as to an input (Ji) of the encoder, and includes an

encoding matrix (12) with n rows at input and a plurality of pairs of columns (13-14),
(15-16)... at output, each of the n successive rows being connected to an output of one

of the successive Exclusive OR gates (Xi), each of the columns being linked to a
reference voltage terminal (VEE) via a current source (S) and the columns of one pair

delivering a differential output (23-24),(25-26) for one bit [Bi] of the binary output

signal, in which encoding matrix active coupling between a specified row and a
specified column is effected, when required, by a transistor (T), the base of which is

connected to said specified row, the emitter of which is connected to said specified
column and the collector of which is connected to a supply voltage terminal (Vcc),

characterized in that the encoding matrix (12) includes a pair of columns respectively
called pseudo-column (14) of order zero and complementary pseudo-column (13) of

order zero, the row/column coupling of which is derived respectively through cyclic
shifting from the row/column coupling of the pair of columns (15-16) of order one,

namely : for a row of rank i of the pseudo-column of order zero, there is applied a
coupling identical to that of the row of rank (i modulo n) + 1 of the column of order

one, similarly for the row of rank i of the complementary pseudo-column of order zero,
there is applied a coupling identical to that of the row of rank (i modulo n) + 1 of the

complementary column of order one,

and in that the encoder includes an additional Exclusive OR gate (35) with two inputs,
one of which receives a logic signal ([B0*]
)corresponding to the output from the pair of
pseudo-columns (13-14) of order zero and the other of which receives a logic signal

([B1]) corresponding to the output of the pair of columns (15-16) of order one, this 

additional Exclusive OR gate delivering at output the bit ([B0]) of order zero of the

binary output signal.
An encoder as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that each of the pairs
of columns of the encoding matrix is followed by a differential amplifier (30,31...) of

sufficient gain to force the signal level at its output to take one of two predetermined
logic levels, in the presence of a simple decision error at the output of the set (10) of

Exclusive OR gates.
An encoder as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that in the
encoding matrix, each transistor (T) producing a row/column active coupling is

furnished with an emitter resistor (Re), the value of which is chosen in such a way that
the differential voltage level of the output from one pair of columns, in the presence of

a simple decision error at the output of the Exclusive OR gates, is rendered comparable
with the differential voltage level produced in the absence of such an error.
An analogue/digital converter, characterized in that it includes an encoder
as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3.
