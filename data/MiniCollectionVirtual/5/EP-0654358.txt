<ABSTRACT>
A label printer comprises a supporting frame having 
a pair of side plates (14, 15) facing each other. A 

print head (39) and a platen roller (24) are arranged 
between the side plates. Above the print head is 

arranged a ribbon supply device (45) for running a 
transfer ribbon between the print head and the platen 

roller. The ribbon supply device includes a ribbon unit 
(46) supported on a supporting mechanism (44), and a 

ribbon drive section (47) attached to the side plate so 
as to drive the ribbon unit. The supporting mechanism 

includes a fixed arm (43) fixed to one of the side 
plates, and a slider (91) mounted on the fixed arm. The 

slider supports the ribbon unit thereon and slidable 
between a first position wherein the ribbon unit engages 

the ribbon drive section and a second position wherein 
the ribbon unit is situated outside the supporting 

frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer
printer, such as a label printer for printing item
names, bar codes, etc. on labels, and more particularly,
to a transfer printer in which a transfer ribbon in contact
with printing paper is heated by means of a print
head to transfer ink on the ribbon to the paper, thereby
effecting printing.Transfer printers are disclosed in e.g. US-A-4 632 585, US-A-4
673 304 and DE-A-3 421 925.A transfer printer, e.g., a label printer for
printing item names, bar codes, etc. on labels, comprises
a printing section which includes a platen roller
and a line thermal head adapted to be pressed against
the roller. A supply shaft and a take-up shaft for a
transfer ribbon are located over the printing section.
When the take-up shaft is rotated by means of a motor
and the like, the transfer ribbon is fed out from the
supply shaft, transported past a guide shaft and the
printing section, and taken up by means of the take-up
shaft. The supply shaft is connected with a load
mechanism. A desired back tension is applied to the
transfer ribbon by damping the rotation of the supply
shaft by means of the load mechanism.Conventionally, attaching and detaching operations
for replacing the transfer ribbon must be performed in
a narrow space within the printer body, while avoiding
interfering with other components, so that the working
efficiency is not very high. Thereupon, a printer of a novel design has recently
been developed to facilitate the replacement of the
transfer ribbon. In this printer, a supply shaft and a
take-up shaft wound with a ribbon are housed in a casing
to form a modular structure or unit, which is removably
mounted in the body of the printer. According to this
arrangement, the transfer ribbon can be replaced outside
the printer by removing the unit from the printer body.If the transfer ribbon and the supply and take-up
shafts are combined into the unit, the replacement of
the ribbon itself can be facilitated indeed. Nevertheless,
the ribbon unit must be attached to or detached
from the printer in the narrow space within the printer
body, so that the working efficiency is not satisfactory.
It is hard, therefore, to utilize the ribbon
unit with high efficiency.In the ribbon unit, each of the supply shaft and
the take-up shaft includes a ribbon set shaft and a
cylindrical core removably mounted on the set shaft, and
the transfer ribbon as an expendable is wound on the
core.A core fixing portion is formed on one end portion
of the ribbon set shaft, and a core stopper
