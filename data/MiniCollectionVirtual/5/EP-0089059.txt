<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic detector for the angle, position or speed of 
rotation of a rotating body or the rectinear position, distance 

or speed of a rectinearly moving body is used opposite to a 
magnetic recording medium. The magnetic detector includes 

a plurality of elongated stripe-shaped magnetoresistive 
elements (R₁ to R₄; R₁₁ to R₈₂) juxtaposed on a non-magnetic 

substrate. Bridge output terminals (f to i; II to IX) are 
provided adjoining to first identical ends of the respective 

magnetoresistive elements in the longitudinal directions 
thereof while common terminals (e, j, l, x) are disposed 

adjoining to second ends of the magnetoresistive elements. 
Either bridge output or common terminals extend round the 

outside of the magnetoresistive elements to positions adja­
cent to the common or bridge output terminals. Thus, the 

total width of the magnetoresistive elements pattern can be 
greatly reduced thereby providing a magnetic detector of 

high performance in which the influence of fluctuations of 
gap or spacing between the magnetic detector and the 

magnetic recording medium used together therewith.
