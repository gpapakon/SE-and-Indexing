<ABSTRACT>
A countershaft type power transmission has a 
plurality of selectively engageable friction clutches 

for establishing a plurality of forward drive ratios 
and a reverse drive ratio between meshing gear members 

on an input shaft (12), a countershaft and an output 
shaft (50). One of the power paths established by the 

meshing gears includes a gear member (48) rotationally 
fast on the output shaft. A parking pawl member (74) 

is selectively engageable with this gear member to 
prevent output shaft rotation when parking is desired. 

The pawl has teeth (80A-D) formed thereon having a 
profile which permit continuous simultaneous 

engagement between two teeth on the pawl and two teeth 
(78) on the gear member regardless of the rotational 

bias imposed on the output shaft during parking.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to parking mechanisms 
for power transmissions. In vehicles equipped with automatic 
transmissions, the park function is typically 
accomplished by locking the drive wheels of the 
vehicle through the transmission to ground. The 
wheels are generally held by engaging a parking pawl 
into a dedicated parking gear that is connected 
continuously with the wheels through the transmission 
output shaft. One such device, in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1, is shown in US-A-3241637. 
US-A-1798808 discloses a similar arrangement. Since the parking pawl prevents the wheels from 
turning by grounding them to the transmission case, the 
strength requirements of the pawl must generally be taken 
by a single tooth design mated to a gear having 
complementary teeth formed thereon. This results in 
designing the gear with a circular tooth thickness large 
enough to withstand the parking forces. The pawl is also 
designed with a pressure angle of approximately 16 
degrees to provide for control of the push out force on 
the pawl during parking. This push out force must be 
maintained with any range, such that excessive pull out 
forces are not required when the transmission is parked 
on a steep grade. There have been some consideration given to 
multi-tooth park mechanisms, however, these mechanisms 
do not generally provide the resistance to sheer loads 
that are desired. A parking mechanism in accordance with the 
present invention is characterised over US-A-3241637 
by the features specified in Claim 1. The present invention provides a parking 
pawl mechanism of reduced mass and cost and, most  
 
importantly, axial space. The parking function is 
accomplished by utilising the reverse driven gear to 
provide the parking gear. The reverse driven gear is 
rotationally fast with the transmission output shaft 
and, therefore, when grounded, will provide the 
parking function desired. The reverse gear does have a large diametral 
pitch, however, it also has a reduced circular tooth 
thickness. To accommodate this reduced circular tooth 
thickness, the present invention provides a parking 
pawl which will have two teeth in contact with the 
reverse gear during engagement and disengagement. As a general rule, the working gears of the 
transmission have a pressure angle of approximately 22 
degrees. The use of this pressure angle on the 
parking pawl teeth would result in excess push out 
forces resulting in the need for a heavier park 
mechanism. The present invention can solve this dilemma

<CLAIMS>
A parking mechanism for a power 
transmission having a working gear (48) continuously 

drive connected with an output shaft (50), the parking 
mechanism comprising a pawl (74) having a plurality of 

park teeth (80A-D) formed thereon defining at least 
two forward parking tooth surfaces and two reverse 

parking gear surfaces; and means (75) for operatively 
selecting the park condition with movement of the pawl 

teeth into engagement with the teeth of the working 
gear; characterised in that the pawl (74) is pivotally 

mounted; and in that each park tooth has a profile 
defining continuous engagement of the two forward 

parking tooth surfaces with respective teeth (78A-E) 
on the working gear when a park cond
ition is selected 
and the working gear has a forward rotation bias and 

continuous engagement of the two reverse parking tooth 
surfaces with respective teeth on the working gear 

when the park condition is selected and the working 
gear has a reverse rotation bias. 
A parking mechanism as claimed in Claim 
1, wherein the teeth (78A-E) on the working gear (48) 

are defined by an outer surface having a constant 
diameter (84); wherein the teeth (80A-D) on the pawl 

(74) are defined by an engaging surface having a 
diametral portion defining a constant diameter 

addendum circle (82) which is disposed in 
concentricity with the constant diameter of the 

working gear when the teeth of the pawl and working 
gear are in radial alignment. 
A parking mechanism as claimed in Claim 
2, wherein the pawl (74) has a minimum of four teeth 

(80A-D) and further wherein two of the teeth are in 
continuous engagement with the working gear (48) 

during parking when a forward rotational bias is 
imposed on the working gear and another two of the  

 
teeth are in continuous engagement with the working 

gear during parking when a reverse rotational bias is 
imposed on the working gear.
