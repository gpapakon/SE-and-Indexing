<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cleaning product for 
cleaning contaminated surfaces comprising a textile 

structure of fibres, wherein fibres are provided with an 
agent with biocide action, wherein for instance a part of 

the fibres is provided with the biocidal agent, the 
biocidal agent is incorporated in the fibres or the 

surface of the fibres is coated with the biocidal agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning product 
such as a cleaning cloth, for instance a floor cleaner 
and a cleaning glove, based on a textile structure and 
more particularly to a cleaning product with a textile 
structure in which substantially no cleaning products 
such as soaps, emulsifiers, solvents (anti-)foaming 
agents and the like are included in order to provide or 
enhance the product cleaning properties. The textile 
structure provides the product with its cleaning properties. The textile structure, such as a knitted material, 
woven material, non-woven or brush, comprises fibres 
which are cut on at least one side of the structure, 
whereby microfibres are formed protruding from this side 
which provide the textile structure with the cleaning 
properties. Such cleaning products can be used in the household, 
in the sauna, the office and the workplace to clean skin, 
objects, tools and floors. Depending on the intensity of 
use the cleaning product retains its cleaning action for 
a long period and can be washed regularly, for example 
five to ten times. It has nevertheless been established 
that the appreciation of the cleaning product and its 
cleaning action decrease due to colour change, odour 
formation and accumulation of alien material. The present invention has for its object to change 
the cleaning product such that the appreciation increases 
and the above described undesired effects are avoided as 
far as possible, while there is substantially no adverse 
effect on the cleaning properties, let alone that it is 
required that additional means must be added to the 
finished cleaning product by the user. It has been found that the above described phenomena 
can be traced back to an undesired bacteria/mould growth 
in the textile structure, wherein the present invention  
 
is based on steps which prevent or avoid such a bacteria/mould 
growth. This is achieved according to the invention with a 
cleaning product according to the invention for cleaning 
contaminated surfaces comprising a textile structure of 
fibres, wherein fibres are provided with an agent with 
biocidal action. Providing the fibres with the biocidal 
agent achieves that bacteria/mould accumulating in the 
vicinity of the fibres are inhibited in their growth and 
possibly even killed. Understood by a biocidal agent is an agent which 
inhibits the growth of and/or kills bacteria/mould. Not 
every biocidal agent can be used since according to the 
invention it is required that the biocidal agent is 
incorporated
