<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning blade (16) is made of a polyurethane 
elastomer characterized by having the following 

properties: 

(1) a trimethylolpropane concentration of at 
least 0.10 mM/g; 
(2) an urethane group concentration of at least 
2.20 mM/g; and 
(3) a temperature giving a maximum of a tanδ, of 
at most 12 °C. 
The polyurethane elastomer may preferably be 
obtained by reacting a polyester-based prepolymer 

(e.g., obtained by reacting a polyester diol, obtained 
from adipic acid, ethylene glycol and/or butylene 

glycol, with 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate) with a 
hardener composition comprising 1,4-butanediol and 

trimethylolpropane. The cleaning blade (16) is excellent 
in creep characteristics, a durability and a low-temperature 

cleaning function and thus is suitable for 
constituting a practical electrophotographic apparatus 

and a process cartridge for an image-forming 
apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning blade, particularly a cleaning blade for electrophotography, and also relates to a process cartridge containing the cleaning blade and an electrophotographic apparatus using the cleaning blade.Electrophotographic copying machines and laser beam printers provide an image by utilizing electrophotography wherein an electrostatic latent image formed on a photosensitive drum is developed with a toner to form a toner image and then the toner image is transferred to a transfer material (e.g. paper) to fix the toner image thereon.After copying process, residual toner particles on the surface of the photosensitive drum are generally removed by means of a cleaner such as a cleaning blade.In order to remove the residual toner particles, a cleaning blade has been used such a state that the cleaning blade is kept in contact with the photosensitive drum under a prescribed pressure, thus leading to an occurrence of a creep phenomenon (i.e., deformation with time). As a result, the prescribed pressure has been gradually decreased to lower a toner-removing ability of the cleaning blade, thus adversely affecting a resultant toner image (e.g., image staining or image contamination).The cleaning blade is generally abraded or broken at an end portion thereof by an abrasion or wearing between the cleaning blade and the photosensitive drum during a normal copying process and is decreased in an ability of removing residual toner particles on the surface of the photosensitive drum. As a result, an outputted image is stained with the residual toner particles. Accordingly, when the cleaning blade is used, the number of copying sheets is restricted due to the above-mentioned creep phenomenon. In addition, such a creep phenomenon is generated at the time of a pause in a copying process, so that the number of acceptable copying sheets after a long pause period of time is considerably decreased.Heretofore, a cleaning blade has generally been composed of a polyurethane elastomer in view of its good abrasion resistance etc. However, such a cleaning blade has failed to satisfactorily suppress the creep phenomenon. There have been known cleaning blades comprising a polyurethane elastomer using a trifunctional alcohol such as trimethylolpropane (TMP) as a hardener (or curing agent) as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) No. 62-11719. Such cleaning blades have slightly improved in creep characteristics such as permanent deformation. However, there have been room for further
