<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyurethaneurea 
solution that is protected against changes in viscosity 
and to spandex dry spun therefrom. More particularly, 
the invention concerns such a solution containing a small 
amount of a specific 4,4'-biphenylene diphosphonite. Polyurethaneureas are prepared by reacting a 
hydroxyl-terminated linear polymer, such as a polyether 
glycol or a polyester glycol, with an organic 
diisocyanate to form a prepolymer, which is then 
chain-extended with a diamine. Usually, the reactions 
are conducted in an inert organic solvent. The solutions 
are suited for dry spinning into spandex. However, to 
produce spandex with consistent properties, the solutions 
should be of constant viscosity. Fluctuations or changes 
in solution viscosity during storage, processing or dry 
spinning can result in variations in threadline tension, 
difficulties in winding and unwinding, and various 
non-uniformities in elastic properties of the spandex. Several methods have been suggested to control 
polyurethaneurea solution viscosity. However, each has 
shortcomings. For example, Nakahara et al, U. S. Patent 
3,726,836 discloses use of an N,N-dialkylhydrazine as a 
polymer chain terminator and subsequent heat-aging to 
stabilize polyurethane solutions against gelation. 
However, such chain terminators are potentially 
carcinogenic and the process is time-consuming. Also, 
Schollenberger et al, U. S. Patent 3,939,111 discloses  
 
use of ammonium salts of strong acids to stabilize 
polyurethane solution viscosity, but such salts are 
hygroscopic and the presence of water in the polymer 
solution can render the solution unsatisfactory for 
dry-spinning. Accordingly, a purpose of this invention 
is to provide polyurethaneurea solutions of constant 
viscosity, so that the solutions can be dry spun into 
spandex, without suffering the aforementioned 
shortcomings. Lewis, U. S. Patent 4,548,975 in Example 3, 
Comparison 9, and Kausch et al, U. S. Patent 4,877,825, 
Comparison Example 13, each disclose a polyurethaneurea 
solution containing tetrakis-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)-4,4'-biphenylene 
diphosphonite in an amount that results in a 
2% concentration of the phosphonite in dry-spun spandex. 
The disclosures concern protection of spandex against 
discoloration due to heat, combustion gases and light. 
However, in both references the phosphonite is employed 
in comparison samples that are shown to be inferior to 
the claimed stabilizers of the references. Furthermore, 
both references are silent on
