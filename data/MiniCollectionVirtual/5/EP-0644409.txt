<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for sensing data such as temperature with 
respect to objects such as silicon wafers undergoing 

fabrication or other processes involve the use of a monitor 
element of material and configuration similar to that of the 

objects being processed. A structure such as a closed loop 
or segment of a spiral may be formed on the surface of the 

monitor element, and acts as a secondary coil when brought 
into operative relation with a transformer structure which 

includes a primary coil, a current source and a sensing 
device. The sensing device senses variations in the 

electrical characteristics in the primary coil, caused by 
the presence of the monitor element, and can thereby 

determine the temperature or other desired data relating to 
the monitor element, which is substantially the same as 

comparable data for the objects being processed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of remotely sensing temperature conditions
at the location of silicon wafers undergoing a process.One measurement method in current use involves an optical measurement which
measures the black body radiation spectrum or a portion of it which is a function of
temperature. This measurement is highly dependent upon the surface conditions of the
substrate being measured and is therefore difficult to make.Another measurement method involves the use of a thermocouple. This method
is also difficult to carry out because it requires good contact with the wafer for fast and
accurate measurements.EP-A-0406751 discloses an apparatus for sensing process conditions during a
process in which a plurality of elements are fabricated and employing a monitor element
for assisting in sensing the process conditions and WO-A-8601595 discloses a
thermometer arrangement including an inductor structure serving to provide for a contactless
temperature measuring arrangement.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of measuring temperature conditions
of silicon wafers being processed, which overcomes the aforementioned
difficulties.According to the present invention there is provided a method of monitoring
temperature conditions of a plurality of silicon wafers during a silicon wafer fabrication
process, characterized by the steps of introducing a silicon-wafer-monitor element similar
in material and shape to the said silicon wafers into the process in addition to the said
silicon wafers and having electrical characteristics determined by its temperature, 
inductively coupling the said silicon-wafer-monitor element to a primary coil forming part
of a primary inductor structure while the said silicon wafers and the said silicon-wafer-monitor
element are exposed to the said processing conditions, the primary inductor
structure further comprising a current source and a sensor connected to the said primary coil so
as to inductively couple eddy currents in the silicon-wafer-monitor element, sensing
changes in an electrical signal in the primary coil with the sensor, the changes in the signal
being induced by variations of the eddy currents in the silicon-wafer-monitor element, and
converting the sensed changes to a temperature value.It will be appreciated that the impedance of the silicon wafer monitor element can be determined by
changes in current amplitude and phase within the primary coil.The examples shown in Fig. 1-4 are not covered by the claims but provide
examples
