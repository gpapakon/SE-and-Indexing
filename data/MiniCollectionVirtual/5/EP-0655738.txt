<ABSTRACT>
In an error correction circuit, when a data loss is 
detected, substitute data comprising all bits of "1" or "0" are 

generated during a data loss period and substituted for the 
lost data for the data loss period. Thereafter, the whole data 

containing the substitute data are decoded in a predetermined 
error correction system to generate corrected data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an error correction circuit for
correcting errors of data recorded on an information recording
medium, and particularly to an error correction circuit for
correcting errors of data recorded on an information-writable
recording medium using a predetermined encode system (for example, an
optical card or the like).Various kinds of encode systems such as an NRZ (non-return-to-zero)
encode system, an MFM (modified frequency
modulation) encode system, an MFM-RZ (modified frequency
modulation-return-to-zero) encode system have been known as an
encode system for data recording and reproducing operations on
and from an information-writable recording medium such as an
optical card or the like.In order to read out data which are recorded on an
information recording medium in one of the NRZ encode system,
the MFM encode system, the MFM-RZ encode system, etc., the data
are input to an error correction circuit to correct errors of
the data. If a syndrome represents "0", the error correction
would succeed, and thus accurate data could be obtained. On the
other hand, if the syndrome represents "1", the error
correction would fail.Fig. 4 is a timing chart showing the encoding of the NRZ
encode system, the MFM encode system and the MFM-RZ encode
system.A first (uppermost) stage (a) of Fig. 4 represents a bit
sequence of data to be recorded, a second stage (b) of Fig. 4
represents a recording operation of the NRZ encode system for
the data, a third stage (c) of Fig. 4 represents a recording
operation of the MFM encode system for the data and a fourth
(lowermost) stage (d) of Fig. 4 represents a recording 
operation of the MFM-RZ encode system for the data.In the NRZ encode system, the polarity of current to be
supplied for recording is varied in accordance with the data
bit sequence. For example, as shown at the stages (a) and (b) of
Fig. 4, the recording current flows forwardly (positively) when
a bit to be recorded (hereinafter referred to as "record-target
bit") is "1", and on the other hand it flows backwardly
(negatively) when the record-target bit is "0". Accordingly,
this encode system performs a data recording operation with no
period for which the current is equal to zero, thereby
improving the recording density.In the MFM encode system, inversion of magnetization for
recording is controlled in accordance with the data bit
sequence. For example, as shown at the stages (a) and (c) of
Fig. 4, the inversion of magnetization is made when the record-target
bit is "1", no inversion of
