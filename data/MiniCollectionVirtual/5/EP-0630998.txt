<ABSTRACT>
A conveying mechanism (11) conveys a mater material (M) 
along a first conveying path (11A) and then downwardly along 

a second conveying path (11B) while holding the material (M) 
between first and second conveyor belts (20, 30). The second 

conveying path (11B) oscillates about a fulcrum defined by a 
downstream point (23A) on the first conveying path (11A). A 

reciprocating mechanism (70) causes a substantially horizontal 
reciprocating motion of the discharge end of the mat material 

(M) from the second conveying path (11B), and also imparts a 
force which urges the discharge end in the reverse direction 

to accelerate said discharge end on reversal. In this manner, 
the collection of cotton takes place evenly across the folded 

area of the piled-up material, to provide an even surface 
density over the entire piled-up material (M), thereby 

increasing the effective width and reducing the amount of edge 
trimming from the folded areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for
manufacturing piled-up cotton mat in which the collection or
forming of cotton takes place by oscillating the downstream
discharge end of an inorganic fiber mat which is continuously
conveyed from an upstream point.In the manufacture of a piled-up cotton mat comprising
inorganic fibers such as rock wool or glass wool, a
techinique, commonly referred to as a pendulum system as
illustrated in Figs. 18 and 19, has been employed (see OS-DE
41 27 172 A1). As illustrated in Fig. 18, a pendulum system
comprises a conveyor 2 which continuously conveys a mat
material M1, commonly referred to as a primary web or
collected primary fleece, which is then held between a pair
of oscillating conveyors 3, 4 to be carried downward while
the conveyors 3, 4 are subjected to an oscillating motion
about the axis of a fulcrum roller 2A, defined by one of the
roolers of the conveyor 2, under the control of an
oscillating mechanism 5. As shown in Fig. 19, the mat
material M1 which is discharged at a given rate from the
oscillating ends 8 of the oscillating conveyors 3, 4 is
dropped in a shaken manner onto a forming conveyor 6 located 
below it for accumulation thereon to manufacture a piled-up
cotton mat 7 while the conveyors 3, 4 experience a traverse
motion. Upon a change in the direction D1 of traverse
motion or when the mat material M1 is being folded upon
itself, there occurs a glut of the mat 7 in folded areas 7A,
7B since during a time interval t10 which is required for the
oscillating end 8 to reach a given speed of oscillating
motion after it has passed through either dead point P10 or
P20, the speed as projected onto a horizontal plane
diminishes. Accordingly, an effective width Wef1 of the
piled-up mat measured across the folded areas 7A, 7B must be
determined in consideration of such glut of the mat 7 in the
folded areas 7A, 7B, which must be edge trimmed to produce a
final product.In conventional mats, the magnitude of the glut
occurring in the folded areas 7A, 7B depends on the material
and the thickness of the mat material, whereby the surface
density of the entire mat 7 as viewed in the direction of
traverse motion tends to be uneven. This necessitated that a
stroke of the oscillation motion be chosen to be
predeterminately greater in consideration of variations in the
folded areas in order to secure a desired effective width.
This resulted in an increase in the amount of edge trim of the
folded areas 7A, 7B to cause a cost increase upon finishing
into a

at a given rate while holding it sandwiched within the second
conveying means (30), oscillating the second conveying means

(30) at a given oscillating rate about a fulcrum (23A) defined
on a downstream point on the first conveying means (20) to

discharge the mat material (M) from the oscillating end of the

second conveying means (30) in a traverse motion for
accumulating it on a running forming conveyor (6) while

folding it upon itself, accelerating the oscillating end of
the second conveying means (30) during reversal in the

reciprocating motion of the oscillating end of the second
conveying means (30) and also imparts a force which urges the

oscillating end in the reverse direction to accelerate the
oscillating end on reversal for a time interval from the limit

of outward movement of the oscillating motion until the
oscillating rate is restored, thereby to increase the rising 

speed of said oscillating end.
