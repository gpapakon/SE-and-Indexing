<ABSTRACT>
The invention demonstrates an apparatus for mixing multicomponent cement (3), such as bone cement with at least one liquid component (3a), the components (3a, 3b) being introduced into an otherwise empty, slender mixing vessel (11). This mixing vessel is attached on its lower side to a positive and/or frictional coupling (4), which itself is connected to a vibrating drive (7), in order to transmit a vibrating motion to the mixing vessel in a vibration plane (5) transversely to the longitudinal axis (6) of the mixing vessel (11). In order to achieve good flow for mixing the components, a volume of gas or air is left in the mixing vessel (11), which permits a displacement of the liquid component against gravity in the case of accelerations transversely to gravity. A circular vibrating motion is particularly advantageous, because this generates constant acceleration and flow for mixing components (3a, 3b). Since the mixing vessel (11) is free of any additional internals, vessels can be used which are directly suitable for spraying out ready mixed cement.
