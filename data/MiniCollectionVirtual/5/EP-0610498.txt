<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a honing tool for applying honing finishing to works with high 
precision and a method of super-high-precision finishing using said honing tool, the honing 

tool being composed of mainly a pilot part (5), rough grinder part (7), finishing grinder part 
(10), and correction part (13). The honing tool is fed at high speed while being reciprocated a 

short distance at a time to apply grind finishing and straightness correction finishing for complete 
honing. This invention enables increase in grinding work efficiceny, improvement in precision 

in finishing and honing finishing providing a high degree of straightness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a honing tool for carrying
out honing working of a work with high precision and super
precision finishing method using the same.In the prior art, when honing working is to be carried out,
a tool with several grindstones attached on its periphery is
used, and while the tool is supplied with rotational motion, it
is moved in reciprocating motion by a distance corresponding to
working area of the work thereby the grinding working is carried
out.One example of such a honing tool is shown in Fig. 1.The honing tool 61 comprises a hollow mandrel 62, and a
plurality of grindstones 66 being provided on the outer
circumference of the top end portion 63 of the mandrel 62 and
movable in the radial direction. The grindstones 66 are rotated
while being pushed to the outside through a bed plate 67 by
moving a taper part 65 of a mandrel shaft 64 up and down, and are
reciprocated up and down repeatedly by the distance corresponding 
to the working area thereby the grinding working of a prescribed
diameter is carried out.In the honing working by such a honing tool 61, however,
when it is reciprocated up and down repeatedly along a
circumferential surface of a hole 81 of a work 80 as shown in
Fig. 2, edge of lands 81a is liable to be unsharpened. Moreover,
when the lands 81a are different in length, there is a problem
that the shorter land 81a is machined more and the finished
diameter becomes larger.If the reciprocating speed is made larger in order to raise
the working efficiency, loading or crushing of the grindstone 66
occurs and the efficiency is rather decreased.Therefore some honing tool is provided with two sets of
grinding sections in order to raise the working efficiency, and
can perform rough machining and finish machining continuously.Fig. 3 shows a honing tool 71 in such constitution. The
honing tool 71 is constituted by a cylindrical body 72, a main
machining grinding section 73 being installed at the top end
portion of the body 72 and comprising a rough grindstone, and a
finish grinding section 74 being installed at the center portion
and comprising a finish grindstone. A tapered adjusting rod 75
is fitted to the inside of the main machining grinding section 73
so that the main machining diameter can be adjusted, and a
tapered adjusting rod 77 is fitted to the inside of the finish
grinding section 74 so that the finish grinding diameter can be 
adjusted.The honing tool 71 with the main machining diameter and the finish machining
diameter being adjusted is rotated and moved

<CLAIMS>
A honing tool (1) for honing a working surface of a finite length of a work (W)
having a plurality of grinding sections in the axial direction of a body (2) having a free

end portion in use and an attachable end portion for connecting the tool to a machine,
the tool comprising:


a pilot section (5) being installed at the free end portion of the body (2) and
capable of being fitted to the work (W);
a rough grinding section (7) being installed adjacent to the portion of said pilot
section (5) remote from the free end portion of the body and capable of being

elastically deformed in the radial direction;
a finish grinding section (10) being installed adjacent to the portion of said
rough grinding section (7) remote from the free end portion of the body and

capable of being elastically deformed in the radial direction;
a correction section (13) which section operably corrects for curvature of the
working surface in the axial direction of the body (2) being installed adjacent

to the portion of said finish grinding section (10) remote from the free end 
portion of the body and formed with a diameter slightly less than the machining

diameter of said finish grinding section and formed longer than the overall
length of the working surface to be honed of said work in the working axis

direction;
a taper hole (17) being bored at least on the inside of said grinding section and
said finish grinding section and is opened widening continuously towards the

free end of said body (2);
an adjusting section (20) being formed so as to be fitted to said taper hole (17)
and having at least two taper parts (21,22) and capable of adjusting

simultaneously the machining diameter of said rough grinding section and said
finish grinding section; and
a universal joint (3) being installed at the attachable end portion side of said
body (2).
A honing tool as set forth in claim 1, wherein a plurality of oil grooves (15)
extend from the free end portion of said body to the attachable end portion thereof. 
A honing tool as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein said rough grinding section
(7) and said finish grinding section (10) are provided with slits (8, 11) to premote

elastic deformation in each radial direction.
A honing tool as set forth in claim 3, wherein slits (8) of said rough grinding
section (7) and slits (11) of said finish grinding sections (10) are installed alternately

with each other in the circumferential direction of said body (2).

claims 1 to 4 for carrying out honing on a working surface of cylindrical bores to be

precision finished in sequence from the free end portion of the honing tool body to the
attachable end portion of said tool body, said method comprising the steps of:


advancing said honing tool toward an area on said working surface to be
precision finished, while rotating and reciprocating said honing tool relative to

said working surface;
while so advancing said honing tool, fitting said pilot section to said area to be
honed and supporting said attachable end portion of said honing tool for

rotating said tool; 
with said pilot section so fitted and while continuing advancing of said honing
