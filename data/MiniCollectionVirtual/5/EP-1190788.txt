<ABSTRACT>
At first, an open end of an original metal pipe

deformed to such the coaxially expanded state 
M

 that axial wall length 
L

 at
a side to be eccentrically expanded is longer than axial wall length 
L

 at the
opposite side to be expanded without eccentricity. The coaxially expanded

open end 
M

 is then plastically deformed to an eccentrically expanded state

M

 by forcibly inserting an eccentrically expanding punch

 into the
coaxially expanded open end

boundary

a predetermined angle Óúç so as to bring the cylindrical body

 into contact
with an inner wall of the coaxially expanded open end

 at a side to be

eccentricity. When the coaxially expanded open end 
M

 is plastically

, metal flow is suppressed at a
side to be eccentrically expanded, but metal flow from the opposite side to be

expanded without eccentricity to the former side is promoted. Consequently,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a metal
pipe having an open end expanded eccentrically with respect to its axis.A metal pipe with an eccentrically expanded open end has been used
as an oil supply pipe for a vehicle fuel or the like. Such the metal pipe has
been manufactured so far by bulging an open end of an original metal pipe or
by connecting a metal pipe with a squeezed open end to another metal pipe
with an expanded open end. However, any process is too complicated,
resulting in rising of a manufacturing cost. In this regard, a different method
has been examined, whereby an original metal pipe is radially expanded at
its open end by forcibly inserting a tapered expanding punch.In a conventional expanding method, an expanding punch is forcibly
inserted into an original metal pipe 1 with an open end vertical to its axis, as
shown in Fig. 1. The open end is plastically deformed to a coaxially expanded
state 2 by insertion of the expanding punch. When an expanding punch
tapered at its tip is used, a tapered part 4 is formed between a straight part 3
and the expanded open end 2. Thereafter, another punch, which is held at a
position shifted from an axis of the straight part 3, is inserted into the
expanded open end 2 so as to form an eccentrically expanded open end 5
decentered from the axis of the straight part 3.Although the eccentrically expanded part 5 is formed by inserting the
punch whose center axis is decentered in a certain distance from the axis of
the straight part 3 toward a direction D, a deformation ratio of the original
metal pipe 1 is varied along a circumferential direction in response to
eccentricity. In short, wall thickness of the original metal pipe 1 is not 
reduced so much at a side 7 to be expanded without eccentricity, but the
original metal pipe 1 is preferentially stretched at a side 6 to be eccentrically
expanded along its circumferential direction with less metal flow from the
side 7 to the side 6. Consequently, the eccentrically expanded side 6 is
thinned along the circumferential direction. The thin wall causes occurrence
of troubles such as cracking or necking. Occurrence of troubles is likely
intensified as increase of an expanding ratio. The partially thinned wall also
degrades mechanical strength of a product.The present invention aims at provision of a metal pipe with an
eccentrically expanded open end free from cracks and necking, by formation
of a coaxially expanded open end, which is elongated along an axial direction
of the metal pipe at

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a metal pipe with an eccentrically
expanded open end, which comprises the steps of:


forcibly inserting a coaxially expanding punch into an open end of an
original metal pipe, so as to plastically deform said open end to such the

coaxially expanded state that the side of the deformed open end to be eccentrically expanded is
longer than the opposite side to be expanded without eccentricity along

an axial direction of said original metal pipe:

withdrawing said coaxially expanding punch from said original metal
pipe; and then
forcibly inserting an eccentrically expanding punch, which has a
boundary between a conical tip and a cylindrical body inclined with a

predetermined angle with respect to a radial direction of said original
metal pipe so that said cylindrical body comes in contact with an inner

wall of the coaxially expanded open end at the side to be eccentrically
expanded earlier than the opposite side to be expanded without

eccentricity, into the coaxially expanded open end of said original metal
pipe so as to plastically deform said open end to an eccentrically

expanded state.
The method of manufacturing a metal pipe with an eccentrically
expanded open end defined in Claim 1, wherein the coaxially expanding

punch has a boundary between a conical tip and a cylindrical body
inclined with such an angle that a length of said cylindrical body along an

axial direction of the original metal pipe is shorter at the side to be
eccentrically expanded than the opposite side to be expanded without

eccentricity, and the inclination of said boundary is opposite to the
inclination of the boundary between the conical tip and the cylindrical

body of the eccentrically expanding punch.
