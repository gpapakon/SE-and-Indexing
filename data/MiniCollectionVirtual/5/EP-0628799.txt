Method for detecting and evaluating the exhaust 
gases from vehicles, the exhaust gas composition being 

analysed and the absolute quantities of individual 
pollutants being determined, and the pollutant values 

detected being compared with preset limit values, characterized 
in that limiting averages (
M
max
(i)) per preset 
distance (S) travelled are preset for the individual 

pollutants (i), that the detected pollutant quantities 
(M
act
(i)) are summated over the preset distance (S) 
travelled and averages (
M
act
(i)) are formed, and that the 
running speed (V) is restricted to a preset maximum value 

(V
max
) when at least one of the pollutant averages (
M
act
(i)) 
exceeds the corresponding limiting average (
M
max
(i)). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it is determined by reference to the operating 

parameters of the vehicle whether the limiting average 
(
M
max
(i)) is exceeded owing to a functional fault. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that, if a functional fault is present, the restriction 

of the running speed (V) can be lifted only after the 
functional fault has been eliminated by a workshop. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that, if a functional fault is present, the maximum value 

(V
2
) for the running speed (V) is selected such that only 
emergency running is still possible. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that, when a limiting average (
M
max
(i)) is exceeded without 
the presence of a functional fault, the running speed (V) 

of the vehicle is restricted to a value (V
1
) until the  
 

pollutant average (
M
act
(i)) determined falls again below 
the limiting average (
M
max
(i)). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pollutant averages (
M
act
(i)) and the limiting 
averages (
M
max
(i)) are indicated. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pollutant averages (
M
act
(i)) are compared with 
corresponding threshold values (
M
thr
(i)), the threshold 
values (
M
thr
(i)) being smaller than the limiting averages 
(
M
max
(i)), and that a warning signal is issued when a 
threshold value (
M
thr
(i)) is exceeded. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pollutant quantities (M
act
(i)) determined are 
stored and can be read out for levying the tax. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the method can be interrupted and that the pollutant 

quantities (M
int
(i)) arising during the interruption of 
the method are detected and evaluated separately. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the quality of the surrounding air is analysed at 

preset times and the limiting averages (
M
max
(i)) are preset 
as a function of the quality of the surrounding air. 
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the measurement interval (S) is preset as a function 

of the quality of the surrounding air.
