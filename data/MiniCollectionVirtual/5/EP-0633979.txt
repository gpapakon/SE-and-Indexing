<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a scroll-type expander-compressor drive
system having a scroll-type expander which is used to drive a scroll-type
compressor or pump. The scroll-type expander driven compressor system is
particularly adaptable for use in combination with a combustor, such as an internal
combustion engine, which produces exhaust gases for driving the scroll-type
expander. The scroll-type expander may then drive the scroll-type compressor
which can be used to supply pressurized air to the combustor or to drive other
systems.The use of a scroll-type expander driven compressor assembly in
combination with a combustor is known in the art as exemplified by the teachings 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,192, 152. In such known arrangements, the exhaust gas
from a combustor is used to drive an expander which is mounted upon a
common shaft with a compressor. By this arrangement, the exhaust gas from
the combustor drives the expander which, in turn, drives the compressor in
order to provide pressurized air for the combustion process.Such known expander-compressor drive systems have been found to be
extremely efficient due to the inherent operating nature of scroll fluid devices.
Unfortunately, the advantages of such drive arrangements have not hereto
before been fully realized due to various deficiencies associated with the prior
art systems. For instance, such prior art systems have been rather bulky due
to the manner in which the expander drives the compressor, the use of
individual counterweights for the scrolls and the inclusion of separate
synchronizers between the drive and driven scroll elements. In addition, when
used in combination with a combustor, the scroll fluid devices are subject to
a wide range of temperatures which tend to expand or contract the relatively
rotating scroll elements which result in system vibrations, noise and efficiency
losses.The use of individual counterweights and separate synchronizers
between the drive and driven scroll elements may be avoided by forming the
expander and compressor integrally with each other on opposite sides of a
common orbital member carrying the orbital scroll elements of the expander and
compressor, for example as disclosed in US-A-5,094,205 and 4,677,949 and
DE-A-3,826,640. However, this configuration tends to accentuate the
aforesaid temperature-related problems because of heat transfer from the
expander to the compressor.Therefore, there exists a need in the art for a scroll-type expander driven
compressor assembly which is compact, compensates
