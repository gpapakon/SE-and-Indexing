<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides the substantially pure 
(R) enantiomer of a compound of the Formula II: 


The compounds of Formula II are useful in the preparation 
of the substantially pure (R) enantiomer of angiotensin II 

antagonists of Formula III: 

wherein R₁, Ar, R₂ and X are variables.

<DESCRIPTION>
The hormone angiotensin II is recognized as one 
of the most potent vasopressor agents that produces 
hypertension in mammals. The action of the enzyme renin on 
the plasma protein substrate angiotensinogen results in 
production of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I, which 
upon conversion by the nonselective angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) provides angiotensin II, the active hormone. 
See e.g. Regoli et al., Pharm. Rev.26: 69 (1974). U.S. Patent No. 5,073,566 and EP-A-573271 disclose 
potent and effective 1,3-imidazoles, as angiotensin II 
antagonists of the Formula I: 
These compounds may exist in various 
stereoisomeric forms. In particular, the compounds exist 
as enantiomers due to the chiral carbon atom to which the 
imidazole, R₁, and R₂ are attached. U.S. Patent No.5,073,566 
and EP-A-573271 disclose the separation of the enantiomers by 
chromatographic separation of an intermediate or the final 
product. The obvious shortcomings of chromatographic 
separation are inefficiency and expense. The separation is 
particularly inefficient if the separation is performed as 
the final step where one-half of the final product may be 
discarded as the undesired enantiomer.  The present invention provides compounds that 
are useful as intermediates in the preparation of the 
substantially pure (R) enantiomer of angiotensin II 
antagonists of Formula I. The compounds of the present invention are 
prepared by a process generally characterized as an optical 
resolution. See Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates 
and Resolutions (John Wiley and Sons 1981). Unfortunately, 
when attempting to apply these general teachings to 
efficiently separate enantiomers, it is impossible to 
determine what conditions or resolving agents will be 
successful. In the present invention, resolving agents 
such as brucine, ephedrine, quinidine, cinchonine, and 
quinine produced unacceptable mixtures of diastereoisomeric 
salts. Thus, the present invention further provides a 
process of preparing the compounds of the present invention 
by disclosing a remarkably effective resolving agent that 
selectively crystallizes the substantially pure enantiomer. This invention provides the substantially pure 
(R) enantiomer of a compound of the Formula II: 
wherein R₁ is C₄-C₉ straight chain alkyl, C₄-C₉ straight 
chain trifluoroalkyl, C₄-C₉ straight chain alkenyl, or C₄-C₉ 
straight chain trifluoroalkenyl. In addition, this invention provides the (-)-cinchonidine 
salt of compounds of the Formula II.  The invention further
