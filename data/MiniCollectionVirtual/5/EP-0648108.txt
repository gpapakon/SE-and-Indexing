Preparation for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of caries, in 
the form of a chewable mass, chewable sweets, sucking sweets, 

toothpaste, mouth wash, mouth spray or other oral hygiene means, 
having calcium and phosphate, which are present in a dissolved or freely 

soluble form, as well as a proton donor 
wherein
 that 

upon application in the oral cavity at the latest calcium and phosphate 
change into a saturated solution 
and the acidic proportion is selected in such a way that the pH value 
obtains a valve between 4 and 4.5. 
Preparation according to claim 1, 
wherein
 as a base mass sugar or 
sugar substitute and/or gelatine and/or gum arabic and/or chewing mass 

is contained. 
Preparation according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 said proton donor is an 
organic acid, especially an acid used to aromatise confectionery, such as 

citric acid, lactic acid, fruit acid, tartaric acid or their mixtures. 
Preparation according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 the calcium 
compound is a calcium fruit acid salt.  

 
Preparation according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 in a solid state 
the proportion of calcium is 0.9 to 3.6 weight per cent, preferably 1.35 to 

2.7 weight per cent, especially 1.8 to 2.25 weight per cent and that of the 
phosphate is 0.47 to 3.73, especially 0.94 to 2.82 and a quantity of 400 to 

1500 millival of fruit acid per kilogram of solid mass. 
Preparation according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein
 in the case of a 
toothpaste there is a proportion of 160 to 660 mM of calcium compounds 

per kilogram preferably 240 to 500, especially 320 to 400 mM/kg and in 
the case of phosphate a proportion of 40 to 330 mM/kg preferably 80 to 

250 mM/kg and the acid proportion is 300 to 1200 millival/kg of 
toothpaste. 
Preparation according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 in the case of 
mouth wash the proportion of calcium is 5 to 22 mM, especially 10 to 15 

mM and the proportion of the phosphate is 1 to 10, preferably 3 to 8 mM 
and the proportion of the acid is 10 to 40 millival/kg. 
Preparation according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 the content of a 
substance that inhibits fractional precipitation, especially fluoride is in a 

concentration of 0.7 to 2.4 mM/kg.  
 
Preparation according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 a calcium 
and/or phosphate adsorbing substrate is added. 
Preparation according to claim 9, 
wherein
 the adsorbing substance is 
a polyglucan. 
Preparation according to claim 9, 
wherein
 the adsorbing substance is 
a mucin. 
Preparation according to claim 9, 
wherein
 the adsorbing substance is 
bipolar.
