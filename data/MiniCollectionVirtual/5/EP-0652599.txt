<ABSTRACT>
A lateral Semiconductor-On-Insulator (SOI) device includes a substrate, a 
buried insulating layer on the substrate, and a lateral semiconductor device such as an 

LDMOS transistor on the insulating layer. The semiconductor device includes a source 
region, a channel region, an insulated gate electrode over the channel region, a lateral 

drift region on the buried insulating layer, and a drain region which is laterally spaced 
apart from the channel region and connected to the channel region by the drift region. 
According to the invention a portion of the semiconductor device is made 
in a first semiconductor material and the lateral drift region comprises a wide bandgap 

second semiconductor material. 
The first semiconductor material, such as silicon or germanium or a 
combination of both, is easy to process, whereas the wide bandgap second material 

gives high breakdown voltage and good operational characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a lateral Semiconductor-on-Insulator (SOI) device 
comprising a substrate, a buried insulating layer on said substrate, and a lateral 
semiconductor device on said insulating layer, said semiconductor device comprising a 
source region of a first conductivity type, a channel region of a second conductivity 
type opposite to that of the first, an insulated gate electrode over said channel region, a 
lateral drift region of said first conductivity type on said buried insulating layer, and a 
drain region of said first conductivity type, laterally spaced apart from said channel 
region and connected thereto by said drift region. Such an SOI devices is useful for 
high-voltage and power applications. In fabricating high-voltage power devices, tradeoffs and compromises 
must typically be made in areas such as breakdown voltage, size, "on" resistance and 
manufacturing simplicity and reliability. Frequently, improving one parameter, such as 
a breakdown voltage, will result in the degradation of another parameter, such as "on" 
resistance. Ideally, such devices would feature superior characteristics in all areas, with 
a minimum of operational and fabrication drawbacks. One category of power devices that has shown considerable promise uses 
a semiconductor layer provided on an insulating layer in a lateral configuration. A 
typical lateral double-diffused MOS (LDMOS) transistor in an SOI configuration (corresponding to the preamble of claim 1) is 
shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,059,547. Such a device, although an improvement over 
earlier devices, is still a compromise in terms of the tradeoff between breakdown 
voltage and "on" resistance. A further improvement in the operating characteristics of SOI devices has 
been attempted by fabricating devices completely in wide bandgap materials such as 
silicon carbide (SiC). In U.S. Patent No. 4,983,538, for example, a conventional 
MOSFET is shown in a silicon carbide layer on an insulator. However, as noted in that 
Patent, the use of SiC entails various manufacturing problems and complexities, and 
such materials are still not commercially feasible for fabricating lateral SOI power 
devices.  
 Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a lateral SOI device with 
superior operational characteristics, in a device configuration which is commercially 
feasible for manufacture using known processing technology. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a lateral SOI device 
having a high breakdown voltage, low "on" resistance and
