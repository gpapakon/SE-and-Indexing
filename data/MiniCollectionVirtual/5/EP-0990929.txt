<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for stripping an outer jacket from a fiber optic cable is
disclosed. The end of a fiber optic cable (390) is inserted between an upper cutting surface (310)

and a lower cutting surface (320) in the fiber optic stripping tool. The fiber optic cable is
engaged by the upper cutting surface substantially along a first half of the

circumference of the outer jacket and the lower cutting surface substantially along the
second half of the circumference of the outer jacket. The cutting surfaces cut through

the circumference of the outer jacket. The cutting surfaces are disengaged from the
jacket and the cut portion of the jacket is removed from the fiber optic cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for stripping an outer
jacket from a fiber optic cable. More specifically, the present invention provides for
engaging the outer jacket of the cable with a first cutting surface around half of the
circumference of the jacket and engaging the other half of the circumference of the
jacket with a second cutting surface in order to cut the jacket around its circumference
so that it can be removed from the optical fiber contained within the cable.Previously, jackets were not stripped from fiber optic cables. Due to the danger
of damaging the fiber within the cable, the jacket was manufactured to the desired
length and the fiber was then inserted into the pre-defined length of jacket. This is in
contrast to a method utilized for obtaining a desired length of jacket for a cable that
contains a copper conductor. In the copper cable context, a tool could be utilized to
strip a portion of the jacket off of the cable by engaging the jacket with the tool and
exerting a pulling force with the tool on the jacket to strip the jacket portion from the
copper cable. The tool is pulled along the copper cable's longitudinal axis, with the
tool engaging the jacket, until the jacket portion is removed from around the conductor.
Tools as advertised in Techni-ToolÂ®, catalog 61, page 55, as "Precision Wire Strippers",
product numbers 217ST756, 217ST757, and 217ST3757 can be utilized to strip a jacket
from a copper cable conductor. If a similar method with the tools was utilized for
removing a jacket from a fiber optic cable the relatively fragile fiber, as contrasted to
the copper cable conductor, would break due to the pulling force that would be exerted
on the jacket, and consequently the optical fiber, by the tool.Additionally, it was not thought that the copper cable stripping tools themselves 
could be used to strip a jacket from a fiber optic cable. The electrical cable contains a
copper conductor that is, in comparison to an optical fiber conductor, rugged and
generally unaffected by physical imperfections in the outer circumference of the
conductor. Thus, when stripping an outer jacket from a copper conductor, if the
stripping tool's cuffing surfaces contact the conductor during the process, even if they
cut into the surface of the conductor, little damage is done to the transmission capacity
of the conductor. However, the same result would not be expected if an optical fiber
was contacted by the cutting surfaces of a stripping tool. Therefore, it was not thought
