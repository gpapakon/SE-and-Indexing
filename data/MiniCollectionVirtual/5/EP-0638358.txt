<ABSTRACT>
The vortex packing for an apparatus designed as a mass exchange column or static mixer is constructed from planar structural elements. These structural elements define a point lattice whose lattice planes lying in apparatus cross-sections form basic grids of rectangles. The rectangles each represent an equatorial periphery of an octahedron and the polar points of these octahedrons lie on the points of the adjacent lattice planes. The octahedrons either have sides which are all open or have alternating open and closed sides. According to the invention, the packing is constructed from layers (3) arranged in parallel each of which are composed of a film-like material having essentially triangular elementary regions (8, 9). Some of these elementary triangles (9) have cut edges (30) on each of two sides and are folded out from the film surface about folded edges (15) in the form of tabs. The structural elements of the packing result from pairwise assignment or connection of the elementary triangles (8, 9).

A vortex packing for an apparatus constructed as a
mass exchange column or static mixer, having

structural elements (a, d, k, h) shaped as
parallelograms, which define a point lattice whose

lattice planes that lie in cross sections of the
apparatus form basic patterns of quadrilaterals,

wherein these quadrilaterals each represent an
equatorial circumference of an octahedron, the pole

tips of these octahedrons lie on the points of the
adjacent lattice planes and the octahedrons have

either all open sides or alternately open and closed
sides, wherein moreover the packing is constructed

from foil-like material, which forms layers and sets
bases (3; 4; 5) which can be divided in a hexagonal

pattern into triangular elementary regions (8, 9),

characterised in that
 a part of the elementary
triangles (9) have cutting edges (30) at each of the

two sides and also are folded out like tabs from the
base around a third side, in particular around a

fold edge (15),
in that
 the structural elements (a, d, k, n) of the
packing are formed by paired association or

connection of elementary triangles (8, 9),
and in that
 moreover no openings shaped as
parallelograms are produced in the bases by removal

of material.
A vortex packing according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the foil-type material forms
a base (3) of the fold-out triangles (9) which

substantially coincides with a lattice plane (3*). 
A vortex packing according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the base (3) comprises a
slight pleating by virtue of pairs of pleated edges

(17a, 17b), the spacing of the pleated edges being
roughly 10 to 20 % of the side length of an

elementary triangle (8), the pleating angle (70)
being greater than roughly 145Â° and the pleated

edges each bordering strips of linearly disposed
elementary triangles.
A vortex packing according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the foil-type material forms
a base (4) of the folded-out elementary triangles

(9), which base comprises at least one fold edge
(11) by which a change of the base (4) from one

lattice plane, on which the base substantially lies,
to a second lattice plane occurs.
A vortex packing according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the base (4) has uniform zig-zag
pleating, the fold edges (11) in each case

bordering strips which comprise two parallel bands
with linearly disposed elementary triangles.
A vortex packing according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the base (5) has uniformly
zig-zag pleating, the fold edges (11, 12) each

bordering strips of linearly disposed elementary
triangles.
A vortex packing according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the foil-type material is
metallic or is made from a plastic material. 
Use of a vortex packing according to one of Claims
1 to 7 in a column for mass exchange and/or heat

exchange between a trickling film and a gas stream,
whereby for the purpose of uniform wetting a

horizontal channelling of the structural elements is
provided.
Use of a vortex packing according to one of Claims
1 to 7 in a reactor in which the packing is

constructed as a substrate for a catalyst.
Use of a vortex packing according to one of Claims
1 to 7 in a static mixer for fluid media.
