<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and a device for measuring the concentration of at least one substance contained in a complex medium, the device comprising at least one first enclosure (6) which has an inlet (25) and an outlet (26) and through which the said complex medium is intended to pass, a second enclosure (7), tangential filtration means (8) separating the first and second enclosures in order to permit a transfer by convection of at least a fraction of solutes contained in the complex medium from the first enclosure towards the second enclosure.

Method of measuring the concentration of at least one substance
contained in a complex medium moving into an internal circuit inside a

body (1) from an external circuit (2) outside said body derived from said
internal circuit, characterised in that it comprises at least the following

steps:

providing said external circuit in advance with at least a first chamber
(6), the interior walls of which are impervious to said complex medium,

said first chamber being intended to be traversed by said complex
medium and comprising tangential filtration means, which are formed

from at least one hollow fibre (8), and which define the casing of a
second chamber (7) separated from said first chamber and contained in

said first chamber,
establishing a pressure of said complex medium in said first chamber

higher than the pressure of gravity and the pressure prevailing in said
second chamber to ensure a transfer by convection of at least a fraction

of solutes of said complex medium from said first chamber to said
second chamber,
analysing at least said fraction of solutes collected in said second
chamber and/or measuring the concentration of at least one constituent

substance.
Method of measuring the concentration of at least one substance
contained in a complex medium moving into an internal circuit inside a

body from an external circuit (2) outside said body derived from said
internal circuit, characterised in that it comprises at least the following

steps: 

providing said external circuit in advance with at least a first chamber
(6), the interior walls of which are impervious to said complex medium,

said first chamber being intended to be traversed by said complex
medium and comprising tangential filtration means, which are formed

from at least one hollow fibre (8) and which define the casing of a
second chamber (7) separated from said first chamber and contained in

said first chamber,
establishing a pressure in said second chamber lower than the pressure
of said complex medium circulating in said first chamber, by suction, to

ensure a transfer by convection of at least a fraction of solutes of said
complex medium from said first chamber to said second chamber,
analysing at least said fraction of solutes collected in said second
chamber and/or measuring the concentration of at least one constituent

substance.
Method characterised in that it comprises a combination of the
methods according to claims 1 and 2.
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that said
body consists of a human body (1), said complex medium comprising

blood.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that said derived
external circuit comprises an extra-corporal blood circuit (2), for

example for haemodialysis.
Method according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that it
comprises using said first chamber (6) as a bubble trap. 
Method according to claims 1 and 5 or claims 1 and 6,
characterised in that said higher pressure in said first chamber (6),

compared with that prevailing in said second chamber (7), is ensured by
a circulation pump (3) circulating the blood of said circuit for

haemodialysis (2).
Apparatus for measuring the concentration of at least one
substance contained in a complex medium, which apparatus permits a

method according to one of claims 1 to 7 to be accomplished,
characterised in that it comprises a first chamber (6), the interior walls of

which are impervious to said complex medium, and which chamber
comprises an inlet (25) and an outlet (26) for a continuous flow of said

complex medium, a second chamber (7) separated from said first
chamber and contained in said first chamber, at least one hollow fibre (8)

for separating said first and second chambers and defining the casing of
said second chamber (7), means for establishing a pressure difference

between said first and second chambers to permit a transfer by
convection of at least a fraction of solutes contained in said complex

medium from said first chamber to said second chamber, and means (9,
11) for analysing and/or for measuring at least said fraction of solutes

collected in said second chamber.
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that a first end
(20) of said hollow fibre (8) is connected to a casing (5), the interior of

which defines said first chamber (6), the second end (22) of said hollow
fibre (8) also being connected to said casing (5), to establish a flow of 

said fraction of solutes into a line (17) through said first and second ends
of the hollow fibre (8) at the same time.
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that said hollow
fibre (8) is blocked at a first of its ends (20).
Apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 10, characterised in that
said first chamber is configured as a bubble trap.
Apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 11, characterised in that
said second chamber (7) communicates with sample removing means

(16).
Apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 12, characterised in that
said means for establishing a pressure difference between said first and

second chambers comprise pumping means (3) for establishing a
pressure of said complex medium in said first chamber (6) higher than

the pressure prevailing in said second chamber (7).
Apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 13, characterised in that
said means for establishing a pressure difference between said first and

second chambers comprise suction means (18) for establishing a pressure
in said second chamber (7) lower than the pressure of said complex

medium in said first chamber (6).
Filtration module incorporated in the composition of an apparatus

first chamber (6), the interior walls of which are impervious to said 
outlet (26) for a continuous flow of said complex medium, a second

chamber (7) separated from said first chamber and contained in said first
chamber, at least one hollow fibre (8) for separating said first and second

chambers and for defining the casing of said second chamber (7), to
permit a transfer by convection of at least a fraction of solutes contained

in said complex medium from said first chamber to said second chamber.
