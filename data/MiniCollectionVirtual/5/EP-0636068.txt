<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to foam grips.It is known in the art to provide articles which
are to be gripped with the fingers with resilient or
cushioned grips in order to improve the comfort of the user
of the article. In particular, finger manipulated articles,
such as writing instruments, have been provided with devices
designed to provide a comfortable gripping area, as
disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,932,800. Conventional
finger gripping devices typically provide a sleeve of
resilient compressible material, extending about or covering
a portion of the gripping area. This compressible material
is intended to deform on application of gripping pressure,
and at least partially conform to the shape of the fingers
during manipulation of the article. After removal of
gripping pressure, the compressible material returns to its
original shape.For additional information, see the following
references: U.S Patent US-A-4 474 276 which discloses a
sealing composition for preventing or inhibiting leaks;
German Patent DE-A-1 511 325 which discloses the use of a
sleeve on a writing instrument; U.S. Patent US-A-4 158 087
which discloses polyurethane foam compositions; U.S. Patent
US-A-4 725 627 which discloses a hand-squeezable toy with
dimensional memory; Japanese Patent J-A-56 081 345 which
discloses a plastic foam with uniform and fine open cells;
U.S. Patent US-A-4 098 506 a removable hand grip for use on
a tennis racket and the like; U.S. Patent US-A-4 932 800
which discloses a compressible finger-gripping device for
finger-manipulated articles; and British Patent GB-A-1 093
173 which discloses flexible polyurethane foams.In one aspect, the invention features a finger
manipulated article having a handle with a gripping surface
including a foam having a recovery rate of less than 10 cm
per minute, 
preferably less than 5 cm per minute, more
preferably less than 3 cm per minute.In another aspect, the invention
features a finger manipulated article having a
handle with a gripping surface including a foam
having a spring rate of between 250 and 20,000
grams per cm, preferably between 500 and 16,000
grams per cm.In another aspect, the invention
features a finger manipulated article having a
handle with a gripping surface including a foam
having a percent peak force of less than 95%,
preferably of less than 85%.In another aspect, the invention
features a finger manipulated article having a
handle with a gripping surface including a
polyurethane foam that was made from a mixture
including a latex or a filler, or
