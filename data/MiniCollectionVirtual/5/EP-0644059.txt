<ABSTRACT>
The invention intends to provide a 
seal manufacturing apparatus with which it 

is possible for a non-expert to simply form 
a desired seal, doorplate, nameplate and the 

like in a short time. In the seal manufacturing 
apparatus of the invention, a member 

(42b) of a resin, of which a portion or 
portions acted on by predetermined physical 

stimuli such as ultraviolet rays, laser beams 
and heat is changed to have a property different 

from that of other portions and of which 
either portion can be removed by an action 

with a predetermined fluid, is used as a seal 
face member (42), on which an imprint pattern 

of a seal is formed. In accordance with 
an imprint pattern of a seal taken in by information 

processing means, pattern transfer 
control means (20) controls as to application 

or non-application of physical stimuli to every 
predetermined minute unit area to exert 

on the seal face member of a resin physical 
stimuli corresponding to an imprint pattern 

of a seal so as to partially change a property 
of the seal face member. Then, a portion or 

portions, of which a property has changed, 
or portion or portions, of which a property 

has not changed, is removed by water and 
the like to provide a seal and an uneven patterned 

plate having a desired pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a seal making
device and more particularly to a seal making device, by
which a person other than an expert and a professional
can make a desired seal easily. In the instant
specification, the term "seal making device" should be
construed as including a relief or intaglio figure plate
making device for making a plate, one or both of the
front and back sides of which are engraved with relief or
intaglio figures or patterns.Seals in a broad sense, which include a seal
engraved with a person's surname or full name, a larger
stamp engraved with a mark indicating an office to which
individuals belong and a signet, are usually made by
experts or professionals. Further, no matter whether
such seals are hand-made or machine-made, each of them is
usually made by selectively incising a part of the
surface of one end of a cylindrical or plate-like body.Incidentally, a seal is sometimes made by forming,
for example, a mold of a resin, on a surface of which is
engraved with a relief or intaglio figure projecting or
hollowing in inverse relation to the unevenness of the 
intaglio or relief figure engraved on a surface of the
seal, and thereafter injecting a fluid material such as
rubber into the mold and then solidifying the fluid
material to form an engraved member having substantially
the same unevenness as such an intaglio figure.However, there are many kinds of seals which
corporations and individuals wish to have. For instance,
a seal indicating an addressee to which letters are
frequently mailed, a stamp indicating a title of account,
and a seal which is given to a new employee, are often
required by them. In case of requesting an expert or a
professional to make such a seal, stamp or badge, money
matters and the term of making a seal or the like
sometimes come into problem.Further, recently, relief or intaglio figures are
sometimes formed on the surfaces of, for example, a door-plate
mounted on a door of a person's private room, a
plate put up at an entrance of a building and a
decoration worn on a person's chest, similarly as in the
aforesaid cases of the seals or the like. In such cases,
similar matters and problems often occur.Therefore, there is a demand for a person other than
an expert and a professional to make a desired seal or
the like easily. Previously, a seal making device
(strictly speaking, a seal making kit), by which a person
other than an expert and a professional can make a seal,
has been on the market. U.S. Patent No. 4,714,957 discloses: (1) an apparatus
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for making a seal which comprises an image data outputting
means (10, 20) for outputting an image data, a seal face member (42)

composed of a photosensitive resin layer, a light source portion (50) disposed
oppositely to the photosensitive resin layer, a liquid crystal panel portion (51)

disposed between the light source portion (50) and the seal face member (42)
for transferring the image data outputted from the image data outputting means

(10, 20), and a lens means (52) disposed between the liquid crystal panel
portion (51) and the photosensitive resin layer for converging onto the

photosensitive resin layer light rays emitted from the light source portion (50)
and transmitted through the liquid crystal panel portion (51),
characterized in that

said photosensitive resin layer is composed of an ultraviolet setting resin layer
(42b), said image data outputting means comprises imprint figure information

generating means (10, 20) for generating imprint figure information and control
means (20) for controlling said liquid crystal panel portion (51) so as to transfer

imprint figure information onto the ultraviolet setting resin layer (42b) by

basis of the imprint figure information generated from said imprint figure
information generating means (10, 20), that said light source portion (50)

comprises an ultraviolet irradiating light source (501), a visible light irradiating
source (502), and a mirror (503) disposable relative to the ultraviolet irradiating

light source (501) and the visible light irradiating light source (502) so as to

characterized in that

the imprint figure information generating means (10, 20) comprises an imprint
light source (90) for emitting light rays having wavelengths which are within a

predetermined range, a light scanning portion (510) for causing light emitted
from the imprint light source (90) to scan the sheet, and photoelectric
