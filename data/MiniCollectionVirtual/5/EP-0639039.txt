<ABSTRACT>
The controller for the illumination is programmed in such a manner that the room probes (sensors, push-button switches) are initially allocated in a computer, in each case via input masks, to illumination groups. After this, functions are assigned to each illumination group. On the bases of these input values, the computer automatically produces the control program for the controller by combining existing software modules. In this way, the control programme can be established in a very time-saving and cost-effective manner.
