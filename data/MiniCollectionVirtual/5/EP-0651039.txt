<ABSTRACT>
High-solids air-drying or semi-drying alkyd paints essentially comprise, as 
binder, a conventional air-drying or semi-drying long-oil or medium-oil 

alkyd resin, and as reactive diluent an oligomer of polyol, polyisocyanate 
and unsaturated fatty acids. Use of the oligomer as reactive diluent is 

also claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air-drying or semi-drying alkyd paints.
More particularly, it relates to high-solids alkyd paints.Environmental concern during the last years has led to a considerable
demand for paints with a higher solids content. As used herein,
high-solids refers to coatings with at most about 250g/l of volatile
organic compounds (VOC).High solids paints have long been known. However, they did not have the
performances of the presently known paints that have a higher solvent
content. There is thus a demand for high-solids paints that have
performances at least as good as those which everyone is presently
expecting in the art.The concept of reactive diluent is known in the art of high-solids paints
(see e.g. Chapter 6 in High Solids Alkyd Resins, K.Holmberg, Dekker, 1987).
EP-357128-A discloses an alkyd-type reactive diluent. EP-301345-A discloses
a polyesterurethane containing ether groups and prepared from an isocyanate
containing at least one copolymerisable double or triple carbon-carbon
bond, used as reactive diluent for oxidatively drying binders. US-4609706
discloses the use of hydroxy-functional oligomer reacted with a compound
containing both one ethylenic unsaturation and one isocyanate functionality
as reactive diluent for drying oil modified alkyd resin. However, the performances obtained are insufficient, and there is a need in
the art for high-solids air-drying or semi-drying paints having better
properties.It is an object of this invention to provide air-drying or semi-drying
alkyd paints of higher solids content.Another object of the invention is to provide air-drying or semi-drying
alkyd paints of higher hiding power.Still another object of the invention is to provide air-drying or
semi-drying alkyd paints having improved drying properties.Yet another object is to provide air-drying or semi-drying alkyd paints
which can be applied in thicker layers without sagging.A further object is to provide air-drying or semi-drying alkyd paints
having an improved balance of the above objects.Still a further object of the invention is to provide a reactive diluent
that can be used in combination with conventional air-drying or semi-drying
long-oil or medium-oil alkyd resins to formulate high-solids air-drying or
semi-drying alkyd paints meeting one or more of the above objects. Accordingly, the high-solids air-drying or semi-drying alkyd paints of the
invention essentially comprise as binder a conventional air-drying or
semi-drying long-oil or medium-oil alkyd resins. Alkyd resins

<CLAIMS>
High-solids air-drying or semi-drying alkyd paints essentially
comprising


(i) as binder, a conventional air-drying or semi-drying long-oil
or medium-oil alkyd resin
(ii) as reactive diluent, an oligomer which can be prepared by the
reaction of a polyol, fatty acids and a polyisocyanate, the

polyol having between 3 and 10 free alcohol groups and at most
one ether group, the fatty acids having an iodine index greater

than 125 and being used in an amount of from 0.70 to 0.80 mole
per equivalent of alcohol group in the polyol, the polyisocyanate

containing no copolymerisable c-c bond and being used in an
amount of from 0.20 to 0.10 equivalent of isocyanate per

equivalent of alcohol group in the polyol, such as to obtain an
isocyanate number equal to zero, acid number below 10, hydroxyl

number between 10 and 30 and a viscosity comprised between 1 and
30 dPa.s.
(iii)at least one drier,
(iv) and, if appropriate, solvents/diluents, pigments, dyes, fillers
and auxiliaries in amounts such that the paints have a volatile

organic compound content of at most 250 g/l.
Paints according to claim 1, wherein the oligomer is prepared from a
polyol having 6 free alcohol groups.
Paints according to either of claims 1 and 2, wherein the oligomer is
prepared from a polyisocyanate having 2 isocyanate groups. 
Paints according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the oligomer is
prepared from fatty acids having an iodine index greater than 140.
Paints according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the oligomer has
a viscosity comprised between 10 and 20 dPa.s.
Paints according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the weight ratio
of binder to reactive diluent is of from 9:1 to 5:5.
Paints according to claim 6, wherein the weight ratio of binder to
reactive diluent is of about 2:1.
Paints according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
they have a viscosity of from 5 to 15 dPa.s.
Paints according to any one of claims 1 to 8 characterized in that
they have a volatile organic compounds content of at most 100 g/l.
Use as reactive diluent in high-solids alkyd paints based on
air-drying or semi-drying long-oil or medium-oil alkyd resins of an

oligomer which can be prepared as described in claims 1 to 5.
