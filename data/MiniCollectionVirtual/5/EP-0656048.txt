<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
softener composition for clothes which can impart an
excellent softness and antistatic properties to
various fibers.During repeated wear and laundering, fiber-treatments
are washed away from clothes, or fibers
become hardened due to the deterioration of the fibers
per se, which results in undesirable changes in the
texture of the fibers or fabric. In recent years,
therefore, softeners capable of imparting softness and
antistatic properties to fibers have been widely used
for domestic purposes.Most of the household softeners marketed today
comprise a cationic surfactant having 1 or 2
long-chain alkyl groups and a quaternary ammonium
group per molecule (hereinafter referred to as a
quaternary ammonium salt), in particular, a
di(hardened beef tallow alkyl)dimethylammonium salt as 
the main component.The softening effect of such a softener is
exhibited by a decrease in the coefficient of friction
on the surface of the fiber due to the lubricating
effect of lipophilic sites in molecules of the base,
i.e., the above-mentioned cationic surfactant,
adsorbed on the surface of the fiber. However, it is
unavoidable that a softener base having an excellent
softening effect gives a sticky feeling, i.e., a
so-called greasy feeling, to the clothes to be treated
therewith. The extent of this greasy feeling varies
depending on, for example, the type of fibers to be
treated with the softener and the knitting technique.
Generally, underwear such as plain-knitted cotton
underwear and nylon tricot slip which is brought into
direct contact with the skin, and towels with which
the hands directly come into contact and of which the
texture can be sensitively felt, are often evaluated
as having a greasy feeling or an extremely oily
feeling as a result of the softening treatment. When
such a softener is used at a high concentration, this
greasy feeling becomes more serious, though the
softening effect is enhanced thereby. It has been
therefore believed that the softening effect of the
conventional softener compositions comprising a 
quaternary ammonium salt is correlated with this
greasy feeling.Under these circumstances, there have been
proposed softener compositions containing a quaternary
ammonium salt together with various additives, for
example, a softener composition containing an acyclic
quaternary ammonium salt, a specific poly-quaternary
ammonium salt and a nonionic compound [see U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,126,562 (patented on Nov. 21, 1978; assignee:
