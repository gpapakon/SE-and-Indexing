<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel diphenylpiperazine 
derivative or its salts having a strong 
antagonism against calcium, and to a drug for circulatory 
organs containing the diphenylpiperazine derivative or its 
salts for use in the cure and prevention of a variety of 
circulatory organ diseases. Conventionally, a variety of drugs have been 
developed and clinically used for the cure and prevention 
of circulatory organ diseases. Among them, an antagonism 
against calcium particularly inhibits inflow of calcium 
ions into cells, which is caused by excitation of a cell 
membrane of cardiac muscle or vascular smooth muscle, 
controls contraction of such muscle and promotes 
vasodilation. A calcium antagonism, therefore, is useful 
for the cure and prevention of hypertension, angina 
pectoris, cerebral circulatory disturbances and the like, 
and attracting attention. As typical examples of such a calcium antagonism,  
 
furnarizine clinically applied as a cerebral circulation 
accelerator, cinnarizine clinically applied as an 
angiotelectasis agent, and the like are known. However, 
development of a new medicament, which has an antagonism 
against calcium with less side effect, has still been 
desired. Accrodingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a novel compound which possesses an excellent 
antagonism against calcium and is useful as a drug, and a 
drug containing this compound for circulatory organs. Under such circumstances, the present inventors have 
carried out extensive studies and have found that a novel 
diphenylpiperazine derivative represented by general 
formula (1) as described hereinafter and its salts possess 
a strong antagonism against calcium compared with 
furnarizine or cinnarizine conventionally used, a less 
toxicity and a high safety and is widely applicable as a 
drug for circulatory organs. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
diphenylpiperazine derivative represented by the following 
general formula (1) or its salts and a drug for 
circulatory organs, containing this compound as an active 
ingredient:  [wherein, R¹ and R² are the same or different and 
indipendently represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, 
an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a nitro group, an amino 
group, a hydroxy group, an optionally esterified carboxyl 
group or a trifluoromethyl group; R³ represents a hydrogen 
atom, an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, an acyl group, a 
nitro group or an optionally esterified carboxymethyl 
group; Ar represents a phenyl or naphthyl
