<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to swellable, infusible, solvent-insoluble, 
tack-free, elastomeric acrylate microspheres, a method for producing such 
microspheres, and suspensions containing such microspheres. Tacky, elastomeric, acrylate microspheres are well known and 
numerous references concern the preparation and/or use of these inherently 
tacky, elastomeric acrylate polymeric microspheres. Such solid spheres and 
their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,691,140 (Silver), assigned 
to the assignee of the present case. These microspheres are prepared by 
aqueous suspension polymerization of alkyl acrylate monomers and ionic 
comonomers, e.g., sodium methacrylate, in the presence of an emulsifier, 
preferably an anionic emulsifier. The use of a water-soluble, substantially 
oil-insoluble ionic comonomer is critical to preventing coagulation or 
agglomeration of the microspheres. U.S. Patent No. 4,166,152 (Baker et al.) 
also describes solid, inherently tacky (meth)acrylate microspheres which are 
prepared by an alternative method; in this case from alkyl acrylate or 
methacrylate monomer(s) in the presence of both an emulsifier and an ionic 
suspension stabilizer having an interfacial tension sufficient to prevent 
microsphere agglomeration. Baker et al. discloses that through the addition of 
an oil soluble and non-ionic copolymerizable monomer, such as divinylbenzene, 
to the microsphere composition, the tack of the acrylate microspheres can be 
varied. Hollow inherently tacky, elastomeric acrylate microspheres and 
methods for their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5.045,569 
(Delgado), assigned to the assignee of the present case. These hollow 
microspheres, which have a diameter of at least 1 micrometer and at least one 
internal void, are prepared from alkyl acrylate or methacrylate monomer(s) and, 
optionally, at least one polar comonomer in the presence of an emulsifier 
having the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value sufficient to allow the formation 
of cavity-containing droplets. Delgado also discloses that the composition of 
these tacky, hollow microspheres can also contain a multifunctional  
 
(meth)acrylate crosslinking agent, such as 1,4-butanediol diacrylate or 
1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, or other multifunctional crosslinking agents, such as 
divinylbenzene. DE 3,544,882 A1 (Nichiban) describes crosslinked microspheres 
composed of 90 to 99.5 weight percent of (meth)acrylate ester and 10 to 0.5 
weight percent of vinyl type monomer, e.g., acrylic acid, having a
