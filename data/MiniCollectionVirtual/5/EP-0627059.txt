<ABSTRACT>
Silencer comprising an elongated housing (2) which has an inlet (3) and an outlet (4). A sound-absorbent element (5), which comprises a transverse baffle (6) which does not extend to the side walls of the housing (2), is fitted in the housing (2). Longitudinal plates (7) are fitted at the ends of the transverse baffle (6) and adjoining the latter. A silencing gap (14) is delimited along the longitudinal plates (7) and the housing (2). The cross-sectional surface area of the gap (14) is less than 15% of the total cross-sectional surface area of the housing (2) at the location of said gap (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silencer of the type specified in the preamble of
Claim 1. A silencer of this type is disclosed in US-A-3.361.227. The silencer described
and illustrated in said patent is particularly suitable for silencing the exhaust sound from
a combustion engine. Because the efficiency of combustion engines is of considerable
importance, a balance must be sought between silencing of the sound and impedance of
the gas flow. Silencing of parts of the audio spectrum which are not covered by the
silencer in question is provided by additional silencers connected up- or downstream.
The effort involved in this type of construction is, on the one hand, justified by the
reduced loss which occurs as a result and, on the other hand, possible because,
especially, in vehicles, a long length is available for the installation of such silencers.Silencers of this type are unsuitable for compressed air compressors. In the prior
art silencers lined with sound-absorbent material are used for compressed air
compressors. Silencers of this type have the advantage that a broad audio spectrum can
be covered by a single silencer. In this context efficient silencing is more important than
the impedance of the gas flow because it is possible to compensate for losses in flow in
a simple manner, for example by increasing the power of the motor which drives the
compressor. However, the use of silencers lined with glass wool or another absorbent
material has the disadvantage that silencers of this type can no longer be cleaned such
that they meet the demands of the foodstuffs industry and hospitals. Frequently the
minimum requirement for these sectors is that the silencers can be sterilised of flushed
with a liquid disinfectant.The object of the present invention is to provide a silencer which does not have
the abovementioned disadvantages. This object is achieved by means of a silencer
described above which has the characterising features of Claim 1.The invention is based on the perception of incorporating only plates. baffles and
other components which can be sterilised easily. In addition, the design of the sound-absorbent
element is such that silencing of, in particular, the low frequency sound
produced by the compressor can be provided to a great extent. According to an
advantageous embodiment of the invention. the free cross-sectional surface area
between the plate and the housing makes up between 8 and 12% of the given total
cross-sectional surface area. Although the gap between housing and plate can be
