<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a vaccine 
comprising antigenic substance and an adjuvant, a 
method for the preparation of such a vaccine and an 
adjuvant composition. Most diseases in aquaculture are caused by 
opportunistic pathogens, i.e. bacteria which cause 
disease when the fish or shrimp are weakened or 
stressed. This is a situation which often exists under 
practical farming conditions. Bacteria which are threat to commercial 
aquaculture are for example, Yersina ruckeri, the 
causal agent of enteric redmouth disease; Vibrio 
anguillarum, the causal agent of classical vibriosis; 
Vibrio salmonicida which causes cold water vibriosis, 
Aeromonas salmonicida which causes furunculosis, and 
Renibacterium Salmoniarum the causative agent of 
bacterial kidney disease. The use of vaccines and antibiotics are the two 
available methods to protect farmed fish against 
diseases. The use of antibiotics has to be 
considerably reduced in aquaculture to avoid 
enviromental hazards and the risk of the development 
of antibiotic resistence. For some bacterial fish pathogens the use of 
(experimental) vaccines have been reported (Holm, K.O. 
et al., J. Fish Diseases 11, 389-396, 1987; Rørstad, 
G. et al., Conference on Diseases in Asian 
Aquaculture, Nov. 1990, Indonesia).  However, a need exists to further improve the 
vaccine efficacy against some of the above mentioned 
pathogens. Moreover, no efficient vaccine exists yet 
against such commercially important diseases as 
furunculosis and bacterial kidney disease in 
salmonids, and against viral diseases. For example, a 
threat to commercial aquaculture is represented by 
Aeromonas salmonicida. The vaccination against this 
pathogen with killed bacteria result in only poor 
protection, probably because of the poor 
immunogenicity of the antigens of the inactivated 
bacteria. Therefore, with such inactivated vaccines there 
is a constant need for enhancing the immunogenicity of 
the antigens, e.g. by means of adjuvants. Presently, there are several oil-adjuvated 
vaccines commercially available in Norway, two of 
these are tri-valent vaccines (Apoject 3-Fural, 
Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S.; Biojec 1900, Biomed 
Inc). These are tri-valent vaccines comprising 
inactivated whole bacteria used fur the protection 
against vibriosis, coldwater vibriosis and 
furunculosis in salmon. A disadvantage of these vaccines is their 
relatively poor efficacy against furunculosis and less 
favourable physical properties, in particular 
viscosity or stability of the
