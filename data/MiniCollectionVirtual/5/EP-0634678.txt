<ABSTRACT>
An outer member has a number of non-linearly arrayed grooves at one end to receive individual jacketed optic fibers of a fibre optic harness. The outer member has a slot at the other end to receive a linear array of a corresponding number of unjacketed optic fibre end portions of the jacketed optic fibres abutting one another. Each groove converges toward and communicates with the slot. An inner wedge member is disposed in the one end of the outer member for guiding the holding the individual jacketed optic fibres in the respective grooves. The inner wedge member has a inner end that is spaced from an inner end of the slot. The grooves are arranged in at least two rows. The inner wedge member has a corresponding number of grooves.
