<ABSTRACT>
A system for managing a telemarketing complex is 
disclosed wherein the probability of meeting a given 

performance objective by the agents servicing an automatic 
call distributor (ACD) within the complex is computed for 

each subinterval of a predetermined service interval. This 
probability is then compared with threshold levels in order 

to determine whether the ACD requires that calls be shifted 
to meet the performance objective or whether calls can be 

accepted by that ACD. A record is maintained for each 
subinterval of the probabilities computed for that 

subinterval and as to whether the system succeeded or failed 
in achieving the performance objective at the end of the 

service interval. This record is used to compute the 
threshold levels used in future comparisons. In addition, 

the system computes a line-estimation factor which when 
multiplied by the number of agents working can be used to 

estimate the call load for an ACD.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telemarketing complex 
performance management systems and more particularly to 
telemarketing complex performance management systems wherein 
threshold levels are set in order to determine when to 
reroute traffic so as to balance service levels among 
automatic call distributors or to implement changes in the 
staffing force at selected traffic centers where calls are 
received. In a telemarketing complex performance management 
system (TCPMS), the telemarketing complex is managed by a 
system that compiles and processes data obtained from 
customer premises -based information sources as well as 
public switched telecommunications network-based information 
sources, such that service levels can be balanced among 
telecommunications centers (TCs) in the complex. Typically, 
the telemarketing complex is comprised of a plurality of 
automatic call distributors (ACDs) and a plurality of data 
centers that may be selectively linked to the TCs where the 
telemarketer receives calls. The system typically includes 
the following elements: (1) an interface to the network that 
reports the origin and destination of each of a plurality of 
calls received by the telemarketer at all locations; (2) an 
interface to the network that enables the telemarketer to 
affect changes in call processing logic; and (3) a traffic 
control center processor (TCCP) that accepts input data from 
all other elements of the system. The system accumulates 
data at the TCCP from each ACD and telemarketer database 
located at a data center (DC), while contemporaneously 
monitoring both the origins and destinations of the 
plurality of calls received at each ACD as well as the  
 
initiation of changes in call processing logic. The system 
analyzes the data to generate signals for implementing call 
routing changes needed to balance service levels among the 
ACDs or changes in the staffing force levels at selected TCs 
where calls are received. The process is accomplished in 
real time and is repeated at a desired frequency. In U.S. Patent 5,164,983 issued No. 17, 1992 to P. 
B. Brown et al., a telemarketing complex performance 
management system (TCPMS) is described wherein the 
telemarketing customer is required to select a performance 
objective which is desired to be satisfied over a selected 
service interval. In the Brown et al. system, the 
performance objective is the average speed of answer (ASA) 
by the staff at a given ACD which is servicing an operation 
being performed by the telemarketing complex. A
