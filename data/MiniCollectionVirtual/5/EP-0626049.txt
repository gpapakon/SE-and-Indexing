<ABSTRACT>
A pilot diaphragm valve (10) for a pulsator in a milking plant comprising a piston diaphragm valve (11), wherein the position of a piston (12) is determined by the pressure on a diaphragm (14) and wherein a diaphragm chamber (22a) on one side of the diaphragm communicates with the pilot valve (13). A toggle arm (26) is arranged in a wall of the pilot valve chamber, and one end of said toggle arm forms a movable valve member (26a) adapted to alternately open and close a vacuum inlet and an air inlet (42, 46). The other end (26b) of the toggle arm protrudes out of the valve chamber (25) and engages a displaceable slider (28) comprising a plurality of permanent magnets (31) mounted in such a manner that two magnetic poles of the same type face each other and may slide into a coil (32) adapted to be connected to an electronic circuit being able to supply the coil with current pulses, the direction of which may alternate at the desired frequency for changing the pressure on the teat cup of the milking machine between vacuum and atmospheric pressure. As a result, a current controlled valve having very small electric power consumption is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pilot diaphragm valve, 
particularly for a pulsator, comprising a piston 
diaphragm valve of the type stated in the preamble to 
claim 1 for a milking plant Such valves are known from GB-A-2 095 528. The position 
of the valve members are controlled by electromagnets. 
At the use of such valve it is essential to minimize the 
power consumption of the electromagnets. According to the invention a pilot diaphragm valve is 
provided, in particular for a pulsator comprising a piston 
diaphragm valve, wherein the position of a piston is 
determined by the pressure on a diaphragm and wherein a 
diaphragm chamber on one side of the diaphragm is connected 
to the chamber of a pilot valve by means of an 
air conduct, said pilot chamber having a first and a 
second inlet with a first and second pressure, respectively, 
and wherein a movable valve member is arranged 
for alternately closing the first and second inlet, said 
valve furthei comprising a cylinder provided with a coil 
form having a coil adapted to be connected to an electronic 
circuit being able to supply said coil with current 
pulses, the direction of which may alternate at a 
predetermined frequency and wherein all of the valve 
members are made of an essentially non-magnetic material 
such as plastics.  
 The valve is characterised in that a toggle arm is tiltably 
arranged in or adjacent a wall of the pilot valve 
chamber, one end of said toggle arm forming the movable 
valve member and the other end protruding out through 
the wall and engaging a displaceable slider comprising a 
plurality of permanent magnets mounted in a series, 
wherein two magnetics poles of the same type face each 
other, said slider arranged so as to slide in the cylinder. 
As the magnetic core comprises permanent magnets 
being mounted with opposite polarity, the tractive effort 
curve of the magnetic core is a relatively flat 
curve in the entire area of motion. By using a toggle 
arm it is possible to incorporate a gearing in the system. 
A considerable advantage of the new construction 
is that the sliders carrying the permanent magnets may 
be displaced by supplying the colis with relatively weak 
current pulses, whereby the power consumption (the current 
pulses through the coil) is considerably smaller 
than at known systems. In a perferred embodiment of the invention three magnets 
are arranged in the cylinder, the two upper magnets 
having poles of the same type facing each other through 
an intermediate layer of a non-magnetic
