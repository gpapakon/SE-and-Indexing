<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous ambient dry paint coating based on an 
addition copolymer matrix polymer containing an oligomer 

selected from a polyurethane or a polyester having a Tg 
below -20
o
C and a number average molecular weight between 
200 and 20,000, where the coating is free of organic 

coalescing solvents. The matrix polymer comprises emulsion 
copolymerized ethylenic monomers. In a preferred process, 

the oligomer is produced by forming an aqueous micro-preemulsion 
of oligomer in water by high shear mixing of 

oligomer and water containing 40% to 70% by weight oligomer 
and at temperatures between about 20
o
C and 100
o
C to provide 
an aqueous pre-emulsion having an organic phase droplet 

size less than 10 microns. The polymeric binder can be 
produced also by mixing the oligomer with the ethylenic 

monomers to form an organic mixture of monomer and 
oligomer, providing an aqueous micro dispersion of the 

organic mixture phase droplet size less than 5 microns, and 
copolymerizing the monomer to produce a vinyl acetate 

polymer containing oligomer. The polymeric binder system 
is free of coalescing organic solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to air dry emulsion paints based
on emulsion polymeric binders and more particularly to odour-free,
consumer latex paints free of polluting offensive
odouriferous coalescing solvents.Paint coatings are surface protective coatings applied to
substrates, dried to form continuous films for decorative
purposes as well as to protect the substrate. Consumer paint
coatings are air-drying aqueous coatings applied at ambient
temperatures, primarily to architectural interior or exterior
surfaces, where the coatings are sufficiently fluid to flow
out, form a continuous paint film, and dry at ambient
temperatures to protect the substrate surface.In contrast, automotive paint coating procedures ensure
sufficient flow-out to form a continuous film by baking the
coating at elevated temperatures, (typically 80 to 150°C, see
EP 0 401 565A page 8 lines 55 to 56), but of course such
baking is not possible when painting buildings. A paint coating ordinarily comprises an organic polymeric
binder, pigments, and various paint additives. In dried paint
films, the polymeric binder functions as a binder for the
pigments and provides adhesion of the dried paint film to the
substrate. The pigments may be organic or inorganic and
functionally contribute to opacity and color in addition to
durability and hardness, although some paint coatings contain
little or no opacifying pigments and are described as clear
coatings. The manufacture of paint coatings involves the
preparation of a polymeric binder, mixing of component
materials, grinding of pigments in a dispersant medium, and
thinning to commercial standards.Latex paints for the consumer market ordinarily are based
on polymeric binders prepared by emulsion polymerization of
ethylenic monomers. A typical consumer latex paint binder
contains a vinyl acetate copolymer consisting of polymerized
vinyl acetate (80%) and butyl acrylate (20%). The hardness of
the latex polymer must be balanced to permit drying and film
formation at low application temperatures, which requires soft
polymer units, while at the same time the polymer must be hard
enough in the final film to provide resistance properties
which requires hard polymer units. This is conventionally
accomplished by designing a latex polymer with a moderately
elevated Tg (glass transition temperature) but then lowering
the Tg temporarily with a volatile coalescing solvent.
Coalescing solvents function to externally and temporarily 
plasticize the latex polymer for time sufficient to develop
film formation,
