<ABSTRACT>
The present invention aims at increasing the divergence angle of a beam in the direction of a road surface in a short-range 
with an omnidirectional detection zone and without sacrificing the maximum detectable range. A double-focus lens is integrally 

formed with a short focal distance portion provided in the central part thereof and with a long focal distance portion provided at 
the circumferential part thereof, and a light source is disposed at a distance from the double-focus lens which is slightly shorter 

than the focal distance of the short focal distance portion of the double-focus lens. When the light from the light source is projected 
through the double-focus lens, the outgoing light from the short focal distance portion thereof which has a small divergence 

angle does not diverge greatly, so that it can be sent far away. On the other hand, the outgoing light from the long focal distance 
portion which has a large divergence angle diverges a little, so that it is sent to a short distance area, especially, to an area extending 

in the width direction of a road surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical radar apparatus,
and is used, for example, for a constant-speed traveling
apparatus and an optical radar apparatus capable of
accurately detecting the position of a vehicle, an obstacle
or the like moving closer to a detection-side vehicle.As optical radar apparatuses capable of setting a
detection area in a widthwise direction of a road surface,
there are apparatuses such as those disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model Laid-Open Nos. 59-117980 and 59-117981.In the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open No. 59-117980, shown in Figs. 7A and 7B, light from
a light source is condensed to some extent by a lens to
obtain a first detection range T1, and the light source is
suitably moved to obtain a second detection range T2 wider
than the first detection range T1 in a widthwise direction
of a road surface by changing the degree of condensing of the
lens.In the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open No. 59-117981, shown in Fig. 8, light from a light
source traveling through a lens is diffused by a prism to 
increase an expansion angle in a road surface direction,
thereby setting a detection range wide in a widthwise
direction of a road surface.In the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open No. 59-117980 among the above-described
conventional apparatuses, shown in Figs. 7A and 7B, however,
light cannot be emitted simultaneously for the first
detection range T1 and the second detection range T2, and
the detection range is set one-sidedly, since the detection
range is changed by moving the light source.The apparatus disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open No. 59-117981, shown in Fig. 8, entails the problem
of a reduction in the maximum detection distance because
light is uniformly diffused by the prism. Because of this
problem, it is not possible to meet a demand heretofore made
for widening the detection range in a widthwise direction of
a road surface in a short-distance area without reducing the
maximum detection distance when an optical radar apparatus is
used for an inter-vehicle control or an obstacle detecting
apparatus.The present invention has been achieved in consideration
of the above-described problems, and an object of the present
invention is to provide an optical radar apparatus capable of
increasing the expansion angle in a road surface direction in
a short-distance range without setting the detection range
one-sidedly and without sacrificing the maximum detection
distance. According to the present
