<ABSTRACT>
A baby carriage hood comprises a flexible cover 
mounted on a U-shaped frame member (28) which has each end 

secured to a respective side of the baby carriage body by 
a respective pivot joint. Each pivot joint (30) comprises 

a support member (40) adapted to be secured to the baby 
carriage, a shaft (44) fast with the support member (40), 

and an annular bracket (54) secured both to the U-shaped 
frame member (28) and to a locking member (52) connected to 

the shaft (44) by mutually engaging screw thread formations 
(46, 48). The bracket (54) and carries an annular wedge-shaped 

rib (58) arranged to engage in an annular groove 
(56) in the support member (40). Because of the screw-threaded 

connection between the shaft (44) and locking 
member (52), angular movement of the frame member (28) 

relative to the support member (40) varies the friction 
between the rib (58) and the groove (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a baby carriage hood of 
the type comprising a flexible cover mounted on a U-shaped 
frame member which has each end secured to a respective 
side of the baby carriage body by a respective pivot joint, 
each pivot joint comprising a support member adapted to be 
secured to the baby carriage, a shaft fast with the support 
member, a bracket secured to the U-shaped frame member and 
mounted on the shaft so that it is movable angularly and 
axially thereon and having a clamping surface adapted to 
engage with a complementary clamping surface on the support 
member to inhibit relative angular movement, and a locking 
member having a screw-thread adapted to engage with a 
complementary screw-thread on the shaft to urge the 
clamping surfaces into engagement with one another. A baby carriage hood of this type is disclosed in 
US-A-4809724. With this hood, it is necessary first to 
move the frame member to its deployed position and then to 
tighten the locking member of each pivot joint separately. 
The present invention provides a hood which can be deployed 
and clamped in its deployed position with a single 
movement. According to the invention, a baby carriage hood 
of the type described above has coupling means for coupling 
the bracket to the locking member for simultaneous angular 
movement so that angular movement of the bracket relative 
to the support member causes axial movement of the bracket 
relative to the support member to vary the friction between 
the clamping surfaces. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a pushchair 
fitted with a hood in accordance with the invention; Figure 2 is a side view of the joint connecting 
the hood to the pushchair on the left hand side thereof 
(when viewed from behind); Figure 3 is a sectional view taken on the line 3-3  
 
in Figure 2; and Figure 4 is a side view, similar to Figure 2, but 
with one component removed. Referring first to Figure 1, a pushchair is formed 
from two interconnected side frames, each having a 
respective front frame member 10, a respective rear frame 
member 12 and a respective bottom frame member 14 joining 
the bottom ends of the front and rear frame members 10 and 
12 and below which front and rear wheels 16 and 18 are 
mounted. The upper ends of the front and rear frame 
members 10 and 12 of each side frame are interconnected by 
respective limbs of a U-shaped handle 20. A luggage

<CLAIMS>
A baby carriage hood comprising a flexible cover 
(36) mounted on a U-shaped frame member (28) which has each 

end secured to a respective side of the baby carriage body 
by a respective pivot joint (30, 32), each pivot joint (30, 

32) comprising a support member (40) adapted to be secured 
to the baby carriage, a shaft (44) fast with the support 

member (40), a bracket (54) secured to the U-shaped frame 
member (28) and mounted on the shaft (44) so that it is 

movable angularly and axially thereon and having a clamping 
surface (56) adapted to engage with a complementary 

clamping surface (58) on the support member (40) to inhibit 
relative angular movement, and a locking member (52) having 

a screw-thread (48) adapted to engage with a complementary 
screw-thread (46) on the shaft (44) to urge the clamping 

surfaces (56, 58) into engagement with one another, 
characterised by coupling means (60-66) for coupling the 

bracket (54) to the locking member (52) for simultaneous 
angular movement so that angular movement of the bracket 

(54) relative to the support member (40) causes axial 
movement of the bracket (54) relative to the support member 

(40) to vary the friction between the clamping surfaces 
(56, 58). 
A baby carriage hood according to claim 1, wherein 
one of said clamping surfaces comprises an annular groove 

(56) with inwardly tapering walls, and the other of said 
clamping surfaces comprises a complimentary annular rib 

(58) of wedge-shaped cross-section shaped to engage in the 
groove. 
A baby carriage hood according to claim 1 or 2, 
further comprising means (60, 62, 64) for varying the 

angular position of the bracket (54) relative to the 
locking member (52) so as to permit variation of the 

friction between such bracket (54) and its support member 
(40) when the frame member (28) is in its fully deployed 

position.
