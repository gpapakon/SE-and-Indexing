<CLAIMS>
The use of mixtures containing 

(a) quaternized fatty acid trialkanolamine ester salts 
corresponding to formula (I): 


 
in which
 
R¹CO is a linear or branched aliphatic acyl radical 

containing 6 to 22 carbon atoms and 0 or 1 double 
bond, [Z]
 is an ethylene, propylene or isopropylene 
group and X is chloride, bromide, sulfate, methosulfate 

or phosphate, and 
(b) fatty alcohols and/or fatty alcohol polyglycol 
ethers 
 
for the production of hair rinses, hair-care emulsions, 

hair tonics, aerosol foams and setting lotions. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
R¹CO is an acyl radical containing 16 to 18 carbon atoms. 
The use claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that [Z]
 is an ethylene group. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that X represents methosulfate. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that ester salts corresponding to formula (I) are present 

in quantities of 0.1 to 25% by weight, based on the 
preparation. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the pH value is in the range from 2 to 5.
