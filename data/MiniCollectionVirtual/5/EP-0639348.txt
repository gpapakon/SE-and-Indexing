<ABSTRACT>
An abdominal lift for use in endoscopic 
surgery is described. The lift defines a substantial 

portion of a circle. It has a spoke portion and an 
upstanding member. Its surface may be mechanically 

compliant and may be coated with an adhesion prevention 
agent or a lubricous coating. The described method of 

use includes use of a starter lift followed by insertion 
of the abdominal lift. The abdominal lift is elevated 

to establish a pneumoperitoneum at or near ambient air 
pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical 
instruments and, more particularly, to an abdominal lift 
device for use in laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgical procedures have been 
around for many years and up until recently have become 
more available due to advances in technology relating to 
the laparoscope or video imaging system. They are much 
less intrusive to the patient than typical open surgical 
procedures. While an open surgical procedure may 
involve one primary incision that is at least 6-9 
centimeters long, a laparoscopic procedure typically 
uses smaller incisions, each only around 5-11 
millimeters in length. In open surgery, the surgeon 
cuts muscle. In laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon 
generally does not cut muscle. Because they are less 
intrusive than open surgical procedures, laparoscopic 
procedures have resulted in much shorter surgical 
procedures and recovery times. Laparoscopic procedures have typically 
involved insufflation of the abdominal or peritoneal 
cavity with carbon dioxide and/or other gases in order 
to create a pneumoperitoneum. The pneumoperitoneum 
establishes an open space inside the peritoneal cavity 
to enable the surgeon to move the laparoscope around and 
see inside. Typically, the pneumoperitoneum is established 
by puncturing the abdominal wall with a Veress needle 
and injecting gas from an insufflator through the Veress  
 
needle into the peritoneal cavity to a pressure of 
around 12 mm Hg. After insufflation, a trocar is advanced 
through the opening in the abdominal wall and into the 
peritoneal cavity. The trocar is a tube or cannula that 
usually has a gaseous seal to contain the carbon dioxide 
within the peritoneal cavity and maintain insufflation. 
The cannula is used for insertion of other medical 
instruments such as a laparoscope therethrough and into 
the peritoneal cavity. There may be certain difficulties associated 
with insufflation of the peritoneal cavity. First and 
foremost is postoperative pain which patients may 
experience in the abdomen or shoulder area due to 
migrating gas. This occurs when insufflation causes 
excess gas pressure in the peritoneal cavity. Excess 
gas pressure may also compress the pleural cavities thus 
making respiration difficult. Other possible 
difficulties associated with insufflation in 
laparoscopic surgery include subcutaneous emphysema, 
blood vessel penetration, etc. The attendant difficulties of insufflation 
have led to alternatives to insufflation wherein a 
pneumoperitoneum is
