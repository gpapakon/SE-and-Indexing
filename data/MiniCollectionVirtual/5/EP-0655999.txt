<ABSTRACT>
Novel 1,2,4-dithiazolium iodides of formula (I) in which R1 and R2 have the significance given in the application, process for producing them and their use as pesticides and novel initial compounds. The novel compounds of formula (I) can be produced by prior art processes, e.g. from suitable 3-alkylthio-1,2,4-dithiazolium iodides with suitable amines. The 3-alkylthio-1,2,4-dithiazolium iodides to be used are also novel and may be produced from 3-dimethylamino-1,2,4-dithiazoline-5-thione and alkyl iodides.
