<ABSTRACT>
By applying a voltage or signal and withdrawing or injecting, an electron or electrons to a layer of material (26, 26'), it is possible to write, erase or read data electrochemically. The layer of material has at least one portion that will reversibly change between charge states in response to the applied voltage or signal and the withdrawal or injection of an electron or electrons. Alternatively, the material of the layer may be such that the portion of the layer of material will dissociate into components in response to the applied voltage or signal and injection or withdrawal of an electron or electrons. The stored data may be read using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by applying a voltage or signal (40) thereto and detecting the current (i) through, voltage across or signal reflected from the layer to detect the different charge states or structures of different portions of the layer. The signal or voltage (702) applied can be a DC or AC signal, a signal pulse or transient or various combinations thereof. By using a material with more than two charge states or with multiple locations each with different charge states and by applying a signal with and detecting at a single or multiple frequencies, it is possible to write, erase or read multiple bits of information simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates in general to the
reading and writing of stored information and, in
particular, to a system for reading and writing stored
information through electrochemical changes.With the advent of instruments such as the
scanning tunneling microscope (STM), it is now possible
to investigate the structure, spectra and dynamics of
biological molecules and membranes as well as other
substances at the atomic or molecular level. While more
than a thousand STM's have been in operation and the
instrument has sparked great interest in spectroscopy,
the actual headway that has been made in this area
remains rather modest. Thus, Bob Wilson and co-workers
at IBM Almaden have made some progress in distinguishing
closely related adsorbed surface species in STM images.
G. Meijer et al., Nature 348, 621 (1990). In "Non-Linear
Alternating-Current Tunneling Microscopy,"
Kochanski, Physical Review Letters, 62:19, pp. 2285-2288
(May 1989), a method for scanning tunneling microscopy
is described, where a non-linear alternating current
(AC) technique is used that allows stable control of a
microscope tip above insulating surfaces where direct
current (DC) tunneling is not possible.The STM has a counter electrode on which the
sample to be investigated is placed and another electrode
in the shape of a microscope probe with a tip
placed at a small distance away from the sample surface.
A DC or a low frequency AC signal is then applied across 
the pair of electrodes. The probe tip is then moved
across the sample surface in a scanning operation and
the changes in the current or voltage across the
electrodes are monitored to detect the characteristics
of the sample.The distance between the probe tip and the
counter electrode/sample is controlled by a piezoelectric
driver in one of two possible modes: a constant
current mode and a constant height mode. The current or
voltage detected between the pair of electrodes is used
to derive a control signal for controlling the piezoelectric
driver in the constant current mode to change
the distance between the probe tip and the sample so as
to maintain a constant current between the electrodes.
The voltage that has been applied to the piezoelectric
driver in order to keep the tunneling current constant
indicates the height of the tip z(x,y) as a function of
the position (x,y) of the probe tip over the sample
surface. A record of such voltages therefore indicates
the topographical image of the sample surface. The
constant current mode can be used for surfaces which are
not
