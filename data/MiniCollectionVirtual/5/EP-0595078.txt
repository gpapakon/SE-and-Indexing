/g and containing from 1 to 20% by weight of aluminium oxide or from 1 to 20% by weight of silicon dioxide. It is prepared by vaporising aluminium chloride or silicon tetrachloride, transferring this together with an inert gas into the mixing chamber of a burner, mixing with hydrogen, air and gaseous titanium tetrachloride, burning the 4-component mixture in a reaction chamber and separating the titanium dioxide mixed oxide from the gaseous reaction products.

/g, 
which contains 1 to 30 wt.% aluminium oxide or 1 to 30 

wt.% silicon dioxide as a component of the mixed 
oxide. 
Process for the preparation of the titanium dioxide 
mixed oxide prepared by flame hydrolysis according to 

claim 1, characterised in that anhydrous aluminium 
chloride or silicon tetrachloride is evaporated, 

transferred into the mixing chamber of a known burner 
together with an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, mixed there 

with hydrogen, air and gaseous titanium tetrachloride 
in a ratio such that the correspondingly composed

the 4-component mixture is burnt in a reaction 

chamber, the solid titanium dioxide mixed oxide is 
then separated off from the gaseous reaction products 

and optionally freed from adhering hydrogen chloride 
in moist air. 
Use of the titanium dioxide mixed oxide prepared by 
flame hydrolysis according to claim 1 for the 

preparation of catalysts, catalyst supports, 
photocatalysts, ceramics, automotive coatings and 

cosmetic articles (especially sun screens) and as a 
heat stabiliser in silicone rubbers.
