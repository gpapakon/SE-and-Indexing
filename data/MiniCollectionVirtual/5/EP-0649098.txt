<ABSTRACT>
A computer interconnection system provides dynamic switch 
cascading with a plurality of circuit switches having 

circuit switch ports coupled by a dynamic connection to 
provide a dynamically cascadable switching network having a 

plurality of nodes, including end point and switch nodes. 
Two individual circuit switches of the network are interconnected 

by a cross-link group of one or more links. The 
system transmits frame information including a source 

endpoint address and a destination endpoint address, each 
of which can be associated with an endpoint port or a 

cross-link group, and forms a connection between an 
endpoint port or a cross-link group to make a connection 

between a circuit switch port corresponding to a source 
endpoint address and a circuit switch port corresponding to 

the destination endpoint. The dynamic circuit switch connections, 
as applicable to dynamic switch cascade operation, 

is compatible with the ESCON I/O Interface 
Architecture or to a fabric node supporting the Class 1 

service defined by the Fibre Channel ANSI Standard.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a system for making dynamic 
connections in a computer environment, and particularly to 
a system which provides dynamic cascading of multiple 
circuit switches interconnected via cross-links. While dictionary meanings are also implied by certain terms 
used here, the following glossary of some terms may be 
useful. 
1. The transmission medium is called a link. 2. Dynamic switch cascading is the interconnection of 
two or more dynamic switched using dynamic connections. 3. A dynamic switch cascade refers to a collection of 
dynamic switches interconnected to accomplish dynamic 
switch cascading. 4. A cross-link is a link used to interconnect two 
dynamic switches in order to accomplish dynamic switch 
cascading. 5. A cross-link group refers to the collection of 
cross-links between two individual dynamic switches. 6. There are two types of nodes, a dynamic switch node 
and an end-point node. A switch port refers to a link 
interface of a dynamic switch node and an end-point port 
refers to a link interface of an end-point node. A  
 
switch port is identified by a switch port number and an 
end-point port is identified by an interface ID. 7. A switch port that is link attached to a switch 
port on another switch is referred to as a cross-link 
switch port. A switch port that is link attached to an 
end-point port is referred to as an end-point switch 
port. 8. A dynamic switch node also has a switch 
internal port which shares many of the characteristics 
of an end-point port and allows communication between a 
dynamic switch node and an end-point node or another 
dynamic switch node. 9. An end-point address is assigned to each operational 
end-point port and switch internal port. 10. The major unit of transmission is a frame. 
A frame is transmitted by a source end-point port or 
switch internal port to a destination end-point port or 
switch internal port and contains the corresponding 
source and destination end-point addresses. 
In the ESCON I/O Interface architecture a frame is 
bounded by a start-of-frame (SOF) delimiter and an end-of-frame 
(EOF) delimiter. There are two types of SOF delimiters, the connect-SOF 
(CSOF) delimiter, which is used to initiate the establishment 
of a dynamic connection, and a passive-SOF 
(PSOF) delimiter, which has no effect on a dynamic connection, 
and two types of EOF delimiters, the 
passive-EOF (PEOF) delimiter, which has no effect on a 
dynamic connection, and a disconnect-EOF (DEOF) delimiter, 
which is used to remove a dynamic
