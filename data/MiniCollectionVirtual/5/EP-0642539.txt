<ABSTRACT>
Catalysts and processes are described to make low molecular weight, essentially terminally-unsaturated, viscous poly(1-olefin) or copoly(1-olefin) having a high terminal vinylidine content from a feed stock containing one or more 1-olefin and other volatile hydrocarbon liquids using a Ziegler catalyst made from a Group IVb metallocene and an aluminoxane cocatalyst, particularly bis(cyclopentadienyl) and bis(indenyl) titanium(IV), zirconium(IV) or hafnium(IV) compounds and methylaluminoxane. A particularly useful feed stock is a refinery stream containing 1-olefins and isobutylene which is used to make polyisobutylene. The reactive, essentially terminally-unsaturated, viscous poly(1-olefin) or copoly(1-olefin) can be functionalized to make a number of products useful as sealants, petroleum additives, adhesives, and the like by reacting the terminal vinylidine linkage with an aromatic, an epoxidation agent, a silylation agent, maleic anhydride, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, hydrogen, a halogen, a hydrohalogen, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the catalyzed preparation and
reactions of a reactive, low molecular weight, viscous, essentially-1-olefin-containing
poly(1-olefin) or copoly(1-olefin) prepared
employing a catalyst comprising a Periodic Group IVb metallocene
and an aluminoxane, and more particularly to the catalyzed
preparation and reactions of a reactive, low molecular weight,
viscous essentially-1-olefin-containing poly(1-olefin) or copoly(1-olefin)
prepared from a feed stock containing one or more C3 to C20
1-olefin and other volatile hydrocarbon liquids. The viscous
polymers of this invention are essentially terminally-unsaturated
poly(1-olefin)s or copoly(1-olefin)s with such terminal unsaturation
being more than 80% vinylidine type made by a catalyst system
using a Periodic Group IVb metallocene and an aluminoxane.A number of patents and other publications have described
the use of transition element, including those of Periodic Group IVb,
metallocene/aluminoxane catalysts (supported or unsupported) for
the polymerization of 1-olefins and certain cycloalkenes such as
ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, styrene,
cyclobutene, cyclopentene, and norbornene. The catalysts are said
to have advantages which include increased polymerization activity,
the ability to produce some terminal unsaturation and a narrow
molecular weight distribution in the product polymer, and the
ability to precisely choose polymer stereo regularity. See U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,530,914; 4,752,597; 4,808,561; and 5,001,244. See
also U.S. Patent No. 4,542,199 where polymerization of olefins of
formula CH2CHR in which R is H or C1 to C10 alkyl is described, the
Periodic Group IVb metallocene employed is a bis(cyclopentadienyl) 
transition element particularly zirconium, and copolymerization
with alpha-omega dienes is taught. In Example 4 of that patent,
bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride and aluminoxane are
used to give atactic polypropylene of molecular weight 5000.Typically, a high ratio of methylaluminoxane(MAO) cocatalyst
to metallocene must be used (approximately 300/1 or more). But
see U. S. Patent 4,808,561 wherein the reaction product of a mixture
of metallocene and aluminoxane in the presence of a support is said
to produce a catalyst which will polymerize olefins at an acceptable
rate without the presence of an objectional excess of aluminum.
Also, see U.S Patent No. 4,752,597 which describes the use of a solid
reaction product of a transition metal metallocene, particularly a
Group IVb metallocene, with
