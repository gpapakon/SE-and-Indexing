<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire has a concave reflector (1) built up from plane facets (4). 
The facets are arranged in rows (7) which extend between first parallel planes (8) 

towards the light emission window (3). The facets are also bounded by second parallel 
planes (9). The first and the second parallel planes extend parallel to the axis (2) of the 

reflector, but transversely to one another. Means (30) are present for holding an electric 
light source (31') in a plane transverse to the plane of symmetry (6) of the reflector. 

The luminaire is suitable for concentrating the light generated by the light source into a 
comparatively wide beam and for illuminating a field from a small distance with a high 

degree of homogeneity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a luminaire comprising:
a concave reflector having an optical axis, an optical centre on said axis, a
light emission window, and a reflecting surface which surrounds the optical axis, is
built up from plane facets, and has a plane of symmetry, which facets
are arranged in rows which each extend to the light emission window between
first planes, and in additionare bounded by second planes which are substantially parallel to one another
and transverse to the first planes;means for accommodating an electric light source inside the reflector in a
plane transverse to the plane of symmetry and in the optical centre.Such a luminaire is known from US 4,929,863.The known luminaire is rotationally symmetrical and suitable for forming
a narrow beam from the light generated by an electric lamp with a comparatively short
light source. The luminaire may thus be used for illuminating buildings with a height of
100 m or more, such as towers. The known luminaire may also be used for lighting
large areas, such as sports stadiums, in that luminaires are positioned along the
circumference. Because of the narrow beam, the luminaires do have to be placed on
comparatively high masts of, for example, 50 m or more.The plane facets in the known luminaire are arranged not only in rows
which extend to the light emission window while being bounded by first planes, but also
in continuous circumferential bands which are bounded by parallel second planes which
are perpendicular to the axis of the reflector.It is a limitation of the known luminaire that only a small portion of an
object positioned at a comparatively small distance from the luminaire can be
illuminated owing to the narrowness of the beam, and only with a very high local
illuminance, too high for many applications. It is an object of the invention to provide a luminaire of the kind
described in the opening paragraph which is compact and suitable for providing a
homogeneous and comparatively wide light beam.According to the invention, this object is achieved in that
the first planes are mutually substantially parallel and substantially parallel
to the plane of symmetry, andthe second planes are substantially parallel to the optical axis.The luminaire forms a comparatively wide homogeneous beam of the
order of 30 to 45° in directions transverse to the plane of symmetry, also called
"horizontal directions" hereinafter. This width is twice to three times as large as the
width in the plane of symmetry, also called "vertical direction" hereinafter.
