<ABSTRACT>
A benzothiadiazine derivative represented by general formula (I), a hydrate and acid addition salt thereof, and a remedy 
for peptic ulcer containing said derivative, said hydrate or said salt as an active ingredient. In formula (I) X represents methylene 

or a lower alkyl-substituted nitrogen atom; Y and Z represent each methylene or carbonyl; A represents phenylene which may be 
substituted by methoxycarbonyl; B represents lower alkylene or lower alkenylene; R₁ represents hydrogen, acetoxyacetyl, cyclohexylmethyl, 

or benzyl wherein the benzene ring may be substituted by lower alkoxy, halogen, nitro, lower alkyl, methylenedioxy 
or hydroxyl; R₂ represents lower alkyl or phenyl; and R₃ represents hydrogen, halogen or lower alkoxy, provided that 

the case where X, Y and Z represent each methylene, A represents unsubstituted phenylene, B represents lower alkylene, 
and R₁ represents hydrogen is excluded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzothiadiazine 
derivatives, hydrates thereof and acid addition 
salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention have 
activity to inhibit secretion of gastric acid and activity 
to protect the gastric mucosa and are useful for treating 
peptic ulcers. Ulcers occurring in the stomach or duodenum are 
caused primarily by hypersecretion of gastric acid. Some 
drugs are known for inhibiting the secretion of gastric 
acid by blocking the activity of the histamine H2 receptor; 
see, e.g., JP-A-59-116277 (EP-A-105 732) and JP-A-60-112781 
(EP-A-172 968). Several kinds of drugs of this class, such 
as cimetidine and famotidine, are commercially available. 
However, although these histamine H2 receptor antagonists 
exhibit high curing effects, they have the problem of being 
very likely to permit subsequent recurrence, so that it has 
been attempted to use such antagonists in combination with 
an anti-ulcer drug having activity to protect the gastric 
mucosa. Accordingly, drugs for treating peptic ulcers 
should preferably have activity to inhibit gastric acid 
secretion and activity to protect the gastric mucosa, and 
it is strongly desired to develop drugs having both of 
these activities.  
 We have conducted intensive research in view of the 
foregoing problem of the background art and consequently found 
that novel benzothiadiazine derivatives represented by the 
general formula () given below, hydrates thereof and acid 
addition salts thereof have excellent activities to suppress 
gastric acid secretion and to protect the gastric mucosa and 
are useful as medicinals. Thus, the present invention has been 
accomplished. More specifically, the present invention provides 
benzothiadiazine derivatives, hydrates thereof and acid 
addition salts thereof, the derivatives being represented by 
the general formula () 
 
wherein X is methylene or a nitrogen atom substituted with a 
lower C1-6 alkyl, Y and Z are each methylene or carbonyl, A is 
phenylene or phenylene substituted with methoxycarbonyl, B is 
lower C1-6 alkylene or lower C2-6 alkenylene, R1 is a hydrogen atom, 
acetoxyacetyl, cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl wherein the benzene 
ring may be substituted with lower C1-6 alkoxyl, halogen atom, 
nitro, lower C1-6 alkyl, methylenedioxy or hydroxyl, R2 is lower C1-6 
alkyl or phenyl, and R3 is a hydrogen atom, halogen atom or 
lower C1-6 alkoxyl with the exception of the case where X, Y and Z 
are each methylene, A is unsubstituted phenylene, B is lower C1-6 
alkylene
