<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of a polarisation insensitive 
wavelength multiplexing 2x2 tapered fused optical 

fibre coupler by progressive stretching the birefringence of the 
coupler resulting from the progressive stretching is subsequently 

nulled-out by elastic twisting of the coupler. The progressive 
stretching is performed under temperature conditions providing a 

profile in the coupling region of the coupler having the property that 
the coupling strength for one of the principal polarisation planes of 

the coupler remains substantially constant during said elastic 
twisting.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the provision of polarisation state 
insensitive wavelength multiplexing 2x2 tapered fused fibre 
couplers. It is known that mutual coupling between a pair of identical optical 
fibres can be achieved by arranging them in side-by-side contact, 
heating them to produce adhesion, and then stretching them, while 
hot, to produce localised plastic flow in order to provide a region of 
reduced cross-section where the evanescent fields of the two fibres 
are enlarged by an amount providing substantial overlap of those 
evanscent fields. This overlapping of the evanscent fields produces 
a mutual coupling of the two fibres, and thus there is produced a 
2x2 tapered fused fibre coupler. The strength of the coupling 
depends upon the amount of overlap, which is both mode 
dependent and wavelength dependent, and depends also upon the 
length and shape of the coupling region. If the two fibres are single 
mode fibres, the stretching may be controlled to produce a 
wavelength multiplexing 2x2 tapered fused fibre coupler having, in 
principle, the property that light of one specified wavelength, 
hereinafter referred to as the minimum power transfer wavelength, 
launched into one end of one of the fibres will emerge substantially 
exclusively from the other end of that same fibre, while light of 
another specified wavelength, hereinafter referred to as the 
maximum power transfer wavelength, launched into the same one  
 
end of the same one of the fibres will emerge substantially 
exclusively from the other end of the other fibre. In practice, 
because the coupling region of reduced cross-section does not 
possess circular symmetry, the coupling coefficient for light of any 
given wavelength that is plane polarised in the plane that contains 
the axes of the two fibre cores is not exactly the same as that for 
the same wavelength plane polarised in the perpendicular plane. In 
practice therefore the coupler exhibits birefringence whose principle 
planes are those two planes respectively in, and perpendicular to, 
the plane that contains the axes of the two fibre cores, and in 
consequence there are different minimum and maximum power 
transfer wavelengths for each of the two principle planes. A particular convenient way of making 2x2 tapered fused fibre 
couplers in a manner readily capable of producing regularly 
reproducible results is the progressive stretching method described 
in GB 2 150 703 B. This progressive stretching method uses a pair 
of clamps mounted on independent linear

A method of manufacturing a wavelength multiplexing 2x2 
tapered fused fibre coupler by progressive stretching, wherein the 

birefringence in the coupler resulting from the coupling produced by 
the progressive stretching is substantially nulled-out by elastic 

twisting of the progressively stretched coupling region, and 
characterised in that the progressive stretching is performed under 

temperature conditions providing the coupling region with a profile 
having the property that the coupling strength for one of the 

principle birefringence planes of polarisation of the coupling region 
remains substantially constant during said elastic twisting. 
A method of making a 2x2 tapered fused fibre wavelength 
multiplexing coupler for multiplexing first and second wavelengths, 

wherein a pair of single mode optical fibres (4, 5) arranged in side-by-side 
contact are heated in a zone where they are in contact, 

fused together and plastically stretched in a manner providing two 
tapers (63, 64)with an intervening region (65) of reduced, 

substantially constant, cross-section, along which intervening 
region the two fibres are mutually optically coupled, wherein the 

intervening region is elastically twisted substantially to null, at each 
of said first and second wavelengths, the difference between the 

coupling coefficients of the two principal states of polarisation 
(SOP's) defined by the coupler, and characterised in that the fusion 

of the two fibres is at a temperature providing said intervening 
region with a cross-sectional profile having the property that said 

elastic twisting leaves substantially unchanged the coupling 
coefficient at each of said first and second wavelengths of one of 

the principal SOP's of the coupler. 
A wavelength multiplexing 2x2 tapered fused fibre coupler in 
which polarisation sensitivity has been nulled-out by elastic twisting 

of the coupler, characterised in that said elastic twisting is 
unaccompanied by any significant change in the coupling strength 

for one of the principle planes of polarisation of the untwisted 
coupler.
