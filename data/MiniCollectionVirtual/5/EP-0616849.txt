<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine 
in which each of spacers (15) comprises a boss portion (21) fitted 

on a main shaft and a plurality of arm portions (22) extending 
from the boss portion in the radially outwardly and 

serving to induce bran removing air into a grain milling 
chamber through spaces between the circumferentially 

adjacent arm portions (22), is capable of discharging bran 
produced in the grain milling chamber with high bran 

discharging power and has little possibility that the 
bran removing power is reduced during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vertical
grain milling machine in which grains to be milled are
introduced into a grain milling chamber from vertical one
end of the grain milling chamber and grains having been
milled are discharged from the other end of the same, and
more particularly, to an abrasive type vertical grain
milling machine of the type that comprises an abrasive
roll assembly mounted on a main shaft extending straight
in the vertical direction and having a plurality of roll
elements fitted on the main shaft while being spaced by
means of a spacer from each other in the direction in
which the main shaft extends, and a porous or perforated
hollow cylindrical body extending vertically around the
roll assembly leaving a space therefrom so as to form a
cylindrical grain milling chamber around the roll
assembly in cooperation with the outer peripheral surface
of the roll assembly and having a large number of holes
or perforations through which bran produced in the grain
milling chamber is allowed to be released.It is noted that grain to be milled is not
limited to rice grain but may be other grain such as
wheat grain or coffee bean. Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication
No.49-89258 discloses an abrasive type grain milling or
polishing machine 204 in which, as shown in Figures 4 and
5, grains to be milled are introduced into a grain
milling chamber 201 from one end 202 of the grain milling
chamber 201 and grains having been milled are discharged
from the other end 203 of the same. In more detail,
Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No.49-89258
discloses the abrasive type grain milling machine 204 of
the type that comprises, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, an
abrasive type grain milling roll assembly 206 mounted on
a main shaft 205 and having a plurality of roll elements
208 fitted on the main shaft 205 while being spaced by
means of a spacer 207 from each other in the direction in
which the main shaft 205 extends, and a porous or
perforated hollow cylindrical body 210 extending in
parallel with the main shaft 205 around the roll assembly
206 leaving a space from the roll assembly 206 so as to
form the cylindrical grain milling chamber 201 around the
roll assembly 206 in cooperation with the outer
peripheral surface of the roll assembly 206 and having a
large number of holes or perforations 209 through which
bran produced in the grain milling chamber 201 is allowed
to be released.Incidentally, reference numeral 211 denotes a
hopper, 212 denotes a feed roll, 213 denotes an air 
blowe

<CLAIMS>
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine (1) comprising:

an abrasive type grain milling roll assembly (16) mounted on a main shaft (3)
extending straight in a vertical direction and having a plurality of roll elements (14)

fitted on said main shaft (3) while being spaced by means of a spacer (15) from
each other in a main shaft-extending direction in which said main shaft (3) extends;

and
a perforated cylindrical body (42) extending vertically around said roll
assembly (16) leaving a space therefrom so as to define a cylindrical grain milling

chamber (40) around said roll assembly (16) in cooperation with an outer peripheral
surface of said roll assembly (16) and having a large number of holes (41) through

which bran produced in said grain milling chamber (40) is allowed to be released,
grains to be milled being introduced into the grain milling chamber (40) from
vertical one end of the grain milling chamber and grain having been milled being

discharged from another vertical end of the same,
characterised in that

   each said spacer (15) comprises a boss portion (32) fitted on the main shaft
(3) and a plurality of arm portions (33) extending from said boss portion (32) radially

outwardly and serving to induce bran removing air into the grain milling chamber (40)
through spaces between the circumferentially adjacent arm portions (33).
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine
according to Claim 1, wherein a thickness of said arm 

portion in the main shaft-extending direction is equal to
a length of the boss portion in the main shaft-extending

direction.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine
according to Claim 1, wherein said arm portion comprises

a base portion extending substantially in the radial
direction and a tip end portion extending as turning

aside in the circumferential direction to be located on a
side opposite to a direction of rotation of the arm

portion as going toward radially outwardly.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine
according to Claim 3, wherein the tip end portion of said

arm portion is tapered.
An abrasive type vertical milling machine
according to Claim 1, wherein said cylindrical body

comprises a resistance member extending in parallel with
the main shaft and adapted to project into the grain

milling chamber in radial direction for serving to impart
resistance to movement of grains in the circumferential

direction of said roll assembly, and said resistance
member is formed with a circumferential groove in at

least one of heightwise portions thereof facing to the
spacers.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine
