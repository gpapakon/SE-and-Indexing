<ABSTRACT>
A rotor (1) for cutting machines has around its circumference receptacles (6) for supporting axially parallel beating arms (7), the beating arms (7) having an arm body (7a) of symmetrical cross-section and engaging in the rotor receptacles (6) by means of a mount projection (8). In order to achieve rational operation and a high level of crushing effectiveness without making construction complicated, the plane of symmetry (S) of the arm bodies is aligned approximately tangentially to the rotary movement of the rotor and extends in the region of the rotor receptacles (6) opening in the rotary direction of the rotors and projecting cutting edges (9) which extend symmetrically around the plane (S) of symmetry of the arm bodies in planes which are normal to the axis are moulded to the arm body.

A rotor for a crushing machine with peripheral
recesses (6), opening in the direction of rotation of

the rotor, for supporting beater arms (7) which are
parallel to the axis and have an arm member (7a) with a

plane of symmetry (S) aligned approximately at a
tangent to the direction of rotation of the rotor and

have a retaining attachment (8) which engages in the

rotor recesses (6), characterised in that projecting
cutting edges (9, 26, 31, 35) extending in planes at

right angles to the axis and symmetrically relatively
to the plane of symmetry (S) of the arm member are

integrally formed on the arm member (7a, 25a, 30a, 33a)
and have a recess (28) or are interrupted in the region

of the plane of symmetry (S).
A rotor according to claim 1, characterised in
that axially extending cutting edges (27, 36) are

provided on the arm member (25a, 33a) between the
cutting edges (26, 35) at right angles to the axis.
A rotor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the cutting edges (31) and/or the arm members

(30a) are equipped with chisel-like impact tips (32).
A rotor according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the outer ends of the cutting

edges (26) at right angles to the axis have a shape
(29) which slopes towards the arm member (25a).
A rotor according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the beater arms (7) in the rotor

recesses (6) are lockable by bars (10) parallel to the 
axis, and for the purpose of inserting the bars (10),

the retaining attachments (8) have longitudinal grooves
(11) and the recesses (6) form abutments (12) adapted

to the bars (10).
A rotor according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the beater arms (14) have

transverse retaining attachments (15) with a widening
head part (15a) and the rotor recesses (6) form

substantially radial receiving grooves (16) which are
undercut to match the retaining attachments (15).
A rotor according to claim 6, characterised in
that the retaining attachments (15) and the receiving

walls have grooves (18) or openings along the plane of
symmetry (S) for inserting a longitudinally extending

locking bar (17).
A rotor according to any of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the rotor recesses (6) are at

least partly made up of bracing plates (5a) inserted
axially between radial cheek parts (4).
A rotor according to claim 8, characterised in
that the rotor has a basically cylindrical shape with a

cross-section (E) flattened at two opposite side
regions.
