<ABSTRACT>
A mosaic target composed of a plurality of target pieces 
having solid-state bonded at their abutted interfaces. A 

first kind of target pieces of a first material and a second 
kind of target pieces of a second material are alternately 

arranged in a radial pattern or superposed in alternate layers 
and bonded at their abutted interfaces by solid-state 

bonding, such as HIP or hot pressing, and the solid-state 
bonded mosaic target blank is machined to a target which is 

bonded to a backing plate with the use of a solder. The 
solid-state bonding produces a mosaic target of a unitary 

construction, eliminating gaps among the target pieces 
without sacrificing the properties of the individual pieces. 

Abnormal discharge owing to gaps or contamination of the 
resulting film by concurrent sputtering of the solder or the 

backing plate is avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mosaic target composed of a
plurality of pieces, and more specifically to a mosaic target
in which the target pieces are solid-state bonded at the
abutted interface of the adjacent target pieces.Targets are usually disk or rectangular shaped plates,
which serve as sources of substances to be sputtered on
substrates to form thereon electrodes, gates, conductor
lines, elements, insulating films, protective films and the
like of various semiconductor devices. As accelerated ions
impinge on a target surface, the atoms constituting the
target are partly released by momentum exchange from the
target surface to the ambient space to deposit on an
oppositely located substrate. Typical sputtering targets in
use include the targets made of Al and Al alloys, refractory
metals and their alloys (W, Mo, Ti, Ta, Zr, Nb, etc. and
their alloys such as W-Ti), and metal silicides (MoSix, WSix,
NiSix etc.).Generally, targets of two or more different elements are
made by alloying or compounding those elements by melting or 
powder metallurgy. Where a target of good quality is not
obtained by these methods because of the density, composition,
oxygen concentration, or other problem, the adoption of a
mosaic target system is often an alternative. The mosaic
target system is realized, when a target is to be formed of
two or more elements, by working the materials of individual
elements or their alloys or compounds to suitable shapes and
appropriately combining and arranging them to form altogether
a disk or rectangular plate as a target of a desired
composition. The target thus combined and arranged is called
a mosaic target. In the mosaic target, the appropriately
shaped bulks or plates of each element or its alloy or
compound which constitute the structural units and are
arranged in abutted relation with adjacent unit(s) is called
as (target) pieces. For example, in a Ta-Mo mosaic target, Ta
pieces and Mo pieces are alternately combined and arranged in
a striped pattern or a radial pattern.Examples of mosaic targets, besides the Ta-Mo target, are
targets of alloys of refractory metals such as Ta-W, Ta-Ti
and W-Ti, and silicide targets.Conventional mosaic targets are fabricated by putting the
component pieces abutted together and bonding them in that
abutted state to a backing plate with the use of a solder,
namely a brazing metal such as In or the like or by shrink
fitting them directly on and into a backing plate. In either 
case, gaps of several to several hundred microns are formed
among the
