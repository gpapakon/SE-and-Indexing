<ABSTRACT>
A system of handrails (10A - 10S) extends throughout a building (12) with braille messages (18) imprinted on the inside (14) of the handrail to give identification, direction and warning to the user. The handrail also includes audio message means (20) operable by a message initiation means (22) that is operable by a visually impaired person.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to systems for aiding the
visually impaired and particularly to a handrail system
for guiding the visually impaired through a building.Concern about accessibility to buildings and other
structures by the physically impaired has increased in
recent years. Legislation and a new general sensitivity
has lead to modifications and additions to relieve the
burdens placed on the physically impaired.For example, most elevators now include braille
indicators on the control panel so that the visually
impaired can determine the location and function of
buttons on the panel. It is still true, however, that
the visually impaired obtain very little real assistance
in the way of signage in buildings. The new American
Disability Act requires that door signs for public
buildings include braille indicators. However, there are
no links between door signs and no readily available
indicators to the visually impaired where the door signs
are.Much more can be done, therefore, to assist the visually
impaired and it is the purpose of this invention to
provide such assistance.It is known from the prior art to provide a system for
guiding visually impaired persons in a building
comprising a series of consecutive handrails mounted in
the building and extending throughout the building and
braille message indicators imprinted on said handrails,
said braille message indicators indicating at least one
of:
a) location of the handrail;b) location of nearby departments, facilities,
offices and rooms;c) location of interruptions of the handrail, d) slopes, steps, wall openings, obstructions and
turns; ande) other information about the building.According to the present invention there is provided a
system in which at least one handrail further comprises
audio message means for audio description of locations in
the building and message initiation means operatively
connected to said audio message means for initiating a
message when actuated by a visually impaired person.The present invention provides a system for guiding
visually impaired persons through a building. The system
includes a series of consecutive handrails mounted within
building structures throughout the building. Braille
messages are imprinted on the side of the handrails with
each message to give identification, direction and
warning, such as (a) the location of the handrail, (b)
the location of nearby departments, facilities, offices
and rooms, (c) the location of interruptions of the
handrail, (d) slopes, steps, wall openings, obstructions
and

<CLAIMS>
A system for guiding visually impaired persons in a
building comprising a series of consecutive handrails

(10,30) mounted in the building (12) and extending
throughout the building (12) and braille message

indicators (18) imprinted on said handrails (10,30) said
braille message indicators (18) indicating at least one

of:

a) location of the handrail (10,30),
b) location of nearby departments, facilities,
offices and rooms,
c) location of interruptions of the handrail (10,30),
d) slopes, steps, wall openings, obstructions and
turns, and
e) other information about the building (12),
characterised in that
 at least one handrail further
comprises audio message means (20) for audio description

of locations in the building and message initiation means
(22) operatively connected to said audio message means

(20) for initiating a message when actuated by a visually
impaired person.
A system as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that
the braille message indicators (18) are imprinted on a

side of the handrail (10) where they may be read by the
tips of the fingers of someone whose hand is resting on

the handrail (10,30).
