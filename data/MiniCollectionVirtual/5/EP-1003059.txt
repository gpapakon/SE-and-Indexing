<ABSTRACT>
Single homogeneous planoconvex lens 10 having a uniform
refractive index is combined with single distributed-index lens

12 having its refractive index distributed in a radial direction
and the object plane, the homogeneous planoconvex lens, the

distributed-index lens and the image plane are arranged in that
order along the optical axis. Both surfaces of the

distributed-index lens are planar and the homogeneous planoconvex
lens has its convex surface directed toward the distributed-index

lens and the planar surface toward the object. Various
characteristics of the two lenses are so specified as to provide

an angle of view greater than 50°.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an objective lens to be
fitted at the distal end of an endoscope, more particularly, to
a wide-angle endoscopic objective lens that can provide a view
angle (a range in which an image can be focussed by the lens)
greater than 50°.Endoscopes are so constructed that a real image created with
an objective lens fitted at the distal end is transmitted through
image transmission optics to a position convenient for
observation. A suitable image transmission optics is selected
depending on use from among various types of fiber bundle and relay
optics consisting of an ordinary lens and a gradient index lens.From the viewpoint of use in connection with the endoscope,
the objective lens at the distal end of the endoscope is required
to be small in diameter and yet have an ability of forming an
in-focussed image over a wide view angle. An optics comprising
a plurality of spherical lenses is capable of providing a wide
visual field while effectively correcting various aberrations.
However, the use of a plurality of spherical lenses having an
outer diameter smaller than 1 mm results in extremely increased 
cost associated with difficulty in lens polishing, assembling and
adjusting operations.To overcome this problem, a rod lens having a gradient
refractive index in a radial direction is proposed as a low-cost,
small-diameter objective lens. The rod lens can be manufactured
easily and at low cost by ion-exchange and other techniques to
have a diameter not larger than 1 mm. Further, since the rod lens
is planar on both sides, the rod lens offers the advantage of great
simplicity in polishing both end faces, assembling into an
endoscope and achieving alignment of optical axes.The refractive index of a rod-shaped, gradient index lens
is expressed as
n (r)2 = no2•{1-(g•r)2+h4(g•r)4+h6(g•r)6+h8(g•r) 8+ ...}
where

has a great departure from the design value of gradient refractive
index, and thus cannot be substantively used as a lens. In some 
cases, the peripheral portion of the lens is made opaque in order
to prevent the stray light due to the reflection from the lateral
surfaces of the lens. Hence, the range of the gradient index lens
