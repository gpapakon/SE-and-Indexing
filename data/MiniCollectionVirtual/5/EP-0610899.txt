<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for
the formation of thick ceramic silicon oxide films that
are free of cracks and pinholes and that are also
insoluble in organic solvents.The formation of protective films on the
surface of substrates is widely used. In the
electric/electronic industries, recent increases in the
degree of integration and layer count of semiconductor
devices have resulted in a very substantial increase in
their complexity and in topographical variations on
their surface. For multi-layer circuits, an interlevel
dielectric layer may be formed on the surface of
semiconductor devices for purposes of planarization and
insulation between interconnections. Alternatively, a
passivation coating may be laid down on the surface of
a semiconductor device in order to planarize the
topographical variations on the semiconductor device
surface and to protect it from mechanical damage,
chemical damage, damage due to static, ionic
contaminants, nonionic contaminants, and/or radiation
damage.Silicon oxide films are typically used for
interlevel dielectric layers and passivation coatings.
Chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) and spin-coatings are
examples of methods used to form these silicon oxide
films. Spin-coating methods are exemplified by the use
of inorganic SOG (spin-on glass) and organic SOG.However, the silicon oxide films formed from
inorganic SOG suffer from cracking at film thicknesses
in excess of 0.3 micrometers. This has made it
necessary to carry out multiple applications in order
to level height differences of 1 micrometer or more.
Moreover, a particular problem with this technology is
that the film itself has a poor capacity to bring about 
planarization, thus requiring an etch-back
planarization step after film formation.By contrast, the silicon oxide films formed
from organic SOG are capable of forming crack-free
films in thicknesses of 1 micrometer and more by a
single application. However, as with inorganic SOG, the
organic SOG film itself has a poor planarization
capability, and this has also necessitated the
execution of an etch-back planarization step after film
formation. In addition, the silicon oxide films
obtained from organic SOG contain large quantities of
residual silanol and alkoxy groups and are therefore
highly hygroscopic. Moreover, due to the residual
alkoxy groups these films suffer from the problem of
carbon poisoning (carbon contamination) in the case of
oxygen plasma treatment. As a result of these
characteristics, these films have a poor electrical
reliability
