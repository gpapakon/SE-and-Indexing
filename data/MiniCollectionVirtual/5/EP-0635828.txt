<ABSTRACT>
A copy protected optical disc is recorded with digital 
data and a key information forming track turns of a 

predetermined pitch, in which the digital data are converted 
to a string of signal waveforms in a predetermined encoding 

scheme defined by the key information, the key information 
is recorded in a form of single frequency or FM carrier 

signal modulating the string of signal waveforms carrying 
the digital data in such a pit configuration that a width of 

the series of pits in a radial direction of the optical disc 
is deviated symmetrically with respect to a center of each 

track turn having a maximum width smaller than the predetermined 
pitch. And a recording apparatus for the disc comprises 

a converting device converting the digital data into a 
string of signal waveforms in a predetermined encoding 

scheme defined by the key information, a carrier generating 
device generating a carrier signal related to the key 

information, and a modulating device modulating a light beam 
with the digital data together with the carrier signal and 

record the data and the carrier signal as a series of pits 
on the disc, whereas a reproducing apparatus for the disc 

comprises detecting device detecting the recording codes and 
the key information recorded on the disc decoding device 

decoding digital data from the recording codes using the key 
information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disc and a recording and
reproducing apparatus, particularly, relates to an optical disc and a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for the optical disc having a copy-protection function.A description is given of the prior art referring in particular to Figures 1-4 of
the accompany drawings.In Fig. 1, a reference character 11 designates a first information pit row, 12 a
second information pit row, 13 a third information pit row, 11A a first information pit,
11B 
a second information pit, 11C a third information pit, L11A
a first information pit length, L11B a second information
pit length, L11C a third information pit length, P11AB an
interval between the first information pit 11A and the
second information bit 11B, P11BC an interval between the
second information pit 11B and the third information pit
11C, "WK" a width of each of the information pits 11A, 11B,
11C, "q" a pitch between neighboring information pit rows.In Fig. 2, a reference character 14 designates a
recording master disc, 15 a photo-resist, 16K the information
pit, and 17K a light intensity distribution curve of a
laser beam.In Fig. 3, a reference character 50 designates a
recording device, 51 an encoder, 52 a photomodulator, and
52a a laser beam carrying a series of recording codes.In Fig. 4, a reference character 55 designates a
reproducing device, 56 a CD (Compact Disc), 57 an optical
pickup, 58 a RF amplifier, and 59 a decoder.Next, a description is given of an outline of an optical
disc apparatus for the CD recorded with music as an example.First of all, an outline of a recording by using the
recording device 50 for the CD, i.e., an outline of a
master disc cutting, is described as follows:As shown in Fig. 3, sound signals are converted into a
predetermined digital data by an A/D converter (not shown)
and the digital data are inputted to the encoder 51. These
digital data are converted into a waveform string on the
basis of predetermined conversion rules by the encoder 51. 
This waveform string is inputted to the photomodulator 52.
This waveform string is amplified by the photomodulator 52,
and is converted into a series of recording codes for
driving a laser generator (not shown). The laser generator
generates a laser beam 52a carrying a series of recording
codes as an intensity modulated light beam in response to
the series of recording codes. The photo-resist 15 coated on
the recording master disc 14 is exposed to the laser beam
52a carrying the series of recording codes, so that
