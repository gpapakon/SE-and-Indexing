In US-4,246,429 there are described a number of benzeneacetamides and thioamides 
being useful as intermediates in the preparation of phytopharmaceutical compounds.

inhibit the replication of HIV and consequently may be useful for the treatment of 
individuals infected by HIV, in particular HIV-1. The present invention is concerned with compounds having the formula 
 
or

trifluoromethyl; methylcarbonyl or C3-6cycloalkyl; or a radical -C(=X)-NR16R17, wherein X is O or S, and 
R16 and R17 each independently are hydrogen or C1-4alkyl; or a radical -Alk-R18, wherein Alk is C1-4alkanediyl, and

can optionally be replaced with C1-4alkyl; or R6 and R7 taken together form a bivalent radical of formula -(CH2)m- wherein m is 3 or 
4 and wherein one or two hydrogen atoms can optionally be replaced with C1-4alkyl, in 
which case R5 represents hydrogen, C1-6alkyloxy, C1-6alkyl, halo, nitro,
