<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatic 
image developing toner containing a certain specific 
compound. In an image-forming process by means of an 
electrophotographic system, an electrostatic latent image 
is formed on an inorganic photoconductive material such 
as selenium, a selenium alloy, a cadmium sulfide or 
amorphous silicon, or on an organic photoconductive 
material employing a charge-generating material and a 
charge-transporting material, and the latent image is 
developed by a toner, then transferred and fixed on a 
paper sheet or plastic film to obtain a visible image. The photoconductive material may be positively 
electrifiable or negatively electrifiable depending upon 
its construction. When a printed portion is remained as 
an electrostatic latent image by exposure, development is 
conducted by means of an oppositely electrifiable toner. 
On the other hand, when a printed portion is destatisized 
for reversal development, development is conducted by  
 
means of an equally electrifiable toner. A toner is 
composed of a binder resin, a coloring agent and other 
additives. However, in order to impart desired 
tribocharge properties (such as desired charge up speed, 
tribocharge level and tribocharge level stability), 
stability with time and environmental stability, it is 
common to use a charge-control agent. The properties of 
the toner will be substantially affected by this charge-control 
agent. Further, in a case of a color toner, it is necessary 
to use a colorless charge-control agent or a charge-control 
agent with a pale color which does not affect the 
color of the toner. For negatively electrifiable toners, 
such pale-colored or colorless charge-control agents may, 
for example, be metal complex salt compounds of 
hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives disclosed in e.g. 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 42752/1980 and
