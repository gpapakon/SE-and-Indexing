<ABSTRACT>
A simplified manufacturing option for a pole core in the case of commutator motors having a laminated stator core (3) which is fitted with windings, is created in that at least one of the end discs (11) which bears the end surfaces of the laminated stator core (3) has connection housings (37, 39) into which the ends of the windings and electrical connecting wires are inserted. Contact is made easily between this pole core and the customer-specific plug housing (73), according to the invention, in that a bearing plate (19) consists of a prefabricated assembly structural unit with the customer-specific plug housing (73), carbon brushes (75, 77) and other structural elements and has plugs (79, 81) which are electrically connected to the plug housing (73) and can be inserted into the connection housings (37, 39) on the end disc (11), in order to make contact automatically, when the bearing plate (19) is fitted onto the pole core. Simple and fast through-switching of the motor is thus achieved on its completion.
