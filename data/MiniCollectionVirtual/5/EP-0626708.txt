<ABSTRACT>
A load break switch for medium-voltage switching installations has a contact arrangement consisting of a stationary contact (1) and a contact arm (2), which is mounted such that it can pivot, in an enclosure area which is filled with SF6. The contact arrangement (1, 2) is assigned an arc extinguishing chamber (6) having arc splitter plates (7). In order to achieve optimum switching behaviour in the area adjacent to the stationary contact (1), with a small space requirement, the arc splitter plates (7) run essentially parallel to that plane in which the contact arm (2) is located in the closed position (14) or in an intermediate position (8) during its pivoting movement (9), the free radial separation between the contact arm (2) and the arc splitter plates (7) being at its smallest after part of the pivoting movement (9).
