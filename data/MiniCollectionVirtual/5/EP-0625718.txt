<ABSTRACT>
A fibre optic ferrule (2) is provided with 
a fibre core (4) mounted within the axial centerline of 

the ferrule, and the end face of the fibre ferrule has a 
chamfered lead in edge (6). The ferrule (2) also has an 

end face (8) which is offset from the axial centerline by 
an angle (β). The chamfered lead-in edge (6) has edges (6a 

and 6b) proportionately angled such that the distance from 
the vertex of the polished end face to diametrically 

opposed edges of the convex surface are equal. Two such 
ferrules are in physical contact at the exact centerline 

of the fibre cores when the ferrules are disposed in an 
alignment sleeve (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the invention relates to an optical
fibre connector, and more particularly to the ferrule
which holds the optical fibre.Optical fibre connectors are typically comprised of
an optical fibre coaxially positioned in a ferrule, which is
then retained in an outer housing or sleeve. Generally,
a latching mechanism retains two fibers or a fibre and an
electronic component in electrical engagement. Typical
examples include a bayonet style ring, or a plastic outer
housing having a resilient latching system.The composition of a ferrule is typically chosen
depending on the application for which the fibre
connectors are used, and more particularly by the optical
quality of the system. For example, for a system
requiring high return loss, the ferrule is typically
comprised of ceramic or metal, but in other systems for
example in automotive sensors where a low return loss is
adequate, the ferrules, can be comprised of a plastic
molded ferrule. In any event, the optical quality of the
system is a function of the axial alignment of the fibre
ends as well as how well the fibre ends butt together.With reference to Figure 1, a well known prior art
system is shown schematically where two ferrules having a
chamfered leading edge is provided and where the end face
of the ferrule is flat, that is perpendicular to the axial
direction. The fibres would be located in an aperture
along the centerline of the ferrules such that when the
two ferrules butt together, the two fibre end faces are
also butted one against the other. In a system such as
that shown in Figure 1, where the ferrules are comprised
of a ceramic material, it is common to place the fibre
within the ferrule, adhesively fix the fibre within the
ferrule and grind the end face to provide a smooth 
polished surface. This provides the best butting
engagement between the end faces as well as provides a
highly polished fibre face to prevent light loss.With reference now to Figure 2, a later prior art
system is shown where two ferrules are shown having a
radiused end face, again where a fibre would be inserted
within an aperture of the ferrule, wherein the convex
surface at the end face provided precision abutment of the
two ferrules along the centerline of the ferrules. This
type of system prevents the two ferrules from butting
together at any other location than at the axial
centerline where the fibres are.With respect now to Figure 3, it is also known to
offset the end face of the ferrule by an angle α where
this angle is usually between 7-15°. The

A fiber optic ferrule (2,22,32) for receiving an
optical fiber (4) therein, the ferrule comprising a

cylindrical body terminated by a chamfered lead-in edge
portion (6) provided with a convex front face (8) which is

angularly offset by an acute angle β with respect to a plane
normal to the ferrule longitudinal axis, the ferrule being

intended to receive the optical fiber along its longitudinal
axis, the ferrule being characterised in that the chamfered

lead-in edge portion (6) is asymmetrically shaped, thereby
providing different lead-in angles (6a, 6b) at diametrically

opposed longitudinal sides thereof, and disposed such that
its intersection (7) with the cylindrical ferrule body is

also angularly offset with respect to a plane normal to the
ferrule longitudinal axis by substantially the same acute

angle β as that of the convex front face, said asymmetrical
lead-in edge portion (6) as well as said angularly offset

convex front face (8) being furthermore mutually arranged in
a manner such that the distance from the vertex (10, 30) of

the convex front face to a given point on the outer
perimeter of said convex front face is identical to that

from the vertex to a point diametrically opposed on said
outer perimeter, whilst said vertex (10, 30) is coincident

with the point of intersection of the ferrule longitudinal
axis with the convex front face.
The fiber optic ferrule according to claim 1,
characterised in that the convex front face is a partial

spheroid.
A fiber optic ferrule assembly comprising a ferrule

which an optical fiber is received, wherein the vertex of
the convex front face substantially coincides with the point

of intersection of the fiber axis with the convex front 
face.
The fiber optic ferrule assembly according to claim

optic connector (14).
A method of forming a fiber optic ferrule according
to any preceding claim characterised by the steps of:


asymmetrically chamfering a lead-in edge portion of a
cylindrical ferrule body such that the lead-in angle at

diametrically opposing longitudinal sides of the chamfered
lead-in edge portion (6) thus formed has different angular

values (6a, 6b) and the intersection of said chamfered
portion with the ferrule body is angularly offset by an

acute angle β with respect to a plane normal to the ferrule
longitudinal axis, and
subsequently polishing the end face (8) of the
chamfered lead-in edge portion (6) thus formed such that it

is made convex and also angularly offset with respect to a
plane normal to the ferrule longitudinal axis by

substantially the same acute angle β as that of the
intersection of the chamfered portion with the ferrule body,
wherein said asymmetrical lead-in edge portion (6) as
well as said angularly offset convex front face (8) are

furthermore mutually formed in a manner such that the

distance from the vertex (10, 30) of the convex front face
to a given point on the outer perimeter of said convex front

face is identical to that from the vertex to a point
diametrically opposed on said outer perimeter, whilst said

vertex (10, 30) is coincident with the point of intersection
of the ferule longitudinal axis with the convex front face.
