<ABSTRACT>
Prepn. for the enteral mourishment of onbological patients, comprising fats and opt. carbohydrates and/or proteins as well as the usual additives, is improved in that the fat comprises the following formulation and is either in the free state or compatible salt and/or ester (1) 30-35 (37-55) wt.% oleic acid; (2) 3-20 (5-15) wt.% linoleic acid, (3) 0.5-8 (0.8-5) wt.% alpha linolenic acid, (4) 1-10 (1.5-5) wt.% eicosapentanoic and docosahexanoic and (5) 0-0.6 (0-0.5) omega-3-aliphatic acid. Pref. ratio of omega-3-fatty acids to omega-6-fatty acids is 1:2.1-1:3 (1:2.3-1:2.7). The aliphatic acid is used (partly) as an oil. The oleic acid is used in the form of a vegetable oil contg. at least 75%, oleic acid. The linoleic acid is used an oil rich in linoleic acid (contact at least 70%). The content of alpha-linolenic acid is supplied by an oil contg. at least 45% alpha-linolenic acid. The eicoso-pentanoic and docosahexanoic used as fish oil contg. at least 30% omega-3-aliphatic acids. The formulation also contains medium chain length triglycenides in amt. of 10-20 wt.%. The formulation provides 40-65 (50)% energy, through the fats, 12-25 (18)% energy through the proteins and 20-45(32)% energy through the carbohydrates.
