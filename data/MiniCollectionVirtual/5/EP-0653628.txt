<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a sample stage of a scanning 
probe microscope head capable of changing the direction of a 

sample plane stably over a wide range in a simple operation. 
Fixtures 310 and 320 fix both ends of an outer flexible 

tube 220 of a flexible shaft 200. A displacement lead-in 
portion 400 displaces one end of an inner flexible tube 210 

of the flexible shaft 200 relative to the outer flexible 
tube 220, and a displacement lead-out portion 500 and a 

coupling portion 600 transmit the displacement led in the 

inner flexible tube 210 of the flexible shaft 200 to a 
sample carrier portion 700 to turn the sample carrier 

portion 700 about a turn axis, thereby getting a sample 
plane to change direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sample stage in 
the head of a scanning probe microscope, such as a scanning 
tunneling microscope (referred to as a STM hereinafter) or 
an atomic force microscope (referred to as an ATM 
hereinafter), and more particularly, to a sample stage 
capable of getting a sample plane to change direction by 
using a flexible shaft. STM head sample stages needed to coarsely focus on 
samples, heat sample planes and replace samples have been 
disclosed heretofore, for example, in the following 
literatures:

stages is illustrated in Fig. 28. This sample stage has a 
plurality of piezoelectric plates 52 supported by three legs 
51 and a sample carrier 53 mounted on one of the 
piezoelectric plates 52. The legs 51 are made to move like 
a looper by applying driving voltage to the piezoelectric 
plates 52, thereby getting a sample plane 53a to change 
direction. Fig. 29A illustrates another conventional sample 
stage. This sample stage is provided with a running arm 55 
pivotally mounted to a movable rod 56 by a connecting pin 
54, and a sample carrier 58 is formed at one end of the 
running arm 55. On the side of the other end of the running 
arm 55, a stopper 57 is fixed to the sample stage. In this 
sample stage, the direction of a sample plane 58a is changed 
by linearly moving the movable rod 56 upward together with 
the connecting pin 54 from the state shown in Fig. 29A and 
pivoting one end of the running arm 55, at which the sample 
carrier 58 is mounted, upward about the stopper 57 in 
contact with the other end of the running arm 55, as shown 
in Fig. 29B. However, the above-mentioned conventional sample 
stages have the following problems. Since the
