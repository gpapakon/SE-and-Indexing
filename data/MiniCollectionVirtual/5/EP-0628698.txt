<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing an elongated 
carrier (1) for a movable gate intended for closing a passage. 

The carrier 
functions to support railings (2) or the like closing means forming 

part of 
the gate as well as to connect said gate to a support anchored with 

respect 
to the ground, relative to which the gate is movable. The carrier is 

built 
up of two vertically spaced-apart beams (4,5) extending parallel to 

each other, 
whereby a stress is first set up in at least one of the beams (4,5), 

whereupon 
the stressed beam is fixedly connected to the other beam by means of 

plate-shaped parts (6,7) 
symmetrically positioned on either side of the beams (4,5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
movable gate intended for closing a passage, wherein an elongated carrier 
functions to support railings or the like closing means forming part of 
the gate as well as to connect said gate to a support anchored with respect 
to the ground, relative to which the gate is movable. 
From European Patent 
No. 0 128 248 a gate is known which is provided with a carrier, which is 
made up of a single beam, in which pretensioned wires are provided, by 
means of which a pressure load is applied to the beam in order to prevent 
vertically downward deflection of the beam. Generally this construction is satisfactory per se, but 
one drawback is inter alia the fact that tensioning of said wires usually 
has to take place on the site where the gate is to be placed, which 
involves extra cost and which furthermore implies the risk that the 
pretension is not optimally set up. Furthermore there is always the risk of breaking of the 
pre-tensioned wires. A further drawback is that an eccentric arrangement 
of the rollers will lead to a disadvantageous loading of the carrier. According to the invention a gate is manufactured in which the carrier is built up of two 
vertically spaced-apart beams extending substantially horizontal and 
parallel to each other, whereby a stress is first set up in at least one 
of the beams, whereupon the stressed beam is fixedly connected to the other 
beam by means of plate-shaped parts symmetrically positioned on either 
side of the beams, said plate-shaped parts being spaced-apart in horizontal 
direction, at least over part of their height, by a distance which is 
larger than the width of the beams, after which the stress of the stressed 
beam(s) is released.  
 When at least one of the beams is correctly stressed the 
carrier thus obtained will be slightly concave after the stress is 
released. Upon assembly of the gate it is then possible to arrange that 
the carrier is positioned in such a manner that the centre of curvature 
of the slightly concave carrier is located vertically above the carrier. 
If the carrier should slightly sag under the influence of the weight of 
the gate, the carrier will take up an at least substantially horizontal 
position, so that a light-weight an yet easily operated gate has been 
obtained. It is thereby possible to manufacture the carrier under optimal 
circumstances, for example in an air-conditioned room, so that the carrier 
is capable of optimally meeting the requirements made. Furthermore the
