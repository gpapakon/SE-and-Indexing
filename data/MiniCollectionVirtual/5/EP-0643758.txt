<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel end-functionalized
poly(vinyl ethers). More particularly, this invention
relates to novel poly(vinyl ether) amines and their use in
fuel compositions to prevent and control engine deposits.It is well known that automobile engines tend to form
deposits on the surface of engine components, such as
carburetor ports, throttle bodies, fuel injectors, intake
ports and intake valves, due to the oxidation and
polymerization of hydrocarbon fuel. These deposits, even
when present in relatively minor amounts, often cause
noticeable driveability problems, such as stalling and poor
acceleration. Moreover, engine deposits can significantly
increase an automobile's fuel consumption and production of
exhaust pollutants. Therefore, the development of effective
fuel detergents or "deposit control" additives to prevent or
control such deposits is of considerable importance and
numerous such materials are known in the art.Deposit control additives, however, differ in their
effectiveness for preventing or controlling deposits on
various engine components. This is believed to be due
primarily to the fact that each engine component has a
different operating temperature and some deposit control
additives are not sufficiently stable on the surface of
certain engine components to perform their intended 
function. In this regard, deposits on intake valves are
particularly difficult to control, since intake valve
operating temperatures can exceed 300°C. At such high
temperatures, many fuel additives are too volatile to be
effective, while others thermally decompose.Therefore, it would be particularly desirable to provide
effective deposit control additives which have improved
thermal stability at normal engine intake valve operating
temperatures and which further have a sufficient molecular
weight so as to be nonvolatile at such temperatures. The
present invention discloses a new class of poly(vinyl ether)
amine fuel additives having such properties.Polyether fuel additives are well known in the art. These
prior art additives, however, have a poly(oxyalkylene)
"backbone", i.e. the polyether portion of the molecule
consists of repeating oxyalkylene units, i.e.
[-CHR-CHR-O-]x. In contrast, the fuel additives of the
present invention have a vinyl ether polymer backbone
consisting of repeating vinyl ether units, i.e.
[-CHR-CR(OR)-]x.U.S. Patent No. 4,247,301, issued January 27, 1981 to L. R.
