<ABSTRACT>
A variable reluctance motor is driven by a circuit comprising a common switching element, and switching elements which 
correspond to the phases. The total value (total current i
t
) of the currents flowing through the phase coils is found. In accordance 
with the difference between the total value and a current command i
cmd
, and its sign (positive or negative), the duty ratio 
of the PWM signal for turning the common switching element on and off is calculated. Further, based on which phase is 

excited according to the electrical angle of the rotor, and on the sign of the difference, the turn on/off of the switching element 
corresponding to each phase is controlled. In this way, a current loop is controlled to permit the detected total current 

i
t
 to follow up the current command i
cmd
. Therefore, even when the excited phases are switched over, the current is always 
controlled to suppress the torque ripple.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driver circuit 
and a driving method for a variable-reluctance motor (VR 
motor). More specifically, the invention relates to a 
driver circuit and a driving method, in which drive 
control is effected by means of a circuit for motor 
current control including switching devices one more in 
number than the phases of the motor. A VR motor is a motor in which excitation current 
is supplied to exciting coils of a stator so that 
salient-pole teeth of the stator are excited, a salient-pole 
tooth of a rotor is attracted by means of a 
magnetic force of attraction generated in the salient-pole 
teeth of the stator, and the rotor is rotated by 
means of the resulting rotatory force. This motor is 
provided with switching devices for supplying excitation 
current to the exciting coils for individual phases, and 
the switching devices are opened and closed in response 
to the rotational angle of the motor, whereby the 
exciting coils for the individual phases are excited to 
rotate the rotor. In the case of a three-phase VR motor with A-, B- and 
C-phases, for example, an A-phase switching device 
is closed to connect an A-phase exciting coil and a DC 
power source, thereby starting to supply current. When 
an A-phase salient-pole tooth attracts the salient-pole 
tooth of the rotor so that the rotor rotates through a 
predetermined angle, the A-phase switching device is  
 
opened to suspend current supplying. Then, a B-phase 
switching device is closed to excite a B-phase exciting 
coil. The motor is rotated in one direction by 
successively exciting the A-, B-, and C-phase coils in 
like manner, thereafter. In reversing the motor, the 
motor can be reversed by exciting the A-, C-, and B-phase 
coils in the order named. In controlling the current flowing through each 
exciting coil of this VR motor according to the pulse-width 
modulation system (PWM system), driver circuits 
must be formed independently for the individual phases. 
Therefore, each phase requires four switching devices or 
a combination of two switching devices and two diodes. 
Thus, a driver circuit of the conventional VR motor 
requires use of a number of switching devices and 
diodes, so that the driver circuit itself is increased 
so much in cost, and requires two cables for each phase. 
Accordingly, the driver circuit becomes more expensive, 
and its wiring entails more man-hours. An arrangement improved in this point has been 
applied for a patent in Japan (Jpn. Pat. Appln. No. 4-84966).
