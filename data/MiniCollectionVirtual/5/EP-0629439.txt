<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sulphidated catalyst containing platinum on activated charcoal. The activity of the catalyst can be considerably improved, with the selectivity remaining the same, if an oxidising agent is added to the platinum-containing impregnating solution.

<CLAIMS>
A sulphidised catalyst which contains platinum on 
activated carbon, with a platinum content of 0.1 to 

5.0 wt.% and a sulphur content of 0.1 to 2 moles per 
mole of platinum, obtainable by mixing an aqueous 

solution of a platinum compound with an aqueous 
suspension of activated carbon, heating the mixture to 

a temperature between 70 and 100°C, precipitating the 
platinum compound with a base and reducing the 

sparingly soluble platinum compound with a reducing 
agent at the same constant temperature, filtering off 

and washing the catalyst obtained in this way, 
treating with a sulphidising agent and washing again,
 
characterised in that the aqueous solution of platinum 

compound contains an oxidising agent and that the 
activated carbon has an average particle diameter of 

10 to 40 µm, a specific surface area greater than 
500 m
2
/g, a total pore volume greater than 0.5 ml/g, a 
residual ash content of less than 5 wt.% and a pH 

higher than 5. 
A process for preparing a sulphidised catalyst which 
contains platinum on activated carbon according to 

Claim 1 by mixing an aqueous solution of a platinum 
compound with an aqueous suspension of activated 

carbon, heating this mixture to a temperature between 
70 and 100°C, precipitating the platinum compound with 

a base and reducing the sparingly soluble platinum 
compound with a reducing agent at the same constant 

temperature, filtering off and washing the product 
obtained in this way, treating with a sulphidising 

agent and washing again, characterised in that the 
aqueous solution of platinum compound contains an 

oxidising agent and that the activated carbon has an 
average particle diameter of 10 to 40 µm, a specific 

surface area greater than 500 m
2
/g, a total pore volume 
greater than 0.5 ml/g, a residual ash content of less 

than 5 wt.% and a pH higher than 5.  
 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
hydrogen peroxide in an amount of 0.1 to 10.0 moles, 

preferably 0.5 to 5.0 moles per mole of platinum is 
used as oxidising agent.
