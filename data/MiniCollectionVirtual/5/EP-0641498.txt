<ABSTRACT>
Electric machines are used to produce electrical energy or are driven by electrical energy. Such machines include a stator assembly (60) and a rotor assembly (36) rotationally positioned within the stator assembly (60). A gap (62) is formed between the rotating element and the stationary element. To increase the life and efficiency of many electric machines, heat formed within the gap (62) is carried away by passing a cooling media through the gap (62). The present electric machine (12) includes a cooling system (32) wherein the electric machine (12) is positioned in an inlet plenum (16) of a gas turbine engine (10). Compressed air from the gas turbine engine (10) is used to cool the gap (62) of the electric machine (12). An expansion turbine (80) is attached to the rotor assembly (36) upstream of the gap (62) and has high pressure gap cooling air directed through the expansion turbine (80) into the gap (62) to cool the electric machine (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cooling 
of an electric machine and more particularly to the 
cooling of a rotating element and a stationary element 
within the electric machine. Generators are a type of electric machines 
used to produce electrical energy. Generator 
operation is based on the principle of electrical 
induction, whereby a periodic flow of electricity is 
produced in a loop-type conductor as a result of the 
periodic variation of the flux of the magnetic lines 
of force passing through the loop. To do this, either 
the loop is caused to rotate in a constant magnetic 
field or, alternatively, the magnetic field can be 
rotated. Thus, a gap is formed between the rotating 
element and the stationary element. Many generators 
cool the rotating and stationary elements by passing 
air through the gap between these components to 
increase life and efficiency of the generator. Many 
generators utilize air cooling in which a fan or pump 
is used to accelerate the air entering the gap. The 
use of fans and pumps add work to the air, increases 
the temperature of the air prior to entering the gap 
and hence, reduce the efficiency of the generator. 
Furthermore, overall efficiency will be lower because 
work will be required to run the fan or pump. Several schemes have been used to cool 
generators and motors. For example, in U.S. -A- 
3,558,942 
a motor is disclosed having an  
 
improved cooling means. The compressed air, from an 
external air compressor, is forced through 
circumferentially arrayed passages within the rotor 
whenever cooling is required. Another cooling scheme is disclosed in U.S. 
-A- 4,427,908. 
An electric machine has air under pressure 
which is circulated in a closed circuit. After the 
air is heated by the thermal losses of the electrical 
machine, the air is cooled in a heat exchanger and 
directed back into the machine. Another cooling scheme is disclosed in U.S. 
-A- 4,611,137. 
A machine is disclosed having a 
stator and a rotor forming an air gap. Grooves are 
provided to collect coolant under the influence of 
centrifugal force and a pilot pump collects coolant 
from the associated groove to convey the same to a 
pressure pump. The solutions to the cooling problem, as 
mentioned above, complicate the structure, increase 
cost and complicate the system design used to cool 
generators and motors while attempting to increase 
efficiency. The present invention is directed to 
overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth 
above.
