<ABSTRACT>
In a continuous process for continuous casting 
and hot-rolling of metal sheet, off-line storage of a 

slab (17) takes place in a thermally insulated storage 
chamber (13) located alongside a thermally insulated 

zone (3) through which the slab lengths travel in the 
production line between cutting means (2) for the slab 

and the hot-rolling mill train (4). On stoppage of the 
hot-rolling mill train, at least one slab length is 

transferred laterally to the off-line thermally 
insulated storage chamber. To improve ductility, an 

induction heating stage (20) is combined with a 
subsequent temperature-maintaining stage in the furnace 

(3) for homogenization of temperature within the slab. 
Both these stages are performed on the slab at its 

casting thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus
for continuous casting and hot-rolling of metal to
produce metal strip, using a continuous production
line. The invention is primarily applicable to steel
production, though not restricted thereto, and will be
described below mainly in relation to steel.The continuous operation of a continuous
casting and hot-rolling facility can save energy and
labor to a great extent as compared with conventional
separate factories for steelworks and rolling-mill.
Such continuously operated facilities have been
increasing in number in recent years.Merits of the continuous operation include
decrease of energy consumption, since a slab
temperature decrease is made as little as possible to
minimize re-heating, and labor saving as no transport
of the slab from the steelworks to the rolling-mill is
needed.To make continuous the operations of the
continuous casting process and the hot-rolling process,
it is desired that the combined facility should be
optimized in total with respect to the material to be
produced, amount of production, method of obtaining a 
raw material, facility cost, running cost, energy
consumption, and manufacturing and labor costs.Methods of making continuous the operations of
the continuous casting process and the hot-rolling
process can be roughly classified into two: a method of
rolling a slab a few times with use of roughers before
the slab is fed into a finishing rolling mill train
which it passes once to roll to a desired production
thickness; and a method of feeding a slab into a
finishing rolling mill train without rougher, to pass
through the mill train only once to roll to a desired
production thickness.However, if the slab is too thick, there are
limits on these methods. There can be no realistic
facility that can feed a slab, for example of 200 mm
thickness into the finishing rolling mill train to pass
through the mill train once to roll, for example to 1.6
mm thickness because of requirements for keeping the
rolling temperature high and increasing the rolling
speed. Thus, it is necessary to install the roughers.On the other hand, if the slab is thin, the
roughers can be omitted, which can lower the facility
cost and the production cost. As an example, JP-A-63-132703
discloses a method of making continuous the
operations of the continuous casting process for
casting the thin slab and the hot-rolling process 
without rougher. This document proposes a compact
facility of casting a relatively thin slab for a
medium-scale production of around a
