<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to easily retrieve a desired file in a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus 
used as an external storage of a computer, for example. Recording tracks are obliquely formed on a magnetic tape, 

and data of a file is recorded on the recording tracks. Management data is recorded on the first part of the magnetic 
tape, and search patterns corresponding to the management data are recorded on the recording tracks extending in the 

longitudinal direction of the magnetic tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording 
and/or reproducing apparatus, and is suitable to, for 
example, an external storage of computers etc.. Heretofore, in this type of magnetic recording 
and/or reproducing apparatus, the ID-1 format data 
recorder has been provided (ANSI x3.175-1990 19mm Type 
ID-1 Recorded Instrumentation), in which recording 
tracks are helically and sequentially formed on a 
magnetic tape to record and reproduce desired data with 
high density. That is, in such a data recorder, as shown in Fig. 
11, a magnetic tape 1 is wrapped around a rotary drum 
rotating at a predetermined speed. The magnetic tape 1 
is run at a predetermined speed, so that recording 
tracks TRs (TR1, TR2, TR3, TR4, TR1, TR2, ...) are 
helically and sequentially formed by a magnetic head  
 
mounted on the above rotary drum. Thus, desired data is 
recorded to the recording track TR1. Further, at this time, the data recorder forms 
recording tracks TA, CTL, and TC extended to the 
longitudinal direction at the upper and lower ends of 
the magnetic tape 1, and records the track set ID of 
the recording track TR to the recording track CTL. The track set ID is an absolute position 
information recorded from the beginning of the magnetic 
tape 1, and is recorded between predetermined 
synchronizing signals in the period of 4 tracks with 
respect to the recording track TR. The recording tracks TA and TC can record 
management data of the user etc., therefore, the data 
recorded in high density to the recording track TR can 
be searched easily, by reproducing the recording tracks 
TA, CTL, and TC. Further in the data recorder, when a data is 
recorded to the recording track TR, the data is 
recorded having a parity code of product code added for 
error detecting and correcting, in order to record 
and/or reproduce the desired data reliably. That is, as shown in Fig. 12, after the data 
recorder takes in the data DATA at a predetermined unit  
 
(= 36,108 [Byte]), it divides the data DATA into 306 
blocks, and adds an error detecting and correcting code 
of the Reed-Solomon (i.e. being C2 code) to each block. Furthermore, the data recorder divides the block 
into the first and the second field FIELD0 and FIELD1, 
and then adds an error detecting and correcting code of 
the Reed-Solomon (i.e. being C1 code) so as to 
orthogonalize with the C2 code in each of the fields 
FIELD0 and FIELD1. Thereby, in the data recorder, the reproducing 
data is error-corrected by using the C1 and C2 codes in 
reproducing, in
