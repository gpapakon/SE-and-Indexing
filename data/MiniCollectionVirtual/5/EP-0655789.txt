<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a method for producing high-temperature 
superconducting Josephson devices using a 

chemical etching solution of phosphorous acid and sulfuric 
acid to form substrate steps, exclusive of ion milling and 

sputtering process, thereby easily producing the devices 
and making large area of the substrate etched. 
It comprised the step of forming a mask on a 
predetermined portion of a substrate; and immersing the 

substrate having the mask in a mixed acid in which the 
volume ratio of phosphoric acid to sulfuric acid is on the 

order of approximately 10 or more, so as to form a step at 
the boundary between the masked region and the unmasked 

region; thereby making the surface of the substrate smooth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to methods of producing
high-temperature superconducting Josephson devices and, more
particularly, to methods of producing step-edge type high-temperature
superconducting Josephson devices using a chemical etching solution of
phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid to form substrate steps, without the
use of ion milling and sputtering processes, thereby easily producing the
devices and making a large area of etched substrate.Ever since a high-temperature superconductor was found various
types of superconducting Josephson devices have been produced.
However, high-temperature superconductor manufacturers have
significant difficulty in producing good quality junction devices because
their crystallisation temperature is higher and their coherence length is
shorter than metal-based superconductors, and because there is crystal
anisotropy. To avoid this difficulty, a bridge type Josephson junction
using a crystallographic grain boundary of a YBCO (YBaCuOy) thin film
has been studied, but since it is virtually impossible to control the
junction location, size and quality due to the properties of the material,
this technique is not advantageous.Recently, all over the world, many attempts have been made to
artificially manufacture weak link devices. There are three principal 
techniques: the step-edge process of forming the steps in a substrate to
control the location at which a crystallographic grain boundary is formed,
the bi-crystal process of making the crystal orientation is somewhat
different, and the bi-epitaxial process of utilising a buffer layer to rotate
the crystal orientation at an angle of 45°.Among the junctions described above, it is known that the step-edge
junction is more easily manufactured compared to the other
junctions and therefore is being actively researched. This type of
junction is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in this figure, sharp steps are
formed on a usual substrate in such a way that the steps are angled by
45° or more relative to the surface of the substrate, followed by growth
of an epitaxial YBCO thin film on the steps, so as to produce a
crystallographic grain boundary at each of the step-edge portions.At present, most researchers mainly use an ion-milling process or a
sputtering process for the manufacture of the step-edge junction in a
substrate. The disadvantages of these techniques are that the apparatus
used is expensive; and mass production and reproducibility are not readily
attained. Accordingly, these are obstacles preventing the
