<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copolymers derived from
p-dioxanone, and especially to crystalline copolymers
having mechanical and biological properties which are
desirable for the preparation of absorbable surgical
sutures and devices.U.S. Patent 4,052,988 describes p-dioxanone
homopolymers and the preparation of absorbable filaments
exhibiting mechanical and biological properties suitable
for use as surgical sutures. Unlike previous absorbable
synthetic sutures, for example sutures derived from
homopolymers or copolymers of lactide or glycolide,
p-dioxanone sutures are particularly well suited for use
as monofilament sutures. Monofilament sutures made with
p-dioxanone have enhanced flexibility and pliability
compared to conventional absorbable synthetics sutures.
Conventional absorbable synthetic sutures generally have
a braided or twisted construction in a multifilament
form to reduce the "stiff" feel of the suture.
Unfortunately, multifilament sutures are often
disadvantageous because their rough surface can often
tear tissue during surgical procedures.As good as the sutures derived from p-dioxanone
are, there is still room for improvement. U.S. Patent 
4,643,191 describes copolymers of p-dioxanone and
lactide, and absorbable sutures prepared therefrom. The
lactide component of the copolymer may offer enhanced
physical properties, for example, increased straight or
knot tensile strength and reduced modulus, without
sacrificing any of the other outstanding properties of a
p-dioxanone homopolymer.U.S. Patent 4,653,497 describes absorbable sutures
prepared from copolymers of p-dioxanone and glycolide.
The glycolide component of the copolymer significantly
increases the rate of invivo absorption and the invivo
breaking strength retention properties of the copolymer,
properties which can be extremely advantageous for
certain surgical procedures.A recent European Patent Application, EPA 460,428
A2, also describes copolymers of caprolactone, glycolide
and lactide. This application describes a block
copolymer formed by a two-stage polymerization process.
In the first stage of this process a prepolymer is
formed with a high content of a caprolactone type
monomer such as p-dioxanone, the remainder of the
prepolymer being a fast reacting glycolide type monomer.
In the second stage of the polymerization the prepolymer
is reacted with an additional fast reacting glycolide
type monomer to provide a segmented block copolymer European Patent Application EP-A-440448 describes a
crystalline copolyester of p-dioxanone and
