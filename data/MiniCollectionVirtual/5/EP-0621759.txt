<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a dishwashing machine (1) of a considerably shorter design than currently used continuous-throughput machines. In order to reduce significantly the water, power and washing-agent consumption, the dishes are washed in the various dish-holding racks (3, 19, 20) in a fixed operating cycle, the rinsing-device (5, 6) circuits being brought into operation only during their particular sector of the washing programme.

Dishwasher for washing dishes commercially

with a dish treatment chamber (2) which comprises a washing zone (5) and
a post-rinsing zone (7),
with a transport device (10, 11) for transporting the dishes running
longitudinally through the treatment chamber (2)
with a program control device which controls the transport and the cleaning
process of the dishes so that


the transport of the dishes (4) occurs in rapid traverse through an input
opening (2) to the washing zone (5) immediately following the input

opening (2), in which the transport device (10, 11) is switched off to
stop the dishes (4),
the washing process of the dishes (4) is started and ended controlled by
the program with a plurality of washing jets (6, 6') and stationary dishes

(4),
after ending the washing process the program-controlled transport
device conveys the dishes into the post-rinsing zone (7) immediately

following the washing zone (5), in which the post rinsing process is
performed with a plurality of post-rinsing jets (8, 8') with a switched off

washing device and with a slow movement of the transport device
compared to the rapid traverse until the exit of the dishes from the

dish treatment chamber.
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that between the washing
process in the washing zone (5) and the subsequent post-rinsing process in

the post-rinsing zone (7) there is a short draining phase (
t = t
3
 - t
2
).
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that a thermally insulated
collecting tank (29) for holding the washing liquid in the dishwasher is

provided.
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that different washing and/or
post-rinsing intervals with relatively graduated temperatures are provided, and 

in that for the washing and/or the post-rinsing liquids of different temperatures
different collecting tanks (34, 35) are provided.
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that an end switch (21)
preferably activated by the dish holder (3) is provided in the region of the

washing zone (5), the signal of which switches off the transport device (10, 11)
as soon as the dishes (4) in the washing zone (5) are in washing position.
Dishwasher according to claim 1 or 5, characterised in that the transport
device (10, 11) comprises two conveyor belts (10, 11) or conveying chains or

the like arranged on either side of the rinsing chamber (2).
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that the washing zone (5)
corresponds in length to at least the length of a dish holder (3).
Dishwasher according to claim 1 or 7, characterised in that the post-rinsing
zone (7) for the post-rinsing process in the draining region of the rinsing

chamber (2) corresponds in length to almost half the length of the washing
zone (5).
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that the washing (6, 6')
and/or the rinsing jets (8, 8') swing the water back and forth, and in particular

are designed to be pivotable.
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that the drive for the dish
holder (3) during the washing process and/or the post-rinsing process is

designed to swing back and forth or oscillate.
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that the input and/or the
output openings for inserting or removing a dish holder (19, 3, 20) are closed

respectively by means of a loose hanging, flexible, preferably double curtain
(28, 27). 
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that during the insertion of
the dish holder (3) into the washing zone (5) of the rinsing chamber (2) the

washing process is begun and the dish holder (3) stands in the washing zone
(5), and in that the post-rinsing process in the post-rinsing zone (7)

immediately following the washing zone (5) is performed during the further
transport of the dishes (4) on the transport device (10, 11), whereby the dishes

(4) also stand for a time in the post-rinsing zone (7).
Dishwasher according to claim 1, characterised in that the transport device
(10, 11) after the removal of the dishes (4) continues to run for a prespecified

period in order to receive new dishes into the rinsing chamber (2).
Dishwasher according to claim 13, characterised in that after the removal of
the cleaned dishes (4) where no new dish holder (19) has been inserted after a

specific period the transport device (10, 12) is stopped.
Dishwasher according to claim 13, characterised in that the insertion of a new
dish holder (19) into the rinsing chamber (2) is performed during the removal of

the treated dish holder (3, 20).
