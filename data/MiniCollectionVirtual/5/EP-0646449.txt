<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved apparatus 
for forming injection molded plastic articles having an 

inner wall portion. The apparatus includes a mold cavity 
portion (112) and a mold core portion (118) defining a 

cavity space (124) in the shape of the plastic article to be 
formed. The apparatus further includes at least two hot 

runner nozzles (132,132',132'') for injecting molten plastic 
material into the cavity space. The nozzles are preferably 

offset to outer portions of the mold core portion so as to 
provide an increased space (A') in the mold core portion in 

which cooling conduits (142), inlets and the like can be 
placed to increase the cooling capability of the mold core 

portion. The offsetting of the nozzles also provides the 
mold core portion with increased strength. Each of the 

nozzles communicates with an inner wall portion of the 
cavity space via a hook-shaped passageway (138,138',138'') 

and an inside gate (134,134',134''). Additionally, each of 
the nozzles has a metal portion (152,152',152'') for 

maintaining plastic material in the hook-shaped passageway 
in molten condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection molding 
apparatus according to the first part of claim 1 and in 
particular, to an improved nozzle arrangement which permits the 
mold core to have an increased cooling capability and increased 
strength and which allows the fabrication of smaller diameter 
plastic articles without dangerously sharp edges. Injection molding systems for forming plastic articles 
typically use hot runner nozzle arrangements to inject molten 
plastic material into a cavity space. In one type of hot runner 
nozzle arrangement, a heating element is placed near a center 
gate or an edge gate through which molten plastic material flows 
into the cavity space. This type of nozzle arrangement helps 
maintain the plastic material in the desired molten condition. 
US-A-4,768,945 exemplifies such a nozzle Arrangement. As shown 
therein, the nozzle arrangement may include an inclined nose 
portion for housing a heating element for maintaining the plastic 
material in a molten condition and a hook-shaped passageway for 
supplying the molten plastic material to an edge gate. Some molded plastic articles, such as cups and buckets, have 
molded lip or rim portions forming a top surface on the article. 
one of the more serious problems associated with the molding of 
these articles is the formation of unwanted  
 
sharp edges along the top surface and/or the outer edge of the 
lip or rim portion. This problem has been addressed by using a 
rim gating technique wherein molten plastic material is first 
injected into the inside edge of the rim defining portion of the 
cavity space and then permitted to flow down along the sidewall 
defining portions of the cavity space. This technique not only 
addresses the problem of sharp edges but also addresses other 
undesirable molding problems such as core shifting. US-A-5,145,630 
(EP-A-440 841), illustrates this type of rim gating 
technique. While successfully dealing with the core shifting and the 
edge problems, the system according to US-A-5,145,630 is limited 
in the size of the articles which it can mold. In particular, it 
cannot be used to mold articles having an effective diameter 
below 150 mm. This is in part due to the fact that smaller 
diameter articles require the mold core to have an increased 
cooling capability. In the design, the cooling capability of the 
mold core is limited by the nozzle arrangement. For example, as 
shown in Fig. 1 herein, which is Fig. 8 in the US-A-5,145,630, 
there exists a dimension A between the hot runner
