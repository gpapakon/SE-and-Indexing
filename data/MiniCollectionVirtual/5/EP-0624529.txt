<ABSTRACT>
An underground storage vessel (1) having a domed support (2) and a domed lid (3) which can be mounted thereon and through which armatures are passed in a sealed manner, such as a filling line (6), a plunger pipe (7), a gas displacement connection/water tap (8) and a threshold-value transmitter connection (9), is provided with a residue collection vessel (10) which surrounds the armatures in a fluid-tight manner, is designed as a rigid trough and is supported on the domed lid (3) by means of a vertically adjustable supporting device (14). The supporting device (14) consists of a plurality of supporting sleeves (21) with an internal thread, to which a supporting rod (2) is assigned in each case, which supporting rod can be screwed into the corresponding supporting sleeve (21) by means of an external thread.

Underground storage container (1) including 

(a) a dome connection (2) and a dome lid (3), which is 
mountable thereon and through which fittings, such as a 

filling line (6), a gauge rod tube (7), a gas 
compensation connection/water spigot (8) and a threshold 

value sensor connection (9) pass in a sealed manner, and 
including 
(b) a residual amount collecting tank (10), which 
surrounds the fittings in a liquid-tight manner and 

comprises a rigid tank and which is supported on the dome 
lid (3) by means of a support device (14) comprising 

feet,
 
characterised in that 
(c) the brickwork dome shaft (4) has a reinforced 
concrete rim, which is covered by a shaft cover (5) which 

may be driven on; 
(d) the residual amount collecting tank (10) has a 
cylindrical side wall and a water-tight, two-part cover 

with an inner lid (11a) and an outer cover (11); 
(e) the residual amount collecting tank (10) is 
connected via a return flow line to the dome lid (3) of 

the storage container (1); 
(f) the feet of the residual amount collecting tank (10) 
comprise at least three tubular sleeves (21), screwed 

into which is a respective externally threaded support 
rod (22), resting on which is a support ring (23), whilst 

a support plate (24) is secured to the lower end of each 
support sleeve (21) and a mounting plate (25) is secured 

to the upper end of each support rod (22); 
(g) a cable of the threshold value sensor connection (9) 
passes through the side wall of the residual amount 

collecting tank (10) in a liquid-tight manner;  
 
(h) the liquid-tight bushing for each tube (6;7;8) 
comprises a respective hole (6) in the base of the 

residual amount collecting tank (10), through which a 
respective one of the tubes (6;7;8) passes, a sleeve (17) 

being sealingly fastened around the hole, around which 
the lower end of a mineral oil-resistant sealing member 

(18) is positioned, the upper and lower end of which is 
sealingly pressed at the outer surface of the tube in 

question against the sleeve (17) by clamping collars 
(19;20).
