<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for supporting a ballastless-track railway rail (R), including a block (B) of concrete held by its lower part in a shoe (1) made of elastically deformable material immobilised in a bed of mortar (M). According to the invention, the upper edge of the shoe (1) is provided with a collar (2) including a peripheral lip seal (21) intended to seal the connection between the shoe (1) and the bed of mortar (M).

A rail support device (R) for ballastless track, the device
comprising a concrete block (B) having its bottom portion held in a sock (1)

of elastically deformable material which is itself held in a bed of mortar (M),
with the top margin of the sock being provided with a collar (2) including a

peripheral sealing lip (21) designed to ensure that the bond between the
sock (1) and the bed of mortar (M) is watertight,

   characterised in that said collar (2) is implemented in the form of
an add-on piece including means (20) for snap-fastening it to the sock.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that said snap-fastening
means comprise a substantially semicylindrical peripheral rib (20)

designed to be forced into a corresponding groove (10) formed in the top
margin of the outside side face of the sock (1).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the top portion of said sock (2) includes a peripheral

bead (22) designed to come into bearing contact against the side face of
said concrete block (B).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said collar (2) includes an internal peripheral duct (23)

or an outside groove (230) or a clamping element (3).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said collar (2) is shaped as a closed loop and

possesses longitudinal elasticity in the circumferential direction.
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said sealing lip (21) is pivotable about an axis parallel

to the longitudinal axis of the collar (2) with a snap action on passing from a
high position to a low position in which its free end comes into bearing

contact against the bed of mortar (M).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said collar (2) is of a color that is different from the

color of the sock.
A device according to claims 2 and 4, characterised in that
said peripheral duct (23) is formed in said rib (20). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said collar (2) includes a shoulder (24) for overlying the

top edge of the sock (1).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the collar (2) is made of an elastomer material.
An elastically deformable collar designed to be fixed to the
top margin of the sock (1) for protecting a block (B) for rail support (R) held

in the bed of mortar (M) for ballastless track, characterised in that it
comprises snap-fastening means (20) on said sock (1) and at least one

peripheral sealing lip (21) for the purpose of ensuring watertightness
between the sock (1) ) and the bed of mortar (M) .
A collar according to claim 11, characterised in that it further
includes a shoulder (24) for overlying the top edge of the sock (1).
A collar according to claim 11 or 12, characterised in that it
further includes, in its top portion, a peripheral bead (22) designed to come

into bearing contact against the side face of the block (B) for the purpose of
ensuring watertightness between said block (B) and said sock (1).
A collar according to one of claims 11 to 13, characterised in
that the snap-fastening members consist of a peripheral rib (20) designed

to be forced into a corresponding groove (10) formed on said sock (1) or
vice versa.
A collar according to one of claims 11 to 14, characterised in
that it further comprises an integrated clamping element (3).
A collar according to claims 14 and 15, characterised in that
the clamping element (3) is integrated in an internal duct (23) formed inside

the rib (20) or housed in an outside groove (230).
A method of manufacturing a rail support (R) for ballastless
track comprising placing a block (B) of concrete in a sock (1) of elastically

deformable material and then casting a bed of mortar to hold the bottom
portion of said sock, characterised in that a collar (2) is fixed by snap-fastening

means to the top margin of the sock (1) prior to casting the
mortar, the collar including a peripheral sealing lip (21) for the purpose of

ensuring watertightness between the sock (1) and the mortar (M).
A method according to claim 17, characterised in that the
free end of said lip (21) is embedded in the bed of mortar (M). 
A method according to claim 17, characterised in that the
mortar is cast in such a manner that the free end of said lip (21) bears

against the top face of the bed of mortar (M) after it has set.
