<DESCRIPTION>
Pressure sensitive adhesives, which are normally tacky materials adherent 
upon application of light pressure, are desirable in a number of industrial 
applications because they are applicable to many substrates and are easily 
adapted to production line techniques. In order to function satisfactorily as 
a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), a composition must provide a balance of 
properties including good tack, adhesive strength and cohesive strength. The 
pressure sensitive adhesive must adhere instantaneously when applied to 
substrates of differing surface characteristics. Further, for many industrial 
applications, the bond obtained by the use of the adhesive must have sufficient 
strength to remain firm over relatively long periods and under different and 
sometimes severe environmental conditions. We have now found that the cohesive properties of the adhesive will be 
maintained, even at elevated temperatures, without significant decrease in peel 
adhesion, by the incorporation in the pressure sensitive adhesive polymer of 6 
to 20% by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated N-substituted amides or esters 
of the general formula: 
where R₁ is H or CH₃; with the proviso that (a) when X is NH and R₂ is H, R₃ is 
or O-R₅ ;
 
 
(b) when X is NH and R₂ is OH; R₃ is 
and
 
(c) when X is O, R₂ is H and R₃ is 
where in (a), (b) and (c), R₄ is C₁-C₄ alkyl or (CH₂)n and n is 2-4 and R₅ is H or 
C₁-C₄ alkyl. Preferably, hydroxyl-containing monomers may also be employed as to impart 
functionality that is coreactive with the acetal or acetal/hydroxyl groups of the 
above monomers. Typical hydroxyl-containing comonomers are hydroxypropyl 
(meth)acrylate and hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate. The monomers described herein may be used to improve the cohesive strength 
of virtually any pressure sensitive adhesive system containing ethylenically 
unsaturated functionality. Thus, the monomers may be interpolymerized into any 
conventional vinyl ester, acrylic or mixed vinyl ester acrylic polymer provided 
the polymer has a Tg in the range of -5°C to 60°C, preferably in the range of 
-40°C to 60°C in order to maintain adequate pressure sensitive properties. Suitable pressure sensitive adhesive polymers for use herein include vinyl 
(C₃ to C₁₀) ester polymers, as well as polymers of vinyl acetate with alkyl esters 
of acrylic or methacrylic acid wherein said alkyl groups contain from 1 to 18 
carbon atoms; copolymers of vinylidene chloride with alkyl esters of acrylic or 
methacrylic acid wherein said alkyl groups contain
