<ABSTRACT>
A telephone adjunct, or a telephone which incorporates the telephone 
adjunct, includes a smartcard reader (10) which provides users with enhanced 

capabilities. One basic concept disclosed is the ability of smartcards to interact with 
a service provider called by the user. A salient feature of the invention is that the 

user can interact with the service provider in the normal mode (e.g., through voice 
communication) and, at will, switch over to digital communication between the 

smartcard and the service provider. Normal mode operation can be reinstated upon 
termination of the digital communication by the smartcard. In one embodiment, the 

adjunct contains the smartcard reader (10) coupled to a modem and the modem is 
coupled to a network port (25) of the adjunct through a switch (22). The user's 

telephone is coupled to the network port of the adjunct through the same switch. 
This switch is under influence of a controller (23) that is sensitive to selected control 

signals, such as voice energy from the user's telephone, voice or carrier frequency 
from the network and carrier or data signals from the modem.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to smartcards and, more particularly, to smartcard 
readers in a communication environment. A smartcard is a card that contains a microprocessor, memory, 
input/output capability and a power system. Typical smartcards are credit-card sized 
and are compatible with the ISO credit card standards. Smartcards come in different varieties but, primarily, they are 
distinguished by whether or not they contain accessible electrical contacts. However, 
regardless of whether the smartcard has contacts or is contactless, current art requires 
the use of smartcard readers. A smartcard reader contains apparatus and circuitry for 
supplying power to the circuitry within the smartcard and circuitry for 
communicating digital information to, and from, the smartcard. Typically, smartcard readers are physically connected to, and intimately 
associated with, a service providing apparatus. One example is a computer. A user 
seeking access to the computer has the user's smartcard read by the smartcard reader 
and information derived from the smartcard is analyzed. The analysis is basically a 
security check. When the computer determines that the user is authorized, access is 
granted to the computer's resources. This is an illustration of smartcard use where 
the smartcard provides an identification. Another application of smartcards is to provide a value, such as a dollar 
amount. The card is read by a smartcard reader that is coupled to a computing 
means in association with a service-providing device; and with each use the dollar 
amount associated with the card is decremented. This is akin to the magnetic mass 
transit ticket found, for example, in the Washington, D.C., subway system. A 
similar use is found in Europe where the smartcard reader is associated with a 
telephone, the value that is stored in the smartcard is "time" and the telephone 
apparatus includes means for measuring call durations and decrementing the amount 
of "time" left on the smartcard. In none of the prior art applications is there a card reader that includes 
means for interacting with both a telephone and remote apparatus that is accessed via 
the telephone network.  Substantial benefits are attained for users of the telecommunications 
network through a telephone adjunct, or a telephone which incorporates the 
telephone adjunct, that includes a smartcard reader. One basic concept incorporated 
in this invention is the ability of smartcards to interact with a service provider called 
by the user. One salient feature of
