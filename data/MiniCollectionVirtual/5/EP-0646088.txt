<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging container for a 
detergent system. Liquid detergent compositions are well known and widely used 
for the washing of fabrics particularly in washing machines. 
It is however well known that a bleach component cannot be 
successfully incorporated in an aqueous based composition 
because of reactions which take place during distribution and 
storage of the detergent. It has therefore been proposed to 
distribute the bleach component separate from the other 
component of the system, the bleach component being combined 
with the other component by the user prior to the washing 
process. The bleach component can be in any solid form such 
as particles, granules, flakes or the like but is most 
conveniently in tablet form having a size corresponding to 
the required dose for a single wash process. US Patent Specification No. 2250666 discloses the use of a 
bottle for liquids corresponding to the preamble of appended claim 1, 
having a combined label/capsule container 
mounted on the neck of the bottle. Capsules from the label 
are added to the bottle before use. According to the present invention there is provided a 
packaging container suitable for containing a liquid and a 
solid component as defined in claim 1, comprising 
a bottle for containing the liquid 
component, a plinth on which the bottle can stand, having an 
upper surface to receive the bottle and a tray for solid 
component, being located in the plinth and slidably removable 
therefrom. There is thus provided a single packaging unit which can 
contain both the liquid and solid components of the detergent 
system which greatly facilitates the storage, transport and  
 
distribution of the detergent system. Moreover it provides 
the user with a convenient storage of the system between uses 
and ensures that the two components do not become separated 
and mislaid. The tray can be provided with a plurality of recesses,  
 
each of the recesses conveniently being adapted to contain 
one or more tablets of the solid component. The plinth can be formed integrally with the 
bottle but is conveniently snappingly engaged with the base 
of the bottle. This enables the bottle to be distributed 
and sold without the plinth so that the user is not 
provided with a plinth with each and every purchase. The 
tray can also be provided with a foil layer removably 
sealed to the tray to close the recesses therein. This not 
only retains the solid component in the tray during 
distribution of the packaging container but also
