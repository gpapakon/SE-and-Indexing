<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a loom control system 
operable to stop the loom in the presence of a yarn break足

age. This loom comprises a feeding device 1 having a yarn 
storage drum 2 for temporarily storing the yarn and a yarn 

store sensor 6-9, 20, 30 sensing the quantity of yarn stored 
on the drum of the feeding device for transmitting an elec足

tric sensor signal representing the quantity of yarn stored 
on the drum to the feeding device to control the operation of 

the feeding device and to thereby control the quantity of 
yarn stored on the drum. 
Prior art loom control systems required complicated, 
costly and unreliable sensors for detecting whether a yarn 

breakage has occured or not. 
The present invention improves this state of art by pro足
viding a loom control system of the above-mentioned kind 

with a monitor means being electrically connected to the 
yarn store sensor for receiving the sensor signal, wherein 

said monitor means derives information on yarn breakage 
before and/or after the feeding device from said sensor sig足

nal or its variation with respect to the time to generate a 
stop signal for the loom.
