<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the method of producing 
deep fried comestibles which have up to a 40% 
reduced fat content as compared to conventionally 
prepared deep fried comestibles. Along with a lower fat 
content, the deep fried comestibles are delicious and 
have an appetizing texture. Particularly, the invention 
relates to deep fried potato goods. More specifically 
the invention relates to a novel coating material 
comprising calcium and ungelatinized amylose which is 
applied to potato products before frying to reduce the 
amount of fat which is absorbed by the potato. The 
invention also relates to the improved fried product 
resulting from practicing the method. Deep fried foods such as french fries and potato 
chips are quick, appetizing foods. However, deep fried 
foods have been losing popularity due to the fitness 
craze and the average consumer's heightened awareness of 
the fat content of food they ingest. The average french 
fry having a 7,1 x 7,1 mm (9/32" x 9/32") cross section contains about 
14-18% fat by weight which causes most fat-conscious 
consumers to avoid french fries altogether. When foods are formulated to be low-fat, the low-fat 
product generally suffers in texture and flavor. The aim 
of this invention is to produce a reduced fat french 
fry which does not suffer the deleterious effects 
generally associated with low-fat foodstuffs. U.S. Patent 3,397,993 discloses a conventional 
process for preparing french fries. The process of the 
'993 patent is diagrammed in Figure 1. First the 
potatoes are washed, peeled and cut into elongated 
strips. The strips are then washed to remove the free 
starch remaining on the surface. Next the potato strips 
are blanched in steam (about 2 to 10 minutes at about 93-100°C 
(200°F to 212°F)) or water (71-93°C (160°F to 200°F) for 3 to 8 
minutes) until they turn to a generally translucent  
 
condition throughout. The strips are then dehydrated to 
effect a weight loss of from 20-30% by blowing 66-177°C (150° to 
350°F) air on the strips for 5 to 20 minutes. Following 
dehydration, the strips are partially deep fat fried 
(parfried) for from about 15-60 seconds at a temperature 
of about 149-190,5°C (300°F to about 375°F). After the partial fry, 
the strips are frozen down to -18°C (about 0°F.) When the frozen 
product is prepared by the final user, it is finish 
fried in a suitable oil for about 1.5 to 3 minutes at 
about 149-190,5°C (300-375°F). A common practice in the art is to dip the blanched 
strips into a 0.5 to 0.75% sodium acid
