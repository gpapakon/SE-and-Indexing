<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a seal (2) between a lining pipe or liner (1) and a surrounding pipe (3), said seal being exteriorly arranged on the liner. The seal (2) includes a cavity (14), the outer wall (16) of it being expandable into engagement against the inner surface (4) of the outer pipe (3) by injecting a filler medium (16) into the seal. The latter has a lip (18) inside its cavity (14), this lip covering a hole (19) for filling medium into the cavity, said lip (18) serving as a non-return valve. The outer wall (16) of the cavity (14) has a fold (17) and the cavity is formed with its defining surfaces substantially in contact for eliminating the presence of air in the cavity before the injection of filler medium. At one end the seal (2) has a conical lip (10) provided with a waist (11), and at its other end it has a cylindrical lip (21), the end surface (12) of the conical lip (10) being intended for making contact with the inner surface (4) of the outer pipe (3), and the cylindrical lip (21) is intended to serve as a non-return valve for optional filling of filler medium in a region behind the seal. The invention also relates to a method of achieving the inventive seal (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Seal between a Liner Pipe and a Surrounding Exterior PipeThe present invention relates to a seal according to the preamble to claim 1, and a method of providing it.Lining pipelines, so-called "relining", is a rapid and economical method of repairing such as leaking sewage or water pipes inthe ground.An attractive relining method is to use relatively short lining tubes or liners, which have a length such that they can be taken down into an access chamber, for being connected together there, e.g. for insertion into a leaking sewage pipe which is to be repaired. In such a case, the ends of the liner are implemented such that the mentioned connection is enabled. The liners are usually made from a plastics material, but other materials are also conceivable, of course.When the mentioned relining method is used, there are problems with achieving an effective seal between liner and surrounding pipe at the ends of a liner pipeline. This seal must be effective, so that the liquid which is to flow in the liner pipeline does not flow outside it and to a point of leakage.In addition, the seal must be made so that liquid flow is disturbed to the least possible extent on entry inτo and exit from the liner pipeline.The seal shall also prevent such as extraneous ground or leakage water from undesirably ccming into the liner.The object of the present invention is thus to provide an extremely effective seal that solves the above-mentioned problems, and this ob¬ ject is achieved by the seal having been given the characterizing fea¬ tures disclosed in the claims. Tne inventive seal can thus be used, e.g. at the ends of a connected-together string of liners, i.e. the free ends of the end liners in a string of liners are provided with the inventive seal. The latter is so effective that there are no problems in stopping off the liner where a service pipe connects to the outer pipe, a very 

effective seal being made with the aid of the inventive seal on either side of the service pipe connection, resulting in that it is not neces¬ sary to excavate down to the service pipeconnection and renew it, or with the aid of some complicated type of remote operation take up, and arrange a new connection between the service pipe and the liner.__he inventive seal is very advantageous, since it allows injecting fil¬ ler material into the seal when the liner provided with the seal is in place in the outer pipe, the seal effectively guiding the filler mater- ial so that it flows round the entire circumference of the liner and thus

CLAIMS
1. A seal between a lining pipe or liner (1) and surrounding outer pipe (3), said seal (2) being exteriorly arranged on the liner and con¬ taining a cavity (14) of which an exterior part (16) is expandable into engagement against the inner surface (4) of the outer pipe (3) by in- jecting a filler medium, charactei-lzed in that the seal (2) inside its cavity (14) has a lip (18) which covers a hole (19) to the cavity, this hole being intended for injecting the filler medium.
2. Seal! as claimed in claim 1, c___aracter___ed in that the exterior part (16) of the cavity (14) has a fold (17) and in that the cavity is substantially formed with its adjacent surfaces against each other be¬ fore filling injection medium (60), for eliminating the presence of air in the cavity (14).
3. Seal as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the seal has a conically shaped lip (10) at one end, and in that the conical lip is provided with a waist (11).
4. Seal as claimed in any one of claims 1-3, c±iaracterized in that the seal has a cylindrical lip (21) at one end.
5. Seal as claimed in any one of claims 1-4, c±_aracter__zed in that the filling hole (19) of the seal is elongate in the transverse direc¬ tion of the seal.
6. 
'
 Seal as claimed in any one of claims 1-5, characterized in that the surface of the seal engaging against the liner (1) has at least one ridge (23) for ensuring axial location of the seal relative the liner.
7. Method of providing a seal between liner (1) and surrounding outer pipe (3), said seal (2) being intended for arranging exteriorly on the liner, said seal having a cavity (14) of which an outer part (16) is expandable into engagement against the inner surface (4) of the outer pipe (3) with the aid of filler medium injection, said seal (2) having a lip (18) inside its cavity (14), this lip covering a hole (19) to the cavity for entry of the filler medium, characterized in that the 


seal (2) is manufactured by rolling out on a sleeve or mandrel a plural¬ ity of layer's under tension of the material from which the seal is to be manufactured, and in that a releasing agent is inserted between the lip (18) and walls (15, 16) of the cavity (14) which engage against this lip.
8. Method as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that the releasing agent is a terrperature resistant foil.
