 BIOPSY NEEDLE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to biopsy needles for extracting human tissue specimens. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTNone of the prior art is adapted for end cutting, side cutting and extracting of tissue specimens, the procedure being performed without the need for suction or irrigation and in such a manner that the struc¬ tural integrity of the specimen is uniquely preserved. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The biopsy needle hereof includes a rotating and axially removable inner cannula housed within an outer cannula in the form of a penetrating needle, the configuration allowing for the removal of multi¬ ple tissue specimens with a single needle insertion, with a minimized risk of trauma to surrounding tissue, the distal ends of the outer and inner cannulas containing coextensive open channels, the outer cannula having an operative distal piercing end defined by converging lateral piercing edges interconnected inferiorly by a semiconical trans¬ verse base surface, and superiorly by a trailing semicircumferential cutting edge, angled forwardly with reference to the needle horizontal axis.The inner cannula has an identical coaxial operative distal end which may be telescoped into the distal end of the outer cannula, the inner cannula also containing converging lateral cutting edges, connected inferiorly by a semiconical trans¬ verse base surface, the superior surface containing a semicircumferential edge which is angled rearward- ly with reference to the needle horizontal axis. The inner cannula has an operative 180° rotary motion around the common longitudinal axis of the inner and outer cannulas, said rotary action per- 

forming the transverse cutting of tissue entrapped within the open distal specimen chamber of the needle, the procedure being performed without the need for suction or irrigation, in such a manner that the structural integrity of the specimen is uniquely preserved.Both inner and outer cannulas have proximal hand-held ends provided with engaging knobs, for the control of the operation of the assembled device.
