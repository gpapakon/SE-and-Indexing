<ABSTRACT>
Improved control member for valves comprising a valve body (112) formed by a 
base (114), provided with an inlet duct (116) terminating in a bevelled rim (154) 

acting as a sealing seat in the form of a lateral surface of a truncated cone, 
emerging in a shallow seat (148), and with an outlet duct (118) connected to the 

shallow seat (148) into which the sealing seat (154) comes out, and by a cover (120) 
facing the base (114) and gripping between its internal cavity (122) and the shallow 

seat (148) a mobile closing member (132) comprising a solid central plug (136) 
engageable with the sealing seat (154), a flexible thinner radial zone (142) connecting 

the central plug (136) to a raised peripheral zone (140) which can be gripped, with 
the interposition of elastic means (152), between the internal cavity (122) of the 

cover (120) and the shallow seat (148) of the base (114). The mobile member (132) 
may be operated either manually by a handle such as those typical of a tap or by a 

motor-driven actuator such as a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder, making it also 
possible to achieve a control means of the proportional kind.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved control system with mobile members 
for valves which can be used in particular both for interrupting and controlling the 
flow of steam utilizable in manually operated taps as well as in valves operated 
automatically by means of known actuators of the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic 
or pneumatic kind which avoids phenomena of wear and/or breakage of membranes 
forming part of said mobile members and allows both simple opening and closing of 
served devices and proportional control of the flows through said devices. For some time now valves for interrupting and, where necessary, controlling the flow 
of industrial fluids, such as compressed air, operating liquids and steam, have been 
known. A very common kind of such valve is the so-called membrane valve 
containing as a mobile member a membrane of flexible and elastic material which, 
under the thrust of a member connected to external actuators, interferes with one or 
more apertures of inlet and outlet ducts emerging in a valve seat, resulting in an 
interruption of the fluid passing through said valve. The material of the membrane must be an elastomeric material compatible with the 
controlled fluid and in the case where the fluid is high-pressure and 
high-temperature saturated or superheated steam, it is necessary to use as the 
membrane material a silicone elastomer resistant to high temperature. However, often 
this silicone elastomer, even though it is suitably resistant to the temperatures of the 
steam, may undergo variations in the presence of saturated steam on account of 
water in the liquid state which may penetrate into the membrane body, causing 
swelling and disintegration of the latter over the course of time, requiring periodic 
replacement thereof and, what is worse, releasing particles of elastomer into the 
environment of the said steam, the presence of which cannot be tolerated in certain 
applications, such as for example autoclaves for the sterilization of medicinal and 
food products. In order to overcome this serious drawback, it has been thought to 
line the face of the silicone-elastomer membrane exposed to the steam with a 
relatively thin layer of material resistant to high temperatures and inert with respect 
to the steam, such as for example polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Unfortunately this 
solution has provided only a partial remedy because, owing to the fact that PTFE 
has physical properties very different from those of silicone elastomers and the 
silicone elastomer

<CLAIMS>
Control member for valves made entirely of hard and elastic plastic material, 
characterized in that it has at least one thicker zone (136) which acts as an plug and 

a thinner zone (142) which, by flexing, allows movements of the plug (136) outside 
of and in engagement with a rim (154) or seat supporting said plug (136). 
Control member for valves, according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
control member (132) is in the form of a disc with a substantially cylindrical central 

thicker portion (136) with bevelled rims connected to a thinner radial zone (142), 
which is able to flex easily in a substantially axial direction, in turn connected to a 

circular peripheral zone (140) with a thickness greater than that of the radial zone 
(142) designed to engage with fixed parts of a valve body (112). 
Control member for valves, according to Claim 2, characterized 
   in that the cylindrical-shaped central thicker portion (136) terminates in an external 

surface shaped in the manner of a flattened dome which matches the shape of a 
bevelled rim (154) present between an inlet duct (116) and a shallow valve seat (148) 

present in the body (112) of the said valve. 
Control member for valves, according to Claim 3, characterized in that another 
thicker portion (138) designed to engage with a thrust member (126) of actuating 

means (130) for the said valve is located in the said disc-shaped control member 
(132) exactly above the thicker portion (136) which acts as a plug. 
Control member for valves, according to Claim 4, characterized in that the said 
control member (132) is provided in its thicker peripheral portion (140) with a 

circumferential recess (150) designed to accommodate an elastic member (152) to be 
gripped between the control member (132) and the valve body (112). 
Control member for valves, according to the preceding claims, specially suited 
for steam valves, characterized in that said control member (132) consists of a disc 

of PTFE which is obtained as one piece, by lathe working, from a cylindrical bar 
of PTFE. 
Control member for valves, according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
body (112) of the valve is divided into two parts, a lower base (114) and an upper 

cover (120), the lower base having an inlet duct (116) and an outlet duct (118) for 
said valve and the shallow seat (148) provided with a first step (146) for 

accommodating the thicker peripheral zone (140) of the disc-shaped control member 
(132) and with two apertures (156, 158) communicating with the two inlet and outlet 

ducts (116 and 118) and the upper cover (120) being provided with an internal 
 

recess (122) for engaging, on the opposite side, with the thicker peripheral zone 
(140) of said control member, where said internal recess (122) is extended by a 

through-hole (124) for allowing the movement of said thrust member (126). 
Control member for valves, according to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
shallow seat (148) of the base (114) with its first step (140) and the bevelled rim 

(154) of the inlet aperture (156) are lathe machined so as to obtain a smooth and 
careful finish.
