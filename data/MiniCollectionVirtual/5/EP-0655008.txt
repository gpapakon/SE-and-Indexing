<ABSTRACT>
The treatment device comprises an approximately semi-spherical source-collimator assembly (2) having a large number of gamma ray sources (21) associated with channels (20) directed to the same focal point (18). Each gamma ray source (21) is associated with a group (17) of channels (20) arranged in the manner of a cone (19), the apex of which is at the focal point (18).

<CLAIMS>
Device for the treatment of cerebral lesions 
using gamma radiation, including a sources-collimator 

assembly (2) approximately hemispherical in shape 
containing a large number of gamma ray sources (21) 

associated with channels (20) which are all orientated 
towards the same focusing point (18), characterized in 

that each gamma ray source (21) is associated with a beam 
(17) of channels (20) set in a conical revolution 

envelope (19) the apex of which is situated at the 
focusing point (18). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that each source (21) is located opposite the inlet 

opening of all the beam (17) channels (20) with which it 
is associated. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that all the channels (20) are cylindrical. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that all the channels (20) have 

approximately the same dimensions. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that each beam (17) comprises at least 

five channels (20). 
Treatment apparatus for cerebral lesions using 
gamma radiation, including a device according to any one 

of claims 1 to 5 and a mobile patient-carrying table 
equipped with a stereotaxic device (26) intended to 

cooperate with the patient's head.
