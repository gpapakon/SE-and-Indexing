<ABSTRACT>
A theft-prevention device to be mounted on a parallelepipedic box, comprises a frame (10) for enclosing the box, said frame having an insert opening (11) for the box and a lock mechanism (13) provided on the frame, which has a rotary bolt (15) adjustable between an engaged and a disengaged position. The rotary bolt in the engaged position engages a hook-shaped lock tongue (29) which is displaceably and pivotably mounted to the frame to keep the lock tongue in a blocking position at the insert opening preventing withdrawal of the box from the frame. A latch mechanism which maintains the rotary bolt in the engaged position thereof can be actuated by means of an external element for releasing the rotary bolt for movement to the disengaged position in which the lock tongue can be moved away from the blocking position at the insert opening by displacement and pivoting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a theft-prevention device 
to be placed on a parallelepipedic box, comprising a 
frame constructed to enclose the box, said frame forming 
an insert opening for the box and having a lock mechanism 
including a lock bolt which can be adjusted between an 
engaged position and a disengaged position, said lock 
bolt preventing that a box inserted into the frame is 
withdrawn therefrom, and a latch mechanism maintaining 
the lock bolt in the engaged position thereof, which can 
be actuated by an external element for releasing the lock 
bolt for movement to the disengaged position and thus 
withdrawal of the box from the frame through the insert 
opening. A theft-prevention device of this type is described 
in WO 90/07183. The embodiment described therein is 
intended for boxes for compact discs and the like, a 
rotary bolt preventing withdrawal of the box from the 
frame by direct engagement with the box. There are, 
however, also other relatively expensive products which 
need to be protected against theft, and recorded video 
cassettes are one exampe of such products. These 
cassettes are available in boxes which are delivered, 
however, not by the manufacturer of the video cassette 
but by local distributors. The boxes which usually are 
made of plastic therefore are of many different types and 
as a consequence thereof are difficult to protect against 
theft because a theft-prevention device fitting a box of 
one type is not at all suitable for a box of another 
type. Moreover, these plastic boxes are clumsy and 
expensive.  
 A far better box for video cassettes is the 
cardboard box which is delivered by the manufacturer of 
the video cassette but only for unrecorded cassettes. The 
purpose of the present invention is to provide a theft-prevention 
device which is well suited for application to 
video cassettes in cardboard boxes so that the use of 
boxes of this type also for recorded video cassettes will 
be stimulated with the advantages associated therewith. A 
drawback of the cardboard boxes in this connection is, 
however, that the boxes are manufactured with great 
tolerances and that the cardboard box is yieldable and 
elastic. There may be dimensional deviations in the 
length and width measures of the cassette of the order of 
1.5 to 2 mm, and then, if the locking pin of the rotary 
bolt is of the order of 3 to 4 mm as in the present 
embodiments of the theft-prevention device according to 
WO 90/07183, intended for compact disc boxes, it is easy 
for less scrupulous

<CLAIMS>
A theft-prevention device to be placed on a 
parallellepipedic box, comprising a frame (10) 

constructed to enclose the box, said frame forming an 
insert opening (11) for the box and having a lock 

mechanism (13) which can be adjusted between an engaged 
position and a disengaged position, said lock mechanism 

preventing that a box inserted into the frame is 
withdrawn therefrom, and a latch mechanism (24) 

maintaining the lock mechanism in the engaged position 
thereof, which can be actuated by an external member for 

releasing the lock mechanism for adjustment to the 
disengaged position and thus withdrawal of the box fram 

the frame through the insert opening, 
characterized
 
in that the lock mechanism comprises a lock 

element (29) displaceably and pivotably mounted to the 
frame to be kept, in the engaged position of the lock 

mechanism, in a blocking position at the insert opening 
(11), wherein withdrawal of the box from the frame (10) 

is prevented, the lock element in the disengaged position 
of the lock mechanism being free to be withdrawn by 

displacement and pivoting from the blocking position at 
the insert opening. 
Theft-prevention device according to claim 1 
wherein the lock mechanism comprises a rotary bolt (15) 

engaging the lock element (29) in the engaged position of 
the lock mechanism to prevent displacement and pivoting 

of the lock element. 
Theft-prevention device according to claim 1 or 
2, wherein a support (14) is provided for the lock 

element (29) on the upper side thereof in the blocking 
position of the lock element to prevent the lock element 

from being swung upwards.  
 
Theft-prevention device according to any of 
claims 1 to 3 wherein the lock element (29) forms side 

projections (35) to be received in grooves in the 
blocking position of the lock element to prevent the lock 

element from being swung upwards. 
Theft-prevention device according to any of 
claims 1 to 4 wherein the lock element (29) forms a hook 

(33) which is slightly chamfered on the side facing the 
frame. 
Theft-prevention device according to claims 2 to 
5, wherein the lock element (29) forms a cut out (34) for 

engagement with the lock bolt (15). 
Lock means for the theft-prevention device according to claims 
1 to 6, comprising a lock mechanism (13) 

having a rotary bolt (15) which can be adjusted between 
an engaged position and a disengaged position and a latch 

mechanism (24) maintaining the rotary bolt in the lock 
position thereof, said latch mechanism being actuated by 

means of an external element for releasing the rotary 
bolt for movement to the disengaged position, 


characterized
 in that the rotary bolt (15) 
in the engaged position thereof engages a displaceably 

and pivotably mounted hook shaped lock tongue to keep 
said lock tongue in a blocking position, the lock tongue 

with the rotary bolt in the disengaged position being 
free to be withdrawn from the blocking position by 

displacement and pivoting.
