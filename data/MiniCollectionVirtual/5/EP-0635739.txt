<ABSTRACT>
An improved optical loop mirror is used in an optical 
demultiplexer to demultiplex time division multiplexed optical 

communications channels. High bit-rate optical pulses 
representing a plurality of time division multiplexed 

communications channels are input to a 3 dB coupler in an optical 
loop mirror. The coupler separates the high bit-rate optical 

pulses into two substantially equal high bit-rate pulse streams 
propagating in opposite directions around a loop of fiber in the 

mirror. Lower bit-rate optical switching pulses are injected 
into the loop so as to substantially coincide with selected 

pulses in the high bit-rate pulse stream corresponding to a 
communications channel to be demultiplexed from the plurality of 

multiplexed communications channels. A gain controlling element, 
such as an amplifier or a lossy element, in the loop changes the 

amplitude of one of the two high bit-rate pulse streams flowing 
in the loop so that the selectivity of the demultiplexer to the 

desired channel and the rejection of unwanted channels by the 
demultiplexer is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical demultiplexing. More
particularly, this invention relates to an optical demultiplexer
using an improved optical loop mirror.In high capacity optical communications systems, a plurality
of channels, each comprising a relatively low bit-rate optical
pulse stream, are time division multiplexed into a high bit-rate
pulse stream. For example, a plurality of relatively low bit-rate
optical soliton pulse streams may be combined into a single
high bit-rate optical soliton pulse stream. This multiplexing of
data streams, of course, requires that there be a subsequent
effective demultiplexing of the high bit-rate data into lower-rate
data, for example, demultiplexing 10 to 20 Gbit/sec. data to
the well-known 2.5 Gbit/sec. SONET rate. In Electronics Letters, vol 29, no 13, 24th June 1993, pages 1167-1168,
M. Eiselt and others disclose a purely optical technique for demultiplexing high speed
time division multiplexed data. The technique uses the SLALOM (semiconductor laser
amplifer in a loop mirror). The laser amplifier provides an optical non-linearity, so the
device does not rely on the small non-linearity of the fibre.In Proceedings on Photonics in Switching 1993, vol 16, Optical Society
of America, 15th March 1993, pages 211-214, J.P. Sokoloff and others disclose an
optical demultiplexer consisting of a loop minor with an additional 2 x 2 coupler for
control pulses and a non-linear element, consisting of a travelling-wave optical
amplifier biased to its transparency current.Demultiplexing apparatus according to the invention is set out in claim 1.
Preferred forms are set out in the dependent claims.Applicants have developed an improved optical demultiplexer which provides a nearly
square acceptance window in time, one-bit period wide, for pulses in one of a
plurality of time division multiplexed data channels. The acceptance window is
centered about the expected arrival times of selected optical pulses in a 
high bit-rate pulse stream. This demultiplexer provides high
switching efficiency for pulses of a desired channel and a nearly
complete rejection of the pulses in all other channels. The
on/off ratio may be 20 dB or better. The operation of the
multiplexer is stable and essentially unaffected by acoustic
fields and changes in ambient temperature. It is also compact,
inexpensive, and compatible with the usual fiber optic
environments.In a specific example of the invention, an improved loop
mirror is used to demultiplex a high bit-rate data channel into a
lower bit-rate data
