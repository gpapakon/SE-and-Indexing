<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control system for an internal combustion single cylinder gas engine adapted to control the timing pulse for spark ignition by measuring the timing pulse width and the cycle time to compute an advance and/or dwell time from an LUT corresponding to engine conditions from a leading edge of the timing pulse to the optimum interrupt/turn on point in advance of TDC wherein precise timing of the spark advance throughout a wide range of engine speeds can be achieved whereby efficient burning of a lean air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of the engine can be achieved to minimize undesirable exhaust gas emissions and to increase the operating engine efficiency. Adaptive threshold is applied to a waveform shaping circuit to suppress electronic noise at higher engine speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IGNITION TIMING CONTROLTechnical FieldThis invention relates to ignition timing controls for an internal combustion engine with a single cylinder.General Description Of The Invention And Discussion Of Background ArtA gas engine capable of incorporating the improvements of the invention may be seen by referring to United States application Serial No. 917764 , filed July 21, 1992, entitled "Lean Burn Internal Combustion Engine"; United States application Serial No. 911960 , filed Julv 10, 1992 , entitled "Fuel System and Constant Pressure Governor For A Single Cylinder Four Stroke Cycle Engine"; and United States applicationSerial No. 914360 , filed July 14, 1992 entitled "Carburetor Assembly For An Internal Combustion Engine." These applications are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The engine that is controlled by the control system of the invention is a single cylinder, natural gas engine adapted to drive a heat pump compressor in a residential heat pump installation. The engine control system includes a microcomputer that accepts input signals from engine sensors and from the heat pump controller. The engine control system includes three separate modules, the first being the microcomputer electronics unit for executing the appropriate ignition timing strategy for both the starting mode and the engine running mode, the second 

being the spark control unit for amplifying the signals developed by the electronics unit and for driving the ignition coil primary winding, and the third being a controller power supply. The electronics unit in a preferred embodiment of the invention is an Intel 8098 microprocessor adapted to receive input signals from engine monitoring sensors and operating commands from the engine control system. It acts upon the information received from the sensors and develops control signals to provide an appropriate response of a throttle stepper motor for varying the throttle position of a gas and air venturi carburetor, a natural gas supply valve, a fuel enrichment valve for assisting the carburetor assembly in developing an appropriate mixture for cold starting, the spark control unit, and the starter solenoid and motor relay. The throttle position that is established by the electronics unit provides for the most efficient engine starting condition and speed regulation. The electronics unit also achieves the optimal ignition timing and sequencing of the fuel valve and enrichment- valve.Ignition timing is based on a speed pickup signal from a magnetic proximity sensor
