<ABSTRACT>
The pressure-vessel closure proposed comprises a collar (1), fixed to the pressure-vessel, and a hatch cover (2). The two parts are held tightly against each other to form a seal by several clamps (3). At the top of the collar (1) is a sealing flange (12) with, underneath it, a bead (15) which is circular in cross-section and runs round the collar. The clamps (3) are mounted on the bead (15) so that they can be moved. A closure of this kind can be made entirely from turned parts, is very easy to design for different pressures and can be designed without much additional effort as a sterile closure.

<CLAIMS>
Closure for pressure vessels, comprising a collar (1) connectable to the 
pressure vessel and a cover (2), as well as a seal (5) located in the bearing 

area between the cover and the collar and several clamping members (3) for 
producing the surface pressure between the collar and the cover, characterized 

in that onto the collar is shaped in one piece a sealing flange (12), which 
has an upper, planar sealing face (13) and a lower, all-round, cross-sectionally 

at least partly circular bead (15), onto which are displaceably 
and detachably positively held several C-clamps (30) with in each case a 

clamping nut (31) as the clamping member (3) and which in the operating state 
press onto the marginal portion of the planar, plate-like cover (2) resting 

on the flange (12) of the collar. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that the collar (1) is a 
ring weldable to the vessel. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that the collar (1) is a 
ring (10) which can be screwed onto the vessel. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that the planar cover (2) 
has circumferentially uniformly distributed pressure faces (21), which are 

depressed with respect to the surface and having cup-shaped receptacles (22) 
for the clamping nuts (31) of the clamping members (3). 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that the marginal portion 
of the cover (2) has an all-round positioning groove (26), in which engages 

in the operating state a positively central, circular web (14), which projects 
over the sealing face (13) of the sealing flange (12) on the collar (1). 
Closure according to claim 5, characterized in that the circular web (14) 
on the flange (12) is inwardly displaced with respect to the inner edge at 

least by the width of a cross-sectionally semicircular groove (18) and that 
an O-ring (5) is placed in the groove. 
Closure according to claim 6, characterized in that on the underside of 
the cover is formed a cross-sectionally less than semicircular, all-round 

groove (27), which in the operating state is positioned above the corresponding  
 

groove (18) in the flange (12) of the collar (1). 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that in the upper leg (32) 
of the C-clamp (30) of the clamping member (3) is provided a taphole, whereas 

the lower leg (3) has a mouth (36) engaging round the bead (15), the centre 
axis of the taphole centrally intersects the mouth in the lower leg. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that the clamping member (3) 
is provided with a pin (37) bounding the mouth (36) of the C-clamp (30) and 

which brings about the self-closure of the mouth around the bead (15) by more 
than 180Â°. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterized in that the cover (2) is 
connected to the collar (1) by means of a hinge (4). 
Closure according to claim 9, characterized in that the hinge is formed 
by a clamping member (3), whose parts connecting the two legs of the C-clamp 

(30) are separated and connected by means of a pivot pin (41). 
Closure according to claim 10, characterized in that the pivot pin (41) 
is formed by a reamed bolt, which is surrounded by a helical compression 

spring (46).
