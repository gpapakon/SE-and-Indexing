<ABSTRACT>
A safety device for an evacuted blood-sampling tube holder 28 or a syringe 38 has a 
housing 8 flexibly connected to a base 4 and pivotable to a position where it aligns and locks 

with a needle 16 projecting from one end of the base. A cap 26 projects from the other end of 
the base to encircle the tube holder or syringe barrel. The cap 26 has notches 28 that engage 

fingers 30 projecting from the holder or barrel so that the device can be uncoupled after use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to safety devices of the kind including a base having a first end for 
connection with a needle and a housing flexibly connected to the base and pivotable to a 
position in substantial alignment along the longitudinal axis of the needle for enveloping the 
needle. In US4982842 there is disclosed a safety needle container, for use with a syringe, which 
protects a user from being accidentally pricked by the sharp end of a needle. US5139489 
describes a safety sheath mated to a holder for an evacuated tube, such as a vacutainer. In 
US5154285 there is described a device with a safety needle sheath rotatably mounted about the 
neck of a tube holder. The disclosures of the above patents are hereby incorporated to this 
application by reference. US 5139489 also discloses a variant in which the safety needle sheath is removable from 
the tube holder. However, this variant (shown in Figure 4 of US 5139489) requires that a 
specially designed safety needle sheath adapter be threadedly mated to a tube holder; and that 
after use, the housing be removed from the tube holder. This variant was found to be 
impractical because of its dimensional requirements. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved safety device for 
protecting a needle and which can be releasably coupled to a fluid receptacle. According to the present invention there is provided a safety device of the above-specified 
kind, characterised in that the device has a cap extending from a second end of the 
base for releasably coupling the base to a fluid receptacle.  The fluid receptacle may comprise a holder within which a fluid container is insertable. 
The needle preferably has a first end for insertion into a patient and a second end extending into 
the holder to be in fluid communication with the fluid container. The cap preferably extends 
from the second end of the base to a length at least as long as the second end of the needle. Alternatively, the fluid receptacle may be a syringe. The cap may be coupled to the receptacle via a first latch on the cap and a 
corresponding second latch on the receptacle. The housing may include a member for 
preventing relative movement between the housing and the needle once the housing has been 
pivoted to the alignment position. The retaining member may include at least one hook integral 
with the housing for securely retaining the needle within the housing to prevent relative 
movement between the needle and the housing. The housing may be rotatably mounted about

<CLAIMS>
A safety device including a base (4) having a first end for connection with a 
needle (16) and a housing (8) flexibly connected to the base and pivotable to a 

position in substantial alignment along the longitudinal axis of the needle for 
enveloping the needle, characterised in that the device has a cap (26) extending 

from a second end of the base (4) for releasably coupling the base to a fluid 
receptacle (28, 38). 
A safety device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the fluid receptacle 
comprises a holder (28) within which a fluid container is insertable. 
A safety device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the needle (16) has a 
first end (14) for insertion to a patient and a second end (18) extending into the 

holder (28) to be in fluid communication with the fluid container. 
A safety device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the cap (26) extends 
from the second end of the base (4) to a length at least as long as the second end 

(18) ofthe needle (16). 
A safety device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the fluid receptacle is 
a syringe (38). 
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the cap (26) is coupled to the receptacle (28, 38) via a first latch (29) on the 

cap and a corresponding second latch (30) on the receptacle (28, 38). 
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the housing (8) includes a member (9, 46) for preventing relative movement 

between the housing (8) and the needle (16) once the housing has been pivoted 
to the alignment position. 
A safety device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the retaining member 
includes at least one hook (9) integral with the housing (8) for securely retaining 

the needle (16) within the housing to prevent relative movement between the 
needle (16) and the housing (8). 
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the housing (8) is rotatably mounted about the base (4). 
A safety device according to any one of preceding claims, characterised in that 
the device includes fluid-absorbing material (44) mounted on the housing and 

configured to contact the needle (16) to absorb fluid thereon before the housing 
(8) is pivoted fully to the alignment position.
