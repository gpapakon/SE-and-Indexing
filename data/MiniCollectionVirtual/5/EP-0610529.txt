<ABSTRACT>
In the making of large-format thin panel-shaped elements from a material which sets and is pourable during processing, in particular gypsum, by the discharge method, movable cores (14) are used, by which the mould chambers (11) are subdivided into mould subchambers (15) after the casting slurry has been poured in. Following setting, the panel-shaped elements are discharged together with the movable cores (14) from the mould subchambers (15).

Process for the production of exact-sized panel-shaped 
elements (50) from a setting material capable of being 

cast during processing, in particular gypsum, in which 
the material in the form of a casting paste is poured 

into at least one moulding chamber (11) and this is 
then sealed to retain the shape and the casting paste 

is allowed to set in the moulding chamber at least 
until the elements formed from it are dimensionally 

stable, whereupon the elements are ejected from the 
moulding chamber then opened on one side and are 

passed on for further treatment, characterised in that 
the moulding chamber (11) is sub-divided into moulding 

chamber sections (15) by at least one movable core 
(14) acting in the manner of a partition wall, and 

that after setting, the elements (50) formed in the 
moulding chamber sections are ejected from the 

moulding chamber jointly with the core (14) 
respectively adjacent to them and are subsequently 

separated from the core before they are passed on for 
further treatment. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
during filling of the moulding chamber, each core is 

in a retracted filling position exposing the moulding 
chamber at least partially, and that after an 

appropriate quantity of casting paste has been poured 
into the moulding chamber, the core is moved forward 

into an operating position partitioning the moulding 
chamber sections (15) in which it remains until the 

casting paste has set. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterised in that  
 

in the filling position, the core is held in 
essentially the same position on the front side 

with adjacent closing elements (16) of the moulding 
chamber. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
approximately simultaneously with the forward movement 

of the core (14) into the operating position, the 
closing elements (16) of the moulding chamber (11) 

which are adjacent to it are moved back in the 
opposite direction into an end position, in which they 

are held until the casting paste sets and from which 
they are then moved forward together with the core 

into the ejection position, ejecting the elements 
(50). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a moulding box (6) is used, 

which contains several moulding chambers (11) 
partitioned by fixed, parallel intermediate walls 

(10), each of said chambers containing at least one 
movable core (14), and that the cores of all the 

moulding chambers are moved jointly. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
after reaching the ejection position, each core is 

moved back relative to the closing elements by a 
predetermined amount before the elements are separated 

from the core. 
Device for conducting the process according to one of 
the preceding claims, with a moulding box open at the 

top containing at least one moulding chamber, which is 
bounded by parallel walls arranged in pairs and is  

 
closed at the base by bar-shaped closing elements 

displaceably mounted in the moulding chamber and 
connected to an ejection device, through which they 

may be moved between a lowered end position and a 
raised ejection position, characterised in that in the 

moulding chamber (11) at least one panel- or disc-shaped 
movable core (14) acting in the manner of a 

partition wall is arranged which is aligned parallel 
to two side walls (9) of the moulding chamber and by 

means of which the moulding chamber may be sub-divided 
into moulding chamber sections (15), which are closed 

at the base by the closing elements (16) arranged on 
both sides of the core; that the core (14) is coupled 

to a control device (21, 22, 20), by means of which it 
is moved back and forth between a retracted filling 

position exposing the moulding chamber at least 
partially, an operating position partitioning the 

moulding chamber sections (15) and an advanced 
ejection position; and that the control device of the 

core is synchronised with the ejection device (31, 25) 
in such a manner that during the ejection movement of 

the closing elements (16) of the moulding chamber (11) 
on the base side, the core may be moved jointly with 

these into its ejection position. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
starting from the filling position, the closing 

elements (16) may be lowered into the end position by 
the ejection device (31, 25) while the core (14) may 

be moved forward into the operating position by the 
control device (21, 22, 20). 
Device according to Claim 8, characterised in that in 
the filling position, the core (14) is essentially  

 
flush on the face side with the closing elements (16) 

of the moulding chamber (11) adjoining on both sides. 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 9, 
characterised in that the closing elements have base 

bars (16) arranged on both sides of the respective 
core, and that all the base bars (16) are connected to 

a joint ejection device (31, 25). 
Device according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
the base bars (16) are connected to a base plate (25) 

which is mounted on a machine frame (2, 3, 5, 30) and 
coupled to at least one lifting or ejecting cylinder 

(31). 
Device according to Claim 10 or 11, characterised in 
that each core is guided in a sealed manner between 

the base bars (16) adjacent to it. 
Device according to one of Claims 10 to 12, 
characterised in that the base bars (16) are each 

constructed with a projecting moulding bar (17) 
corresponding to the tongue of an element (50). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
each core (14) is made of a dimensionally stable 

material with a highly polished, hard surface. 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 14, 
characterised in that each core is connected to a 

joint positioning device (21, 22, 20) for all cores. 
Device according to Claims 11 and 15, characterised in 
that the cores (14) are connected to a cross arm (20)  

 
mounted to move relative to the base plate (25) which 

is coupled to at least one lifting cylinder (21) 
arranged between the base plate (25) and the cross arm 

(20). 
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 16, 
characterised in that when the core (14) is in filling 

position, it stands on the face side with the closing 
elements (16) held at the same level at a distance 

(42) corresponding approximately to the height of a 
standard panel from the upper edge of the moulding 

chamber (6) corresponding in cross-section to the 
cross-sectional dimension
s of the standard panel.
