<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refuse processing machine for
processing refuse such as general domestic kitchen waste, and more
particularly to a refuse processing machine capable of reducing the bulk of
the refused by heating and drying kitchen waste to remove moisture contained
in the refuse. In this specification the words "waste" and
"refusal" are used as synonyms.As conventional refuse processing machines, the disposer for crushing
the waste to discharge into sewage, and waste dewatering machine for crushing,
dewatering and recovering the waste are known. The disposer contaminates the
river in the district without sewage treating plant, and causes environmental
pollution. On the other hand, the waste dewatering machine recovers the
dewatered waste and does not cause environmental pollution, but the recovered 
waste is likely to putrefy and release offensive smell when left untreated.
Accordingly, the deodorized and recovered waste must be stored at low
temperature, or frequently transported to the public garbage site for
treatment.Thus, the conventional refuse processing machines caused environmental
pollution, or required much later in the treatment after processing in the
refuse processing machine.To solve these problems, a heating type refuse processing machine for
drying and heating the waste has been proposed. That is, hot air is sent
into kitchen waste containing much moisture to remove moisture contained in
the waste, and the bulk of the waste is significantly reduced, and the waste
is heated to a dry state, and therefore it is hard to rot and release smell
if stored.In this refuse processing machine of heating type, however, it is
necessary to heat for a long time to remove much moisture contained in the
waste, and a long time is required for drying processing process. Or if
heated for a short time, moisture cannot be removed sufficiently and the
waste is left in half damp state, which causes malodor due to rotting, and
poses sanitary problems. WO-A-91/16134 describes a waste processing machine comprising a
waste container, grinding and stirring means and waste heating
means. Said grinding and stirring means comprise a rotary blade
provided at the inner bottom of the waste container. Patent
abstracts of Japan Vol. 17, No. 304 (M-1427) June 10, 1993, and
JP-A-05024601 describe a condensing unit for condensing the
steam generated from waste in a waste container of a waste
processing machine.It is the object of the present invention to solve the above
problems of the prior art
