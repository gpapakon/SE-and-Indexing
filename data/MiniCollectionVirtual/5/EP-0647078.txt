<ABSTRACT>
A multisite radio frequency (RF) signal transmission system has been 
developed that interconnects individual publicly trunked RF sites and handles 

encrypted data transmissions sent between multiple sites through a multisite 
switch. Each individual site controller having a digital voter includes a voter 

selector device that routes communications from either the site voter or 
multisite switch to a main site working channel at that site. Control messages 

are sent to the voter selection device from the multisite switch and site voter 
selection device that causes the voter selector to appropriately route 

communications to the working channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digitally trunked radio frequency (RF) signal 
transmission systems interconnected by a multisite switch. In particular, this 
invention relates to RF signal voting and data encryption, e.g., VoiceGuard, 
features of RF multisite systems. It is generally impractical for a single repeater transmitting radio site to 
effectively serve a large geographical area. The effective radiated power of 
the central site antenna is subject to legal and practical limits. In addition, 
natural and man-made topographical features, such as mountains and buildings, 
block signals from certain locations. Multiple transmitting sites are necessary to provide RF communications 
to all locations within a given locality. Each site has a site controller that acts 
as a central control point for communications in the site area. To enable 
communications from one site area to another, a multisite switch networks the 
individual radio site systems together to establish communication paths 
between a plurality of sites. Because of this multisite networking, a radio 
caller in one site area can communicate with someone in another site area. An 
example of a multisite radio network is described in U.S. Patents Nos. 
5,241,537; 5,200, 954 and 5,239,538, which are commonly assigned with this 
application and incorporated by reference. Individual RF sites broadcast from a central antenna location to mobile 
radio transceivers within the site area. The central broadcast is of sufficient  
 
power to adequately cover the site area. In contrast, the mobile radios 
transmit relatively low power signals that may not be received by the central 
antenna location. To receive mobile radio communications from throughout 
the site area, satellite antenna receivers are distributed in the site area. These 
remote satellite receiver stations are necessary to receive the relatively weak 
transmissions from mobile radios. The satellite receiver stations send the 
received mobile radio broadcasts to the central controller for the site which 
may rebroadcast (repeat) the mobile radio signal at relatively high power from 
the central antenna location to other radios in that site area. In addition, the 
central site controller may send the mobile radio broadcast to other sites and 
dispatcher consoles through a multisite switch. A single mobile radio broadcast may be received by several remote 
satellite stations. The single broadcast is sent in a redundant fashion by each 
of the satellite stations to the central controller. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A communications site for an RF trunked communication network having a plurality of 
communic
ation sites interconnected by a multisite switch, said communication site 
comprising: 

   a main site working channel including a central transceiver 
receiving and transmitting analog and digital communications, and a plurality 

of satellite receivers receiving analog and digital communications from remote 
RF units in a site broadcast area for said central transceiver; 

   a voter selector coupled to said main site working channel and 
having inputs of analog and digital RF communications received by the main 

site working channel and outputting selected analog and data communications; 
   a voter switch relay having inputs for selected analog and data 

communications from said voter selector and an input for analog and data 
communications from said multisite switch, and outputs for analog and data 

communications to said central transceiver and an output for analog and data 
communications to said multisite switch, said voter relay having a relay device 

for routing the communication inputs to the working channel transmitter and 
multisite switch, said routing being controlled by signals from said mulitisite 

switch and voter selector. 
A communication site as in claim 1 wherein the voter switch relay 
has a default setting for site originated, analog communications. 
A communication site as in claim 2 wherein in said default setting 
the voter switch relay routes an analog communication from said voter selector 

to both said central transceiver and said multisite switch. 
A communication site as in claim 1 wherein said voter selector, 
upon receiving a site originating data communication, sends a data select signal 

 
to said voter switch relay, and upon receipt of said data select signal, said 

voter switch relay routes data communications from said voter selector to said 
central transceiver and said multisite switch. 
A communications site as in claim 1 wherein said multisite switch 
sends a keying signal to said voter switch relay and, upon receipt of said 

keying signal, said voter switch relay routes a communication from said 
multisite switch to said central transceiver. 
A communication site as in claim 5 wherein said communication is 
a data communication from the multisite switch and said voter switch relay 

routes a data communication from said multisite input to a data 
communications output from said relay to said working channel. 
A communication site as in claim 1 wherein said voter switch relay 
further comprises a data select input connected to a digital voter selector in 

said voter selector, and a keying signal input from said multisite switch. 
A communications site as in claim 7 wherein said relay device 
comprises a plurality of switches operatively coupled to said inputs and outputs 

for analog and data communications, and said switches are controlled by a data 
select signal from said voter selector and a keying signal from said multisite 

switch. 
An RF trunked communications network comprising at least one 
communications site according to any one of the preceding claims.
