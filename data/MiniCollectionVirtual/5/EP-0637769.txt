<ABSTRACT>
A rod lens fixing method which can prevent the 
generation of cracks in a rod lens due to annealing to be 

carried out after welding a lens assembly. The rod lens 
fixing method includes the steps of providing a flanged 

split sleeve having an axial slit (25) extending continuously 
from one end of the flanged split sleeve to the other end 

thereof, the axial slit (25) being wide enough at at least a 
flange (24) of the flanged split sleeve to permit laser 

welding; press-fitting the rod lens (6) into the flanged split 
sleeve; and applying a solder into the axial slit (25) to 

solder the rod lens (6) to the flanged split sleeve. This 
method further includes the steps of inserting the flanged 

split sleeve into a bore formed at one end portion of a 
sleeve, the bore having a diameter larger than an outer 

diameter of the flanged split sleeve and smaller than an 
outer diameter of the flange; and laser-welding the flange 

to one end surface of the sleeve at a plurality of points 
on an outer circumference of the flange (24) and in the axial 

slit (25). The laser welding in the axial slit (25) of the flange (24) 
causes the acting of shrinkage forces in the flange to 

thereby prevent the generation of cracks in the rod lens (6) 
during the annealing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rod lens fixing 
method for fixing a rod lens in a sleeve to be used for an 
optical semiconductor module or the like by means of 
soldering and laser welding. In an optical communication system, for example, 
employing an optical fiber as an optical transmission 
line, an optical semiconductor module is used for the 
purpose of introducing an outgoing light from an optical 
semiconductor device such as a laser diode (LD) and a 
light emitting diode (LED) into the optical fiber. In the 
optical semiconductor module, the optical semiconductor 
device and an incident end surface of the optical fiber 
are fixed in a predetermined positional relation, and a 
condensing lens is provided therebetween. In this kind of 
optical semiconductor module, a relative positional 
relation between components has a direct influence upon an 
optical coupling efficiency. Accordingly, it is required 
to position each component with a high accuracy, e.g., 
1 µm or less. Moreover, it is also required to maintain  
 
such a positioning accuracy for a long period of time. Fig. 1A is an elevational view of a lens assembly 
manufactured by a lens fixing method in the prior art, and 
Fig. 1B is a vertical sectional view of the lens assembly 
shown in Fig. 1A. Reference numeral 2 denotes a flanged 
split sleeve formed at its one end with a flange 4. The 
flanged split sleeve is formed of stainless steel or the 
like. A condensing rod lens 6 is press-fitted in the 
flanged split sleeve 2, and is fixed by solders 8 and 9 to 
the flanged split sleeve 2 at a portion of an axial slit 5 
and opposite ends of the flanged split sleeve 2. To 
enable the rod lens 6 and the flanged split sleeve 2 to be 
welded together, an outer circumference of the rod lens 6 
and a predetermined portion of the flanged split sleeve 2 
are plated with gold. Thus, a lens assembly 10 is 
constructed. As shown in Fig. 2B, the lens assembly 10 is 
inserted into a stepped sleeve 12 from one end thereof, 
and as shown in Fig. 2A, the flange 4 is laser-welded to 
one end surface of the stepped sleeve 12 at four points P. 
On the other hand, a ferrule 14 connected to an optical 
fiber 16 is inserted into the stepped sleeve 12 from the 
other end thereof. After a relative positional relation 
between the rod lens 6 and the ferrule 14 in the stepped 
sleeve 12 is adjusted, the ferrule 14 is similarly laser-welded 
to the stepped sleeve 12. In this way, a fiber  
 
collimator (virtual fiber assembly) 18 is formed. After the lens
