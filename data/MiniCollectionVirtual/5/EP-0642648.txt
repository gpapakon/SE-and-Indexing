<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains generally to the field of
magnetic refrigeration, particularly to active magnetic
regenerative refrigeration apparatus, and to hydrogen
liquifiers.Active magnetic regeneration combines a
regenerator with a device which operates on the
magnetocaloric effect. The operation of active magnetic
regenerators is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,332,135 to
Barclay, et al. An experimental model of an active
magnetic regenerator has been built and tested and is
described in an article by A.J. DeGregoria, et al., "Test
Results of An Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigerator,"
Advances in Cryogenic Engineering, Vol. 37B, 1991. A
detailed model of the active magnetic regenerator is given
in an article by A.J. DeGregoria, Advances in Cryogenic
Engineering, Vol. 37B, 1991. An active magnetic regenerator is a type of
cooler or heat pump which utilizes the magnetocaloric
effect. Materials which exhibit the magnetocaloric effect
warm upon magnetization and cool upon demagnetization, or
vice versa. In a basic active magnetic regenerator (AMR)
device, a bed of magnetic material which is porous to a
heat transfer fluid is located between two heat exchangers,
with a mechanism provided for effecting reciprocating fluid
flow through the bed of magnetic material from one heat
exchanger to the other. A mechanism also is provided for
magnetizing and demagnetizing the bed. There are four
parts to a AMR cycle: bed magnetization, which warms the
magnetic material and the fluid in the bed by the
magnetocaloric effect; cold side to hot side fluid flow
through the bed with release of heat through a hot side
heat exchanger; bed demagnetization, cooling the magnetic
material and the fluid in the bed; and hot side to cold
side fluid flow through the bed, with the cooled fluid
absorbing heat at the cold side heat exchanger.An AMR device is an extension of the regenerator
concept. A regenerator is used to recover heat when fluid
is exchanged in a reciprocating fashion between two
reservoirs of different temperatures. The regeneration
cycle has two parts: flow from the cold reservoir to the
hot reservoir through the bed, followed by a flow from the
hot reservoir to the cold reservoir through the bed.In a regenerator device, the shuttle fluid is the
total fluid mass which flows in one direction prior to
reversal. After many reciprocating flows of the shuttle
fluid through the bed, the bed material establishes a
temperature profile which increases from the side at which
the cold fluid enters (the cold side) to the side at

forming input ports (209) near the axis of rotation of the wheel to
