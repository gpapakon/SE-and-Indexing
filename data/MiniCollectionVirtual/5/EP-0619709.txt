<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an eyelash
mascara applicator and mascara case therefor.The application of mascara to eyelashes is
typically performed by a wand with bristles disposed at
one end thereof. The wand is used in conjunction with
a cylindrical case or cover in which the mascara is
contained in paste form. By inserting the bristle-end of
the wand into the case, the bristles pick-up a supply of
mascara. The mascara is transferred to the eyelashes by
the user who grasps the wand at an end opposite the
bristles and moves the bristles against the eyelashes.One problem which has been encountered during the
use of such applicators results from the fact that the end
of the wand lies along the axis defined by the handle.
Thus, as the handle and wand are moved toward the eye,
there is presented a risk that the end of the wand will
contact and injure the user's eye.A mascara applicator purported to deal with that
problem is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,165,755. In that
applicator, the bristle end of the wand is mounted for
pivotal movement relative to the handle-end, so that the
bristle end can be oriented transversely relative to the
axis of the handle. However, the bristles will be located
on only one side of the wand, making it difficult to apply
mascara to the eyelashes located at both ends of the eye,
unless the user switches the wand from one hand to the
other during the application step. Also, such an applicator might be difficult to
use, if the bristle-end becomes somewhat unstable due to
the pivotal feature.Furthermore, it is necessary to displace the
bristle-end to a transverse relationship with the handle-end
each time that the wand is removed from the case.
This is inconvenient and also presents the possibility
that the user's fingers might come in contact with the
bristles and become soiled with mascara.The above-described shortcomings are also
characteristic of a mascara applicator disclosed in U.S.
Patent 4,428,388 wherein the bristle-end is displaced to
a transverse position by bending a non-elastically
flexible wand.The present invention is as defined by the appended claims
and relates to an eyelash
mascara applicator, and also to a combination of an
applicator and a mascara-containing case therefor.The applicator of the first aspect of the invention comprises
a handle and a wand
attached to the handle. The wand includes a first rod
portion extending from the handle and a second rod portion
extending transversely relative to the first rod portion.

including a first rod portion extending from said handle,
and a second rod portion extending transversely relative

to said first rod portion, bristles projecting outwardly
around the outer circumference of said second rod portion,

said second rod portion including first and second
opposite ends, said first rod portion intersecting said

second rod portion at a junction spaced from both of said
first and second ends, so that bristles are situated on

opposite sides of said junction.
An eyelash mascara applicator according to
claim 1, wherein said first and second rod portions are

formed of a stiff material.
An eyelash mascara applicator according to
claim 1, wherein said junction is located midway between

said opposite ends.
An eyelash mascara applicator according to
claim 1, wherein said junction lies closer to one of said

opposite ends than to the other.
An eyelash mascara applicator according to
claim 4, wherein said first rod portion extends at an

angle relative to a longitudinal axis of said handle, said
axis intersecting a midpoint of said second rod portion. 
An eyelash mascara applicator according to
claim 1, wherein said bristles are arranged in a helical

pattern.
An eyelash mascara applicator according to
claim 1, wherein said second rod portion is arcuate-shaped

such that a concave side thereof faces said handle.
In combination, an eyelash mascara case and
a mascara applicator insertable therein, said applicator

comprising a wand and a handle attached to said wand, said
wand including a first rod portion extending from said

handle and a second rod portion extending transversely
relative to said first rod portion, bristles projecting

outwardly around the outer circumference of said second
rod portion, said mascara case including a mascara-containing

section of oblong cross section shaped to
enable said wand to be inserted therein

while said second rod portion is oriented transversely to said first rod portion.
A combination according to claim 8, wherein
said second rod portion joins said first rod portion at a

junction spaced from two opposite ends of said second rod
portion so that bristles are situated on opposite sides of

said junction.
A combination according to claim 9, wherein
said junction is located midway between said opposite

ends.
A combination according to claim 9, wherein
said junction lies closer to one of said opposite ends

than to the other. 
A combination according to claim 11, wherein
said first rod portion extends at an angle relative to a

longitudinal axis of said handle, said axis intersecting
a midpoint of said second rod portion.
A combination according to claim 8, wherein
said first and second rod portions are formed of a stiff

material.
A combination according to claim 8, wherein
said bristles are arranged in a helical pattern.
A combination according to claim 8, wherein
said second rod portion is arcuate-shaped such that a

concave side thereof faces said first rod portion.
