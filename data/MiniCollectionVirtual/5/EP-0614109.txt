<ABSTRACT>
A system that produces sharper pictures by setting the 
lens (16,17) of a camera (13) to a closer focus position, when the flash 

unit (11) of the camera is set to a bounce position. In this 
system, the reflector and lamp of the flash unit are pivoted 

to direct the light produced by the flash unto an overhead 
ceiling. The focus position of the lens is adjusted by 

coupling the motion of the lamp to the motion of the lens element (16) so 
as to move the focus range of the lens (16,17) more nearly into the 

range of the bounce flash.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of 
photographic cameras, and particularly to photographic 
cameras that have built-in flash units. Many cameras have a built in flash unit. The flash 
unit is often located close to the optical axis of the 
camera lens. When the flash is located in the above 
position, flash from this position often results in 
unflattering illumination of the subject. Sometimes, the 
flash even enters the pupil of the eye of the subject and 
produces a condition called red eye. Red eye is caused by 
the reflection of the flash from the blood vessels in the 
retina, which is reflected back into the camera as red 
light. When the flash unit is raised above the lens, the 
condition called red eye is removed. The close association of flash unit and camera, even 
without red eye gives a rather uninteresting, flat form of 
lighting, which does not suit many subjects. To obtain more 
diffuse, softer lighting and hence better pictures the 
reflector assembly of the flash unit can be swivelled or 
tilted to produce a bounce flash. The typical bounce flash technique is to aim the flash 
unit at the ceiling, which then becomes a broad source of 
diffuse illumination, overcoming problems of light fall-off. 
If the flash unit has a provision for tilting, it can be 
used on a camera, if not it must be hand-held or mounted on 
some fixed support. Current camera systems typically include a flash unit 
for low light situations. The flash unit consists of a 
flash tube and a reflector that are designed to illuminate 
the scene area captured by the lens of the camera. When the 
shutter of the camera is opened, a capacitor discharges 
through the flash tube to create a burst of light. A large  
 
number of people would rather carry a smaller camera instead 
of a larger camera. Thus, the flash unit was made part of 
the camera to reduce the number of objects that an 
individual would have to carry and the flash unit was 
reduced in size to reduce the size of the camera. Hence, 
flash units on current small camera typically have a range 
of twelve feet. Larger flash units that supply greater 
illumination are not typically a part of small cameras or 
exist as independent flash units. When a bounce flash is utilized, the effective flash 
range of the flash unit is reduced by approximately two 
stops and bounce flash for a 12 foot flash range may be 
reduced to less than 8 feet. The foregoing may be overcome, 
by increasing the aperture size of the camera. Studies have shown that people desire to

A camera comprising a variable focal length lens 
adjustable to increase or decrease its focal length, and a 

flash unit, is characterized by: 
   means supporting said flash unit for movement between a 

normal position facing the same direction as said lens and a 
bounce flash position angled with respect to the direction 

said lens faces; and 
   means coupling said supporting means and said lens for 

decreasing the focal length of said lens as said flash unit 
is moved from its normal position to its bounce flash 

position and for increasing the focal length of the lens as 
the flash unit is swinging from its bounce flash position to 

its normal flash position. 
The camera claimed in claim 1, wherein said movement 
means may be incrementally positioned, while the focal 

length of said lens will be incrementally changed. 
A camera having one or more movable lenses and a 
flash, said camera characterized by: 

   means for incrementally positioning the flash from a 
normal flash position to a bounce flash position or from a 

bounce flash position to a normal flash position; and 
   means coupled to said positioning means for adjusting 

the movable lens so as to shift the focus of the movable 
lens by reducing the focus distance of the movable lens as 

the flash is incrementally positioned into a bounce flash 
position and by increasing the focus distance of the movable 

lens as the flash is incrementally positioned towards a 
normal flash position. 
The camera claimed in claim 3, wherein said 
positioning means comprises: a pivot that is coupled to the 

flash and the camera. 
The camera claimed in claim 4, wherein said 
adjusting means comprises: 

   a first member that is coupled to said pivot; and 
   a second member that is coupled to said first member 

and to the movable lens so that when the flash changes 
position said first member pivots about said pivot and said 

second member shifts the focus of the movable lens. 
The camera claimed in claim 3, wherein said 
adjusting means comprises: 

   a member that is coupled to said pivot; and 
   means coupled to said member and the movable lens for 

controlling the focus distance of the movable lens, wherein 
when said member pivots about said pivot said controlling 

means shifts the focus of the movable lens. 
The camera claimed in claim 6, wherein said 
controlling means comprises: 

   a switch that is coupled to said member; 
   a solenoid comprising a coil and a bar, said coil is 

capable of receiving current when said switch is closed and 
said bar is coupled to the moving lens so that when said 

switch is closed said bar will shift the focus of the 
movable lens; and 

   means for forcing the moving lens, said forcing means 
are coupled to the moving lens so that said forcing means 

will shift the focus of the movable lens when said switch is 
open. 
The camera claimed in claim 7, wherein said 
forcing means is a spring. 
A camera having one or more lenses, a movable 
diopter lens and a flash, said camera characterized by:

 
   means for positioning the flash from a normal flash 

position to a bounce flash position or from a bounce flash 
position to a normal flash position; and 

   means coupled to said positioning means for moving the 
diopter lens into the optical path to reduce the focus 

distance of the lenses as the flash is positioned into a 
bounce flash position and moving out of the path so as to 

increase the focus distance of the lenses as the flash is 
positioned towards a normal flash position.
