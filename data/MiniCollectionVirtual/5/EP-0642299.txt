<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for a complete, integrated cultivation of plants both in a plant nursery and/or in a pre-cultivation plant and also in an intermediate cultivation phase and at the consumer's place, whereby the plant is cultivated in a simple and cheap cultivation container/pot (1), especially of disposable type and filled with earth or a cultivation substrate and with the cultivation container standing with the bottom of the earth mass fully or partly in surface contact with a capillary moisture bed of a means emiting water and nutrient (fertilizer), and in which the plant (20), after having been cultivated for some time, and still in the same cultivation container (1) and without having subjected the roots or the foliage thereof, is moved and is put down on top of another capillary moisture bed and is cultivated or ultimately cultivated standing on top of said moisture bed. During the cultivation phases the plant can be subjected to various cultivation conditions without the need of being re-planted and without any actuation the roots or the foliage of the plant. When a plant is to be exchanged at the consumer's place (D) the entire cultivation container with the plant is removed from the moisture bed and is substituted by unit comprising a new cultivation container (1, 1') including a new plant which is just placed on top of the same moisture bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally related to a method and an apparatus
for cultivation of plants, and the invention is more particularly directed to a
system for "integrated cultivation of plants", by which expression is meant a
cultivation system comprising a long-time irrigation apparatus, in which
seeds are allowed to germinate and to propagate to tender plants standing
on a moisture bed,the plant thereby formed, as set in a larger, second simple disposable
container, named re-plantation container, is pre-cultivated or cultivated
at the plant purveyor's place, likewise standing on a moisture bed,whereupon the plant, still in the same container, and without any type of
re-planting, is moved to the consumer's place for ultimate growth of the
plant, whereby the plant, still in its re-plantation container, is placed
standing directly on top of a means for supplying water and nutrients
(fertilizer) to the plant,and whereby the plant, in advance thereof, may eventually be exposed
on an available cultivation bed or an irrigation apparatus in a plant storing
house or at a plant dealer's place.A cultivation system, in which the plant is pre-cultivated in a container
filled with earth or any type of cultivation substrate is known from the
Swedish patent having the laid out publication number 421.854, and
whereby the container has a water sucking foot which is immersed in a
water reservoir which is in common for many plant containers, and whereby
the plant is irrigated by use of the capillary forces simulating the irrigation in
the nature.The plant which has been pre-cultivated accordingly can later,
together with is re-plantation container, be moved outdoors or indoors for
ultimate cultivation of the plant, for instance in a cultivation apparatus of the
type which is known from the present inventor's own Swedish patent No
455.751, equivalent to the US patent Nr 5,050,343.The cultivation containers of said known systems are not intended for,
and also not useful for seed germination/propagation, since the feet which
are filled with earth (and water) generally give a too high water content for
having the seed germinate and to propagate in a suitable way. It even may
happen that the seeds become rotten in the environment created in the
known cultivation containers. Further, said known cultivation containers are
not suited for mounting of individual irrigation containers, for instance such 
containers which are known from the US patent No 4,156,324 in the name
of the present inventor himself, and in most cases the

standing in surface

contact with a moisture emitting bed, and in several successive stages
(B, C, D) in a second container (1') which, at the bottom thereof, has a
