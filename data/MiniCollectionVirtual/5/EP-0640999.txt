<ABSTRACT>
Effective arc-quenching is desired for current 
interrupters as defined to include circuit breakers, 

contactors, fuses and the like under conditions of operation 
where an electrical arc is produced that must be quenched to 

eliminate an undesirable current flow. An improved mode of 
arc-quenching coatings comprising urethane, melamine and 

acrylic based resin compositions containing inorganic nitrides 
such as boron nitride, aluminum nitride and silicon nitride 

are found to be effective as arc-quenching materials for 
current interrupters. Other coating compositions comprising 

urethane, melamine and inorganic nitrides mentioned above and 
high nitrogen organic compounds such as urea, hydantoin, 

allantoin, guanidine carbonate, guanine, melamine cyanurate 
and 1,3-diphenyl guanidine are also found to be effective as 

arc-quenching materials for current interrupters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to arc-quenching for 
current interrupters defined to include circuit breakers, 
contactors, fuses and the like, wherein under certain 
conditions of operation an electrical arc is produced that 
must be quenched to eliminate an undesirable current flow. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of 
arc quenching coatings on the surfaces of current interrupters 
exposed to arcs. In general, current interrupters having arc 
extinguishing apparatus for electrical contacts have been 
widely used to electrically interrupt power when overcurrent 
flows through power source lines. These circuit breakers 
typically have two types of arc extinguishing apparatus. In 
miniature circuit breakers, typically, in residential and 
light commercial installations, the contacts are enclosed in 
a chamber in the resin casing and partially surrounded by a 
metal shield as shown for example by U.S. Patent No. 
4,081,852. In larger circuit breakers such as that described 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,866,226 arc extinguishers typically 
comprise a plurality of stacked, substantially U-shaped arc 
extinguishing plates which surround the fixed and movable 
contacts of the circuit breaker. However, the second type is 
commonly used in European and Japanese miniature circuit 
breakers. When the current interrupter contacts are opened  
 
under fault conditions, creating an arc therebetween, the arc 
is driven and expanded in the direction of the extinguishing 
plates through electromagnetic action, causing the arc to 
divide into sections and be cooled down by the arc 
extinguishing plates so as to be extinguished. The arc extinguishing plates are typically 
surrounded by a non-conducting single or double side wall 
consisting of fiber, such as cotton, or wood pulp, plastic, 
such as phenolic materials, fishpaper material, or fiberglass. 
Holes are punched into these side walls to position and 
support the arc extinguisher plates, thereby creating the 
necessary spacing between the plates to enhance arc 
extinguishing capability. The protruding ends of the arc 
extinguisher plates are typically attached to the side wall by 
staking or spinning, the side wall and each pair of adjacent 
arc plates defining a chute for extinguishing the arc 
segmented by the plates. Arc-extinguisher side walls have in the past been 
formed of fibers within a melamine resin matrix, as disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,950,852. Such resins are used to provide 
a continuous source of arc-quenching gaseous
