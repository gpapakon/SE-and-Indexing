<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning apparatus having a spots cleaning blade (220) to remove residual 
agglomerations of particles from the imaging surface. The spots cleaning blade (220) is made 

from a material that has a low coefficient of friction, low resilience and higher hardness than a 
standard spots blade. These properties enable the spots cleaning blade (220) to provide a 

continuous slidable contact with the imaging surface to remove residual particles therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus,
for cleaning the residual materials from an imaging surface
and more particularly,
concerns a cleaning apparatus for removal of residual particles and agglomerates from the
imaging surface.In an electrophotographic application such as xerography, a charge retentive surface
is electrostatically charged, and exposed to a light pattern of an original image to be
reproduced to selectively discharge the surface in accordance therewith. The resulting pattern
of charged and discharged areas on that surface forms an electrostatic charge pattern (an
electrostatic latent image) conforming to the original image. The latent image is developed by
contacting it with a finely divided electrostatically attractable powder referred to as "toner".
Toner is held on the image areas by the electrostatic charge on the surface. Thus, a toner image
is produced in conformity with a light image of the original being reproduced. The toner
image may then be transferred to a substrate (e.g., paper), and the image affixed thereto to
form a permanent record of the image to be reproduced. Subsequent to development, excess
toner left on the charge retentive surface is cleaned from the surface. The process is well
known, and useful for light lens copying from an original, and printing applications from
electronically generated or stored originals, where a charge surface may be imagewise
discharged in a variety of ways. Ion projection devices, where a charge is imagewise deposited
on a charge retentive substrate, operate similarly.Although a preponderance of the toner forming the image is transferred to the
paper during transfer, some toner invariably remains on the charge retentive surface, it being
held thereto by relatively high electrostatic and/or mechanical forces. Additionally, paper
fibers, Kaolin and other debris have a tendency to be attracted to the charge retentive surface.
It is essential for optimum operation that the toner remaining on the surface be cleaned
thoroughly therefrom.A commercially successful mode of cleaning employed on automatic xerographic
devices utilizes a brush with soft conductive or insulative fiber bristles. While the bristles are
soft they are sufficiently firm to remove residual toner particles from the charge retentive
surface. A voltage is applied to the fibers to enhance removal of toner from the charge
retentive surface.Not all toner and debris is removed from the surface by the brush cleaner. For
reasons that are unclear, toner particles

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning the residual materials from an imaging surface (10),
including:


a holder (225) attached to a housing (145);
a primary cleaner (100), at least partially enclosed in said housing (145); and
a resilient blade (220), having a resiliency ranging from about 20% to about 25% rebound, located
upstream in the direction of motion (12) of said imaging surface from said primary cleaner (100), said

blade, having a high hardness with a durometer value ranging from about 80 Shore A to about 90
Shore A, and having one end coupled to said holder (225) and a free end opposite thereto, said free

end being arranged for pressure contact with the imaging surface (10) having a minimal coefficient of
friction therebetween enabling said free end to be in continuous slidable contact with said imaging

surface.
