<ABSTRACT>
A dry analytical film chip comprising a support, at 
least one reagent layer, and a spreading layer laminated in 

this order, and comprising at least one of a means for 
preventing a liquid sample supplied onto and then spread 

into the spreading layer from reaching corner portions, a 
means for preventing a liquid sample supplied onto and then 

spread into the spreading layer from reaching edges, a 
means for preventing the formation of frays at edges of the 

spreading layer which is composed of a fibrous porous 
material, and a means for preventing a liquid sample 

supplied onto and then spread into the spreading layer from 
effusing out of edges, provided in the spreading layer. 

The dry analytical film chip can prevent the staining of an 
analyzer therefor at the side wall of the placing part of 

the incubator, the photometric portion, the discharging 
portion and the like caused by the effusion of liquid sample 

at edges of the dry analytical film chip, and the formation 
of frays at edges of a spreading layer composed of fibrous 

porous material, such as fabric, nonwoven fabric of filter 
paper, and capable of further preventing the generation of 

fiber dust.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dry analytical film chip
which is a small piece of dry analytical film cut into a
specific form, such as square, rectangle, circle or
ellipsoid. The dry analytical film has a reagent layer
wherein chemical reaction, biochemical reaction or
immunological reaction occurs with a predetermined
biochemical substance (hereinafter referred to as analyte)
contained in a sample solution, such as blood or urine to
produce an optical density change.In general, to analyze qualitatively or quantitatively
a specific component or an activity of a specific component
in a sample solution is conducted in various industrial
fields. Particularly, it is very important to analyze
quantitatively the content or activity of a biochimical
component or the content of a solid component of a body
fluid, such as blood or urine, of an organism in the field
of linical biochemical analysis.Recently, various dry integral multilayer analytical
films (also called multilayer analytical element) have been
developed which can determine the content or activity of a
specific analyte or the content of a specific solid
component by merely spotting a small droplet of a sample
solution (JSP 3,992,158, USP 4,292,272, Japanese Patent KOKAI
No. 57-42951, etc.), and put tn practical use. Filter 
paper-type test pieces and modifications thereof composed of
single layer or multilayers were also proposed (USP
4,477,575), and are, in part, put to practical use. Since
a sample solution can be analyzed simply and rapidly by
using the dry analytical films compared with conventional
wet analysis to use the dry analytical films is particularly
useful for a medical organization or laboratory where a
great number of sample solutions are analyzed.As a method of analyzing an analyte of a sample
solution quantitatively by using the dry analytical film,
the sample solution was spotted onto the dry analytical
film (when there is a spreading layer, onto the spreading
layer, on the other hand, when there is no spreading layer,
onto the reagent layer directly), and is kept at a definite
temperature (incubated) for a predetermined period in an
incubator (oven) to induce a coloring reaction (dye-forming
reaction). Subsequently, light for measurement containing a
wavelength, which has been previously selected by the
combination of a specific analyte in a sample solution and
a reagent contained in a dry analytical film, is irradiated
to the dry analytical film, and the optical density is
measured. The concentration or activity of the analyte in
