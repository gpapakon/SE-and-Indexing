<ABSTRACT>
A biosensor (1) and method for determining the hematocrit level of a whole blood sample (11) using electrochemistry. The biosensor (1) includes working (4) and counter (5) electrodes. A porous membrane (9) is impregnated with an electroactive compound and is spatially displaced from the surface of the electrodes (4, 5). When a whole blood sample (11) is applied to the porous substrate (9), a mixture of the electroactive compound and the blood (11) is formed. The mixture settles on the electrodes (4, 5) and a potential difference is applied sufficient to oxidize or reduce the electroactive compound and generate a current. This current can be measured and correlated to hematocrit level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to determining the hematocrit of a whole blood sample,
specifically through the use of a biosensor and electrochemical techniques.Hematocrit is the volume of red blood cells expressed as a percentage of the volume
of whole blood in a blood sample. Hematocrit is used clinically to characterize blood. A low
hematocrit indicates anemia (a low number of red blood cells and thus a reduced capacity for
the blood to carry oxygen) and a high hematocrit may indicate polycythemia (a high number
of red blood cells which may be a warning signal of serious circulatory failure). Hematocrit
determination in the lab may provide an early diagnosis of these conditions.U.S. Patent No. 4,068,169 (Angel et al.), issued January 10, 1978, discloses the
measurement of hematocrit by passing a diluted volume of blood through sensing means,
wherein conductivity changes in response to the presence of red blood cells passing through
the sensing means.U.S. Patent No. 4,547,735 (Kiesewetter et al.), issued October 15, 1985, discloses a
hematocrit measuring device that includes upper and lower spatially displaced electrodes. A
blood sample is added to the device and hematocrit level is correlated to changes in
impedance of the blood sample.U.S. Patent No. 4,699,887 (Abbott et al.), issued October 13, 1987, discloses a
method of measuring the hematocrit level of blood by measuring the concentration of a
marker (i.e. sodium ion) that has a different concentration in red blood cells versus plasma
before and after lysing the red blood cells. The change in concentration of the marker after
lysis can be correlated to the hematocrit level in the original blood sample.U.S. Patent No. 4,876,205 (Green et al.), issued October 24, 1989, discloses an
electrochemical assay for hemoglobin, wherein red blood cells are lysed and hemoglobin is
assayed by monitoring the current changes produced on reduction of ferricyanide to
ferrocyanide by hemoglobin. U.S. Patent No. 3,922,598 (Steuer et al.), issued November 25, 1975, discloses an
electrochemical apparatus for measuring hematocrit level of whole blood. The apparatus
includes a pair of electrodes, a constant current source, and is calibrated so a plasma sample
will give a reading of zero. When a probe is exposed to whole blood, the output voltage
swings negatively. The magnitude of this negative swing in voltage may be correlated to
hematocrit level.In addition, U.S. Patent No. 4,835,477 (Metzner et al.), issued May 30, 1989, U.S.

A biosensor for measuring the hematocrit level of a blood sample, comprising:

(a) a first insulating substrate;
(b) working and counter electrodes affixed to the first insulating substrate;
(c) a second insulating substrate, which overlays the working and counter electrodes,
has a window for exposing a portion of the working and counter electrodes, and has a

cut out portion at one end to allow contact between the electrodes and a meter and a
power source; and
(d) the oxidized and reduced forms of a reversible electroactive compound which is
either dispensed directly into the window of the second insulating substrate or

impregnated into a porous substrate which overlays the window, and is spatially
displaced from the working and counter electrodes so that there is an empty space

between the working and counter electrodes and the porous substrate prior to addition
