<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum insulating and construction materials (1) are provided by producing bubble containing, solid materials such as individual bubbles, multiple bubbles, foamed material, and the like in an environment of less than atmospheric pressure and enclosing the bubbles produced in an air-tight encapsulating material (5) while still in the environment of less than atmospheric pressure. On being moved into an environment of atmospheric pressure the bubbles retain their vacuum quality.

 VACUUM INSULATING AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to insulation and construction materials. In one of its aspects it relates to material used for thermal and acoustic insulation. In another of its aspects it relates to vacuum insulation materials i.e. insulating materials containing enclosed spaces in which the pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. In another of its aspects this invention relates to construction materials containing enclosed spaces in which the pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. In yet another of its aspects this invention relates to ultralight construction materials. In still another of its aspects this invention relates to the production of vacuum insulation materials. In still another of its aspects this invention relates to the production of construction materials containing enclosed spaces in which the pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. v 2. Description of the Prior ArtVacuum insulation techniques have been known for use in various applications for both thermal and acoustic insulation material. Such material makes use of the advantage of having a reduced number of molecules in a vacuum chamber encapsulated within the material so that the transfer of heat or sound is reduced as compared to material having chambers encapsulating gases at atmospheric pressure or higher pressures. Obviously, the greater the 

reduction of pressure within a vacuum chamber the more effective will be the barrier to the transfer of heat or sound energy through the chamber and increasing the ratio of open space to supporting structure also reduces the transfer of heat or sound through an insulating material. While several approaches have been tried in the production of vacuum insulation the most common schemes have relied on producing air-tight enclosing structures that are supported from within by loosely packed filler which upon the evacuation of gas from the structure prevents the structure from collapsing on itself, but still provides interstices between the units of filler from which gas can be withdrawn. After the evacuation of gas, the structure is sealed to maintain the vacuum. Other production approaches enclose within a single air-tight, outer structure a multiplicity of either elongated, relatively flat, air-tight, bag structures or elongated, sausage-shaped, air-tight structures of relatively small diameter, either of which are supported on the inside by microporous insulation material. Gas is withdrawn
