<ABSTRACT>
The use of O-esters of L-carnitine with aromatic acids, 
such as salicylic, acetylsalicylic, nicotinic and 

trimethoxybenzoic acid is disclosed for producing 
pharmaceutical compositions suitable to be topically 

applied for treating dermatoses, such as ichthyosis and 
psoriasis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of O-esters of
L-carnitine with aromatic acids for producing
pharmaceutical compositions which contain such esters as
active ingredients, suitable to be topically applied for
the treatment of dermatoses.These esters have the formula (I)
wherein Ris the acyl of an aromatic acid, andX-is the anion of a pharmacologically
acceptable acid.Specifically, the esters which are particularly
preferred are those wherein the acid is selected from
salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, nicotinic acid and
trimethoxy benzoic acid.Encompassed by the esters to be used according to the
present invention are also the inner salts of the
compounds of the formula (I). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound
according to the invention
include, in addition to the inner salts, all
pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are prepared
by the addition of acid to L-carnitine, and which do not
give rise to undesirable toxic or collateral effects.The formation of pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition salts is well known in pharmaceutical
technology.Non-limiting examples of suitable salts include the
chloride, bromide, orotate, acid aspartate, acid
citrate, acid phosphate, fumarate, acid fumarate,
lactate, maleate, acid maleate, acid oxalate, acid
sulfate, glucose phosphate, tartrate and acid tartrate
salts.The esters of L-carnitine and the aforesaid alkanoyl L-carnitine
with Î²-hydroxybutyric acid and the
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof are known
compounds.For instance, EP 0443996 A1 discloses the activity of
these esters in inhibiting neuronal degeneration (as it
occurs e.g. in Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's
disease) and liver proteolysis and in the treatment of
coma. The dermatoses which are suitably treated with
compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) are in particular
ichthyosis, psoriasis and those dermatoses which are
induced by a defective keratinization, such as dandruff,
acne and palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis.Ichthysosis is a dermatosis characterized by generalized
dryness, harshness and scaling of the akin. It may
occurs as a hereditary disease present at birth, or as a
metabolic disorder associated with hypothyroidism or
with the intake of drugs (such as butyrophenols)
inhibiting lipid synthesis, or as a paraneoplastic
syndrome, manifestation of a tumor process involving
internal organs.Xeroderma, the mildest form of ichthyosis is neither
congenital nor associated with systemic abnormalities.It usually occurs on the lower legs of middle-aged
