Roll stand adjusting method for adjusting the 
desired roll force and desired roll gap of a roll stand, 

in which before rolling a strip (1) of a prescribed 
quality from an expected material hardness (MH*) and 

before a relative desired pass reduction (ε*) given from 
a pass schedule the desired roll force (F*) is computed 

taking account of stand-specific and/or material-specific 
roll force fitting terms (KFK, KMK) and with simplification 

by means of a simple arithmetic combination, that is 
to say using only the four fundamental operations of 

arithmetic, and then the desired roll gap (S*) is computed, 
with simplification by means of a simple arithmetic 

combination, from the desired delivered thickness 
(HA*) given by the relative desired pass reduction (ε*), 

the stand modulus (CG) and the desired roll force (F*), 
taking account of a zero-point correction (SO), a 

temperature correction (SOT), and, as the case may be, a 
roll gap fitting term (KSK), and the stand (6) is 

subjected to the desired roll force (F*) and the desired 
roll gap (S*). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the desired roll force (F*) is computed in 

accordance with the formula 

F* = ε* · MH* · KFK · KMK 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the desired roll gap (S*) is computed in accordance 

with the formula  
 


S* = HA* - CG · F* + SO + SOT + KSK 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that 


during rolling the actual roll force (F), the actual 
roll gap (S) and the actual rotational speed (n) of 

the stand (6) are measured, 
the actual delivered thickness (HA) of the strip (1) 
is determined from the actual rotational speed (n) 

taking account of the forward slip (v), 
the actual delivered thickness (HA) is compared with 
the actual delivered thickness (HA') expected on the 

basis of the model taking account of the actual roll 
force (F) and the actual roll gap (S), and 
on the basis of this comparison a correction factor 
is computed for one of the stand-specific parameters 

(CG, SO, SOT), for example for the zero-point 
correction (SO). 
Method according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterised 
in that 


during rolling the actual roll force (F) is 
measured, 
the actual pass reduction (ε) is determined, 
on the basis of these actual quantities (F, ε) a new 
stand-specific fitting term (KFK') is determined, 

and 
a correction factor is determined for the fitting 
term (KFK) by means of the comparison of the newly 

calculated fitting term (KFK') with the previously 
used fitting term (KFK). 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised 
in that the correction factors, weighted with a 

confidence factor (V), are added to the previous fitting 
terms, the confidence factor (V) being larger the more 

precisely it is possible to measure the actual values (F, 
S, n, HA, ε). 
Method according to Claim 4, 5 or 6, in which 
directly after the last-rolled strip a strip of the same  

 
quality is rolled, characterised in that in order to 

compute the desired roll force (F*) and desired roll gap 
(S*) for this strip fitting terms (KFK, KMK, KSK) are 

determined by means of which a complete compensation of 
the deviation last determined between the actual 

delivered thickness (HA) and expected delivered thickness 
(HA') is to be expected. 
Method according to one of the above claims, 
characterised in that the desired values (F*, S*) are 

stipulated only for the start of the strip (1), and the 
desired value stipulation is replaced after the start of 

rolling by thickness control. 
Method according to one of the above claims, 
characterised in that a plurality of sets of measured 

values are recorded per strip (1), and mean values and 
confidence intervals are computed from these measured 

value sets. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the computation of the mean values and of the 

confidence intervals is performed in groups. 
Method according to one of the above claims, 
characterised in that it is applied in a multi-stand 

rolling mill, preferably in a continuous rolling mill.
