<ABSTRACT>
A milk substitute in the form of an unreconstituted powÂ­
der, containing more than 10% casin, is given an extended 

storage life following reconstitution by the presence of a 
pH-responsive preservative, such as propionate, an edible 

acid, such as malic acid, which generates a pH in the milk 
substitute immediately after reconstitution in the range 6 to 

5.2, and optionally a water-soluble phosphate.
