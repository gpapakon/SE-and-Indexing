<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymerization 
process in aqueous emulsion of fluorinated olefinic 
monomers, in which hydrogenated chain transfer agents are 
used, in association with branched chain aliphatic alcohols. It is known to utilize hydrogen or hydrocarbons or 
fluorohydrocarbons having low molecular weight as chain 
transfer agents in polymerization reactions in aqueous 
emulsion of fluorinated olefinic monomers, optionally in 
association with fully hydrogenated olefins. Such transfer 
agents show the advantage of giving non-polar end groups, 
more stable than the end groups obtainable with other chain 
transfer agents (such as methanol). For instance, in US Patent 3,635,926 a copolymerization 
process of tetrafluoroethylene with perfluoroalkylvinylethers 
in aqueous emulsion is described, wherein hydrogen, 
methane or ethane are used as chain transfer agents. To 
obtain a sufficient chain transfer effect, it is necessary 
to employ such transfer agents, which are all above the 
critical temperature in the usual polymerization conditions, 
with high partial pressures. Consequently, by acting at the 
same operating pressure, it is obtained a reduction in the 
monomer partial pressure, and therefore an increase of the 
low molecular weight fractions in the final product, with 
unavoidable worsening of the mechanical properties. To avoid  
 
that, the operating pressure could be increased, but this 
would cause evident plant drawbacks, particularly when 
tetrafluoroethylene is used, for which it is recommended for 
safety reasons operating at a pressure as low as possible. US-A-4,360,652 discloses the use of isopropylalcohol as chain transfer agent in the 
emulsion polymerization of vinylidene fluoride. EP-A-367727 discloses the use of ter-butylalcohol together with CCl2FCCl2F in the 
emulsion copolymerization of tetrafluoroethylene and ethylene to increase the reaction 
speed and to control the molecular weight. The Applicant has now surprisingly found that it is 
possible to considerably increase the efficiency of the 
hydrogenated chain transfer agents by adding to the reaction 
mixture a branched chain aliphatic alcohol. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention a 
radical (co)polymerization process of one or more 
fluorinated olefinic monomers, optionally in association 
with one or more non-fluorinated olefins, wherein said 
monomers are (co)polymerized in aqueous emulsion, in the 
presence of a hydrogenated chain transfer agent selected 
from hydrogen, aliphatic
