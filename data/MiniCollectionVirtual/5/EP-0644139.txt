<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sheet feeder unit having a suction head unit 5, by means of which sheets can be removed, individualised, from a sheet stack 2, can be fed to a belt table 8 and can be supplied by the belt table 8 to a sheet-processing machine 11. Suction head unit 5 and belt table 8 can be driven in time with the sheet-processing machine 11. The actual instant of reaching the transfer position to the sheet-processing machine 11 can be detected by means of the respective frontmost sheet located on the belt table 8 and can be compared with a desired instant. Furthermore, the operating cycle of the suction head unit 5 can be corrected, leading or lagging, in accordance with the deviation of the desired instant from the actual instant.

<CLAIMS>
Sheet feeder unit with a suction head unit by means 
of which the sheets can be individually taken from a 

sheet pile and fed to a belt table as well as being 
feedable from the belt table to a sheet processing 

machine, wherein suction head unit and belt table can be 
driven matched to one another and wherein a position of 

the transported sheet representing an actual point in 
time can be sensed and can be compared with a desired 

point in time representing a working position of the 
sheet processing machine as well as on deviation of the 

desired point in time from the actual point in time, the 
working rhythm of the suction head unit being correctable 

corresponding to the deviation in advance or in retard, 
characterised in that suction head unit and belt table 

can be driven in the rhythm of the sheet processing 
machine and the actual point in time is the point in time 

of reaching of the dispensing position of the frontmost 
sheet relative to the sheet processing machine and that 

the course of movement of the belt table (8) during a 
working cycle is substantially sinusoidal, wherein the 

desired point in time is the point in time of lowest feed 
speed of the belt table (8). 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the transfer of the sheets from the 

suction head unit (5) to the belt table (8) takes place 
substantially at the point in time of the lowest feed 

speed of the belt table (8). 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the actual point in time of 

reaching the dispensing position can be sensed by a 
sensor (19). 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 3,  
 

characterised in that by means of the sensor (19), the 
reaching of the dispensing position by the front edge of 

the frontmost sheet can be sensed. 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that several sensors are arranged 

distributed across the sheet width. 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the average switchover point in 

time of the sensors forms the actual point in time. 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the sensor(s) is/are optical 

sensor(s) (19). 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the sensor(s) is/are light 

reflection sensor(s). 
Sheet feeder unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that suction head unit (5) and belt 

table (8) have separate drives (12, 13). 
Sheet feeder unit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the signal(s) of the 

sensors (19) as well as a timing signal of the belt table 
(8) can be fed to processing electronics (16) and from 

this the positive or negative deviation of the actual 
point in time from the desired point in time can be 

determined as well as a corresponding direction signal 
being derivable for the advancing or retarding of the 

working rhythm of the drive (12) of the suction head (5). 
Sheet feeder unit according to one of Claims 1 - 9, 
characterised in that the drive of the suction head is 

adjustable in advance or retard manually.
