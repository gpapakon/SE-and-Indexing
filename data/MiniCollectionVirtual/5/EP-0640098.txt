<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to canine
coronavirus infections, and specifically to proteins useful
in prophylaxis, therapy, and diagnosis of these infections
in canines.The coronaviruses are a large family of mammalian
and avian pathogens which were first described in 1968.
They are the causative agents of several diseases including
encephalitis, hepatitis, peritonitis and gastroenteritis.
Enteric coronaviruses have been detected in the feces of
man, pigs, calves, cats, mice, chickens and dogs.Canine coronavirus (CCV) enteritis was first
isolated from dogs suffering an acute gastroenteritis, as
reported by Binn et al., Proc. 78th Ann. Mtg. U.S. Animal
Health Assoc., Roanoke VA, pp. 359-366 (1974). The disease
became prevalent during the 1970s. CCV gastroenteritis
appears to be primarily transmitted through fecal
contamination from infected dogs via the oral route, 
leading ultimately to replication of the virus in the
epithelial cells of the small intestine. Virus can be
recovered from the feces of an infected dog between 3 and
14 days after infection.CCV gastroenteritis is characterized by a mild
depression, anorexia and loose stool from which the dog
usually recovers. The onset of the disease is often
sudden, accompanied by such symptoms as diarrhea, vomiting,
excreted blood in stools, and dehydration. Deaths have
occurred within as little as 24 to 36 hours after onset of
clinical signs. Most dogs appear afebrile but elevated
body temperature is seen in some cases. Often CCV will
occur with a canine parvovirus infection and this
coinfection can be fatal.Serologically the disease is closely related to
transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV).
Although canine coronavirus does not infect pigs,
transmissible gastroenteritis virus produces a subclinical
infection in dogs. However, unlike the feline infectious
peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV), previous exposure to CCV
does not predispose dogs to enhanced disease; and antigen-antibody
complexes, if formed, are not associated with
disease pathology.A canine CCV vaccine comprising CCV peplomer protein is disclosed in US 4 904 468.There remains a need in the art for compositions
useful in diagnosing, treating and preventing infections
with canine coronaviruses.In one aspect the present invention provides the
complete nucleotide sequence of the CCV S gene, strain 1-71,
SEQ ID NO:1. The S gene may be
useful in diagnostic compositions for CCV infection.In another aspect the present invention provides
a CCV S (or spike) protein characterized by
