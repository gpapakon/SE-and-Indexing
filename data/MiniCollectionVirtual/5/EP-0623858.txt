<ABSTRACT>
A request signal having a command designating a coded rule is output from the controller (81) of a PPC to the CPU (45f) 
of a toner cartridge. The controller receives from the cartridge CPU (45f) a signal responding to the request signal to collate the 

response signal and judgment data stored in a ROM (82). Thus, depending on whether or not the response signal corresponds to 
the coded rule designated, the compatibility of the toner cartridge is judged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an image forming apparatus, such as a copying
apparatus, having a developing-agent replenishing
device as an exchangeable replenishing device, such as
a toner cartridge, for replenishing a toner (developing
agent) to a developing device that visualizes, for
example, an electrostatic latent image with the toner.In recent years, a copying apparatus in which a
toner cartridge is mounted on a developing device and a
toner is replenished from the toner cartridge has been
put to practical use.A copying apparatus of this type has a removable
toner cartridge. The cartridge is exchanged when the
toner in the cartridge runs out.Generally, in the copying apparatus of this type,
it is preferable to use a toner cartridge the
manufacturer guarantees in accordance with the structure
and standards of the machine frame.In most conventional copying apparatuses, however,
the toner density in the developing device is checked,
and toner replenishment from the cartridge is 
controlled. When the toner density does not reach
a predetermined value even after toner replenishment has
been performed for a predetermined period of time, it is
instructed that the user exchange the cartridge.Since it is the user who exchanges the toner
cartridge, a standard cartridge guaranteed by the
manufacturer is not always used.Even when a non-guaranteed toner cartridge (other
than the standard product) is used, a certain degree of
copying performance is ensured. In this case, however,
the performance of the copying apparatus is not fully
attained, and a trouble may be caused.In the field of the copying apparatus, a technique
of detecting whether or not a developing device has been
installed in the full-color copying machine has already
been proposed, as is disclosed in, for example, Jpn.
JP-A-(KOKAI)-2-93480,Also,
JP-A-(KOKAI)-63-193156, for example, discloses an image forming
apparatus, in which a specific binary pattern identification
number marked at one end of a unit integrally
comprising a photosensitive drum and a developing device
is read when the unit is mounted in the main body, so
that a mounting error of the unit can be recognized.However, the arrangement for identifying the developing
devices according to these proposals can be easily
imitated. A strong demand has arisen for an appropriate
countermeasure for a toner cartridge that can be
imitated more easily than the developing device.US-A-5 132 729 discloses an image forming apparatus having
a processing cartridge detachably mounted on the body of
