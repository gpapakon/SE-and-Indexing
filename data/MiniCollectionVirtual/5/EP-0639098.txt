<ABSTRACT>
To avoid deposits on the restrictor that channels extractant into a collector (1901), a heated capillary tube (1900) pressure release restrictor has a thermally insulated outlet end in a collecting trap (1908) substantially colder than the capillary tube (1900). The restrictor is heated between the insulation (1906) and the capillary tube (1908) by Joulean heating. The solvent in the trap (1908) is at a pressure of 5 to 200 psi above atmospheric pressure. The thermal resistance of the insulation (1906) is selected to reduce the heat added to the extractant to a minimum, to keep the extractant from freezing, and to reduce partitioning of the extract and extractant. It has a thermal conductivity no greater than 60 BTU's per hour, per square foot, per inch for a one degree Fahrenheit difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to supercritical fluid
extraction.In supercritical fluid extraction, an
extraction vessel is held at a temperature above the
critical point and is supplied with fluid at a
pressure above the critical pressure. Under these
conditions, the fluid within the extraction vessel
is a supercritical fluid. In one type of apparatus
for supercritical extraction, there is a specially
constructed extraction vessel within a source of
heat.A prior art apparatus for supercritical
extraction of this type is described by B.W. Wright,
et. al., in ANAL.CHEM.59, 38-44 (January 1987)
using a glass-lined extraction chamber within a
bolted stainless steel extraction vessel heated in
an oven. This type of extraction apparatus has the
disadvantages of: (1) requiring time consuming
steps to open the pressurized extraction vessel
before use to insert the sample and again to open it
after use to remove the spent sample; and (2) under
some circumstances, requiring the handling of a hot
extraction vessel. Prior art apparatuses for automatically
changing samples are known. For example, Beckman
Instruments, Inc. has produced a radioimmuno and a
biogamma analyzer that incorporates a sample changer
with an elevator mechanism that raises sample vials
from a sample changer to a lead-shielded radiation
counting chamber above the sample chamber. Also, a
gamma series 300 unit manufactured by Beckman
Instruments, Inc., automatically interposes a thick
lead shutter that separates the sample vial and the
counting chamber from the environment outside the
counting chamber. These devices are described in
Beckman Bulletin 7250 dated approximately 1972 or
1973. Another apparatus was produced by Micromedic
Systems, a division of Rhom and Haas, called the
Micromedic Concept 4. It is described in Bulletin
M1515 dated 1976.Two patents describing systems of this type are
United States patent 3,257,561 to Packard et al
issued June 21, 1966, for RADIOACTIVITY LEVEL
DETECTING APPARATUS FOR SAMPLES CARRIED BY PORTABLE
TRAYS WITH TRANSFER AND INDEXING MEANS FOR THE TRAYS
and United States patent 3,198,948 to Olson issued
August 3, 1965, for APPARATUS FOR MEASURING ACTIVITY
LEVELS OF RADIOACTIVE SAMPLES. These devices are not suitable for handling the
high temperature, high pressure fluid systems
necessary for supercritical extraction.In collecting sample (analytes) during
supercritical extraction, a fluid flow restrictor is
included to maintain high pressure in an extraction
chamber while allowing a controlled flow rate
through the
