<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds and methods of treating
interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)
mediated diseases.Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are biological
substances produced by a variety of cells, such as monocytes or macrophages. IL-1
has been demonstrated to mediate a variety of biological activities thought to be
important in immunoregulation and other physiological conditions such as
inflammation [See, e.g., Dinarello et al., Rev. Infect. Disease,6, 51 (1984)]. The
myriad of known biological activities of IL-1 include the activation of T helper cells,
induction of fever, stimulation of prostaglandin or collagenase production, neutrophil
chemotaxis, induction of acute phase proteins and the suppression of plasma iron
levels.There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-1
production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease. These include
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other
acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction
induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease; tuberculosis, atherosclerosis,
muscle degeneration, cachexia, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid
arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, and acute synovitis. Recent
evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes and pancreatic B cells.Dinarello, J. Clinical Immunology, 5 (5), 287-297 (1985), reviews
the biological activities which have been attributed to IL-1. It should be noted that
some of these effects have been described by others as indirect effects of IL-1.Excessive or unregulated TNF production has been implicated in
mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis,
rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions; 
sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome,
adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary
inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption diseases,
reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due
to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy,
cachexia, secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC
(AIDS related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease,
ulcerative colitis, or pyresis.AIDS results from the infection of T
