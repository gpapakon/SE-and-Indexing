<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a phase-modulated interferometer for evaluating phase shifts on the basis of changes in optical path lengths in the measuring arm of the interferometer. The object of realising a phase-modulated interferometer which generates the sin-cos signals customary in length measuring systems and makes these available as a conventional interface, is achieved according to the invention by providing that in the case of sinusoidal control of the phase modulator (11) sine signals of the form sin[-(2n-1) omega t] and cos (2m  omega t), which are coupled in a phase-locked and frequency-locked fashion to the control signal of the phase modulator, are added separately and parallel to one another in each case to the split superimposed (heterodyne) signal from the reference arm (12) and the measuring arm (13), and the conventional quadrature signals are available at an interface (5) after filtering by means of two lowpass filters (51, 52). The invention is preferably used for precision length measuring systems on the basis of heterodyne evaluation.
