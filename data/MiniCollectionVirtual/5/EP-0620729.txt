<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the delayed delivery of an 
active agent. More particularly, it is related to osmotically-activated 
devices for dispensing active agents to a biological 
environment of use following an initial delay. Osmotic dispensing devices for delivery of therapeutically 
active agents are well known in the art. Such devices use an 
expansion means to deliver an agent to an environment of use over a 
period of hours, days or months. The expansion means absorbs liquid, 
expands, and acts to drive out beneficial agent formulation from the 
interior of the device in a controlled, usually constant manner. The 
osmotic expansion means is used to controllably, usually relatively 
slowly, and over a period of time, deliver the agent. Because they 
become activated as soon as they are placed in a fluid environment, 
these devices are not generally used to delay the initial release of 
the agent. Where osmotic technology has been used to provide an 
initial delay, the delay is followed by the rapid release, or 
substantially simultaneous introduction, of all of the agent or all 
of the dosage form(s) containing the agent into the environment of 
use at one time. This is not always an appropriate method of 
delivery, such as when delivery of an agent at a constant rate over a 
prolonged period of time is desired. The delay of the initial release of an agent has primarily been 
previously effected by coating the agent or a formulation containing 
the agent with a dissolvable or bioerodible coating layer, such as 
gelatin or an enteric coating, which coating layer dissolves or 
erodes in the environment of use to then make the agent available. 
Delayed initial release has also been provided by dispersing the 
agent in a dissolvable or erodible matrix. However, such systems are 
often unreliable and release cannot be controlled with great accuracy 
due to the variability and relatively uncontrollable nature of 
erosion and dissolution.  
 The prior art in EP-A-0384642 discloses a two-section capsule 
with one section containing a plug, an active material and a 
swellable material with the other section serving as a cap. The 
capsule opens by the plug moving to force the cap from the capsule. 
In US-A-4,976,966 a device is disclosed shaped like a tube consisting 
of an outer cover, a wicking layer, a semipermeable membrane, an 
intermediate osmotic layer and a flexible bag. The tube is closed by 
a fixed impermeable plug with a port therethrough. In US-A-4,643,731, 
a device is disclosed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fluid-imbibing delivery device (1; 2; 3) for 
dispensing an active agent to a fluid environment of use 

over a predetermined prolonged period of time after an 
initial, preset delayed startup of delivery, which device 

maintains its integrity in the fluid environment, wherein 
the device comprises: 


(a) a first housing (12) and a second housing (14), the 
first and second housings being in reversibly sliding 

telescoping arrangement with each other, the first 
housing being impermeable to fluid and having an end 

adapted to fit within the second housing and the second 
housing being semipermeable to fluid; 
(b) an active agent delivery chamber (16) within the 
first housing comprising 


(i) at least one active agent formulation (22), 
(ii) a first fluid-activated expansion means (20) for 
expelling the active agent formulation from the delivery 

device, 
(iii) an exit means (28), and 
(iv) a fluid-passage means (26); and 
(c) an expansion chamber (18) within the second housing, 
the expansion chamber comprising 


(i) a second fluid-activated expansion means (30) for 
separating apart the first and second housings, and  

 
ii) a push plate (32) adjacent the telescoping end of 
the first housing. 
A delivery device as claimed in claim 1 which 
further comprises a partition layer (24) between the 

active agent formulation and the first expansion means. 
A delivery device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 

wherein the active agent formulation is a liquid, a 
solid, a semi-solid, a thermoresponsive composition or 

a plurality of dosage forms (36; 38; 40; 42). 
A method for delivering an active agent to a fluid 
environment of use for a predetermined prolonged period 

of time after an initial delayed startup of delivery, the 
method comprising: 


(1) placing a fluid-imbibing delivery device (1; 2; 3) 
into the fluid environment, which device maintains its 

integrity in the fluid environment, wherein the delivery 
device comprises: 


(a) a first housing (12) and a second housing (14), the 
first and second housings being in reversibly sliding 

telescoping arrangement with each other, the first 
housing being impermeable to fluid and having an end 

adapted to fit within the second housing and the second 
housing being semipermeable to fluid;  

 
(b) an active agent delivery chamber (16) within the 
first housing comprising 


(i) at least one active agent formulation (22), 
(ii) a first fluid-activated expansion means (20) for 
expelling the active agent formulation from the delivery 

device, 
(iii) an exit means (28), and 
(iv) a fluid-passage means (26); and 
(c) an expansion chamber (18) within the second housing, 
the expansion chamber comprising 


(i) a second fluid-activated expansion means (30) for 
separating apart the first and second housings, and 
(ii) a push plate (32) adjacent the telescoping end of 
the first housing; 
(2) allowing fluid to be imbibed through at least a 
portion of the second housing of the delivery device for 

causing the second expansion means to expand and exert 
pressure onthe slidably connected first and second 

housings to push apart and separate the two housing to 
expose the fluid-passage means to the environment; and 
(3) allowing fluid to be imbibed through the fluid-passage 
means for causing the first expansion means to 

expand to push the active agent formulation from the 
delivery device. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 which further 
comprises a partition layer (24) between the active agent 

formulation and the first expansion means. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 wherein 
the active agent formulation is a liquid, a solid, a 

semi-solid, a thermoresponsive composition or a plurality 
of dosage forms (36; 38; 40; 42).
