<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat transfer
fluid (refrigerating machine oil) composition comprising
alkylmethylsiloxane fluids or mixtures of alkylmethylsiloxane
fluids. The invention further relates to the use
of alkylmethylsiloxane fluids in devices utilized for
cooling.The properties desirable in low-temperature heat
transfer fluids are stability to refrigerants, excellent
lubricating properties (i.e. anti-seizure and antiwear),
high heat capacity (i.e. specific heat) properties and an
ability to act as a coolant by exhibiting a low viscosity at
low temperatures. It is further desired that these low-temperature
fluids be capable of demonstrating a high
flashpoint while retaining a low viscosity at low
temperatures for ease of handling. A heat transfer fluid
having a high flashpoint while maintaining a low viscosity
at lower temperatures is even more crucial due to impending
legislation in many countries requiring hazardous labelling
on materials with closed-cup flashpoints of less than 140°F
(60°C).Heat transfer fluids are described in the art.
For example, halocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons;
aqueous solutions of alcohols such as-methanol, ethylene
glycol and propylene glycol; and aqueous solutions of salts
such as calcium chloride or soda have been used as low-viscosity
heat transfer fluids at low temperatures,
depending on the temperature range. The disadvantages of
these fluids are also well known. Lower alcohols require
elaborate safety precautions because of their toxicity and
low flashpoints. Aqueous salt solutions are highly
corrosive and have a high viscosity at low temperatures. 
Halocarbon and halogenated hydrocarbon compounds are
believed to be partly responsible for the photochemical
degradation of the ozone layer and in some instances are
also toxic. Thus, mixtures of these materials with silicone
oils suffer from the same disadvantages.The use of silicone oils in devices is not new.
For example, JP-A 63/289098 discloses a lubricating oil
which is compatible with Freon(R) that contains 2 weight
percent or more of modified silicone oil with a kinematic
viscosity at 40°C. of 10 to 50,000 mm2/s (centistokes). The
silicone oil is prepared by substituting part or all of the
methyl groups of a polydimethylsiloxane with groups selected
from at least two classes of (A) alkyl containing 2-40
carbon atoms, (B) aryl and (C) groups of the formula -R1,
-R2OH, -R2OR3 or -R2C(O)-O-R3, where R1 is alkylaryl or
aralkyl, R2 is selected from alkylene, arylene, alkylarylene
or aralkylene and R3
