<ABSTRACT>
A unit used for controlling and programming 
hot water installations that combines one single circuit 

or primary circuit for energy in the form of hot 
water with a series of substations (16) located outside 

each household (12), which has one microprocessor 
card (17) in the boiler room (22), another (18) in 

each substation and another in each household, which 
control and measure the different parameters inside 

the household.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to installations for distributing 
hot water in a closed circuit to be arranged 
in blocks of houses or offices as primary energy for 
different uses inside these places and more specifically 
to the arrangement of the different elements inside a 
module, a substation, in order to provide the different 
services. This closed circuit, which will henceforth be 
called primary circuit, consists of one or more boilers 
that provide the necessary heat to this circuit and of 
a series of units, one for each household or office, 
for the production and control of hot water for sanitary 
purposes, central heating, etc., which will henceforth 
be called substation, and which is fed by the primary 
circuit. Installations are already known which, to a certain 
extent, include some of the characteristics mentioned. 
However, they are limited in their operativity 
and in the control of the installation as a whole, 
taking into account the different components that make 
up the substations and the other items. One object of the present invention is to provide 
an installation composed of one single hydraulic circuit 
which allows energy to be provided, in the form of hot 
water, to each household or office for use in central 
heating, hot water, sanitary fittings and any other accessories 
where its use is needed, with total independence 
of the other users and the timetable of operation. Another object of the invention is an installation 
which uses a single meter to record the energy  
 
consumption of the user and helps to carry out a rational 
distribution of costs, by providing a breackdown of 
individual consumptions and overall consumptions common 
to all the households or offices. Another object of the invention is an installation 
with an individual control for the production temperature 
of sanitary hot water. Another object of the invention is to provide an 
installation provided with a system of microprocessors 
used for controlling temperatures and consumptions which 
allows each user, from the inside of each household, to 
control his consumptions of water and energy, to control 
the timetable of operation of each service, temperatures, 
etc., by means of a microprocessed card situated in each 
of the substations, passing all the data to a master-card 
located in the boiler room, which in turn controls the 
operation of the boilers. To achieve these objectives, the invention proposes 
an assembly made up of at least one boiler for producing 
the hot water, which is responsible for
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1.- Control and programming unit for hot water 
installations, of the type which have at least one boiler 

(1) for producing the said hot water, a number of 
substations (16), one for each household, each of which 

includes a heat interchanger (5), temperature sensors 
(6, 10), several valves, meters, etc., which is characterized 

by the combination of a single primary circuit 
for hot water, provided with a delivery pipe (3) towards 

each substation (16), a water intake from each of them 
towards the interior of each household and a return pipe 

(4) towards the boiler (1), with an electronic device 
composed of a master-card (17) located in the boiler 

room, another card (18) located in each of the substations 
and another card situated inside each household, 

in that the master-card (17) controls the variables in 
the boiler room and the card (18) in each substation 

controls the temperature parameters, valves, volumeters, 
etc., included in the substation, in that this card in 

the substation is connected with the one inside the 
household, which allows the said parameters to be set 

from inside the household, and in that the card in the 
substation transmits all the information to the master-card 

in the boiler room. 
2.- Control and programming unit for hot water 
installations, in accordance with claim 1, characterized 

in that the master-card (17) in the boiler room is 
connected with another card, from which programming of 

the master-card is carried out. 
3.- Control and programming unit for hot water 
 

installations, in accordance with claim 1, characterized 
in that the master-card (17) in the boiler room is 

connected to a computer (26) with a keyboard and this, 
in turn, to a remote control centre (28).
