<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for purifying 
contaminated industrial sewage water solutions or 

other aqueous solutions having a similar contaminant 
profile, normally containing ions of several metals 

and other elements such as As, Bi, Sb, P and Se, by 
precipitation in two stages and by returning the 

precipitate separated from the second precipitation 
stage to the first precipitation stage. Precipitation 

is effected in a first stage by adding lime in a 
surplus quantity, wherewith the major part of the 

contaminant content is precipitated. The formed precipitated 
is isolated and removed together with residual 

lime. Precipitation of remaining contaminant 
content is effected by adding a suitable reagent for 

precipitation at a pH in the range of 4-11, and formed 
precipitate is isolated and returned to the first 

precipitation stage, either directly or indirectly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for purifying 
contaminated industrial sewage water solutions or 
other aqueous solutions which have a similar contamination 
profile, normally comprising ions of several 
metals and other contaminating elements such as As, 
Bi, Sb, P and Se, comprising precipitating the contaminants 
in two stages and returning the precipitate 
isolated from the second stage to the first precipitation 
stage. Many known methods for purifying industrial sewage 
water are directed primarily to certain selected 
contaminants or impurities and are less effective in 
the case of other contaminants. These processes are 
often complicated or often contain stages which require 
the use of advanced and sensitive control equipment, 
for instance precipitation agent metering equipment 
or pH-regulating equipment. Because of their 
complexity, sensitivity and cost, such purification 
methods are only used to a limited extent, or are less 
effective than would be desired. Methods of the kind defined in the introduction are 
known from Boliden's earlier patent specifications, 
for instance from EP-B-O,139,622 and EP-B-0,364,423. 
A fundamental concept of both 
of these methods is that the major part of the precipitation 
reagent is added in the second stage under 
conditions in which a voluminous metal hydroxide-metal 
oxide precipitate is formed. This voluminous precipitate 
is separated and returned to the first precipitation 
stage and contains a substantial part of the 
contaminant content and is used as an auxiliary precipitation 
agent in the precipitation taking place in 
the first stage, from which there is taken a precipitate  
 
which includes essentially the entire contaminant 
content of the contaminated solution. According to 
EP-B-0,139,622, the contaminants removed are primarily 
As and/or P, wherein the precipitation process in the 
first stage is carried out in an alkaline environment 
to form an arsenic-containing and/or a phosphate-containing 
dumpable sludge. Publication EP-B-0,364,423 
relates to the purification of industrial waste solutions, 
for instance solutions that contain As, P and 
also heavy metals, wherein after adding the voluminous 
hydroxide precipitate taken from the second stage, 
purification in the first stage is effected by adding 
sulphide ions at a pH such as to dissolve the hydroxide 
precipitate. This results in the formation of a 
metal sulphide precipitate which can be conveniently 
worked-up with respect to its valuable metal content. These
