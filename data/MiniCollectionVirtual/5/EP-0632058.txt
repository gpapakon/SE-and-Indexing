<ABSTRACT>
A polymer scale preventive agent for use in polymerization 
of a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated double 

bond, comprising an alkaline solution containing (A) a 
condensation product having a molecular weight of 400 to 

50,000 obtained by condensing a quinone compound. This 
agent is applied to the inner wall surfaces of a 

polymerization vessel, and dried to form a coating. Such a 
vessel is effective in preventing polymer scale deposition, 

not only on the areas located in the liquid-phase region 
but also on the areas around the interface between the gas 

and liquid phases in the vessel, and useful in producing a 
polymer that shows few fish eyes and good whiteness when 

formed into sheets or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer scale
preventive agent for use in polymerization of a monomer
having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond, and a
process for producing a polymer using the same.Heretofore, methods for polymerization of a monomer
having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond have been
known, such as suspension, emulsion, solution, gas phase
and bulk polymerization processes. In any of
these polymerization processes, polymer scale is liable to
be deposited on the areas with which the monomer comes into
contact, such as inner walls and stirring equipment
of a polymerization vessel.The deposition of the polymer scale results in disadvantages
that the yield of the polymer and cooling capacity
of the polymerization vessel are lowered, and that the
polymer scale may peel off and mix into a polymeric product,
thereby impairing the quality of formed products obtained
by processing the polymeric product. In addition,
removal of deposited polymer scale is very laborious and
time-consuming. Further, the polymer scale contains unreacted
monomers and, therefore, may cause physical disorders
in the operators, which has been a very serious problem in 
recent years.For preventing polymer scale deposition on the polymerization
vessel inner wall, methods have been
known, for example, a method in which a polymer scale preventive
agent comprising a polar organic compound such as
amine compounds, quinone compounds, aldehyde compounds,
is applied to the polymerization vessel inner wall
to form a coating and a method in which such compounds
are added to an aqueous medium (Japanese Patent
Publication (KOKOKU) No. 45-30343, as practiced in some instances
of suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride.However, these methods have the disadvantage that,
although the polymer scale preventive effect is exhibited
while polymerization is repeated for up to 5 or 6
batches, the effect diminishes if the number of repeated
batches of polymerization exceeds 5 or 6 (that is, the
scale preventive effect is poor in durability). The disadvantage
is emphasized particularly where a water-soluble
catalyst is used for polymerization, and, in this point,
the polymer scale prevention according to these methods is
unsatisfactory industrially.For overcoming the above disadvantage, Japanese Pre-examination
Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 53-13689 proposes
a method in which the inner wall of a polymerization
vessel are coated with a polymer scale preventive
agent comprising a condensation product of an aromatic
amine
