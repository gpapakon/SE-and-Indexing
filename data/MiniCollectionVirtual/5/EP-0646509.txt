<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an anti-slip system for a work vehicle (10) which comprises at least one right-hand and one left-hand front wheel (14) and at least one right-hand and one left-hand rear wheel (14) and independently actuable brakes (40, 42, 44, 46) each assigned to one of the wheels (14). For an automatic system to increase the pulling power or slip resistance of a work vehicle which is used in conditions which militate against pulling power, the proposal is that each wheel (14) should be assigned at least one rotational-speed sensor (54, 56, 58, 60), the output signal of which is fed to a control unit (64, 66), and that the control unit (64, 66) should contain means for detecting wheel slip and, when a predeterminable wheel-slip value is exceeded, should output automatic control signals for the application of the brake (40, 42, 44, 46) assigned to the slipping wheel (14), irrespective of the control of the brakes (40, 42, 44, 46) at the other wheels (14). A bend-angle sensor (62) connected to the control unit (64, 66) is preferably provided, and the control unit (64, 66) has means for calculating a compensation factor CF using the bend-angle sensor signal, which is used in the calculation of slip. A work vehicle with an anti-slip system of this kind is also specified.
