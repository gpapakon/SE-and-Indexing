<DESCRIPTION>
NITROGEN CONTAINING HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS PHARMACEUTICALSThis invention relates to novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn- Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor, and that ICS 205-930, which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, acts as an antagonist at this receptor.WO 91/16045 (SmithKline and French Laboratories Limited) describes the use of cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias and stroke.EP-A-501322 (Giaxo Group Limited) describes indole derivatives having 5-HT4 antagonist activity.EP-A-309423 (Istituto de Angeli S.p.A) and EP-A-247266 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) describe 5-HT3 receptor antagonists derived from a benzimidazolone or indoline nucleus.A class of novel, structurally distinct compounds has now been discovered, which compounds include benzimidazolone derivatives. These compounds have 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:(l)wherein:X-I-X2 is NR2-CO or CR-j R2-CR3R4 where Rz and R-j to R4 are independently hydrogen or C-\ .Q alkyl; and/or 

R1/R2 and R3/R4 together are a bond and/or R1/R2/R3/R4 are joined to formC3.6 polymethylene; Ra is hydrogen, halo, C-i-e alkyl, amino, nitro or C-\.Q alkyl; R5 is hydrogen, halo, C1-5 alkyl or C-\.Q alkoxy; Y is O or NH; Z is of sub-formula (a), (b) or (c):(a)(b)(c)wherein n1 is 1 , 2, 3 or 4; n2 is 0, 1 , 2, 3 or 4; n3 is 2, 3, 4 or 5; q is 0, 1 , 2 or 3; p is 0, 1 or 2; m is 0, 1 or 2;R5 is hydrogen, C-|_12 alkyl, aralkyi or R5 is (CH2)z-Rlθ wherein z is 2 or 3 and R-io is selected from cyano, hydroxyl, C-j-β alkoxy, phenoxy, C(0)C-| .6 alkyl, COC6H5, -CONR-| \\~\\2. W\-\\ \ Q,0\~\^ 2, SO \\-\^ -| R-| 2 or NRf|S02Ri2 wherein R-J -J and R-12 are hydrogen or C-μe alkyl; andRg, R7 and RQ are independently hydrogen or C-j_6 alkyl; and Rg is hydrogen or C1-10 alkyl; or a compound of formula (I) wherein the CO-Y linkage is replaced by a heterocyclic bioisostere; having 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.Examples of alkyl or alkyl containing groups include C-j , C2, C3, C4, C^, CQ, C7, Cβ, Cg, C10. C-j 1 or C-j 2 branched, straight chained or cyclic alkyl, as 

appropriate. C1-4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n- and /so-propyl, n-, iso, sec- and tett-butyl.
