<ABSTRACT>
The under-roof construction serves for the fastening of different roofing panels on roofs which are insulated by rigid-foam panels. Fastened on the rafters are retaining angles (2) which serve for securing the laminated rigid-foam panels (5). In the region of the joint, separate batten head carriers (3) are fitted into the retaining angles. The batten head carriers (3) exhibit fastening parts for receiving batten head rails (4) at regular intervals from one another, i.e. in the direction of the eaves. A plurality of batten head rails may be fastened with respect to one another on a batten head carrier, with the result that a plurality of roofing panels may also be fastened with respect to one another with the aid of a retaining angle and of a batten head carrier. By using three parts (retaining angle (2), batten head carrier (3) and batten head rail (4)), universal usage, utilising standardised rigid-foam panels, is possible. There are relatively few joints, the number thereof being predetermined by the dimensions of the rigid-foam panels. The construction is stable since the corresponding sections of the batten head carriers overlap one another. The number of heat bridges or cold bridges caused by the joints is small. Mounting is simple and thus possible in a cost-effective manner. The resulting joints of the rigid-foam panels are closed, by the lamination of the upper side of the panels, by a corresponding, overlapping width and may even be adhesively bonded.

Underroof structure for roofs covered with roofing boards or the like, 
comprising holding angle members (2) fixed to the rafters or the like and on 

which rest lined rigid foam boards (5) with their profiled, laterally abutting 
edges bounding a gap (6) and in which the holding angle members (2) are used 

for fixing lath head rails (4) for the roofing boards, characterized in that 
the fixing of the lath head rails (4) to the holding angle members (2) takes 

place by means of separate lath head carriers (3) at right angles to the lath 
head rails (4) and which are hung in the holding angle members (2) in the 

vicinity of the gap (6) and that the lath head carriers (3) have fixing parts 
(7) for receiving lath head rails (4) at regular intervals perpendicular to 

the eaves, i.e. running in the roof pitch direction. 
Underroof structure according to claim 1, characterized in that the lath 
head carriers (3) have an angular structure, one leg (3c) projecting into the 

gap (6) and being connected to the holding angle member (2), whilst the other 
leg (3a) rests on the rigid foam board (5) connecting in the eaves direction. 
Underroof structure according to claim 2, characterized in that the leg 
(3a) of the lath head carrier (3) is slightly longer than the width of the 

rigid foam board on which it rests. 
Underroof structure according to claim 2, characterized in that the leg 
(3c, 3b) of the lath head carrier (3) located in the gap is angled to adapt 

to the profiling of the rigid foam board. 
Underroof structure according to one or more of the claims 2 to 4, characterized 
in that the leg (3a) of the lath head carrier (3) resting on the rigid 

foam board (5) has fish joints (7) for fixing the lath head rails (4) and into 
which the latter can be hung, the fish joint (7) having a spacing corresponding 

to the roofing board length perpendicular to the eaves, i.e. in the roof 
pitch direction. 
Underroof structure according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the lath head rails (4) in per se known manner are 

horseshoe-shaped in cross-section and have air passages (10) used for fixing 
to the lath head carriers (3).  

 
Underroof structure according to claim 6 and 7, characterized in that the 
air passages (10) can be hung in the fish joints (7) of the lath head carriers 

(3). 
Underroof structure according to one or more of the claims 5 to 7, characterized 
in that the lath head carrier (3) has one or more webs (8) at the end 

remote from the associated holding angle member (2) and said webs project 
into the air passage or passages (10) of the adjacent lath head rails (4). 
Underroof structure according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that on the part (2b) of the holding angle member (2) projecting 

upwards into the gap (6) there are openings (12) for receiving correspondingly 
constructed clips (9) on the lath head carriers (3) fixed there. 
Underroof structure according to one or more of the claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that on the part (2b) of the holding angle member (2) projecting 

upwards into the gap (6) is provided a slot for receiving a tongue on the lath 
head carriers (3) fixed there.
