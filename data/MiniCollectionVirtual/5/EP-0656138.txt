<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a process and device making it possible to determine the condition of one or more machines (3) at several measuring points by means of a measuring head (MK) with measurement transducers (MW) which can be releasably fitted there and to supply to a computer the relevant measurement signal together with the characteristic data therefor obtained at the measuring point concerned. The invention lies in the special nature of the obtaining of the characteristic data. For this purpose there are at each measuring point special coding elements (5) adjustable between two possible operating states which work together with an allocated contact device (K, K') in the attached measuring head (MK) and, depending on the set operating state, permanently affect it or leave it unaffected, from which a characteristic electric signal is generated in the measuring head (MK) for each contact device (K, K') which, depending on the operative position of the appropriate coding element (5), has one or other of two different possible values. The individual electric signals generated for each coding element are then fed into the computer in parallel or series as the characteristic signal of the relevant measuring point.

measuring head (MK), characteristic data is generated in

addition to the measurement data, which characterizes the
particular measuring site (MS) in a way distinguishable from
