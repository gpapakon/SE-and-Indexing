<ABSTRACT>
The cleaning apparatus comprises an arm (1) for 
removably holding a disk (5) for rotation thereon, a dust or flaw 

removing rotary member (2) having a cylindrical peripheral 
surface for being resiliently contacted with the surface of the 

disk (5), and a driving source (3) for rotating the rotary 
member (2). 
The cleaning apparatus removes flaws or dust on the 
surface of a disk to prevent poor reproduction of audio or video 

signals from the disk.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cleaning apparatus for removing flaws or dust, and
more particularly to cleaning apparatus for use for removing flaws or dust on the
surface of an optical disk such as a laser disk or a compact disk.Recently, optical disks such as laser disks or compact disks are used
universally as a recording medium for audio or video signals. When a disk is to be
stored or utilized, it is required to maintain the surface of the disk flat and to prevent
the surface of the disk from being damaged and prevent dust or some other foreign
articles from sticking to the surface of the disk.Accordingly, when it is tried to insert a disk such as a laser disk into an
accommodation case to store it or to set a disk in position into a deck for reproduction
to utilize it, not only the disk must not be bent or curved, but also it is necessary to
remove flaws formed on the surface of the disk and to remove dust sticking to the
surface of the disk.By the way, removal of flaws or dust on the surface of a disk such as a laser
disk is conventionally performed by manual operation using cloth or some other
suitable article. Since such operation requires much time and is cumbersome,
satisfactory removal of flaws and dust is not performed.If a disk is utilized while flaws remain on the surface thereof or dust remains
sticking to the surface thereof, then it sometimes occurs that information read once is
read again or information at a location is skipped and information at a next location is
read. As a result, audio or video signals reproduced are disordered, and in the worst
case reproduction itself becomes impossible. GB-A-1153367 discloses apparatus for cleaning a disc. The disc is supported
around its periphery by wheels, one of which is driven in order to rotate the disc.
Each side of the disc is cleaned by a cylindrical brush which is rotated about its
longitudinal axis which is aligned along a radius of the disc.According to the present invention, there is provided a cleaning apparatus
comprising:
an arm for removably holding a disk for rotation thereon;a dust or flaw removing rotary member having a generally cylindrical
peripheral surface for resiliently pressing against the surface of the disk; anda driving source for driving said rotary member to rotate around an axis of the
same;
   characterised in that said axis of rotation of said rotary member is arranged to
extend in the direction of a chord displaced from the center of the disk.Preferably, the arm is arranged to rock the disk in a direction

Cleaning apparatus comprising:

an arm (1) for removably holding a disk (5) for rotation thereon;
a dust or flaw removing rotary member (2) having a generally cylindrical
peripheral surface for resiliently pressing against the surface of the disk; and
a driving source (3) for driving said rotary member (2) to rotate around an
axis of the same;

   characterised in that said axis of rotation of said rotary member (2) is arranged
to extend in the direction of a chord displaced from the center of the disk (5).
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said arm (1) is arranged to
rock the disk (5) in a direction transverse to said axis of rotation of said rotary

member (2).
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said generally
cylindrical peripheral surface of said rotary member (2) is formed from fibers, and a

drive shaft (21) connected to said driving source (3) is removably fitted in an axial
core portion (22) of said rotary member (2).
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a plurality
of such rotary members (2) are disposed so as to resiliently press against both flat

faces of the disk (5).
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said arm (1) is mounted at a
base end thereof for pivotal rocking motion in a direction transverse to said axis of

rotation of said rotary member (2) and a holder (11) is rotatably mounted on a free
end of said arm for fitting into a central opening (5a) of the disk (5). 
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, further comprising
a polishing member positioned so as, in use, to be interposed between said generally

cylindrical peripheral surface of said rotary member (2) and the surface of the disk
(5).
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said rotary member (2) is
made of a polishing material.
Cleaning apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein a cam follower (64) is
provided on said arm (1) and is in contact with a rotatable cam (63) to rock said arm.
