<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing tapered block copolymers which are 
particularly useful for blend components in blends with polymers of 

styrene. In the first embodiment of this invention the copolymers are 
prepared in a polymerization process by sequentially charging: (1) an 

initiator and monovinylaromatic monomers in the presence of a 
randomizer; (2) an initiator and monovinylaromatic monomers; (3) a 

mixture of monovinylaromatic and conjugated diene monomers; and (4) a 
coupling agent; to produce a polymodal tapered block copolymer. In a 

second embodiment of the invention tapered block copolymers are prepared 
in a polymerization process by sequent
ially charging: (1) an initiator 
and monovinylaromatic monomers in the presence of a randomizer; (2) an 

initiator and monovinylaromatic monomers; (3) a mixture of 
monovinylaromatic and conjugated diene monomers; (4) a mixture of 

monovinylaromatic and conjugated diene monomers; and (5) a coupling 
agent; to produce a polymodal tapered block copolymer. The invention 

copolymers and blends of the invention copolymers with polymers of 
styrene are particularly useful for applications such as packaging and 

food or drink containers which require transparency, low blueness, 
colorlessness, good impact strength and ductility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tapered block copolymers of monovinylarenes and conjugated dienes and methods of
preparation of these tapered block copolymers.There has developed in the polymer field, and especially in the packaging and related industries, a need for thermoplastic
polymers that can be formed into colorless, transparent articles having good impact strength and ductility
There are needs for polymers which are useful as single components as well as for use in blends with other commonly
used polymers to make articles with improved properties. The polymers satisfying these needs should be suitable for
use with conventional extrusion, injection and blow molding equipment and also suitable for use in other methods of
forming plastics into containers, tubes, films, fibers, and the like. Polystyrene, high impact polystyrene, branched block
copolymers, and the like have been developed to meet these criteria with various degrees of satisfaction.Much effort has been directed to the preparation of substantially transparent block copolymer resins with a variety
of block structures produced by a variety of monomer addition sequences and a variety of coupling agents. Desirable
properties and an economic advantage can be obtained by blending some monovinylaromatic-conjugated diene copolymers
with polystyrene polymers. However, because blueness of blends of monovinylaromatic-conjugated diene
copolymers with polystyrene polymers cannot be predicted by rule of mixtures behaviors, getting a desirable combination
of properties can be a complicated task. Sometimes relatively colorless monovinylaromatic-conjugated diene
copolymers give blends with high blueness when blended with colorless general purpose polystyrene. Exemplary publications
in this field are US-A-4 167 545 and EP-A-0 512 530.Blueness of articles formed from various copolymers and blends of copolymers with other polymers is a longstanding
problem in applications where colorless materials which also have good impact strength and ductility are desirable.
Specific examples include materials for water and food containers.It is an object of this invention to provide resinous tapered block copolymers of vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons
and conjugated dienes from which can be made articles with low blueness and acceptable impact strength
and ductility.It is another object of this invention to provide resinous tapered block copolymers of vinyl-substituted aromatic
hydrocarbons and conjugated dienes suitable for use in blends with polymers of styrene.
