<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an ultra-thick thick film (30) 
of copper or silver or other suitable conductor 

material for use in spreading heat laterally, i.e., in 
the x and y directions, along a substrate (32). A 

substrate (32) of suitable thickness is chosen to 

dissipate heat in the vertical, i.e., z-direction, 
underneath a heat-generating component such as a 

semiconductor chip (26). The ultra-thick films (30) 
have a thickness ranging from about 50.8µm (2 mils) to 

about 127µm (5 mils) and are prepared from metal 
powders having average particles sizes ranging from 

about 1 micrometre to 3 micrometres.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to micro-electronic
devices containing heat-conductive films, and
particularly to heat-conductive films used for
heat-spreading and high current conduction as
specified in the preamble of claim 1, for example as
disclosed in US-A-5,121,298.A variety of methods are known for
dissipating heat in semi-conductor devices. An
existing method of heat dissipation employs a
beryllium oxide (BeO) substrate which has a very high
thermal conductivity. In addition, electrical
currents may also be conducted by a refractory
metallization and solder on the BeO substrate.
Disadvantages of such systems include relatively high
cost of manufacture, the toxic nature of BeO and
relatively high electrical resistance of the
refractory metallization. In fact, the use of BeO may
not be practical in near future due to anticipated
environmental regulation.Many thermal management methods for
semi-conductor applications are designed to dissipate
heat primarily in the vertical, termed the
'z-direction' underneath the heat-generating device.
For example, alumina substrates are often placed
underneath the heat-generating semi-conductor chips.
The alumina substrates dissipate heat in the vertical,
z-direction away from the heat-generating chip. Such
designs are limited in their ability to dissipate heat
laterally, i.e., in the x and y directions. This is
because the thermal conductivity of an alumina
substrate is low compared to metallic materials and
the cross-sectional area of the substrate (thickness)
available for conduction in the lateral direction is
smaller than the area available under the chip for 
thermal conduction in the z-direction. Systems
capable of dissipating heat also in the lateral
direction, i.e., the x and y directions, have an
advantage over systems capable of dissipating heat
only in the vertical, z-direction. Dissipation of
heat in the x and y directions is an advantage because
it provides low thermal resistance paths in addition
to the path directly under the heat-dissipating device
which results in an overall reduction in the thermal
resistance of the device.Many semi-conductor heat-dissipating systems
primarily use a large substrate or metal core for
dissipating heat. The use of thick films for
dissipating heat has not heretofore been seriously
considered. Conventional thick films have a thickness
in the range of about 12.7µm to 25.4µm (0.5 mil to 1.0
mil). It is conventional wisdom to optimise the
thickness of such films in the 12.7µm to 25.4µm (0.5
mil to 1.0 mil) range for the
