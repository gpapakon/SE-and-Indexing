<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a toggle-lever clamping device with a clamping head for car body construction work. Microswitches on a cover form a construction unit (board) interchangeable as a whole. The forming of special openings for accommodating limit switches or position transmitters is thus unnecessary. Assembly and dismantling can thereby be effected without problem and very quickly in the event of faults.

<CLAIMS>
Toggle-lever clamping device for car body construction with a clamping 
head (1), which incorporates on its front end two axially projecting housing 

sections (16, 17) with a gap (15) between them,
 
and with a cylinder (2) adjacent to the rear end of the clamping head (1) in the 

form of an axial extension, in which is located, with a suitable seal, a piston 
(5) such that it is movable longitudinally and alternately to both sides by 

pressure exerted by a pressure medium, in particular by pneumatic pressure, 
this piston reaching axially with its piston rod (6) through the cylinder (2) and 

a cavity in the clamping head (1), where on the free end of the piston rod (6), 
in the area of the gap (15), is fixed a toggle-lever arrangement (12) which is 

coupled to a clamping arm (13), with limit switches or position sensors in the 
form of microswitches (18, 19) which are integrated in the toggle-lever 

clamping device, 
characterized by the fact that
 the microswitches (18, 19) 
are adjustable in relation to one another and that the microswitches (18, 19) 

are arranged and fixed on microswitch mounting (20) forming a cover for the 
same as a modular unit which is replaceable as a whole in the form of a plate 

in the area of the gap (15) in axial direction of the clamping head (1), and that 
the microswitch mounting (20) is Tee-shaped in plan view, such that the head 

of the "Tee" incorporates a fixing rail (41) with a flush-mounting plug 
connector (33) for carrying electric leads (38) for the microswitches (18, 19), 

whilst the fixing rail (41) is adjoined by a plane mounting rail (21) running with 
its longitudinal axis (40) orthogonal to the longitudinal axis (24) of the fixing 

rail (41), which incorporates several parallel fixing holes (22, 23) spaced from 
one another in axial direction for axial adjustment and fixing of the 

microswitches (18, 19).  
 
Toggle lever arrangement in accordance with Claim 1,
characterized by the fact that
 the fixing rail (41) possesses a wall (28) 
angled orthogonally from the plane of the mounting rail (21), to which is 

adjoined the fixing rail (41), angled orthogonally, which for its part adjoins a 
further angled wall (29), orthogonal to it and parallel to the wall (28), which 

runs in the direction of the plane of the mounting rail (21) and projects past it 
downwards and that this wall (29) engages in the gap (15) of the spaced 

housing sections (16, 17) of the clamping head (1). 
Toggle-lever clamping device for car body construction with a 
clamping head (1) which on its front end incorporates two axially projecting 

housing sections (16, 17) arranged with a gap (15) from one another and with 
a cylinder (2) adjacent thereto as axial extension, in which is located, with a 

suitable seal, a piston (5) such that it is movable longitudinally and alternately 
to both sides by pressure exerted by a pressure medium, in particular by 

pneumatic pressure, this piston reaching axially with its piston rod (6) through 
the cylinder (2) and a cavity in the clamping head (1), where on the free end 

of the piston rod (6), in the area of the gap (15), is fixed a toggle-lever 
arrangement (12) which is coupled to a clamping arm (13) in the area of the 

gap (15), with limit switches or position sensors in the form of microswitches 
(18, 19) which are integrated in the toggle-lever clamping device (12), where 

the microswitches (18, 19) are adjustable in relation one another, and 

characterized by the fact that
 the microswitches (18, 19) are arranged and 
fixed on a microswitch mounting (20) forming a cover for them as a modular 

unit which is replaceable as a whole in the form of a plate in the area of the 
gap (15) in axial direction of the clamping head (1), and that the microswitch 

mounting (20) consists of a limb (34) which encompasses the clamping head 
(1) at the side, where a fixing strip (35) consisting of one piece of material 

adjoins this limb (34), which is fixed at the top by means of screws (36, 37) to 
the clamping head (1), where the fixing strip (35) incorporates a through-hole 

with a flush mounting plug connector (33) for electric leads (38) for the 
microswitches (18, 19) and that to the limb (34) is joined orthogonally an axial 

limb (39) projecting into the clamping head (1), which incorporates in axial  
 

direction and at intervals from one another several parallel fixing holes (22, 
23) with threads on which the microswitches (18, 19) are adjustably arranged 

in axial direction of the piston rod (6). 
Toggle-lever clamping device in accordance with Claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent Claims, 
characterized by the fact that
 the plate-shaped 
microswitch mounting (20, 34) is made of sheet metal by punching out or 

bending and its metal thickness is for example 2 mm. 
Toggle-lever clamping device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 3 

characterized by the fact that
 the microswitch mounting (20) consists of 
plastic. 
Toggle-lever clamping device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 3 or 5, 


characterized by the fact that
 the microswitch mounting (20) consists of a 
die casting.
