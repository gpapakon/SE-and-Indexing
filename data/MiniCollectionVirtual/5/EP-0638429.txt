<ABSTRACT>
Method for controlling a line head of a thermal printing apparatus, in which, to print a line of dots on a printing support, heating elements (2; 102) of the head (1; 101) are activated, in which method     - the positions of the heating elements (2; 102) to be activated are stored, - a predetermined number (N) is selected from these, with their positions being identified and stored, and is activated, - and, after deactivation, the preceding step is repeated for dots to be printed in positions not yet identified, this taking place - until all the dots of the line to be printed have been printed, before the printing support is advanced.   Use in facsimile machines.

Method of controlling the line head of a thermal printing apparatus, in which,
in order to print a line of dots on a printing medium, heating elements (2; 102) of the

head (1; 101) are activated, characterised by the fact that

the positions of the heating elements (2; 102) to be activated are memorised,
from these are selected, their positions being located and memorised, a
predetermined number (N) greater than the unit which are activated,
and, after deactivation, the previous step is repeated for dots to be printed of
positions not yet located, and this
until all the dots of the lines to be printed have been printed, before advancing the
printing medium.
Method according to claim 1, in which the heating elements (2; 102) are
grouped in blocks (112-115) of predetermined size and, if the number of heating

elements (2; 102) to be activated in one block is lower than said predetermined
number (N), before activation, further selection is made from the heating elements (2;

102) to be activated in another block (112-115).
Method according to one of claims 1 and 2, in which the heating elements (2;
102) are activated individually by a serial transfer of activation controls and, for

the heating elements (2; 102) which are to remain inactive, the individual controls
are forced into an inactive state before being transferred.
Thermal printing apparatus to carry out the method of claim 1, having a line
head (1; 101) comprising a plurality of heating elements (2; 102), a register (5; 105)

for controlling the activation of the heating elements (2; 102) and a transfer register
(10; 110) arranged to receive, from memorizing means (48; 148), activation control data 

and to transfer these data to the control register (5; 105), and sequencer means (51, 52,
151, 152, 153) for controlling the transfer register (10; 110) of the head (1; 101),

apparatus characterised by the fact that the sequencer means (51, 52; 151, 152, 153)
are arranged to count the number of heating elements (2; 102) whose activation is

controlled, to control means (54; 154) for memorizing the addresses of positions of said
heating elements (2; 102) and for checking the means for memorizing control data

(48; 148), and to inhibit the transfer register (10; 110) if said number exceeds a
threshold (N) higher than the unit.
Apparatus according to claim 4, in which the transfer register (110) is
arranged to transfer line portions of respective predetermined sizes and positions and,

where there is inhibition by the sequencer means (152, 153, 154), to transmit to the
control register (105) portions of white line.
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 and 5, in which a memory buffer (48,
148) is provided for memorizing activation control data relating to several lines.
