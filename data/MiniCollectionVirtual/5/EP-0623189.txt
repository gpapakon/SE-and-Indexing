<ABSTRACT>
An outer air seal assembly (44) cooled by a combination of impingement cooling and film cooling is disclosed. Various construction details are developed which provide impingement of cooling fluid on a radially outer side of an outer air seal assembly (44) and ejection of a film of cooling fluid over a radially inner surface (52) of the outer air seal assembly (44). In a particular embodiment, an outer air seal assembly (44) includes a substrate (54), an apertured cover (56) disposed outward of the substrate (54), and a layer of abradable material (58) extending radially inward of the substrate (54) and defining a flow surface (52). Cooling fluid is directed through the apertures (72), into a cavity (66), and impinges upon the outer surface of the substrate (54). A plurality of film cooling holes (76) extend through the substrate (54) and abradable layer (58) and provide fluid communication between the cavity (66) and flowpath (14). The cooling holes (76) are oriented to eject cooling in a film over the flow surface (52). In another embodiment, the cavity (66) includes a longitudinally extending chamber (112) disposed in an enlarged portion (108) of the air seal (46) to enhance cooling thereof and reduce stresses therewithin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an outer air seal assembly for a turbomachine 
according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. Such assembly is 
known from GB-A-2 169 037. A typical turbomachine such as an axial flow gas turbine engine has an 
annular flowpath for conducting working fluid sequentially through a 
compressor section, a combustion section, and a turbine section. The 
compressor section includes a plurality of rotating blades which add 
energy to the working fluid. The working fluid exits the compressor 
section and enters the combustion section. Fuel is mixed with the 
compressed working fluid and the mixture is ignited to add more energy 
to the working fluid. The resulting products of combustion are then 
expanded through the turbine section. The turbine section includes 
another plurality of rotating blades which extract energy from the 
expanding fluid. A portion of this extracted energy is transferred back to 
the compressor section via a rotor shaft interconnecting the compressor 
section and turbine section. The remainder of the energy extracted may 
be used for other functions.  
 The work output of the gas turbine engine is 
dependant upon many factors. Among these factors is the 
heat generated during the combustion process. The amount 
of heat generation is controlled by the fuels used and 
the fuel/air ratio but is limited by the allowable 
temperature within the turbine section. In modern gas 
turbine engines, working fluid temperatures beyond the 
melting temperature of the turbine materials are achieved 
by directing cooling fluid to the turbine section. 
Typically this cooling fluid is comprised of a portion of 
working fluid that exits the compressor section and 
bypasses the combustion process. Another factor related to the work output is the 
efficiency of the energy transfer between the products of 
combustion and the turbine rotor blades. The turbine 
section includes arrays of aerodynamically shaped vanes 
upstream of each array of rotor blades to optimize the 
orientation of the working fluid prior to engagement with 
the rotor blades. The turbine rotor blades have airfoil 
portions aerodynamically shaped to efficiently engage the 
working fluid. The rotor blade includes a platform to 
provide a radially inner flow surface and the turbine 
section includes an outer air seal assembly to provide a 
radially outer flow surface. The combination of these 
two flow surfaces confine the flow of working fluid to 
the airfoil portion of the rotor blade. The outer air seal
