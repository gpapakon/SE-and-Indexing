<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of this invention is a roller shutter profile or profile element, of which the connection to the neighbouring profiles (1) and/or to one another takes place with the aid of soft hinges (2), the borders of the profile (1) or the border elements being provided with a connecting means which engages into the corresponding border of the neighbouring profile or profile element (1). Said profile or profile element is characterised in that at the location of the soft-hinge connection (2), in each operating and guiding position during actuation, that is to say in the case of straight alignment of the profiles or profile elements (1) or in the case of angular displacement of the profiles or profile elements (1), said profile or profile element is provided with an articulation covering means (4).

Tambour door profile or profile element (1) that can be connected to adjacent
profiles or profile elements (1) by means of soft hinges (2), the edges of the

profiles or profile elements (1) having a connecting element (3) which engages in
the corresponding edge of the adjacent profile or profile element (1), the

connecting element (3) comprising female sections (3') and male sections (3"),
characterised in that the soft hinge (2) is covered at all times and in all positions

by a hinge cover (4) consisting of two parts (5, 6), and in that the soft hinge (2) is
moulded onto and forms a single piece with the adjacent profiles or profile

elements (1) on one side and the two sections (3', 3") of the connecting element
(3) on the other side.
Tambour door profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that part (6) of the
hinge cover (4) is in the form of a bent lip which fits into the rebate (7) delimited

by part (5) of the hinge cover (4).
Tambour door profile according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that part (6)
of the hinge cover (4) is offset in relation to the outside of the profile (1),

preferably by an amount equivalent to the thickness of the corresponding edge of
part (5).
Tambour door profile according to Claims 1, 2 and 3, characterised in the free
end of part (6) of the hinge cover (4) has an edge (6') with an additional curved

lip or sloped form.
Tambour door profile according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that part (6)
has a raised portion (8) at the point where it joins profile (1), the upper face of the

raised portion (8) being offset in relation to the upper face of the profile (1) by an
amount equivalent to the thickness of the edge of part (5) of the adjacent

profile (1). 
Tambour door profile according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that parts

(5, 6) of the hinge cover (4) are in the form of two bent lips, part (5) being joined
to the edge of one of the profiles (1) and flush with its upper surface, and the

other part (6) being joined to the corresponding edge of the adjacent profile (1)
and offset in relation to its upper surface by an amount which is at least

equivalent to the thickness of the edge of part (5), and having a raised portion (8)
at the point of the join.
Tambour door profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that the connecting
element (3) consists of a female section (3') and a male section (3"), and in that

the male section (3") is rigidly joined to the lower edge of one of the profiles (1)
and the female section (3') is joined to the lower edge of the adjacent profile (1)

by means of the soft hinge (2).
Tambour door according to Claim 1, characterised in that the profiles (1) have
tubular or open cross-sections, the parts (5, 6) of the hinge cover (4) being

moulded into or onto the sides of the profile (1) which also accommodate the
connecting element (3) and/or the soft hinge (2).
