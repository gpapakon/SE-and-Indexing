<ABSTRACT>
A low loss fiber optic coupler (31) of the type wherein a 
plurality of single-mode optical fibers (19,20) are fused together 

along a portion of the lengths thereof to form a coupling 
region (27). Each fiber (19,20) includes a core (20a) and a 

cladding (20b), the 
lowest refractive index of the fiber claddings (20b) being n₂. 

Each of the output fibers (20) of the coupler (31) further includes a 
surface region (20c) of refractive index n₄ that inhibits the 

coupling of light to lossy composite modes, n₄ being lower 
than n₂.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to single-mode fiber optic
couplers that are capable of coupling light between fibers
with low excess loss.Fused fiber couplers have been formed by positioning a
plurality of fibers in a side-by-side relationship along a
suitable length thereof and fusing and tapering the
claddings together to secure the fibers and reduce the
spacings between the cores. Various coupler properties
can be improved by forming an "overclad coupler" in which
the fibers are embedded in a glass matrix. An overclad
coupler is formed by inserting a plurality of optical
fibers into a glass tube and collapsing the tube midregion
onto the fibers. The central portion of the midregion is
thereafter drawn down to that diameter and coupling length
which is necessary to obtain the desired coupling. The
refractive index n3 of the inner region of the tube adjacent
the fibers must be lower than the refractive index n2 of the
fiber cladding. Commercially available single-mode optical
fibers usually have a value of n2 that is equal to or near
that of silica. If silica is employed as the base glass
for the tube, a dopant such as B2O3, and optionally
fluorine, is added thereto for the purpose of decreasing
the tube refractive index n3 to a value lower than n2.When the tube collapses onto the fibers, the fibers
are distorted so that their cross-sectional shape is no 
longer round. Although some amount of distortion always
occurs, the degree to which the fibers are distorted
depends upon the relative viscosities of the fibers and the
tube at the temperature of the tube collapse step as well
as upon the temperature profile of the preform, the vacuum
level during the collapse step and the glass geometry. The
coupler function may dictate the refractive index and thus
the hardness of the tube glass. For example, European
application EP0578982 teaches an overclad
achromatic fiber optic coupler of the type wherein a
plurality of single-mode optical fibers are fused together
along a portion of their lengths to form a coupling region
that is surrounded by a matrix glass body of refractive
index n3. The coupler taper and n3 are such that the
coupling constants of the coupler at two widely separated
wavelengths are identical, thus giving achromatic
performance. The value of Δ2-3 is preferably chosen so that
nonadiabatic taper excess loss is kept below 0.5 dB. A
discussion of nonadiabatic taper devices appears in the
publication, W.J. Stewart et al., "Design Limitation on
Tapers and Couplers in Single-Mode Fibers", Proc. IOPOC,
1985,
