<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of paper, an initial stock (AS) is prepared to make a final stock (ES) in a process comprising a plurality of preparation stages (ABS1, ..., ABS3) in aqueous suspension, using process waters (PW1, ..., PW3) and process chemicals (PC1, ..., PC3) and subsequently further processed in a paper machine, a part of the water being removed, in at least one of the preparation stages (ABS1, ..., ABS3) by means of a thickening stage (EDS1, ..., EDS3) arranged at the exit of the preparation stage, and being fed back to the entry of the same preparation stage as process water (PW1, ..., PW3), while forming a separate process water circulation (PWK1, ..., PWK3). In such a process, a reduction of the water demand and a simultaneous saving of process chemicals is achieved, along with optimal process control in the individual process stages, by removing interfering materials from the process water in the return of this process water circulation by means of selective flotation without the addition of chemical flocculants, exclusively by means of the injection of a gas containing oxygen.
