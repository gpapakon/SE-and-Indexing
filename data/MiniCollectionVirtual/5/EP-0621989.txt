<ABSTRACT>
A splice case for a telecommunication cable splice (1) comprises first and second parts (2 and 12) that are held together by springs (3) that function also to deform surfaces of the parts to put a sealing material (10) therein under compression. The splice case may contain a conductor organizer (18) and strain relief (8) at the cable entry/exit position.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SP L IC E CASETechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a splice case for encapsulating conductors, particularly in a telephone system, and is especially suitable for buried or other outdoor use. More specifically, the invention relates to improvements in US Patent 4,859,809. The complete disclosure of US 4,859,809 is completely incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.Background of the InventionIt is frequently necessary to protect conductor splices from the environment in order that they may continue to function properly for a life-time that may extend to several tens of years. Thus, the splice may be encapsulated by some means, preferably in a fashion that allows easy access to the splice (known as re-entry) for repair or rearrangement of conductors without destroying the original encapsulation.The US 4,859,809 patent covered a splice case for sealing a conductor splice comprising a splice case for encapsulating a conductor splice, which comprises a first hollow part; a second part that can be positioned adjacent the first part such that the first and second parts together define an enclosed space; a sealing material having a cone penetration value from 100-350 (10_ 1mm) and an ultimate elongation of at least 200%, the sealing material being within the first hollow part; and a spring for forcing the first and second parts together thereby putting the sealing material under compression; the first part and/or the second part having a deformable surface, and the spring being so shaped as to cause said surface to be deformed towards the sealing material thereby putting the sealing material under compression .The patent also covered a splice case comprising a splice case for encapsulating a conductor splice, which comprises a first hollow part; a second part that can be positioned adjacent 

 the first part, such that the first or second parts together define an enclosed space; a second material having a cone penetration value from 100-350 (lO^mm) and an ultimate elongation of at least 200%, the sealing material being within the first hollow part; and a spring for forcing the first and second parts together thereby putting the sealing material under compression, the spring comprising a resiKent elongate member shaped as at least three interconnected segments each segment being of reÂ¬ entrant shape and comprising a first portion that can bear against a surface of the first part, a second portion that can bear against a surface of the second part, and a third portion that interconnects the

What is claimed is:
1. A splice case for encapsulating a plurality of cables, which comprises:
a first hollow part;
a second part that can be positioned adjacent the first part such that the first and second parts together define an enclosed space.said first and second parts having access ports for cables in the sides perpendicular to a major surface; the access ports projecting outwardly from the splice case side wall along the axis of the cable entry/exit position and interacting with its opposite member to provide a substantially circular cross-section, elongate substantially tubular member for strain relief of the cable and sealing of the cable at the splice case entry/ exit.
a sealing material having a cone penetration value from 100 to 350 (lO^mm) and an ultimate elongation of at least 200%, the sealing material being within the first hollow part; and
a spring for forcing the first and second parts together thereby putting the sealing material under compression, when the spring engages the first and second parts, said spring permitting cables to be placed within the enclosure between the portions of the spring shape bearing against the sides of the case substantially perpendicular to the major surface;
the first part and/or the second part having a deformable major surface, and the spring being so shaped as to cause 


 said major surface to be deformed towards the sealing material thereby putting the sealing material under compression when the spring engages the first and second parts.
2. A splice case according to claim 1, in which the spring comprises a plurality of segments each of which can bear against a different part of said surface thereby distributing a compressive force on the sealing material and in which said surface has a line of weakness facilitating said deformation.
3. A splice case according any proceeding claim further including cable blocking between adjacent cables, said cable blocking overlapping the edges of the enclosure formed by the mating of the first and second parts.
4. A splice case according to any proceeding claim further including a sealing material in the second hollow part and the splice case projecting access parts are "C" or "U" shaped in cross-section and, form the substantially tubular strain relief member upon assembly of the splice case first and second parts.
5. A splice case according to any preceeding claim further including cable blocking between adjacent cables, said cable blocking overlapping the edges of the enclosure formed by the mating of the first and second parts.
6. A splice case for encapsulating a conductor splice, which comprises: 


 a first hollow part having a straight edge base capable of accepting a plurality of cables and a substantially circular periphery connecting the edges of the base.
a second part that can be positioned within the first part, such that the first or second parts together define an enclosed space;
a sealing material having a cone penetration value from 100-350 (lO-
i
mm) and an ultimate elongation of at least 200%, the sealing material being within the first hollow part; and
a spring for forcing the first and second parts together thereby putting the sealing material under compression, the spring comprising a resilient elongate member shaped as at least three interconnected segments each segment being of re-entrant shape and comprising a first portion that can bear against a surface of the first part, a second portion that can bear against a surface of the second part, and a third portion that interconnects the first and second portions.
7. A splice case according to Claim 6 wherein the first part and/or the second part have a deformable surface region centrally located therein and include the sealing material in the second hollow part.
8. A splice case according to Claim 6-7 further including at least one cable blocking between adjacent cables, said cable blocking overlapping the edges of the enclosure formed by the mating of the first and second parts. 


9. A splice case according to Claims 6-8 wherein the first and second hollow parts have a "C" or "D" shape and optionally further including openings within the periphery adjacent the base to accept additional cables.
10. A splice case according to Claims 6-9 wherein the openings for the cables in the edges of the first and second parts have a "C" or "U" shape and together form a substantially circular shape and optionally project from the sidewall to form a substantially tubular strain relief member at the cable entry/exit positions.
