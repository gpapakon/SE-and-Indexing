Dismantlable medical instrument, in particular a high-frequency
surgical instrument comprising a central working rod (11), at the

front end of which there is provided at least one working tool (25), a
guide tube (12) surrounding the working rod (11), the guide tube

(12) being axially displaceable within a certain range of distance
relative to the working rod (11) for the actuation of the at least one

working tool (25) and a handle (14) receiving the working rod (11)
and the guide tube (12), with the handle (14), the working rod (11)

and the guide tube (12) being made separable from one another,
characterized in that the rear ends of the working rod (11) and of the

guide tube (12) are arranged within the handle (14), in that the
working rod (11) is releasably secured inside the handle (14), in

that, in the region ahead of the position where the working rod (11)
is releasably secured, the rear end region of the guide tube (12) is

arranged in a guide sleeve (20) movably mounted at the handle (14)
and is releasably connected to the guide sleeve (20); and in that the

connection between the guide tube (12) and the guide sleeve (20)
can be released from the outside.
Instrument in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
central working rod (11) is formed as an electrode tube.
Instrument in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that at
least one working tool (25) is formed as a working electrode. 
Instrument in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that connections for the supply of the working tool (25), in

particular one or more high-frequency voltage connections (22), are
provided at the rear end of the central working rod (11).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the guide tube (12) coaxially surrounds the working

rod (11).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that an outer tube (13) is provided which preferably coaxially

surrounds the guide tube (12).
Instrument in accordance with claim 6, characterized in that the
outer tube (13) is received by the handle (14).
Instrument in accordance with claim 6 or 7, characterized in that
the outer tube (13) is designed to be separable from the handle (14),

from the working rod (11) and/or from the guide tube (12).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the working rod (11), the guide tube (12), and optionally

the outer tube (13) can be drawn off axially from one another
and from the handle (14).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that the working rod (11), the guide tube (12) and optionally 
the outer tube (13) with the handle (14) are releasably connected

by latch connections and/or lock connections and/or snap
connections (16, 26; 20, 24; 27, 28).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the working rod (11), the guide tube (12) and optionally

the outer tube (13) can be axially inserted onto and/or into a
handle (14) of tubular design.
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the working rod (11) has at least one radial recess, in

particular a ring groove (26), at its rear end region located in the
handle (14), with a coupling lock member (16), which is transversely,

displaceably journalled at the handle (14), can be actuated
from the outside engaging into the recess, with the engagement

preferably being such that the existing rotatability of the working
rod (11) about its axis is cancelled.
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the guide sleeve (20) is axially displaceably and/or

rotatably mounted at the handle (14).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the connection between the guide tube (12) and the

guide sleeve (20) can be released from the outside by axial displacement
and/or rotation of the guide sleeve (20). 
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that latch tongues (24) at the end of the guide tube (20)

and standing in axial engagement with the guide tube (20) pass axially
through the guide tube (20) and can be displaced radially inwardly

and thus brought out of engagement with the guide sleeve
(20) by axial displacement of the guide sleeve (20) to the rear against

a cam track feed relative to the handle (14).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the guide sleeve (20) is biased resiliently forwardly

against an abutment (30).
Instrument in accordance with one of the claims 13 to 16, characterized
in that a first axial displacement region (a) is provided for the

guide sleeve (20) and the guide tube (12) and serves for a relative
axial displacement between the working rod (11) and the guide tube

(12), and in that a second displacement region adjoins it to the rear,
which serves for the release of the connection between the guide

tube (12) and the guide sleeve (20).
Instrument in accordance with claim 17, characterized in that a
catch (17) releasable from the outside is provided at the end of the

first displacement region (a), and in that the guide sleeve (20) can
first pass through the second displacement range after removal of

the catch (17). 
Instrument in accordance with one of the claims 6 to 18, characterized
in that the outer tube (13) can be releasably pushed onto the

front end of the handle (14) and can be fixed there.
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the working tool or the working tools, in particular

working electrodes (25) are resiliently biased to be able to spread
away from each other and are pressed together to a greater or lesser

degree against the bias by the front inner edge (45, 46) of the axially
displaceable guide tube (12) depending on the axial portion of the

guide tube (12).
Instrument in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the working rod (11) is designed axially hollow and in

that supply lines for the working tools (25) are provided through the
axial hollow cavity.
