<ABSTRACT>
The circuit components (1, 2), which are to be protected, of an electrotechnical apparatus are surrounded by a module-type protecting device. The protecting device contains two plates (4, 5), the component sides of which face each other. Contact areas (6) are provided on the component sides. Each contact area (6) of one plate (4) is opposite a contact area (6) of the other plate (5). The contact area pairs which are thus formed are arranged close together, and surround the circuit components (1, 2) to be protected in the form of a ring. A plate material (8) is inserted between the contact areas (6) of the contact area pairs, and has through-contacts (9) which connect the contact areas (6) of each contact area pair electrically. Tracks (7), which each run across plate surfaces which externally screen the plate surfaces which face each other, are connected to each other by the contact area pairs in such a way that a serial or serial-parallel circuit of tracks (7) surrounds the circuit components (1, 2, 3) to be protected. The serial or serial-parallel circuit is connected to an evaluation circuit (3).

Protection device for circuit parts (1, 2) and/or
data of an electrotechnical apparatus, in which


the circuit parts (1, 2) to be protected are
arranged between two plates (4, 5),
contact regions (6) are arranged on the
mutually facing areas of the two plates (4, 5),

which contact regions are connected to end
points of conductor tracks (7) which each run

transversely over the two plates (4, 5), these
conductor tracks (7) screening the mutually

facing areas of the two plates (4, 5) from the
outside,
in each case two mutually opposite contact
regions (6) associated with different plates

(4, 5) respectively form a contact region pair
and a plurality of contact region pairs are

arranged annularly around the circuit parts
(1, 2) to be protected;
plate material (8) is inserted between the
plates (4, 5) in the region of the contact

regions (6),

in which plate material plated-through holes
(9) are provided, whose ends are connected to

contact areas (10) which are in each case
opposite a contact region (6) of a contact

region pair, and
which plate material has a perforation in the
region of the circuit parts (1, 2) to be

protected,
a liquefiable contact means (11) can in each
case be introduced between contact region (6)

and contact area (10), and
the conductor tracks (7) applied on the plate
areas connect the contact regions (6) to one

another in such a way that each conductor track
(7) of one plate (4, 5) is connected in series 

with at least one conductor track (7) of the
other plate (4, 5) and a plurality of series-connected

conductor tracks can be connected in
parallel, and each series or series/parallel

circuit is connected to an evaluation circuit
(3).
Protection device according to Claim 1, in which
the contact regions (6) surround the circuit parts

(1, 2) to be protected in at least two rings, the
contact regions (6) assigned to different rings

being arranged offset with respect to one another.
Protection device according to either of Claims 1
and 2, in which the inserted plate material,

comprises a multilayer plate whose area is so
large that it projects beyond the areas of the

plates (4, 5) at least on one side.
Protection device according to one of Claims 1 to
3, in which


the plates (4, 5) are of multilayer design, and
the conductor tracks (7) run closely adjacent
to one another, in a meandering form over the

respective plate (4, 5).
Protection device according to one of Claims 1 to
4, in which


the circuit parts (1, 2) to be protected and
the evaluation circuit (3) are arranged on a

component side of at least one of the plates
(4, 5);
the component sides of the plates (4, 5) face
one another and;
the conductor tracks (7) whose end points are
connected to a respective contact region (6)

run in a layer of the plates (4, 5) which is
not visible from the outside.
Protection device according to one of Claims 1 to
5, in which at least one of the plates (4, 5)

comprises a plurality of ceramic layers.
Protection device according to one of Claims 1 to
6, in which, in the plate material (8) inserted

between the contact regions (6), conductor tracks
(12) are provided which run transversely with

respect to the plated-through holes (9) and extend
from the circuit parts (1, 2) to be protected to

the outside, by means of which conductor tracks
the circuit parts (1, 2) to be protected can be

connected to the periphery.
