<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a combination of a compound of the
camptothecin analog class and a platinum coordination compound in the
manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in a human
afflicted therewith and for administering to such human an effective tumour cell
growth inhibiting amount of the combination. The invention also relates to a
pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the camptothecin analog
class and a platinum coordination compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier or diluent.Cisplatin, or cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum II, is a platinum coordination
compound which has been used successfully for many years as a
chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumors.
More recently, other diamino-platinum complexes have also shown efficacy as
chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various human solid malignant
tumors. Such diamino-platinum complexes include, but are not limited to,
spiroplatinum and carboplatinum.Although cisplatin and other diamino-platinum complexes have been
widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically
effective in all patients or against all types of solid tumors. Moreover, such
compounds have to be delivered at high dosage levels which can lead to toxicity
problems such as kidney damage.Compounds of the camptothecin analog class, such as topotecan, are
specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I. Topoisomerases are enzymes that are
capable of altering DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for
important cellular functions and cell proliferation. There are two classes of
topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, type I and type II. Topoisomerase I is a
monomeric enzyme of approximately 100,000 molecular weight. The enzyme
binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double
helix (or allows it to unwind), and subsequently reseals the break before
dissociating from the DNA strand. Topotecan has recently shown clinical
efficacy as the sole chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of humans afflicted
with ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer or non-small cell lung carcinoma. Cancer Chemotherapy Reports, Vol. 59, No. 3, (1975), pages 665-73;
Cancer Treatment Reports, Vol. 60, No. 11, (1976), pages 1619-25, and Int. J.
Cancer, Vol. 50, (1992), pages 604-10 describe various combinations of platinum
coordination compounds and compounds of the camptothecin analog class.There is a need for increasing the efficacy of the tumor cell
