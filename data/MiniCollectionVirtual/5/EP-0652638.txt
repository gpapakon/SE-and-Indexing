<ABSTRACT>
In a D.C. restoration circuit for a digital FM radio receiver, in which 
demodulated signals may be presented at the output of the demodulator as low-level 

differential signals superimposed on a variable D.C. level, the differential signal 
paths are capacitively coupled to the inputs of a comparator, and the voltage 

excursions at these inputs are clamped when the voltage between the inputs exceeds 
a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to D.C. restoration circuits for use, for example, in
digital radio receivers.According to the present invention a D.C. restoration circuit for digital data
signals appearing differentially between first and second input lines, which data signals
may be superimposed on a variable D.C. level, comprising first and second series
capacitors connected respectively between said first and second input lines and first and
second output lines, and first and second clamping transistors connected respectively to
said first and second output lines, is characterised in that there are provided first and
second differential amplifiers each responsive to the differential voltage between said
first and second output lines to forward bias a respective one of said first and second
clamping transistors when said differential voltage exceeds a predetermined value in a
respective sense.The first and second clamping transistors may be junction transistors having their
emitter-collector paths connected between said first and second output lines.Alternatively the first and second clamping transistors may be junction
transistors having their emitter-collector paths connected between respective ones of
said first and second output lines and respective ones of the voltage supply lines of
the D.C. restoration circuit.A D.C. restoration circuit in accordance with the invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:-
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the operation of known D.C.-coupled and A.C.-coupled 
data circuits respectively,Figure 3 shows a basic diode clamping circuit,Figure 4 shows a D.C. restoration circuit in accordance with the invention,
andFigure 5 shows in simplified form an alternative D.C. restoration circuit in
accordance with the invention.Referring to the drawings, in a digital system such as a digital radio, data may
exist as a low level signal superimposed on a variable DC level. Such a situation will
occur at the output of a quadrature demodulator in a digital FM radio where ideally the
demodulator output would be DC coupled to a comparator which would slice the
analogue output at the centre of its swing to provide maximum noise immunity and
minimum pulse stretching. Because of inevitable frequency errors between the
transmitter and receiver the DC level at the output of the demodulator will be unknown
since the demodulator has a frequency response to DC. This DC error would cause the
comparator to slice the data away from centre, reducing the noise
