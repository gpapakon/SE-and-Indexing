<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive type vertical grain milling 
machine comprises a perforated cylindrical body having 

at least one perforated arcuate plate member (46) which is 
formed therein with both a first group (41A) of elongated 

bran-removing holes serving to lead grain to be milled 
in a direction from an inlet side toward an outlet side 

of a grain milling chamber when the grain is rotated in 
the direction of rotation of a grain milling roll 

assembly within the grain milling chamber and a second 
group (41B) of elongated bran-removing holes serving to lead 

the grain to be milled in a direction from the outlet 
side toward the inlet side of the grain milling chamber 

when the grain is rotated in the direction of rotation 
of the grain milling roll assembly within the grain 

milling chamber, and therefore, grain can be milled 
highly efficiently and the progress of breakage of 

grains caused at the time of grain milling can be

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vertical
grain milling machine in which grain to be milled is
introduced into a cylindrical grain milling chamber from
vertical one end of the grain milling chamber and grain
having been milled is discharged from the other end of
the same, and more particularly, to an abrasive type
vertical grain milling machine of the type that
comprises a abrasive roll assembly mounted on a main
shaft extending straight in the vertical direction and a
perforated or porous cylindrical body or cylindirical
screen extending vertically around the roll assembly
leaving a space therefrom so as to form the cylindrical
grain milling chamber around the roll assembly in
cooperation with an outer peripheral surface of the roll
assembly and having a large number of bran-removing
holes or perforations through which bran produced in the
grain milling chamber is allowed to be released so that
the grain to be milled is introduced into the grain
milling chamber from vertical one end of the grain
milling chamber and the grain having been milled is
discharged from the other end of the same. The
invention especially relates to the bran-removing
perforated or porous cylindrical body of the abrasive
type vertical grain milling machine. It is noted that grain to be milled is not
limited to rice grain but may be other cereal grain such
as wheat grain or coffee bean.As described later in connection with Figure
6, there has conventionally been known an abrasive type
vertical grain milling machine in which a cylindrical
body or screen comprises for example two or four
perforated or porous arcuate plate members having bran-removing
perforations or holes formed therein and, in
order to lead grain to be milled in a direction from one
end toward the other end of a grain milling chamber when
the grain is rotated within the grain milling chamber in
the direction of rotation of a grain milling roll
assembly, each of the bran-removing holes being an
elongated hole extending inclinedly in the direction of
rotation of the grain milling roll assembly as going
from one end toward the other end of the grain milling
chamber.In this kind of grain milling machine, the
bran-removing holes substantially serve to feed
uniformly the grain to be milled toward the downstream
side.Further, there has been also known an abrasive
type vertical grain milling machine in which the
perforated or porous cylindrical body comprises the
perforated arcuate plate members formed with the bran-removing 
holes and each of the bran-removing holes

<CLAIMS>
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine (1) in which grain to be milled is
introduced into a cylindrical grain milling chamber (40) from vertical one end of said

grain milling chamber (40) and grain having been milled is discharged from the other
end of the same, said grain milling machine (1) comprising:


an abrasive type grain milling roll assembly (16) mounted on a main shaft (3)
extending straight in the vertical direction; and
a perforated cylindrical body (42) extending vertically around said roll assembly
(16) leaving a space therefrom so as to form said cylindrical grain milling chamber (40)

around said roll assembly (16) in cooperation with an outer peripheral surface of said
roll assembly (16) and having a large number of bran-removing holes (41) through

which bran produced in said grain milling chamber (40) is allowed to be released,
wherein said cylindrical body (42) comprises at least one arcuate plate member
(46)
characterized in that
in said arcuate plate member (46) there are provided a first group of bran-removing
holes (41a) and a second group of bran-removing holes (41b) therein, the first group of

bran-removing holes (41a) having an elongated shape extending inclinedly downwards
in the direction of rotation (D) of the roll assembly (16), wherein each of the first group

of elongated bran-removing holes (41a) is formed to extend inclinedly along a first
leading direction so as to lead the grain to be milled in the direction from said one end

toward said other end of said grain milling chamber (40) when said grain is rotated in
the direction of rotation (D) of the grain milling roll assembly (16) within the grain milling

chamber, while each of the second group of elongated bran-removing holes (41a) is 
formed to extend inclined along a second leading direction opposite from said first

leading direction so as to lead the grain to be milled in the direction from said other end
toward said one end of said grain milling chamber (40) when said grain is rotated in the

direction of rotation of the grain milling roll assembly within the grain milling chamber.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling
machine according to Claim 1, wherein number of said

second group of holes is considerably smaller than that
of said first group of holes.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling
machine according to Claim 1, wherein said second group 

of holes are distributed between said first group of
holes as being collected by plural holes.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling
machine according to Claim 4, wherein said second group

of holes are distributed between said first group of

direction and provided between circumferentially
adjacent edge portions of said four perforated arcuate

plate members while being projected radially inwardly so
as to impart a resistance to movement of grains in the

circumferential direction of said roll assembly, an
amount of projection of said resistance members being

adjustable.
An abrasive type vertical grain milling
machine according to Claim 1, wherein said perforated

cylindrical body comprises two perforated arcuate plate 
members each defining an outer periphery of the grain

milling chamber through an angular range of about 180°,

direction and provided between circumferentially
adjacent edge portions of said two perforated arcuate

plate members while being projected radially inwardly so
as to impart a resistance to movement of grains in the

circumferential direction of said roll assembly, an
amount of projection of said resistance members being
