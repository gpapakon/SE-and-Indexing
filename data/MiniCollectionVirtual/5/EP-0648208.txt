<ABSTRACT>
A compound of formula (I), wherein R
<
1
>
 is an optionally protected carboxy(lower)alkyl, R
<
2
>
 is a hydrogen, an optionally substituted aryl or a carboxy, X is a bond, -O-, -NH- or a cycloalkylene, and Y is an alkylene which may be interrupted by an oxygen atom, an alkenylene or an alkadienylene, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The compound of the present invention is useful as a testosterone 5 alpha -reductase inhibitor and effective against testosterone 5 alpha -reductase-mediated diseases such as prostatism, prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic cancer, alopecia, hirsutism (e.g. female hirsutism), androgenic alopecia (or male-pattern baldness), acne (e.g. acne vulgaris, pimple), and another hyperandrogenisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTION INDOLE DERIVATIVES AS TESTOSTERONE 5 ALPHA-REDUCTASE INHIBITORSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to novel indole derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More particularly, it relates to novel indole derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, .which have pharmacological activities such as inhibitory activity on testosterone 5a<-reductase, to a process for the preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same, and to a use of the same as a medicament.Backgroud ArtIt has hitherto been known that indole derivatives are effective for testosterone 5a,-reductase-mediated diseases. However, a testosterone 5α-reductase inhibitor with stronger effect has been demanded.Disclosure of the InventionAccordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide novel indole derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as a testosterone 5a- reductase inhibitor.Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of said indole derivatives or salts thereof.A further object of the present invention is to provide a 

pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, said indole derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.A still further object of the present invention is to provide use of said indole derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as a medicament such as a testosterone 5α-reductase inhibitor useful for treating and/or preventing testosterone 5a-reductase-mediated diseases such as alopecia, acnes and prostatism in human being or animals.Indole derivatives of the present invention are novel and can be represented by the formula (I):
 wherein R1 is an optionally protected carboxy(lower)alkyl,R2 is a hydrogen, an optionally substituted aryl or a carboxy,X is a bond, -0-, -NH-, or a cycloalkylene, andY is an alkylene which may be interrupted by an oxygen atom, an alkenylene or an alkadienylene.According to the present invention, the object compound (I) and a salt thereof can be prepared by the following processes. 

[Process 1]
 H(III)(II) or a salt thereof or a salt thereofor a salt thereof[Process 2]G - CO-X-Y-R2W2-R1H(IV) (V) or a salt thereof or a salt thereof
