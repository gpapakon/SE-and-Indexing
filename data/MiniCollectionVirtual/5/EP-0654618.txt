tube (12); an inner tube (14) positioned inside the 

outer tube; a rod guide (22) closing one end (26,30) 
of the inner tube and the outer tube; a compensation 

valve assembly (20) closing the other end (24) of the 
inner tube; the other end (28) of the outer tube being 

closed; a piston assembly (16) slidably sealably 
positioned inside the inner tube and dividing the 

inner tube into a rebound chamber (36) and a 
compression chamber (38); a piston rod (18) connected 

to the piston assembly and extending through the 
rebound chamber and the rod guide; a compensation 

chamber (40) formed between the inner tube and the 
outer tube; and a damping valve (5

aperture through the inner tube from the compression 

chamber, the damping valve being actuable by 
differential pressure above a predetermined level to 

allow flow of fluid in one direction only from the 
compression chamber through the aperture to the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shock
absorber or hydraulic damper, and in particular to a
shock absorber having a damping valve for controlling
the flow of fluid between two fluid chambers in the
shock absorber.Known shock absorbers comprise an inner
tube; an outer tube; a compensation chamber formed
between the inner and outer tubes; a piston assembly
sealably slidably mounted in the inner tube, the
piston assembly separating a compression chamber from
a rebound chamber within the inner tube; a rod guide
positioned at one end of the inner and outer tubes; a
piston rod connected to the piston assembly and
extending through the rebound chamber and the rod
guide; and a compensation valve assembly positioned at
the other end of the inner tube. These known shock
absorbers are commonly referred to as twin-tubed
dampers. In these known arrangements, the piston
assembly typically comprises a number of apertures
normally closed by one of two valve elements (such as
resilient discs). One valve element allows flow of
fluid through some of the apertures from the rebound
chamber to the compression chamber, and the other
valve element allows flow of fluid through the
remaining apertures during use of the shock absorber.
Similarly the compensation valve assembly allows fluid
flow between the compression chamber and the
compensation chamber during use of the shock absorber.
Bleed passages are also provided through the piston
assembly and the compensation valve assembly to allow
restricted flow of fluid during periods when the
piston assembly is moving at a slow speed relative to
the inner tube. This arrangement has the disadvantage
that adjustment or setting of the damping
characteristics of the suspension strut, especially at 
slow speeds is extremely difficult to control.
Further, the apertures and bleed passages are
susceptible to being easily blocked by dirt.GB-A-594006 describes a shock absorber in
accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.It is an aim of the present invention to
overcome the above mentioned disadvantages.A shock absorber in accordance with the
present invention is characterised over GB-A-594006 by
the features specified in the characterising portion
of Claim 1.The present invention will now be described,
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of a
shock absorber in accordance with the present
invention;Figure 2 is an enlarged cross-sectional
partial view of the compensation valve assembly of the
shock absorber of Figure

<CLAIMS>
A shock absorber (10) comprising an
outer tube(12); an inner tube (14) positioned inside

the outer tube; a rod guide (22) closing one end
(26,30) of the inner tube and the outer tube; a

compensation valve assembly (20) closing the other end
(24) of the inner tube; the other end (28) of the

outer tube being closed; a piston assembly (16)
slidably sealably positioned inside the inner tube and

dividing the inner tube into a rebound chamber (36)
and a compression chamber (38); a piston rod (18)

connected to the piston assembly and extending through
the rebound chamber and the rod guide; a compensation

chamber (40) formed between the inner tube and the
outer tube; and a damping valve (50) covering an

aperture (48) through the inner tube from the
compression chamber, the damping valve being actuable

by differential pressure above a predetermined level
to allow flow of fluid in one direction only from the

compression chamber through the aperture to the
compensation chamber; characterised in that a bore

extends through the piston assembly from the
compression chamber (38) into the piston rod and

includes a diametrically extending bore in the piston
rod opening at apertures into the rebound chamber

(36) ; the shock absorber further comprising an
additional damping valve covering the apertures in the

piston rod, the additional damping valve allowing flow
of fluid in one direction only from the compression

chamber to the rebound chamber.
A shock absorber as claimed in Claim 1,
further comprising a second damping valve (50')

covering a second aperture through the inner tube (14)
from the rebound chamber (36), the second damping

valve being actuable by differential pressure above a 
predetermined level to allow flow of fluid in one

direction only from the rebound chamber through the
second aperture to the compensation chamber (40).
A shock absorber as claimed in Claim 1
or Claim 2, wherein the compensation valve assembly

(20") comprises a stub portion (74) extending into the
compression chamber (38), a bore (70) extending

through the compensation valve assembly from the
compensation chamber and including a diametrically

extending bore (72) in the stub portion opening at
apertures (48") into the compression chamber; the

shock absorber further comprising an additional
damping valve (50") covering the apertures in the stub

portion, the additional damping valve allowing flow of
fluid in one direction only from the compensation

chamber to the compression chamber.
A shock absorber as claimed in any one
of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the or each damping valve

(50) comprises a main body (52) which is of flexible
material and has an annular configuration; a band (54)

of resilient material positioned internally of the
main body, the main body overlying the band to define

an annular flexible portion (58) adjacent each
circumferential edge (60); and a band spring (56)

acting on each flexible portion to bias the associated
flexible portion into contact with the inner tube

(14).
A shock absorber as claimed in Claim 4,
wherein the band (54) has a number of inwardly

directed pips (62) to space the band from the inner
tube (14).
A shock absorber as claimed in Claim 1

one end (182) to the outer surface of the inner tube 

(114), and a hemispherical ball (184) secured to the
arm at the other end (186), the arm biasing the ball

to normally close the aperture (148).
