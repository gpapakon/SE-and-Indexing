<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heatset printing ink for
the printing of documents by intaglio printing, i.e,
engraved steel die printing. The ink has been found to
be especially useful for the printing of security
documents such as stamps, checks, stock certificates,
bank notes, tickets, etc.; the printing ink of the
present invention is particularly suited for use as a
currency ink.The current process for printing security documents,
especially currency, is sheetfed non-heatset intaglio.
Sheetfed non-heatset intaglio inks are based on
oxidizable resins and alkyds and are very slow drying.
Typically, one side of the currency is printed first and
after 24-48 hours, the other side is printed. The
typical maximum printing speed of such inks is about 75
m/min. US-A-4,966,628 discloses typical non-heatset
sheetfed intaglio inks suitable for printing of
security documents.The term "intaglio printing" refers to a
printing process wherein a printing cylinder or printing
plate carries the engraved pattern and the engraved
recess is filled with printing ink to be transferred to
the printing substrate in order to create the document. 
In this type of printing, typically a rotating engraved
cylinder (usually manufactured from steel, nickel or
copper and plated with chromium) is supplied with ink by
one or more template inking cylinders by which a pattern
of inks of different color is transferred to the printing
cylinder. Any excess ink on the surface of the cylinder
is then wiped off by a rotating wiper cylinder covered by
a plastisol, using a dilute aqueous solution of sodium
hydroxide and sulfonated castor oil as an emulsifying
medium for the wiped-off excess ink. Thereafter, the
printing pattern is transferred, under a pressure of up
to 105 kg/cm2, to the substrate.Recently, a heatset intaglio printing ink was
developed at the laboratories of the assignee. Such ink
is described in US-A-5,100,934.The inks described in this patent
permitted security documents, especially currency, to be
printed by heatset intaglio, thereby resulting in an
improved product and in a printing process which permits
the obverse of the printed document to be printed an
instant after printing the face. However, the inks
described in US-A-5,100,934 require relatively high
heatset temperatures. While such high temperatures
insure very rapid drying and high throughput rates, the
high heatset temperatures also tend to produce
undesirable yellowing and/or crinkling of the paper
substrate. In contradistinction thereto, the heatset
inks of the
