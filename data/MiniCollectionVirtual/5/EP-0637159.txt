<ABSTRACT>
A call sequencing facility (150) is deployed in a telecommunications 
network (100) to allow a caller (e.g. S 1) who is trying to reach a called subscriber to 

be routed to each of a sequence of telephone numbers specified by the subscriber, 
even though a call placed to one such telephone number is answered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the processing of telephone calls in a
telecommunications system.Among the various forward-looking concepts being implemented or
planned for the balance of the decade, and beyond, is the notion of sequence calling.
Once this feature is deployed, a telephone service subscriber will be enabled to
specify to the telecommunications infrastructure a sequence of telephone numbers to
which a call to the subscriber can be routed until the subscriber is "found". For
example, a subscriber to a "700" telephone number, such as a so-called personal
EasyReachâ„¢ 700 number obtained from AT&T, will be able to specify that a call
made to that number should be routed, for example, first to the subscriber's office
telephone number and then, if no answer there, to the cellular telephone number
associated with the subscriber's car telephone and, if no answer there, to the
subscriber's home telephone number. The prior art in this regard is typified by the
technology described in U.S. patent No. 5,222,125 issued to C. W. Creswell et al on
June 22, 1993. JP-A-61 001 154 discloses a call connection method that allows a subscriber to
telephone a group of pre-identified telephone numbers.In the method of JP-A-61 001 154, a subscriber enters a list of telephone numbers and
is given a special telephone number. When the subscriber wishes to telephone all the pre-identified
telephone numbers, they dial the special telephone number and this causes an
outdoing telephone call to be placed from the subscriber to one of the pre-identified telephone
numbers. When the conversation between the subscriber and the first called party has
finished the call is terminated by the first called party going on-hook, and this causes a
telephone call to be placed from the subscriber to another of the pre-identified telephone
numbers.The present invention provides a method as defined in claim 1. The method of the
invention allows an incoming call to a subscriber to be routed to a sequence of telephone
numbers for the subscriber.In the drawing,
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a communications network which includes
a service adjunct implementing a personal telephone number service;FIG. 2 shows a number of the fields of a record containing profile
information for a subscriber to the service;FIGs. 3-8 show in flow chart form the program which implements the
principles of the invention in the service adjunct and Operator Service Position
System (OSPS) shown in FIG. 1;FIG. 9 is a block diagram of the service adjunct, and FIG. 10

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a telecommunications system (100) in which an incoming call
originated by a caller is routed in accordance with a sequence of telephone numbers

(CFNUM1, CFNUM2, CFNUM3) specified by a subscriber, the method comprising the steps
of:


retrieving said sequence of telephone numbers in response to receipt of said incoming
call;
selecting one of said sequence of telephone numbers and routing the incoming call in
accordance with the selected telephone number;
selecting, in response to an indication supplied by the caller, a next one of said sequence
of telephone numbers; and
routing the incoming call in accordance with the next selected telephone number even
if the call placed to the previous selected telephone number had been completed.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the indication is a signal input from a
telephone keypad.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the indication is a command spoken by the
caller.
