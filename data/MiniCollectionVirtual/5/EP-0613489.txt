<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of new and novel furnace carbon blacks which 
are suitable for various applications and particularly well suited for use in rubber compositions. Carbon blacks are generally produced in a furnace-type reactor by pyrolyzing a 
hydrocarbon feedstock with hot combustion gases to produce combustion products containing 
particulate carbon black. Carbon blacks may be utilized as pigments, fillers, reinforcing agents and for a variety 
of other applications. For example, carbon blacks are widely utilized as fillers and reinforcing 
agents in the compounding and preparation of rubber compositions for industrial rubber 
applications. WO 91/17114 for example discloses carbon blacks and rubber compositions 
comprising said carbon blacks, which show a CTAB of 65-85 m²/g; a DBP of 
130-160 cc/100g; a CTAB No. ratio of 1.15-1.35; a ΔDBP of 20-40 cc/100g; 
a Tint value of 85-100; a Dmode of 115-135 nm and a ΔD₅₀/Dmode ratio 
of 0.65-0.90. The rubber compositions exhibit increased abrasion resistance and 
lower hysteresis properties and they are used e.g. for tires.  
 Rubber compositions for industrial rubber applications further include hoses, belts, 
electrical cable insulation and roofing compounds. Generally hoses, belts and electrical cable 
insulation are produced through extrusion techniques, i.e. the rubber composition is extruded 
through a die ad then cooled or chemically hardened. It is generally desirable in the production of rubber compositions to utilize carbon 
blacks which when incorporated will result in rubber compositions with reduced extrusion 
shrinkage. As is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, rubber compounds generally swell 
upon extrusion. This means that the cross sectional area of the extrudate is larger than the cross 
sectional area of the die opening through which it was forced. A low value for extrusion 
shrinkage correlates to a situation where compound swelling is reduced, and the extrudate cross 
sectional area is close to that of the die opening. Such compound behavior results in the 
compound having the intended size for the desired finished part. Accordingly, a object of the present invention is the production of new carbon blacks 
which impart improved extrusion shrinkage properties to natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers and 
blends of natural and synthetic rubbers in which the carbon blacks are incorporated.  
 Another object of the present invention is new rubber compositions, advantageous for 
use in industrial rubber
