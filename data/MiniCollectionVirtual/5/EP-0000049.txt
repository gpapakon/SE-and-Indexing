<ABSTRACT>
1. Process for the dry development of two-component diazotype copying material, especially of microfilm duplicating film on a polyester basis, which can not be developed by the mere application of heat, and is developed by passing it at a temperature between about 105 and 120 degrees C and a predetermined pressure, preferably atmospheric pressure, through a developer gas atmosphere which substantially comprises a tensionally unsaturated ammonia gas/water vapor mixture containing from 3 to 25 per cent by weight of ammonia, the process being characterized in that, prior to entering the developer gas atmosphere, the diazotype copying material passes through a predeveloping atmosphere which has a temperature between 100 and 110 degrees C and an ammonia concentration amounting to 20 to 80 per cent of the ammonia concentration of the developer gas atmosphere.
