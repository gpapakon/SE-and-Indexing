<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (13) for automatically inspecting top 
end stops (2) of a slide fastener (1) while the slide fastener 

(1) is fed by pulling it by grippers (9) toward a 
discharge station, with a slider (6) having a pull tab (7) 

and a bottom end stop (5) attached to the slide fastener 
(1), wherein an image sensor or camera (14) is disposed 

adjacent to the feed path on an upstream side of the discharge 
station to read an image of the top end stops (2) for 

inspecting an attached condition of the top end stops (2) 
effected on data of the image read by the camera (14) using 

an image-processing technique, and a fastener support unit 
(16) is disposed in the feed path upstream of the camera (14) 

for supporting a portion of the slide fastener (1) in the 
vicinity of the bottom end stop (5) to keep the slide fastener 

(1) stable while the image of the top end stops (2) is read 
by the camera (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
inspecting top end stops of a slide fastener,
(see for example EP-A-O 111 305) and more
particularly to such a top-end-stop inspection apparatus
which is constructed to discriminate the quality of top end
stops attached to a slide fastener by an image-processing
technique.Conventionally, a pair of top end stops attached to
a slide fastener is inspected for attachment failures or
defects through visual inspection by a human inspector.However, the visual inspection is laborious, time-consuming,
low in efficiency, uneconomical, and unstable as
it depends on each person's judgment. Accordingly, there
has been a keen demand for an automated inspection system.It is accordingly an object of the present invention
to provide an apparatus for automatically and accurately
inspecting the attached condition of top end stops of a
slide fastener.To attain the object, the present invention provides 
an apparatus for automatically inspecting top end stops of
a slide fastener while the slide fastener is fed longitudinally
along a feed path by pulling it by a pair of grippers
toward a discharge station, with a slider having a pull tab
and a bottom end stop attached to the slide fastener.
The apparatus comprises an image sensor disposed adjacent
to the feed path on an upstream side of the discharge station
to read an image of the top end stops for inspecting
an attached condition of the top end stops effected on data
of the image read by the image sensor using an image-processing
technique, and fastener support means disposed in the feed
path upstream of the image sensor for supporting a portion
of the slide fastener in the vicinity of the bottom end stop
to keep the slide fastener lying flat while the image of the
top end stops is read by the image sensor.In an preferred embodiment, the fastener support
means comprises a substantially U-shaped support block
disposed below the feed path and vertically movable toward
the feed path for guiding and supporting the slide fastener.
As an alternative, the fastener support means may comprise a
substantially U-shaped support member fixedly disposed to
contact a front or rear surface of the slide fastener, and
a substantially U-shaped resilient presser member fixedly
disposed to contact the rear or front surface of the slide
fastener for urging the slide fastener against the support 
member to resiliently hold therebetween the slide fastener
while permitting movement of the slider through the fastener
support means without

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (13) for inspecting top end stops
(2, 2) of a slide fastener (1) while the slide fastener (1)

is fed longitudinally along a feed path by pulling it by a
pair of grippers (9) toward a discharge station, with a

slider (6) having a pull tab (7) and a bottom end stop (5)
attached to the slide fastener (1), characterized by:


(a) an image sensor (14) disposed adjacent to the
feed path on an upstream side of the discharge station to

read an image of the top end stops (2) for inspecting an attached
condition of the top end stops (2) effected on data

of the image read by said image sensor (14) using an image-processing
technique; and
(b) fastener support means (16; 16a) disposed in
the feed path upstream of said image sensor (14) for supporting

a portion of the slide fastener (1) in the vicinity
of the bottom end stop (5) to keep the slide fastener (1)

stable while the image of the top end stops (2) is read by
said image sensor (14).
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising, another image sensor (23) disposed adjacent to

the feed path on a downstream side of a space detecting unit
(10) situated at the most upstream position of the apparatus.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
fastener support means (16) is composed of a substantially 

U-shaped support block which is vertically movable toward and
away from the feed path and is retracted downwardly while said

support block (16) is not supporting the slide fastener (1) so
as not to obstruct the movement of the slider (6).
An apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said
fastener support means (16a) comprises a substantially U-shaped

support member (21) fixedly disposed to contact a front
or rear surface of the slide fastener (1), and a substantially

U-shaped resilient presser member (22) fixedly disposed to
contact a rear or front surface of the slide fastener (1)

for urging the slide fastener (1) against said support member
(1) to resiliently hold therebetween the slide fastener (1)

while permitting movement of the slider (6) through said fastener
support means (16a) without interference.
An apparatus according to any one of preceding
claims, when used with the slide fastener (1) fed with the pull

tab (7) of the slider (6) hanging down from a body of the slider
(6), further including pull-tab holding means (18) for preventing

the pull tab (7) of the slider (6) from pivotally moving toward
the top end stops (2) while the image of the top end stops (2)

is read by said image sensor (14).
An apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said
pull-tab holding means (18) comprises a pull-tab holding

strip disposed adjacent to and upstream of said image sensor
(14) and inclined upwardly toward a direction of feed of the 

slide fastener (1) for holding thereon the pull tab (7) of the
slider (6) while the image of the top end stops (2) is read

by said image sensor (14).
