<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus driven by a battery-powered (17) electric motor (11). The motor (11) may be actuated simply by inserting a bottle neck into an abutment portion (1). The motor drives a corkscrew member (8) via a reduction gear (10) so that it penetrates the seal and cork, and lowers the assembly (10, 11) along two fixed guides (7). A portion (9) engages a sleeve (5) which the rotational force pivots through ten degrees to enable a circular blade (3) secured to the sleeve (5) to cut through the seal. After the cork has been fully drawn up, the motor (11) switches off, and when the bottle neck is withdrawn, the direction of rotation is reversed until the cork and seal are ejected, whereafter the motor (11) cuts out. At no time during the whole operation does the user need to handle the apparatus or the bottle.
