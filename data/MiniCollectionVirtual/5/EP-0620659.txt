<ABSTRACT>
Utilization of an electrical link separate from an optical transmission 
path to gather information identifying the number and types of optical devices in the 

optical path and utilization of this information to adjust the power output level of an 
optical transmitter and to transmit the power output level to optical receivers 

connected to the optical transmitter by the optical path. Each optical receiver (145, 
150) is responsive to the number and types of optical components in the path 

between the optical receiver and the optical transmitter (128) and the power output 
level to adjust the sensitivity of the optical receiver. Each optical component is 

associated with an electrical identification circuit (111, 112, 114, 115) connected to 
the electrical link which specifies the information on the electrical link concerning 

the optical component including the performance characteristics of the optical 
component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical transmission systems, and, in particular, 
to controlling the output power of optical transmitters and sensitivity of optical 
receivers in a multipath optical transmission system. The capability of being able to adjust the output power of an optical 
transmitter in response to changing conditions within a transmission system and to 
transfer that output power information to each optical receiver is very important in 
large optical transmission systems. One such optical system is commonly called the 
fiber-in-the-loop (FITL) system which will provide optical fiber connections to 
residential homes. In such systems, there are a large number of optical components 
in various optical paths, and it is a difficult problem to maintain records which 
specify the number and type of optical components in each optical path. The number 
and type of optical components is particularly important in optical transmission 
systems since attenuation is introduced into the optical transmission path by the 
optical fibers, splices, connectors, splitters, combiners, etc. The present residential 
telephone systems illustrate the problems of maintaining accurate records of installed 
equipment and cables in the residential environment. One prior art method for correcting this type of situation with respect to 
the output power level is to manually adjust the optical transmitter and optical 
receivers by physically adjusting the transmitters and receivers or by entering 
information into a computer controlling the transmission system and having the 
computer adjust each individual receiver and transmitter. The problems with a 
manual adjustment procedure are expense and probability of human errors. In another prior art method, U.S. Patent No. 5,060,302 discloses an 
optical receiver feeding back information to an optical transmitter to adjust the 
output of the optical transmitter. There are two problems with this prior art solution. 
First, it only functions where a transmitter is driving a single receiver; and second, it 
requires an additional optical transmitter and receiver for the feedback path which is 
expensive. In addition, no provision is made for the adjustment of the optical 
receiver. Another prior art method which does not require manual entry of data is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,295,043. This patent discloses the use of a connector 
which identifies the length of attached cable by predefined electrical contacts placed 
on the connector of the cable. Different connectors
