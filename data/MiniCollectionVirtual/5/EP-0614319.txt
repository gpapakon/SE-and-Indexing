<ABSTRACT>
A t.v. projection system provides a colour image on a screen (20) using light provided by three lasers (32, 42, 52), supplied to an optical device (60) for colour mixing, deflection and focussing in correspondence with a given television standard. The wavelengths of the light signals are 620 nm, 545 nm and 470 nm, the colour tones defined by colour value signals supplied from an input circuit to a mixer (20) converting them from the original base system for a phosphor television screen to a second base system for the laser projection system, each output signal (R', G', B') of the mixer being fed to a respective modulator (34, 44, 54) associated with one of the lasers.
