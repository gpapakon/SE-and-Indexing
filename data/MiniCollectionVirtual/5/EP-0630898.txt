<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent
for thrombocytopenia and novel indolocarbazole
derivatives. Therapeutic agents for thrombocytopenia are
expected to be useful for the treatment of the decrease
in the number of blood platelets which is a side effect
of chemotherapy for cancer and transplantation of bone
marrow and for various diseases involving
thrombocytopenia.The decrease in the number of blood platelets due to
various kinds of hematopoietic disorders causes grave
symptoms including an increased tendency to hemorrhage.
At present, platelet transfusion is employed as an
effective means for the treatment of such decrease, but
it does not always enable a sufficient supply of blood
platelets.Known hematopoietic factors which stimulate the
production of blood platelets include interleukin (IL) 6
and IL 11.Indolocarbazole derivatives are known to have
inhibitory activity against a variety of protein kinase,
including protein kinase C, antibacterial activity, and
anti-tumor activity [Japanese Published Unexamined Patent

(U.S.P. 4923986), WO 89-07105 (EP-A-383919)].According to the present invention, there is
provided a use of an indolocarbazole derivative represented by the formula (I):

[In the formula, R1 represents hydrogen, 1-6 carbon atoms alkyl,
1-7 carbon atoms alkanoyl, benzyl or amino; R2 represents hydrogen,
hydroxy, 1-6 carbon atoms alkoxy, 1-7 carbon atoms alkanoyl, halogen or the
formula (i):

R3 represents hydrogen, 1-7 carbon atoms alkanoyl, halogen, hydroxy
or 1-6 carbon atoms alkoxy; one of W1 and W2 is hydrogen, and the
other is hydrogen, hydroxy or 1-6 carbon atoms alkylthio, or W1 and
W2 are combined together to represent oxygen; and A1 and
A2 are the same and are hydrogen, or A1 and A2 are
combined together to represent the formula (ii): 

(wherein R6 is hydrogen, benzyloxycarbonyl, 1-6 carbon atoms alkyl
or 1-7 carbon atoms alkanoyl), or the formula (iii):

(wherein R4 is hydrogen, 1-6 carbon atoms alkyl, methoxymethyl or
1-7 carbon atoms alkanoyl; and R5 is hydrogen or 2-7 carbon atoms
alkoxycarbonyl).], or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the preparation of a therapeutic agent for treating thrombocytopenia.The therapeutic agent
