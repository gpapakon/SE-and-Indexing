<ABSTRACT>
Furnace (1) for melting metal-bearing substances and/or smelting of liquid metal (4), of the type in which the said metal (4) has above it a layer of slag (5) capable of being affected by a "foaming" phenomenon, characterised in that a side wall of the said furnace has an orifice (17) emerging into an adjacent trough (22) capped with a vault (25), it being possible for the said trough (22) to collect by overflowing through the said orifice (17) a portion of the said slag (5) when the said foaming phenomenon takes on proportions resulting in a risk of damage to the said furnace (1). The invention also relates to a process for smelting liquid metal, employing such a furnace.

Process for the production of a liquid metal,
such as steel, in an electric arc furnace comprising a

vessel containing the said liquid metal and a vault
which is cooled by the internal circulation of a

cooling liquid and which caps the said vessel, at the
same time bearing on the upper periphery of the side

wall of the said vessel, according to which process a
phenomenon of the "foaming" of the slag layer

surmounting the said liquid metal is caused or
experienced, characterized in that, for the purpose of

avoiding damaging the upper parts of the furnace and
the bearing zones of the vault due to their coming into

contact with the foaming slag, a fraction of the said
foaming slag is allowed to overflow into a tank

adjacent to the said furnace by way of at least one
orifice made in the upper part of the side wall of the

said furnace, the said tank being closed by a vault and
being connected sealingly to the furnace.
Electric arc furnace (1) for melting
metalliferous substances and/or for producing liquid

metal (4), of the type comprising a vessel containing
the said liquid metal (4) and a vault (7) which is

cooled by the internal circulation of a cooling liquid
and which caps the said vessel, at the same time

bearing on the upper periphery of the side wall (6, 6')
of the said vessel, characterized in that a side wall

of the said furnace (1) comprises at least one orifice
(17) opening into an adjacent tank (22) capped by a 

vault (25) and connected sealingly to the furnace (1),
the lower edge (18) of the said orifice (17) being

placed at the maximum acceptable level which a foaming
slag (5) may reach without the risk of damaging the

upper parts of the furnace (1) and the bearing zones of
the vault (7), so as to allow a simple overflow of a

portion of the foaming slag (5) into the tank (22).
Furnace according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the said vault (25) of the said tank (22) is

connected to a conduit (30) for discharging the gases
present in the furnace (1) towards a plant for trapping

and removing dust from the said gases.
Furnace according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that it consists of a metallurgical electric

arc furnace.
Furnace according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the said liquid metal (4) results from the melting

of ferriferous substances mixed with carbon-containing
substances, and in that it comprises means (11, 11',

11'', 11''') for carrying out the decarburizing of the
said liquid metal (4).
Furnace according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that it consists of a metallurgical ladle

furnace.
