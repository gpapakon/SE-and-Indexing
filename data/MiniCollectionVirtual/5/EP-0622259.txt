Chock intended to be mounted on a reinforcement bar (2) 
of a motor vehicle door, t
he bar (2) being located 
between a member such as the outer panel (3) of the 

door (1) and another member such as the window (4), 
particularly when the latter is lowered, characterised 

in that it comprises means for holding it in position 
relative to the bar (2) and means for preventing the 

banging of the panel (3) and the window (4) against the 
bar (2), this chock comprising on the one hand a rigid 

portion (12a) intended to be placed in contact with the 
bar (2) and on the other hand at least one flexible 

portion integral with the rigid portion (12a) and 
capable of coming into contact with the panel (3) and 

one flexible portion integral with the rigid portion 
(12a) and capable of coming into contact with the 

window (4), said flexible portions constituting 
respectively means for preventing the banging of the 

panel (3) and means for preventing the banging of the 
window (4) against the bar (2). 
Chock according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
holding means comprise means for bearing against the 

panel. 
Chock according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
bearing means comprise said flexible portion capable of 

coming into contact with the panel (3). 
Chock according to Claim 3, characterised in that said 
flexible portion is in the form of a lip (12e; 12m) 

capable of bearing against the panel (3). 
Chock according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that 
the bearing means comprise, on said flexible portion 

(12i), ribs (12j) capable of coming into contact with  
 

the panel 3). 
Chock according to Claim 3, characterised in that said 
flexible portion (12b) is tubular and capable of being 

crushed between the panel (3) and the bar (2). 
Chock according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that, when it is fitted on the bar 

(2), the holding means comprise means for preventing it 
from being removed. 
Chock according to Claim 7, characterised in that it is 
in contact with the bar (2), when this has a circular 

section, over a length greater than half the 
circumference of the bar (2), thus constituting the 

means for preventing it from being removed. 
Chock according to Claim 7, characterised in that it is 
in contact with the bar (2), when this has a circular 

section, over a distance less than or equal to half the 
circumference of the bar (2) and the means for 

preventing it from being removed comprise a pin (13) 
integral with the bar (2), the stem (13a) of which 

passes through a groove (12g) made in the chock (12) 
and the head of which (13b) extends over a distance 

greater than the width of the groove (12g). 
Chock according to Claim 7, characterised in that it is 
in contact with the bar (2), when this has a circular 

section, over a distance less than or equal to half the 
circumference of the bar (2) and the means for 

preventing it from being removed comprise a lip made of 
rigid material (12q) capable of bearing against the bar 

(2). 
Chock according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the aforementioned holding means  

 
comprise means for immobilisation in rotation. 
Chock according to Claim 11, characterised in that the 
means for immobilisation in rotation comprise at least 

one lip made of flexible or rigid material (12d; 12k; 
12n) capable of coming into contact with the panel (3). 
Chock according to Claims 9 and 11, characterised in 
that the groove (12g) is oriented longitudinally in 

relation to the bar (2) so as to constitute, together 
with the stem (13a) of the pin (13) the means for 

immobilisation in rotation. 
Chock according to Claim 11 considered in combination 
with Claim 5, characterised in that the means for 

immobilisation in rotation are constituted by the 
aforementioned ribs (12j). 
Chock according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that said flexible portion (12c; 12f) 

capable of coming into contact with the window (4) is 
continuous with the rigid portion (12a) of the chock 

(12). 
Chock according to one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised 
in that said flexible portion capable of coming into 

contact with the window (4) is a pin made of flexible 
material (12
l
) fixed to the rigid portion (12a) of the 
chock (12). 
Chock according to one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised 
in that said flexible portion capable of coming into 

contact with the window (4) takes the form of a lip 
made of flexible material (12o) integral with the rigid 

portion (12a) of the chock (12). 
Chock according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised  
 

in that one or other of said flexible portions takes 
the form of a mass of flexible material (12r; 12s) 

surmounting the rigid portion (12a) of the chock (12).
