<ABSTRACT>
The cathode of an input protective diode (40) is connected directly to the drain (30D) of an input protective MOS transistor 
(30). The source (30S), the gate (30G), and the anode of the input protection diode (40) are grounded. Thus, overvoltage inputted 

from the external terminal is received by the cathode of the diode (40) and the drain (30D) before such a voltage is transferred to 
the internal circuit of a semiconductor device. Hence there is no increase in the junction capacitance of the input protective diode 

due to the pattern of the diode (40). The voltage value at which the input protective MOS transistor (30) conducts can be lowered 
because the input protective diode (40) breaks down by overvoltage before it reaches the internal circuit. As a result, it is possible 

to achieve reliable input protection at a high speed. Also, since the input terminal can be connected directly to the drain (30D) of 
the input protective MOS transistor (30), the input protective circuit shown is applicable to an output protection circuit and an 

output MOS transistor, thus making it possible to protect the internal output circuit reliably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an input protection circuit for
protecting an internal input circuit or to an output protection circuit for
protecting an internal output circuit (collectively called an i/o protection
circuit hereinafter) when an excessive input voltage is applied to an
external electrode of a semiconductor device.A diode and resistors are arranged on the side of the input electrode
relative to an input protection MOS transistor for lengthening a rise time
of voltage surge input thereto to'cope with an abrupt surge of voltage by
way of the time constant of the junction capacitance of the diode and the
resistances of the resistors.The output circuit is substantially identical to the i/o protection
circuit for protecting the input circuit which is described above. In case of
the output protection circuit, an output MOS transistor itself serves as the
output protection MOS transistor. Since the output MOS transistor
generally occupies a large area, the protection diode serving as a
capacitor is not used.The conventional input or output protection circuit, however, reacts
as a delay element also to normal signals since it is equipped with a
protection diode and protection resistors for lengthening the rise time of
input voltage. As a result, the transmission of signal in the input or
output circuit is delayed so that speeding up device operation as a whole is 
prevented. Particularly elements are miniaturized and the speeding up a
device operation is in progress nowadays, so that it is not negligible as a
factor preventing the speeding up.The Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 11, 277 and JP-A-62 76676 disclose providing a
protection circuit at an input terminal and at an output terminal to prevent distruction due to
electrostatic. Also this document discloses a transistor T1 (or T3) and a diode D1 (or D2)
constitute such protecting circuits. The transistor T1 (or T3) has a gate electrode connected
to a source electrode which is grounded, and a drain electrode connected to an input terminal
(or to an output terminal). JP-A-62 76676 further discloses that one end of the diode D1 is
connected to the drain electrode of the transistor T1, and that one end of the diode D2 is
connected to the output terminal.Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 3, 111 and JP-A-54 89586 disclose that a diode 43 constitutes
a protection circuit, and that one end of the diode 43 is connected to an external connecting
member 44 and the other end of the diode 43 is grounded.The European Patent Application 0 215 493 discloses a
