<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is relates to a silver halide 
light-sensitive photographic material and, especially, to a 
silver halide light-sensitive photographic material which 
comprises silver halide emulsion containing silver halide 
grains of which storage stability is improved by incorporating 
therein a specific novel compound. Recently, the improvement in the preservation stability 
of the silver halide light-sensitive photographic materials 
has been a strong demand as well as the demand for high 
sensitivity and low fog. In the image-forming technology using silver halide 
light-sensitive photographic materials, it is well known that 
two steps are necessary to form an image. That is; 
(a) a step of imagewise exposing a silver halide light-sensitive 
photographic material to light to form a latent  
 
image; and (b) a step of developing thus imagewise exposed 
photographic material to convert the formed latent image into 
a silver image or a dye image. Concerning these processes, for instance, there is a 
detailed description in "The Theory of the Photographic 
Process", by James. The formation of latent image is a microscopic change of 
state in silver halide crystal by exposure and the latent 
image itself is essentially unstable. Therefore, the latent image is liable to be decayed or 
intensified with the lapse of time between exposure and 
development. The decay of latent image is called, in the field of 
photographic industry, "latent-image fading" and the latter is 
called "latent image progression". Generally, the behavior of the latent image depends 
strongly upon the storage condition of the exposed light-sensitive 
material and, for example, the latent-image fading 
or the latent image intensification is remarkable in the 
preservation under high temperature. On the other hand, the 
latent-image fading hardly be caused when the light-sensitive 
material is stored under low temperature. One method to solve this problem is to carry out 
development process immediately after imagewise exposure. 
Another method is simply to store the exposed photographic 
material under cool condition.  These are the simplest methods from chemical point of 
view, but they are not necessarily welcomed to the customer. In fact, for example, it is often the case that the 
imagewise exposed photographic material is left as it is for a 
period of several months without undergoing development. In the case of multi-layered color photographic 
materials, the latent image fading or the latent image 
intensification
