<ABSTRACT>
A refining segment for a disc refiner for defibering and 
processing lignocellulose-containing fiber material. The 

refining segment has the shape of a circle sector and a 
refining surface with bars and intermediate grooves, which 

extend across substantially the entire refining surface. 
The bars are oblique in relation to the radius of the 

refining segment, and the angle of the bars in relation to 
said radius is greatest closest to the centre and thereafter 

decreases in radial outward direction. The angle closest 
to the centre shall be in the interval 20-45° and farthest 

out in the interval -10
o
 to +20
o
.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refining disc segment intended for
a disc refiner for defibering and processing
lignocellulose-containing
fiber material.
Such a refining segment is known from US-A-1114339.The pulp is produced in a refiner comprising two opposed
refining discs, at least one of which is rotary. The material
is supplied centrally through one of the discs and disintegrated
in the refining gap between the discs in the presence of water.
The refining discs are provided with a plurality of exchangeable
refining segments in the shape of a circle sector and formed
with a refining surface, which is provided with elevations
in the form of bars and intermediate grooves. The bars extend
across substantially the entire refining surface. The direction
of the bars can be radial or oblique in relation to the
radius.The fiber material is first defibered in the refining gap
between the refining surfaces, i.e. the fibers are separated.
This takes place in the inner portion of the refining gap
where the distance between the refining surfaces is the
greatest. The refining gap thereafter decreases outward in
size so as to bring about the desired processing of the
fiber material. For achieving this processing, great energy
amounts are required. Simultaneously great amounts of steam
are generated by the water following long.Depending on the desired processing degree, and thereby on
the pulp quality, the refining surfaces are designed in
various ways. The pulp quality is affected also by other
factors, such as the size of the refining gap, the liquid
content in the fiber material, the feed, temperature, etc. The appearance of the refining surface is of great importance
especially with regard to the fiber length of the processed
fiber material. When the bars are oriented substantially
radially on the refining surface, a large proportion of long
and well fibrillated fibers are obtained in the pulp.
This can be explained by the fact that the fiber material
in the refining gap orientates itself with the fiber direction
substantially in parallel with the edges of the bars.
The defibering and processing then takes place in such a way,
that the fiber material substantially is rolled between
the bars on opposed refining surfaces whereby the fibers
are separated and fibrillated in their entire length.
This type of pulp has a high strength and thereby is particularly
valuable in many connections, e.g. for newsprint. The
energy consumption at the production of this type of pulp
is relatively high.When the bars are oriented

A refining disc segment intended for a disc refiner for
defibering and processing lignocellulose-containing fiber

material, which segment has the shape of a circle sector and
is formed with a refining surface provided with elevations in

the form of bars and intermediate grooves, which extend across
substantially the entire refining surface, which refining

surface is divided into at least three radial zones (A,B,C),
each comprising one or several groups of bars where the bars

in each group substantially are in mutual parallel relationship
wherein the angle of the bars in relation to the radius

is greatest closest to the centre and thereafter decreases in
radial outward direction,

all bars are oblique in relation to the radius of the
refining segment and the angle decreases from zone to

zone whereby the angle in the zone (A) closest to the centre
is in the interval +20° to +45°, in the zone (C) farthest out in

the interval -10° to +20° and in an intermediate zone (B) in an
interval +10° to +30°.
