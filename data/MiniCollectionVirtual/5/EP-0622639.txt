<ABSTRACT>
A meteorological workstation provides for editing of 
raw data at its input by providing intelligent control 

of extraction of data from one or more data streams of 
collected weather data. Commands by the operator to the 

graphics processing of a weather forecasting and 
numerical modelling application cause the generation of 

commands to a dedicated processor controlling 
acceptance or extraction of data. Thus, data to 

be processed is limited, at any given time, to the 
data actually needed by the meteorological 

workstation under user control and has the effect 
of allowing the workstation user to control the 

source of the data being collected. Intelligent 
direction of the selected data also allows the 

formation of messages and the issuance of 
advisories and warnings even when the workstation 

is unattended.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to data
processing workstations and, more particularly, to
workstations for performing analyses and reports
concerning meteorological and/or hydrological data.Meteorological and hydrological information
is of vital importance to many individuals and
industries throughout the world; agriculture and
aviation being particularly evident examples.
Additionally, the accurate and timely distribution
of such information to the public may allow
individuals or organizations to avoid potentially
catastrophic damage due to weather and water
conditions.Especially in recent years, numerous
atmospheric phenomena have been detected, observed
and modelled, such as highly dangerous and
destructive "micro bursts", which were previously
unobserved or dismissed as anomalous but have
recently been determined to have caused several
aircraft crashes and damage to building
structures. Such detection, observation and
modelling has been made possible through recent
improvements in atmospheric observation
technology, such as Doppler radar which has the
capacity to observe wind shear. This technical capability and the potential
benefits in avoiding loss of life or property has
resulted in a worldwide upgrade of meteorological
data gathering facilities. This, in turn, has
resulted in a proliferation of data to be analyzed
in order to provide prediction of weather from
current conditions and historical precedent.
Facilities for collection and communication of
meteorological and hydrological information exist
and are readily accessible through several
commercial services such as from satellite image
services, individual radar installations, the
National Weather Service radar mosaic, networks of
local weather stations (each station providing a
so-called "station profile" including temperature,
precipitation, barometric pressure, wind speed and
direction, etc.), and the like. Each of these
services, at the present time, provides for data
collection and downloading to a database,
processing of the data, and transmission of the
processed data at predetermined intervals (e.g.
each half hour) for large areas of the world such
as a hemisphere in satellite imagery or the
entirety of North America in radar mosaics.Further, while the recent improvements in
meteorological observation technology has provided
a substantial increase in the amount of data which
may be accessed, the processing time has been
increased and the timeliness of data reporting has
been degraded. As an example of the volume of
data
