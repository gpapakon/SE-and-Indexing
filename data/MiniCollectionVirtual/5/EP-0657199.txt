<ABSTRACT>
A heater module (10) for heating a flow of fluid employs a base 
member and a cap (16) molded from polymeric material, defining 

a cavity. First (70) and second (80) flow distributor plates composed 
of electrically and thermally conductive material are positioned in the 

cavity creating multi-tier first (37), second (66) and third (64) flow 
paths. A pair of PTC pills (12) mounted between the distributor plates 

(70,80) heat the distributor plates. The fluid is heated by contact with 
the PTC piles (12) and the distributor plates (70,80) as it passes through 

the first (37), second (66) and third (64) flow paths. A weir 
maintains a fluid level in the module to ensure that the PTC pills (12) are 

always covered by fluid. A dam splits the flow and directs it 
toward the PTC pills (12) after which the flow recombines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices for filtering and 
separating liquids. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
filters for heating fuel of the fuel supply system or lubricating oil of an 
internal combustion engine and removing foreign particles and 
separating water therefrom. The absence of high standards of quality control in diesel fuel 
supplies dictates that an effective fuel filter be incorporated into the fuel 
supply system of a diesel engine. It is not uncommon for diesel fuel to 
have significant quantities of abrasive particles and water. The abrasive 
particles present the potential for permanent damage to components of 
the fuel injection pump. The abrasive particles can also adversely affect 
the performance of the pump by destroying the ability of the fuel 
injection pump to precisely meter and deliver fuel at high pressures. 
The presence of water in the diesel fuel supply can cause corrosion of 
engine components, and during freezing conditions, can result in 
interruption of the fuel injection system and/or seizure of moving 
components. Similarly, water and particulate matter in the lubricating 
oil must be removed to minimize wear of engine parts. Commonly, filters employ a disposable filter cartridge which is 
replaced at pre-established intervals of filter usage. The cartridge is 
secured to a base assembly that is fixedly mounted to the engine header 
or some other fixed location. A heater in the fuel path of the base 
warms the fuel before it enters the cartridge. These and other filtering devices which include heating elements 
require positive control of the heater element, either by a relatively 
simple thermal switch, or by a complex electronic control system. On 
warm days or after sustained engine operation, substantially less  
 
heating of the fuel is required than during start-up on days when the 
ambient temperature is, for example, 30 degrees below zero F. Current filter assemblies to which the invention relates tend to 
heat the fluid in a non-uniform manner as it flows through the base. 
That portion of the fluid that comes into direct or close contact with the 
heater may be overheated. This heated fluid releases a portion of the 
heat to the remaining fluid flow as the fluid streams are mixed. 
Incomplete mixing of the relatively heated and unheated portions of the 
fluid flow result in non-uniform heating of the fluid. U.S. Patent No. 4,976,852 and U.S. Patent No. 5,084,170, 
which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention,
