<ABSTRACT>
This process consists, starting with a mixture of papers wherein at least a proportion contains long fibres, in grinding and diluting these papers in water in order to obtain a pulp of low concentration, of the order of 1 %, in performing a first deinking operation on this pulp in accordance with a conventional technique, for example by the application of foaming agents at a basic pH, in densifying the pulp to a concentration of 30 to 40 %, in introducing this pulp into a reactor in the presence of ozone, at acidic pH, in diluting the pulp and in passing it over a washer filter at which the ink is recovered in the form of curd.

Process for de-inking waste paper, which consists in
starting from a mixture of papers, at least part of which

contains long fibres, in pounding and diluting these papers
in water in order to obtain a pulp of low concentration, of

the order of 1%, in carrying out a first de-inking
operation on this pulp in accordance with a traditional

technique, for example by utilising foaming agents under a
basic pH, in thickening the pulp to a concentration of 30

to 40%, characterised in that the pulp is introduced into a
reactor in the presence of ozone at acid pH, the reaction

of the mixture of papers in pulp form with the ozone being
carried out at a temperature of the order of 30 to 40Â°C at

a pH of the order of 3, in diluting the pulp and in passing
it over a washing filter, at the level of which the ink is

recovered in the form of curds.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that it
consists in utilising at least 10% by weight of the mixture

of papers, in the form of papers with long fibres, such as
packaging bags or corrugated cardboard.
Process according to any one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that it consists in utilising a mixture of

papers of which at least some comprise unbleached long
fibres containing lignin.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the mixture of papers contains about

one third old newspapers, one third magazines or
illustrated magazines, and one third packaging bags or

corrugated cardboard.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that, at
the time of the reaction of the mixture of papers in pulp

form with ozone, the pH is lowered to the desired value by
the addition of sulphuric acid. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that, with a view to the reaction of the

mixture of papers in pulp form with ozone, the ozone is
introduced into the reactor in a mixture with oxygen.
