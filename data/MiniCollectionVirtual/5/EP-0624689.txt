<ABSTRACT>
Rail-grinding machine capable of travelling on a track and intended for the abrasive removal of deformations or burrs on the inside of the rail heads and also for the reprofiling of the rail-head region by polygonal grinding, consisting of a platform, formed from longitudinal beams and transverse members and having guide rollers which are guided on the rails of the track, and of preferably two grinding modules which are arranged one behind the other in the travelling direction, are connected to the platform and are substantially structurally identical, characterised by the features   (a) the grinding modules (7a, 7b) are releasably mounted on the platform (10), (b) each grinding module (7a, 7b) has a frame (15) with a feed slide (46) arranged therein so as to be adjustable horizontally transversely to the longitudinal direction of the rails, (c) the feed slide (46) has a lift (28) adjustable vertically with respect to the longitudinal direction of the rails, (d) in the lift (28), a pivoting bracket (26) is mounted so as to be pivotable about a pivoting axis (29) arranged longitudinally with respect to the longitudinal direction of the rails, (e) a motor-driven grinding device (22) is arranged on the pivoting bracket (26).
