<ABSTRACT>
The invention is characterised in that material to be cleaned is heated in a process chamber under vacuum conditions in such a way that the greases and/or oils, depending on their physical state, can easily be separated from the material. In a first cleaning step, the greases and/or oils adhering to the material to be cleaned are impinged by a solvent similar to their consistency and the mixture forming of solvent and detached greases or oils is fed to a vaporizer. In a second cleaning step, the vapour forming at the vaporizer is passed to the material, the vapour condenses on the surface thereof and the residual contamination is removed in the condensate formation. In a third cleaning step, the vapour is fed to a condenser, the condensate produced therefrom is fed back to the cleaning process as a solvent and in a fourth cleaning step, the vacuum chamber is again evacuated in such a manner that remaining solvent vapours are completely removed.

Method of gently degreasing and cleaning a product polluted 
with grease- and/or oil-containing substances, characterized 

by the combination of the following features: 

the metal components, granulates, sands or dusts (1) to 
be cleaned are inserted into a vacuum chamber (5), 
in a first cleaning step, the greases and/or oils 
clinging to the product (1) to be cleaned are acted upon 

by a solvent, of similar consistency, of an identicaltype, 
highly volatile fraction of the lubricant, 

preferably however paraffin oil and/or kerosene, and the 
mixture of solvent and dissolved greases and/or oils 

which forms is supplied to an evaporator (14), 
in a second cleaning step, the vapour which forms at the 
evaporator (14) is fed through a vapour pressure line 

(13) to the product (1), at the surface of which the 
vapour condenses and while forming a condensate removes 

the residual pollution, 
in a third cleaning step, the vapour is fed into a 
condenser (6), the recovered condensate of which is 

resupplied as a solvent to the cleaning process, and 
in a fourth cleaning step, the vacuum chamber (5) is 
further evacuated in such a way that residual solvent 

vapours are completely removed through an extraction line 
(12) and recycled by means of heated condensers (6', 6") 

connected in each case downstream of the vacuum pumps 
(7, 8).
