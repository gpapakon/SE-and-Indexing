<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a component (40) by depositing a first layer of a powder material from a dispersing head (41) in a confined region (42) and then depositing a binder material (43) to selected regions of the layer of powder material to produce a layer of bonded powder material at the selected regions. Such steps are repeated a selected number of times to produce successive layers of selected regions of bonded powder material so as to form the desired component. The unbonded powder material is then removed. In some cases the component may be further processed by heating it to further strengthen the bonding thereof. An apparatus for carrying out the process is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the manufacture
of tooling and prototype parts and, more particularly, to
the use of three-dimensional printing techniques using
computer models therefor.Two needs in providing effective industrial
productivity and competitiveness lie in the reduction in
time required to bring new products to the marketplace
and the need for providing for flexible manufacture of
products in small quantities. Thus, it is desirable to
provide rapid part turnaround with a minimal investment
in tooling. Techniques for doing so should have the
ability to tailor designs to specfic tasks, to shorten
the cycle time from design to manufacturing, and/or to
manufacture in very small lot sizes, as low as a single
component, all at reasonable cost. A major contributor
to the time required to bring new products to market is
the time required to fabricate functioning prototypes.
Rapid prototyping can shorten the product development
cycle and improve the design process by providing rapid
and effective feedback to the designer. Moreover, some
applications require rapid prototyping of non-functional
parts for use in assessing the aesthetic aspects of a 
design or the fit and assembly thereof.Another major contributor to the time to bring a
product to market is the time required to develop
tooling, such as molds and dies. For some types of
tooling, such as injection molding dies, the turnaround
time for the design and fabrication of a tool routinely
extends to several months. The long lead times are due
to the fact that tooling is often one of a kind and can
be extremely complex, requiring a great deal of human
attention to detail. Thus, tooling not only affects lead
time, but also manufacturing costs as well. In fact,
tooling costs often determine the minimum economic batch
size for a given process. Prototyping requirements,
tooling lead time, and tooling cost are related in that
it is the combination of long lead times and high cost
which make it impractical to fabricate preproduction
prototypes by the same process that will be used in
production.In the past several years, there has been
considerable interest in developing computerized, three-dimensional
printing techniques, sometimes referred to as
"desktop manufacturing"techniques where no tooling is
required. One such system is known, the SLA 1 System,
made and sold by 3D Systems, Inc. of Valencia,
California. This system operates on a principle called
stereolithography wherein a focused ultra-violet (UV)
laser is vector scanned over the top of a
