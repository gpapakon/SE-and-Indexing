<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a superconducting 
device, and more particularly to an anisotropic 
superconducting device that uses an oxide superconductor 
having a high superconducting critical temperature that 
exceeds the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Advances in thin film fabrication technology and 
high precision microfabrication technology have produced a 
rapid increase in research on electronic devices that use 
the class of oxide superconductors referred to as high-temperature 
superconductors, meaning superconductors that 
have a high superconducting critical temperature. However, 
there is still a lack of knowledge when it comes to 
computer devices, especially electronic devices used mainly 
for digital applications. In the case of junction type or 
multi-layer type devices which consist of a barrier layer 
formed between two superconductor layers, a stable, highly 
reliable device, such as a lead or niobium based Josephson 
switching device for use at ultralow temperatures, has not 
been obtained. As junction devices that use high-temperature 
superconductors, there can be considered a superconductor-normal  
 
(i.e., ordinary metal) conductor-superconductor (SNS) 
junction device or a superconductor-insulator-superconductor 
(SIS) junction device. However, a problem that does not 
arise in the case of a conventional metallic superconductor 
but does arise in the case of high-temperature 
superconductors it that of the anisotropy of the 
superconductive properties (such as coherence length, 
magnetic field penetration depth and energy gap) produced 
by the crystal orientation. For example, the coherence 
length of a film of YBaCuO, a high-temperature oxide 
superconductor, is several tenths of a nanometer along the 
c axis and several nanometers in the Cu-O plane along which 
most of the superconducting electrons pass. Thus, compared 
to a metallic superconductor the coherence length of a high-temperature 
superconductor is shorter and anisotropic, and 
according to the accepted thinking this forms an obstacle, 
especially with respect to the realization of an SIS device. 
A study of YBaCuO films including their anisotropy has been 
reported in Sverkhprovodimost': Fizika, Khimiya, Tekhnika, 
April 1990, USSR, Vol. 3, Nr. 4, pp. 658-667 or Supercond. 
Phys. Chem. Technol., Vol. 3, Nr. 4, pp. 623-631, April

superconductor separated by a barrier layer of PrBaCuO,
