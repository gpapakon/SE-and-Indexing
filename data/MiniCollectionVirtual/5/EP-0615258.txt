<ABSTRACT>
The present invention aims at providing a solid insulator 
of a high strength, and a method of manufacturing the 

same. The solid insulator is characterized in that it consists 
of porcelain in which the quantity of crystals of cristobalite 

is not more than 10 %, an internal strain in the direction of 
compression in a columnar insulator body being larger in 

the diametrically inner portion thereof than in the diametrically 
outer portion thereof, the difference Y between the internal 

strain in the outer circumferential portion of the insulator 
body and that in the diametrically central portion 

thereof 

Y ≧ (1.76 x 10⁻⁶)X 
 
, wherein X(mm) represents 

the diameter of the insulator body. A method of manufacturing 
such a solid insulator is characterized in that a 

sintered insulator is quenched so as to increase the difference 
between the internal strain in the inner portion of 

the insulator and that in the outer portion thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid insulator and
a method of manufacturing the same.In the technical field of solid insulators,
there have been developed a solid insulator made of
cristobalite porcelain containing cristobalite crystals, a
solid insulator made of non-cristobalite porcelain without
any cristobalite crystal, and the like. In these solid
insulators, high mechanical strength and electrical
strength are required.GB-A- 1 103 147 describes porcelain insulators having a
columnar shape containing 15 to 36% cristobalite in the porcelain body.The solid insulator made of cristobalite porcelain
containing cristobalite crystals in an amount of more
than 20 wt% is superior in strength to a solid insulator
made of cristobalite porcelain containing cristobalite
crystals in an amount of less than 10 wt%, or a solid
insulator made of non-cristobalite porcelain.
From the manufacturing point of view, however, the
solid insulator made of non-cristobalite porcelain is
superior to the solid insulator containing more than 20% cristobalite since the sintering 
temperature can be easily controlled in a wide range during
the firing process.A method for increasing strength of insulators is
disclosed on pages 1260 to 1261 of "Ceramics Industry
Engineering Handbook" issued by Gihodo, February 15, 1971.
In such a method for increasing strength of insulators, a
raw material easier for forming cristobalite crystals is
used as a raw material of the insulator body, and a firing
condition easier for forming the cristobalite crystals is
adapted to increase the thermal expansion coefficient of
the insulator body more than that of a glaze layer on the
surface of the insulator during the sintering process
thereby to cause compressive stress in the glaze layer
during the cooling process for increasing the tensile
stress and bending strength of the insulator by 10 to 40%.In the solid insulator made of cristobalite porcelain
containing cristobalite crystals in an amount of more than
20 wt%, the foregoing method is useful for increasing the
thermal expansion coefficient of the insulator body during
the sintering process. In the solid insulator containing
cristobalite crystals in an amount of less than 10 wt % or
the solid insulator made of non-cristobalite porcelain,
however, the thermal expansion coefficient of the insulator
body may not be increased during the firing process. It 
is, therefore, difficult to adjust the thermal expansion
coefficient of glaze for increasing a difference in thermal
expansion coefficient between
