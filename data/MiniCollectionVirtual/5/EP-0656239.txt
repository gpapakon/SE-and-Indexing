<ABSTRACT>
The method makes it possible to machine workpieces made of titanium and titanium alloys with cutting speeds of the order of 150 m/min, for a material throughput rate identical to that previously obtained at 60 m/min. Spraying of lubricating fluid under very high pressures (60 to 400 bar) is employed. The main element is a spray clamp (2) comprising internal ducts (5, 6) making it possible to convey one or more jets of fluid under very high pressures towards the cutting edge (9) of the machining tip (insert) (10). Application to the machining of components forming part of turbojets.

Method of machining components made of titanium
and titanium alloys by means of tungsten-carbide tips,

including

the fixing of a spraying flange (2) onto a
tool holder (1), the flange (2) being equipped with two

communicating ducts (5, 6), the final duct (6) opening
out along an axis (6A) oriented exactly onto the cutting

edge (9, 13) of the tip (10, 12), the fixing means
(3) providing a leaktight support between the faces of

the flange (2) and of the tool holder (1), the diameter
of the first duct (5) being larger than the diameter of

the final duct (6), the said diameters being respectively
constant and linked by a reduction cone with

conicity of less than 45 degrees, the length L of the
final duct (6) lying between 6d and 10d, d being its

diameter,
the supply of lubrication fluid at high pressure,
between 60 and 400 bar, to the said ducts (5, 6)

in such a way as to direct at least one jet of fluid
exactly above the cutting edge (9, 13) of the tip (10,

12), the distance (D) existing between the end (6E) of
the final duct (6) and the cutting edge (9, 13) lying

between 4 and 12 mm, and the angle of inclination (I)
of the axis (6A) of the jet with the plane of the cutting

face (8) of the machining tip (10, 12) lies between
0 and 30 degrees,
the machining of the component, using a cutting
speed higher than 150 m per minute.
