<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to the use of
thrombin in a medical procedure in an animal. More
specifically, the subject invention relates to such
use of thrombin wherein the thrombin is a thrombin
blood fraction, as defined hereinbelow.One mechanism for hemostasis, i.e.,
prevention of blood loss, of an animal is the
formation of a blood clot. Clot formation, i.e.,
blood coagulation, occurs by means of a complex
cascade of reactions with the final steps being the
conversion of fibrinogen by thrombin, calcium ions and
activated factor XIII to form the fibrin clot. For a
review of the mechanisms of blood coagulation and the
structure of fibrinogen, see C.M. Jackson, Ann. Rev.
Biochem., 49:765-811 (1980) and B. Furie and B.C.
Furie, Cell, 53:505-518 (1988).Thrombin, which is a proteolytic enzyme, is
derived from prothrombin. Prothrombin is converted to
thrombin by calcium and prothrombinase.
Prothrombinase is formed through a cascade of
reactions that begins with the proteins factor XI and
factor XII.A fibrin sealant is a biological adhesive
whose effect imitates the final stages of coagulation,
thereby resulting in a fibrin clot. Conventional
fibrin sealants generally consist of concentrated
human fibrinogen, bovine aprotinin and factor XIII, as
the first component and bovine thrombin and calcium
chloride as the second component. Application is
generally carried out with a double-barrelled syringe, 
which permits simultaneous application of both
components to the site where one wants to form the
fibrin clot. Aprotinin is a fibrinolytic inhibitor
added to promote stability of fibrin sealants.The fibrinogen component of the fibrin
sealant is prepared from pooled human plasma. The
fibrinogen can be concentrated from the human plasma
by cryoprecipitation and precipitation using various
reagents, e.g., polyethylene glycol, ether, ethanol,
ammonium sulfate or glycine. For an excellent review
of fibrin sealants, see M. Brennan, Blood Reviews,
5:240-244 (1991); J.W. Gibble and P.N. Ness,
Transfusion, 30:741-747 (1990); H. Matras, J. Oral
Maxillofac surg., 43:605-611 (1985) and R. Lerner and
N. Binur, J. of Surgical Research, 48:165-181 (1990).Recently, there has also been an interest in
the preparation of fibrin sealants that utilize
autologous fibrin. An autologous fibrin sealant is a
fibrin sealant wherein the fibrinogen component of the
fibrin sealant is extracted from the patients own
blood. The use of an autologous fibrin sealant is
preferred because it eliminates the risk of
transmission of

<CLAIMS>
A two component fibrin sealant for use in a medical procedure on a human or
animal, the sealant comprising a fibrinogen fraction in which the fibrinogen is recovered

only from said human or animal, and a thrombin blood fraction having a specific activity of
thrombin of from 1NIH to 200 NIH units per mg. of total blood protein and a thrombin

concentration of from 1 NIH unit/ml to 2000 NIHuits/ml also recovered only from said
same human or animal, said thrombin blood fraction being substantially free of active

antithrombin III.
A fibrin sealant according to Claim 1, for use in a medical procedure on a human,
the sealant comprising a fibrinogen fraction in which the fibrinogen is recovered only from

said human, and a thrombin blood fraction also recovered only from said same human.
A fibrin sealant according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said thrombin blood
fraction is prepared by subjecting donor plasma from said human or animal to precipitation

to form a fibrinogen-containing precipitate and a supernatant, and converting the fibrinogen
in the precipitate to fibrin.
A fibrin sealant according to any preceding claim, wherein said thrombin blood
fraction has a specific activity of thrombin of from 5 NIH units to 100 NIH units per mg. of

total blood protein. 
A fibrin sealant according to any preceding claim, wherein said thrombin blood
fraction has a specific activity of thrombin of from 5 NIH to 50 NIH units per mg. of total

blood protein.
A method for preparing a fibrin sealant for use in a medical procedure on a human
or animal, the fibrin sealant comprising a fibrinogen fraction and a thrombin blood fraction

having a specific activity of thrombin of from 1 NIH unit to 200 NIH units per mg. of total
blood protein and a thrombin concentration of from 1 NIH unit/ml to 2000 NIH units/ml,

which is substantially free of active antithrombin III, the method comprising the steps of
recovering the fibrinogen and the thrombin blood fraction from the human or animal so that

the fibrin sealant is autologous.
The method according to Claim 6, wherein the step of recovering the thrombin
blood fraction comprises the steps of:


diluting whole blood to an ionic strength of less than 100 millimolar;
separating plasma from the whole blood;
lowering the pH of the plasma to precipitate a prothrombin blood fraction;
separating the prothrombin blood from the plasma; and
converting the prothrombin in the prothrombin blood fraction to thrombin to
prepare the thrombin blood fraction.
The method according to Claim 6 or 7, further comprising the step of substantially
removing any fibrinogen which may be contained in, or formed in, the thrombin fraction. 
The method according to any of Claims 6 to 8, wherein fibrin sealant is for use in a
medical procedure on a human and the fibrinogen and the thrombin blood fraction are

recovered from the human.
The method according to any of Claims 6 to 9, wherein said thrombin blood fraction
has a specific activity of thrombin of from about 5 NIH units to about 100 NIH units per

mg. of total blood protein.
The method according to any of Claims 6 to 10, wherein said thrombin blood
fraction has a specific activity of thrombin of from 5 NIH units to 50 NIH units per mg. of

total blood protein.
