<ABSTRACT>
An effector (1) for engaging underwater targets (8) is intended to determine after being launched the azimuth position and submersion depth of the target while sinking in the water, by omnidirectional direction finding. To this end, the active body radiates acoustic waves in all directions in the form of a flat transmission polar diagram in the form of a disc. The respective direction of the returning echo signals is determined with the aid of directionally sensitive receiving transducers (13). The reception polar diagrams preferably consist of four reception lobes which are flat and overlap one another in the azimuth direction. The respective height of the effector is measured by means of an echo sounder (6) which is installed in the front end of the active body, and is associated with the received echo signals. During the subsequent target tracking phase, the echo sounder at the front end is used as a target tracking sonar. The disc-shaped transmission polar diagram is likewise approximated to by means of four mutually overlapping radiation polar diagrams in the form of broad, flat lobes whose main radiation axes are offset through an angle of 45 DEG  with respect to those of the reception lobes.

An electro acoustic under-water direction finder including a preferably cylindrical carrier,
sinking down in the body of water and carrying transducers (22, 23), which transmit and receive,

respectively, direction finding signals travelling radially with respect to the sinking axis and
essentially in parallel to the water surface, which transducers are provided at regular azimuth

angular distances around the circumference of said carrier (1);
characterized in that
a) each group of transmitting transducers (22) transmits a sound lobe (15) which is flat in its
vertical direction;
b) the sound lobes (15a to 15d) of adjacent groups of transmitting transducers overlap each
other in circumferential direction;
c) several groups of receiving transducers (23) are provided at regular azimuth angular
distances around the circumference of said carrier, with the receiving diagrams (13) of said

transducers being shaped in vertical direction as flat receiving lobes (13a to 13d);
d) the receiving lobes (13) of adjacent transducer groups (13a to 13d) overlap each other in
circumferential direction; and
e) said groups of transmitting transducers (22) are angularily offset in circumferential
direction such that the angular offset between said groups of receiving transducers (23) and

said groups of transmitting transducers (22) equals half of the angular distance between adjacent
groups of transmitting transducers.

of transmitting transducers and/or each group (23) of receiving transducers includes at least one

row of several individual transducers.
The direction finder of one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that each group (23) of receiving

transducers consists of a strip of piezoresistive or piezoelectric matarial, preferably of
polyvinylidenflouride PVDF or PVF

direction the groups (22) of transmitting transducers are located ahead of the group (23) of

receiving transducers.

transducer array (21) is provided at the front side of said carrier (1) and can be used as a target

tracking sonar or as an echo sounding equipment.
The direction finder of claim 8, characterized in that the front side transducers (21) serve as
passive pressure probes when entering the body of water and/or when touching the target, and

then generate electrical pulse signals.
