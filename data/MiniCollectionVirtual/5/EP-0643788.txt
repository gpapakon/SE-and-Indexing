System for relining conveyor ducts such as 
pipelines (1) with an inner inliner (2) and an outer 

inliner (preliner 7), 

wherein, after insertion in the outer inliner 
(preliner 7), the inner inliner (2) forms an 

inherently rigid inner tube (38) and 
wherein the outer inliner (preliner 7) is so 
arranged with a clearance from the inner 

inliner (2) that an open flow cross-section 
between the inner and the outer inliners is 

formed as control chamber (9) for detecting 
and possibly eliminating leaks in one of the 

inliners. 
System for the relining of conveyor ducts such as 
pipelines (1) with an inner inliner (2), an 

intermediate inliner (3) and an outer inliner (preliner 
7), 


wherein the inner inliner (2) together with 
the intermediate inliner (3) forms an 

inherently rigid inner tube (38) after the 
insertion in the outer inliner and 
wherein the outer inliner (preliner 7) is so 
arranged with a clearance from the 

intermediate inliner (3) that an open flow 
cross-section between the intermediate and 

the outer inliners is formed as control 
chamber (9) for detecting and possibly 

eliminating leaks in one of the inliners. 
System according to one of claims 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 the distance between the outer 
liner (preliner 7) and the intermediate or inner  

 
inliner respectively is fixed by means of knobs (8) on 

the inside of the outer or on the outside of the 
intermediate or inner inliner respectively. 
Method for relining of conveyor ducts like 
pipelines (1) with an inner inliner (2) and an outer 

inliner (preliner 7) 

wherein, after insertion in the outer 
inliner, the inner inliner (2) forms an 

inherently rigid inner tube (38) and 
wherein the outer inliner (preliner 7) is so 
arranged with a clearance from the inner 

inliner (2) that an open flow cross-section 
is formed between the inner and the outer 

inliner as control chamber (9) for detecting 
and possibly eliminating leaks in one of the 

inliners. 
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 
the inner inliner (2) consists of thermoplastic 

plastics and is softened by heating before or after the 
insertion in the outer inliner (preliner 7). 
Method for relining conveyor ducts such as 
pipelines (1) with an inner inliner (2), an 

intermediate inliner (3) and an outer inliner (preliner 
7), 


wherein the inner inliner (2) forms together 
with the intermediate inliner (3), after 

insertion in the outer inliner (preliner 7), 
an inherently rigid inner tube (39) and 
wherein the outer inliner (preliner 7) is 
arranged with a clearance from the 

intermediate inliner (3) so that an open flow 
cross-section between the intermediate and 

outer inliners is formed as control chamber  
 

(9) for detecting and possibly eliminating 
leaks in one of the inliners. 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 
there is used as the inner inliner (2) a tube which has 

on its subsequent outside a fleece provided with a 
hardenable resin which is hardened after insertion 

inside the intermediate inliner (3). 
Method according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 
the inner inliner (2) has on its outside means (knobs 

4) for fixing a distance between the intermediate and 
inner inliners, whereby a free annular chamber (5) is 

formed between and the intermediate and inner inliners 
and that a hardenable medium (mortar 6) is introduced 

between the intermediate and the inner inliners and is 
hardened. 
Method according to one of claims 4 to 8, 

characterised in that
 one of the inliners used has a 
metal foil (10) as diffusion or permeation barrier for 

chlorinated hydrocarbons. 
Method according to one of claims 4 to 9, 

characterised in that
 the inliners used are inserted 
one after another into the pipeline to be restored 

through shaft construction (14) which is provided.
