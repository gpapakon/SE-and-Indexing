<ABSTRACT>
A mixer system for aggressive materials which are mixed in a vessel (12) with an impeller (14) connected to a drive shaft (16) mounted to an assembly (18) which covers the opening of the tank and seals the outside environment from the interior of the vessel by a magnetic coupling (26). The drive shaft (16) is mounted within a bearing assembly (20, 22) made up of silicon nitride coated balls (76) and coated races (78, 80, 82, 84) selected from the group of chromium zirconium/zirconium nitride on the exposed surfaces of the race.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mixer
systems, by which is meant systems for
suspending, agitating and/or circulating
materials, particularly liquids or liquid
suspensions and particularly to mixer systems
for mixing aggressive materials, by which is
meant toxic, hazardous, corrosive or other
materials which need to be confined for proper
handling, processing or for environmental safety
or health reasons.In order to prevent the escape of
aggressive materials from the vessel in which
they are mixed, confinement of the mixing
apparatus which contacts the material has
necessitated the use of magnet couplings which
provide confinement shells or which use the wall
of the vessel to separate the driven impeller
apparatus from the motor and other drive
elements. The spacing of the impeller and other
parts of its drive apparatus, for example the
impeller shaft, as well as the rotor of the
magnet coupling with respect to the confinement
shell or the other separating member (the wall
of the tank) has necessitated the use of
bearings which control the run out of the shaft 
and the impeller so that there is no
interference with the confinement shell. The
conventional approach has been to protect the
bearings and to provide dynamic, running seals
which prevent the aggressive materials from
leaking into regions where the bearings are
located. Such seals are undesirable since they
have limited lifetimes and must be replaced
before failure. The life of the seals is also
subject to reduction because they are exposed to
the aggressive material.It is a feature of this invention to
eliminate such seals thereby effectively
providing a sealless mixer system. Instead of
resorting to seals, the bearings themselves are
made, or at least surfaced, with material
resistant to the aggressive material being
mixed. The invention, contrary to the
conventional technology, uses bearings or
journals for the impeller shaft which are
confined with the aggressive material.
Notwithstanding, the conventional technology it
has been found in accordance with the invention
that mixer systems having acceptable lifetimes,
in spite of their use with aggressive materials,
are not only possible but practicable.It is necessary in accordance with
certain processing techniques, for example when
the aggressive material is altered from one type
of material to another or has different
ingredients thereto and proportions are critical
or the presence of materials previously being
mixed is detrimental to the process, that all or
part of the region which is

<CLAIMS>
A mixer for mixing aggressive material in a vessel (12) having an
opening to receive part of said mixer, said mixer including an impeller (14), a drive

shaft (16,182) for rotatably supporting said impeller, an assembly (18) including a
casing which accommodates said drive shaft and defines a confinement region, and

bearings (20-22, 178-180, 232-234) rotatably supporting said drive shaft,
said assembly defines an open passageway (70) that opens into the interior of

the vessel and extends around a periphery of the drive shaft, between the periphery and
inner walls of the casing, characterized by said bearings being disposed in the passageway and

permitting the aggressive material to pass therethrough whereby upon agitation of said
impeller said aggressive material entering the passageway from the vessel passes

through said bearings in the confinement region, said bearings having surfaces resistant
to said aggressive material.
The mixer according to claim 1, wherein said bearings are dry running
ball bearings (20-22) with silicon nitride balls (74,76) and the races (78-80, 82,84) of

said bearings have a layer of material, selected from the group consisting of chromium
chromium/zirconium/zirconium nitride, on the exposed surfaces thereof.
The mixer according to claim 1, wherein said bearings are journal
bearings (232-234) and a thrust bearing (238) spaced from each other and disposed

around said shaft (16).
The mixer according to claim 1, further including in said assembly
around said shaft (16) an expandable collar (100,144,206) providing a static seal across

said passageway (70) when expanded radially about said shaft when said shaft is
stationary.
The mixer according to claim 4, wherein said bearings (178,180) are

an end of said passageway (70) which is open to said vessel, said expandable collar
(266) is spaced away from the one of said positions further from said open end of said

bore (70) defining part of said passageway and through which said shaft extends and 

along which said bearings are disposed in axially spaced relationship, a collar (206)

facing away from and toward said open end of said passageway, a flange (200)
extending radially outward from said shaft and having a rim and opposite side surfaces

said side
surface of said flange facing said open end of said passageway defining a position for

counteracting said bias to enable forming of a seal with said seal member when the
pressure in said passageway exposed to said one side surface of said flange is less than

passageway.
