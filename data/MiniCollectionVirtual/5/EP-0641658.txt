<ABSTRACT>
A substrate for a recording head has a plurality 
of recording elements (1005), a plurality of 

functional elements (1015, 1016) electrically 
connected to the recording elements (1005), and a 

common electrode (1014) electrically connected to 
the recording elements (1005) and selectively 

feeding a driving signal to the recording elements 
(1005) on a base boad (1003). Also, the common 

electrode (1014) is prepared as a layer by the same 
step as that of forming a conductor electrode layer 

to be electrically connected to a semiconductor 
layer constituting the functional elements arranged 

in the substrate. Therefore, the recording 
apparatus can be prepared by the process including 

the step of forming the recording elements and 
simultaneously connecting these elements to reduce 

the number of film forming operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
substrate of a recording head for recording inputted
information such as characters, figures or the like,
a recording head, and a
method of producing a substrate for a recording
head. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a substrate used for an ink-jet recording
head that includes an electrical circuit for
selectively feeding a driving signal to a plurality
of recording elements arranged in a same base board.Various kinds of recording apparatuses each
having a plurality of recording elements arranged in
a row for recording characters, figures or the like
on a recording medium have been hitherto known. In
general, a recording apparatus of the foregoing type
includes recording means having a plurality of
recording elements and a driving integrated circuit
capable of simultaneously driving a predetermined
number of recording elements as a single block
mounted on a same base board. With such 
construction, it is possible to execute arbitrary
recording on a recording medium (sheet of recording
paper, cloth, sheet of plastic material or the like)
by arranging image data corresponding to the
respective recording elements. Among conventional
recording apparatuses as mentioned above, an ink jet
type recording apparatus adapted to execute
recording on a recording medium by ejecting ink from
a plurality of ejecting ports disposed on the
recording elements while generating few noisy sound
without any impact induced by each recording
operation makes it possible to perform each
recording operation not only at a high density but
also at a high speed. For this reason, a number of
ink jet type recording apparatuses are utilized for
an information processing system on the commercial
basis. In practice, the ink jet recording apparatus
is used as a printer located at an output terminal
of, e.g., a copying machine, a facsimile, a
computer, a word processor, a work station or the
like or as a handy or portable printer to be
equipped in operative association with a personal
computer, a host computer, an optical disc unit, a
video unit or the like. A conventional recording
apparatus as mentioned above includes recording
means (recording head), conveying means for
conveying a recording medium, driving means for
reciprocally displacing a recording head in the
direction at a right angle relative to the direction
of conveyance of a recording medium, and controlling
means for controlling the ejection of ink from the
recording head, the conveyance of a recording medium
and
