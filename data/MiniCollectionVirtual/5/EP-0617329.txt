<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a microstructure having higher 
aspect ratio by using a general purpose synchrotron 

orbital radiation apparatus is provided. A resist layer 
(4) mainly including a copolymer of methylmethacrylate and 

methacrylic acid is formed on a substrate (2). 
Lithography by synchrotron orbital radiation is carried 

out on the resist layer (4), to form a resist pattern. By 
carrying out normal electroplating, electroforming or the 

like in accordance with the resist pattern, a 
microstructure having high aspect ratio is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming
a micro structure and, more specifically, to an
improvement in the method of forming micro structures such
as LIGA method, improvement in the method of forming micro
structures applying patterning technique of the
semiconductor processing and the like, and to a method for forming an X-ray
mask.Recently, microprocessing technique for forming
highly miniaturized structures by making use of technique
for manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuit devices
has been studied intensively. Especially the LIGA
(Lithograph Galvanformung und Abformung) method for
forming micro structures having high aspect ratio is
attracting much attention (see Nikkei Mechanical 1990.
November 26, pp. 72-79 and Kikai Sekkei Vol. 3, No. 6
(May, 1991), pp. 26-28). The LIGA method can be applied
to manufacturing of micro machines, optical elements,
sensors, actuators and the like, and the applicable field
thereof is very wide.In the conventional LIGA method, 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is mainly used as a resist
in the step of forming a resist pattern by using X-ray
lithography.Figs. 1 to 8 are cross sections schematically showing
basic steps of the conventional LIGA method.First, in the step shown in Fig. 1, typically, a
resist layer 102 of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is
formed to a desired thickness (about several 10µm to
several 100µm) on a substrate 101. Then, an X-ray mask
100 having a desired pattern is used to expose resist
layer 102 with synchrotron orbital radiation (SOR). Then,
in the step shown in Fig. 2, resist layer 102 which has
been exposed in the step of Fig. 1 is developed to form a
resist pattern 103. In the step shown in Fig. 3,
substrate 101 having resist pattern 103 formed thereon is
dipped in a plating liquid, and Ni, Cu, Au or the like is
deposited on depressed portions of resist pattern 103 on
substrate 101 by electroplating, thus forming a metal
structure 104. In the step shown in Fig. 4, the substrate
101 and the resist are removed to obtain metal structure
104. Metal structure 104 is used as a mold, dielectric
plastic is filled in metal structure 104 by injection
molding, and thus a mold 105 of dielectric plastic is
formed. Then, in the step shown in Fig. 5, in accordance
with the mold 105 of dielectric plastic fabricated in the 
step of Fig. 4, a plastic mold 108 of dielectric plastic
106 and a conductive plastic sheet 107 is formed. Then,
in the step shown in Fig. 6, mold 105 is separated to
prepare a plastic mold 108. Then, in the step shown
