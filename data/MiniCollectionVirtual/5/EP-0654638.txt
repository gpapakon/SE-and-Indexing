<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a discharge structure for closed
gas appliances. Such discharge structures form the main
component of a roof terminal or wall terminal for, for
instance, heating boilers and comprise a line for the
supply of combustion air and a line for the exhaust of
combustion gasses. The discharge structure then further
comprises a supply means for combustion air, such as a
supply hood, forming the connection between the outside
air and the supply line for combustion air, and a flow-promoting
exhaust means for combustion gasses, such as a
draught hood, forming the connection between the combustion
gas exhaust line and the outside air. The exhaust
means is situated at a greater distance from the space in
which the gas appliance is located than the supply means,
that is to say, in a vertical arrangement of the discharge
structure, above the supply means.A discharge structure as described in the preamble of claim 1 is known from GB-A-287.335.Such a discharge structure is also referred to as a wall
or roof terminal structure. In this application, the inner
end is considered as the end which has to be connected to
the combustion air supply and the combustion gas exhaust
of the gas appliance itself, whether through the medium of
a manifold or not, with which manifold or branch pipe the
combustion gas exhaust line and the combustion air supply
line in the discharge structure, situated concentrically
relative to each other, are transformed into parallel
lines.Discharge structures are often completely adapted to the
brand and type of the gas appliance onto which they are to 
be fitted or to a certain group of gas appliances with a
defined working area or working range width. The discharge
structures are supplied in new building and renovation
projects in the composition and with the dimensions in
which they are about suitable for mounting in the work.
The various components are herein connected to each other
in a usually permanent manner in the factory, for instance
by being welded, riveted or glued, in a manner which is
usually very labour-intensive.Because the various standards may prescribe a minimum
height above the roof for the combustion gas exhaust means
and the exact position of the gas appliance below the
roof, it can be necessary that the discharge structure is
given a certain surplus length in order to, in the absence
of simple possibilities for adaptation, in the case of
deviations in measurement in the work, yet be able to fall
within these standard values or fitting measures.It is also
