<ABSTRACT>
A multistate electronic transfer standard (14) 
provides electronic conditions to at least one of two ports 

of a vector network analyzer (12). One embodiment of the 
multistate electronic transfer standard includes a plurality 

of semiconductor devices (D1-D16) interconnected by 
transmission lines (T1-T17). The semiconductor devices are 

each biased to generate different conditions at each of the 
two ports. A control computer (16) controls the biasing of 

the semiconductor devices according to a predetermined 
procedure and compares impedance values measured for at 

least one of the two ports of the network analyzer (12) to 
known values stored by the control computer (16). The 

control computer (16) thereby derives calibration coefficients 
that are used by the network analyzer (12) in performing 

further measurements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
automatically producing a plurality of complex reflection 
coefficients, a low-loss transmission coefficient, and a high 
isolation condition at the ports of a vector network analyzer. Measurement errors in any vector network analyzer (VNA) 
contribute to the uncertainty of the device being measured by 
the VNA. By quantifying these errors, their effects can be 
drastically reduced. Measurement errors in network analysis can be separated 
into two categories: random errors and systematic errors. 
Random errors are non-repeatable measurement variations due 
to physical change (e.g. noise and temperature changes) and, 
therefore, are usually unpredictable. Systematic errors are 
repeatable measurement variations in the test setup itself 
(e.g. directivity, source match, and the like). In most measurements made on "devices under test" (DUT) 
with a VNA, the systematic errors are the most significant 
source of measurement uncertainty. Therefore, it is 
desirable to remove these errors from the VNA measurements. 
This is achieved through a VNA calibration. It is known in the prior art to connect a number of 
well-known physical standards (known as mechanical primary 
standards) to each of the two ports of the VNA for the  
 
purpose of calibration. Electrical characteristics of the 
mechanical primary standards are derived from known physical 
properties of the standards (e.g. physical dimension, 
conductor material, and the like). The systematic errors of 
the VNA can be determined by computing the difference between 
the VNA measured response of the mechanical primary standards 
and the known electrical characteristics of the mechanical 
primary standards. However, before measuring the DUT, the performance of 
the calibration should be checked for its accuracy. It is, 
therefore, also common in the prior art to check the 
calibration accuracy by connecting another primary standard 
(a verification standard), which is different than that of 
the calibration standard, to the VNA. If the calibration of 
the VNA is performed properly, the measurement of the 
verification standard closely matches the known electrical 
characteristics of the verification standard. However, if 
the measurement of the verification standard does not comply 
with the known electrical characteristics of the verification 
standard, then the operator knows that the calibration was 
not performed properly, or that the VNA is not functioning 
properly. Upon completion of verification
