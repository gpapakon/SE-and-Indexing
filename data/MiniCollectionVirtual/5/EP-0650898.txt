<ABSTRACT>
A plastic container comprises a container wall (1) sealed in the 
circumferential direction as well as a lid (2) provided with a lid flange 

(5) which is welded all round to the container wall (1). This 
container wall (1) is 

provided with an essentially radial collar (4) which both permits a good 
connection with the lid flange (5) and offers a good gripping point for 

lifting equipment (10,11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plastic container comprising a 
container wall sealed in the circumferential direction as well as a lid 
provided with a lid flange which is welded all round to the container 
wall. Such a plastic container is known from EP-B-343749. The lid 
used in the latter case projects radially outwards and has a raised edge 
such that the entire vessel can be raised up by means of a special 
lifting apparatus ("parrot's beak"), which grips both under the 
projecting portion of the lid and over the edge. In the raised-up 
position, the entire container is suspended from the lid which is gripped 
in this way, which results in the weld between lid and container wall 
being severely loaded. This weld must, after all, transmit the entire 
weight of the contents of the container to the lid. The weld is also 
exposed to intermittent loads such as those which occur, for example, 
during transportation. Such a high load of the weld between lid and container wall can 
be transmitted in the correct manner only if the local stresses in the 
weld do not become too great. This means that the weld has to extend over 
a relatively large surface so that the load to be transmitted can be 
satisfactorily distributed. In the known container, such a large surface 
is not easy to achieve, given the small thickness of the container wall. 
In particular, butt-welded embodiments are disadvantageous in this case. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a container 
of the abovementioned type which does not have said disadvantage. This 
object is achieved in that the container wall is provided with an 
essentially radial collar. By choosing a sufficiently large radial 
dimension for the collar, the desired surface for the weld can be 
achieved. The collar can, for example, face inwards. It is also advantageous for the direction in which the material 
flowed during shaping of the container wall to coincide with the radial 
direction of the collar, which enhances the quality of the welded joint. A further improvement of the container according to the 
invention could be achieved if, in addition to an enlargement in the weld 
surface, a reduction in the load to be transmitted could also be 
achieved. This is because, on the one hand, the weld has to be designed 
to be very strong and reliable if high loadings are to be transmitted; on 
the other hand, this is because such a weld remains a weak point in the  
 
construction of the container. Such a further improvement may be achieved if the collar faces

<CLAIMS>
Plastic container comprising a container wall sealed in the 
circumferential direction as well as a lid provided with a lid flange 

which is welded all round to the container wall, characterized in that 
the container wall is provided with an essentially radial collar. 
Container according to Claim 1, in which the collar faces 
radially outwards and, at its side which forms the continuation of the 

interior surface of the container wall, is welded to the lid flange. 
Container according to Claim 2, in which the lid flange has a 
circumferential ridge with a height similar to the thickness of the 

collar, which circumferential ridge surrounds the collar. 
Container according to Claim 2 or 3, in which the container 
wall near the collar is constricted so that the collar is inside the 

container wall in the radial direction. 
Container according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, in which the lid flange 
bears an upright circumferential edge on the side facing away from the 

container wall.
