<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to control systems for air
conditioning/refrigeration systems.Recent international legislation engendered by
environmental concerns over the issues of global warming and
ozone depletion have mandated the elimination of freons including
those used in the multi-billion dollar air conditioning/refrigeration
industry. Substitute refrigerants that have more beneficial
environmental indices such as R134A (a replacement for R12 which
is widely used in the automotive industry) have been proposed for
use in conventional air conditioning/ refrigeration systems but at the
cost of incurring significant input power penalties, loss of capacity
for given component size, and other problems such as lubricant
incompatibility.Most present air conditioning and refrigeration devices,
especially those of small capacity typical of home and automotive
air conditioners, use positive displacement compressor devices of
relatively low pressure ratio (e.g. 4/1). These devices, which typically
run at constant speed, pressure charge an accumulator or storage
device with high pressure refrigerant for subsequent expansion (and
cooling) in the evaporator heat exchanger. These systems cycle on
and off to maintain the accumulator storage tank pressure. As the
cooling load decreases and less refrigerant flow is required, the on-off
cycle time becomes larger. Among the deficiencies with this
approach are the fact that the energy efficiency during startup is
significantly less than that of steady state running, the frequent
cycling during all operating conditions can have deleterious impact 
on reliability, the variation of cooling with demand is considerable
due to the charging and discharging of the accumulator, and, in
fact, the load variation which can be accommodated with this
type of operation is somewhat limited.Subsequent improvements on this type of operation can be
found in more modern systems which modulate compressor and, in
some cases, evaporator and condenser fan speeds to obtain more
nearly uniform operation and somewhat improved cycle turn down
range and efficiency. These systems typically employed fixed or
variable displacement piston, scroll, or wobble plate compressors,
numerous examples of which can be found in the literature.Recent technologies have been disclosed which use
refrigerants with much higher specific volumes than the
conventional R12 and R22 fluids. These systems, which are well
suited to the utilization of small, high speed centrifugal compressors,
require higher pressure

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling a refrigeration system having a working fluid and, in
sequence, an evaporator, a variable speed centrifugal compressor, a condenser and an

expansion valve, comprising:

a) operating said compressor at a constant speed;
b) maintaining said working fluid at a first predefined level of superheat
between said evaporator and said compressor while said compressor is operating at

constant speed;
c) accelerating rotation of said compressor;
d) increasing the superheat of said working fluid between said evaporator
and said compressor to a second predefined level above said first predefined level and

maintaining the superheat at said second predefined level while said compressor is
accelerating; and
e) decreasing the superheat of said working fluid to said first predefined
level when said compressor returns to a constant operating speed.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said expansion valve is adjustable to vary the
flow of said working fluid in the system and wherein the superheat of said working

fluid is increased in step (d) by adjusting flow of said working fluid through said
expansion valve.
The method of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said evaporator includes a variable speed
fan to vary the rate of heat transfer of said working fluid and wherein the superheat

of said working fluid is increased in step (d) by adjusting heat transfer of said working
fluid at said evaporator.
Apparatus for controlling a refrigeration system having a working fluid and,
in sequence, an evaporator, a variable speed centrifugal compressor, a condenser and

an expansion valve, comprising:

a sensor for determining when said compressor is operating at a constant
speed; 
a microprocessor control for maintaining said working fluid at a first
predefined level of superheat between said evaporator and said compressor while said

compressor is operating at constant speed;
a sensor for determining when rotation of said compressor is accelerating; and
a microprocessor control for increasing the superheat of said working fluid
between said evaporator and said compressor to a second predefined level above said

first predefined level and maintaining the superheat at said second predefined level
while said compressor is accelerating.
The apparatus of Claim 4 wherein said expansion valve is adjustable to vary
the flow of said working fluid in the system and wherein the superheat of said

working fluid is increasable by adjusting flow of said working fluid through said
expansion valve.
The apparatus of Claim 4 or 5 wherein said evaporator includes a variable
speed fan to vary the rate of heat transfer of said working fluid and wherein the

superheat of said working fluid is increasable by adjusting heat transfer of said
working fluid at said evaporator.
