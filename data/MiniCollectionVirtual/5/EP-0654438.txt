<ABSTRACT>
In an automatic pipeline switching device (9), the 
connecting joints (1a) of a plurality of material receiving pipes (1) 

are arranged in one line in the direction of X-axis, the 
connecting joints (2a) of a plurality of material feeding pipes (2) are 

held at a standby region in such a manner that they are 
arranged in one line in the direction of Z-axis. The material feeding 

pipes comprise 
rigid pipes (2b) in parallel with Y-axis, flexible hoses (2c) in parallel 

with Z-axis, and flexible hoses (2d) in parallel with X-axis. 
The rigid pipes are arranged in the standby 

region, and they are made larger in length towards the top of 
the standby region to prevent the interference of the flexible 

hoses with each other. Moving means (4,5) operate to move the 
holder (3) in the direction of Z-axis and in the direction of X-axis 

to pick 
up a selected one of the connecting couplings, and then move it 

to a selected one of the connecting couplings so that they are 
connected with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system which continuously
supplies a number of kinds of solution materials from material
storing tanks to a preparing/mixing device, and more
particularly to a device for automatically switching a
destination to which the solution materials are to be supplied.Heretofore, in order to switch the destination of a
number of kinds of solution materials, the connection of the
material supply pipe is manually changed to provide another
material supply pipeline. This work is rather troublesome.
In order to eliminate the troublesome work, a method as shown
in FIG. 6 is employed: That is, in the method, a number of
valves are connected to the pipelines, and the valves thus
connected are automatically operated to provide different
material supply pipelines.The former method mentioned above is disadvantageous in
the following points:
(1) Because of the manual work, the pipes may be
erroneously connected.(2) Because of the manual work, it takes a certain
period of time to accomplish it.(3) In order to prevent the erroneous connection of the
pipes (described in paragraph (1) above), it is necessary to 
detect whether or not the connection of the pipes is
satisfactory.(4) The necessity for detecting whether or not the
connection of the pipes is acceptable (described in paragraph
(3) above) further increases work load and time.The latter method mentioned above suffers from the
following problems:
(1) The resultant product may be unacceptable because
of contamination due to the leakage of solution through the
valves. The probability of this difficulty occurring is
proportional to the number of pipes and valves.(2) The equipment cost is great. For instance in the
case where hundred (100) kinds of chemicals are used by
switching thirty (30) piping systems depending on the kinds of
products to be manufactured, it is necessary to provide three
thousand (3000) automatic valves, and electromagnetic valves
for operating the latter.(3) Since the pipes are extended between the material
storing tanks and the solution preparing/mixing devices, the
pipes filled with the solution materials are considerably long.
This means that replacing the solution materials in the
material storing tanks suffers unavoidably from a great loss of
solution materials.(4) Since the material storing tanks are connected
through the pipes to the solution preparing/mixing devices, the
pipes filled with the solution materials are long. Hence, in 
replacing the solution materials in the material storing tanks,
cleaning the pipes
