<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a vaccine for combating (B. bronchiseptica) infection in susceptible animals (such as dogs and swine), containing proteins or polypeptides typical of the fimbrial protein of (B. bronchiseptica), or containing recombinant polynucleotides having as part thereof a polynucleotide coding for said protein or polypeptide, and also is concerned with the preparation of said proteins, polypeptides and polynucleotides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a vaccine protective against Bordetella 
bronchiseptica infection in dogs, with polypeptides characteristic of B. bronchiseptica 
and with the preparation thereof using rec. DNA-technology. The genus Bordetella is comprised of four species: Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), 
Bordetella parapertussis (B. parapertussis), Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. 
bronchiseptica) and Bordetella avium (B. avium). Bordetella are small gram-negative 
coccobacilli, obligate aerobic, often bipolar stained, and cytochrome oxidase positive. 
Colonies on Bordet-Gengou medium are surrounded by a zone of hemolysis except for 
B. avium. All species of Bordetella cause very similar disease with respect to adherence, 
proliferation, clinical symptoms, and histopathology. Infants of man and animals are 
most susceptible to infection with Bordetella. Here the disease is most severe and 
mortality is the highest. B. bronchiseptica is primarily a pathogen of laboratory, domestic and wild animals and 
only occasionally man. Rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, non-human primates, dogs, swine, 
cats, horses and foxes are often infected in epidemic. B. bronchiseptica most notably 
causes kennel cough in dogs and atrophic rhinitis in piglets. In dogs the infectious 
process is largely limited to the tracheobronchial tree and is characterized by 
proliferation on the tracheal epithelium, after adherence to the cilia. The most severe 
symptoms of the disease are excessive tracheal mucus accumulation, vomiting, 
pulmonary lesions and weight loss. Dogs have a dry, harsh hacking cough. Infection of 
piglets with B. bronchiseptica is characterized by turbinate atrophy, snout deformity, 
pneumonia and reduced weight gain. Although it seemed clearly established that B. 
bronchiseptica was the responsible agent of atrophic rhinitis, considerable evidence now 
indicates that Fasteurella multocida is the major pathogen with B. bronchiseptica 
possibly playing an inducing or opportunistic role. The reported carrier states, without 
clinical signs, are high for dogs, swine and rabbits.  Several virulence factors have been identified in Bordetellae. These include: pertussis 
toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, fimbriae, adenylate cyclase, dermonecrotic toxin, 
tracheal toxin, and hemolysin. These virulence factors are not expressed in all species, 
for example the gene encoding pertussis toxin in B. pertussis is present as a silent gene 
of the chromosome of B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica. Besides these virulence
