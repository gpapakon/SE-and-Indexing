<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium comprising a back coating 
layer formed on a surface reverse to a magnetic layer and a carbonaceous 

film which is formed on the back coating layer and contains 
fluorine atoms and silicon atoms and/or nitrogen atoms and in which 

a concentration of fluorine atoms decreases in a depth direction 
from a surface of the carbonaceous film, while a concentration of 

the silicon and/or nitrogen atoms increases in the depth direction 
from the surface of the carbonaceous film, which recording medium 

has improved running stability, durability and weatherability while 
electromagnetic conversion characteristics are maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium, a method for producing the same and a method for forming a
film by a plasma CVD (chemical vapor deposition). In particular, the
present invention relates to a magnetic recording medium which is
used in an audio or video equipment, a computer, and the like, and has
a back coating layer on a surface of a nonmagnetic substrate reverse
to a magnetic recording layer.In these years, a magnetic recording equipment is
required to have a large capacity, achieve high speed reading and
writing, high picture and sound quality, and have a small size and a
light weight. To satisfy such requirements, it is inevitable for a
magnetic recording medium to achieve a high density recording. To
this end, instead of a conventional powder coating type magnetic
recording medium having a magnetic layer which comprises a binder
and magnetic powder dispersed in said binder, a ferromagnetic metal
thin film magnetic recording medium has been actively developed and
practically used, since it has a larger residual magnetic flux density
(Br) and coercive force (Hc) and a thinner magnetic layer, and is more
suitable for ultra-smoothing of a magnetic layer surface than the
powder coating type one. GB-A-2166668 discloses a magnetic recording medium comprising a substrate, a
ferromagnetic metal thin film formed on the substrate, and a topcoat formed on the
thin film. The topcoat is a plasma-polymerized film containing carbon and hydrogen
in an atomic ratio of C/H of from 1 to 6, and having a thickness of 10 to 40
angstroms and a contact angle with water in the range of 60° to 130°.With the increase of surface smoothness of the magnetic layer, a coefficient of
friction of the magnetic recording medium 
increases, so that running stability and durability tend to be
worsened. Then, it is proposed to provide a back coating layer having
specific surface roughness on a surface of a nonmagnetic substrate
reverse to the magnetic layer.The surface roughness of the back coating layer, in
particular that of the ferromagnetic metal thin film magnetic recording
medium should be as small as possible to decrease a so-called
back transfer, that is, shape transfer of unevenness of the back
coating layer to the magnetic layer surface in a winding up step or a
heat treating step, and to prevent deterioration of electromagnetic
conversion characteristics.To this end, it is proposed to decrease a particle size of a
filler to be contained in the back coating layer, or to add an excessive
amount of a
