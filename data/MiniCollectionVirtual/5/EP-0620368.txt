<ABSTRACT>
So as to be able to adjust, in a gear pump having a sleeve-bearing rotor, the bearing clearance in accordance with the operational conditions it is proposed to equip the sleeve bearing (journal, plain bearing) with a bearing body (11) which is slotted in a clasp-like manner, and to adjust the magnitude of the clearance (width of the gap) (13) and thus the circumference of the cylindrical bearing surface (11z).

<CLAIMS>
A gear pump wherein at least one of the rotors
is mounted at least unilaterally on a slide bearing on the

stator and is lubricated by the material to be conveyed, said
stator comprising to this end a bearing body (11) defining a

substantially cylindrical bearing surface, characterized in
that said bearing body (11) considered axially is

continuously slit (13) like a clasp, and adjusting members
(17, 19 ; 39 ; 49) for the slit width act on said bearing

body (11) as adjusting members to adapt the pump for
conveying different products.
The gear pump according to claim 1,
characterized in that said slit (13) acts as a lubricating

groove (27a) for the bearing and communicates to this end
with the pressure side (D) of the delivery space wherein the

rotor gearwheels engage.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that on said bearing surface (llz) there is

provided a lubricating groove (27) that communicates (29)
with said pressure side (D) of the gear pump delivery space

wherein the rotor gearwheels engage.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that in a peripheral region said bearing

body (11) is firmly attached (15) to stator (7) for rotating
and is preferably replaceable by being axially removed.
The gear pump according to claim 4,
characterized in that said bearing body (11), on its outer

surface facing away from said bearing surface (llz),
comprises at least one groove (31) that extends substantially

axially and increases the radial elasticity of said bearing
body (11).
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that said adjusting members (17, 17a) have

a substantially radial or azimuthal action on said bearing
body (11) or an axial action on the latter by means of a

wedge arrangement.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that said bearing body (11) is sized and 

mounted such that the slit width can change automatically due
to temperature variations in the bearing.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that said adjusting members (49) form the

adusting element in a regulator circuit wherein bearing
temperature (ϑ
x
) and/or differential pressure (Δp
x
) between
the pressure side and the inlet side of the pump are detected

as measured regulating variables and they are regulated,
individually or weighted and combined, by acting on adjusting

element (49).
A method for adjusting the bearing clearance in
a gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized

in that bearing temperature (ϑ
x
) and/or differential pressure
(Δp
x
) between the inlet side and the pressure side of the
pump are measured as regulating variables and they are

regulated with the bearing clearance as an adjusting
variable.
The method according to claim 9, characterized
in that a combined regulating variable is formed from the

measured bearing temperature and from the measured
differential pressure, once weighted.
