<ABSTRACT>
A passive optical network architecture is disclosed for application in a 
local loop
 telephone environment. A local digital switch (10) transmits an optical 
signal bearing information downstream over an optical fiber (11) to the terminal 

equipment (90, 100) of a group of subscribers. This transmitted optical signal 
comprises light at a number of different wavelengths, i.e., it is a wavelength-division 

multiplexed signal, where each subscriber is associated with a particular wavelength 
of light. Each subscriber's terminal equipment detects that portion of the transmitted 

optical signal that exists at its assigned wavelength and thereby recovers the 
information sent by the local digital switch for that subscriber. However, a fraction 

of this detected optical signal is then remodulated (107, 115) by the subscriber's 
equipment with the subscriber's upstream information (123) and returned to the local 

digital switch. As a result, no optical sources are required in the subscriber 
equipment in this optical network architecture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to passive optical communications
networks.In the past ten years optical transmission systems have more and more
taken over the functions of their copper counterparts in the trunk network and
between central offices. However, replacement of copper based transmission in the
trunk network by optical fiber based transmission is only the first step in the
utilization of the large transmission capabilities of optical fibers. Indeed,
deployment of optical fibers may ultimately penetrate further to the local loop plant
to bring broad-band and narrow-band services directly to telephone subscribers.Currently, one area of investigation in optical loop plants involves the
use of a passive optical network (PON) in which there are no active components
between a central office and the subscriber's terminal equipment. In particular, a
feeder fiber from the central office provides a downstream optical signal to a remote
node (RN) that splits the optical signal for distribution onto a number of optical
fibers, each one of which terminates in an Optical Network Unit (ONU). The latter
converts the received optical signal into electrical form and delivers it to either one
or a number of subscribers. Generally speaking, there are currently two popular
PON architectures under consideration for deploying optical fibers into the local
loop - "Telephony over Passive Optical Networks" (TPON) and "Passive Photonic
Loop" (PPL).In a TPON architecture, the central office provides a downstream optical
signal to each of the ONUs utilizing a time-division multiplexed protocol. This
protocol typically comprises a frame of information that is further subdivided into
time slots that are assigned to individual ONUs. Upon receiving the time-division
multiplexed optical signal, each ONU then extracts the information that is contained
in its assigned time slots. Consequently, each ONU must be synchronized to the
transmission of the downstream optical signal to ensure that it correctly performs the
demultiplexing operation. Similarly, in the upstream direction, from each ONU to
the central office (through the RN), the operation of the ONU's laser must be
synchronized so that each ONU transmits information only in its assigned time slot
so as to avoid interfering with the optical signals provided by the lasers of other
ONUs. This synchronization in the upstream direction is further complicated by the
effect of the different optical path lengths, between each ONU and the RN, on an
ONU's respective optical signal. In
