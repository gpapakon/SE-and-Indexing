<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides dental cement compositions 
and methods of using them for binding hard tooth 

material, metal and ceramic. The cement compositions 
include polymerizable acid reactive ethylenically 

unsaturated monomers, and a source of cations reactive 
therewith, to further crosslink the resulting polymer. 

The cements have superior adhesion to tooth without 
separately acid etching dentin or enamel. Compositions 

of are useful as dental luting cements, liners, bases 
and restoratives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dental cement
compositions for use thereof to bind hard
tooth material, metal and ceramic. The invention
provides cement compositions including polymerizable
acid reactive ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and a
source of cations reactive therewith, to provide
further crosslinking in the resulting polymer. The
invention provides cements with superior adhesion to
dentin, enamel and dentin without the need for separate
steps of acid etching dental enamel to adhere to
enamel, cement, and superstructure. Compositions of
the invention are useful as dental luting cements,
liners, bases and restoratives. The compositions of
the invention are hydrolytically stable. The
heterogeneous multi-phase dental cements disclosed
herein include liquid and solids, and show improved
mechanical strength. They provide advantages, for
example, improved bond strength to tooth and are less
sensitive the effects of moisture during the setting
reaction.Prior art zinc oxide/phosphoric acid combinations,
known as zinc phosphate cements, are not adhesive to
metals, enamel or dentin. Zinc oxide and polyacrylic 
acid combinations are known as zinc polycarboxylate
cements. They are relatively weak and soluble. Glass
ionomers are described by A. Wilson in U.S. Patents
5,079,277 and 4,758,612. Prior art glass ionomer
compositions are combinations of a polyalkenoic acid
polymer such as polyacrylic acid and an elutable glass
which provides a source of cations to react with the
polyacrylic acid. Prior art glass ionomers are brittle
and weak in high stress applications and set poorly in
the presence of moisture unless protected from water.
Prior art pit and fissure materials include polymerizable
hydrophobic resins with essentially no adhesion
to tooth. They are adhered by infiltrating micro-mechanical
undercuts produced by acid etching. They
harden in-situ to protect the tooth from colonization
by bacteria in order to reduce caries, but because they
are difficult to use they are not universally employed
to achieve this valuable result. They require the
tooth be cleaned, acid etched, washed, dried and
isolated by rubber dam to maintain dryness, to avoid
contamination by saliva, and achieve suitable results.
The procedure is thus uncomfortable for the patient and
laborious for the dentist. The present invention
provides pit and fissure sealant compositions which are
applied to tooth without a separate acid etching step. Olivier in U.S. Patent 3,234,181 discloses melt-fabricable
