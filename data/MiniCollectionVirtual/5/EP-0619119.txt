<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for stabilizing
parathyroid hormone (hereinafter generally designates as PTH) and
a composition containing parathyroid hormone as the active
ingredient.PTH is a hormone, of which the same as of calcitonin and
vitamin D groups, which pertains controlling serum calcium level
and is used as a diagnostic reagent for hypoparathyroidism. In a
lyophilized preparation for injectable solution at use containing
trace amount of PTH, a sugar such as mannitol or polymer
substance such as gelatin is generally combined. (Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 63-60940 and ibid., No. 2-111)Mannitol is used conventional stabilising agent for the
lyophilized preparation of peptide or protein for injectable
solution at use. However, when mannitol is used as a stabilizing
agent for the lyophilized preparation of PTH for injectable
solution at use, its stabilizing effect is ended an unsatisfactory
result. Polymer substance such as gelatin gives high stabilizing
effect, however its immunological safety problem is still 
uncertainly remained.We have continued to study for finding a stable
preparation of PTH, and an unexpected discovery was made during
the study that extremely more improved stability for the
lyophilized preparation of PTH has been obtained by combining
a constant amount of sodium chloride in sugar together with
lyophilization, as compared with sugar alone.As a result, a safety with excellent heat stable lyophilized
preparation of PTH can be prepared by adding a combination of
sugar and sodium chloride as a stabilizing agent for lyophilized
preparation of PTH.An object of the present invention is to provide a
lyophilized preparation of PTH containing PTH as the active
ingredient and effective amounts of a sugar and sodium chloride as
the stabilizing agent.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
method for stabilizing a preparation of PTH comprises dissolving
PTH, effective amounts of a sugar and sodium chloride in an
aqueous medium, and lyophilizing the same.An active ingredient PTH is a peptide possessing a serum calcium
increasing activity, with a molecular weight of
approx. 4000 - 10000, consisting of an amino acid sequence of
34-84 amino acids, and natural PTH or its analogue are known.
Examples thereof are human PTH(h-PTH)(1-84)[Biochemistry, 17, 5723 
(1978)], h-PTH(1-38) (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.
57-81448), h-PTH(1-34)[Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem., 355, 415
(1974)], h-PTH(1-34)NH2 (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication
