<ABSTRACT>
A process for making mineral-bonded building elements, in particular with a content of chopped fibres and, if appropriate, continuous reinforcement, and also various installations for carrying out such a process are described. The aim of the invention is to develop a process which combines the advantages of the extrusion process with that of the casting and injection process. The building material is introduced under pressure into a supporting mould, so that it is exposed to the same pressure conditions at every point of the building element. In order to ensure uniform pressure conditions in the extrusion process, extruding is carried out into a supporting mould (6a,6b) by means of a special extrusion head tapering towards the die. With the pump (12), the pasty fibre composite is fed via a pressure tube (5) into the extrusion head (13). The course of the flow of the fibre composite is drastically altered on entering into the extrusion head (13) with a deflection of about 90 DEG . This eliminates the influence of the flow behaviour through the feed tube in the head (13).
