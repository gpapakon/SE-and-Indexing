<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
simulation system for a semiconductor device utilizing
a computer aided design (CAD). More specifically, the
invention relates to a unified process and device
simulation system and a simulation method for unitarily
performing a process simulation and a device
simulation.A most important problem in development of a
very large scale integrated circuit (VLSI) element is
how to achieve high precision and high efficiency in
process and device design. Corresponding to a trend to
higher integration density and greater scale, it is
becoming essential to introduce a simulation technology
employing an electronic computer in a stage of process
designing and device designing. As means for
performing the simulation, a unified process and device
simulation system (hereinafter referred to as
"simulator") for process device unitary designing,
which unitarily sets process condition of the process
designing and the device designing in view of a
targeted feature of a final element, has been widely 
employed. In the recent years, corresponding to down-sizing
in the order of sub-micron associating with
further higher integration density of the integration
circuit, higher precision modeling has been required in
simulation. In order to satisfy such requirement,
there have been proposed various so-called second-generation
unified process and device simulators.As one example of such type of unified
process and device simulators, a simulator proposed in
Matsuo et al. "A SUPERVISED PROCESS AND DEVICE SIMULATION
FOR STATISTICAL VLSI DESIGN" in "INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON
NUMERICAL MODELING OF PROCESS AND DEVICES FOR INTEGRATED
CIRCUIT", 1990, pages 59-60 of proceeding of NUPAD 3,
employs a two dimensional process simulator, a two-dimensional
device simulator and a system control unit
called as a supervisor which interprets input data and
generates an input parameter through modification of
standard data in a library, in place of a simple
analysis model or a linear numerical model. In the
literature, there has been reported that when the
simulator is applied for designing of MOSFET according
to 8 µm rule, simulation could be done at higher
precision with one fourth of simulation period in
comparison with the case where the simple analysis
model or the linear numerical model.A simulation method by the above-mentioned
conventional process and device composite simulator for 
simulating variation of electric characteristic of
MOSFET with selecting 1 µm, 2µm and 3 µm as parameter
will be
