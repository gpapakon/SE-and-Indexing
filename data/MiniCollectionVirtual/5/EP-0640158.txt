Method of drying a paper web (B) in which the moist paper web (B)
is guided together with at least one felt (3) for taking up water or the

like through at least one pressing zone (2) formed between two
pressing surfaces (8, 9, 9') and in which so much heat is introduced

into the paper web (B) before and/or in the pressing zone (2) that
the vapour pressure which arises in the fibre structure of the paper

web (B) is greater than the environmental pressure, characterized in
that for the manufacture of a hygiene paper having a sheet weight

between 10 and 40 g/m
2
, the paper web (B) is brought to a dry
content of at least 60 %, in that, on the one hand, only so much

heat is introduced into the paper web (B) that the vapour pressure
which arises in the fibre structure of the paper web (B) is smaller

than the press pressure prevailing in the pressing zone (2), and, on
the other hand, the pressure and temperature conditions in the

pressing zone (2) are set so that the vapour pressure prevailing in
the liquid at the end of the pressing zone (2) is just sufficiently

larger than the environmental pressure that a part of the residual
water located in the web vaporises in controlled manner during the

abrupt relaxation during the run-out of the paper web (B) out of the
press gap (2) and loosens up the fibre structure of the paper web (B).
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that further
heat is also supplied to the paper web after leaving the pressing

zone. 
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
pressing surfaces form an extended pressing zone.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that two
pressing zones disposed after one another when seen in the web

running direction are present.
Method in accordance with claim 4, characterized in that a heating
of the paper web takes place in the pressing zone such that, as a

consequence of the vapour generation, it is lifted off from the pressing
surface which does not stand in contact with the felt and is deposited

onto the felt.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a heating of the paper web takes place in the last

pressing zone such that, as a consequence of the vapour generation,
the paper web is lifted off from the pressing surface which is not in

contact with the felt and is subsequently led away.
Method in accordance with claim 5, characterized in that the paper
web which is led away is wound up or further processed without

craping.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the surface
temperature of the pressing surface in the last pressing zone

amounts to at least 150째C.
Method in accordance with claim 8, characterized in that the surface
temperature of the pressing surface in the last pressing zone

amounts to ca. 300째C. 
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the web is
supplied with an initial dry content of between 10 and 30 % absolute

dryness to the first pressing zone.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the parameters
are so selected that the web has a dry content of more

than 80 % absolute dryness after the drying in the last pressing
zone.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the web
temperature before the last pressing zone amounts to between 50

and 100째C.
Method in accordance with claim 12, characterized in that the web
temperature before the last pressing zone amounts to at least 80째C.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the dwell
time of the web in the respective pressing zone amounts to at least

15 msec.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
pressing pressure in the respective pressing zone amounts to at

least 10 bar.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the heat
supply takes place via a pressing surface.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the heat
supply takes place before a pressing zone.
