<DESCRIPTION>
 ILLUMINATION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A HIGH DEFINITION LIGHT MICROSCOPEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to illumination systems for transmitted light microscopes utilizing condenser lens means and more Ã¸ particularly to such systems that utilize illuminating light directed at an oblique angle relative to the optical axis of the microscope objective.2. The Prior ArtThe use with microscopes of what is commonly refereed to as 5 'oblique light" was of interest towards the end of the last century and the beginning of this, but the many devices designed for that purpose, although ingenious in some cases, have failed to survived. See The Intelligent Use of the Microscope, Oliver, C.W., Chemical Publishing Co.. 1953. 0 Oliver limits his meaning of "oblique light" to the "use of a narrow cone or beam of rays directed upon the object from any direction other than the optical axis provided that it enters the object glass." Ibid, at 94. In this way he excludes from his discussion those systems that use rays directed onto a specimen from a direction other 5 than the optical axis but which do not enter the object glass as well as systems where the light does not enter the objective lens at an angle (such as systems that merely tilt the specimen stage). Illumination provided by systems in which the primary beam does not enter the objective is generally known and commonly refereed to as "dark field" 0 illumination as more fully discussed in PJiotomicrography aComprehensive Treatise. Loveland, R.P.. John Weily & Sons, Chapter 12. Although the present invention utilizes true oblique lighting as that term is used by Oliver, and is thereby clearly distinguishable from ' dark field" systems, a brief description of "bright field" and "dark field" illumination will help to differentiate and more fully highlight 

 Illumination systems that direct rays onto a specimen along the optical axis create "bright field" illumination, so named because the rays passing through the field surrounding the specimen and entering the microscope objective are unimpeded and thus bright compared to c the rays attenuated by passing through the specimen. In a "dark field" system, the relative brightness is reversed by directing only light rays ' onto the specimen field which are angled relative to the optical axis and directed to fall outside the objective aperture. All of the light passing through the specimen field surrounding the specimen is j Q unimpeded and thus does not enter and is therefore not
