<ABSTRACT>
A method for fumigating an enclosed 
structure includes release of sufficient phosphine 

into the enclosed structure to maintain an average 
concentration of between about 50 ppm and 500 ppm 

phosphine. Concurrently, sufficient carbon dioxide is 
released into the enclosed structure to maintain an 

average concentration of between about 4% and 10% 
carbon dioxide, and a temperature of between about 30 

degrees Celsius to about 40 degrees Celsius is 
maintained in the enclosed structure to enhance 

fumigation effectiveness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
phosphine based fumigation methods for controlling 
pests. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a combination of phosphine, carbon dioxide, 
and elevated heat disseminated through a building 
interior to eradicate pests. Fumigation is a conventional method for 
controlling pests in buildings, storage facilities, 
shipholds, trucks, factories, human habitations, or 
other enclosable structures. Toxic fumes or vapors 
are released into an enclosable structure for a 
limited time to exterminate rodents, insects, worms, 
and other destructive or infectious organisms. 
Conventional fumigants have included highly toxic 
chemicals such methyl bromide, hydrogen cyanide, 
ethylene dibromide, ethylene oxide, sulfur dioxide, 
tetrachloride, and p-dichlorobenzene. However, 
because of their extreme toxicity, bioaccumulation 
potential, and persistence, use of many such fumigants 
is now banned or tightly regulated. Because of the hazards associated with 
conventional fumigants, fumigators have begun 
widespread use of phosphine (hydrogen phosphide) as a 
replacement fumigant. Phosphine leaves minimal toxic 
residue, does not accumulate in the biological food 
chain, and is relatively inexpensive. Phosphine is 
comparatively simple to produce at the fumigation  
 
location, typically being produced by reacting 
moisture with a hydrolysable metal phosphide 
composition such as magnesium or aluminum phosphide. However, even phosphine fumigation is 
not without problems. Phosphine is itself a toxic 
chemical requiring care in preparation and use, and 
can require substantial amount of time to be 
ventilated from large, multileveled enclosable 
structures such as a building, warehouse, or storage 
facility. In addition, even low levels of phosphine 
have a detectable odor that requires time to be 
eliminated from the building. Conventional treatment 
of buildings with 500 ppm or greater phosphine 
concentration can require from three to ten days for 
treatment and aeration before the building is ready 
for human occupancy. While this time requirement is 
not of great concern for granary storage bins or the 
like, such substantial fumigation time greatly limits 
the potential for fumigation of factories or other 
human occupied structures. In an effort to eliminate the use of 
highly toxic and bioreactive vapors, an inert gas such 
carbon dioxide can be employed as fumigant. For 
example, U.S. Patent 4,989,363 to Doernemann describes 
a process for slowly admitting carbon
