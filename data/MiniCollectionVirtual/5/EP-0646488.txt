<ABSTRACT>
Contact wire end clamp with a clamp body (1) on which at least one clamping jaw (5) is arranged in a vertically adjustable way. A spark conductor to be clamped on or a contact wire which is also to be clamped can thus be easily matched in terms of its vertical position to an existing contact wire or to an existing current rail.

<CLAIMS>
Contact wire end clamp having a clamping body
(1) on which at least one clamping jaw (3-5) is held by

at least one screw (6-9), characterised in that the
clamping body (1) has a deeper-seated clamping surface

(2), in the region of which at least one of the
clamping jaws (3-5) is arranged in a vertically

adjustable manner on the clamping body (1), with the
vertically adjustable clamping jaw (5) being guided in

a vertically shiftable manner in a hollow (13) which is
arranged in the clamping body (1) in the region of the

clamping surface (2).
Contact wire end clamp according to claim 1,
characterised in that arranged between the vertically

adjustable clamping jaw (5) and the clamping body (1)
is a counter-jaw (14), which corresponds to the

clamping jaw (5).
Contact wire end clamp according to claim 2,
characterised in that by means of the vertically

adjustable clamping jaw (5) and its corresponding
counter-jaw (14), a grooved contact wire (12) can be

clamped in its two grooves.
Contact wire end clamp according to claim 2,
characterised in that the vertically adjustable

clamping jaw (5) and the corresponding counter-jaw (14)
are constructed in one piece in the manner of a

clamping clip.
Contact wire end clamp according to one of the
claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the vertically

adjustable clamping jaw (5) and the corresponding
counter-jaw (14) each have an elongated hole (15, 16)

for receiving a screw (9).
