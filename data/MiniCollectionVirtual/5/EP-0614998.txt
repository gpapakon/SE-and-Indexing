<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diamond
covered member useful for semiconductor substrates,
heat sinks, various protection films, optical parts,
and the like. The present invention also relates to a
process for producing the above diamond covered member.Diamond crystal, which has high hardness, high
thermal conductivity, and excellent chemical stability,
is widely used for cutting tools, abrasion-resistant
tools, heat sinks (heat-releasing parts), and so forth.
Furthermore, diamond semiconductors, which are doped
with an impurity such as Group 3b and 5b elements of
Periodic Table, have many advantages such as the band
gap (5.4 eV) thereof much larger than that of silicon
semiconductor, the higher mobility of the positive
holes therein, the mobility of electrons therein
approximately equal to that of silicon, the small
dielectric constant, the high thermal conductivity, and
so forth.Thin diamond crystal films are generally grown
in a form of a rough polycrystal film on a substrate
made of silicon, molybdenum, or the like. In recent 
years, methods are disclosed for epitaxial growth of
diamond crystal on a varieties of substrates and for
formation of diamond crystal having a smooth surface
for the purpose of utilizing the above characteristics
of diamond crystal.For example, diamond crystal is known to grow
epitaxially on a diamond single-crystal substrate by
vapor-phase synthesis. Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. 63-252998 discloses growth of a diamond
single-crystal on a silicon carbide single-crystal
substrate. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
64-3098 discloses growth of a diamond single-crystal on
an oxide single-crystal substrate. Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 2-233591 describes that a
single-crystal diamond layer is formed when the lattice
constant difference between the diamond crystal and the
substrate is less than 20 % and the molar ratio of
carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms is in the range of from
1 to 10 %. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
1-301864 describes the formation of thin film having
maximum surface roughness of 200 Å or less composed of
a mixture of diamond crystals, graphite crystals and
amorphous carbon under the formation conditions of an
organic gas concentration of 3 mol% or higher, and use
thereof for a forming die for glass.Since a diamond single-crystal substrate is
extremely expensive, and is not useful practically. 
The epitaxial growth on a silicon carbide single-crystal
substrate or an oxide single-crystal substrate
