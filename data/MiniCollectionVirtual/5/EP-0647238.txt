<ABSTRACT>
An Interleukin-1 beta  deletion mutant, which has a quasi conserved sequence of three amino acids deleted from the amino acid sequence of an endogenous mammalian Interleukin-1 beta  is disclosed. The deletion is Ser Asn Asp (numbers 52-54 of mature human IL-1 beta ) in the case of human, mouse, rat and rabbit, and Arg Asp Asn in the case of bovine and sheep Interleukin-1 beta . The Interleukin-1 beta deletion mutant is shown to be an Interleukin-1 receptor ligand which binds to both Interleukin-1 type I receptors and Interleukin-1 type II receptors with substantially different binding-affinities. The ligand may have additional amino acid deletion(s) and/or point mutation(s). The Interleukin-1 beta  deletion mutants may be used as carriers and adjuvants for biologically active molecules as well as in therapeutic and/or prophylactic agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
INTERLEUKIN-lβ DELETION MUTANTThe present invention relates to an Interleukin-lβ deletion mutant which has a quasi conserved sequence of three amino acids deleted from the amino-acid sequence of an endogenous mammalian Interleukin-lβ. In the case of a human Interleukin- lβ deletion mutant, said three deleted amino acids are Ser Asn Asp (numbers 52-54 of mature human IL-lβ), which mutant is also called ΔSND.BackgroundThe cytokines Interleukin-lβ and β (IL-lα and IL-lβ), are mediators of a multitude of processes involving the immune endocrine and nervous system (cf for review [1]). The role of interleukin-lα and β as inflammatory mediators, as lymphocyte activating factors, endogenous pyrogens and radiation-protec¬ tive agents render these two small proteins of approximately 153 amino acids extremely interesting in both physiological and pharmacological studies. However, widespread use of IL-lα and IL-lβ in therapy has been hampered by their high pyroge- nicity.Since the molecular identification and cloning of the cDNA coding for the urine IL-lα by Lo edico et al in 1984, [2] the interleukin-lα and β have been in the focus of interest by molecular biologists, protein chemists and crystallo- graphers. The cDNA sequences for IL-lα and IL-lβ are known from several species. Two IL-1 receptors have been cloned. Type I from T-lymphocytes [3] and type II from B-lymphocyteε [4]. Discovery and cloning of an endogenously occuring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra), which belongs to the same protein family as IL-lα and β [e.g. 5], and which antagonizes the actions of these agonists by binding to the same recep¬ tor, has accelerated studies on the IL-1 receptor-ligand interactions. 

A large number of modifications, such as point-mutations, of the human IL-lβ have been examined with respect to their effect on biological and receptor binding properties of the IL-lβ molecule [e.g.6, 7, 8]. Important residues in both the N-terminal portion of IL-lβ [9, 10, 11] and in its C-terminal region [12] have been identified. However, to our knowledge no interesting internal deletion mutants of IL-lβ have been reported.Description of the inventionThe amino acid sequences of IL-lβ from a variety of species, have now been compared with the sequence of the human IL-1 ra, which is the only known human IL-1 antagonist. A struc- tural motif, which is quasi conserved in interleukin-β from different species but is missing from the human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, was identified. In this context it can be mentioned that there also
