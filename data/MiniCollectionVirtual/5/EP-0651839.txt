<ABSTRACT>
Known drainage channels to be laid in the ground have a channel body, the welts of which have been cast with grooves for the insertion of a covering. When laid in the ground the drainage channels are sealed off from the ground with first sealing devices along their welts. Second sealing devices are provided to seal off from each other two drainage channels with contiguous faces. These sealing devices each have grooves which can be filled with a sealing compound (32, 33). The known drainage channels are not entirely sealed off from the ground. The invention proposes that junction channels are provided between the first and the second grooves, designed in such a way that the sealing compound (32) of the first sealing devices can be filled so as to verge into the sealing compound (33) of the second sealing devices to form a complete or one-piece transition (34). Also, used in place of a sealing compound (33) is a pressed continuous seal (37) which comes into contact with the sealing compound (32) of the first sealing devices in the region of the junction channels or chambers.

Method for assembling a drainage channel laid in the ground,
having a channel body (10) with first sealing devices for sealing

the drainage channel along its upper borders with respect to the
ground and with second sealing devices for sealing each two

drainage channels, laid abutting one another by their end faces,
with respect to one another, the sealing devices comprising first

grooves (31) and second grooves (29), which serve to receive a
sealing material (32, 33),

comprising the following steps:

arranging a compressed continuous seal (37) as the second
sealing device in the second grooves (29), the material of the

continuous seal (37) reaching up to a connecting channel or a
chamber (23, 24) and coming into contact there with a sealing

compound (32) introduced through the first grooves (31) and
belonging to the first sealing devices;
placing or inserting the continuous seal (37) into the second

groove (29) and subsequently pressing the channel bodies (10)
together in such a way that the material of the continuous seal

(37) emerges visibly at the upper end of the upwardly open second
groove (29);
severing or cutting off the material of the continuous seal
(37) substantially flush with the upper edge of the channel body

(10) or a frame (20, 20') situated thereon;
introducing end-face sealing compound (33) into the first
grooves (31), the end-face sealing compound (33) coming into

contact with the material of the continuous seal (37) by way of
the chambers or connecting channels (23, 24).
Drainage channel laid in the ground and produced from
channel bodies by an assembly method according to Claim 1, with

first sealing devices for sealing the drainage channel along its
upper borders with respect to the ground and with second sealing

devices for sealing each two drainage channels, laid abutting one 
another by their end faces, with respect to one another, the

sealing devices comprising first grooves (31) and second grooves
(29), in which sealing material is received, with connecting

channels (24) between the first grooves (31) of the first sealing
device and second grooves (29) of the second sealing device,

which are constructed in such a way that the sealing compound
(32) of the first sealing device can be filled in so as to merge

in a complete or integral transition (34) into the sealing
compound (33) of the second sealing device, the second sealing

device being a compressed continuous seal (37) and the material
of the continuous seal (37) reaching up to the connecting channel

(24) or to a chamber (23) and coming into contact there with the
sealing compound (33), and with means for pressing the channel

bodies (lo) together.
Drainage channel laid in the ground and produced from
channel bodies by an assembly method according to Claim 1,

channels (24) have a channel floor (25) which opens into the

first grooves (31) substantially at the level of a lower boundary
(35) of the said first grooves.
Drainage channel laid in the ground and produced from
channel bodies by an assembly method according to Claim 1,
