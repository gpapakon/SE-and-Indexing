<ABSTRACT>
Method for the production of hollow sections from aluminium alloys containing more than 10% by weight of Si by extrusion at pressures of 1000 to 10,000 t. The hollow sections contain at least one cylindrical running surface in section tube form. The method can be used for the extrusion of cylinder liners.

Process for the production of hollow profiles by the extrusion of an aluminium
alloy containing more than 10 % by weight Si, characterised in that an extrusion

billet consisting of an aluminium alloy belonging to one of the types AlSi12,
AlSi18, AlSi16, AlCuMgSi15-19, AlMgCuSi15-19 or AlFeMgCuSi15-19 is

brought to a temperature of 300 to 500°C and is worked by extrusion at a pressure
of 30.3975 to 354.6375 bar into hollow profiles containing at least one cylindrical

working surface in the form of a section tube, the profile speed being 0.5 to
