<ABSTRACT>
A color image forming apparatus which includes: an enclosure
body having an upper body (10A) and a lower body (10B); a photoreceptor

for forming a toner image on its surface; a charger (112) for
charging the surface of the photoreceptor; a laser beam

generator (113) for forming a latent image on the surface charged by
the charger (112); a black developer (204) for forming a black toner

image; in which the photoreceptor and the black developer (204) form
a process cartridge (2102) and the process cartridge is detachably

accommodated in the upper body (10A); a color developer (2002) for forming
a color toner image; in which the color developer includes a

toner replenishing port and a toner hopper, and the color
developer (2002) is capable of being detached from the process

cartridge (2102) so that the color toner is supplied to the toner
hopper through the toner replenishing port; a transfer means (136) for

transferring the black toner image and the color toner image
from the surface of the photoreceptor to the recording medium;

and a support shaft member (3) for pivotally supporting the upper
body (10A) and the lower body (10B) so that the upper body has a closed

position in which the upper body is coupled with the lower
body by a coupling member so as to enable the color image

forming apparatus for forming a color image and an open
position in which the process cartridge is moved upward so as

to create an open space between the transfer means or and the
photoreceptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color image forming 
apparatus in which a photoreceptor is used as an image 
retainer for forming a toner image on its surface, and more 
particularly relates to an improvement in the workability of 
jam clearance and toner replenishment by replacing a process 
cartridge. In a color image forming apparatus for which a 
photoreceptor is used, a plurality of developing units are 
disposed around the photoreceptor, that is, four developing 
units including toners of Y, M, C and black are respectively 
disposed close to the circumferential surface of the 
photoreceptor. Development operation is conducted in such a 
manner that the toners of primary colors of Y, M and C are 
superimposed when the photoreceptor is rotated by 3 
revolutions (by 4 revolutions when black toner is included).  
 
Then the formed toner image is transferred onto a transfer 
sheet and thermally fixed by a fixing unit. A photoreceptor drum or photoreceptor belt, which is an 
image forming body, composes a process cartridge together with 
a cleaner, charger, discharger and developing unit. In the 
case where a problem has occurred in the process of operation, 
the process cartridge is taken out from the image forming 
apparatus, so that inspection and jam clearance can be easily 
carried out. In spite of the above construction, inspection 
and jam clearance can not be competently carried out in the 
image forming apparatus of the prior art. Further, the image forming apparatus of the prior art has 
the following disadvantages:
 
When the process cartridge and a unit composed of developing 
units are engaged with the image forming apparatus after they 
have been disengaged from it, they can not be smoothly 
connected with a drive system, and further it is difficult to 
conduct maintenance and jam clearance. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
color image forming apparatus in which the above problems of 
the prior art are solved. The above object can be solved by one of the following 
technical means (1) to (9).  (1) A color image forming apparatus comprising an image 
retainer and a plurality of developing units, wherein the 
black developing unit and the image forming body are included 
in a process cartridge, and the Y, M, C color developing units 
are separated from the process cartridge and preferably formed 
into a color developing unit, and a transfer region is opened 
and the color developing units are attached to and detached 
from the image forming apparatus when the process
