<ABSTRACT>
The headbox according to the invention contains two turbulence generators (2 and 3) located one after another, with an intermediate chamber (4) located between them. For influencing the flow condition in a desired manner, a fluid, for example dilution water, can be added into the region of one of these turbulence generators or of both. By means of the combination of two turbulence generators located one after another and an intermediate chamber, local mixing conditions are produced which are particularly suitable for the purpose striven for. In advantageous embodiments, the turbulence generator (2) lying upstream in the flow direction is significantly more effective than that following after the intermediate chamber (4).

Headbox for a papermaking machine, having at least one transverse flow distributor (1) which is followed downstream by at least two turbulence generators each formed by a plurality of turbulence generator elements, there being an intermediate chamber (4) located between two successive turbulence generators (2 and 3) and the last turbulence generator in the flow direction being followed by a nozzle chamber, at the end of which there is an outlet gap (5) which extends substantially over the entire papermaking machine width and from which, during operation of the headbox, a suspension jet can emerge, 
characterized in that
, in the region of the turbulence generator (2) located upstream of the intermediate chamber (4) in the flow direction and formed as a step diffuser, there are lines (6) which are configured and connected in such a way that a fluid can be supplied or discharged through the lines (6), these lines (6) being connected to the pipelines (7) of the turbulence generator (2) or opening into the intermediate chamber (4), and 
in that
 the flow cross-section at the inlet to the turbulence generator located upstream of the intermediate chamber (4) can be adjusted in such a way and, by means of an actuating valve (9) or the like, the volume through the lines (6) can be set in such a way that the setting of the valve (9) on a respective line (6) is coordinated with the setting of a valve (10) at the inlet into the turbulence generator located upstream of the intermediate chamber (4).
