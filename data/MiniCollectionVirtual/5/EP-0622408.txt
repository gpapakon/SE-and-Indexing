<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a polymer composition comprised of 
gellan, carrageenan and mannan gums and a process for producing 

flexible films for encapsulation comprising the gellan, carrageenan and 
mannan gum composition. The mannan gums include the 

galactomannans and the glucomannans. Advantageously, soil capsules 
of the above composition are produced using the novel process. The 

composition comprises a blend of a gellan gum: (carrageenan/mannan 
gum) wherein the gellan gum concentration ranges from about 0.1 to 50 

weight percent and the ratio of carrageenan/locust bean gum ranges 
from 3:1 to 1:3. Additional reagents are added to this gum blend to 

form a film-forming polymer composition useful in the production of 
gelatin-free capsules or microcapsules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer composition
comprised of gellan, carrageenan and mannan gums and a process for
producing flexible films for encapsulation comprising the gellan,
carrageenan and mannan gum composition. Advantageously, soft
capsules of the above composition are produced using the novel process.The art reveals that processes and compositions for
encapsulation or producing soft capsules generally are composed of
gelatin or animal based gels. Soft capsules have primarily been made
from low bloom gelatin which melts at low temperatures so that in the
manufacturing process two sheets of gelatin are sealed simultaneously
with the filling of the capsule. There is a need, however, for producing
soft capsules containing liquid or solid contents selected from food or
nutritional supplements including vitamins or minerals and the like
wherein the capsules are edible and derived from non animal based
sources and the capsules can be produced on the existing machinery
which is utilized to produce the gelatin based capsules and films.
Various polysaccharides and various processes for making them and
using them are known. See: U.S. 4,326,052; 4,326,053; 4,377,636;
4,385,123; 4,647,470; 4,746,528 and 5,112,445. U.S. Pat. No.
4,746,528 describes combinations of gellan, xanthan gum and a
galactomannan and/or glucomannan gum used to produce elastic gels.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,647,470 describes blends of low-acetyl gellan gum with
xanthan gum and locust bean gum, konjak, tara or cassia gums which
are useful for modifying the brittleness of gellan food products. Gelled
food product compositions comprising blends of gellan gum/K-carrageenan
gum and mannan gums in weight ratios of about 80:20 to 
10:90 of K-carrageenan to mannan and about 95:5 to 20:80 of gellan
gum to (K-carrageenan/mannan) are known. See GB 2219803 A.The art also reveals that heretofore many of the film-forming
water soluble materials have high melting temperatures and/or
decompose at melting temperatures thus rendering them unsuitable for
producing non-animal based capsules. There is an additional need to
provide soft capsules which may be utilized to encapsulate bath oils and
the like wherein the capsular material is composed of non-gelatin based
sources and is water soluble. There is an additional need for novel
processes related to the production of non-animal based soft capsules or
flexible films such as those claimed and disclosed in the present
invention. The present invention therefore satisfies the need for
producing capsules
