<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides vaccine compositions of attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). More particularly, the attenuated virus may be a derivative of RSV which has been incompletely attenuated by cold-passage or introduction of mutations which produce virus having a temperature sensitive (t

&
 _a

 _) phenotype. The invention also provides methods for stimulating the immune system of an individual to induce protection against respiratory syncytial virus by administration of attenuated RSV. The invention also provides pure cultures of attenuated RS virus, wherein the virus has been more completely attenuated by the further derivatization of previously identified incompletely attenuated t

<DESCRIPTION>
Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus infection of humans ranges from
asymptomatic to severe respiratory tract disease. In infants and children, RS virus
(RSV) is regarded as one of the most important causes of lower respiratory tract disease
in all geographic areas of the world. RS virus outranks all other microbial pathogens as
a cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants under one year of age. and is a major
cause of fatal respiratory tract disease in these infants. Virtually all children are infected
by two years of age. Reinfection occurs with appreciable frequency in older children
and young adults. (Chanock et al., in Viral Infections of Humans, 3d ed., A.S. Evans.
ed., Plenum Press, N.Y. (1989)). Although most healthy adults do not have serious
disease due to RS virus infection, elderly patients and immunocompromised individuals
are more likely to have severe and possibly life-threatening infections.Treatment of RSV infection has been problematic. Small infants have
diminished serum and secretory antibody responses to RSV antigens and thus suffer
more severe infections, whereas cumulative immunity appears to protect older children
and adults against more serious forms of the infection. One antiviral compound,
ribavirin, has shown promise in the treatment of severely infected infants. although
there is no indication that it shortens the duration of hospitalization or diminishes the
infant's need for supportive therapy.The mechanisms of immunity in RSV infection have recently come into
focus. Secretory antibodies appear to be most important in protecting the upper
respiratory tract, whereas high levels of serum antibodies are thought to have a major
role in resistance to RSV infection in the lower respiratory tract. Purified human
immunoglobulin containing a high titer of neutralizing antibodies to RSV may prove
useful in immunotherapeutic approaches for serious lower respiratory tract disease in
infants and young children. Immune globulin preparations, however, suffer from
several disadvantages, such as the possibility of transmitting blood-borne viruses and
difficulty and expense in preparation and storage.Despite an urgent need for an effective vaccine against RS virus,
particularly for infants and young children, previous attempts to develop a safe and
effective vaccine have met with failure. A formalin-inactivated virus vaccine tested in 
the mid-1960s failed to protect against RS virus infection or disease. Instead, disease
was exacerbated during subsequent infection by RS virus. Kim et al.,

least one attenuated respiratory syncytial virus having at least two attenuating mutations,

that is selected from temperature-sensitivc mutants of host range-restricted cold-passaged
