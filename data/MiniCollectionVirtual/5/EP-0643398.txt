<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of a conductive fiber cloth 
comprising a conductive fibrous material and optionally a 

water-swellable material and/or a non-conductive, optionally 
reinforcing, fibrous material, which water-swellable material 

is provided on and/or in the fiber cloth, as cable wrapping, 
for providing conductance, shielding, or a combination of the 

two, in a cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of cables and more
specifically to the use of electrically conductive cable wrapping in the
manufacture of cables.The use of conductive wrappings in cables is known. In the
manufacture of power cables, conductive wrapping is used in the screen range,
in order to provide for a good electrical contact between the core screen, the
metal screen and the metal water barrier, if any is present. In this type of
cable wrapping it is only important that volume conductivity is provided in the
wrapping.Well known are types of cable wrapping which are built up from a
fibrous web (non-woven) which has been impregnated with conductive carbon
black. In particular in the case where the wrapping must impart to the cable
not only conductive properties but also longitudinal water impermeability, a
problem arises in that in such cases the conductive properties sometimes come
out insufficiently.A disadvantage of the use of conductive carbon black is that carbon
black is noble in comparison with the metals which are present in cables. This
means that galvanic corrosion of conductors and/or the screen can arise, which
is undesirable.The object of the invention is to provide a conductive cable
wrapping, which may optionally comprise a water-swellable material, to which
wrapping have been imparted in a simple manner suitable conductive
properties, such as volume conductance and optionally shielding, while a
number of disadvantages of the prior art do not arise or arise to a minor extent
only.The invention is based inter alia on the surprising insight that it is
possible to provide a network by which electrical conduction and optionally
shielding are obtained in a cable by the use of conductive fibers, for instance in
the form of a blend of non-conductive fibers and conductive fibers, optionally in 
combination with a water-swellable material, or by an assembly of a
conductive and a non-conductive cloth which have been bonded onto each
other.The invention accordingly relates inter alia to the use of a
conductive fiber cloth, as defined in claim 1.Surprisingly, it has been found that such a laminated conductive
cloth is highly suitable for imparting conductive and optionally shielding
properties to power cable. By the use of conductive fibers in the wrapping, the
undesired galvanic corrosion caused by carbon black does not arise or arises to
a minor extent only, since the conductive wrapping comprises metal fibers
which are not nobler than the conductor and/or the shield, so that the
