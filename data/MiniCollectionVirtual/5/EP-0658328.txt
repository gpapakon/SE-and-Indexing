<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a very 
comfortable and easy to use bed outfit. As is known, bed outfits or equipment 
usually comprise a bottom sheet, a top sheet, which 
are also called the lower sheet and upper sheet, as 
well as further covering elements and the like. For properly using such a bed outfit, it is 
necessary to properly bind the bottom sheet to the 
bed mattress, so as to facilitate the bed recovering 
and to prevent the bottom sheet from greasing in use. For this reason, there have been provided 
sheet elements including pocket corners, adapted to 
firmly engage the underlying bed mattress by 
exploiting the resiliency of the edge portions of 
these corners. Such an approach, however, has not been 
found to properly solve some problems associated in a 
conventional use of a bed outfit. In fact, because of movements of a sleeping 
person, very frequently the top sheet is disengaged 
from the foot side of the mattress, that is the side 
thereof facing the foot part of the bed, with the 
drawback that the top cover is partially moved away  
 
from the sleeping person who is consequently wakened, 
which thing represents a great drawback, particularly 
in winter time. This drawback, moreover, compels the user 
to interrupt his/her sleep in order to properly 
recover the bed. Moreover, a proper locating of the foot 
side of the bed outfit components under the bed 
mattress is a very difficult operation, since to 
raise the mattress, in order to properly locate under 
it the bottom sheet and top covering elements is a 
very difficult operation, in particular if the 
mattress is of a large size. Accordingly, the aim of the present 
invention is to provide such a bed outfit which is 
specifically designed for overcoming the above 
mentioned drawbacks and which, accordingly, is much 
more comfortable than prior bed outfit arrangements. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide such a bed outfit which is adapted to greatly 
simplify all of the bed recovering operations. Another object of the present invention is  
 
to provide such a bed outfit which is adapted to 
efficiently prevent the bed outfit top components 
from disengaging from the foot side of the mattress. According to one aspect of the present 
invention, the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become more 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a very 
comfortable and easy to use bed outfit comprising a 
bottom sheet provided for
