<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for sealing between the frames of a framework for a facade of the shutter-wall type, in which the gaps (5) between adjacent glazing elements (panes of glass) (3,4) are open to the surrounding atmosphere and allow the natural elements (bad weather) to penetrate inside the framework. According to the invention, this system comprises, in combination, a primary seal (6) made of elastomeric material, positioned vertically and set back inside the building relative to the facade, and a secondary seal (7), also made of elastomeric material, a first part (7b) of which forms a flap which extends horizontally, between two crossmembers of superimposed frames (2), in the direction of the facade, between the primary seal (6) and the facade, whereas a second part (7a), joined to the first part and rising perpendicularly to the latter, extends to the rear of the primary seal (6), relative to the facade, and is inserted between facing vertical surfaces of the two adjacent frames.

A façade of the curtain wall type, comprising a 
sealing system between the carcass frames of this façade 

supporting contiguous glazing, in which façade there are 
located spaces (5) between contiguous glazing sections (3, 

4), which spaces (5) are open to the ambient atmosphere and 
allow bad weather to penetrate inside the carcass, said 

sealing system comprising a combination of a primary 
elastomeric weather seal (6), disposed vertically and offset 

towards the inside of the building with respect to the 
glazing, and a secondary weather seal (7), which is also 

elastomeric and of which a first part (7b) forming a flap 
extends horizontally between two superposed frame crosspieces 

(1,2) from the primary weather seal (6) in the direction of 
the glazing, while a second part (7a), adjoining the first 

and perpendicular thereto, extends to the rear of the primary 
seal (6), characterised in that the superposed frame 

crosspieces comprise mutually facing vertical surfaces and in 
that the second seal part (7a) is interposed between said 

mutually facing vertical surfaces. 
A façade according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the primary weather seal (6) is accommodated in vertical 

recesses in the frames and has on its surface fins projecting 
and gripped and deformed between the seal body and the 

lateral walls of its housing or housings. 
A façade according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the second, vertically disposed part 

(7a) of the weather seal (7) comprises fins projecting from 
its surface, these fins being gripped and deformed between 

the opposing surfaces of the superposed frame crosspieces. 
A façade according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the second part (7a) of the secondary  

 
weather seal (7) is folded back on itself to cover a part (8) 

of a vertically projecting frame, which part (8) is engaged 
in a recess (9) in the frame directly thereabove.
