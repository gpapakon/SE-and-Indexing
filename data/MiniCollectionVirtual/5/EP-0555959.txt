<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a multi-stage 
polymer. In particular the present invention relates to multi-stage polymers 
produced by a two-stage aqueous emulsion polymerization process. It is known that multi-stage emulsion polymers made significant 
improvements over previous mixtures and blends such as described in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,916,171. By polymerizing one component in the presence of another 
to form a multi-stage polymer, improvements in stability, rheology and water 
resistance were realized. It is still further known that the addition of an acrylic polymer into 
cement mixtures improves mortar properties such as strength and adhesion of 
the mortar to a variety of substrates such as cement, wood and polystyrene foam. 
However, while the addition of multi-stage emulsion polymers have made 
some improvement in strength and adhesion properties, further improvements 
are required. General physical properties such as strength and adhesion of the mortar or 
modified cementitious material generally coincides with the polymer stiffness, 
the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the minimum film forming 
temperature (MFFT). Generally, the higher the Tg and MFFT of the polymer 
used in cement mixtures, the greater the strength and adhesion of modified 
mixtures (Ohama, et al., ACI Materials Journal, vol. 88, pp. 56-61 (1991)). MFFT is 
the temperature at which a latex polymer forms a continuous film. However, 
the disadvantage in employing a high Tg polymer as the modifier is the need for 
higher curing temperatures. A higher curing polymer is not a concern where 
elevated curing temperatures for the most part are obtainable. However, the 
need for higher curing temperatures significantly limits the use of high Tg 
polymers as modifiers during the autumn or early winter periods of the year. 
Lower ambient temperatures during these periods significantly limits the use of 
high Tg polymers. On the other hand, lower Tg latex polymers may be otherwise 
preferred since shorter curing times and lower curing temperatures make their 
use practicable during the winter and fall when ambient temperatures are lower.  Another inherent problem with the use of lower Tg polymers is the loss of 
strength and adhesion of the polymer-modified material. Therefore, what is 
required is a latex polymer that may be useful as a modifier for cementitious 
material well into the fall and early winter when ambient temperatures are 
generally cooler. The use of lower Tg polymers at lower
