<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a process for reducing data in the transmission and/or storage of digital signals from several interdependent channels. As the signals from the channels are not mutually independent, it is possible further to reduce the quantity of data during transmission. In prior art processes for coding signals from two stereo channels, it is possible with a poor signal composition to cause interference through the coding which is not covered by the signal actually present in the channel and detract from listening enjoyment. In the process of the invention, by the use of the spectral values of corresponding blocks, the necessary data rate for separate coding of the two channels and for joint coding is balanced. The channels are jointly coded as long as the data rate for joint coding does not exceed the data rate for the separated coding of the channels concerned by a predeterminable value. In this case the spectral values of the corresponding blocks are similar so that joint coding is preferred. With very dissimilar signals, balancing results in separate signal transmission. The joint coding of several channels is temporarily suspended in order to be certain of preventing interference.

Process for reducing data during the transmission 
and/or storage of digital audio signals from several 

interdependent channels, in which scanning values from 
signals from the time range are transferred in blocks 

into the frequency range (into spectral values), the 
spectral values are coded, taking into account a 

listening threshold determined by means of a psychoacoustic 
model, transmitted and/or stored, decoded and 

transmitted back into several channels into the time 
range, characterised in that with the assistance of 

the spectral values of corresponding blocks of several 
channels, balancing of the required data transfer rate 

is carried out for a separate coding (mono-coding) of 
channels as well as for a joint coding of channel 

signals, and that a joint coding of channel signals is 
achieved so long as the data transfer rate for the 

joint coding does not exceed the data transfer rate 
for the separate coding of the two channels by a 

predeterminable value. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that an 
estimator function (SF) is formed for balancing the 

required data transfer rate which indicates the number 
of bits required for each block in order to maintain 

the interferences caused by the coding process below 
the listening threshold in the case of a predetermined 

coding process. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the estimator function (SF (Ki, Kj, Kk...) of the 

required data transfer rate is formed for the separate 
coding of channel signals by adding the estimator  

 
functions (SF (Ki), SF (Kj)...) of the signals from 

the channels (Ki, Kj...). 
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the joint coding is achieved by the formation of 

linear combinations (matrixing) of the input signals 
which is cancelled again during decoding 

(dematrixing). 
Process according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the estimator function (SF 

(Mijk...)) of the required data transfer rate for the 
joint coding of signals from channels (Ki, Kj, Kk...) 

is formed by adding the estimator functions (SF (Mi), 
SF (Mj), SF (Mk)...), where Mi is the i-th matrixed 

channel. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a permitted maximum interference 

is predetermined for the decoded signal in the 
channels, that the respective listening threshold for 

the maximum interference is calculated in the channels 
and is used for determination of the estimator 

function for the joint coding. 
Process according to one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that the perceptual entropy (PE) of 

the audio signal is used as estimator function. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that a joint coding of the signals of 

several channels (Ki, Kj, Kk...) occurs if the 
following relation is fulfilled  

 

SF (Mijk...) 
<
 C
1
 SF (Ki, Kj, Kk...) + C
2
, 
 
where C
1
 and C
2
 are predeterminable constants. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the constant C
1
 lies between the values 1 and 2. 
Process according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised in 
that the constant C
2
 is zero.
