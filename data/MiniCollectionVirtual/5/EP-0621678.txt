of series connected thyristors having an overvoltage 

protection function and a plurality of impedance circuits. 
Each of the impedance circuits is connected in parallel with 

one of the thyristors, respectively. The impedance circuits

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an overvoltage
protection circuit, and more particularly to an
overvoltage protection circuit using thyristors with an
overvoltage protection function, an overvoltage
protection equipment constructed with the same and a
power converter also constructed with the same.Fig. 9 of the accompanying drawings is a
layout diagram showing an example of a conventional
overvoltage protection equipment using thyristors
equipped with an overvoltage protection function
(hereinbelow called VBO-free thyristors).In this figure, 1 is an induction motor, 2 is
a power converter that supplies low frequency AC power
to the secondary circuit of induction motor 1, and 3 is
an overvoltage protection equipment wherein three
overvoltage protection circuits 4, constituted by
connecting in series a plurality of anti-parallel
connection circuits consisting of VBO-free thyristors
11, are connected between each phase of power converter
2. When overvoltage is generated in the secondary
circuit of induction motor 1 by shut-down etc. of the
primary side of induction motor 1, the secondary
circuit of induction motor 1 is short-circuited to
protect induction motor 1 from overvoltage. Fig. 10 of the accompanying drawings is a
specific layout diagram of the conventional overvoltage
protection circuit 4 shown in Fig. 9. In this layout,
a plurality of anti-parallel connection circuits, each
consisting of VBO-free thyristors 11 connected in anti-parallel,
are connected in series; snubber circuits
consisting of series circuits of snubber capacitor 12
and snubber resistor 13 are connected in parallel with
the respective anti-parallel connection circuits; and
voltage grading resistors 14 are, respectively,
connected therewith in parallel.A VBO-free thyristor 11 is a device which,
when a predetermined prescribed voltage is applied, can
perform turn-on, even without a gate signal being
applied. Snubber capacitors 12, snubber resistors 13
and voltage grading resistors 14 are provided with the
purpose of ensuring uniform voltage sharing between the
VBO-free thyristors 11 which are connected in series;
their values are the same for each circuit. If we
represent the voltage at which firing of VBO-free
thyristor 11 takes place without application of a gate
signal by VVBO, the turn-on voltage in the entire
series circuit constituted by n VBO-free thyristors 11
is n.VVBO.In the overvoltage protection equipment 3
shown in Fig. 9, when the overvoltage protection 
equipment 3 is constructed with three overvoltage
protection circuits
