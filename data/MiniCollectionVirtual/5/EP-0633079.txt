<ABSTRACT>
An elongate L-shaped metal profile of constant cross section 
for forming into a horseshoe comprising a base (1) with an 

upstanding lip (8) along a front edge thereof. The base (1) 
is thicker and wider than the lip (8) with an inner face 

(4), an outer face (5) and an upper face (6). Either the 
inner face (4) or the outer face (5) is normal to the base, 

the other face being inclined relative thereto whereby the 
width of the lip (8) where it joins the base is narrower 

than the width of the upper face (6). 
A method of forming a horseshoe from the profile of the 
invention is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming 
clips on horseshoes and also to an elongate L-shaped 
metal member for use therewith. Clips are upward projections extending from the upper 
surface of the horseshoe adjacent its outer edges which 
are conventionally fitted in recesses formed by the 
Farrier in the horn of the horses hoof to prevent 
backward movement of the shoe in use. The front shoes 
normally have a single central clip whereas the rear 
shoes usually have two clips symmetrically disposed on 
each side of the fore and aft plane of symmetry of the 
shoe. The preparation of the clips requires the use of a hot 
forge. The operation involves heating the shoe to red 
heat and then punching an indentation in the 
undersurface of the shoe in the appropriate outer edge 
portion thereof to raise an appropriate volume of metal 
for the clip at the top surface. This is then beaten  
 
out on a anvil to form the clip. The forming of the 
clips on the shoe therefore represents a significant 
proportion of the Blacksmiths working time. Attempts have been made in the past to make horseshoes 
with clips already on them during the manufacture of 
the shoes. However, these methods have always 
involved hot working of the shoe by methods simulating 
the action of the Blacksmith. In particular, shoes 
have been made by forming the indentation by hot 
punching on a mechanical power press and subsequently 
rolling out the displaced metal with the shoe again at 
red heat using a mechanical power press. The handling 
of the hot shoes for these comparatively intricate 
machine operations requires a disproportionate amount 
of time and skill and the hot rolling produces a thin 
and flexible lip of metal which tends to adhere to the 
roller on its return stroke with the result that the 
clip curves outwardly and forwardly from the shoe which 
is the wrong orientation and therefore requires 
subsequent working before the shoe can be fitted to the 
horse.  
 Contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, the 
Applicants discovered that clips can be economically 
produced on a horseshoe by cold working techniques and 
their UK patent No.2.053.742 describes a method of 
forming a clip in a ferrous horseshoe in which an 
indentation is formed in the undersurface of the shoe 
in an appropriate outer edge portion thereof to raise 
an appropriate volume of metal for the clip at the top 
surface of the shoe and subsequently working the raised 
metal to form the clip, the invention being 
characterised in that the

<CLAIMS>
An elongate L-shaped metal member of constant cross 
section for forming into a horseshoe, characterised by a 

base (1) with an upstanding lip (8) along one edge thereof, 
the base being thicker and wider than the lip and said lip 

having an inner face (4), an outer face (5) and an upper 
face (6), one of said inner or outer faces providing a first 

face which is normal to the base and the other of said faces 
being inclined relative to the first face whereby the width 

of the lip (8) where it joins the base (1) is narrower than 
the width of the upper face (6) of the lip. 
An elongate metal member as claimed in claim 1 
characterised in that the outer face (5) of the lip (8) is 

normal to the base (1) and the inner face (4) is inclined 
relative thereto. 
An elongate metal member as claimed in claim 1 
characterised in that the inner face (4) of the lip (8) is 

normal to the base (1) and the outer face (5) is inclined 
relative thereto. 
An elongate metal member as claimed in claim 3 
characterised in that the inclined outer face (5) of the lip 

(8) meets the front face (5a) of the base at a location (7) 
slightly above the upper face (2) of the base (1).  

 
An elongate metal member as claimed in any preceding 
claim characterised in that the base (1) has a bottom 

surface (3) which has a recess formed therein. 
An elongate metal member as claimed in any of claims 1-4 
characterised in that the base (1) has a bottom surface 

(3) which is convexly curved. 
An elongate metal member as claimed in any preceding 
claim characterised in that said member is made of a rolled 

ferrous material. 
An elongate member as claimed in any preceding claim 
characterised in that said member is made of an extruded 

metal material. 
A method of cold forming a clip on a metal horseshoe 
comprising the steps of cold cutting material away from an 

upstanding lip (8) formed on an elongate L-shaped metal 
member of constant cross section to leave an amount of metal 

which provides an initial clip or tab configuration (10) and 
subsequently cold rolling said initial clip or tab to work 

it into its final clip configuration. 
A method as claimed in claim 9 characterised in that 
the cutting step is carried out using a power driven  

 
cropping tool.
