<ABSTRACT>
A bushing constituting a bus connection is 
divided to be assembled and when the divided bushing is 

assembled, a receiving portion for accommodating a 
coupling for buses is formed within the bushing. 

Accordingly, the coupling for buses is disposed in a 
position in which the receiving portion is to be formed 

in the divided state of the bushing and the bushing is 
then assembled to thereby obtain the bus connection 

having the coupling for buses accommodated in the 
receiving portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bus 
connection suitable for a T-connection for connecting 
buses between panel boards. A combined structure of a T-type bushing and 
cable-like buses is widely adopted as, for example, a T-type 
connection for connecting a cable to an equipment 
such as a GIS, a bus connection for a cubicle; a lead-in 
and lead-out cable connection and the like because of 
the economical efficiency, compactness and the 
convenience for handling. Fig. 13 is a perspective view illustrating a 
conventional bus connection of this type. In Fig. 13, the bus connection 1 includes a 
bushing 2 made of epoxy resins and a coupling 5 disposed 
within the bushing 2 and for connecting conductors of 
cable-like buses 3 by means of a sleeve-like internal 
electrode. A drawing-out rod 6 is connected to the 
coupling 5 to be electrically connected to an internal 
circuit of an equipment. When a plurality of bus connections having the 
above structure are put side by side and are connected 
to each other by means of buses, the following 
connecting method has been adopted heretofore. Fig. 14 illustrates the conventional bus 
connecting method. As illustrated in Fig. 14, two bus connections 
7A and 7B are disposed with a predetermined space and 
electrically connected to each other by means of a bus  
 
3. More particularly, the bus 3 is subjected to the 
terminal treatment that a conductor 4 within the bus 3 
is exposed at both ends thereof. The bus 3 is inserted 
into one bus connection 7A straight as shown by arrow 8 
and both ends of the bus 3 are then inserted into both 
of the bus connections 7A and 7B. As another method, for example, one end of the 
bus 3 is inserted into one bus connection 3 as shown by 
arrow 9 and the bus 3 is then moved into the opposite 
direction so that the other end of the bus 3 is inserted 
into the other bus connection 7B. Both of the above methods are adopted since 
the rigidity of the bus 3 is high and the bus 3 can not 
be bent easily. In the conventional connecting method 
described above, however, since it is necessary to 
insert the bus 3 into the bus connection, much labor and 
time are required for the connecting work and the 
connection order among the bus connections must be 
considered previously, so that the connecting work is 
troublesome. For example, when three or more bus 
connections are arranged lengthwise and the bus 
connections are connected to each other successively by 
means of buses 3, it is difficult to start the insertion 
work of the bus from
