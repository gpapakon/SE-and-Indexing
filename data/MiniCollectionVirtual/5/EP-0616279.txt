<ABSTRACT>
A selector 11 selects one of a plurality of 
reference clock signals based upon a selection 

signal. A hardware reset signal 103 is delayed by a 
predetermined time. The selection signal is sent to 

the selector responsive to a set signal. The 
sending of the selection signal is stopped 

responsive to the delayed hardware reset signal. 
The set signal is delayed by a predetermined time. 

A first flip-flop 13 is set in response to the 
hardware reset signal or a software reset signal, is 

supplied with the delayed set signal as a count 
input, and is supplied with low level as a data 

input. A second flip-flop 16 receives a logic AND 
signal of an output signal from the selector 11 and 

the hardware reset signal as a count input and 
receives a logic OR signal of the output of the 

first flip-flop 13 and an inverted output of the 
second flip-flop 16 as a count signal, and generates 

a clock output 
which is free of glitches when being stopped or started.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clock
generator and, more particularly, to a clock
generator capable of starting and stopping clock
signal transmission without intrusion of spike-like
sharp pulses.A conventional clock generator is not provided
with a function of starting and stopping clock
signal generation, but a function of stopping the
clock transmission immediately upon reception of a
reset signal.In such a conventional clock generator, upon
reception of the reset signal during the clock
transmission, the clock output level is immediately
fixed to a predetermined reset value. Therefore,
depending on the reception timing of the reset
signal, occurrence of the waveform deterioration
such as sharp spike pulses in the clock signal is
liable.An object of the present invention is therefore
to provide a clock generator capable of start and
stop of the clock signal transmission without any
waveform deterioration.WO 92 07316 A, US 4560939 A and EP 316943 A disclose prior art selectable-frequency
clock generators involving stopping clocks to avoid glitches and suchlike when the frequency
selection is changed. According to the present
invention, there is provided a clock generator
comprising a selector means for selecting one of a
plurality of reference clock signals based upon a 
selection signal, a first delay means for delaying a
hardware reset signal by a predetermined time, means
for sending the selection signal to the selector
means responsive to a set signal and initializing
the selection signal responsive to the
delayed hardware reset signal, a second delay means
for delaying the set signal by a predetermined time,
a first flip-flop means which is set in response to
the hardware reset signal or a software reset
signal, is supplied with the delayed set signal
through the second delay means as a clock input,and
is supplied with low level as a data input, and a
second flip-flop means which receives a logic AND
signal of an output signal from the selector means
and said hardware reset signal as a clock input and
receives a logic OR signal of the output of the
first flip-flop means and an inverted output of the
second flip-flop means as a data input, and generates a clock
output.In an embodiment a selector selects one of a plurality of
reference clock signals in response to a designation
from a clock source selection register which holds
data for selecting a reference clock signal. This
selected signal is provided to a second flip-flop.
Meanwhile, a first flip-flop detects a pulse, which
is produced as a
