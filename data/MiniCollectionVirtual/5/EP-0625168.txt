<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making a low density,
dimensionally-stable, extruded propylene polymer foam
blown with a blowing agent comprising partly or entirely
one or more inorganic blowing agents. The foam offers
excellent cushioning properties.Propylene polymer foams are known in the art,
and have been found useful in many applications such as
seen in U.S. Patent No. 3,481,455, 3,871,897, 3,932,569,
4,522,955, and 4,832,770. Such foams have been made
with a wide variety of organic and inorganic blowing
agents.Given current environmental concerns over the
use of organic blowing agents, it would be desirable to
have an extruded propylene polymer foam blown partly or
solely with inorganic blowing agents. It would be
further desirable to have such a dimensionally-stable,
low density foam (for example, 10 to 70 kilograms per
cubic meter) for use in cushioning applications. It
would also be desirable to have such a foam that is 
partially open-cell (for example, at least 5 percent)
since open-cell foams are easier to produce and
dimensionally more stable than corresponding closed-cell
foams.GB-A-0 989 521, US-A-3 407 151 and US-AS 506 037 disclose
a process for making a polypropylene foam by incorporating an inorganic blowing
agent into the polypropylene, which is then heated and extruded.According to the present invention, there is provided a 
process for making a dimensionally-stable, extruded
propylene polymer foam having a density of from 10 to 150 kilograms per
cubic meter the process comprising:
a) heating a propylene polymer material comprising
greater than 50 percent by weight propylene monomeric units to form a
melt polymer material;b) incorporating into the melt polymer material a blowing
agent containing at least 15 percent by weight of one or more inorganic
blowing agents to form a foamable gel;c) cooling the foamable gel to an optimum foaming
temperature; andd) extruding the foamable gel through a die to form the
foam, in the form of a plank and having an average cell wall thickness of
less than 35 micrometers.Suitable propylene polymer materials include
propylene homopolymers (polypropylene) and copolymers of
propylene and copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated
comonomers. The propylene polymer material may further
include non-propylenic polymers. The propylene polymer
material may be comprised solely of one or more
propylene homopolymers, one or more propylene 
copolymers, a blend of one or more of each of propylene
homopolymers and copolymers, or blends of any of the
foregoing
