<ABSTRACT>
A secure front-end communication system which couples a plurality of actively redundant process control computers to a computer network. The system includes a front end computer which is capable of establishing time limited communication contracts with one or more computer entity on the computer network. Each time limited communication contract is based upon an acceptable response to the transmission of an unpredicable signal from the front end computer, such as an encrypted transformation of a pseudo-random number generated by the front end computer. A security table is used to identify the network entities that are permitted to send write command messages to the process control computers to which the front end computer is connected. The front end computer also includes at least one permissive table which is used to determine whether a write command message from the network entity should be transmitted to the process control computer for which the message was intended.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of providing secure 
communications between a plurality of computers on a network on 
the basis of an acceptable response to the transmission of an 
unpredictable signal from one of said computers. The present 
invention further relates to a secure front end communication 
system for at least one process control computer which controls 
the operation of a physical process, including a computer network 
for enabling communication between a plurality of computers, and 
at least one computer entity connected to said computer network. Such a method and such a secure front end communication system are 
of high relevance, for instance, in chemical manufacturing plants 
or other relatively large processing plants, as will be understood 
from the following description of the general background of the 
invention.  
 In chemical manufacturing plants and other relatively large processing plants, a 
network of control computers and operator workstations may be needed to achieve 
automated control of an ongoing physical process in the plant. For example, the Jones et. al 
U.S. Patent No. 4,663,704, issued on May 5, 1987, shows a distributed processing system for a 
plant in which a single data highway connects all the various input/output terminals, data 
acquisition stations, control devices, record keeping devices and so forth. Similarly, the Henzel 
U.S. Patent No. 4,607,256, issued on August 19, 1986, shows a plant management system which 
utilizes a plant control bus for the purpose of transmitting data to physical computer modules 
on the network. In some of these process control computer networks, redundant process control 
computers are employed to enhance the reliability of the plant control and monitoring system. 
For example, the Fiebig et. al U.S. Patent No. 5,008,805, issued on April 16, 1991, shows a 
networked control system which includes a "hot standby" redundant processor that 
synchronously processes a control schedule table for comparison with control messages from a 
sender processor that are transmitted on the network. The redundant listener processor 
maintains a duplicate configuration in its memory ready to take over control of the system in 
the event of a failure of the sender processor. As another example, the McLaughlin et. al U.S. 
Patent No. 4,958,270, issued on September 18, 1990, shows a networked control system which 
employs a primary controller and a secondary controller. In order to maintain consistency 
between the primary data base and
