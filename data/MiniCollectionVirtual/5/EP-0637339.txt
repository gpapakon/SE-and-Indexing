<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chemically-inducible plant gene expression cassette and to plant cells transformed therewith. The expression cassette is suitable for use in any dicothyledonous or monocotyledonous plant. It comprises a first promoter operatively linked to a regulator sequence which encodes a regulator protein, and an inducible promoter operatively linked to a target gene, the inducible promoter being activated by the regulator protein in the presence of an effective exogenous inducer whereby application of the inducer causes expression of the target gene. The regulator sequence may be derived from the alcR gene, and the inducible promoter may be derived from the alcA gene promoter (both obtainable from Aspergillus nidulans)  A chimeric promoter comprising an upstream regulatory region and a heterologous downstream transcription initiation region is also disclosed. The regulatory sequence may be derived from the alcA gene promoter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA
constructs and plants incorporating them. In
particular, it relates to expression cassettes and
promoter sequences for the expression of genes in
plants.Gene expression is controlled by regions
upstream (5') of the protein encoding region,
commonly referred to as the "promoter". A promoter
may be constitutive, tissue-specific,
developmentally-programmed or inducible.Manipulation of crop plants to improve
characteristics (such as productivity or quality)
requires the expression of foreign or endogenous
genes in plant tissues. Such genetic manipulation
therefore relies on the availability of means to
control gene expression as required; for example,
on the availability and use of suitable promoters
which are effective in plants. It is advantageous
to have the choice of a variety of different
promoters so that the most suitable promoter may be
selected for a particular gene, construct, cell,
tissue, plant or environment. A range of promoters
are known to be operative in plants.Within the promoter region there are several
domains which are necessary for full function of
the promoter. The first of these domains lies
immediately upstream of the structural gene and
forms the "core promoter region" containing
consensus sequences, normally 70 base pairs 
immediately upstream of the gene. The core
promoter region contains the characteristic CAAT
and TATA boxes plus surrounding sequences, and
represents a transcription initiation sequence
which defines the transcription start point for the
structural gene. The precise length of the core
promoter region is indefinite but it is usually
well-recognisable. Such a region is normally
present, with some variation, in all promoters.
The base sequences lying between the various
well-characterised "boxes" appear not to be of
great importance.The presence of the core promoter region
defines a sequence as being a promoter: if the
region is absent, the promoter is non-functional.
Furthermore, the core promoter region is
insufficient to provide full promoter activity. A
series of regulatory sequences upstream of the core
constitute the remainder of the promoter. The
regulatory sequences determine expression level,
the spatial and temporal pattern of expression and,
for an important subset of promoters, expression
under inductive conditions.Several naturally-occurring promoters and
associated gene expression systems are known. The
best characterised regulatory systems are those of
bacteria in which the specific interactions between
DNA-binding
