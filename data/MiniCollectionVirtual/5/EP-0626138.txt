<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing ready-to-eat cereal flakes having edible 

particulate matter embedded therein and attached thereto. 
More specifically, the ready-to-eat cereal flake comprising 

cooked cereal grain and edible particulate matter embedded 
therein in a substantially uniform manner and additionally 

having edible particulate matter attached thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing ready-to-eat cereal flakes having edible
particulate matter embedded therein and attached thereto.Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals in flake form have
been produced by cereal companies for years. These cereal
flakes typically contain cereal grains such as wheat,
rice, oats, corn, etc. The cereal flakes also contain a
number of ancillary ingredients such as vitamins for
fortification, sugars, salts, natural and artificial
flavoring agents and other agents such as oils, coloring
agents and natural and artificial preservatives. In
addition to the ingredients incorporated into the cereal
flake itself, other separate ingredients are included with
the cereal flake in the cereal produce as packaged and
sold to the consumer. Examples of such added ingredients
include nuts and nut pieces, fruit and fruit pieces, etc.
These added ingredients are typically included to impart
desirable flavor and texture properties to the packaged
cereal product.However, there are several problems which arise
when combining such added ingredients with the cereal
flakes in the packaged cereal product. One problem is
that the added nuts and nut pieces and fruit and fruit
pieces are not uniformly distributed throughout the cereal
package. This is due to several factors, the primary
factor being that the cereal and added ingredients are
typically introduced to the packaged cereal product from
separate process streams, and thus tend to remain separate
upon packaging. Another source of this non-uniform
distribution is unequal settling rates due to the
differing densities of the cereal flakes and the added
ingredients. The ingredient having the greater density
tends to settle faster than the ingredient having the
lesser density. This lack of uniform distribution of
flakes and added ingredients is undesirable because the
cereal product, when consumed, does not provide a uniform 
taste sensation, which would be preferred. While it may
be possible to remedy this separation problem by
mechanically manipulating the cereal flakes and added
ingredients to achieve greater mixing, such a solution
carries the risk of physically damaging the cereal flakes.The art teaches preparing cereal flakes via a
process which utilizes an extrusion step. The article
"Twin Screw Extrusion of Corn Flakes", T. Midden, Cereal
Foods World, Vol. 34, No. 11, pp. 941-943 (1989), teaches
a method for preparing corn flakes wherein the flake
ingredients are batch mixed and fed into an extruder. In
the extruder, the

A process for preparing ready-to-eat cereal
flakes having edible particulate matter embedded therein,

said process being 
characterized by
:

(a) preparing a dry mix comprising cereal grain and
a plasticizer;
(b) introducing the dry mix and water into an
initial cooking and forming step under conditions

sufficient to produce a cooked cereal dough product;
(c) introducing edible particulate matter and the
cooked cereal dough product into a secondary forming step

under conditions sufficient to form a secondary cereal
dough product having edible particulate matter embedded

therein; and
(d) converting the secondary cereal dough product
into flakes.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the initial cooking and forming step is carried
out in a twin-screw initial extruder and the secondary

forming step is carried out in a separate, single-screw
forming extruder.
A process according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 the throughput of the initial extruder is in the
range of from 22.5 to 2,720 kilograms cooked cereal dough

product per hour, and the dry mix/water mixture is cooked
in the initial extruder at a temperature of from 120

degrees C to 205 degrees C for a period of from 15
seconds to 75 seconds.
A process according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 from 0.10 to 0.40 kg. edible particulate matter 
per kg. cooked cereal dough product is added to the

forming extruder.
A process according to claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the cooked cereal dough product/edible
particulate matter mixture in the forming extruder is

maintained at a temperature of from 25 degrees C to 100
degrees C for a period of from 0.5 to 5 minutes. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 the cereal grain in the dry mix
comprises oat cereal grain and wheat cereal grain and

wherein the plasticizer is sucrose.
A process according to claim 6, 
characterized
in that
 the dry mix comprises from 40% to 60% by weight
oat cereal grain, from 35% to 55% by weight wheat cereal

grain, and from 1% to 10% by weight sucrose.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the amount of water added to the
initial cooking and forming step is in the range of from

3% to 36% by weight of the total dry mix.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 the edible particulate matter is
selected from granola, fruit and fruit pieces, dehydrated

fruit and fruit pieces, raw oat particles, and mixtures
thereof.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that
 the secondary cereal dough product
has a moisture content of from 18% to 30% by weight.
A process according to any of claims 1 to
10, 
characterized in that
 the secondary cereal dough product is conveyed to the
flaking step via pneumatic conveyance.
