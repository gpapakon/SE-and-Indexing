<ABSTRACT>
An electromechanical actuator for controlling a flow modulator which is pivotably mounted in a pipe to cause a rapidly variable head loss in a fluid flowing therein, said actuator being provided with a stator and a rotor. The rotor (7) can move only through a predetermined angular sector by oscillating about an angular reference position, and a recoil device (12) is provided for storing the kinetic energy of the rotor (7) and flow modulator during angular deceleration of the rotor, and at least partially returning said energy to the actuator during angular acceleration of said rotor (7).

Electromagnetic actuator for controlling a flow 
regulator of the vane type (2) which is mounted so that 

it can pivot inside a pipe (1) and which is designed to 
create a very rapidly variable head loss in a fluid 

flowing inside the pipe, the actuator (2,4,5,7,8) 
including a stationary part or stator (8), and a part 

mounted so that it can rotate, or rotor (7), rotationally 
secured to the flow regulator (2), the stator and the 

rotor being equipped with electromagnetic elements (7

permanent magnets, which, when a current passes through 

them, are in a situation of electromagnetic interaction 
which generates angular displacements of the rotor (7) 

solely within a predetermined angular sector, 
characterized in that it oscillates inside the pipe (1) 

and in that it is equipped with a return device (12-16) 

which, during the oscillations of the rotor about an 
angular reference position, stores up the kinetic energy 

of the rotor (7) and of the flow regulator (2) during the 
angular decelerations of the rotor (7) and restores it, 

at least in part, to the actuator (2,4,5,7,8) during the 
angular accelerations of the rotor (7), the operating 

frequency of the rotor (7) being close to the resonant 
frequency of the actuator (2,4,5,7,8). 
Actuator according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it includes adjustment means capable of shifting the 

angular reference position of the rotor (7) relative to 
the pipe (1) to make it coincide substantially with the 

mean angular position of the flow regulator (2) oscillating  
 

inside the pipe (1). 
Actuator according to either one of Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the angular sector within 

which the rotor (7) oscillates lies between approximately 
15 and 35 degrees and, preferably, between approximately 

20 and 30 degrees. 
Actuator according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the return device (12-15) is of the 

electromagnetic type and includes a sensor (15) for 
measuring the angular position of the rotor (7), electromagnetic 

elements (7

electric circuit and located on the rotor (7) and on the 

stator (8) and an electric accumulator (13) which stores 
up the amount of electricity produced in the said 

electric circuit during the angular decelerations of the 
rotor (7) and which supplies the actuator (4) with 

electrical energy during the angular accelerations of the 
rotor (7). 
Actuator according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the electric circuit of the return device (12-15) 

consists of the electric circuit of the actuator (4), 
switching means (12) making it possible to switch this 

circuit into an actuating position or into a position for 
recovering electrical energy. 
Actuator according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the return device (16) is of the 

mechanical type and includes an elastic member (16) 
secured to the rotor (7) on the one hand, and to the 

stator (8) on the other hand. 
Actuator according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it includes both an electromagnetic 

return device (12-15) according to any one of Claims 4 
and 5, and a mechanical return device (16) according to 

Claim 6. 
Actuator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it includes a position of 

rest corresponding to a position of the flow regulator 
(2) which is safe in the event of malfunction of the 

actuator (4).
