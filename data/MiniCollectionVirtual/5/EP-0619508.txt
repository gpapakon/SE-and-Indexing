<ABSTRACT>
An optical fibre cable comprises a fibre having a 
core (4) and a surrounding cladding (9). At least one of 

the contact ends of the core (4) is provided with a rod 
(1) of larger diameter than the core. At this end, the 

fibre has a reflector (7) designed to conduct rays entering 
outside the fibre towards an area (6) where they can 

be absorbed without causing any damage, the rod (1) being 
so designed that rays not linked into the fibre are conducted 

towards the reflector (7). A method for transmitting 
light by using the optical fibre cable is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fibre
cable which comprises a fibre having a core and a surrounding
cladding and which is suited for transmitting
high-power laser light. At least one of the contact ends
of the fibre has means for deflecting light outside the
core towards an area where it can be absorbed without
causing any damage. The invention also concerns the use
of such a fibre.Normally, an optical fibre cable includes a fibre
which consists of a core and a surrounding cladding. To
facilitate handling, the cladding should be surrounded by
a protective covering. The radiation is conducted in the
core, whose refractive index differs from that of the
cladding. In a step index optical fibre, total internal
reflection in the interface is achieved as long as the
angle of incidence of the radiation does not exceed a
critical angle referred to as the numerical aperture of
the fibre. In a graded index optical fibre, the refractive
index of the core is distributed, mostly as a parabolic
function, and the numerical aperture depends on where the
ray impinges upon the end surface. The highest numerical
aperture is attained at the centre of the fibre, and this
value is indicated in the fibre specification. In all
cases, the cladding should be substantially free from
radiation. Normally, the refractive index of the core is
higher than that of the cladding, and the numerical aperture
is determined by this difference in refractive index.In the transmission of high-power laser light, radiation
in the cladding may cause serious problems, since it
is eventually absorbed in the covering, resulting in considerable
heat generation and damage to the fibre cable.
Radiation in the cladding may, for instance, arise as a
result of light scattering in the end surface of the
fibre, e.g. caused by scratches or dust particles, or as
a result of some of the incident radiation quite simply 
falling outside the numerical aperture of the fibre. These
problems are most severe at the inlet and outlet ends of
the fibre cable, where the reflection of incoming and outgoing
radiation, as well as the absorption of dust particles
and the like, gives rise to harmful heat generation.
At the outlet end, radiation can be reflected from
the workpiece directly into the cladding or fall completely
outside the fibre. In both cases, the radiation is
finally absorbed in the covering and heat is generated.US Patent 4,678,273 (corresponding to SE Patent
443,454) discloses an optical fibre surrounded by a
radiation-proof transmitting material
