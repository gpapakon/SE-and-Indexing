<ABSTRACT>
A surface-imaging technique for lithographic processes is disclosed. 
The lithographic processes are used to manufacture integrated circuit devices. An 

image is produced on a resist that is applied onto a substrate. The image is produced 
by exposing selected regions of the resist material to radiation. The selected exposed 

regions correspond to the image. The resist is then exposed to a silylating reagent 
that selectively reacts with either the exposed or the unexposed region of the resist. 

The silylated resist is then subjected to reactive ion etching, which forms an 
in
situ
 
silicon oxide etch mask over the silylated regions of the resist. The mask so formed 

provides etching selectivity which provides precise image transfer from the resist 
into the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the insitu formation of an etch mask by using 
silylating reagents in a lithographic process for device fabrication. The process 
employs surface-imaging techniques to obtain devices that satisfy fine design rules. Design rules for integrated circuit manufacture are becoming 
increasingly fine. Design rules of 0.5 µm are being replaced by design rules that are 
less than 0.5 µm. These increasingly fine design rules require processes which can 
transfer these features into the integrated circuit with concomitant accuracy. Integrated circuits are manufactured using lithographic processes. A 
lithographic process employs energy that is introduced onto selected portions of an 
energy sensitive resist material overlying a substrate. Energy is introduced onto 
selected portions of the resist through openings in a mask substrate interposed 
between the energy source and the resist material. These openings in the mask 
substrate define the pattern. The pattern is transferred into the resist material by the 
energy that is permitted to pass through the openings in the mask substrate and into 
the resist. Thus, it is an image of the pattern defined by the mask substrate that is 
transferred into the resist material. After the image is transferred into the resist material, the resist material 
is developed to form a pattern. The pattern is then transferred by etching into the 
substrate underlying the resist material. Once the pattern is incorporated into the 
substrate, it becomes a feature of the integrated circuit. The energy used to expose the resist material, the composition of the 
resist material, the thickness of the resist material, and many other factors affect the 
ability of a lithographic process to delineate a feature in a substrate. The smaller the 
design rule, the more precisely the feature must be delineated. Another factor which affects the ability of a process to define features in 
a substrate is the topography of the substrate surface. Substrate surface topography 
is either planar or non-planar. Non-planar surfaces are referred to as such because 
their surfaces are not in one single plane. When a resist material is applied over a 
non-planar substrate, the resist layer only approximately conforms to the non-planar 
substrate surface. As a result, the distance between the resist surface and the  
 
substrate surface tends to be nonuniform. This nonuniformity can adversely affect 
the pattern developed in a resist material because the depth at which the image is
