<ABSTRACT>
A device for moving protective screens, applicable to industrial 
mixers and similar equipment, composed of a boiler installed on 

a boiler support and fitted with a protective screen, the boiler 
support and the protective screen being movable by a boiler lifting 

lever attached to a shaft which in turn is attached to a 
set of short connecting rods which engage a set of long connecting 

rods joined to two supporting pins for guiding the upward 
motion of the boiler, and having a microswift acting in conjunction 

with two guide pins in the protective screen, characterized 
by the device being fitted with two guide members (12) with two 

flexible cables (13) extending therethrough to engage the upper 
ends of the guide pins (10) and the supporting pins (11), the 

protective screen and the boiler being movable by means of the 
lever (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a utility model 
involving a mechanism for moving protective screens, 
applicable to industrial mixers and similar equipment, the 
obvious purpose being to provide motion to a protective 
screen installed on a boiler facility incorporating an 
industrial or household mixer, thereby avoiding possible 
harm to the operator's hands during operation of the mixer 
as a result of the protective screen not being in place. This invention is applicable to the field of 
industrial mixers and similar products. Facilities designed to aid in the operation of 
raising and lowering a boiler on which mixing operations 
are carried out, homogenized by the use of mixers, are 
known to be in use for a long time. The specific function of this operation is to 
facilitate the introduction or removal of the tools used 
for the above activity, as well as emptying or extracting 
the boiler itself. Generally speaking, the mechanisms used are manually 
operated through a lever acting on a shaft which causes the 
protective screen to be raised or lowered, acting in 
conjunction with two sets of short and long connecting 
rods, the latter being drawn by the short rods. The long  
 
rods engage two guide members which are thus moved to a 
vertical position, thereby drawing on the boiler and boiler 
support. Recent European safety regulations compulsorily 
require manufacturers of this type of machinery to 
incorporate a safety screen to prevent the operator access 
inside the boiler facility while the mixer is in operation. The first screens to appear on the market were hand 
operated, i.e. the lever was first handled to raise or 
lower the boiler and then the separating screen was opened 
or closed, although this was never done while the mixer was 
in operation. All movable screens installed in this type of 
facility are fitted with a microswitch designed to stop the 
mixer automatically in the event that the screen is opened, 
thus preventing the operator from inadvertently putting his 
hands inside the facility with the mixer in operation. This 
means that when the screen is not in place in the closed 
position, the mixer is off. In view that this operation is considered to be time 
consuming, many operators disconnect the mechanism and 
consequently work without the benefit of the protective 
screen device. The obvious solution to the current problem is to 
provide a fully simplified mechanism for driving the 
protective screen, applicable to industrial mixers and 
similar equipment, designed to

A device for moving protective screens according 
to claim 1, applicable to industrial mixers and similar 

equipment, characterized by the upward movement of the 
supporting pins (11) engaging the boiler support (2), which 

causes a sliding motion of the flexible cables (13) through 
the guide members (12), pushing the guide pins (10) 

attached to the protective screen (9) downward, thus 
lowering the screen. 
A device for moving protective screens according 
to the precedi
ng claims, applicable to industrial mixers 
and similar equipment, characterized by the downward 

movement of the boiler (3) moving mechanism, which causes 
the supporting pins (11) to draw on the flexible cables 

(13), resulting in an upward sliding motion of the guide 
pins (10) and consequently of the protective screen (2).
