<ABSTRACT>
In an electric power steering apparatus, in which an 
electric motor for assisting the steering torque is adapted 

to be driven by PWM wave, and the duty of the PWM wave is 
adapted to be under the feedback control in time series by 

detecting the driving current of the motor, when the direction 
of the target current in this time for the feedback 

control is different from that of the former time, or when 
the detected driving current in the motor is zero, the 

former target voltage of the motor for the feedback control 
is forcibly set to the voltage value decided in reference to 

the minimum duty of the PWM wave for driving the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus which employs an electric motor to 
provide power to assist the steering force for a vehicle. The electric power steering apparatus serves to detect 
the steering torque and to assist the steering force by the 
rotation of an electric motor to be driven according to the 
detected torque. FIG.1 is a block diagram showing an outline construction 
of the electric power steering apparatus. The output 
of a torque sensor 2 provided on a steering shaft (not 
shown) is inputted through an interface 3 into a CPU 1, 
wherein first the A/D conversion (11) is carried out, then 
the phase compensation (12) performed. The output of a 
vehicle speed sensor 7 is also inputted into CPU 1. In a 
memory of the CPU 1, there is stored a table (13) of the 
relations between the detected torques and vehicle speeds 
and the target current values of the drive current for an 
electric motor 5, and the target current corresponding to 
the inputted torque and vehicle speed is read out. Also,  
 
the output of A/D conversion is differentiated (18), and 
this result is added to the read-out target current (14). 
The addition of the differentiated value is for the purpose 
of the inertial compensation of the motor 5. In the CPU 1, the deviation is calculated (15) between 
the added result and the feedback drive current of the motor 
5 which is detected by a drive current detector 6 and the 
A/D conversion (19) is carried out in the CPU 1. The deviation 
is dealt in the PI calculation (16), thereby the 
control variable is calculated, and the PWM wave signal 
corresponding to the variable and the signal indicating the 
rotary direction of the motor 5 are made out (17). Those 
signals are given to a driving circuit 4 which is constructed 
as an H-type bridge of four switch transistors 
together with the motor 5. FIG.2 is a flow chart showing the operating steps of 
the conventional PI calculation (16) in the CPU 1. The 
difference ΔIn is obtained between the target current 
IM as the added result 14 and the detected driving current 
Is of the motor 5 (S1). Next, the integral element In is 
calculated (S2) as follows; 
In = ΔIn x KI (KI : constant) 
Next, the difference ΔPn is calculated between ΔIn 
and the former difference ΔIn-1 (S3) as follows; 
ΔPn = ΔIn - ΔIn-1  
 
then, the proportional element Pn is calculated as follows 
(S4); 
Pn = ΔPn x KP (KP : constant) 
And, the target voltage value VM to be given to the 
motor 5 is calculated (S5) as follows; 
VM =
