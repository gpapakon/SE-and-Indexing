<ABSTRACT>
A sphygmomanometer cuff has inflatable, different-sized 
chambers (2,3), each having an air-supply duct (10,11). 

A selector valve means (14) has a number of manually 
adjustable valve positions, corresponding in number to 

the chambers, and has one side connected to the air-supply 
ducts (10,11) of the chambers and another side connectible 

to an air pump (17). When the sphygmomanometer 
cuff is applied in position round an arm (40) or a thigh 

for measuring the blood pressure, indicating means (31-34) 
give the user a visual indication ("CHOOSE 12","CHOOSE 15"), 

which depends on the circumference of the 
arm or the thigh, for manually adjusting the selector 

valve means (14) to a valve position permitting selective 
inflation of a chamber of suitable size in view of 

the circumference of the arm or the thigh at issue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sphygmomanometer cuff 
comprising two or more separately inflatable, 
different-sized chambers, each having an air-supply 
duct. A sphygmomanometer cuff usually consists of an 
inner flexible bladder with one or more connecting 
hoses, and a surrounding cover provided with Velcro™ 
fasteners or the like enabling the cuff to be fixed 
round an arm or a thigh when the blood pressure is to be 
measured. Normally, an air pump or the like and a manometer 
are also associated to the cuff. The sphygmomanometer cuff most frequently used today 
has an inner bladder with a single inflatable chamber. 
To enable correct reading of the blood pressure, 
the user has to choose a cuff whose bladder is of the 
right size, i.e. a bladder of which above all the width 
is suited to the circumference of the arm or the thigh. 
According to European standards in course of preparation, 
the optimal dimensions of a bladder in a sphygmomanometer 
cuff are the following: 
Width:40% of the circumference Length:80-100% of the circumference. The prior art encompasses a single-chamber sphygmomanometer 
cuff in which the inside of the cover is provided 
with marks relating to suitable cuff sizes. With 
the aid of these marks, the user is, when applying the 
cuff, able to establish whether the cuff has the right 
size or is too large or too small, in which case it has 
to be replaced with a cuff whose bladder is of another 
size. However, there is still a risk that the user will 
choose a wrong-sized cuff, despite the marks provided. 
One reason may be that the circumference of the arm or 
the thigh at issue is just outside the size interval for  
 
which the cuff is intended. Under these circumstances, 
the user may, e.g. if a cuff of the right size is not 
readily available or is being used by someone else, 
choose a cuff of the wrong size, resulting in incorrect 
reading of the blood pressure. Furthermore, EP-B1-0 136 279 teaches a sphygmomanometer 
cuff of the type stated by way of introduction, 
which has several overlapping and different-sized chambers. This EP patent also calls attention to the fact 
that the single-chamber cuff involves the risk of 
inaccurate measurements, which means that a patient may 
be given e.g. antihypertensive medicine by mistake. In 
the sphygmomanometer cuff according to EP-B1-0 136 279, 
one chamber of several chambers in the bladder is automatically 
selected. This is achieved by providing a 
branch system of hoses connected to the respective chambers, 
as well as a

<CLAIMS>
A sphygmomanometer cuff comprising two or more 
separately inflatable, different-sized chambers (2, 3), 

each having an air-supply duct (10, 11), and 
a selector valve means (14), which has a number of 

manually adjustable valve positions, corresponding in 
number to the chambers, and which has one side (12, 13) 

connected to the air-supply ducts (10, 11) of the chambers 
(2, 3) and another side (15) connectible to an air 

pump (17), 
characterised by
 
   indicating means (31-34) which, when the sphygmomanometer 

cuff is applied in position round an arm (40) or 
a thigh for measuring the blood pressure, give the user 

a visual indication, which depends on the circumference 
of the arm or the thigh, for manually adjusting the 

selector valve means (14) to a valve position permitting 
selective inflation of a chamber of suitable size in 

view of the circumference of the arm or the thigh at 
issue. 
The cuff of claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that the indicating means (31-34) comprise interval 

marks (31a, 33a; 31b, 33b provided on the outside (25) 
of the cuff and each corresponding to a chamber (2, 3), 

as well as a pointer (34) which projects from one 
longitudinal edge (30) of the cuff and which, when the 

cuff is applied in position round an arm (40) or a thigh 
for measuring the blood pressure, is located within an 

area where the cuff ends (26, 29) overlap and within a 
then visible interval mark (31a, 33a; 31b, 33b) corresponding 

to the circumference at issue. 
The cuff of claim 2, 
characterised
 
in that the pointer (34) essentially is an extension of 

the inner terminal edge (26) of the cuff.  
 
The cuff of claim 2 or 3, 
characterised
 
in that the selector valve means (14) for each 

of its valve positions is provided with a position mark 
(35a, 35b) corresponding to the respective interval 

marks (31a, 33a; 31b, 33b) on the cuff. 
The cuff of any one of claims 2-4, 
characterised
 
in that the interval marks (31a, 33a; 

31b, 33b) are arranged on a flap (31) projecting from 
the longitudinal edge (30) of the cuff, and that the 

pointer (34) projects farther from the longitudinal edge 
(30) of the cuff than does the flap (31), such that the 

pointer (34) projects behind the flap (31) when the cuff 
is applied in position round an arm or a thigh. 
The cuff of any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised
 in that the selector valve 
means (14), in addition to the valve positions enabling 

selective inflation of the corresponding chambers, has a 
neutral position preventing inflation of the chambers. 
The cuff of claim 6, 
characterised
 
in that the selector valve means (14) is adapted to occupy 

the neutral position when air is to be discharged 
from the cuff after use. 
The cuff of any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised
 in that the selector valve 

means (14) has a collecting chamber (58) communicating 
with the air pump (17), and a valve member (57) which, 

depending on the valve position set, opens or blocks the 
passage between the collecting chamber (58) and the air-supply 

ducts (51-53) of the chambers. 
The cuff of claim 8, 
characterised

(55) opening in the collecting chamber 58 and adapted to 
be connected to a manometer (18). 
The cuff of any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised

are formed of one and the same flexible bladder (1), and  

 
that it further has a cover
