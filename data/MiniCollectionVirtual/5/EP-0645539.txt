<ABSTRACT>
A control valve for a variable rotary vane 
compressor is modular. The control operates an actuator 

to vary the position of a rotary valve plate located 
between the intake chamber and the compression chamber. 

The control valve locates in a cavity which has a suction 
pressure portion, a control pressure portion, and a 

discharge pressure portion. The control valve has an end 
cap and a valve seat member connected together by a 

sleeve. A valve element engages a seat in the valve seat 
member. The spring and a bias pin urge the valve element 

to the closed position. A bellows located within the 
sleeve has a stem that contacts the valve element to move 

it off of the seat. The sleeve allows the distance 
between the valve seat member and the end cap to be 

varied to preset the bellows prior to installation in the 
compressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to variable
capacity rotary vane compressors for air conditioning
systems, particularly for vehicles, and in particular
to improvements in a control valve for that type of
compressor.One type of automotive air conditioning compressor
in use is a variable capacity vane compressor. In this
type of compressor, a compression housing has a chamber
that is oval in shape. A cylindrical rotor extends
through the chamber. The rotor has radial vanes mounted
to it which slide radially in slots formed in the rotor.
Refrigerant at suction pressure enters the compression
chamber, with the vanes compressing the refrigerant,
which passes outward through a valve.The compressor demand varies according to speed and
atmosphere conditions. At highway speed, the demand is
usually lower than while idling on a hot day. To vary
the capacity, a rotary valve disk or plate mounts in
front of the compression housing and in engagement with
a shoulder on the compression housing. The valve plate
has a slotted perimeter which will change the position of
the opening from the intake chamber into the compression
chamber depending upon the rotational position of the
valve plate. The valve plate is rotatably carried in a
rotary valve housing, also known as a rear side block. 
The particular rotational position of the valve plate
will change the quantity of refrigerant introduced
between the vanes for compression by changing the timing
of the compression cycle.An actuator will rotate the valve plate to selected
positions depending upon the changes in the discharge
pressure and the intake or suction pressure. In one
type, such as shown in U.S. Patent 5,145,327, the
actuator member comprises radial projections mounted to
the rear side of the rotary valve plate and located
within chambers. Each projection serves as a piston.
Variable fluid pressure is applied to both sides of each
piston. Also, a spring will urge the plate to a minimum
delivery position.In another type of actuator, the rotary valve plate
is rotated by a spool piston, such as shown in U.S.
Patent 4,838,740. The spool piston moves linearly
transverse to the axis of the rotor. The spool piston
has a pivot pin that engages the plate to cause it to
rotate as the spool piston moves.A control valve applies pressure to the actuator for
controlling the position of the rotary valve plate in
response to intake and discharge pressures. In one type,
the control valve supplies a control pressure to one side
of the actuator piston, the other side of the
