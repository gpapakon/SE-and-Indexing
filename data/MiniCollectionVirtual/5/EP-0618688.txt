<ABSTRACT>
The reliability and availability of a data transmission radio system between at least one mobile station and n fixed base stations arranged along a route are improved according to the invention by dividing the n base stations into m groups where 1
<
m
<
/=n. They have a radio link with the mobile station which moves along the route. The n base stations transmit first radio signals on m different first frequencies, base stations which belong to the same group transmitting on the same frequency, and base stations which belong to different groups transmitting on different frequencies. The mobile station transmits second radio signals on m different second frequencies. All n base stations receive the second radio signals on all m second frequencies and the mobile station receives the first radio signals on all m first frequencies. The base stations of each of the m groups are in each case interlinked in the form of a base station chain via a group-individual modulation feeder and the ends of these m chains which are independent of one another are linked with a radio switching centre. Base stations which are directly adjacent along the route always belong to different groups.
