<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides new compounds of formula (I) wherein, subject to a proviso, n is zero or an integer of 1 to 3; each of R and R1, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl or C1-C4 alkoxy; R2 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl optionally substituted by hydroxy; each of R3 and R4 independently is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and of formula (IA), wherein R5 is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl or C1-C4 alkoxy, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which are active on the central nervous system (CNS) and can be used in therapy as anti-epileptics, anti-Parkinson, neuroprotective, antidepressant, anti-spastic and hypnotic agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substituted
(phenylalkoxybenzyl)aminopropanamide derivatives, to
their use as therapeutic agents, to a process for their
preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing
them.
Other N-substituted α-amino carboxamide derivatives are
known as having pharmacological properties, for instance
those described by British patent No. 1140748. The
compounds according to this prior art document are useful
in the treatment and prophylaxis of such diseases as
coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis; moreover
they are useful in the treatment of inflammatory
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Further substituted amino acid derivatives are known as
enkephalinase inhibitors, analgesics and hypotensives
from EP-A-0038758.
Still other substituted glycine and alanine derivatives
are disclosed by US-A-4049663. The compounds according to
this document have utility as oral analgesics.WO-90/14334 discloses N-phenylalkyl substituted α-aminocarboxamide
derivatives active on the central 
nervous system.
It has now been found that novel substituted (aryl-alkoxybenzyl)aminopropanamide
derivatives as herein
defined, falling in part within the broad formula (I) of
WO 90/14334, have valuable biological properties, in
particular as anti-epileptic, anti-Parkinson,
neuroprotective, antidepressant, antispastic, and/or
hypnotic agents.Accordingly, the present invention provides a new
compound of formula (I)

wherein
n is zero or an integer of 1 to 3;R is halogen;R2 is C1-C4 alkyl
or -CH2OH;each of R3 and R4 is hydrogen; or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof; and wherein when
R2 is -CH2OH then n is 1.A -(CH2)n- group may be a branched or straight alkylene
chain.
A halogen atom is preferably fluorine, chlorine or
bromine, in particular fluorine or chlorine.A C1-C4 alkyl group may be a branched or straight group,
typically methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl or
tert-butyl, preferably methyl or ethyl.Specific examples of preferred compounds of the invention 
are:
2-{4-[2-(2-fluorophenyl)ethyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[2-(3-fluorophenyl)ethyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(2-fluorophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(3-fluorophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(2-chlorophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(3-chlorophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(2-bromophenyl)propyl]oxybenzyl}aminopropanamide;2-{4-[3-(
