Safety device against the overpressure failure of 
a nuclear reactor pressure vessel in the event of insufficient 

core cooling, having the following features: a 
pressure-relief fitting (22), which is inserted into a 

wall or pipeline (10) of the pressure vessel (1), the 
said wall or pipeline being exposed to the primary 

pressure, and which is loaded with differential pressure, 
has a closing piece (23) which is mounted in a hollow 

guide cylinder (31) so as to be movable in a longitudinally 
displaceable manner and is a differential-pressure 

piston designed as a hollow body and which is held, 
sealed off, in its closing position by a fusible solder 

retention (24, 25), but can be moved into its opening 
position when an upper limit temperature is reached in 

the reactor interior, the said limit temperature causing 
the fusible solder retention (24, 25) to melt open on 

account of a limit-temperature heat flow reaching the 
latter. 
Safety device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the pressure-relief fitting (22) is connected to 

a blow-off conduit (28) opening into a blow-off vessel. 
Safety device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the fusible solder retention (24) is attached 

between sealing faces (23.1) of the closing piece (23) 
and associated seat faces (29) of the pressure-relief 

fitting (22). 
Safety device according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that, in the case of a differential-pressure piston, 

the fusible solder retention (25) is additionally 
arranged between piston circumferential faces (23.2) and  

 
guide faces (30) on the inner circumference of the guide 

cylinder (31). 
Safety device according to Claim 1 or 4, characterized 
in that the guide cylinder (31) is held, centred, 

in the fitting housing (220), in such a way that an 
annular channel (27) remains free as an overflow channel 

between the outer circumference of the guide cylinder 
(31) and the inner circumference of the fitting housing, 

in that guide vanes (32) holding the guide cylinder (31) 
centrically are arranged in the annular channel (27) and 

are connected to the wall of the fitting housing (220), 
and in that the inlet cross-section of the overflow 

channel (27) is sealed off by the differential-pressure 
piston (23) in the normal position of the latter, but is 

opened in its release position. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1, 4 or 
5, characterized in that the guide cylinder (31) has, at 

its end facing away from the piston, a bottom (33) with 
a pressure-relief orifice (34). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the pressure-relief fitting (22) is 

inserted into the wall of a main coolant conduit (10) 
near the nuclear reactor pressure vessel (1). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the pressure-relief fitting (22) is 

inserted into the wall of the pressure vessel (1) at the 
height of and between the connection pieces (4, 9) of the 

main coolant conduit. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, in the event of appropriately 

smaller cross-sectional dimensions of the pressure-relief 
fitting (22) and of the conduits connected to the latter, 

the pressure-relief conduit is designed as a control 
conduit (28') for a separate blow-off valve (36).
