<ABSTRACT>
A surface fastener molded of synthetic resin, 
comprises: a plate-like substrate (1); and a multiplicity 

of hooks (2) formed on one surface of the substrate (1) 
integrally, each of the hooks (2) being composed of a rising 

portion (21) having a front surface (24) rising from the 
substrate (1), a rear surface (23) rising obliquely from the 

substrate (1) along a smooth curved line and a reinforcing 
rib (2a) located on at least one side surface, and a hook-shape 

engaging portion (22) extending forwardly from a 
distal end of the rising portion (21). After the molding, 

the plate-like substrate (1) is biaxially stretched to have 
a smaller thickness and, at the same time, to increase the 

toughness in substantially all directions of the substrate 
(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface fastener in which
a plate-like substrate and a multiplicity of hooks are continuously
and integrally molded by extrusion, and more
particularly to a molded surface fastener in which the plate-like
substrate is thin and flexible and has adequate toughness
in all directions.A hooked surface fastener has been known long since
in which hooks are formed by cutting loops of monofilaments
woven into a woven cloth. With this type of surface fastener,
softness of the woven cloth and softness of the monofilaments
combine to make a very smooth touch when the hooks come into
and out of engagement with loops of the companion fastener
member. Additionally, since the monofilaments forming hooks
are treated with drawing process, they are excellent in
toughness against pulling and bending though small in cross-sectional
area. Further, since the hooks can be formed in
high density depending on the structure of the woven cloth,
this type of surface fastener has a high engaging rate and
hence can survive in repeated use. However, with this
woven-cloth-type surface fastener, partly since the quantity 
of material is large and partly since a large number of process
steps are required, it is difficult to reduce the cost
of production.To this end, an alternative molded surface fastener
has been developed in which the substrate and the hooks are
simultaneously and integrally molded by extrusion. The
molding technology for this kind of surface fastener is disclosed
in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO
48-22768, Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 52-37414, U.S.
Pat. No. 3,312,583, and International Patent Japanese Publication
No. HEI 1-501775.According to the technology disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publications Nos. SHO 48-22768 and SHO 52-37414, the
substrate and the hooks can be molded integrally and continuously
by extrusion. This molding method comprises steps
of arranging a large number of mold discs and a large number
of spacer plates alternately one over another to form a
laminate drum, extruding a thermoplastic resin in a molten
form onto the peripheral surface of the drum in rotation to
force the resin into hook-forming cavities of the mold discs,
compressing the resin painted over the drum surface to form
a substrate, cooling the substrate and hooks, retracting the
spacer plates radially inwardly, and peeling a completed
belt-like surface fastener continuously from the drum surface.
Each of the mold discs has in one side surface a 
multiplicity of hook-forming

<CLAIMS>
A surface fastener molded of synthetic resin,
comprising: a plate-like substrate (1); and a multiplicity

of hooks (2) formed on one surface of said substrate (1)
integrally, each of said hooks (2) being composed of a

rising portion (21) having a front surface (24) rising from
said substrate (1), a rear surface (23) rising obliquely

from said substrate (1) along a smooth curved line and a
reinforcing rib (2a) located on at least one side surface,

and a hook-shape engaging portion (22) extending forwardly
from a distal end of said rising portion (21); characterized in that said plate-like

substrate (1) has been biaxially stretched after being
molded.
A molded surface fastener according to claim 1,
wherein said multiplicity of hooks (2) are arranged on said

one surface of said plate-like substrate (1) in rows and
columns in such a manner that said hooks (2) of either each

row or column are staggered from those of adjacent rows or
columns by 1/2 pitch, said plate-like substrate (1)having been

biaxially stretched after being molded.
