<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a deviation measuring antenna for monopulse radar. It includes at least two radiating panels (1, 2). Their beams (F1, F2) having the same phase centre, they are differently oriented, a monotonic function of the angular deviation of a signal received by the antenna being constructed from the ratio of the power of the signal received by the first panel (1) to its power received by the second panel (2). An even function of the signal received is obtained by summing these two signals. Application: accurate measurements of angular deviations.

<CLAIMS>
Deviation measurement antenna for monopulse
radar comprising at least two radiating panels (1,2), a

signal received by the antenna being seen by the latter
at a given angle (), the beams (F1, F2) from the

panels having the same phase centre in terms of bearing
and being oriented differently, means effecting a

monotonic function of the given angle () on the basis
of the ratio of the power (P1) of the signal received

by the first panel to its power (P2) received by the
second panel (2), characterized in that the power being

distributed in the panels (1,2) by distribution means
(3,4), a first axis (x) being merged with the sides of

the panels (1,2) facing the distribution means (3,4), a
second axis (y) being situated between the panels (1,2)

and equidistant from them, the power increases from a
point (x
0
) of the first axis (x) situated on the side of
the first panel (1) away from the second panel (2) up

to the second side of the first panel (1) facing the
second panel (2), the power being distributed in the

second panel in such a way that it is symmetric over
the assembly of the two panels (1, 2), with respect to

the second axis (y), in such a way as to obtain an even
function of the angle () by summing the signals

received in the beams (F1, F2).
Antenna according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the monotonic function is the logarithm of the

ratio of the powers (P1, P2). 
Antenna according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the panels (1,2) are

mutually offset by a given angle (1, 2) by rotation
about an axis (h) included within them.
Antenna according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the panels (1) are constituted by slotted guides.
Antenna according to either one of Claims 1 or
2, characterized in that the angular offset of the

beams (F1, F2) is obtained electronically.
Antenna according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, the panels (1, 2) being

constituted by slotted guides, the spacing between the
slots differs from one panel (1) to the other (2).
