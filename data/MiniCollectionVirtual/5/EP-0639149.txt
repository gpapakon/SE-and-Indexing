<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for dispensing product from a container (16) in which first and second members (36, 40) are provided in a vessel (32) which is disposed in the container (16). The first member (36) defines with the vessel a first chamber (38), and the second member (40) defines with the first member (36) a second chamber (46). When the first member moves to a second position in response to the pressure in the container decreasing below the predetermined pressure the first chamber is connected with the container to permit the pressurized gas in the first chamber to pass to the container. When the first member moves to a first position this connection is disconnected to prevent the passage of the gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure
generator and, more particularly to a dispensing
apparatus utilizing such a pressure generator for
dispensing product from sealed containers.Aerosol pressurized dispensers have become
familiar, if not essential, products in both consumer
and industrial use due to the efficient way in which
they discharge a myriad of products.A common example is the hair spray dispenser in
which, inside the dispenser, the product spray is
dispersed in and surrounded by a liquefied propellant
gas under pressure forming a uniform, single phase
measure of the product spray and the liquefied
propellant. As the product release valve is pressed,
the liquefied propellant immediately vaporizes forcing
the product spray out of the dispenser in the form of a
fine mist.A second type of aerosol dispenser, the cheese
spread dispenser being a common example, discharges the
product, not as a fine mist, but as a solid. In this
second category of aerosol dispensers, the propellant
exists within the dispenser as a gas and does not mix
with the product. Rather, it forms a separate layer
over the product to be discharged. As the product
release valve is pressed, the propellant, being under
pressure, pushes the product out of the dispenser. The most commonly used propellants are butane,
nitrogen and chlorinated fluorohydrocarbons (CFC's),
such as those sold under trade name of Freon. CFC's
and butane are often preferred over nitrogen since
their vapor pressures are independent of the volume of
free headspace in the dispenser. Thus, as long as some
of the CFC or butane is present in the dispenser, the
pressure exerted on the product is virtually constant
throughout the discharge life of the system.However, both CFC's and butane have adverse
effects on the environment. CFC's add to the
destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer which
has lead the world community to seek a complete ban of
CFC usage. Many countries have already banned its use
or have implemented programs and schedules designed to
eliminate CFC usage in the near future. Butane, on the
other hand, is extremely flammable, making storage,
handling and use of butane charged containers very
hazardous. In addition, butane contaminates the flavor
and smell of the dispensed product, thereby further
restricting its use.Although nitrogen is available as a substitute
propellant, its vapor pressure is such that as product
is dispensed, the propellant pressure decreases.
Therefore, the product cannot be dispensed at a
constant pressure

Apparatus for maintaining a substantially constant
predetermined pressure in a pressurized container (92)

for dispensing product contained in the container at
the substantially constant pressure, the apparatus

comprising:

a container (92),
a vessel (108) containing pressurized gas and disposed
in the container (92), and
means responsive to a reduction of gas pressure in the
container (92) for permitting the pressurized gas in

the vessel (108) to pass from the vessel to the
container to maintain the substantially constant

predetermined pressure in the container, such means
comprising:
a cylinder member (118) disposed in the vessel (108)
and defining with the vessel a first chamber (120) for

containing the pressurized gas,
a piston member (122) disposed in the cylinder member
(118) and defining with the cylinder member a second

chamber (124), one of the piston and cylinder members
being exposed to the pressure in the container (92) for

moving to a first position relative to the other member 
in which position the pressure in the container equals

the predetermined pressure,
means (48) including a pressurized gas in the second
chamber (124) for moving the one member to a second

position relative to the other member in response to
the pressure in the container (92) decreasing below the

predetermined pressure, and
connecting means (36a, 36b, 42) responsive to the one
member moving to the second position for connecting the

first chamber (120) with the container (92) to permit
the pressurized gas to pass from the first chamber

(120) to the container, the connecting means being
responsive to the one member moving to the first

position for disconnecting the first chamber (120) from
the container to prevent the passage of the pressurized

gas, thereby to maintain the substantially constant
predetermined pressure in the container,

wherein the vessel (108) is disposed in the container
(92) so as to divide the container into a third chamber

(113) for containing the product and a fourth chamber
(114) for containing gas at a predetermined pressure,

the vessel (108) being movable in the container in
response to a reduction of pressure in the third

chamber (113) as the product is dispensed such that the
volume of the third chamber reduces and the volume of

the fourth chamber (114) increases, such movement 
reducing the pressure of the gas in the fourth chamber

(114), and

wherein the connecting means (36a, 36b, 42) permits the
pressurized gas in the vessel (108) to pass from the

vessel only to the fourth chamber (114) to maintain the
predetermined pressure in the fourth chamber,

characterised in that:
neck means (108a) are provided extending from an end of
the cylinder member (118) such neck means permitting

the piston member to initially project from the
cylinder member so that the second chamber (124) can be

charged with the pressurized gas, the neck means (108a)
being adapted to thereafter partially block such end

of the cylinder member (118) to retain the piston
member (122) axially within the cylinder member.
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the cylinder
member (118) is secured relative to the vessel (108)

and the piston member (122) is exposed to the pressure
in the fourth chamber (114) and moves relative to the

cylinder member to the first and second positions.
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein one end of the
piston member (122) is exposed to the pressure in the

fourth chamber (114) and wherein the second chamber 
(124) is defined between the cylinder member (118) and

the other end of the piston member.
The apparatus of claim 3 wherein the moving means
comprises a spring (48) and/or pressurized gas disposed

in the second chamber (124) and acting on said other end
of the piston member (122).
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein the

outer diameter of the piston member (122) is slightly
less than the inner diameter of the cylinder member

(118) to permit the flow of the pressurized gas
therebetween, and wherein the connecting means

comprises an aperture (36a) in the wall of the cylinder
member (118), a sealing member (42) extending between

an outer surface of the piston member (122) and a
corresponding inner surface of the cylinder member

(118) for preventing the flow of pressurized gas when
the piston member is in the first position, and a notch

(36b) formed in one of the surfaces for receiving the
sealing member for permitting the flow of pressurized

gas when the piston member is in the second position.
The apparatus of claim 5 wherein the sealing
member extends in a groove formed in the piston member

(122) and engages the inner surface of the cylinder
member (118) and wherein the notch (36b) is formed in the

inner surface of the cylinder member.
