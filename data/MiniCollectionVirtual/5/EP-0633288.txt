<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a substantially uniformly blended, flame 
retardant polypropylene composition and an extruded polypropylene 

sheet which comprises a polypropylene polymer, the bis(2,3 
dibromopropylether) of tetrabromobisphenol A, antimony trioxide, 

titanium dioxide, calcium sulfate and distearyl pentaerythritol 
diphosphite. The invention further provides a method for 

producing such a polypropylene sheet material by forming a 
substantially uniform physical blend of the above components; 

drying the blend; heating the blend at a temperature above its 
melting point to form a melt of the blend components while mixing 

the melt; and extruding the blend through a sheet forming die and 
highly polished rollers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame retardant polymer 
compositions and more particularly to flame retardant 
polypropylene compositions. Such compositions are suitable for 
manufacturing extruded sheets useful for construction and 
building materials. Polypropylene resin is widely used in the production of etching 
tanks, electroplating tanks, hot air ducts, computer cabinets, 
electrical appliances, household interior decorations, and 
automobile parts among many other items. It is a polymer of 
choice due to its good processing characteristics, chemical 
resistance, weathering resistance, electrical properties and 
mechanical strength. One major disadvantage is that 
polypropylene is naturally flammable. This has generated a 
growing demand for flame retardant type of polypropylene and many 
such flame retardant polypropylene compositions have been 
suggested in the art. For example, it is known in the art to 
impart flame resistance to polypropylene compositions by the 
inclusion of certain fillers in a molten blend of the polymer. 
In this regard, U.S. patent 5,130,357 forms a blend of 
polypropylene, a synthetic rubber, silane coupling agent, 
ammonium polyphosphite, and a nitrogen containing organic 
compound. U.S. patent 3,892,815 and 4,005,156 uses 
poly(polyhalonorbornenylalkyl)benzene )benzene blended with polypropylene.  
 U.S. patent 5,124,404 mixes polypropylene with a copolymer of 
polypropylene and a brominated styrene monomer. U.S. patent 
5,216,059 discloses a flame retarding additive composition, 
useful in thermoplastic polyolefins comprising a mixture of a 
halogenated bisphenol derivative and the copolymer of a 
halogenated vinyl aromatic grafted onto polyolefin. The 
preferred bisphenol derivative is tetrabromobisphenol A 
bis(dibromopropyl ether), and the preferred graft copolymer 
comprises bromostyrene grafted onto isotactic or syndiotactic 
polypropylene. U.S. patent 3,687,890 teaches a thermoplastic 
composition which may include polypropylene, calcium sulfite, 
calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate. Calcium sulfate fillers 
are also taught in U.S. patents 3,198,596; 3,033,731; 
3,953,565; 3,976,612; and 3,981,840, among many others. 
Antimony trioxide as a flame retardant is taught in U.S. patent 
4,962,148. U.S. patent 4,038,237 teaches a composition of an 
alpha olefin, antimony trioxide and calcium sulfate in the 
presence of an extending oil, chlorinated hydrocarbon and a block 
copolymer of an elastomer and a non-elastomer. U.S. patent 
3,803,067 imparts fire
