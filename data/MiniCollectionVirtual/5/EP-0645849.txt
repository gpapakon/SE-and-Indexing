<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (2) comprising rows of 
terminals (6) therein has capacitance filter elements 

(36,38) bonded to side walls (14,16) thereof. The filter 
elements are comprised of a thin dielectric film laminated 

on either side with conductive material, the one side 
serving as a ground electrode and the other side divided 

into a plurality of signal electrodes separated by gaps 
formed by conventional etching process. The filter 

elements also have connection tabs (48,49) extending from 
a lower end (50) thereof, each tab connected to a separate 

electrode (42,44) and electrically connected to 
corresponding terminals (16) of the connector (2). The 

invention therefore provides for a readily manufacturable 
and cost effective filtered connector for filtering 

unwanted frequency components of a signal to be carried, 
the filter being mountable to the connector housing in an 

unobtrusive and compact manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector for
carrying signals according to the pre-characterizing part
of claim 1.The increasing use of high speed digital pulses for
communication has lead to the use of sensitive components
to receive and manipulate such signals. This sensitivity
has in turn made the components vulnerable to unwanted
frequencies transmitted thereto on the same signal path as
the wanted signal frequencies. To solve the problem
caused thereby, a number of developments have lead to
patents that purport to filter out unwanted frequencies
using electrical connector as the vehicle for
accommodating appropriate filters. US-A-4,695,115
relates to a telephone
connector with by-pass capacitor and teaches the use of
capacitors built into the connector to filter out unwanted
frequencies from the signals carried thereby. Means are
provided for interconnecting such capacitors between the
signal paths and grounding paths. As will be discerned,
the filters occupy a considerable proportion of the total
volume of the connector.US-A-4,772,224
represents a modular electrical connector which includes
capacitors and additionally, ferrite inductors to provide
filtering. As with patent no. 4,695,115, the filter
elements take up considerable volume, raising the height
of the device above a printed circuit board or part of the
assembly served by the filtered connector.US-A-5,145,413 discloses a connector including means to suppress
noise. The connector comprises a shielded housing, a plurality of
through contacts and a capacitor structure. The capacitor structure is
comprised of a block of insulating material carrying a plurality of
electrodes on the two surfaces of said block which are opposed to each
other. The capacitor structure is disposed in the middle region of that
through contact. The ground electrode is in the form of a strip on the
side of the insulating block opposed to the side which carries the signal
electrode pads.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a connector having filter means that add minimally
to the dimensions of the connector.This is achieved by the features defined in claim 1. Preferred embodiments are defined by the dependent claims.In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides  
a connector with filter means that are disposed on the
exterior surface of the connector housing in an
unobtrusive way.The invention also provides
a simple and readily manufacturable filter construction
that is cost effective yet reliable.According to a preferred
