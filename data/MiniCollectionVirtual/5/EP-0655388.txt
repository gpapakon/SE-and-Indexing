<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for introducing roots into a rectangular case. This process is characterised in that:   - a row (5) of roots (2) is formed periodically on a support (6) and the support (6) is brought slightly above the level where the row is to be placed, - a pusher (9) is brought to the rear of the row (5) and, by means of a relative displacement of at least two of the elements forming the case, the pusher and at least a part of the support, the row of roots is held in the case, and - before depositing a further row (5) of roots in the case again, a plate (10) is placed above the recently deposited row and all the rows present in the case are pushed down, then   - the cycle is restarted until the case is full.

A method of placing roots in a parallelepipedic case 
intended to accommodate a plurality of roots (2), 

particularly endives, arranged in rows and which, when they 
are thus placed, have their longitudinal axis substantially 

perpendicular to the bottom (3) of the case, according to 
which method of placing roots in the case the case is 

arranged such that its bottom (3) is at least substantially 
vertical and then, starting from its lowest horizontal side 

wall (4) forming a temporary base (4), a succession of rows 
(5) of roots is constituted, each row occupying the entire 

length of the so-called temporary base (4), and all of the 
rows forming the complete filling of the case, the method 

being characterised in that: 

a row (5) of roots (2) which, when placed side by side, 
are aligned at the level of their necks (7), is 

periodically constituted on a support (6) made in at 
least one part, which is substantially parallel to the 

base (4) of the case and the length of which is 
equivalent to the length of the base, 
the support (6) is brought to slightly above the level 
at which the row is to be placed and at least one 

portion of the support (6) is displaced to the bottom 
(3) of the case (1), 
a pusher (9) is brought to the back of the row (5) of 
roots placed on the support (6), i.e. on the side of 

the bunch of leaves, 
the row of roots is held and set down in the case by a 
relative movement of at least two of the elements 

consisting of the case, the pusher and at least a 
portion of the support, and  

 
before a new row (5) of roots is set down in the case, 
a so-called supporting plate (10) is placed above the 

newly set-down row and all of the rows present in the 
case are packed down by a movement of this plate (10) 

and the temporary base (4) of the case relative to one 
another, then 
the cycle is repeated until the case is full. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that, at 
least during the packing down with the supporting plate, all 

of the rows already placed are pressed against the bottom of 
the case with the aid of a screen (30). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that: 

a support (6) is provided consisting of at least two 
discrete elements, namely a grid for arranging roots 

and a supporting plate such as the one (10) with which 
the rows are packed down, and 
only the supporting plate is displaced towards the 
bottom of the case and the pusher is used to slide the 

roots off the grid in order to set them down on the 
edge of the plate, which will then be withdrawn so that 

it can finally be moved above the new rows. 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
supporting plate is moved only in a displacement movement 

(M) substantially perpendicular to the bottom (3) of the 
case and the so-called temporary base (4) is moved relative 

to the supporting plate in order to adjust the relative 
height positions of the support and the base and in order to 

pack down the roots,  
 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that: 


it is ensured that the supporting plate (10) is in 
position, 
the grid is brought above the supporting plate, 
the row of roots supported on the grid is slid onto the 
upper surface (11) of the supporting plate until the 

terminal ends of the roots are supported on the bottom 
of the case, then 
whilst holding the terminal ends of the roots supported 
on the bottom: 


the supporting plate is moved, 
the case is moved downwards by a distance 
sufficient to reintroduce the supporting plate 

above the newly set-down row, and 
when the plate has been positioned, the case is 
moved upwards in order to pack down its content. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that a row 
of roots aligned by their necks on the grid is constituted 

before the roots are trimmed. 
Means for performing the method of placing roots (2) in a 
parallelepipedic case (1), the roots being arranged in rows 

in the case (1), which comprises a bottom (3) and side walls 
(4), according to claim 1, the means comprising: 


a support (6) made in at least one part, 
means (12) for displacing at least a portion of the 
support to the bottom of the case such that the lower 

surface (8) of the support is located slightly above 
the first row available in the case, starting from the 

bottom, 
a pusher (9),  
 
means (13, 14) for effecting relative movements between 
at least two of the elements consisting of the case, 

the pusher and at least a portion of the support, in 
order to slide the row of roots into the case, 
a supporting plate (10), the length of which is 
substantially equal to the length of the support (6), 

and means (13, 14) for moving the supporting plate and 
the temporary base of the case relative to one another, 

and 
control means synchronising the relative movements of 
the case, the supporting plate, the pusher and the 

support according to the method of claim 1. 
Means according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
support (6) is constituted by at least two discrete 

elements, namely: 

a grid comprising a cross-piece (6a) to which a 
plurality of parallel fingers (6b) is fixed, and 
the supporting plate. 
Means according to claim 7, characterised in that the pusher 
(9) comprises: 


a so-called stop surface (9a) oriented perpendicularly 
to the direction of movement of the pusher, 
a supporting means (9b) which, when the pusher pushes 
the row of roots, is pressed against the top of this 

row, 
a motor means and means for guiding the pusher 
Means according to claim 7, characterised in that the grid 

is linked to other grids so that each grid forms one of the 
sectors (15) of a circular plate (16), the circular plate in 

turn being notable in that the teeth constituting the grids  
 

are parallel to one another in each sector, rather than 
being oriented radially.
