<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a precision resistor. The resistor comprises a 
substrate having two connections which are electrically interconnected 
via
 a resistance 
path, said resistance path comprising a first path portion having a positive TCR and a 

second path portion having a negative TCR. The resistor is characterized in that the 
resistance material of both path portions is selected so that the resistance values and the 

absolute TCRs of both path portions are comparable and in that both path portions are 
trimmed so that the resistor has desired resistance and TCR values. Preferably, the 

resistance materials used for the path portions consist of an alloy of substantially the 
same composition on the basis of CuNi or NiCrAl. The invention makes it possible to 

very accurately and reproducibly mass-produce precision resistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a resistor which comprises a substrate having two
connections which are electrically interconnected via a resistance path, said resistance
path comprising a first path portion having a positive TCR and a second portion having
a negative TCR.Resistors of the type mentioned above are referred to as "precision
resistors". They must have an accurately adjustable and readily reproducible resistance
value. The TCR of such a precision resistor must also be accurately adjustable and
readily reproducible. The deviation of the resistance value is preferably below 0.1%,
and the deviation of the intended TCR is preferably below 1 ppm/°C. The TCR of a
resistor is to be understood to mean the relative change of the resistance as a function of
temperature. The TCR is generally given in ppm/°C. In general, the aim is to
manufacture precision resistors whose TCR is substantially zero.A resistor of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is known per
se. For example, in United States Patent Specification US 4,907,341, a description is
given of a compound resistor of this construction. In this case, the resistance paths of
the individual resistors are composed of a first path portion, which is referred to as
"adjustable portion" and a second path portion which is referred to as "resistance
portion". The adjustable portion consists of an electrically well-conducting material
having a relatively high, positive TCR. The resistance portion consists of a customary
resistance material having a relatively low, negative TCR. In a typical exemplary
embodiment of said Patent Specification, NiCr having a TCR in the range from -30 to 0
ppm/°C is used as the material for the resistance portion, while Ni having a TCR of
+5000 ppm/°C is used as the material for the adjustable portion. The difference in
resistance between both portions amounts to a factor of 1000.In the manufacture of the known type of resistors the resistance value and
the TCR are adjusted as follows. First, the resistance of the individual resistors is
brought to the desired value by etching away the first path portion of resistance
material. Subsequently, the TCR of the individual resistors is reduced to a value close 
to 0 ppm/°C by subjecting the second path portion of the conductive material to an
operation which is also referred to as "trimming".The manufacture of the known resistor has several disadvantages. For
example, it has been found in practice that the TCR of untrimmed resistors can vary
quite substantially as a result of small
