<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing hosiery items, termed "top-to-top" 
method, and the related modified knitting and 

stitching machines. The method includes the following steps: 
knitting a first hosiery item (1) starting from a top (2) 

down to a toe (7); knitting at least one row of trim (8) at 
the end of the toe (7); knitting a second hosiery item (10) 

at the end of the row of trim (8) starting from a second toe 
(17) up to a second top (12); separating and stitching the 

first and second hosiery items (1, 10) initially joined by 
the trim row (8) by means of a specifically modified 

stitching machine. The stitching machine includes two 
independent stitching units (36, 37) which are fed by a 

common conveyor (31) which is provided with a cutter and 
with diverging traction means. Top-to-top knitting can be 

performed with appropriately modified mechanically-programmed 
machines or with electronically programmed 

machines. The advantage of the method is that it 
considerably increases productivity and almost completely 

eliminates the waste of excess thread that occurs with 
current operations for stitching the toes of individually 

knitted hosiery items.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the textile field and
more specifically relates to toe stitching machines for
hosiery items such as socks, stockings, pop socks and the
like.Hosiery items such as socks, stockings, pop socks and
the like, hereinafter generically termed "hosiery", are
currently knitted mainly by means of high-speed circular
machines, for example similar to a machine disclosed in GB-A-1
078 462, starting from the top down to the toe or vice
versa.These machines have electronic or mechanical
programming that controls the relative movements of needles,
hooks, thread guides and other components and elements of
the machine in order to obtain different kinds of knitting
according to the different effects to be provided on the
item of hosiery.For example, a hosiery item such as a sock is currently
manufactured by knitting the following portions in
succession: double top, body, heel, foot, and toe. A few
rows of "trim", i.e. rows with very loose stitches, are
usually knitted after the toe, followed by a thicker
trimming and by a hemstitch. At this point the thread guides
are raised and the threads are cut.When knitting ends, the hosiery items still have a
tubular shape which is open at the level of the toe, and it
is necessary to stitch this toe; this stitching is currently
often performed with automatic stitching machines that
require an operator to load the hosiery items manually one 
by one. Chain means move the hosiery items towards heads for
cutting the waste constituted by the hemstitch, by the
trimming and by part of the trim rows, and stitch the open
toe so that the hosiery items have perfectly and uniformly
closed toes.Although some stitching machines for hosiery items,
such as for example those manufactured in Italy by the
companies Rosso, Conti Complett and Exacta, have achieved
very high working speeds, a limit to productivity is set by
the fact that each hosiery item is inserted manually and the
operator must be careful to stretch the end part of the toe
that includes the trimming, which is normally curled and
uneven at the end of the knitting. This trimming must in
fact lie on one side of an insertion guide, whereas the rest
of the hosiery item must be on the opposite side, and the
trim rows are made to slide in the guide until the traction
means grip them.Accordingly, the presence of the trimming after the
trim rows has the purpose of ensuring correction insertion
on the guide, although it entails a waste of thread which is
hardly negligible for large-scale productions such as

Stitching machine for stitching toes of
hosiery items knitted top-to-top, characterized in that it

comprises two independent stitching units (36, 37) which are
fed by a common conveyor (31) that has an inlet guide (32;

105) in which a row of trim interposed between mutually
joined first and second hosiery
 items engages, there being
means (33; 111) for cutting said row of trim and traction

means (34, 35; 107a, 107b) which are suitable to carry said
first and second hosiery items towards said cutting means

and subsequently, along separate paths, towards said two
independent stitching units.
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that
said means for cutting said trim row comprise a cutter with

a blade (43) which is actuated by an eccentric element (41)
that oscillates with respect to a fixed counter-blade which

is rigidly coupled to a supporting frame (45) of said
conveyor, said traction means comprising a first toothed

chain (40) which internally engages said conveyor and two
additional conveyors (34, 35) located downstream of said

cutter which are suitable to engage the toes of said hosiery
items and guide them along separate paths towards said

independent stitching units.
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that
said traction means comprise, downstream of said inlet guide

along the advancement direction (106) of said hosiery items
towards said stitching units, two pairs of chains (107a,

107b) wherein the chains of each pair comprise an upper
chain (108) and a lower chain (109) which face each other

with one of their portions at a horizontal table (110) for 
feeding two hosiery items joined by said row of trim, said

upper and lower chains being provided with first retention
means (112, 113) which engage one of said two hosiery items

proximate to said trim row to clamp it parallel to said feed
table, said two pairs of chains facing each other along said

advancement direction, said cutting means (111) being
arranged between said two pairs of chains.
Machine according to claim 3, characterized in that
said first retention means comprise serrations (112) which

are applied to the links of said chains and are arranged

Machine according to one or more of the preceding
claims 3-4, characterized in that said cutting means

comprise a cutter which is synchronized with the advancement
motion of said chains.
Machine according to one or more of the preceding
claims 3-5, characterized in that said feed table has,

of chains having a final portion that extends beyond the
related upper chain and is provided with second hosiery item

retention means (117, 118) which cooperate with second
hosiery item retention means (117, 118) which are mounted on
