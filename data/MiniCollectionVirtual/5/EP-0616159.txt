<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for keeping 
the wall of a first object (2) spaced apart from the wall of 

a spaced second object (1) which surrounds the first object (2). 
The device comprises a number of wires (13) consisting of a 

resilient material. At one end the said wires (13) are 
connected to a supporting member (7) and from the said 

supporting member (7) extend in the unloaded condition 
freely in a direction away from the supporting member (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for keeping 
the wall of a first object spaced apart from the wall of 
a spaced second object surrounding the first object. Known devices for keeping objects spaced apart 
usually consist of parts, for example, from metal, which 
are rigidly connected to the said objects. When such a 
known device is used, difficulties are encountered in 
that it is often difficult for the device to be matched 
to deviations in the spacing between the objects with 
respect to the spacing for which the device has been 
designed. Furthermore, difficulties may be encountered 
in that the device is not suitable for receiving 
relative movements, if any, between the objects, as a 
result of which undesired stresses may be formed in the 
device and/or the objects, which may lead to damage of 
the objects. It is the object of the invention to provide a 
device of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph, 
in which the above-mentioned disadvantages can be 
omitted.  According to the invention this can be achieved in 
that the device comprises a number of wires of a 
resilient material, and each wire is connected at one 
end to a supporting member and, in the unloaded 
condition, extends freely from the said supporting 
member in a direction away from the supporting member. When using the device according to the 
invention, one or more supporting parts may assume a 
fixed position with respect to one of the objects, while 
the free ends of the wires may contact the other object. 
The wires may be deflected slightly from their unloaded 
position, so that they bear with a certain force on the 
said other object and thus keep the two objects at a 
desired spacing with respect to each other. Variations, 
if any, in the spacing between the objects can easily be 
compensated for. The wires of a resilient material are 
also capable of receiving movements, if any, between the 
objects without undesired stresses occurring in the 
objects and/or the wires of a resilient material. The invention will now be described in greater 
detail with reference to a few possible embodiments of 
the device according to the invention shown in the 
accompanying drawings, in which  Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional 
view of a part of a flue gas duct in which a jacket has 
been placed which is kept spaced from the wall of the 
flue gas duct by means of devices according to the 
invention, Figure 2 is a perspective view of a supporting 
member having two bundles of wires connected therewith, Figure 3 is a
