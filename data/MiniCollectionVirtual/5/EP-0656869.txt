<ABSTRACT>
A barrier (10) for use in a pressurized container (22) comprising a unitary flexible and expandable member (11) having an outer wall segment (12) terminating in a sealing flange (16) and an inner wall segment (14) joined to the outer wall segment (12) through a fold (15) and a central piston region (20) emerging from the terminus of the inner wall segment (14) distal to the fold (15); the barrier (10) being sufficiently thick and rigid to be free-standing before incorporation into a pressurized container (22). The outer and (12) inner wall (14) segments are oppositely-directed frustoconical shapes forming a small acute angle with each other. The outer (12) and inner (14) wall segments expand outwardly to progressively conform to the container inner wall surface (23) as product is evacuated from the container (22). The outer wall segment (12) may be thicker and more rigid than the inner wall segment (14). The barrier is nestable with like barriers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pressurized dispenser packages, such as aerosol packages,
wherein the product to be dispensed and the pressure-generating media, i.e. the
propellant, are maintained in isolation through separation on opposite sides of a barrier.
An aerosol package of this type is generally referred to as a "barrier pack" aerosol
package. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for handling a
plurality of unitary flexible barriers for use in a plural-zoned, valved pressure
container.Aerosol barrier packs of the prior art have been of at least three general types. In the
piston-type barrier pack, the barrier is a piston-like component that is mounted in the
container in sliding relation to the inside surface of the container. The product to be
dispensed is disposed on the valved side of the piston and the propellant, which
generates pressure within the container, is on the opposite side of the piston. In Aerosol
Hanbook, Second Edition, 1982, there is described a piston-type aerosol dispenser
marketed by American Can Company under the trade-name "Mira-Flo". In the Mira-Flo
dispenser, the piston skirt is designed to seal against the sides of the container to
prevent the propellant gas from passing into the product chamber on the other side of
the piston. Actuation of the aerosol discharge valve causes a reduction in pressure in the
product chamber thereby resulting in the pressure in the propellant chamber urging the
piston toward the discharge valve and causing the discharge of product through the
discharge valve. Examples of a piston-type 
barrier pack are described in United States Patent Nos.
3,022,923, 3,756,476 and 3,929,132.In a second type of aerosol barrier pack, a flexible,
collapsible bag is affixed within the container opening either
to the aerosol discharge valve or to the bead of the container
opening. The Continental Can Company in the late 1960's
introduced an aerosol barrier dispenser known as the "Sepro-Can".
The Sepro-Can includes an interior plastic product bag
having an opening that is attached to the valve opening at the
top of the container. The side walls of the bag extend along
the side walls of the container and are pleated like an
accordion so the bag can collapse inward and upward under the
influence of pressure in the remainder of the container as the
bag is emptied. Patents which illustrate a barrier pack of
the second type are set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,788,521,
3,896,970 and 4,067,499. Modifications of barrier packs of
the second type
