<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus for recording an image in response
to image information on a recording material supplied
from a plurality of sheet supply means.In the past, in image forming apparatuses such
as copying machines, as sheet supply means, there have
been used a manual insertion sheet supply means in
which recording materials (referred to as "sheets"
hereinafter) is manually inserted one by one into a
manual insertion opening to be supplied to an image
forming portion and an automatic sheet supply means
in which sheets stacked in a cassette or on a tray
are separated one by one and the separated sheet is
supplied to an image forming portion. Further, image
forming apparatuses having the combination of these
sheet supply means have also been usually used.Now, an example of a conventional copying machine
having the above-mentioned manual insertion sheet supply
means and automatic sheet supply means will be explained
with reference to Figs. 9 to 11. The copying machine
inherently includes the manual insertion sheet supply
means and the automatic sheet supply means is added 
to the machine as option.The copying machine includes manual insertion
guide members 91 through which a sheet P is supplied
by the manual insertion, which guide members can be
shifted relatively in directions shown by the double
headed arrow C to regulate the sheet P in its widthwise
direction by their inner guide surfaces 91a, as shown
in Fig. 10. A first convey path 92 for guiding the
manually inserted sheet P in a direction shown by the
arrow A is defined between the manual insertion guides
91. Further, in Fig. 9, there is also provided a second
sheet convey path 95 for guiding a sheet P supplied
by a sheet convey roller 94 from a cassette 93 mounted
within a lower portion of the apparatus in a direction
shown by the arrow B.At a junction between the first and second
convey paths 92, 95, a junction guide 96 is integrally
formed with a body of the apparatus. The junction
guide 96 forms a part of an outer wall of the body
of the apparatus. The sheet P conveyed through the
first or second convey path 92 or 95 is sent toward
the interior of the apparatus by means of a pair of
convey rollers 97.In this way, generally, in the image forming
apparatus having both the manual insertion sheet supply
means and the automatic sheet supply means, the first
convey path 92 for exclusively guiding the sheet supplied 
by the manual insertion sheet supply means and the
second convey path 95 defined by the junction

<CLAIMS>
A sheet supply apparatus for supplying a sheet to an image
forming means, comprising guide means (5, 27) consisting of two

guide members (5, 5') arranged relatively movable in a
direction perpendicular to the sheet insertion direction in

accordance with the sheet width,
characterized in that
 each guide member (5, 5') has a first
guide surface (5a) for guiding a sheet inserted manually and a

second guide surface (5b) for guiding a sheet inserted
automatically.
A sheet supply apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
guide member (5, 5') has said first guide surface (5a) at an

upper side thereof and has said second guide surface (5b) at a
lower side thereof.
A sheet supply apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
guide member (5, 5') has a width regulating portion (5c) for

regulating side edges of the sheet to be supported.
