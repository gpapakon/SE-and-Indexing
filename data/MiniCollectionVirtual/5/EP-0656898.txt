<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a series of pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-ones, 
which are potent and selective 
inhibitors of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate 
phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE), having utility in a 
variety of therapeutic areas including the treatment of 
cardiovascular disorders such as angina, hypertension, 
heart failure and atherosclerosis. The compounds of the invention exhibit selectivity 
for inhibition of cGMP PDEs rather than cyclic 
adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterases (cAMP 
PDEs) and, as a consequence of this selective PDE 
inhibition, cGMP levels are elevated, which in turn can 
give rise to beneficial anti-platelet, anti-neutrophil, 
anti-vasospastic and vasodilatory activity, as well as 
potentiation of the effects of endothelium-derived 
relaxing factor (EDRF) and nitrovasodilators. Thus the 
compounds have utility in the treatment of a number of 
disorders, including stable, unstable and variant 
(Prinzmental) angina, hypertension, pulmonary 
hypertension, congestive heart failure, 
atherosclerosis, conditions of reduced blood vessel 
patency e.g. post-percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasty (post-PTCA), peripheral vascular disease, 
stroke, bronchitis, allergic asthma, chronic asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, glaucoma, and diseases characterised 
by disorders of gut motility, e.g. irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS). European patent application EP-A-0347146 discloses 
certain pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-ones which, unlike the 
compounds of the present invention, contain a 
monosubstituted phenyl moiety at the 2-position of the 
said heterobicyclic system. These compounds are 
reported to be selective cGMP PDE inhibitors with 
bronchodilator and vasodilator activity of value in  
 
combatting asthma, bronchitis, angina, hypertension and 
congestive heart failure. The compounds of the present 
invention contain a 2,5-disubstituted phenyl moiety at 
the 2-position of the pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one 
bicyclic system and are significantly more potent cGMP 
PDE inhibitors than the previously mentioned prior art 
compounds. The compounds of the present invention have the 
formula (I): 
 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,
 
wherein 
R' is H, C1-C4 alkyl, CN or CONR4R5; R2 is C2-C4 alkyl; R3 is SO2NR6R7, NO2, NH2, NHCOR8, NHSO2R8 or 
N(SO2R8)2; R4 and R5 are each independently selected from 
H and c1-C4 alkyl; R6 and R7 are each independently selected from 
H and C1-C4 alkyl optionally substituted with 
CO2R9, OH, pyridyl, 5-isoxazolin-3-onyl,
