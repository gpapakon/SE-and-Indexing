Process for fabricating a semiconductor device, comprising at least one chip (2) having, on a substantially planar accessible face, electrical connection areas (5), the process comprising the following steps:

• metal wires (6) are connected by bonding to areas (5) of the chip (2) in a direction substantially perpendicular to said substantially planar face of the chip;
• a coating of electrically insulating material (3) is deposited on said face with a thickness corresponding to the electrical isolation of the chip (2), the electrically insulating material being a heat-stable material, with properties similar to those of polyimides, with a thickness of greater than 0.05 mm; and
• a surface metallization operation is carried out on said coating (3) in a pattern defining metallized pads (4, 14, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43) electrically connected to the metal wires (6).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said electrically insulating heat-stable material is among polyimides, polyphenylquinoxalines, polysiloxanes, epoxy resins or the like.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2, in which the chip (2) is produced on a substrate (1),
characterized in that
, after the step of coating with the electrically insulating material and before the metallization step, a V-shaped groove (S) is scored on the electrically insulating material (3) at the location of the paths for dicing the chips (2).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the coating with electrically insulating material (3) is carried out so as to define leads (20) at the place of the metal wires (6).
