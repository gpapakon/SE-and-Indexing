<ABSTRACT>
Recombinant pathogen-resistant plants comprise transformed plant cells, with the transformed plant cells containing a heterologous DNA construct comprising an expression cassette. The construct comprises a promoter, a structural gene positioned downstream from the promoter, and a termination sequence such as the nos terminator positioned downstream from the stuctural gene. The promoter is one which is activated by a plant pathogen which attacks the plant, such as the RB7 nematode-responsive element. The structural gene encodes a product such a Barnase which is toxic to the plant cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of
controlling
plant-parasitic
nematodes.World-wide, plant-parasitic nematodes are
among the most devastating pathogens of life sustaining
crops. In 1984, nematodes accounted for more than $100
billion in economic losses. The United States' portion
of this figure is almost $6 billion. While such monetary
figures are staggering, much of this crop destruction
occurs in tropical and subtropical regions where
agricultural production is often a matter of life and
death.Genetic resistance to certain nematode species
is available in some cultivars, but these are restricted 
in number and the availability of cultivars with both
desirable agronomic features and resistance is limited.
In addition, traditional methods for plant breeding
require 5-10 years to produce a viable cultivar, while
the need for new nematode control tools is immediate and
critical.The major means of nematode control has been
the application of chemical nematicides. During 1982, in
the United States alone over 100 million pounds of
nematicide were applied to crops. Chemical nematicides
are generally highly toxic compounds known to cause
substantial environmental impact. In the past several
years, issues such as ground water contamination,
mammalian and avian toxicity, and residues in food have
caused much tighter restrictions on the use of chemical
nematicides. Unfortunately, in many situations there is
no alternative available for growers who rely upon
nematicides to protect their crop from root-knot and cyst
nematodes.Recently, it has become possible to
genetically engineer crop plants resistant to particular
pests. Perhaps the first example of this approach is
that of viral coat protein genes introduced into tobacco.
Tobacco plants genetically engineered to carry and
express the Tobacco Mosaic Virus coat protein gene were
shown to resist systemic infection by the intact virus.
Another strategy is to utilize gene sequences that will
kill or inhibit the pathogen directly. This approach has
been used to produce transgenic plants that express the
insect toxin gene from the bacterium Bacillus
thuringiensis which, when ingested, causes insect gut
paralysis. Although this strategy has resulted in crop
cultivars resistant to certain pests, there are several
disadvantages to the approach. Primarily, the
constitutive expression of any "toxin" gene places upon
the pest population very strong selective pressure for
resistance. Another disadvantage of this approach is the 
negative energy balance the host plant
