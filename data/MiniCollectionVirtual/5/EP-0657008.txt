<ABSTRACT>
A support designed as a portable stand has a round, smaller head (6) linked by a height-adjustable central stay (5) to a round, larger foot (1). In its vertical position, the support is useful for carrying one or several portable fluorescent hand lamps (14, 14') on its outer ring (7) linked by two radial braces (8-8''') to the central, flat part of the stand head. One or two portable fluorescent hand lamps (14, 14') may be longitudinally inserted with their handle into a holding part (9) securable to the stand head, perpendicularly to the central stay (5). The specific weight of the stand head (6) itself having a smaller diameter causes the centre of gravity to be displaced toward the centre of the axis and thus prevents the support from toppling over together with the fluorescent lamps (14) suspended from or inserted into the holding part (9). The outer ring (4) of the stand foot (1) has downwardly open radial openings (22) that extend over part of its height and allow cables to be safely laid and a high stability to be achieved. The central part of the stand foot (1) is saucer-shaped. Four fastening means (11-11''', 12-12''') are arranged both at the outer edge of the stand head (6) and at the outer edge of the stand foot (1). A bifurcated end (13, 13') of a holding strap (10) may be attached to each of these fastening means, allowing the support to be suspended from a plurality of fastening devices, including overhead points.
