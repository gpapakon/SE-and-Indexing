<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a straightening machine for wire with a casing (1) that is driven in rotation about its longitudinal axis, with a plurality of straightening dies (2) which are offset radially relative to the longitudinal axis (3), and with an adjusting device for a radial adjustment of the straightening dies (2). The straightening dies (2) are rotatably mounted in straightening-die holders (8) which are arranged in a manner axially fixed in the casing (1) and radially movable relative to the longitudinal axis of the casing. According to the invention, the adjusting device has two push-action elements (9) which are arranged so as to be axially movable and displaceable in pairs in the casing (1). On associated sections, the push-action elements (9) have wedge faces (10, 11) which are aligned parallel to one another and form pairs of wedge faces. The straightening-die holders (8) are supported slidably between the wedge faces (10, 11) of the pairs of wedge faces and when the push-action elements (9) are actuated, they execute a radial movement in accordance with the wedge-face angle of the associated pair of wedge faces.

A straightening machine for wire, particularly for concrete-reinforcing wire, having 

a housing (1) which is driven in rotation about its longitudinal axis (3), 
straightening dies (2) which are rotatably mounted in straightening die holders (8) 
which are radially adjustable in relation to the longitudinal axis (3), and 
an adjusting device having two thrust elements (9) which are displaceable in pairs and 
which comprise wedge faces (10, 11) which are aligned parallel to each other on 

radially associated sections, 
 
wherein a straightening die holder (8) which is disposed axially fixed in the housing (1) is 

supported on the wedge faces (10, 11) which are associated in pairs so that it can move by 
sliding, the straightening die (2) of which straightening die holder is disposed free from offset 

on the longitudinal axis (3) of the housing (1) in a first operating position (I) of the thrust 
elements (9), and the straightening die (2) of which is at a predetermined radial offset in 

relation to the longitudinal axis (3) in a second operating position (II) of the thrust elements 
(9), characterised in that the two thrust elements which are axially movably disposed in the 

housing (1) have a multiplicity of wedge faces (10, 11) which are associated in pairs, the 
wedge face angles of which differ as regards their magnitude and/or algebraic sign, and that 

all the radially movable straightening die holders (8) are supported on the wedge faces (10, 
11) of the two thrust elements (9),
 
   wherein in the first operating position (I) of the two thrust elements (9) all the 

straightening dies (2) are disposed free from offset on the longitudinal axis (3) of the 
housing (1),
  
 

   wherein the radial adjustment of the straightening die holders (8) can be initiated in 
a forcibly coupled manner by the axial adjustment of the thrust elements (9),
 
   wherein in the second operating position (II) of the two thrust elements (9) all the 

straightening dies (2) have a predetermined die-specific maximum eccentricity in 
relation to the longitudinal axis (3), and
 
   wherein according to the wire thickness of the wire to be straightened the thrust 

elements (9) can be moved into further operating positions (III) between the first and 
the second operating positions (I, II). 
A straightening machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the thrust elements 
(9) can be locked in the operating positions (I, II, III). 
A straightening machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the thrust 
elements (9) are guided in rails (13) which are inserted between housing half shells (14) and 

are screwed to the latter to form the housing (1).
