<ABSTRACT>
Techniques are disclosed for depleting raster data (W) 
to allow printing of the depleted raster data on a grid 

that corresponds to the resolution of the undepleted raster 
data with a printed dot size (40) that is larger that would 

otherwise be utilized with the undepleted raster data and 
to achieve faster ink dry time. Also disclosed is a 

technique for up scaling raster data (b₁, b₂, b₃, b₄) at a 
particular resolution (e.g., 300 dpi) to a higher resolution 

in such a manner that expanded data includes a greater 
number of dot producing pixels to compensate for a dot size 

that is larger than the dot size that is appropriate for 
the higher resolution, and does not require horizontal 

depletion for printing with such dot size. This allows 
raster data at a particular resolution to be combined with 

higher resolution rasterized vector data for printing in 
accordance with the enhanced mode of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is generally directed to swath
type printers, and more particularly to apparatus and
techniques for reducing pixel density to allow for higher
resolution printing with print elements designed for lower
resolution printing.A swath printer is a raster or matrix type printer
that is capable of printing a plurality of rows of dots in
a single scan of a movable print carriage across the print
media. The possible locations for dots that can be printed
by a raster printer can be represented by an array or grid
of pixels or square areas arranged in a rectilinear array
of rows and columns wherein the center to center distance
or dot pitch between pixels is determined by the resolution
of the printer. For example, if a printer is capable of
printing 300 dots per inch (dpi), the dot pitch of the
pixel array would be 1/300th of an inch. The print carriage of a swath printer typically
includes a plurality of printing elements (e.g., ink jet
nozzles) displaced relative to each other in the media
motion direction which allows printing of a plurality of
rows of dots. The separation between the printing elements
in the media scan direction corresponds to the dot pitch
for the finest raster row resolution that can be printed by
the printer in a single carriage scan (e.g., 1/300th of an
inch for 300 dot per inch (dpi) resolution). The printing
elements of a swath printer are commonly implemented in a
printhead such as a thermal ink jet printhead that is
integral to a replaceable thermal ink jet printhead cartridge.The quality of the printed images produced by a raster
printer depends to large degree on the resolution of the
printer. Higher or finer resolution wherein the printed
dots are more closely spaced provides for higher quality
images.A consideration with increasing the resolution of ink
jet printers is that increased resolution requires more
printed dots per unit area, with the number of dots increasing
by the product of the increase factor along each
dimension. For example, doubling print resolution from 300
dpi to 600 dpi results in four times as many dots per unit
area. Since the number of dots per unit area increases
with resolution, the size of each printed dot must decrease
with increased resolution in order to avoid saturating the
print media. For example, if a 300 dpi ink jet cartridge
were utilized to print at 600 dpi, the amount of ink per
unit area would increase by a factor of four, just as the
number of dots increased. However, the design and implementation
of higher resolution

<CLAIMS>
A method for depleting a row of the pixel data array, in a swath type printer having a movable carriage for supporting a plurality of print elements which
are controlled to print dots on a rectilinear array of pixels each having an associated pixel data bit in a

bit-mapped pixel data array which is logically organized in rows and columns to correspond to the
printed pixel array, the rows being organized in a sequence that starts with a starting row and ends

with an ending row, each row of the pixel data array being organized into non-overlapping
immediately adjacent K-bit words, the method comprising

the steps of:

(A) providing a depletion mask (M) for each word (W(R, CW)) having at least a predetermined number (THRESHOLD) of 1's,
wherein the depletion mask is set to


(1) the adjacent word (PRIOR (CW)) in the immediately prior row if the row being depleted is the end
row (step 675);
(2) the result of bitwise binary ANDing of an adjacent word in the immediately prior row
with an adjacent word in the immediately next row (W (R+1, CW)) if the row being depleted is not the end

row (step 667);
(B) for each word that contains at least the predetermined minimum number of 1's, replacing the
word with a result of bitwise binary ANDing the word with the binary 1's complement (M') of the

depletion mask associated with the word so as to replace the word with a depleted word (step 671);
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the depletion mask, provided in step (A) comprises the
further option of setting the depletion mask to


(3) the adjacent word in the immediately next row if the binary 1's complement of the
result of binary bitwise exclusive-ORing (step 665) the word with an adjacent word in a prior in

sequence row is 1 (step 667).
A method as claimed in claim 2, further comprising the step of:

(C) for each word that contains at least the predetermined minimum number of 1's, bitwise
binary ORing (step 669) the binary 1's complement of the depletion mask associated therewith with a bit

preserving mask to produce a modified depletion mask associated with the word.
A method as claimed in any claims from 1 to 3, further comprising the step of:

(D) horizontally depleting the row to provide a horizontally depleted row wherein bits at ends of a
horizontal run of bits that are 1's are preserved while interior bits of a horizontal run are separated

from each other by at least one bit that is 0, except as to a horizontal run that having an even
number of bits in which case a bit adjacent an end bit of the horizontal run remains 1 (Fig. 9).
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein different K-bit bit preserving masks are utilized for K-bit
words that are adjacent in a same column.
A method as claimed in claim 5, further comprising the step of:

performing steps (A) through (C) only for alternating rows of the pixel data array.
A method as claimed in any claims from 1 to 3, further comprising the step of horizontally depleting a
row of the pixel data array, wherein said step of horizontally depleting comprises the steps of:


(A) sequentially selecting the first through last in sequence K-bit word in the row;
(B) forming (step 359) an index of K+2 bits comprised of the selected K-bit word, a bit that is immediately
adjacent the selected K-bit word and contained in an immediately prior in sequence K-bit word,

and a second additional bit that is immediately adjacent the selected K-bit word and contained in
an immediately next in sequence K-bit word, except for the first in sequence word in a row for

which the first additional bit is a 0 and except for the last in sequence K-bit word for which second
additional bit is a 0;
(C) accessing (step 361) a depleter look-up table with the index for the selected K-bit word to obtain a
replacement K-bit word; and
(D) replacing (step 361) the selected K-bit word with the replacement K-bit word, whereby all K-bit words in
the pixel data array are replaced with K-bit words retrieved from the look-up table.
