<ABSTRACT>
A supporting frame (1), particularly for aligned 
wheels (3) of skates, which is shaped like a "U" on the 

wings (2a,2b) of which there is a plurality of first and 
second holes (4,5) having the same axis. These holes 

constitute seats for removable pivots (6) for the wheels 
and are respectively partially closed and temporarily 

closeable at their opposite ends. A sliding bar (9), 
slideable in a groove (8), is used for blocking, at least 

temporarily, the pivots (6). The wheels are associable with 
the supporting frame without requiring screws and thus 

containing the assembly and general costs of the skate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a supporting frame, 
particularly for aligned wheels of skates. Currently, known skates with aligned wheels have a 
frame which is essentially shaped like a "U", between the 
ground-facing wings of which there is a plurality of holes 
at which the stem of a screw for supporting the hub of a 
wheel is placed; locking occurs for example by using an 
adapted nut to tighten the screw. The solution which entails the use of screws, however, 
has some drawbacks: first of all a certain amount of time 
is required by the operator to insert the screw, associate 
the nut therewith and then tighten it; the operator must 
therefore have available a screwdriver as well as a wrench 
to lock the nut; during these steps, the screw may be badly 
tightened on the nut, consequently stripping it and 
requiring replacement. Furthermore, excessive or 
insufficient tightening of the screw can entail the 
uncoupling of the nut or the mutual approach of the wings 
of the frame: in the first case, the screw can be lost and 
the wheel thus detaches; in the second case, good rolling 
does not occur due to friction of the wings of the frame 
with the wheel. From US-1.348.767 it is known a threadless rod or bolt locked 
at one end by a clip. GB-125267 
which is used as basis for the preamble of independent claims 1 
and 2, 
teaches a supporting frame, particularly for aligned 
wheels of skates, having ground facing wings accommodating 
therebetween a plurality of wheels, said wheels being blocked 
by corresponding pivots that are engaged through coaxially 
arranged pairs of holes defined in said wings. A principal aim of the present invention is therefore 
to solve the drawbacks described above by providing a 
supporting frame for aligned wheels of skates which allows 
easy and rapid assembly of said wheels.  
 Another aim of the present invention is to provide a 
frame in which wheel assembly is always optimum and 
maintained in such conditions even during use of the skate. Another aim is to obtain a frame which allows the user 
to replace the wheels in a rapid, simple and anyway  
 
accurate manner in case of wear thereof. A further aim is to obtain a frame which does not 
require particular tools for the user or assembler. Another important aim is to provide a frame which is 
structurally simple and easy to industrialize and has very 
modest manufacturing costs allowing its universal diffusion 
and application even on known skate types. With these aims, and other aims which will become 
apparent

<CLAIMS>
Supporting frame, particularly for aligned wheels (3) 
of skates, having ground faced wings on which there is a 

plurality of first and second holes (104, 105), the first and 
second holes of each pair having the same axis and 

constituting seats to accommodate a plurality of pivots 
adapted to interact with the hub (7) of said wheels (3), 

characterized in that said first holes (104) have, on the 
outside of a first of said wings (102b), an annular seat 

(110), each one of said pivots (106) having at one end a 
protruding head (111) and at the opposite end an annular 

recess (112), said head (111) engaging said annular seat (110) 
and said annular recess (112) being engaged by a bar (109), a 

groove (108) being longitudinally defined on the outside of a 

second one of said ground faced wings, said second holes (105) 
being defined into said groove (108), said bar (109) being 

adapted to slide within said groove (108) and being 
complementary shaped with respect to said annular recess (112) 

of each pivot (106) to engage and block said pivots during its 
sliding movement. 
Supporting frame, particularly for aligned wheels (3) 
of skates, having ground faced wings on which there is a 

plurality of first and second holes (4, 5), the first and 
second holes of each pair having the same axis and 

constituting seats to accommodate a plurality of pivots 
adapted to interact with the hub (7) of said wheels (3), 

characterized in that said first holes (4) are partially 
closed in that they partially accommodate an end of said pivot 

which cannot exit therethrough due to a reduction in diameter 
of said holes, said second holes (5) being formed at an 

adapted groove (8) formed longitudinally on one (2a) of said 
wings (2a, 2b) opposite to the wing (2b) provided said first 

holes (4), the length of said pivots being such that one of 
their ends ia arranged within said first holes and within said 

second holes without protruding at said groove (8), a 
complementary shaped bar (9) being slideably associable within 

said groove, having a dovetail cross-section, said bar being 
inserted and subsequently locked within said groove so as to 

temporarily close said second holes, preventing the escape of 
said pivots.
