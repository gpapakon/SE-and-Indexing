<ABSTRACT>
The process by means of which hydrogen chloride, HCl, is produced from chlorine-containing waste, comprises the following steps     a) incineration of the waste, b) production of crude acid from the flue gas formed during incineration by means of gas scrubbing, c) treatment of wastewater (effluent) which is sometimes formed in the flue gas scrub, residual waste having a high proportion of solids and also a chloride-containing solution being produced, d) recirculation of the chloride-containing solution to incineration for the purpose of chlorine recovery, e) azeotropic distillation of the crude acid to give an HCl-rich gas with simultaneous removal of impurities soluble in the entrainer, f) optionally, separation of hydrogen fluoride from the HCl-rich gas,   g) drying of the HCl-rich gas by means of sorption, with the sorbent being regenerated and aqueous condensate thus formed being fed to wastewater treatment and h) treatment of the entrainer by evaporation of water and removal of impurities by means of precipitation and filtration, with on the one hand an aqueous condensate formed being recirculated to the gas scrub and, on the other hand, solids filtered off being fed to wastewater treatment for the purpose of chlorine recovery. The process makes it possible to recover, for example, about 99% of the chlorine from PVC-containing waste. The hydrogen chloride produced can be used for the preparation of new vinyl chloride by oxichlorination.

A process for the production of hydrogen chloride, HCl, 
from chlorous waste material, comprising the following 

steps: 

incineration of the waste material, 
production of crude acid by means of gas washing 
from the flue gas formed during incineration; 
treatment of waste water, which is partially 
produced during flue gas washing, whereby residual 

waste having a high solids content and also a high-chloride 
solution are produced, 
return of the high-chloride solution to the 
incineration stage for the purpose of the recovery 

of chlorine, 
entrainer distillation of the crude acid to form an 
HCl-rich gas with the simultaneous removal of 

impurities soluble in the entrainer, 
if necessary separation of hydrogen fluoride from 
the HCl-rich gas, 
drying the HCl-rich gas by means of sorption, 
whereby the sorbent is regenerated and an aqueous 

condensate produced as a result is supplied to the 
waste water treatment, and also 
refinement of the entrainer by evaporation of water 
and removal of impurities by means of precipitation 

and filtration, whereby firstly a resultant aqueous 
condensate is returned to the gas washing stage and 

secondly filtered-off solids are supplied to the 
waste water treatment for the purpose of the 

recovery of chlorine. 
A process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 waste containing PVC is 
incinerated.

pressure required for oxychlorination during the 
manufacture of VC. 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

 during the flue gas washing by 
multi-stage absorption a crude acid, which is at least 

almost azeotropic, is produced, whereby the absorption 
process is operated adiabatically or with forced air 

cooling. 
A process according to Claim 4,
