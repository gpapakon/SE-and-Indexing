<ABSTRACT>
A device is provided for the purpose of increasing arterial blood flow to the lower leg, calf, ankle and foot. The device is a compression boot, or cast (12), and consists of a mono-compartment bladder (26) enclosed in a non-elastic outer envelope (30) connected to an air compressor (36) with regulator valve, providing fast inflation to pressures over 80 mm Hg, within 0.5 seconds. This high pressure compression phase is sustained for 2 seconds. Decompression occurs rapidly, within 0.5 seconds, by venting a large valve to the atmosphere. During the resulting low pressure phase (pressure 0-30 mm Hg), which lasts between 8-14 seconds, there is a marked increase in arterial blood flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for applying pressure to a leg for improving
arterial blood circulation, said device comprising a leg cast, an inflatable bladder,
and means for inflating said bladder, said leg cast being adapted to receive the
calf, foot and ankle of said leg, closure means being provided on said cast to
secure said cast about said leg, said bladder being attached to an inside surface of
said cast, said bladder being inflated and constrained within said cast for applying
pressure to said leg at specific regions. Improvement of the arterial blood flow, in patients with
obstruction of the arteries to the leg, is usually obtained by
surgically bypassing the occluded arteries, or by removing
obstructions with devices that are inserted into the blood
vessel. In elderly patients who have undergone multiple
vascular procedures, the deterioration of arterial blood flow
can lead to severe pain (ischemic neuritis), tissue loss
(arterial ulcers) or toe loss (gangrene). When the arteries
cannot be repaired anymore, this situation may lead to leg
amputation. An external compression device is herein
described that could improve arterial blood flow in order to
treat ischemic pain and ulceration, and obviate the need for
amputation, thereby eliminating the risks of surgery. From US-A-4 502 470 a physiologic device is known for treating the leg extremities.
The device contains a fluid filled compartment which is surrounded by an
outer sheath fastened to the foot. When the person wearing the device is walking,
hydraulic forces developed in the compartment are directed into the ankle and
lower leg, so that swelling is prevented and ulcers due to bad veins can be healed.
Although this device may be of some help to patients who can walk, it would be
completely ineffective for a patient who is unable to get out of bed.It is therefore an object of the invention to increase arterial blood flow from the
heart towards the foot, in patients with arterial obstruction, and who are unable to
walk.This is achieved by a device as defined in the pre-characterizing clause of claim 1,
and which is characterized in that said bladder
comprises a single compartment for
simultaneous compression of specific
regions of the leg, and 
is adapted for restricted, non-circumferential
engagement with specific regions of said leg and, said bladder
having a configuration adapted to approximate a location of said regions comprising
said calf, an inside face of said ankle behind the medial ankle bone and in front
of the Achilles

<CLAIMS>
A device for applying pressure to a leg for improving arterial blood circulation,
said device comprising a leg cast (12), an inflatable bladder (26), and means

for inflating said bladder, said leg cast being adapted to receive the calf, foot and
ankle of said leg, closure means (24) being provided on said cast to secure said

cast about said leg, said bladder being attached to an inside surface of said cast,
said bladder being inflated and constrained within said cast for applying pressure

to said leg at specific regions,

characterized in that

said bladder (26) comprises a single compartment for simultaneous compression of
specific regions of the leg, and is adapted for restricted, non-circumferential

engagement with specific regions of said leg and, said bladder having a configuration
adapted to approximate a location of said regions comprising said calf, an

inside face of said ankle behind the medial ankle bone and in front of the Achilles
tendon and the heel bone, and an underside of said foot at the arch area thereof;

and
said means for inflating said bladder (26) comprises a compressor (36), said
compressor having tubing (34) in fluid communication with said bladder, said

compressor further having means for controlling the amount and duration of
pressure delivered to said bladder.
The device of claim 1 in which said compressor (36) is capable of delivering
a pressure of 80 mm Hg in 0.3-0.5 seconds to said specific regions of said leg

simultanously.
The device of claim 1 in which said compressor (36) is capable of delivering
a pressure of 105 mm Hg in 2.5 seconds to said specific regions of said leg

simultaneously.
The device of claim 1 in which said compressor (36) is capable of delivering

pressure simultaneously to said specific regions of said leg in a first phase of 80
mm Hg in 0.3-0.5 seconds and a second phase of 105 mm Hg in 2.5 seconds.
The device of claim 4 in which means are provided for substantially completely
decompressing said inflated bladder (26) in 0.3-0.5 seconds.
The device of any preceeding claim in which heating means (28) are provided
in said cast (12) adapted for warming said ankle and foot to a temperature

between 30-35Â°C, whereby, during use, enlargement of the veins is stimulated for
increased circulation, said heating means (28) comprising a heating pad.
