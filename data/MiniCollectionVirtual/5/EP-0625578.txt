<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates firstly to a process for the preparation of a sweetener in which sucrose is converted enzymatically into a saccharide mixture which is called "isomerised sucrose" and has a disaccharide content of more than 85% by weight, then non-isomerised remaining sucrose is removed from the latter by enzymatic and/or H

 ion-catalysed cleavage, and this product is catalytically hydrogenated, the resulting mixture being subjected, preferably either before or after the catalytic hydrogenation, to a chromatographic separation. It also relates to sweeteners which have preferably been prepared by this process and which contain either a mixture of   10 to 50% by weight of 6-O- alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (= 1.6 GPS) 2 to 20% by weight of 1-O- alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (= 1.1 GPS) 30 to 70% by weight of 1-O- alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannitol (= 1.1 GPM) or of 5 to 10% by weight of 6-O- alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (= 1.6 GPS) 30 to 40% by weight of 1-O- alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (= 1.1 GPS) 45 to 60% by weight of 1-O- alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannitol (= 1.1 GPM)

Method for producing a sweetening agent having a content of 6-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol 
(=1,6-GPS), 1-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (=1,1-GPS) 

and 1-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannitol (=1,1-GPM) by enzymatically 
converting saccharose into a product containing mainly isomaltulose, and later 

hydrogenation to form products containing 1,6-GPS, 1,1-GPM and 1,1-GPS 

characterised in that
a) in a first method step, saccharose is enzymatically converted using immobilised 
cells of bacteria strains from the group of Protaminobacter rubrum 

(CBS 574.77), Serratia plymuthica (ATCC 15928), Serratia marcescens (NCIB 
8285), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (NRRL-B 512 F(ATCC 1083a)) and Erwinia 

rhapontici (NCPPB 1578) into a saccharide mixture, which is termed "isomerised 
saccharose" and contains trehalulose and isomaltulose, having a disaccharide 

portion of more than 85% by weight, 
b) in a second step the "isomerised saccharose" is freed from non-isomerised 
remaining saccharose by enzymatic and/or H
+
-catalysed dissociation, 
c) in a further method step the "isomerised saccharose" is catalytically hydrogenated, 
in which case preferably 
d) either before or after the catalytic hydrogenation, the mixture which is 
obtained is subjected to chromatographic separation, 
e) and the sweetening agent is isolated which contains 10 to 50% by 
weight 1,6-GPS, 2 to 20% by weight 1,1-GPS and 30 to 70% by weight 

1,1-GPM. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the chromatograhic 
separation for removing the oligosaccharide alcohols and/or monosaccharide 

alcohols contained in the mixture is carried out on strongly acidic cationic exchanger  
 

resins charged with sodium ions, potassium ions or calcium ions, or on 
zeolites having a Si/Al ratio of 
>
50. 
Sweetening agent having a content of 1,6-GPS, 1,1-GPS and 1,1-GPM, 
produced according to a method in accordance with claims 1 or 2, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains
 
   10 to 50% by weight 1,6-GPS,
 
   2 to 20% by weight 1,1-GPS and
 
   30 to 70% by weight 1,1-GPM. 
Sweetening agent according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 it contains
 
   25 to 50% by weight 1,6-GPS,
 
   2 to 20% by weight 1,1-GPS,
 
   35 to 60% by weight 1,1-GPM. 
Sweetening agent according to one of the claims 3 or 4 
characterised in 
that
 it contains small amounts of mannitol, sorbitol, hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated 
oligosaccharide (degree of polymerisation DP 
>
 3) or mixtures of 
these. 
Use of sweetening agents according to one of the claims 3,4 or 5 in 
solid or liquid form as a sweetening agent for foodstuffs and luxury foods.
