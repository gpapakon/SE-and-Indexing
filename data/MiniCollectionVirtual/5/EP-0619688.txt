<ABSTRACT>
A plastic-molded frame 3 has a bottom-closed 
cylindrical magnetic circuit holding portion 2 which has a 

positioning projection 6 provided in a central portion on a 
bottom surface 2a of the magnetic circuit holding portion 

2. A magnetic circuit is incorporated in the magnetic 
circuit holder 2 by putting a bottom plate 9 on the bottom 

2a such that a positioning recess 12 in the lower surface 
of the bottom plate 9 engages the positioning projection 6, 

next putting a ring-shaped magnet 13 on the bottom plate by 
using a magnet guide 11 on the bottom plate 9, next putting 

a top plate 14 on the magnet 13, and next urging the top 
plate 14 down and rotating it in a predetermined direction 

such that engaging portions 16 provided along the outer 
circumferential edge of the top plate 14 engage with 

engaging projections 8 extending from the upper open end of 
the magnetic circuit holder 2 and such that slanted 

surfaces 7 of the engaging projections 8 tightly contract 
the entirety of the members 14, 13, 9 in the magnetic 

circuit holder 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a speaker for use in 
various types of acoustic apparatuses, and more particularly, 
to a speaker whose speaker frame is molded of a heat 
resistant plastic resin and does not need any adhesive to 
assemble its magnetic circuit. It has been known from, for example, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication Sho 58-171197, Japanese Utility Model 
Post-Examination Publication Sho-63-49993 and Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication Sho 60-180300 and others, that 
a speaker frame may be made of polycarbonate or other 
engineering plastic excellent in resistance to heat, 
mechanical strength, resistance to abrasion, an so on. Among them, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open 
Publication Hei 2-21998 discloses an arrangement for easily 
assembling a magnetic circuit to a speaker frame by 
sequentially stacking, from the base, a lower plate, a 
plastic magnet, an upper plate and a frame such that 
coupling projections standing from the plastic magnet 
engage with holes provided in the other members, then 
heating the assembly to secure the coupling projections of 
the plastic magnet to the other members due to thermal 
fusion, and fixing the upper plate to the bottom of the 
plastic frame by deforming the coupling projections of the 
upper plate to sit on the bottom plate of the plastic 
frame. This technique is certainly excellent in that it 
can make up a speaker having a plastic frame without using 
an adhesive for coupling respective constituent elements. The said technique, however, requires coupling  
 
projections standing from some locations of upper and lower 
surfaces of the ring-shaped plastic magnet and engaging 
holes provided in the upper and lower plates to receive the 
coupling projections. Therefore, many steps are required 
to prepare respective components of the magnetic circuit, 
and any error in positional relations between coupling 
projections and holes makes the assemblage of the magnetic 
circuit difficult. Moreover, although the known technique does not need 
caulking, fixing by bolts or bonding with an adhesive, it 
still needs hot bonding by using a high-frequency heater, 
and hence requires a large-scaled apparatus in the manufacturing 
process. Therefore, and for other reasons, the 
known technique fails to reduce the cost of the speaker, 
which and other factors still remain as problems to be 
solved. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide 
a speaker simply and easily assembled without using an 
adhesive. A speaker according to the invention

<CLAIMS>
A speaker comprising: 
   a plastic frame having integrally formed a bottom-closed 

cylindrical magnetic circuit holding portion, a 
mount portion for fixing an outer circumferential edge of a 

diaphragm above said magnetic circuit holding portion, and 
a mount surface for mounting the speaker, said frame 

further having a positioning projection provided in a 
central portion on a bottom surface of said magnetic circuit 

holding portion, and a plurality of engaging projections 
extending from an inner surface of said magnetic 

circuit holding portion at an open end thereof at predetermined 
intervals, each said engaging projection defining a 

slanted lower surface sloping down toward said bottom from 
one end to another; 

   a bottom plate having a positioning recess in a 
central portion of a lower surface thereof for engaging 

said positioning projection, a center pole in a central 
portion of an upper surface thereof, and a circular rib on 

an upper surface thereof to behave as a magnet guide; 
   a ring-shape
d magnet having an inner circumferential 
surface engageable with said magnet guide; and 

   a top plate having integrally formed a plurality of 
engaging portions horizontally extending along the outer 

circumferential portion thereof for engaging the engaging 
projections of said frame. 
A method for manufacturing a speaker, comprising the 
steps of: 

   using a plastic frame having integrally formed, 
above a bottom-closed cylindrical magnetic circuit holding 

portion, a mount portion for fixing an outer circumferential 
edge of a diaphragm above said magnetic circuit holding 

portion and a mount surface for mounting the speaker; 
   concentrically putting a bottom plate having a 

 
center pole by engaging a positioning recess in a central 

portion of a lower surface thereof with a positioning 
projection in a central portion on a bottom surface of said 

magnetic circuit holding portion; 
   putting a ring-shaped magnet on said bottom plate by 

utilizing a magnet guide on an upper surface of said bottom 
plate; 

   putting on said magnet a top plate having a 
plurality of engaging portions horizontally extending along 

the outer circumferential portion thereof by using said 
center pole as a guide such that said engaging portions of 

the top plate are offset in the rotational direction from 
said engaging projections of the frame; and 

   rotating said top plate in a predetermined direction 
with respect to the frame such that said engaging portions 

of the top plate engage with and move along slanted 
surfaces defined by lower surfaces of said engaging projections 

of the frame until said top plate is urged to a 
substantially maximum downward position and tightly holds a 

magnetic circuit in the magnetic circuit holding portion.
