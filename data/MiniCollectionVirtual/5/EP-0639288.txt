<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for 
validating coins. It is known to provide in such apparatus one or 
more inductive sensors which generate electromagnetic 
fields in a test region through which a coin is 
arranged to travel. The coin influences the field to 
an extent dependent upon the dimensions and/or 
material of the coin. The inductive sensor, and the 
circuit to which it is coupled, may be arranged so 
that the influence of the coin on the electromagnetic 
field is predominantly determined by the coin 
material, the coin diameter or the coin thickness. 
The inductive sensors tend to be of a size comparable 
to that of the coins which they are intended to 
validate, to ensure sufficient sensitivity. This, 
coupled with the fact that the electromagnetic fields 
generate eddy currents throughout the body of the 
coin, results in the inductive sensors tending to be 
responsive to the bulk or average properties of the 
coin. Some coins, however, are formed of a composite 
of two or more materials, such as a central core of a 
first metal surrounded by one or more outer rings of 
a second or respective further types of metal. 
Conventional sensors cannot easily discriminate  
 
between these bimetallic (or, in general, multi-metallic) 
coins and homogeneous coins made of a 
material which influences the sensor to substantially 
the same extent as the average influence produced by 
materials of the non-homogeneous coins. Also, because 
the sensors can detect effects on the electromagnetic 
field over a large distance, they tend to be less 
sensitive to the precise position of the coin and 
therefore not particularly accurate at measuring coin 
geometry. WO91/15003 discloses a validator for bimetallic 
coins in which first and second relatively small Hall 
effect sensors are provided, at different heights 
from, and positions along, a coin track so as to sense 
different portions of a coin simultaneously and the 
sensor outputs are thresholded to validate a coin. US4742903 discloses a validator for bimetallic 
coins in which the outputs of several sensors along a 
coin track are separately derived and supplied, in 
time-division-multiplex form, for separate processing. US4870360 discloses a coin validator in which a 
first Hall effect sensor is positioned on a coin 
track, and a second is positioned away from the track 
or adjacent to a reference coin, and the difference 
between the two sensor outputs (set to be null in the 
absence of a coin) is used to validate multi-metallic  
 
coins.

<CLAIMS>
A coin validator for composite coins (2) 
consisting of a first material core (3') surrounded by 

one or more rings (3")of one or more second materials 
comprising means (8) defining a coin path for 

conveying coins to be tested, and a sensing circuit 
comprising two spaced magnetic sensors (12, 14) each 

substantially smaller in width than the diameter of a 
composite coin (2) with which the validator is to be 

used, the sensors (12, 14) being positioned such that 
they are passed in succession by a coin (2) travelling 

along the path (8), and so that they can be affected 
simultaneously by a coin (2) passing the sensors (12, 

14), the circuit further including means (22 - 38, 
120) responsive to the difference between the outputs 

of the sensors (12, 14) whilst respective regions (3' 
3") of different metals of a coin (2) are affecting 

the respective sensors (12, 14), to determine whether 
signals provided thereby are representative of a 

genuine coin. 
A validator according to claim 1 in which 
the sensors (12, 14) are positioned at approximately 

the same displacement from the path (8).  
 
A validator as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2, wherein each sensor (12, 14) is an inductance. 
A validator as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the sensors (12, 14) are connected in 

respective arms of a bridge circuit (22 - 32). 
A validator according to any preceding claim 
in which the sensor outputs are substantially equal in 

the absence of a coin (2). 
A method of validating composite coins (2) 
consisting of a core material (3') surrounded by one 

or more rings (3") of one or more second materials, 
the method comprising causing a said composite coin 

(2) to move past magnetic sensor means (12, 14) 
substantially smaller in width than the diameter of 

the coin (2), characterised by comprising deriving a 
signal portion which represents the difference between 

the respective outputs of the sensor means (12, 14) at 
times when respective different regions (3', 3") of 

said coin (2) of different materials are proximate 
said sensor means (12, 14), and determining whether 

the waveform of the signal indicates the presence of 
a coin ring material which differs from the core 

material based on said signal portion.  
 
A method according to claim 6, in which the 
sensor means comprises two spaced apart sensors (12, 

14). 
A method of determining the diameter of a 
coin (2), the method including the step of causing the 

coin (2) to move in succession past two magnetic 
sensors (12, 14) each having a width substantially 

smaller than the diameter of the coin (2), the sensors 
(12,14) being positioned such that they are 

simultaneously influenced by the coin (2), and the 
method including the step of deriving a signal which 

represents the difference between the outputs of the 
sensors (12, 14), and deriving the coin diameter from 

a measurement of the time between respective parts of 
the signal waveform. 
A method according to claim 7 or claim 8 in 
which the sensors (12, 14) are inductances. 
A method according to claim 7, 8 or 9 in 
which the sensors are connected in a bridge circuit 

(22-32). 
A method according to any of claims 6 to 10 
in which the sensor outputs are substantially equal in 

the absence of a coin (2).
