<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of automatically 
controlling a waste water purification plant comprising the steps of 
measuring one or more of a number of system parameters, determining 
a control parameter on the basis of the measurement results obtained 
and a selected control function, selecting a control action on the 
basis of the determined control parameter, and subsequently 
implementing the selected control action. In a prior art method of the type mentioned above, control is 
effected of biological waste water plants, wherein it is desired to 
carry out a microbial removal of the nitrogen and phosphorous 
containing compounds as well as organic matter. A variety of embodiments of such biological purification plants are 
known, but they generally have the common feature that they comprise 
a nitrification tank or zone operated in aerobic conditions, a 
denitrification tank or zone operated in anoxic conditions and a 
clarification tank in which a sedimentation of active sludge is 
carried out and from which tank part of the active sludge is 
generally recycled to the nitrification and/or denitrification tank. The above-mentioned group of purification plant types comprises two 
main types, viz. plants wherein recycling of completely or partially 
treated waste water is effected and plants comprising two treatment 
tanks which are alternately operated in anoxic and aerobic 
conditions, and in which plants no recycling of completely or 
partially treated waste water is effected. In the prior art method an initial measurement is carried out of a 
given parameter, such as the oxygen concentration and the ammonium 
concentration, in the aerobic tank. On the basis of the measurement 
result obtained the state of the aerobic tank is identified, and 
subsequently the identified plant state and a preselected control 
criterium, e.g. maintenance of the oxygen concentration in the 
aerobic tank at a desired level, form the basis of a selection of a 
control action, e.g. in the form of a change in the oxygen supply  
 
rate. Identification of the plant state is effected by means of a 
mathematical model for the relevant purification process 
quantitatively describing the correlation between the various 
measurement parameters. The mathematical model allows i.a. control carried out using a given 
control criterium related to a specific measurement parameter, to be 
carried out on the basis of a measurement of another parameter, e.g. 
the oxygen set point may be controlled on the basis of a
