<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for providing Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) 
service from a mixture of local and remote agents. The remote agents (e.g. at 3) are 

connected via a voice connection (2,11) to the home switch (1) of the ACD and 
voice data connection (2,10) to a Home Agent Server (HAS) (6). The HAS (6) 

passes call event data to a Management Information System (MIS) (8) of the ACD, 
which informs the ACD switch (1) of call events that make a remote agent available 

or unavailable, and passes applications data to a host processor (7) for serving the 
applications of the ACD. Advantageously, ACD service can be provided efficiently 

and economically from a remote server.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to arrangements for allowing physically separated
agents to work as a member of an automatic call distributor (ACD) team.The revolution in telecommunications is starting to make it possible to
realize an old dream, that of being able to work as effectively from a home as from
an office. Many people, especially those in the computer industry, are able to
complete a large part of their work from work stations or personal computers in their
homes. So far, however, such applications as permitting telephone agents to work
from their homes have not achieved wide acceptance. Generally, it has been difficult
to maintain adequate surveillance of such agents and the cost of providing
telecommunications access to such agents has been sufficiently high to discourage
the practice. Accordingly, a problem of the prior art is that no sound economical
way has been found for allowing telephone agents that are a part of an automatic call
distributor team to be physically separated from the other members of the team.This problem has been solved and an advance made over the prior art in
accordance with the principles of my invention, wherein a work at home agent
selected to serve a call by an ACD control system is connected to the caller on an
audio link, and is connected to a home agent server (HAS) unit via a data
connection. The HAS unit distributes work at home agent status changes to a
management information system for maintaining surveillance of the agent, and to the
ACD control system so that the availability of the agent to serve a new call can be
noted by the ACD control system, and transmits application data from and to a host
computer for providing and accepting applications data to and from the work at
home agent. Advantageously, this arrangement offers an inexpensive way of
providing an audio connection to the work at home agent (the connection is
maintained only for the duration of the calls to the agent), and offers the agent a
single data path to obtain and accept applications data, and to provide data for
updating management information system and the agent availability information for
the ACD. FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the operation of applicant's
invention; andFIGS. 2-5 are flow diagrams illustrating the methods of performing the
invention.FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the operation of applicant's
invention. Incoming calls go to a switch 1 which is the host switch for the automatic
call distributor (ACD) which distributes calls to the agents of the called
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of providing an automatic call distributor (ACD) service for an
ACD system, the ACD system being served by a first switching system, the ACD

service being provided from an agent station (3) connected to a second switching
system different from the first switching system, the method comprising the steps of:


(a) in response to an incoming call to the ACD system from the first switching
system, establishing an audio path to couple the incoming call to an agent station (3)

via a public switched telephone network connection between the first and second
switching systems; and
(b) establishing a data connection from the agent station (3) to a home agent
server (HAS) (6) for communicating agent status data to the ACD system and for

providing data from the HAS (6) to the agent station (3), step (b) being carried out
before step (a);

   the method being characterised in that it further comprises the step of
providing the data connection path through a proprietary data network that is

independent of the audio path provided by the public switched telephone network.
A method as claimed in claim 1 and further comprising the steps of: providing
agent status data to a Management Information System (8) from the HAS (6); and

maintaining the availability status of agents of the ACD including the agent station
(3).
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 and further comprising the step of, in
response to an agent logging on, having the HAS (6) inform the ACD system of the

agent's logging on.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 and further comprising the steps of:
detecting in the HAS (6) an outgoing call from the agent station (3); and informing

the ACD system that the agent station (3) is not available for ACD calls.
An apparatus for providing an automatic call distributor (ACD) service for an
ACD system, the ACD system being served by a first switching system, the ACD 

service being provided from an agent station (3) connected to a second switching
system different from the first switching system, the apparatus comprising:


(a) means for establishing, in response to an incoming call to the ACD system
from the first switching system, an audio path to couple the incoming call to an agent

station (3) via a public switched telephone network connection between the first and
second switching systems; and
(b) means for establishing a data connection from the agent station (3) to a home
agent server (HAS) (6) for communicating agent status data to the ACD system and

for providing data from the HAS (6) to the agent station (3);

   the apparatus being characterised in that it further comprises a proprietary data
network for providing the data connection from the agent station (3) to a home agent

server (6), the proprietary data network being independent of the public switched
telephone network providing the audio path.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5 and further comprising means for
providing agent status data from the HAS (6) to a Management Information System

(8) and for maintaining the availability status of agents of the ACD including the
agent station (3).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6 wherein, in response to an agent
logging on, the HAS (6) is adapted to inform the ACD system of the agent's logging

on.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7 and further comprising
means for detecting in the HAS (6) an outgoing call from the agent station (3), and for

informing the ACD system that the agent station (3) is not available for ACD calls.
