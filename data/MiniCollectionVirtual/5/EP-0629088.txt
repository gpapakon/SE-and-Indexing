<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a Teletext signals decoder; 
the main characteristic of the invention consists in that the 

decoder foresees first means (5) for memorising a displayed page, 
in particular an index page, and second means for 

successively calling from the memory (5) said memorised page, 
even if it is not the last displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Teletext signals decoder.
It is known that in various European countries, from among
which Italy, systems are in use (generally known with the
English term "teletext", and specifically named "Televideo"
in Italy and "Videotext" in Germany) that allow for the
transmission, together with the normal television signals,
additional information, inserted in the video signal (under
the form of coded digital signals) in several of the
horizontal lines that are free during the vertical return
period.Such coded signals, upon a command by the user, are detected
by an appropriate decoding circuit, known and generally
realised by means of monolithic integrated circuits, inserted
in the circuits of the television set, so as to allow the
display on the television screen of one of the transmitted
information pages, containing text or graphics.
The number of pages normally transmitted are of several
hundred, grouped by subject; the first page (page 100) 
usually contains the general subject index, and in the
successive pages the sub-indexes for each subject, with the
relative page numbers. The user has to, each time it is
desired to receive a determined page, input a sequence using
three numbered keys so as to form the number the three digit
number of the searched page; the decoder begins to receive
the pages as they are transmitted, one after the other, by
the broadcaster; as soon as the page distinguished by the
sequence of digits inputted by the user is transmitted, the
decoder provides for its acquisition.The main drawback of teletext is the difficulty of the
selection mechanism and the amount of time necessary for the
acquisition; numerous systems have been proposed for reducing
such drawback (TOP, FLOF, TOPLESS).In the TOP system the grouping of the pages is organised
according to a structure of two levels (blocks and groups).The command device, generally a remote control, is equipped
with four supplement keys, each coloured in a different
manner, which allow for the access, respectively, to the next
page of the group, to the first page of the next group
(typically containing the relative index), to the first page
of the successive block (typically containing the relative
index), to the previous page selected. In other
implementations the fourth access key provides access to the
previous page of the group.Decoders of the type TOP improve the ease of use of Teletext,
but also increase the costs of the decoder.On the other hand the decoders without TOP have an ease of
use being

<CLAIMS>
Teletext signals decoder, comprising first means (M, 102) for memorising a
displayed index page, and second means (R, 104) for successively recalling from the

memory a page previously memorised, even if it is not the last displayed, characterised in that
said first means for memorising a displayed index page comprise a logic control circuit (8)

that provides to analyse the page currently displayed and to automatically memorise it
every time that it is an index page.
Teletext signals decoder, according to claim 1, characterised in that said first
means for memorising a displayed index page comprise a key or button (M).
Teletext signals decoder, according to claim 1, characterised in that said second
means for recalling a page previously memorised comprise a key or button (R).
Teletext signals decoder, according to claim 2, characterised in that the decoder
comprises control means (101) which determine when said key or button (M) has

been pressed and for activating memorising means (102) of the page currently
displayed.
Teletext signals decoder, according to claim 3, characterised in that the decoder
comprises control means (103) which determine when said key or button (R) has been

pressed and for activating recalling means (104) and display means (104) of the page
previously memorised.
Receiver of television signals utilising a teletext signals decoder according to one
or more of the previous claims.
