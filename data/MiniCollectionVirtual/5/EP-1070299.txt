<ABSTRACT>
A library terminal permits a user to execute a loan transaction without assistance. The library terminal (i) provides a visible scan line from a bar code reader indicating the correct positioning of the bar code on a circulating item, (ii) leads a user through a loan transaction, (iii) provides an explicit feedback to a user when an article has an improper position on the article receiving area, (iv) both checks out and checks in circulating items, (v) stores fonts in bit maps of screen displays instead of in a separate font memory, (vi) integrates a security marker reader, a printer, and a controller in the same housing, (vii) processes financial transactions related to the borrowing of circulating items, and/or (viii) displays actions for helping the user to correct errors in use of the terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a library
terminal which may be used, for example, by borrowers
to check circulating (lendable) items out of, and/or to return
circulating items to, a library.Many businesses and other enterprises are
increasingly automating their systems in order to
reduce operating cost and improve service. When such
systems are used by the customers of these businesses
and other enterprises, automation typically involves
self-service facilities which allow customers to
satisfy their own requirements. For example, financial
institutions and library systems are beginning to use
self-service terminals in order to reduce costs and to
improve service. In the case of libraries, the
libraries' patrons may use these self-service library
terminals to conduct at least some of their business
with the libraries.US-A-5 140 141 describes a bar-code reader for reading bar codes on articles or
commodities in supermarkets or retail stores that has a scanning unit mounted on a vertically
movable support post assembly and includes a scanning system which emits a scanning light
beam and detects light reflected from a bar code. The bar-code reader includes various
indicating members, such as an indicator rod, an indicator ring, an arrow mark, a pattern
mark, and a coloured sheet, for indicating to the operator a direction, a position, and an area or
zone in which to pass an article with a bar code in order for the bar code to be successfully
read by the scanning system.US-A-4 141 078 describes an automated library circulation control system that
includes a plurality of remote book processing terminals and a computer controlling the
terminals and processing data between the terminals and the computer to maintain a current
inventory of the circulation status of the library books. The system provides for automatic
charging of library materials by patrons, record keeping of all library transactions,
modification and interrogation of computer data files, intercommunication between the
computer and a remote data processor and detection of unauthorized removal of books from
the library. Each terminal has a card reader for patron identification, an optical reader for
book identification, an electromagnetic activator for magnetizing and de-magnetizing a
magnetic strip in each book, a printer for printing charge-out information, and a display
screen and keyboard for communications between patron and computer.US-A-4 153 931 describes an on-line computerized system useful in automatic
document control and inventory

<CLAIMS>
A library terminal (10) comprising:

a housing (12),
an item receiving area (14) incorporated in the housing,
wherein the item receiving area is arranged to receive

a lendable item;
a video cassette receiving area (30) incorporated in the housing,
wherein the video cassette receiving area is arranged to receive

a video cassette;
a reading means (18, 74) supported by the housing and arranged to
read an identifier on the lendable item and the video cassette when the lendable

item is placed in the item receiving area (14) and when the video cassette
is placed in the video cassette receiving area (30); and,
a controller (60), wherein the controller is contained
within the housing, and wherein the controller is coupled to 

the reading means (18, 74).
The library terminal of claim 1 wherein
reading means comprises:


a bar code reader (18) supported by the housing and arranged
to read a bar code on the lendable item when the

lendable item is placed in the item receiving area (14), and,
a video cassetle reader (74) supported by the housing and arranged
to read the identifier on the video cassette when the video cassette is placed in the

video cassette receiving area (30).
The library terminal of claim 1 or 2 further
comprising a magnetic stripe reader (34), wherein the magnetic

stripe reader is contained within the housing, wherein the
housing has an opening, wherein the opening is arranged to

permit access to the magnetic stripe reader from outside of
the housing, and wherein the controller (60) is coupled to the

magnetic stripe reader.
The library terminal of claim 1, 2 or 3 further
comprising a display (28), wherein the display is contained

within the housing so that the display is viewable by a
user, and wherein the controller is arranged to control the

display in order to display screen displays to the user.
The library terminal of any of claims 1 to 4 further 
comprising a transducer (40), wherein the transducer is supported

by the housing so that the transducer is arranged to provide
an audible feedback of the operation of the library terminal

by a user.
The library terminal of any of claims 1 to 5 further
comprising a security marker reader (24), wherein the security

marker reader is contained within the housing adjacent to
the item receiving area (14), and wherein the security marker

reader is arranged to read a security marker attached to the
lendable item.
The library terminal of any of claims 1 to 6 further
comprising a keypad (32), wherein the keypad is supported by the

housing so that the keypad is arranged to interact with a
user during returns and loans of lendable items.
The library terminal of any of claims 1 to 7 further
comprising a connector, wherein the connector is arranged to

couple the library terminal over a link (72) to a library
system, and wherein the controller (60) is arranged to store loan

transactions during periods when the link to the library
system is down so that the loan transactions can be later

transferred to the library system.
