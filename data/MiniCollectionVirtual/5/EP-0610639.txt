<ABSTRACT>
Applicator for make-up or for a hair-treatment product, including a reservoir (110) containing the product to be applied, a removable cap (120) intended to close the reservoir, an application member (121) carried by the end of a wand (rod) (122) integral with the cap (120) which has a closure bearing surface (123) intended to interact with a seat made in line with the opening of the reservoir (110), a handle (130) being articulated around a pin (133) carried by the cap (120) and consisting of at least one arch (131), the dimensions of which are such that, in the completely folded position of the handle (130), the said arch (131) surrounds the said reservoir (110), the said arch (131) being equipped with a locking stop (132) interacting with the bottom (112) of the said reservoir in this completely folded position of the handle (130), this interaction applying the said closure bearing surface (123) on the said seat in a leaktight fashion.

Applicator for makeup or for a hair-care product, 
including a reservoir (10, 110, 210, 310) containing the 

product to be applied, a removable cap (20, 120, 220, 
320) intended to close the reservoir, an application 

member (21, 121, 221, 321) carried by the end of a rod 
(22, 122, 222, 322) integral with the cap (20, 120, 220, 

320), the said cap (20, 120, 220, 320) having a closure 
bearing surface (23, 123, 223, 323) intended to interact 

with a seat made in line with the mouth of the reservoir 
(10, 110, 210, 310), characterized in that a handle (30, 

130, 230, 330) is articulated about an axis (33, 133, 
233, 333) carried by the cap (20, 120, 220, 320), the 

said handle consisting of at least one arch (31, 131, 
231, 331) of which the dimensions are such that, in the 

completely folded-up position of the handle (30, 130, 
230, 330), the said arch (31, 131, 231, 331) surrounds 

the said reservoir (10, 110, 210, 310), the said arch 
(31, 131, 231, 331) being equipped with a locking stop 

(32, 132, 232, 332) interacting with the base (12, 112, 
212, 312) of the said reservoir, in this completely 

folded-up position of the handle (30, 130, 230, 330), 
this interaction applying the said closure bearing 

surface (23, 123, 223, 323) of the said cap (20, 120, 
220, 320) in a leaktight manner on the said seat made in 

line with the mouth of the said reservoir (10, 110, 210, 
310). 
Applicator according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the application member (21, 121, 221, 321) consists 

of a brush, a slim brush or an application end made from 
optionally flocked foam. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the said base (12, 112, 212, 312) 

of the said reservoir (10, 110, 210, 310) interacts with 
the said locking stop (32, 132, 232, 332) of the said 

arch (31, 131, 231, 331) by means of a positioning 
counterstop (14, 114, 214, 314). 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 or 3, 
characterized in that the cross section of the reservoir  

 
(10, 110, 210) and the arch (31, 131, 231) have the shape 

of a rectangle. 
Applicator according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the axis (133) of articulation of the handle 

(130) is parallel to the small side of the rectangle. 
Applicator according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the axis (33, 233) of articulation of the handle 

(30, 230) is parallel to the large side of the rectangle. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the longitudinal section of the 

reservoir (310) has the shape of a trapezium and the arch 
(331) matches this trapezoidal shape. 
Applicator according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the arch (331) is a rectangular plate in which an 

opening of trapezoidal shape has been made. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the reservoir (210) has, at its 

periphery, recesses (212A, 212B, 212C) in which the arch 
(231) is fitted to take up position. 
Applicator according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the arch (231) is closed on one side by a wall 

(234). 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the articulation of the handle (30, 

130, 230, 330) is arranged so as to define stable positions 
of orientation of the handle (30, 130, 230, 330) 

with respect to the cap (20, 120, 220, 320).
