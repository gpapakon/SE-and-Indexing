<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a delivery package (30) of a maxi bags (10) and a method for packing maxi bags into a delivery package (30). A delivery package (30) consists of maxi bags (10) placed overlappingly on top of the other, said bags being rolled around a rolling core (20) into a roll package. The edge portions of the maxi bags (10) have been folded prior to being conducted to a rolling core (20) so that in longitudinal direction the maxi bags (10) are essentially of equal thickness, whereby in each maxi bag layer of a delivery package (30) the undesired thickness of the thick handle part of the lifting loop structure (13) of the maxi bags (10) has been made uniform in order to produce a stable delivery package (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a delivery package for 
maxi bags. The invention also relates to a procedure for packing maxi 
bags to form delivery packages. In the state of the art it is generally known 
to produce bag rolls of paper bags, i.e. paper 
bag delivery packages so that the finished paper bags, 
placed at least partly overlapping one on top of the other, are rolled 
around a rolling core, and in the course of the rolling, 
i.e. in the course of forming a delivery package, the paper 
bag layers are tied with the aid of two continuous cords or 
hoops surrounding the bag roll (see, for example, GB-A-1 594 558). The technique described above has also been used in packing 
plastic sacks into delivery packages. Small bags have long been filled completely automatically. 
On the other hand, automatic filling of maxi bags is not 
known in the state of the art, even though automatic filling 
of maxi bags is technically possible. In order to succeed 
in automatic filling of maxi bags, the maxi bags 
should be delivered to the users thereof in a precisely 
organized manner in one way or another, i.e. in a delivery 
package of a given type, so that the grip of a robot or a 
collector means is always able to find a subsequent maxi 
bag to be filled. In maxi bags, particularly in maxi bags provided with 
gathered lifting loops, the gathered lifting loop structure 
generates a considerable thickening compared with the rest 
of the maxi bag structure. Such maxi bags could not to date be 
packed into a roll package, i.e. into a delivery 
package, because it has proved to be impossible to make a  
 
stable roll package. In maxi bags like these the gathered 
lifting loop structure is also in general surrounded with a 
separate handle, whereby when maxi bags are rolled around a 
rolling core so that the lifting handle is placed in the 
middle and the maxi bags are placed one after the other 
overlappingly one on top of the other, the end result would 
be a very uneven roll package owing to the thick and narrow 
handle portion, which, along with the increasing diameter 
of said roll package, would no longer stay in gathered 
form, but would spread apart. The objective of the present invention is to provide a delivery 
package of maxi bags which is sufficiently stable. A 
specific aim of the invention is to provide a delivery 
package of maxi bags enabling automatic maxi bag filling. One more aim of the invention is to provide a method 
for packing maxi bags into delivery packages, enabling the 
provision of a

<CLAIMS>
A delivery package (30) of maxi bags (10) rolled around a 
rolling core (20), each bag (10) overlapping the following one, 

each maxi bag (10) consisting of an envelope (11) with a handle 
part (15), the latter being thicker than the rest of the 

structure of the maxi bag (10), 
characterized
 in that edge 
portions of the envelope (11) are longitudinally folded 

inwardly, thereby enabling the provision of a sufficiently 
uniformly thick and stable roll package. 
A delivery package of maxi bags according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that each of the maxi bag layers in a delivery 
package (30) has been tied with the aid of at least one 

continous cord or hoop (21). 
A delivery package of maxi bags according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the topmost maxi bag layer of the delivery 
package (30) has been tied with the aid of at least one cord or 

hoop (21). 
A delivery package of maxi bags according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
 in that each maxi bag (10) is 
provided with an inner bag (16).  

 
A delivery package of maxi bags according to claim 4, 

characterized
 in that the handle part (15) of the lifting loop 
structure (13) of a maxi bag (10) has been attached to an inner 

bag (16). 
A procedure for packing maxi bags (10) into a delivery 
package (30), 
characterized
 in that 

(a) maxi bags (10) are placed on a packing line overlappingly 
one on top of the other and conducted through folding guides 

(19) in a folding station, said guides (19) folding the 
longitudinal edge portions of the maxi bags (10) inwardly in 

order to enable the provision of a sufficiently uniformly thick 
and stable roll package, and 
(b) the maxi bags (10) folded in edge portions are conducted to 
a rolling core (20) and rolled around said rolling core (20) 

into said roll package. 
A procedure according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in that when 
a delivery package (30) is produced, each of the maxi bag layers 

is tied with at least one continous cord or hoop (21). 
A procedure according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in that the 
topmost maxi bag layer of a completed delivery package (30) is 

tied with the aid of at least one cord or hoop (21). 
A procedure according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 

characterized
 in that the maxi bags (10) positioned 
overlappingly one on top of the other are fed to the folding 

guides (19) of the folding station with the bottom (12) of the 
maxi bag (10) being located frontmost in the feeding direction.
