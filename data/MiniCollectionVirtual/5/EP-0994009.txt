<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural machine, comprising:

a pair of front wheels (12) and a pair of rear
wheels (14), rigidly connected to a main frame (16),
a control cab (18) mounted on the main frame
(16), and
suspension means placed between the cab (18) and
the main frame (16).
Said suspension means comprise a plurality of
actuators (20; 30, 32) for controlling the rotation of

the cab (18) with respect to the main frame (16) about
at least two axis orthogonal to each other. An

electronic control unit (24) is provided with sensor
means for detecting variations of the cab tilt angle

with respect to an horizontal reference direction. The

electronic control unit (24) is programmed for
controlling said actuators so as to maintain a constant

orientation of the cab (18) with respect to said
reference direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present' invention relates to an agricultural
machine according to the preamble of claim 1.The invention has been developed in particular in
view of the application on agricultural tractors of the
type comprising:
a pair of rear wheels rigidly connected to a
main frame, and a pair of front wheels carried by a
front axle mounted for oscillatory movement about a
longitudinal axis of the tractor,a control cab mounted on the main frame, andsuspension means interposed between the cab and
the main frame.Agricultural machines often operate in non-levelled
working conditions, due to either ground
configuration (e.g. hilly ground) or to specific
operations such as furrow plowing in which even on
level ground the tractor is transversally tilted.In all these conditions, the operator loses a
major part of the comfort which the cab can provide on
horizontal ground. In fact, longitudinal inclinations
of the tractor can be compensated only by forces
applied with the legs on the floor and with the arms on
the driving wheel, whereas transversal inclinations are
compensated because the operator leans on the seat
armrests. These positions can be very troublesome for
the operator after a few working hours both for lower
and upper limbs fatigue and for stiffening of the hips
which continuously rest on the lateral armrests. This
produces, in addition to a concentration drop, also a
reduced productivity of the tractor.US-A-4018296 shows a self-levelling tractor which
automatically levels the main frame of the tractor with
respect to the front and rear axle and to the tractor 
wheels. The tractor axles are mounted for oscillatory
movement about a common axis which extends in a
longitudinal direction below the main frame and a pair
of hydraulic cylinders are arranged between the main
frame and the rear axle. A mercury levelling unit is
mounted to the main frame and actuates the hydraulic
cylinders to pivot the main frame to horizontal when
the rear axis and its wheels are tilted because of the
terrain angle.The structure disclosed in US-A-4018296 requires
heavy modifications of the tractor structure for
rendering the rear axle pivotable with respect to the
main frame.JP07215033 discloses
a cap of a vehicle comprising a pair of rear wheels, rigidly connected to a main
frame, and a pair of front wheels connected to the main frame by means of a
front axle, a control cab mounted on the main frame, and suspension means
placed between the cab and the main frame, said suspension means comprise
a plurality of actuators adapted to

control unit (24) operating on the basis of information
provided by sensor means for detecting variations of

the tilt angle of the cab (18) with respect to a
horizontal reference direction, said sensor means

comprising either a biaxial inclinometer or two
monoaxial inclinometers orthogonal to each other, plus

either a biaxial turnmeter or two monoaxial turnmeters;
the suspension system further comprising a pair of

linear actuators (30) connected to the cab (18) by
means of respective elastic supports (26) and a third

linear actuator (32) articulated to a cross beam (34) 
by means of a ball joint (36), said cross beam (34)

being connected to the cab (18) by means of a pair of
elastic supports (38).

 said sensor means are not
affected by variations of the cab tilt angle due to

either transversal or longitudinal acceleration of the

An agricultural machine according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 said electronic control unit (24)
can be set out for compensating cab tilt angles only in

a transversal direction or only in a longitudinal
direction.

exceeding a predetermined safety threshold.
An agricultural machine according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 said suspension means (20; 30,
