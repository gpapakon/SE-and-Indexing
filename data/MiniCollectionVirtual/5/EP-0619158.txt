<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device for clamping a mandrel (28) to an 
elbow or pipe (18) has a plurality of clamping pins 

(62), each pin having a generally cylindrical shape with 
a hemispherical end portion (62a) defining a plurality 

of concentric ridges (64). An axially moveable 
actuating member (72) bears on a second end (70) of the 

centering pins such that movement of the member along 
the longitudinal axis (30) of the mandrel urges each of 

the centering pins into contact with the pipe surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
clamping pin according to the preamble of claim 1 and as known
from US-A-4493232. A
pipe end
preparation tool
provided with a clamping pin according to the present invention
shows
improved pipe
clamping capabilities.Portable lathes for machining the ends of pipes are
well known in the art and typically comprise a mandrel, a
device to clamp the mandrel to the pipe such that it is
aligned with the center line of the pipe and a power unit
mounted on the mandrel. The power unit has a rotatable
portion, to which one or more machining tools are attached,
and a non-rotatable portion slidably attached to the
mandrel. Means are provided on the power unit to move it
axially along the mandrel in order to feed the machining
tools into the end of the pipe. The power unit also comprises a drive mechanism,
attachable to an external power source, to rotate the
rotatable portion to which the machining tool is attached.
Typically, a pneumatically or hydraulically driven motor is
attached to the power unit such that its output shaft is
drivingly connected to the rotatable portion. The drive
may include inter-engaging bevel gears, one such bevel gear
attached to an input shaft, while the meshing bevel gear is
affixed to the rotating portion of the power unit.Clamping means are provided on one end of the mandrel
to clamp it to the pipe. Such clamping means may be either
external, to clamp the mandrel to the exterior of the pipe,
or internal, wherein a portion of the mandrel extends into
and is clamped to the interior of the pipe. The internal
clamping devices typically comprise a plurality of clamping
members mounted on the mandrel so as to move in a radial
direction with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
mandrel. The clamping members are radially expanded or
contracted by axial movement between wedge surfaces formed
on a portion of the mandrel and each of the clamping
members. Such clamping members are usually formed as
narrow, elongated members having a significant length in
the direction of the longitudinal axis of the mandrel.US A 4 493 232 for example, illustrates a prior art adjustable mandrel for a portable
lathe including a torque reacting feature and radially extendible clamps for engaging the
interior of an elbow section of pipe, whereby a portable lathe can be secured to the pipe for
a machining operation.In order to minimize the time for machining the end of
an elbow or a pipe, it is necessary to take as large a cut
per revolution of the machining tool as possible. The

<CLAIMS>
A clamping pin for use in a device for clamping a
mandrel (28) to a pipe (18) including a generally

cylindrical body portion (62) having first (62a) and second
end portions,

said second end portion being provided with an actuating surface
(70), said body portion (62) having

a central axis; characterised
by


a plurality of generally concentric ridges (64)
extending about the central axis on the first end

portion (62a).
The clamping pin according to claim 1 characterised
in that the first end portion (62a) has a generally

hemispherical shape.
The clamping pin according to claim 1 or 2
characterised in that each ridge (64) has sides such

that the included angle (β) between adjacent sides of
adjacent ridges (64) is between 50° and 70°.
The clamping pin according to claim 3 characterised
in that the included angle (β) between adjacent sides of

adjacent ridges (64) is approximately 60°.
A clamping device for attaching a mandrel (28)
having a longitudinal axis (30) to a pipe (18) including 

a clamping head (60) on the mandrel (28), characterised
by a plurality of clamping pins (62) as claimed in any

preceding claim slidably mounted in the clamping head
(60) so as to move in a direction substantially

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel
(28), and an actuating member (72) for driving each

clamping pin (62) relative to the clamping head (60) to
urge the first end (62a) of each pin (62) into contact

with a pipe (18).
The clamping device according to claim 5,
characterised in that the actuating member (72) is

mounted relative to the mandrel (28) so as to move in a
direction generally parallel to the longitudinal axis

(30) of the mandrel (28) and to contact the actuating
surface (70) of each clamping pin (62) such that axial

movement of the actuating member (72) causes radial
movement of each clamping pin (62).
The clamping device according to claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the clamping head (60) is

removably attached to the mandrel (28).
