<ABSTRACT>
A resin coating system having an endless 
conveyor for passing components to be coated with resin 

successively through a preheating station, a resin 
coating station, and a gelification station. Coated 

components are exchanged with uncoated components at a 
transfer station along said conveyor between the 

gelification station and the preheating station. If an 
uncoated component is not ready to be transferred into 

the coating system or later processing machines are not 
ready to receive a coated component, then exchange of 

coated and uncoated components does not take place at 
the transfer station, and the coated component 

reapproaches the preheating and coating stations. A 
system and method for allowing coating of uncoated 

components to be completed while coated components 
passing through the coating station are prevented from 

being recoated is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin coating apparatus and
to a method for coating components of electric motors or
electric generators according to the preamble of claim 1 and
of claim 13 respectively.Resins are often used to coat wire coils
(such as in the present invention). Heatless polyester
resins are capable of bonding strengths equivalent to
those of traditional resins but cure by means of an
exothermic chemical reaction which takes place at room
temperature. Curing in this way accordingly obviates
the heating and cooling stages normally required to
cure traditional resins.Elimination of heating and cooling stages
provides various advantages including: energy savings,
savings in coating system costs, and savings in 
manufacturing spacing which needs to be dedicated to
the heating and cooling equipment required by
traditional resin application systems. The use of
heatless resins also substantially eliminates the
airborne emissions associated with high temperature
curing of traditional resins.A typical cycle for coating armatures with
heatless resins requires heating the wire coils to a
moderate temperature within the range of 45°C to 60°C,
exposing the coils to a series of resin dispensers for
applying progressive amounts of resin to the coils,
allowing the resin to harden, and eventually aging the
resin.Preheating of the components is carried out
so that the resin reaches an ideal viscosity on the
component to penetrate and fill the spacings between
the coil wires. The preheating stage also reduces the
time required for the resin to harden. Accordingly, a
precise choice of the temperature in this stage must be
made, taking into account such factors as: the type of
armature to be coated, the resin being used for
coating, and the production rates required by the
coating operation.The preheated components are passed through a
resin dispensing/coating station in which the
components are coated with resin. Preferably, the
components to be coated are rotated during application
of the resin so that a uniform coat may be formed.The resin coating station typically includes
a plurality of resin dispensers, such as manufactured
by Liquid Control Corp. of North Canton, Ohio. Each
resin dispenser typically comprises a mixer tube in
which resin and a catalyst are fed and mixed. The
resin, such as manufactured by The P.D. George Co.,
St. Louis, Missouri, and the catalyst are stored in 
separate containers and are fed by piston pumps through
supply tubes to a distributor. Until they reach the
outlet of the
