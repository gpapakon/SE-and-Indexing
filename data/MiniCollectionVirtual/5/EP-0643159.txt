<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spinning process, in particular to a dry-spinning process, for producing elastane (spandex) fibres by adding to the elastane spinning solution, before spinning, 0.8 to 2% by weight of polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity of 50 to 300 cSt and 0.2 to 0.6% by weight of ethoxylated polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity of 20 to 150 cSt.
