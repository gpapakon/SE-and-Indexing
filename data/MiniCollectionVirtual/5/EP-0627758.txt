<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid chromatography mode, the gas chromatography 
system of a GC/LC/MS (mass spectrometry) system 

provides a counterflow to an LC particle beam. The 
counterflow increases signal strength and, for some 

relatively high molecular mas analytes, reduces 
fragmentation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass spectrometry and, more 
particularly, to a system and method in which a particle beam is 
introduced into a mass spectrometer for analysis. A major objective of 
the present invention is to provide for a stronger signal strength in the 
mass analyzer output. GC/LC/MS systems, which combine gas chromatography (GC), 
liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), are used for 
several purposes including 1) environmental studies, for example, to 
evaluate water, soil, and waste; 2) food analysis, to identify 
contaminants and adulterants; 3) pharmaceutical development, to 
analyze natural and synthetic products; and 4) life sciences, to 
characterize protein components. Chromatography includes a class of separation techniques in 
which, at any given time during separation, some molecules of a 
component are adsorbed to a stationary solid support, while other 
molecules are carried by a mobile fluid. The adsorbed molecules are 
said to be in a "stationary phase" while the fluid-borne molecules are 
said to be in a "mobile phase". At equilibrium, the rate at which a component's molecules in the 
stationary phase are released to the mobile phase equals the rate at 
which the same component's molecules in the mobile phase are 
adsorbed to the stationary phase. For each component, the ratio of the 
number of molecules in the stationary phase to the number of molecules 
in the mobile phase is quantified by a partitioning coefficient. This  
 
partitioning coefficient thus corresponds to the average percentage of 
time the molecules of a component are in the mobile phase. This 
percentage correlates with the mobility of the component past the solid 
support. Sample components with different mobilities separate, as they 
progress past the solid support. With sufficient separation, the 
components emerge serially in the chromatography effluent. Both liquid chromatography and gas chromatography systems 
are known. In liquid chromatography, the fluid can be an organic liquid 
solvent, an aqueous liquid solvent, or a mixture of organic and aqueous 
solvents. In gas chromatography, the fluid can be a carrier gas. The 
effluent is, of course, liquid in the LC case, and gaseous in the GC case. 
GC tends to be preferred for volatile components, while LC provides a 
complementary alternative for nonvolatile components. To complete the analysis of a sample mixture, the eluting 
components need to be identified and quantified. Mass spectrometers 
provide for fast, sensitive,
