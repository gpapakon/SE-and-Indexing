<ABSTRACT>
An order amount of parts can be calculated from an 
actually used amount of the parts, so that the used parts 

can be resupplied subsequently. An order amount can also be 
calculated from a production plan, so that the parts 

necessary to meet the plan can be delivered. 
In this technique, an order amount is calculated by the 
equation " 


W1·X1 + W2·X2 
 
", where X1 is the order amount 

calculated in a subsequently resupplying way, X2 is the 
order amount calculated in a plan correspondence way, W1 is 

an actual weight, and W2 is a plan weight. The actual 
weight W1 becomes high and the plan weight W2 becomes low 

when the subsequently resupplying way is suitable, and vice 
versa. The actual weight W1 and the plan weight W2 can be 

calculated from experience or system analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a technique of calculating an
order amount in a process of producing products to be
utilized in subsequent processes by using parts delivered
from preceding processes, such that the parts to be
delivered from the preceding processes are neither excessive
nor insufficient.A proposed technique of managing the order amount is
disclosed in the JP-A-62 057 060, published on March 12, 1987.
In this technique, a stock amount detector is
provided to detect the amount of stock of parts in a space
in which parts delivered from preceding processes are
stored. When the detected stock amount becomes less than a
reference stock amount, the shortage amount is ordered. The
technique is a way of subsequently resupplying used parts.Another technique which calculates the order amount by
an MRP (Material Requirement Planning) system is disclosed
in the JP-A-63 192 159, published on August 9, 1988. In
this technique, when a product production plan is given,
parts order amounts are determined from the given product
production plan and such data as the parts list of the 
product and delivery term of the parts, etc. This technique
may be called a plan correspondence system.According to the technique of the subsequently
resupplying system, in demand variation periods, the parts
to be delivered may be excessive or insufficient. In
production increase periods, parts are liable to be
insufficient, which may lead to the stoppage of the
production line. In production reduction periods, the parts
to be delivered may be excessive, giving rise to excessive
stock. There is a further problem that no measure is
prepared to restore the normal stock state from the
excessive stock.In the plan correspondence system, when calculating the
order amount, there is a possibility of failure of accord
between the production plan and the actual demand because
the production plan is determined on the basis of the future
demand forecast. Besides, once the production plan fails to
be observed due to such cause as a trouble in the production
or distribution facilities, over-stock or insufficient stock
of parts is brought about, and there is no means prepared
for making up for the over-stock or insufficient stock of
parts once brought about.Moreover, the GB-A-2 216 691, published on October 11, 1989,
discloses an automatic ordering system which is adapted to
determine the amount of orders so as to procure various
resources. The system comprises means for predicting the
amount of demand in the future on the basis of the amount of

A method of order amount calculation for calculating an
amount of parts to be ordered by a manufacturing process, a

self-process (1-3) ordering an order amount of parts (1-2)
from a preceding process (1-1) and producing a product (1-4)

to be utilized by a subsequent process (1-5) by using
the parts delivered by the preceding process, the method

comprising the steps of:

detecting (1-6), at a present time, an actually used
amount of parts X1 used in the self-process since the

last ordering from the preceding process;
calculating (1-7) a use plan amount of parts X2 at a
time after the time interval required from the ordering at

the present time until the delivery of the ordered parts
from the preceding process; and
determining (1-8) an order amount of parts Y as the
sum W1•X1 + W2•X2 of the product W1•X1 of the amount

X1 and an actual weight W1 and the product W2•X2 of
the amount X2 and a plan weight W2 (1-9), the sum

W1+W2 of the actual weight and the plan weight being set 
to unity, and W1≠0 and W2≠0.
The method according to claim 1, wherein the actual
weight W1 is determined on the basis of at least one of

the values of the stock capacity (2-5), the stock time (2-6)
and the delivery and use lot amounts (2-1, 2-3).
The method according to claim 1, further comprising the
steps of:


calculating (3-1) a difference index V indicative of
the extent of difference between the actually used amount

X1 and the use plan amount X2 at a time after the time
interval from the ordering at the present time until the

delivery with respect to the time of detection of the
actually used amount as the starting time of calculation;
determining (3-2) an approximate relationship holding
between an influential factor and the difference index; and
determining (3-3) the actual weight W1 according to
the approximate relationship determined in the approximate

relationship determination step.
The method according to claim 3, wherein the influential
factor is at least one of such factors as time required

from the ordering at the present time until the delivery,
parts delivery interval uniformity, delivery and use lot

amounts, actual difference between the actual use and use
plan amounts and label recovery interval uniformity.
The method according to claim 3, further comprising the
steps of:


calculating (3-5) an estimated difference index from
the approximate relationship determined in the approximate

relationship determination step and an influential factor
at the present time;
calculating (3-6) an estimated stock amount from the 
stock amount at the present time, the detected actually

used amount, the past order amount and the estimated
difference index calculated in the estimated difference

index calculation step;
calculating (3-7) an evaluation value (H) from the
estimated stock amount calculated in the estimated stock

amount calculation step and the stock capacity; and

evaluation value calculated in the evaluation value

calculation step.
