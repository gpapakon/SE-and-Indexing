<ABSTRACT>
Encoding and decoding methods for digital video communication apparatus, by which deterioration of the efficiency of 
encoding resulting from the leak estimate is prevented. Range correcting means (3) corrects the range of the data on the preceding 

screen image stored in storage means (1) in accordance with the reference value which is output from reference value output 
means (2). After that, leak coefficient multiplying means (4) outputs a given leak coefficient by multiplication. Then reverse correcting

by the range correcting means (3). Estimated error outputting means (6) measures the difference between the inputted digital image 

data on the current screen and the data reversely corrected by the reverse correcting means (5), and outputs the difference as 
an estimated error difference. Estimated error difference encoding means (7) encodes the estimated error difference outputted 

from the estimated error difference outputting means (6) and outputs the coded error difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital image
communication apparatus, and is applicable to encoding
and decoding systems for a digital image communication
apparatus which transmits and receives signals that are
interframe-encoded using leaky prediction.JP-A-4 092 595 describes an encoding system for a
digital image communication apparatus which effects
interframe encoding using leaky prediction, comprising a
reference value outputting circuit for outputting a
reference value for range correction; a range correcting
circuit for correcting a range with respect to the
digital image data of the preceding frame according to
the reference value outputted by said reference value
outputting circuit; a leak coefficient multiplying
circuit for multiplying the data corrected by said range
correcting circuit by a predetermined leak coefficient
and outputting product data; an uncorrecting circuit for
uncorrecting the data outputted from said leak
coefficient multiplying circuit to restore the range
corrected by said range correcting circuit; a predictive
error outputting circuit for detecting the difference
between inputted digital image data of a present frame
and the data uncorrected by said uncorrecting circuit,
and outputting the detected difference as a predictive 
error; and a predictive error encoding circuit for
encoding the predictive error outputted from said
predictive error outputting circuit in a predetermined
manner and outputting the encoded predictive error.Another similar system is described in EP-A-0490538.Digital transmission of encoded moving-image
television signals having a frequency bandwidth of 4 MHz
generally requires a transmission rate of about 100
Mbit/s. Since a primary bit rate in a multiplex digital
transmission network is of about 1.5 Mbit/s, for example,
it is necessary to encode the above television signals
highly efficiently in order to transmit the encoded
television signals in the multiplex digital transmission
network.A digital image communication apparatus according to
the present invention effects interframe encoding for
encoding only image changes between frames and
transmitting the encoded image information.FIGS. 1(A) and 1(B) of the accompanying drawings are
schematic block diagrams of an overall arrangement of a
conventional digital image communication apparatus. FIG
