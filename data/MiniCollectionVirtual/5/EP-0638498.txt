<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for actuating lateral sheet guides in rotary printing machines in accordance with the sheet format width to be respectively processed, having an actuator, one side stop being able to be displaced transversely to the sheet longitudinal direction, drawing means being guided to the actuator which is arranged visibly and freely accessibly on the operating side of a sheet stack, and actuator and drawing means being positively connected to each other. During actuation of the actuator (36) via drawing means (17, 21, 40) acting together, lateral sheet guides (10, 23, 29) can be simultaneously adjusted in the feeding portion (26) and delivery portion (9), symmetrically with respect to the centre of a printing unit (1).
