<ABSTRACT>
Sensor devices comprising enzyme electrodes incorporating a microporous membrane coated with the carbonaceous material known as "diamond-like carbon" (most conveniently deposited by decomposition of a hydrocarbon, induced by radiation or a high electric field). The membrane material is preferably a polycarbonate and its thickness preferably less than 10 microns, and the coating is preferably 0.01 to 5  mu m thick. The preferred porosity is provided by pores of the order of 0.05 to 0.01 microns. The coated membrane imparts high resistance to fouling by contact with whole blood, extends the linearity of the electrode response over a substantially greater range, e.g. in the analytical determination of glucose in blood, and combines a high degree of restriction to passage of interferents while retaining high permeability to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Most conveniently used for amperometric measurements, especially using a Clark electrode pair, with an "active" anode of platinum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sensor devices, and more
particularly to improved sensor devices useful for analytical
methods in enzyme-based electrode systems, and especially for use
in biological systems.It is known to make and use a variety of sensor devices
which are based on a form of electrode in which the metal
electrode is surrounded by membranes which can exclude
interfering materials from the electrode surface while allowing
substances to be determined by the analytical procedure to reach
the electrode.A common form is that in which the electrode assembly
incorporates an enzyme, which acts on the substrate chemical
being evaluated and generates a different chemical which can be
determined, thus providing means for determining the substrate
chemical indirectly. An especially useful form of this procedure
uses glucose as the substrate and a glucose oxidase enzyme, so
that these interact and -- by catalysed oxidation of the glucose
to gluconic acid -- produce hydrogen peroxide and oxygen as
products. The hydrogen peroxide is very readily and conveniently
determined electrolytically.A problem encountered with such procedures is that the
presence of other materials in the medium being analysed can
interfere with the operation of the sensor device (electrode).
This can occur most markedly with high molecular weight
materials, as in body fluids (e.g. by proteins and the like), but
also can occur when one or more of the components of the
electrolyte system is limited, in concentration or mobility, so
that the signal output of the sensor (electrode) is in turn
limited also. This effect has the most evident effect when it
makes the output signal from the sensor (electrode) non-linear or
reach a limiting value -- as this restricts the range over which
the sensor can be used effectively.It has been proposed to use various materials as membranes,
interposed between the electrode's active working surface and the
medium under analysis, to prevent interfering materials reaching 
the electrode surface and fouling it, while still allowing the
desired moieties to remain mobile and approach the electrode
surface. Although this does produce useful results (controlled
permeability and bio-compatibility), the presence of any barrier
tends to impose some limitations on mobility of the moieties
present, and those barriers hitherto proposed have not yet proved
to be entirely satisfactory.We have now found that the properties of such barriers
around the working surfaces of electrodes in sensor devices,
usually termed
