<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel light duty liquid detergent compositions
with high foaming properties, containing a nonionic surfactant, a specific group of
anionic surfactants, and a Zwitterionic betaine surfactant wherein the surfactants are
dissolved in an aqueous medium.Nonionic surfactants are in general chemically inert and stable toward pH
change and are therefore well suited for mixing and formulation with other materials.
The superior performance of nonionic surfactants on the removal of oily soil is well
recognized. Nonionic surfactants are also known to be mild to human skin. However,
as a class, nonionic surfactants are known to be low or moderate foamers.
Consequently, for detergents which require copious and stable foam, the application
of nonionic surfactants is limited. There have been substantial interest and efforts to
develop a high foaming detergent with nonionic surfactants as the major ingredient.
Little has been achieved.The prior art is replete with light duty liquid detergent compositions containing
nonionic surfactants in combination with anionic and/or betaine surfactants wherein
the nonionic detergent is not the major active surfactant, as shown in U.S. Patent No.
3,658,985 wherein an anionic based shampoo contains a minor amount of a fatty acid
alkanolamide. U.S. Patent No. 3,769,398 discloses a betaine-based shampoo
containing minor amounts of nonionic surfactants. This patent states that the low
foaming properties of nonionic detergents renders its use in shampoo compositions
non-preferred. U.S. Patent No. 4,329,335 also discloses a shampoo containing a
betaine surfactant as the major ingredient and minor amounts of a nonionic surfactant
and of a fatty acid mono- or di-ethanolamide. U.S. Patent No. 4,259,204 discloses a
shampoo comprising 0.8-20% by weight of an anionic phosphoric acid ester and one
additional surfactant which may be either anionic, amphoteric, or nonionic. U.S.
Patent No. 4,329,334 discloses an anionic-amphoteric based shampoo containing a 
major amount of anionic surfactant and lesser amounts of a betaine and nonionic
surfactants.U.S. Patent No. 3,935,129 discloses a liquid cleaning composition based on
the alkali metal silicate content and containing five basic ingredients, namely, urea,
glycerin, triethanolamine, an anionic detergent and a nonionic detergent. The silicate
content determines the amount of anionic and/or nonionic detergent in the liquid
cleaning composition. However, the foaming property of these detergent
compositions is not
