<ABSTRACT>
A non-aqueous metal catalyst comprising iron and at 
least one element chosen from Groups V, VI, or VII, or the 

lanthanides for preparing carbon fibrils, particularly 
carbon fibrils having a morphology consisting of vermicular 

tubes that are free of a continuous thermal carbon overcoat 
and have graphite layers that are substantially parallel to 

the fibril axis and a process for preparing such fibrils.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
Tennent et al., U.S.S.N. 872,215, filed June 6, 1986, 
assigned to the same assignee as the present application 
and hereby incorporated by reference, which is a 
continuation-in-part of Tennent, U.S.S.N. 678,701, now 
issued as U.S. 4,663,230, hereby incorporated by 
reference. Also incorporated by reference are U.S.S.N. 
871,676 and U.S.S.N. 871,675, both of which are 
continuation-in-part applications of Tennent, U.S. 
4,663,230 which were filed on June 6, 1986 and assigned 
to the same assignee as the present application. This invention relates to a non-aqueous metal catalyst to 
be used for the preparation of carbon fibrils. Carbon deposits generally occur in three major 
forms: amorphous, platelet, and vermicular. Carbon 
fibrils are vermicular carbon deposits having diameters 
less than 500 nanometers. These fibrils exist in a 
variety of forms, including filaments (solid core) and 
tubes (hollow core), and have been prepared through the 
catalytic decomposition at metal surfaces of various 
carbon-containing gases. Tennent, U.S. 4,663,230, referred to above, 
describes carbon fibrils that are free of a continuous 
thermal carbon overcoat and have multiple graphitic 
outer layers that are substantially parallel to the 
fibril axis. They are prepared by contacting a 
carbon-containing gas with an iron, cobalt, or 
nickel-containing catalyst at a temperature between 850 
and 1200oC. Object of the present invention is to provide a non-aqueous 
metal catalyst comprising iron and at least one 
element chosen from groups V, VI, or VII or the lanthanides 
for preparing carbon fibrils. This object is solved by a catalyst according to claim 1. The invention features, in one aspect, a non-aqueous  
 
metal catalyst comprising iron and at least one element chosen 
from groups V, VI, or VII of the lanthanides for preparing 
carbon fibrils of the general sort described by Tennent, 
above. The predominant morphology along the length of 
an individual carbon fibril is that of vermicular tube 
free of a continuous thermal carbon (i.e. pyrolytically 
deposited carbon resulting from thermal cracking of the 
gas feed used to prepare the fibrils) overcoat and 
having graphitic layers that are substantially parallel 
to the fibril axis. The total surface area covered by 
the thermal overcoat is preferably less than 50%, more 
preferably 25%, and most preferably less than 5%, and 
the length of the projection of the graphitic layers on 
the fibril axis extends along the
