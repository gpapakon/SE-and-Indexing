<ABSTRACT>
In a ring oscillator type VCO in which plural stages of inverter circuits (10) are 
cascade-connected to each other so as to constitute a positive feedback loop, both of 

delay amounts for a rising edge and a falling edge of an output signal from the inverter 
circuit are controlled to have the same delay amount by way of a control signal (Vc). 

These delay amounts of the rising edge and the falling edge are controllable in such a 
manner that the duty ratio of an oscillator output signal is not varied. Each stage (10) of 

the inverter circuit is arranged by three-staged inverters made of load transistors (Q
L
) 
and driver transistors (Q
D
), and the control voltage (Vc) is applied to the load 
transistors of the two adjoining inverters among the three-staged inverters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a ring oscillator type VCO (voltage-controlled
oscillator). More specifically, the present invention is directed to a ring
oscillator type VCO capable of controlling a phase of an oscillated output signal based
upon a control voltage without varying a duty ratio thereof.As a voltage-controlled oscillator (abbreviated as "VCO"), there is known a
ring oscillator type VCO using inverter blocks as represented in Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B.
In such a ring oscillator type VCO, the odd number-staged inverter circuits are
cascade-connected to each other, thereby constituting the positive feedback loop, and
the control voltage Vc is applied to the inverter circuits at the respective stages. It
should be noted that a capacitor indicates a load capacitance.The Japanese Laid-open patent application No.2-53304 laid open in 1990
discloses such a conventional ring oscillator type VCO constructed of bipolar IC. To
the contrary, another conventional ring oscillator type VCO constructed of MOSIC uses
inverter blocks as generally illustrated in Fig. 1B, and arranged such that each stage of
the inverter circuit is constructed of a single inverter made of the load transistor QL and
the driver transistor QD, and then the control voltage Vc is applied to the load transistor
QL. An oscillator of that type is known from IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 31, no. 2, July 1988, pages 154 to 156.Fig. 2 is a waveform chart for representing an input signal "Vin" and an output
signal "Vout" of one inverter.In the above-explained conventional ring oscillator type VCO using inverter
blocks as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, when the input signal Vin is fallen from the "high"
level into the "low" level, the charging operation to the load capacitance of the next stage
is commenced by the load transistor QL. In connection with this charging operation, the
level of the output voltage Vout is increased with the inclination (namely, increasing
speed) corresponding to the control voltage Vc, and gradually reaches the voltage level
of the power source. Then, this source voltage level of the output signal Vout is
maintained for a moment. Thereafter, this input signal Vin is raised from the "low"
level to the "high" level. Accordingly, the source voltage level (namely high level) of
the output signal Vout is inverted into the low level. It should be understood that
although a certain delay is actually produced between the rising (from LOW to HIGH)
operation of this input signal Vin and the falling operation
