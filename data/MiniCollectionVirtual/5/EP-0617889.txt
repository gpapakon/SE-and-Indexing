<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a herbicidal 
composition. There are very many kinds of weeds to be controlled 
in cultivation fields of gramineous crop plants or in 
lawn fields. They include annual gramineous weeds and 
annual broadleaf weeds as roughly classified. Among 
them, gramineous weeds are difficult to selectively 
control, as gramineous weeds and gramineous crop plants 
are alike, and yet gramineous weeds germinate abundantly. 
Therefore, if gramineous weeds remain, there will be a 
problem that the yield will be poor in such cultivation 
fields. At present, it is common to control gramineous 
weeds by applying a soil-treating agent prior to 
germination of weeds. However, such a method has a 
drawback such that the period for the application is 
rather short. On the other hand, foliage treating agents 
are not many which are useful for controlling gramineous 
weeds, and presently available foliage treating agents 
have such a problem that they are likely to bring about  
 
phytotoxicity to crop plants. Therefore, it has been 
desired to develop an excellent foliage treating agent. 2',3'-Dichloro-4-ethoxymethoxybenzanilide 
(hereinafter referred to as compound 1) is a known 
compound, and it is known as a herbicide for rice fields 
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 73055/1981, 
CA: 79540-50-4 (1979)). On the other hand, 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine 
(hereinafter referred to as 
compound 2) is widely used as a herbicide for corn and 
sorghum and as a herbicide for lawn. Further, 2-(4-chloro-6-ethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino-2-methylpropiononitrile (hereinafter referred to as 
compound 3) is widely used as a herbicide for corn, 
barley, wheat, oats, rye or the like and as a herbicide 
for lawn. At usual doses, compounds 2 and 3 exhibit 
strong herbicidal effects against annual gramineous weeds 
and annual broadleaf weeds as soil treating agents. 
However, in the foliage treatment, they have a drawback 
that their herbicidal effects are weak against annual 
gramineous weeds, although they show strong herbicidal 
effects against annual broadleaf weeds. 4-Hydroxy-3,5-diiodobenzonitrile (hereinafter 
referred to as compound 4) is widely used as a herbicide 
for corn and sorghum, as a herbicide for lawn and as a 
herbicide for barley, wheat, oats, rye or the like. 
Further, 4-octanoyloxy-3,5-dibromo-benzonitrile  
 
(hereinafter referred to as compound 5) is widely used as 
a herbicide for barley, wheat, oats, rye or the like, as 
a herbicide for corn and
