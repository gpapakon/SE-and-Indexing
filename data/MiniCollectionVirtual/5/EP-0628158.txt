<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a laser intensity monitor (10). Specifically the laser intensity monitor (10) uses a black chrome metallic, non-light transmissive mask (24) deposited on an optically transparent glass or sapphire window (16). The mask (24) has an aperture (100) therethrough. The mask (24) is positioned on the window (16) in such a manner that only the TEM00 mode of a counter-rotating laser beam is allowed to pass through the aperture (100) of the mask (24) and the window (16) to strike a photodetector (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 LASER INTENSITY MONITORING APPARATUS WITH METALLIC THIN FILM MASKFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a ring laser gyroscope and more particularly to a laser intensity monitoring apparatus.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONExamples of ring laser gyroscopes are shown and described in U.S. Patent 3,373,650 issued to J. Killpatrick and U.S. Patent 3,390,606 issued to T. Podgorski. An integral part of a ring laser gyro is the laser beam source or generator. One type of laser generator comprises electrodes and a gas discharge cavity in combination with a plurality of mirrors which establishes an optical closed loop path. The gas discharge cavity is generally formed by a laser block having a plurality of interconnecting tunnels or bores.Present day ring laser gyros employ a gas discharge cavity filled with a lasing gas which is ionized when excited by an electric current passing from one electrode to another through the lasing gas. If the plurality of mirrors are properly aligned, two counter-propagating laser beams will be established, traveling in opposite directions along the optical closed loop path. Each counter-propagating laser beam may consist of several light beams sometimes referred to as spatial modes. The centermost mode, commonly referred to as the TEMQQ mode (and also referred to as the fundamental or primary spatial mode), contains the greatest amount of energy and is of greatest value to the operation of the ring laser gyro. One embodiment of a ring laser gyro system includes a device called a path length controller that is capable of making slight alterations to the length of the optical closed loop path by changing the distance between the plurality of mirrors. To ensure that the path length is properly set, a laser intensity monitor is appropriately coupled to the discharge cavity in order to observe the intensity of a portion of one of the counter-propagating laser beams exiting through one of the plurality of mirrors.Desirably, the laser intensity monitor should be sensitive to only the TEMQQ mode of the laser beam exiting the mirror. Based on the intensity of the TEMQQ mode, the path length is regulated so that the TEMQQ mode always contains the maximum amount of energy possible. To achieve this, only the TEMQQ mode of one of the counter-propagating laser beams is monitored. If more than one spatial mode was monitored simultaneously, the ring laser gyro might attempt to adjust the path length so as to maximize the 

energy in a mode other than the TEMQQ mode. This would
