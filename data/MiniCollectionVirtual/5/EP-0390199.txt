<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet 
binding apparatus, more particularly to a ring type sheet binder 
according to the preamble portion of claim 1. In a conventional ring binder in which punched 
sheet materials are bound by a binding ring made of 
plastic resin comprising a spine and a number of 
inwardly curved fingers, the sheet materials are 
punched by a punching means including dies and punches, 
and, thereafter, the sheet materials are taken out of 
the punching means, and the punched sheet materials are 
bound at another place. Since the punched sheet materials are taken 
out of the punching means, and since they are bound at 
another position, the binding operation is time-consuming, 
and some expertise is required to bind the 
sheet materials with the ring member.  
 Further, the document US-A 4 320 547 discloses a sheet 
binding apparatus according to the preamble portion of 
claim 1. This apparatus comprises a punching means for 
punching holes into sheet materials disposed on a 
supporting means, and a conveying means for conveying the 
punched sheet materials to a ring member supported by a 
binding means which is adapted to bind the sheet materials 
by penetrating the ring member through the punched holes, 
wherein the punching means, the binding means and the 
conveying means are controlled by a control means. 
Substantially the same technical teaching can be gathered 
from the document GB-A 0 920 508. Furthermore, the document EP-A 0 120 997 shows a sheet 
binding apparatus having a punching device for punching 
apertures into sheet materials, and a binding device for 
binding the sheet materials between strips with studs 
extending therebetween and through the apertures of the 
sheet materials.  
 It is a principal object of the 
present invention to provide a sheet binding apparatus 
easy to operate. This object is solved by the features indicated in the 
independent claim 1.  
 Advantageously developed embodiments of the invention are 
subject-matters of the dependent claims 2 to 11. The features and 
advantages of the present invention will become more 
apparent upon a consideration of the following 
description of the preferred embodiments of the 
present invention taken in conjunction with the  
 
accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a sectional view of a binding 
apparatus according to a first embodiment. Figures 2A and 2B are flow charts illustrating the 
operation of the apparatus. Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating a

<CLAIMS>
A sheet binding apparatus, comprising a punching means 
(3) for punching holes into sheet materials (2) disposed on 

a supporting means (9), a conveying means (5, 40a, 40b) for 
conveying said punched sheet materials to a ring member (6) 

supported by a binding means (7), said binding means (7) 
being adapted to bind said sheet materials (2) by 

penetrating said ring member (6) through said punched 
holes, wherein said punching means (3), said binding means 

(7) and said conveying means (5, 40a, 40b) are controlled 
by a control means (79, 185), 
characterized by
 an improper 
conveyance detecting means (85, 86, 87) for detecting 

improper conveyance of said sheet materials (2) by said 
conveying means (5, 40a, 40b) along the conveyance path, 

wherein said control means (79, 185) is adapted to prohibit 
a normal operation of said sheet binding apparatus on the 

basis of said detection.
