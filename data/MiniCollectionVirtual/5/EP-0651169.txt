<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a method of preventing 
wear, and more particularly to a method of preventing 
fretting and galling in a metallic coupling, such as but 
not limited to a polygon coupling. Polygon shaft couplings are generally known. For example, 
this type shaft coupling is described in US-A-4,294,562. 
Typically, in such couplings, a shaft and a hub have cross 
sections fitting into each other, and these cross sections 
deviate from a circular pattern and have shapes that are 
convex on all sides and essentially elliptical, triangular 
or quadratic. In use of this type polygon coupling in centrifugal 
compressor design, an impeller of a centrifugal compressor 
is operatively connected to a centrifugal compressor 
driving shaft or pinion. In such a design, the compressor 
impeller includes a polygonally dimensioned male hub 
portion, and the compressor pinion includes a suitably 
dimensioned bore which receives the male hub portion of the 
compressor impeller. Although this type polygon coupling 
has been used with success in centrifugal compressor 
design, this polygon coupling is susceptible to galling and 
fretting. More particularly, galling has been known to 
occur between the two mating polygon surfaces of the hub 
portion of the impeller and the interior wall of the 
polygonally dimensioned bore of the pinion. Additionally, 
fretting has been known to occur at an annular shoulder 
region between the pinion and the impeller. As used herein, galling means a type of adhesive wear which 
is caused by an imbalance of electrons existing between two  
 
mating metal surfaces. In this regard, when material is 
subject to galling under low stresses, minute junctions 
form at contacting surfaces and small fragments of the 
metals become detached with subsequent movement. When 
material is subject to galling under high stresses, large 
junctions are formed, or actual seizure may occur between 
the materials. In a polygon coupling of the type described 
hereinabove, there generally exists high stresses between 
the impeller and the pinion. When galling occurs between 
the impeller and the pinion, the impeller may become 
difficult to remove from the pinion. In cases when the 
impeller actually seizes on the pinion, the impeller must 
be cut therefrom to perform any required maintenance or 
compressor servicing. As used herein, fretting means surface damage caused by low 
amplitude, but high frequency sliding between two 
contacting surfaces. In the polygon shaft coupling between 
the
