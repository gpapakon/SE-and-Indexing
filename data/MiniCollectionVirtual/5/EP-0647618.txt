<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to new non-ionic hexaiodinated 
dimeric compounds, derived from dicarbamoyl triiodoisophthalic 
acid, which contain in their molecule a 3 - azapentanediamide 
acid bridge and can be used as X-ray contrast 
agents, and are of the general formula I 
 
wherein 
R1 and R7, whether the same or different, are polyhydroxyalkyl 
radicals, linear or branched, from C2 to C4, 
with one to three OH groups; R2 and R6, whether the same or different, are hydrogen, 
methyl or 2 - hydroxy-ethyl; R3 and R5, whether the same or different, are hydrogen 
or methyl; R4 is hydrogen, methyl, methoxymethyl or a polyhydroxyalkyl 
radical, linear or branched, from C2 to C4, with one 
to three OH groups. The present invention also includes the possible enantiomers, 
diastereomers and/or rotomers of the compounds with 
the general formula I. The present invention also describes a process for the 
preparation of these compounds, as well as the galenical  
 
compositions containing them, for their use as contrast 
agents for X-ray diagnostic. The new compounds of the general formula I are capable 
of replacing the classic salts of 2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid 
as well as the non-ionic monomers as radio - opaque media in 
radiology, due to their higher level of tolerance and lower 
incidence of undesirable side-effects. This kind of compounds 
have practically the same iodine content, but their aqueous 
solutions show a lower osmotic pressure, which is a known 
cause of significant disadvantages such as pain and sensation 
of heat after injection, nausea, migraine, etc. Due to 
the low tonicity of their solutions, when these compounds are 
administered via subarachnoid, in myelography and cisternography, 
they do not cause, in contrast to conventional compounds, 
arachnoiditis or epileptogenic disorders. Although the tolerance of the non-ionic monomers is 
considerably better than that of the salts of 2,4,6-triiodobenzoic 
acid, aqueous solutions of them at concentrations 
suitable for diagnosis are still too hypertonic for the blood 
or cephalorachidian fluid. This has led to look for new non-ionic bicyclic 
hexaiodinated compounds (non-ionic dimers), of a reduced 
osmolality, thus obtaining hypotonic solutions with blood, 
at concentrations of iodine which are of diagnostic value. 
Non-ionic iodinated compounds having a dimer structure are 
described in EP-A-0 108 638, EP-A-0 317 492 and EP-A-0 308 364. These solutions in general, however, have the disadvantage 
of being more viscous than those of ionic
