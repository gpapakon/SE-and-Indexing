<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a head-treatment 
composition containing a special plant extract and 
superior in the effects of prevention of hair loss, 
promotion of hair growth, etc. in mammals. In the past, there have been known hair tonic 
compositions containing various types of medicines. For 
example, vitamins such as vitamin E, amino acids such as 
methionine, vascodilators such as acetylcholine 
derivatives, anti-inflammation agents such as extract of 
Shikon (Lithospermiradix; root of Lithospermum 
officinale L. subsp. erythrorhizom Hand.-Mazz.) female 
hormones such as estradiol, skin function promotors such 
as cepharanthine, etc. have been formulated in and used 
for the prevention and treatment of hair loss. As those 
using plant components which can be compared with the 
present invention, there have been publicized the use of 
crushed seeds of AnonaSquamosa L. dispersed in, for 
example, sesame oil for promoting hair growth (see West 
German Patent Specification No. 3614448). This plant is 
probably more accurately AnnonaSquamosa L. The seeds per 
se, however, are known to exhibit toxicity and therefore, 
there seems to be a problem for practical use. Further, conventional hair tonic compositions are 
considered to be effective for prevention and improvement 
of, for example, dandruff, ichiness, hair loss, and to 
promote hair growth and hair health, but none has been 
obtained which exhibits satisfactory effects. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
head-treatment composition which is effective for the 
prevention of hair loss, is effective for hair growth, 
etc. and is superior in safety. The present inventors have heretofore engaged in 
intensive studies on the efficacy of various types of 
plant components in preventing hair loss and promoting 
hair growth and found that extracts derived from plants 
belonging to the family Annonaceae exhibited the above-mentioned 
efficacy and were superior in safety. Thus, 
the present invention has been completed. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a head-treatment composition comprising an 
extract derived from at least one plant belonging to the 
family Annonaceae. More specifically, there is provided a head-treatment 
composition comprising an extract derived from 
one or more plants selected from the group consisting of 
plants belonging to genuses of the family Annonaceae such 
as the Annona L., Anomianthus Sincl., Ellipeiopsis R.E. 
Fries, Artabotrys R. Br., Melodorum Griff., and 
Goniothalamus
