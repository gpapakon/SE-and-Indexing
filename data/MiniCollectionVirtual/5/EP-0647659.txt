<ABSTRACT>
An oxidized polymer solution is produced by oxidizing a saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer in 
solution in a solvent mixture comprising water and an alcohol in the presence of a salt of a multivalent metal. A 

laminate is produced by coating a base material such as a polymer film with the polymer solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing an oxidation-treated polymer solution comprising 
oxidizing a saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate 
copolymer (hereinafter sometime referred to briefly as 
EVOH) in a solution form and a method for producing a 
laminate having an oxygen-barrier property which 
comprises coating the surface of a substrate, such as a 
plastic substrate, with the oxidation-treated polymer 
solution. The film obtainable from EVOH is transparent and 
excellent in oxygen-barrier property and, therefore, 
laminates of EVOH film with other plastic film, paper, 
metal foil, etc. are useful packing materials for 
foodstuffs, pharmaceutical products, industrial chemicals 
and so on. Any desired technique available can be employed 
for forming an EVOH film on a substrate but the solution 
coating method comprising coating the surface of a 
substrate with a solvent solution of EVOH is attracting  
 
attention because a comparatively thick film can be 
formed, the film can be easily formed even on a substrate 
having a complicated profile, such as a hollow 
vessel, and the coating can be performed with a comparatively 
simple apparatus. However, a solution obtainable by dissolving the 
ordinary EVOH in a solvent mixture of water and alcohol 
has a poor storage stability, i.e. a short pot life, 
and when stored at room temperature, becomes opacified 
in a few days and ultimately solidifies. Therefore, it 
is poor in handlability, requiring a field operation, 
such as redissolving EVOH by heating the solution at 
60-80°C for a few hours, for instance, immediately 
before use. Furthermore, this EVOH solution is so high 
in viscosity that it is inferior in high-speed coatability. For improving the stability of an EVOH solution, a 
method comprising adding boric acid to EVOH has been 
proposed (Kokai Tokkyo Koho H-2-47144) but even with 
such contrivances the storage stability cannot be said 
to be sufficient. Moreover, because of the high 
viscosity, the high-speed coatability is not improved 
at all. Thus, the conventional ordinary EVOH solution or 
the solution prepared by adding boric acid thereto is  
 
unsuitable as a coating. Kokai Tokkyo Koho H-4-500834 describes the use, in 
a polymer composition for the production of a 
biodegradable plastic product made up of a modified 
starch and a synthetic polymer comprising EVOH or 
polyvinyl alcohol, of a polymer oxidized by reaction 
with hydrogen peroxide and persulfuric acid as said 
polymer. However, when EVOH is dissolved in a
