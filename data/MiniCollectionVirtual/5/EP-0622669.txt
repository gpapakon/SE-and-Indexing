<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of electronic processing an 
image-wise exposed photographic material comprising at least one light-sensitive 

silver halide emulsion layer said method comprising the steps of: 

(1) placing said exposed photographic material between the electrodes of 
a capacitor connected to an amplifier, 
(2) scanning said material by means of at least one radiation beam, which 
scanning generates an electrical signal between said capacitor electrodes, 
(3) amplifying the electrical signal coming from said capacitor electrodes, 
(4) converting the amplified signal into a digital signal, 
(5) storing the digital signal into a recording apparatus. 
The apparatus for performing the above method is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for electronic development of
conventional silver halide photographic materials, in particular black-and-white and
color photographic materials and to the apparatus for performing such a process.
More specifically, the present invention provides an apparatus which is able to
discriminate the formation of latent image, in an image-wise exposed silver halide
photographic material, by means of measurements of the Dember effect of the
silver halide grain emulsion.The latent image in a silver halide crystal is formed by exposure of the
crystal to an electromagnetic radiation to which the crystal is sensitive or is
sensitized. The energy of the electromagnetic radiation promotes the formation of
an electron-hole pair having different mobilities in the grain. The combination of a
photoelectron with a interstitial silver ion forms the silver speck responsible for the
latent image cluster. A more detailed description of the mechanism of formation of
the latent image can be found in T.H.James, "The Theory of the Photographic
Process", Fourth Edition, pp. 105-132, Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York.Several literature references relate to the measurement of
photoconductivity of emulsion coatings to correlate the observations with
sensitometric properties, spectral sensitization, and the latent image formation
mechanism.Measurements of photoconductivity can be performed by means of
microwave radiations, as described, for example, in L.M.Kellog et al. Photographic
Science Engineering, Vol. 16, p. 115 (1972), J.Beutel, Photographic Science
Engineering, Vol. 19, p. 95 (1975), and T.Taneda, Journal of Imaging Science, Vol.
33, p. 115 (1989). A method for detecting latent image formation in silver halide
using microwave photoconductivity has been described by A.Hasegawa and
T.Sakaguchi, Journal of Imaging Science, Vol. 30, p. 13. However, such a method
is not sufficiently sensitive to detect low exposure levels. Kellog et al. in US 4,788,131 describe a technique to detect the presence
of latent image by using a radiofrequency photoconductivity apparatus. This
method is more sensitive, but needs a cooling stage to have reproducible results.Levine in US 4,777,102 and 4,751,583 describes a method and an
apparatus for electronic development of photographic films by applying a laser
beam to an image-wise exposed photographic material. Each portion of the
pre-exposed photographic material absorbs a different amount of light energy
according to the extent of the latent image formed
