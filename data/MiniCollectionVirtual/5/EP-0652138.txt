<ABSTRACT>
A blow molding bumper beam which has a high strength, can accomplish a 
lightening, and pass 5 miles / hour pole test and whose longitudinal length is longer than a 

space between fitting members on the bumper beam and whose dimension along a 
longitudinal axis of an automobile is almost the same length as that of a reinforcing member, 

which is inserted into the bumper beam main body, with which surroundings of the 
reinforcing member are covered. Because of the above construction, the strengt
h of the 
bumper beam 1 is improved and the lightening can be accomplished without thickening a 

wall thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bumper beam obtained by a blow molding method and
this is particularly used for a rear bumper beam of an automobile and others.A bumper beam made from metal like mainly steel and others had been used for
the bumper beam of an automobile, however lightening and corrosion prevention are
difficult for the steel and others and therefore a plastic bumper beam has been used recently.
A construction which accomplishes the lightening and an improvement of a strength is
required in this plastic bumper beam and the applicant has already proposed the bumper
beam described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 4-120145, Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 4-126755 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. 5-92744
as the bumper beam which can be molded easily and integrally by a blow molding
with a rib construction (a cross sectional construction) improving the strength without an
increase of a weight like thickening a wall thickness.The bumper beam 60 the applicant proposed is shown in Fig. 8. The bumper
beam 60 consists of only a bumper beam body 64 of sectionally C-shape whose front side
edge (a face against an automobile fitting face when the bumper beam is attached to the
automobile) of an upper frame portion 61 and a lower frame portion 62 which have a
hollow portion inside are connected by a side edge portion. This bumper beam 60 was
provided with the sufficient strength for a front bumper beam of the automobile, but when
it was used for a rear bumper beam which required more strength than the front, the
strength needed to be improved by thickening the wall thickness of the bumper beam 60,
whereby a problem of increasing the weight occurred. In order to meet the demand of the
safety, the rear bumper beam was required to pass a strict test, that is 5 miles / hour pole
test (a deformation quantity of the bumper beam is measured when the automobile with the
bumper beam collided with a metal pole by 5 miles / hour) and there was a problem to
make a big increase of the weight in order that the bumper beam 60 passed this test.On the other hand, the bumper beam whose strength was improved by inserting
a reinforcing member of the same material as the bumper beam body into the bumper beam
body obtained by the blow molding method was described in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open No. 5-445 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2-299948. A conventional bumper beam 70 into which a reinforcing
member 72 as shown in Fig. 9 was inserted was short of the
strength to
