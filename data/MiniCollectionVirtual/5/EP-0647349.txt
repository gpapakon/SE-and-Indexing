<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing capacitor grade powder, electrodes, and finished capacitors therefrom having reduced electrical leakage characteristics. The powder is prepared by reacting Group V-B base materials with quantities of between 500 to 7000 ppm of nitrogen and 700 to 3000 ppm of oxygen. Electrical leakage is reduced by at least 28 % for electrodes anodized at 100 volts or greater in comparison with electrodes and finished capacitors made from undoped materials. A range of specific charge of up to 25,000 uFV/g is achieved for sintering temperatures of 1400  DEG C to 1800  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing capacitor 
grade powder from a base material selected from Group V-B of 
the Periodic Table which has been reacted with nitrogen and 
oxygen; the powder produced therefrom; and a solid electrode 
fabricated from the powder and anodized at voltages of 100 
volts and higher. Improved electrical leakage characteristics 
are obtained through a range of specific charge of up to 
25,000 uFV/g. The performance characteristics of capacitors or 
electrodes formed from capacitor grade powders are expressed 
in terms of specific charge and electrical current leakage. 
The specific charge, normally expressed in uFV/g, is a measure 
of electrical charge capacity of the capacitor and is usually 
proportional to the surface area of the powder as a sintered 
and anodized pellet. The electrical leakage, normally 
expressed in units of nA/uFV or 10-3 uA/uFV, is an indication 
of how well the capacitor holds the specific charge. 
Capacitors with improved electrical leakage characteristics 
are recognized as having higher reliability. It is well known that the performance characteristics of 
finished capacitors are affected by the chemical and physical 
characteristics of the powder employed to make the capacitors. 
Base powders having greater than 3000 ppm by weight of oxygen 
often develop crystalline like flaws in the dielectric film 
during sintering and anodic oxidation. The flaws allow 
current to pass through the dielectric, producing parts which 
exhibit excessive electrical leakage and premature failure. 
The likelihood of flaw formation increases for high 
reliability capacitors where anodization voltages of 100 volts 
or higher are used.  
 Various attempts have been made to improve the 
performance characteristics of finished capacitors by reacting 
small quantities of modifying agents to the base material 
powders. A range of additives or "dopants" have been used 
including nitrogen, silicon, phosphorous, boron, carbon and 
sulfur. One example of such prior attempts is found in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,154,609 which discloses the addition of an 
inorganic lubricant such as boron nitride to tantalum metal 
powder prior to sintering at 1600°C. A sintering temperature 
range of between 1,550°C and 1,850°C is disclosed. Electrical 
testing of sintered and anodized pellets resulted in a 
decrease in average electrical leakage values in a range of 
between 0.15 to 0.26 nA/uFV. This represents a decrease in 
electrical leakage of between about 4% to 38% with respect to 
undo
