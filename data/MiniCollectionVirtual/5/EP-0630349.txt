<ABSTRACT>
A safety keg assembly includes a keg (1) having a keg neck (3) and a keg spear valve (5) releasably fitted in the keg neck (3). The spear valve (5) has at least one outwardly projecting locking element (7) which co-operates with the keg neck (3). Once the keg spear valve (5) is inserted into the keg neck (3), the locking element (7) prevents the spear valve (5) from being blown out by residual pressure by engaging a shoulder (8) on the keg neck (3). The assembly and disassembly of the spear valve (5) and the keg neck (3) is by means of a slot (11) in the shoulder (8) of the keg neck (3) through which the locking element (7) can pass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a safety keg 
assembly including a keg and a safety spear valve 
and also to a safety spear valve. A beer keg is usually a substantially 
cylindrical drum having a mouth at one end which 
is closed by a spear valve assembly providing 
access to beer in the keg via a tapping head. The 
spear valve assembly usually comprises a beer 
valve located in the keg neck which includes a 
valve body and a valve housing, and a downtube 
connected to the valve body which extends into the 
keg. On site, a tapping head is connected to the 
spear valve providing pressure in the form of CO2, 
allowing the beer to be supplied under pressure to 
a dispensing tap at the bar. We have found that problems can occur when 
the spear valve is being removed from the keg if 
there is residual CO2 pressure within the keg. If 
this gas is not evacuated prior to an attempt to 
open the keg, it can result in the spear valve 
being blown out of the keg by the residual gas. 
This is, of course, very dangerous and likely to 
cause injury, particularly in the event of 
unauthorized or unskilled attempts at removal of 
the spear valve. This problem has been addressed before, for 
example, in GB-2188040 where a projection is 
provided on the valve assembly which engages  
 
against the inside of the keg neck in the event of a release under 
pressure. In that design, however, there is an awkward assembly arrangement 
whereby the valve housing and valve body must be coupled together 
after the valve body with the downtube thereon has been inserted 
through the keg neck. US4509663 (Fallon) discloses an assembly according to the 
preamble of claims 1 and 6, wherein a keg neck has a blind receiving 
groove for a lug that extends from a collar for securing a spear 
valve in the keg neck. The lug keys into the groove which comprises 
an upper and lower vertical section at each end of a horizontal 
section. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved safety 
keg assembly reducing the risk of a spear valve assembly being 
accidentally ejected by residual pressure. According to the present 
invention, there is provided a safety keg assembly comprising a keg 
having a keg neck, and a keg spear valve assembly releasably fitted 
in the keg neck, the keg neck having at least one abutment surface 
having a slot therethrough and the spear valve assembly including 
a plurality of locking elements axially and circumferentially spaced 
relative to one another and dimensional to pass through the slot 
whereby the keg

<CLAIMS>
A safety keg assembly comprising a keg (1) having a keg 
neck (3), and a keg spear valve assembly (5) releasably fitted in 

the keg neck,the keg neck having at least one abutment surface (8) 
having a slot (11) and the spear valve assembly including a 

plurality of locking elements (7), characterised in that the slot 
passes through the abutment surface and the locking elements are 

axially and circumferentially spaced relative to one another and 
dimensioned to pass through the slot (11) whereby the keg neck and 

spear valve assembly co-operate together to prevent the spear valve 
from being blown out by residual pressure in the keg. 
A safety keg assembly according to claim 1, wherein the 
abutment surface (8) on the keg neck comprises an annular shoulder 

on the neck. 
A safety keg assembly according to claim 1 or 2, 
comprising two locking elements (7) axially spaced and 

circumferentially spaced to one another. 
A safety keg assembly according to claim 1, wherein the 
keg neck (3) includes a plurality of arcuate shoulders axially 

spaced relative to one another to form one or more channels 
therebetween each shoulder being arranged to provide a passage 

through which the or each locking element can pass, the passages 
being angularly displaced.  

 
A safety keg assembly according to claim 4, wherein the 
passages are slots in the shoulders. 
A safety keg assembly comprising a keg (1) having a keg 
neck (3) presenting a shoulder (8),
 
   and a spear valve (5) releasably fitted in the keg neck, 

the spear valve having a plurality of locking elements (7) located 
on and extending outwardly therefrom, characterised by the locking 

elements being axially and circumferentially spaced relative to one 
another and being arranged such that, once the keg spear valve is 

inserted into the keg neck, the locking elements will prevent the 
spear valve from being blown out by residual pressure by engaging 

a shoulder on the keg neck, the assembly and disassembly of the 
spear valve and the keg neck being facilitated by a slot (11) in the 

shoulder (8) of the keg neck through which the locking elements can 

pass. 
A spear valve (5) for a safety keg assembly according to 
any one of claims 1 to 6, comprising a plurality of locking elements 

(7) extending outwardly therefrom and being axially and 
circumferentially spaced relative to one another.
