<ABSTRACT>
A control system for an automatic transmission, 
which can easily achieve a variety of shift patterns 

according to the taste of a driver and the situations 
of a running road. The control system comprises: a 

neural network; and a mode switch means for switching 
a teaching mode and an automatic mode. The neural 

network learns in the teaching mode and neuro-computes 
to output a gear ratio in the automatic mode. Further 

comprised are: tolerance error compute means for computing 
a tolerance error on the basis of at least one 

of th propriety of a teaching gear ratio, the ambiguity 
of an input value and the ambiguity of the teaching 

gear ratio; pattern produce means for producing a 
learning pattern; and combined load correct means for 

correcting the coupled loads of the neural network on 
the basis of the pattern produce means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system 
for an automatic transmission. In the prior art, a control system for an automatic 
transmission for a vehicle has its vehicle speed 
and throttle opening detected so that a corresponding 
gear stage may be selected. In this kind of automatic 
transmission, however, a shift is always made in the 
same shift pattern so that it cannot match the taste 
of the driver. Still the worse, the shift can not 
match the situations of the running road in case the 
vehicle is to run on a road surface having a changing 
friction coefficient or in a mountainous district. Thus, there has been proposed a control system 
for an automatic transmission, which can have its 
shift changed by the shifting operation with a shift 
pattern according to the taste of the driver or the  
 
situations of the running road (as disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. 261745/1987). In this case, the automatic transmission is equipped 
with a manual shift lever so that a shift is 
executed at a predetermined shift point while the vehicle 
is running with the manual shift. Moreover, the 
control system of the automatic transmission reads the 
data of the vehicle speed and the throttle opening 
compares these data and the data of the fundamental 
shift pattern to compute a constant of proportion so 
that it corrects the fundamental shift pattern with 
the constant of proportion. If, therefore, the shifting 
operation is actually performed according to the 
taste of the driver or the situations of the running 
road, it is possible to establish a shift pattern according 
to the shifting operation. Thus, there has been proposed a control system 
for an automatic transmission, which corrects the 
shift pattern by dialogues (as disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. 134451/1990). In this case, the control system of the automatic 
transmission corrects the shift pattern by holding 
dialogues with the driver to draw the fuzzy inference. 
Specifically, the control system of the automatic 
transmission corrects the shift pattern by drawing the  
 
fuzzy inference on the basis of the qualitative answer 
obtained from the dialogues with the driver, by computing 
a correction coefficient from the fuzzy inference, 
and by multiplying the vehicle speed, the 
shift of which is to be decided, by the correction 
coefficient. In the control system for the automatic transmission 
of the prior art, in which the shift pattern is 
produced by the shifting operation, the fundamental 
shift pattern is
