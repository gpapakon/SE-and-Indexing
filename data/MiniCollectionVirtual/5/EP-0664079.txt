<ABSTRACT>
The system is controlled by a CPU to generate preset patterns of signal with characteristic signal length, group-lengths and shapes to drive a piezo-electric transducer (20) at programmed US sound patterns. The patterns are varied to apply to different pests and to suit the conditions e.g. different parts of the breeding year. The signal characteristics are produced by a programmed control (14) and are changed to an analogue pattern by the CPU. This is used to drive the piezo output stage via a fast op-amp (15) and a frequency filter (19). Two parallel piezo-electric transducers are used set at an angle of 20 degrees to each other. The circular piezo wafers are provided with cones of waterproof, oxide coated paper with oval openings. The system has an automatic reset on failure of the power supply.

A device for repelling pests by emiting an
ultrasonic signal the structure of which is made of

isolated tone sequences which includes :

a program piloted microprocessor to calculate
the ultrasonic signal with a randomised selection of

the predetermined parameters of the signal taken into
account such as the frequency of sound and the lengths

of pauses between the different tone sequences
a digital/analog transducer
an analog amplifier
one ultrasonic piezo-electric tweeter at least
a programmed device for resetting
an operational control device by transmission of
the ultrasonic signal towards the human auditory area,

   characterised in that
additional parameters of the ultrasonic signal are
predetermined by range of values, i.e. : tone length

(TL), each duration of sound sequence (SL), the
"structure" parameter (SP) which can be obtained by

calculating the difference between the maximum and the
minimum sound duration within a tone sequence and the

random mode,
the predetermination of the range of the signal
parameters is made possible thanks to the transmission

of user's instructions to a programmable switching unit
(14);
the ultrasonic signal (US) calculated by the
microprocessor (3) is transformed within the program

into a rectangular output signal directly sent towards
the analog amplifier (15); 
the analog amplifier has a quick operational
amplifier (31) which drives the bases of the two

additional transistors (33,34) in a loop emitting
circuit;
a frequency filter (19) is put in between the
analog amplifier (15) and the ultrasonic piezo-electric

tweeter (20,40);
the ultrasonic piezo-electric tweeter (20,40)
which plays the role of an oscillating system, is made

of a piezo-ceramic thickness oscillator which has the
shape of a circular piezo disc (42) with a cone (43)

having the shape of a funnel stuck on the upper central
part and made of a sealing material plated with an

oxide film with a d1 diameter neck opening (44) ranged
between 2 to 4 mm, a cone orifice (46) of a d2 diameter

ranged between 10 to 14 mm, and an envelop (45) of a L

length ranged between 5 to 7 mm.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 or 2

characterised in that the orifice (46) of the cone (43)
is nearly oval.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 or 2

characterised in that the oscillating system (41) is
suspended in an low-muffled mode in a circular housing

(50) thanks to sticking points (47,48) on the bottom
plate of the housing.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the output signal of the analog
amplifier (15) is sent to the ultrasonic piezo-electric

tweeters (20,40) arranged at a horizontal level and
oriented with an aperture angle of about 20°.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4
 
characterised in that the program reset device (13)

automatically reacts to any disturbance at the power
supply level for the microprocessor (3).
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5

characterised in that the control device can be
activated by the program and the transmission of the

signal is automatically stopped after a predetermined
delay.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6

characterised in that the control device shows an
optical control means.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7

characterised in that the device (1) is fixed as a
centralised station in a housing protected by a

metallic front grid slightly curved, an integrated
clamping bow, output side connectors and a power plug

bent at a backwards angle.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8

characterised in that the device supplies other
ultrasonic piezo-electric tweeters (20,40) included in

separated housings and far from the centralised
station, the said satellites offering a housing

conception similar to the centralised housing.
Installation made of at least two devices as
claimed in any of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that the different ultrasonic US
signals can be desynchronized one against the other

thanks to a program piloted reset device triggering 
after a while the randomised selection of the signal

parameters.
Installation as claimed in claim 10,

characterised in that the desynchronization degree D is
adjustable as from the programmable switching unit

(14).
