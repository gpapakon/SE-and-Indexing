<ABSTRACT>
A method of assembling a speaker having first (10) 
and second (28, 30) components comprises coating at least 

selected areas of the first component (10) with a heat 
sensitive coating (12), applying heat (36, 38) to at least one 

of the first (10) and second (28, 30) components in areas 
where the first (10) and second (28, 30) components are to be 

assembled to activate the heat sensitive coating (12) and 
bringing the first (10) and second (28, 30) components into 

contact while the heat sensitive coating (12) is activated to 
assemble them (10, 28, 38) together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in the
construction of transducers. It is disclosed in the
context of loudspeakers, but is believed to be useful in
other applications as well.Presently, metal speaker frames are plated or
painted before the assembly of the moving loudspeaker
components, diaphragm and voice coil, surround, and spider,
into them. Then the moving components are added,
illustratively by attaching them using adhesives. The
painting and plating processes are not as environmentally
friendly as other protective coating or treating
techniques. Typically the adhesives used in the assembly
of speakers also contain solvents, the release of which
during adhesive curing raises environmental concerns as
well. Additionally, the application and curing of
adhesives to couple the speaker frames and moving
components requires additional process steps which have
attendant process tolerances and failure rates. For
example, a speaker frame to which adhesive has been applied
may have to be set aside for a period of time until the
adhesive reaches the appropriate tackiness for subsequent
process steps to be conducted. This results in additional
work in process.Additionally, the adhesives are difficult to apply
completely uniformly around surfaces requiring them,
resulting in thicker applications of adhesive at some
places and thinner applications at others. Of course, in
order to assure at least a minimum application of adhesive
at any point around the frame, excess adhesive results at
other locations around the frame. This means not only 
waste in the excess amount of adhesive added to the other
locations around the frame, but also complications in the
curing of the excess adhesive, possible interference of the
excess adhesive with the proper orientation and/or operation
of the assembled speaker, and the excess volatile components
of the excess adhesive needing to be dealt with
environmentally during the curing process. Excess adhesive
can also result in adhesive "squeeze out" rejection of
assembled speakers, notably in the coupling of the surround
or compliance to the frame. Non-uniform application of
adhesive to the frame can affect system alignment and
contribute to so-called "rub-buzz" rejection of assembled
speakers.Examples of coating with an adhesive are to be
found in the disclosures of JP-A-04-151999 and JP-A-57-020095.According to the present invention there is
provided a speaker having a speaker frame for supporting
moving components of the speaker, the moving components
including a diaphragm
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of assembling a speaker having a speaker
frame for supporting moving components of the speaker, the

moving components including a diaphragm and at least one of
a surround and a spider for connecting the diaphragm to the

frame, and the method comprising the steps of applying a
fluent heat sensitive thermoplastic powder coating over

substantially the entire surface of the frame, assembling the at least one of the surround and spider to the frame, applying heat
to the frame to fuse the thermoplastic powder on the frame,

assembling and applying heat to the thermoplastic powder in
areas where the at least one of the surround and spider is

to be coupled to the frame to activate the thermoplastic
powder and couple the at least one of the surround and

spider to the thermoplastic powder in those areas.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of fusing
the thermoplastic powder on the frame comprises the step of

applying heat to the frame.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of
applying heat to the thermoplastic powder coating in areas

where the at least one of the surround and spider is to be
coupled to the frame comprises the step of contacting the at

least one of the surround and spider with a heat staking
iron for a time and with a force sufficient to activate the

thermoplastic powder coating in those areas where the at
least one of the surround and spider is to be coupled to the

frame.
The method of claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein the step
of assembling the at least one of the surround and spider to

the frame comprises the step of assembling a terminal board
to the frame. 
The method of claim 4, wherein the step of
applying heat in areas where the at least one of the

surround and spider is to be coupled to the frame comprises
the step of applying heat to the perimeter of the at least

one of the spider and surround to couple the perimeter of
the at least one of the spider and surround to the frame.
The method of according to any preceding claim,
wherein the step of applying a thermoplastic powder coating

to the frame comprises the step of applying a corrosion-inhibiting
thermoplastic powder coating to the frame.
