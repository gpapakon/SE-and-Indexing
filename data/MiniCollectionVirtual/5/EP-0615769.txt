<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses a vessel stent which is inserted into a vessel such as a blood vessel and retains the shape of the vessel, 
and a vessel stent insertion device. The vessel stent consists of filaments of continuous in-vivo absorbable polymer fiber, and 

the filaments are so shaped as to extend in zigzag along the peripheral surface of a cylindrical member, a tubular member, etc. 
Examples of the in-vivo absorbable polymer are polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyglactin, polydioxanone, polyglyconate, 

and copolymers between the polyglycolic acid or polylactic acid and ε-caprolactone. The vessel stent insertion device puts the vessel 
stent over a balloon formation portion near the distal end of a catheter and bonds it by a biocompatible material such as the 

biodegradable polymer (e.g. polylactic acid), water-soluble protein, fibrin paste.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a luminal stent adapted to be
inserted into the vessel, such as a blood vessel, lymph vessel,
bile duct vessel, ureter vessel or esophagus for maintaining the
shape of the vessel. More particularly, it relates to a luminal
stent inserting device for inserting the luminal stent to a
desired site in the vessel.As this type of the luminal stent, there is known a textile
structure in which linear longitudinal and transversal materials
of stainless steel or the like are woven or knitted in a tube,
and which may be enlarged and fitted to a site of an
vasculogenetic operation.However, this known type of the luminal stent suffers from
the problem that it is harder and likely to apply the stress to
the vessel to produce inflammation or excess hypertrophy
susceptible to re-constriction in the vessel, and that the stent
is left semi-permanently as a foreign matter in the living body
which by nature acts to dispel such foreign matter.If the luminal stent, such as a metal stent, which is left
in the vessel semi-permanently or for a period longer than is
necessary, is inserted into the vessel, it tends to act as a kind
of a nucleus around which re-constriction is likely to occur in 
the vessel. In addition, if a part of the vessel in the vicinity of
the stent is injured, there is a risk that the cells on the inner
wall of the vessel increase in number due to multiplication to reduce
the inner diameter of the vessel.In EP 0 282 175 A1 an expandable stent comprising a wire
formed into a certain serpentine configuration formed into a
cylindrical shape is disclosed. The wire is preferably made of a
malleable material such as annealed stainless steel, tungsten or
platinum. In WO 91/17789 a stent made of bioabsorbable
material woven into a diamond-braided pattern is disclosed.
Metal stents or woven textile stents, however, have the disadvantage
that their trackability upon passage through meandering
vessels is unsatisfactory.Document EP-A-0 357 003 discloses a stent which is formed
of a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer wire. This wire
forms an undulating length of a generally sinusiodal character,
that length being wound in a generally helical manner. It is an object of the present invention to provide a luminal
stent which is less susceptible to re-constriction in the vessel or
reduction in the inner vessel diameter, a method for producing
such luminal stent, and a combination for applying the luminal
stent.To solve this object, the present invention provides a luminal
stent as described
