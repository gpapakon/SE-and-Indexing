<ABSTRACT>
This heat exchanger (1), including elements contaminated by radiation, comprises a water (header) box (2) divided by a wall (3) into two partial water boxes (2A, 2B), each of which is connected to a cooling water circuit via a connection pipe (6A, 6B). The water box and its connection pipes are treated with acidic decontamination solutions comprising valency IV cerium regenerated with ozone. A soft decontamination solution with pH lying between 2.5 and 3 is first circulated through each partial water box (2A, 2B) and through its connection pipe (6A, 6B). The connection pipes (6A, 6B) are then separated from the water box (2) and a hard decontamination solution with the pH lying between 0.5 and 1 is circulated through each partial water box (2A, 2B). The worn water box is replaced with a new water box.
