<ABSTRACT>
A method for using an over-the-roadway tractor, a puller (62) configured for interconnection to and powered by a tractor (60) for driving the puller over a railway, and railway bogies (24), for hauling one or more convertible roadway-railway trailers (2) over both a railway and roadway. The method includes configuring the trailer for railway travel and operating the tractor (60) to remove the trailer (2) from the roadway and position the trailer (2) on the railway, driving the tractor (60) onto the puller (62) and connecting the tractor (60) to the puller (62), drive system, operating the tractor (60) to connect the puller (62) to the trailer and drive the trailer (2) over the railway when the trailer is configured for railway travel and positioned on the railway, disconnecting the tractor (60) from the puller drive system and driving the tractor off of the puller, configuring the trailer (2) for roadway travel and operating the tractor (60) to remove the trailer (2) from the railway and position the trailer on the roadway, and operating the tractor (60) to drive the trailer over the roadway when the trailer (2) is configured for roadway travel and positioned on the roadway.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of assembling and 
disassembling a train of one or more convertible roadway-railway 
trailers having roadway tires according to the preamble 
of claim 1. In many areas such as rural locations and developing countries, 
railways are a more effective means of transportation 
than roadways. Unfortunately, known convertible railway-highway 
vehicles, such as that which is disclosed in US-A-4 
955 292, are relatively complicate to operate. According to 
this document the railroad bogies are always in proper engagement 
with the railroad tracks. Since the railway bogies 
never leave the railroad tracks, this prior system imposes 
substantial limitations to the operation. US-A-1 957 712 
discloses a motor truck driving up a rail car and establishing 
a mechanical linkage between the motor truck and a railcar 
driven wheel, the railcar thus acting as a puller. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a method of the type referred to above for conveniently 
converting vehicles between railway and highway 
travel operating modes at grade crossings avoiding the 
limitations to an efficient operation. In particular, converting 
the vehicle between railway and highway operating 
modes and efficiently operating the vehicle on both the 
railway and highway should be accomplished by one person. According to the invention, the object referred to is solved 
by the features of claim 1. The subclaims relate to further 
embodiments of the invention. The method according to the invention satisfies the continued 
need for improved convertible railway-roadway vehicles.  
 The present invention aims at a mode of transportation for 
smaller organisations or individuals such as farmers that 
are not hauling large quantities of goods typically required 
for the efficient operation of known bimodel systems. According 
to the invention the trailer is coupled to the bogie 
when the bogie is off the railway. The bogie is located at a 
storage area of the railway. After coupling the bogie to the 
trailer the tractor manoeuvres the trailer which travels on 
the roadway tires while the trailer is lifted to raise the 
railway wheels of the bogie from the ground to position the 
trailer and the bogie on the railway. After engaging the 
railway wheels with the railway, the roadway tires are disengaged 
from the ground. One person can conveniently use the 
tractor and puller to convert the trailers between highway 
and railway  
 
operating modes at any grade crossing, and to

<CLAIMS>
A method of assembling and disassembling a 
train of one or more convertible roadway-railway trailers 

(2) having roadway tires (10), including: 

configuring the trailer (2) for railway travel including 
operating a tractor (60) to position the trailer (2) over a 

railway bogie (24) having railway wheels (50) and coupling 
the trailer and the bogie, 
configuring the trailer (2) for roadway travel including 
uncoupling the bogie (24) from the trailer (2) and operating 

the tractor (60) to position the trailer (2) on the roadway, 
characterized by the steps of 
coupling the trailer (2) to the bogie (24), while the bogie 
(24) is located at a storage area off the railway and 

positioning the trailer (2) on the railway by the tractor 
(60) while the trailer is travelling on the roadway tires 

(10), engaging the railway wheels (50) with the railway and 
disengaging the roadway tires (10) from the ground, in 

configuring the trailer for railway travel, and disengaging 
the railway wheels (50) from the railway and engaging the 

roadway tires (10) with the ground, operating the tractor 
(60) to remove the trailer (2) and the bogie (24) from the 

railway and then uncoupling the bogie (24) from the trailer 
(2), in configuring the trailer for roadway travel. 
The method of claim 1, characterized by the roadway 
tires (10) being retractable, and: 


engaging the railway wheels (50) with the railway and 
disengaging the roadway tires (10) from the ground includes 

retracting the roadway tires (10); and 
disengaging the railway wheels (50) from the railway and 
engaging the roadway tires (10) with the ground includes 

extending the roadway tires (10). 
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterized by driving 
the tractor (60) onto a puller (62) comprising railway  

 
bogies (66) having railway wheels and connecting the tractor 

(60) to a puller drive system (68) including an electric 
motor (72) coupled to a driven wheel (76) of the puller and 

a generator (70) configured to be driven by an auxiliary 
power take off (74) of the tractor (60) for powering the 

electric motor (72). 
The method of one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by 
sliding the roadway wheels (10) slidably attached to the 

trailer (2) from the rear (8) of the trailer (2) towards the 
front (6) of the trailer (2) before positioning the trailer 

(2) over the railway bogies (24). 
The method of claim 4 characterized in that sliding the 
wheels (10) toward the front (6) of the trailer (2) 

includes: 

applying the brakes to the trailer wheels (10); and 
operating the tractor (60) to drive the trailer (2) in 
reverse and slide the wheels (10) toward the front (6) of 

the trailer (2). 
The method of one of claims 1 to 5 characterized in that
