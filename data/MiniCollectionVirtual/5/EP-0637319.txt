<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
cytokines. More specifically, the present invention
relates to a novel cytokine with broad anti-neoplastic
activity.Cell growth appears to be regulated by a
balance between growth stimulatory and growth
inhibitory molecules. An imbalance in these growth
regulatory cytokines has been proposed as one of the
mechanisms of tumor growth.Several cytokines which stimulate the growth
of tumor and normal cells have been described. These
include, e.g., epidermal growth factor (EGF),
fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet derived growth
factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factors (IGF),
interleukins (IL), colony stimulating factors (CSF) and
transforming growth factors (TGF-α and TGF-β).In contrast, other cytokines selectively
inhibit the growth of certain tumor cells. These
include, e.g., interferons (IFN), lymphotoxin (LT),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), oncostatin M,
amphiregulin, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and TGF-β.These growth stimulatory and growth
inhibitory cytokines can be differentiated from each
other based on their source, their specificity against
tumor targets, their physio-chemical properties and
their primary structure. Thus, the identification and 
characterization of growth regulatory cytokines is of critical importance in
the understanding of cellular growth, including growth of neoplasms.In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a novel
composition of matter. This novel composition of matter, termed
Oncoinhibin, is secreted by human erythroblastoid cells, has a molecular
weight of approximately 28 kDa on SDA-PAGE and exhibits diverse anti-neoplastic
activity. The oncoinhibin protein is substantially free of
impurities and substantially homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE,
and is stable in a pH range of from 2 to 8 and in a temperature range of
from 4 to 100°C.In one embodiment the present invention provides a method for
preparing a novel human cytokine termed Oncoinhibin. The method
comprises incubating human erythroblastoid cells, inducing the production
of Oncoinhibin and harvesting conditioned cell supernatants.In yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided
a method of purifying human Oncoinhibin. This method comprises the
steps of ultrafiltering conditioned cells supernatants containing human
Oncoinhibin. Subsequently in human Oncoinhibin and dialyzing the
ultrafiltered supernatants. Subsequently DEAE Affigel blue
chromatography, Sodium dodecyl Sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis
