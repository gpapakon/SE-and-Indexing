<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a screened electrical sub-assembly rack with, at the rear of the rack, a sheet-metal shroud (11) covering the back-panel wiring, the shroud having apertures (12) for screened plug-in connectors (1) designed to be plugged in the back. Each plug-in connector has sheathing (3) with spring-biased contact blades (4) which are contacted to a back-panel wiring plate (8) via a ring of earth-contact pins (10). The earth-contact pins (10) project into the apertures (12) in the shroud (11) and are pressed by the contact blades (4) against the inside wall of the apertures. This enables a closely spaced earth connection to be established between the plug-in connector (1), the shroud (11) and the back-panel wiring (8).

<CLAIMS>
A shielded electrical mounting rack having back-panel 
wiring which has contact pins (7) for plug connectors 

(1), for example cable plugs, which can be plugged 
on at the rear, the plug connectors (1) being surrounded 

by a shielding casing (3) which is provided with circumferential 
contact tongues (4) which are like leaf springs 

and can make contact with ground contact pins (10) on a 
back-panel wiring board (8) in the back-panel wiring, 

characterized in that the mounting rack has a shielding 
plate (11) which covers the back-panel wiring and is 

provided with apertures (12) for the plug connectors (1), 
in that the ground contact pins (10) for the contact 

tongues (4) project into the apertures (12) and can be 
pressed there, by the contact tongues (4), against the 

inner walls of the apertures (12). 
The mounting rack as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the ground contact pins (10) are made 

contact with by at least one ground layer (13) on the 
back-panel wiring board (8).
