<ABSTRACT>
A pulse color sorter which permits removal of internally 
and externally moldy pulse having afuratoxine as decomposition 

product is disclosed. The pulse color sorter comprises 
a first detector (20) which provides a first (S1) 

and a second detection signal (S2) according to dispersed 
and transmitted light having two different wavelengths (for 

instance 700 and 1,100 nm) with different contents of 
information due to the separation of wavelengths, a second 

detector (30) which provides a third detection signal (S3) 
according to reflected light, and a controller (50) which 

calculates division of the first and second detection 
signals from the first detector, compares the resultant 

value calculated to a first predetermined threshold value 
while also compares the third signal from the second detector 

to a second threshold value, and outputs an eject 
signal if either of the compared signals is beyond the 

corresponding threshold value. According to the eject 
signal, corresponding defective pulse is forcibly ejected. 

Since the judgment as to moldy pulse is done on the basis 
of the division of the first and second detection signals, 

accurate judgment is obtainable irrespective of the sizes 
of individual pieces of pulse.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color sorters and, more
particularly, to a color sorter for sorting pulse such as
peanuts.Japanese Patent Application Kokai-Publication No. Sho
No. 63-200878 (EP-A-0279041) discloses a color sorter of bichromatic type
for sorting pulse. In this color sorter, pulse passing a
detecting position continuously is illuminated from a light
source, and an optical system which is provided in three
directions measures and photoelectrically converts the
difference between light reflected from the pulse and light
from a reference color member (a background). When the
detected difference signal thus obtained exceeds a predetermined
level (a threshold value), the corresponding pulse
is judged as abnormal color defective pulse, such as unripe
pulse, worm-eaten pulse, etc. and the same is ejected by an
ejector.Japanese Patent Application Kokai-Publication No. Sho
63-315179 also discloses a color sorter of the same bichromatic
type wherein the sorting accuracy is enhanced. In
this color sorter, detecting positions are provided at two 
positions, i.e., above and below an ejector. Pulse which has been judged at the upper
detecting position as normal pulse and passed the ejector without being ejected, is
measured once again at the lower detecting position to check whether proper sorting has
been done in the upper detecting position. If it is found that the sorting is improper, the
result is fed-back to a controller so as to adjust or reset the threshold value for the upper
detecting position. Thus, the sorting accuracy is enhanced.GB-A-2 236 848 discloses a sorting apparatus in which two light detecting means detect
respectively two specific kinds of light having different wavelengths among condensed
rays of light transmitted through the article being sorted, and a judging means judges
whether or not the article is defective on the basis of whether the ratio between the
intensities of the two specific kinds of light is or is not higher than a predetermined
value.In the sorting of pulse, the foreign matter that has been contained in the material pulse,
such as earth, stones, grass, etc., can be comparatively readily removed using a specific
gravity sorter, a wind sorter, etc. Further, defective pulse such as unripe pulse and
worm-eaten pulse can be practically sufficiently removed by the conventional color
sorters of bichromatic type noted above, which is based on the light reflected from a
surface of the pulse. However, it is theoretically impossible to sort out moldy pulse as a
kind of defective
