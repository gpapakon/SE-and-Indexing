<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a bright-field transparency illumination device for a microscope in which a grid disc (8) is arranged in the illumination beam path (7) to provide uniform illumination for the luminous field diaphragm (LF) for large fields and small apertures (Fig. 1) and uniform illumination for the aperture diaphragm (AP) for small fields and large apertures (Fig. 2). The grid disc (8) is a plane-parallel transparent plate having a circular grid (8) at the centre.

<CLAIMS>
Bright field transmitted light illuminating equipment for a 
microscope, with a light source (1) with rectangular coil surface (6), 

a collector lens (2), a raster disc (3) arranged downstream of the 
collector lens (2) and with further lens members (4, 5), which are 

arranged in the illumination ray path (7), for the production of a 
Kohler type illumination, characterised thereby, that for the uniform 

illumination of the aperture stop (AP) in the case of large apertures 
and small object fields and for the uniform illumination of the light 

field stop (LF) in the case of small apertures and large object fields, 
the raster disc (3) is constructed as a plate with a parallelly planar 

outer region, through which substantially the illumination of the 
aperture stop (AP) takes place in the case of large light field stop 

(3), and with a central raster (8), which is arranged as a circular 
area around the illumination axis (9) and through which the region of the 

coil surface (6), which is used for small fields, is imaged several 
times into the aperture stop (AP). 
Bright field transmitted light illuminating equipment according to 
claim 1, characterised thereby, that the raster (8) comprises several 

individual prisms (10) arranged one beside the other. 
Bright field transmitted light illuminating equipment according to 
claim 1, characterised thereby, that the raster (8) is constructed as 

laminar grating (11) with individual grating lines (12) arranged one 
parallelly to the other.
