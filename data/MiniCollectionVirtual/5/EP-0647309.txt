<ABSTRACT>
A distributed fiber optic sensing system for detecting mechanical, acoustic or ultrasonic disturbances is disclosed. This system is optimized for use as an intrusion detection system in security applications. Light is launched into opposite ends of a sensing fiber loop (24) such that two beams circulate through the loop in opposite directions and then recombine to produce an interference pattern on a photoelectric detector (30). Disturbances of the sensing fiber loop produce corresponding changes in the interference pattern and thereby the signal level at the detector. The changes in the electrical signal from the detector are interpreted (28, 29) to provide alarms when the sensing fiber loop is impinged upon by intrusive disturbances, and to provide location of disturbances along the loop. Means (33, 31) are incorporated to decode uniquely coded sonic or ultrasonic signals from personal transmitters (37) borne by authorized personnel approaching the sensing fiber loop. A remotely activated system disturber (25) is affixed to the sensing fiber loop which, when activated by an operator, provides positive confirmation of sensing loop continuity and system operability.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DISTRIBUTED FIBER OPTIC SENSING SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to fiber optic systems and methods for detection and location of acoustic, ultrasonic, mechanical, and other disturbances. In particular, it relates to a system for detecting, locating, and identifying an intrusion upon a distributed fiber optic sensor. Description of the Related ArtDistributed optical fiber sensing systems based on the Sagnac interferometer and the Mach-Zehnder 2interferometers have been developed. These systems depend on the interferometric detection of phase differences between two optical signals whose relative phases have been shifted by changes in the optical properties of their respective paths caused by the acoustical, mechanical, or other measurand of interest. The change in optical property of the fiber path may be in the form of elongation, change in index of refraction, change in birefringence, or a combination of these or related effects.With modern low loss fibers and solid state laser diode sources, it has become possible to develop systems having single sensing loops up to several tens of kilometers in length. In one field of application, these fiber sensing loops can, for example, be placed under carpets, imbedded in walls, under roads, or under turf. In such installations, the sensors can be effective to detect the intrusion of personnel, vehicles, animals, etc. into a protected area of interest. Another application of interest is to use one or more of the fibers within a telecommunications or power cable as the distributed sensor element to provide information as to contact with or intrusion into the cable anywhere along its length. Such an arrangement would be most valuable for protection of the cable facilities of power or telephone companies against unauthorized intrusion or tampering. When 

deployed in this manner, the sensor can detect direct contact, mechanical pressure, or acoustic signals. By virtue of the interferometric phase sensing, such sensors have been found to have very high useable sensitivity over great lengths.While these distributed sensor systems are valuable in detecting events over large areas, they have several limitations. In particular, there are no convenient and economical means for determining the location of an event along the extensive sensing loop. A simple approach to this problem has been the breaking of a larger perimeter protecting loop into a number of smaller loops, each protecting a more limited zone. This, however,
