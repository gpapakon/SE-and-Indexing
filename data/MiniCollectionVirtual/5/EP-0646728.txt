<ABSTRACT>
A vortex compressor comprises a housing (1) which is provided with an annular operating channel, an inlet port (2) and a 
discharge port (3) connected to the annular operating channel, and a cut-off (4) situated between the inlet port (2) and the 

discharge port (3). The disk (5) of the operating wheel mounted in the housing (1) is provided with a vane rim (6) 
accommodated in the annular operating channel. The housing (1) and cut-off (4) are provided with interconnecting openings (7 

and 8) which are arch-shaped and equidistant from the vane rim (6). The inlet and outlet edges of the vane rim (6) are arranged 
coaxially at the edge of the lateral face of the disk (5). The inlet port (2) is in the form of an opening which
 is bow shaped and 
equidistant from the vane rim (6) and situated towards the inlet edges of the vanes, while the opening (7) in the housing (1) 

and the opening (8) in the cut-off (4) are situated towards the outlet edges of the vanes. The opening (7), the opening of the inlet 
port (2) and the cut-off are arranged in three segments on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the disk (5). The 

segment of the opening of the inlet port (2) is adjacent to the segment of the cut-off (4). Part of the segment of the cut-off (4) 
coincides with the segment of the opening in the housing, and the opening (8) in the cut-off (4) is situated in the part of the 

segment of the opening (7) of the housing (1) which coincides with segment of the cut-off (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field of machine
building and can be utilized in compressors of a vortex
type.There is known a vortex compressor comprising a casing
with an annular working channel having a suction and
discharge ports, a shut-off device arranged in the channel
between the ports, an impeller mounted in the casing, a
disc of the impeller having a ring with the blades thereon,
and the shut-off device has an orifice for gas removal
(DE, A, 2409184).In this design, gas, contained in the interblade space
of the blading and heated in the process of compression, is
partially released from the shut-off device through the
orifice. This provides a reduction of an undesirable
transfer of hot gas from a compressor suction side to a
discharge one and an increase of the machine efficiency. The
gas is removed from the shut-off device back to the working
channel through said orifice along a special pipeline to
a zone of an intermediate pressure. Although this design
reduce a harmful impact of a ballast gas, it is not
sufficient since hot gas under some intermediate pressure
appears at the compressor suction side from the interblade
space of the blading.There is further known a vortex compressor comprising
a casing wherein are formed an annular working channel, a 
suction and discharge ports communicating with the annular
channel, a shut-off device arranged between the suction and
discharge ports, an impeller mounted in the casing, on a
disc of the impeller being mounted a ring of blades located
in the annular working channel, wherein the casing and
shut-off device comprise slots of arched shape,
communicating therebetween and equidistant to the blading
(SU, A, 328265).In this design, a ballast hot gas from the interblade
space is almost completely removed to an ambiemt air and
excluded from the process of compression in the compressor.
Said design provides blowing effect when owing to a
specific arched shape and arrangement of the slot, the hot
gas in the interblade space is replaced by cold gas
entering from the atmosphere. Such a blowing ensures an
essential increase of the machine efficiency, reduction of
the gas temperature at the suction side due to lack of
replenishment by a ballast hot gas, raise of a compression
extent at this stage and improvement of weight output. In
said design, the blowing extent depends substantially on a
size of the arched slot. From the one hand, the reduction
of an arched slot length results in incomplete blowing with
all resulting sequences. From the other hand,
