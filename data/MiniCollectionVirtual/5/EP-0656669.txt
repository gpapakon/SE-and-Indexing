<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the hydrometallurgical regeneration (reprocessing) of spent domestic and appliance batteries in order to recover the raw materials, in particular those containing metal. Said process comprises the fine powder, which is produced by the batteries being shredded and the residual materials being separated, being solubilised (digested) by means of a sulphuric acid and, in the process, at least a large proportion of the substances contained in the powder being brought into solution,  alkali being metered in to raise the pH, after at least one further process step the metallic raw materials being recovered from the metal salt solutions which have been produced selectively and in each case contain only one metal as the main component, and then the remaining sulphate solution, which is low in metal and contains salts, being worked up (processed) by a dialysis and the sulphuric acid recovered in the process and the alkali being fed back into the process cycle. So as to make it possible for the reagents in the form of the process acids and/or the process alkalis to be reused without difficulty, without the dialysis being impaired or the dialysis system being destroyed, and without premature wear of the anodes taking place in the electrolysis systems and without any emissions of ammonia taking place, the low-metal sulphate solution prior to the electrolysis is passed over an ion exchanger and all the residual metals present in the sulphate solution as cations are removed.

Process for hydrometallurgical treatment of spent
household and device batteries for recovering heavy metal

raw materials, particularly zinc, nickel, cadmium,
copper, lithium and manganese, in which the fine powder

produced by comminuting the batteries and separating off
residual materials is digested by means of sulphuric acid

and thus at least the largest part of the contents of the
powder is dissolved, in which lye is metered in to

increase the pH value, in which after at least one
further process step, the metallic raw materials are

recovered from the selectively obtained metal salt
solutions containing in each case only one metal as the

main constituent, and in which then the remaining, low-metal
and salt-containing sulphate solution is treated by

dialysis and the sulphuric acid thus obtained and the lye
is fed back to the process circulation, characterised in

that the low-metal sulphate solution is passed over an
ion exchanger before electrolysis and all residual

contents of the previously extracted heavy metals present
as cations in the sulphate solution are deposited.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the sulphate solution is subjected to adsorptive

treatment before or after the ion exchanger and hence the
organic contents, in particular organic acids or

solvents, are separated off by binding to adsorbent
materials.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the sulphate solution is additionally passed over a

selective ion exchanger before the ion exchanger and
hence lithium and/or rare earths are recovered. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 - 3,
characterised in that the sulphate solution is passed

over a filter device or the like, in particular for
deposition of solids, before its chemical treatment.
Process according to at least one of claims 1 - 4,
characterised in that after dialysis, at least one

partial stream of the dialysis acid is concentrated and
the sulphuric acid is thermally separated from the

hydrochloric acid formed in the process and/or optionally
metered in.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that
the separated hydrochloric acid and optionally some of

the sulphuric acid are discharged from the process
circulation.
Process according to at least one of claims 1 - 4,
characterised in that after dialysis, at least one

partial stream of dialysis lye is concentrated and the
lye of low volatility is thermally separated from the

ammonia water formed in the process.
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that
the ammonia water obtained and optionally some of the

caustic soda is discharged from the process circulation.
Process according to at least one of claims 1 or 4,
characterised in that after dialysis, ammonia is

separated off from the dialysis lye by stripping.
