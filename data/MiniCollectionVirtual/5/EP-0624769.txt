<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for closing the bottom taphole, provided with a closing device, of a metallurgical vessel. In order to create a low-wear, easily maintained closing installation with constructionally simple, easily exchangeable components for secure closing of the taphole, it is proposed to introduce, before the end of pouring, a flowable material mixed with a binder into the bottom taphole (13) and to discharge the gases, being evolved during the subsequent reaction, predominantly through the closing device (20) and/or through the flowable material-feeding device (30). The combustion residue of the binder blocks the taphole (13) and is prevented from trickling out by a mechanical barrier device (20).

A method for closing the base tap of a metallurgical vessel, which base 
tap is provided with a closure arrangement, in which before completion of the 

pouring of the metal melt contrary to the direction of flow of the stream of 
metal a flowable material, mixed with a binding agent, is introduced into the 

base taphole,
 
characterised in that 


a) the gases developing during the reaction of the metal melt and the 
mixture of flowable material and binding agent are predominantly carried off 

through the closure arrangement and/or the arrangement for the supply of 
flowing material, and 
b) the binding agent burns without a residue, the remaining material in fluid 
form blocks the taphole and is prevented from trickling out by means of a 

mechanical shut-off device, until the next tapping. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the flowable material is sand which is mixed with a binding agent combustible at 

a temperature of over 200Â°, for example glucol. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the combustion gases of the binding agent are sucked out. 
A base tap of a metallurgical vessel with a device for closing the taphole, 
in which in addition a portion of a metal melt is situated, with a plate which is 

connected via a pipe connection to a conveying arrangement through which 
flowable material is able to be introduced into the taphole, to carry out the 

method according to Claim 1,
  
 

characterised in that
 
the plate has two orifices (22, 23) which, with the plate (21) being guided 

parallel to the vessel base (11), are able to be brought coaxially to the main tap 
axis (I),
 
the spacing (a) of the two orifices (22, 23) is greater than their greatest diameter 

(D),
 
the plate (21) has elements (25) on which the pipe connection (31) is able to be 

fastened, and
 
the taphole (13) is formed from a hollow bedstone (54) which has elements (52, 

53) for gaseous media to flow through, to which elements (52, 53) a suction 
arrangement (50) is connected. 
A device according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the elements (25) have a shape matching each other, which makes possible a 

form-fitting connection of the plate (21) with the pipe connection (31). 
A device according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the pipe connection (31) is the discharge (33) of a worm conveyor (32). 
A device according to Claim 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the worm conveyor (32) is connected with at least one storage container (34) 

arranged outside the vessel (10). 
A device according to Claim 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the material supply unit consisting of storage container (34), worm conveyor (32) 

and pipe connection (33) is able to be swivelled in a plane vertical to the main  
 

tapping axis (I). 
A device according to Claim 8,
 
characterised in that
 
the material supply unit (32 to 34) is movable in the travelling direction of the 

pusher. 
A device according to Claim 9,
 
characterised in that the material supply unit (32 to 34) has coupling elements 

(35) to which a drive unit for pushing the closure arrangement (20) is able to be 
connected with gripper elements (42). 
A device according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that
 
a bore (26), arranged vertically to the plate (21) in the pouring jet direction,
 is 
provided against the orifice (22) of the plate (21) which is provided for the 

outflow of the melt. 
A device according to Claim 11,
 
characterised in that
 
on the side of the plate (21), facing away from the vessel (10), a protective pipe 

(12) is detachably secured coaxially to the axis of the bore (26) via elements 
(24). 
A device according to Claim 11,
 
characterised in that
 
the orifice (23) provided parallel to the orifice (22) provided for the outflow of 

the melt is able to be connected via an opening (27) in the plate (21) to the 
pipe connection (31) which has a 90 degree deflection within the plate (21).  

 
A device according to Claim 13,
 
characterised in that
 
the plate (21) has sheets (28) arranged parallel to each other and vertically to 

the main tapping axis (I).
