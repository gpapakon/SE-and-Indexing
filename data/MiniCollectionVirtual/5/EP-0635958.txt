<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
designing a communications network comprising a
physical network and a logical network, and to a
method of managing the designed communications
network. The designing method aims to have a system
quickly and flexibly respond to, for example, the
fluctuation of traffic using simple designing
procedures by individually designing the topology and
the capacity of the communications network. The
managing method aims to shorten the time taken for
selection of an applicable communications path in
response to a request to connect a virtual path, and
to enable the capacity to be altered, in response to a
request to alter the capacity of a communications
path, by quickly selecting one of a plurality of
virtual paths defined between two nodes in the
communications path.The present invention has been developed based on 
the following background. First, the concept of a
logical network has been introduced into the concept
of an ATM network, that is, forming a communication
network of a new generation. Second, the topology and
the capacity of the logical network can be flexibly
set and independently controlled. Third, as
communications networks grow in scale and
communications services are vigorously diversified, it
has become very hard to precisely estimate the traffic
demand and characteristics accommodated in a
communications network, and their values are subject
to constant changes.Thus, a conventional complicated optimization
design method using a specific traffic pattern does
not work effectively, and such a simple and flexible
method of designing a communications network is needed
which flexibly handles various traffic conditions.
Since both a physical network and a logical network
are required in designing a communications network,
respective shares of both networks should be carefully
considered to design the simplest possible network.According to the conventional technology of
designing a communications network comprising a
physical network and a logical network, the logical
network is optimally designed, first based on a 
specific traffic condition and request quality, and
then in accordance with the result the physical
network is designed for optimal accommodation.
Accordingly, if a traffic condition or a request
quality of a service is changed, then the above
described design cycle must be reconsidered from the
very beginning, thereby falling into the problem that
traffic fluctuation cannot be quickly reflected.Furthermore, with remarkable progress in
informati
