<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric filter and a dielectric duplexer,
more specifically, a dielectric filter and a dielectric duplexer for the dual band to
be used in a communication devices etc., for the microwave band and the
millimeter wave band.In a construction of a high frequency circuit part for the dual band to be
used for a communication device for the microwave band or the millimeter wave
band, such a circuit part has been constituted by combining two band pass filters
101,121 shown in FIGs. 10 and 11. The band pass filter 101 shown in FIG. 10 is
provided with three resonators utilizing a TEM mode.In FIG. 10, the high frequency circuit part comprises a dielectric block 102,
through holes 103 in which an inner conductor is provided on an inner wall
surface, electrode patterns 104 for regulating the respective resonance frequency
of TEM mode resonators and the electromagnetic coupling therewith, an outer
conductor 105 provided on an outer surface of the dielectric block 102 except for
an open end surface 102a, and input/output electrodes 106 for TEM mode.The band pass filter 121 shown in FIG. 11 is provided with three
resonators utilizing a TE mode. In FIG. 11, the band pass filter is provided with
a dielectric block 122, a line conductor 123 for TE mode coupling, outer
conductors 124a, 124b which are provided on upper and lower surfaces of the
dielectric block 122 and electrically connected to each other via the line
conductor 123, and input/output electrodes 125 for TE mode.Apart from the above described structure, there are some cases where 
the high frequency circuit part for the dual band comprises the band pass filter of
one-input/two-output type making use of a duplexer.However, in either case, there is a problem that a space to be occupied
by two band pass filters is required when the above described filter are mounted
on a printed circuit board, etc.To solve this problem, a composite parts miniaturized by integrating the
TEM mode band pass filter 101 and the TE mode band pass filter 121 which are
illustrated in FIGs. 10 and 11 respectively, can be designed. However, only by
integrating the TEM mode band pass filter 101 and the TE mode band pass filter
121, the line conductor 123 for the TE mode coupling is required to be obtained
between the electrode patterns 104 formed on the open end surface 102a of the
TEM mode band pass filter 101, and the electromagnetic coupling of the TEM
mode resonators with each other is affected by the line conductor 123. Thus, it
is difficult to
