<ABSTRACT>
The flow of liquid (2) is dragged by the jet of steam (4) of a super-sonic nozzle 
(3) within a chamber (7) that has a first converging conical part (8) and a 

second diverging conical part (9); in said first conical part (8) a first aperture 
(10) is included that communicates with a first discharge duct (11) controlled by 

a first valve (12) and, downstream the first aperture (10), there is also a second 
aperture (13) that communicates with a second discharge duct (14) that bears a 

second valve (15) controlled so as to obtain the injector's maximum 
performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a steam injection system for high pressures, in
particular upto about 9 MPa, comprising especially an injector to achieve the
injection of a liquid into a vessel containing a liquid under pressure as may be
made necessary in emergency cases both in a "boiling water" type nuclear
reactor, the operation pressure of which is close to 7 MPa, and in a secondary
steam generator of a "pressurized water" type station in which the injection of
water at pressures close to those specified above are required. The emergency
cases mentioned are, for example, those caused by the breakage of the primary
system of a boiling water reactor and subsequent loss of cooling fluid.The prior art comprehends US-A-4,440,719 that discloses a system for
the injection of emergency water into the vessel of a boiling water reactor that
uses the very steam from the reactor. This system is essentially made up of two
steam injectors in series; the water exiting the first injector is partly sent to a jet
pump that pressurizes the water entering the same injector, after having been
cooled in a heat exchanger. The remaining part of water is cooled in a different
heat exchanger and enters a second injector. In this latter injector the water, the
pressure of which has already been increased in the first injector, is further
pressurized and finally injected into the reactor vessel.A simplified version of said system is presented in the paper "The First
JSME/ASME Joint International Conference on Nuclear Engineering -
November 4th - 7th, 1991 - Vol. 1": a two stage injection system that does not
use exchangers and jet pumps, as is in the said patent. This system comprised
two steam injectors in series; the water exited the first stage at a pressure of
about 2 MPa and then entered a second injector where its pressure was raised to
reference pressures and higher. Two different types of injectors where used: 
while in the first stage an injector with steam injected centrally and water
laterally, the second stage used an injector patented by C. Nicodemus of Helios
Research Corporation with central water and lateral steam (US-A-4 569 635).
In a further experiment said patented injector was replaced by an injector with
water injected laterally, but with a double entry of steam (central and lateral, but
more external than the water).Also in this case the system, again comprising two injectors in series, gave good
results.A further simplification consisting in the use of a single injector (also in this case
eliminating

<CLAIMS>
A steam injection system for high pressures, in particular upto about 9 MPa,
comprising a first chamber (1), a lead duct (2,21) for introducing a flow

of liquid into the first chamber at a pressure barely above atmospheric pressure, a super-sonic
nozzle (3) with a converging-diverging shape for introducing a jet of steam (4)

under pressure into an entry aperture (5) of a second chamber (6) into which
the steam carries said flow of liquid, said second chamber (6) being formed by a

first converging conical part (7) in the direction followed by the mixture of
liquid and steam and by a second divergent conical part (8) that functions as a

diffusor, said first conical part (7) having a first aperture (9) that communicates
with a first discharge duct (10) bearing a first starting valve (11) that is

controlled by the pressure within the injector so as to open when the pressure in said second
chamber (6) rises above a given value of pressure downstream said first valve so

as to allow the discharge of part of said mixture and that closes automatically
when the pressure in said second chamber drops below said given value of

pressure, the system being
 
   
characterized
 in that a second aperture (12) is made in said first conical
part (7) downstream said first aperture (9), said second aperture

communicating with a second discharge duct (13) bearing a second valve (14)
which is controlled to increase its aperture with the decreasing of the steam

pressure and vice versa in order to allow the maximum liquid outlet flowrate
consistent with the desired outlet pressure.
A steam injection system according to claim 1 characterized in that a
liquid feeding source (23) is in communication with the steam injector (20)

through said lead duct of the liquid (2,21) and a valve (32) so controlled as to

cause an increasing degree of aperture with the increasing of the steam
pressure and a drop in the rate of liquid taken from said liquid source (23)

having equal discharge rate from the injector compatible with the feed rates
required, so that the injector may provide said maximum liquid outlet

flowrate.
