<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a leather-like sheet
material having an excellent flexibility, drape and moisture
permeability, as well as a good appearance with smooth and
high-quality feeling resembling natural leather, and being
most suitable for grain-type apparels, various gloves, soft
sports shoes and similar uses, and a process for its
production.Known grain-type leather-like materials having excellent
flexibility and moisture permeability include laminates
of a fibrous base layer containing a porous elastic polymer
and a porous coating layer principally comprising an elastic
polymer or non-porous coating layer, and those comprising
the former and further a layer of a non-porous coating layer
on the surface of the porous coating layer. To obtain the
porous coating layer for the above purpose, there are
available a wet coagulation process which comprises treating
an elastic polymer solution with a non-solvent for the
polymer to coagulate it into a porous structure, a process
which comprises preparing a composition by mixing an elastic
polymer solution with readily extractable fine particles,
e.g. salts, starch and gelatin, applying the composition on 
a base, followed by drying, and then extracting off the fine
particles, a process which comprises kneading an elastic
polymer with the above readily extractable fine particles,
forming the obtained blend into a sheet and then extracting
off the fine particles, a dry foaming process and the like.Besides, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos.
91279/1990, 169777/1990 and 307987/1990 propose a process
which comprises forming on the surface of a wet-formed
finely porous layer a polyurethane resin layer containing
fine particles of a water-soluble natural polymer such as
gelatin or starch and then dissolving off the water-soluble
fine particles, to form a porous coating layer.US-A-5 151 240 discloses a leather-like material which is
constituted of two layers:
a substrate comprising a fiber aggregate as a skeleton
and a microporous grain layer having an average thickness of
20 µm to 300 µm. The grain layer is superimposed onto one
surface of the substrate in such a fashion that the inner
layer portion of the grain layer permeates partially into
interstices of the fiber aggregate and is bonded to fibers in
the adjoining surface layer of the substrate.JP-02169777 A discloses a synthetic leather which is composed
of (A) a base material, (B) a layer having fine pores, (C) a
middle layer and (D) a surface layer. Layers (C) and (D) are
produced by
