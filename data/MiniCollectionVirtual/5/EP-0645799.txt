<ABSTRACT>
Silver is added to the fill of an 
electrodeless high intensity metal halide discharge 

lamp, which includes at least one metal iodide as a 
fill ingredient, for controlling the iodine vapor 

level therein. In operation, silver reacts with free 
iodine, forming silver iodide (AgI), which has a 

relatively high boiling point and a relatively low 
vapor pressure. The iodine level is thus controlled 

below an arc instability threshold to promote and 
maintain arc stability. In addition, silver does not 

attack the quartz arc tube wall because silica (SiO₂) 
is much more stable than silver oxide (Ag₂O). 

Moreover, the addition of silver to the arc tube does 
not accelerate the decomposition of iodides in the 

fill, such as sodium iodide (NaI), cerium iodide 
(CeI₃), lanthanum iodide (LaI₃), neodymium iodide 

(NdI₃), and praeseodymium iodide (PrI₃), which would 
otherwise enhance devitrification and etching of the 

quartz wall. Lamp performance and life are thus 
substantially improved using silver as an iodine 

getter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
high intensity metal halide discharge lamps and, more 
particularly, to the use of silver in metal halide 
discharge lamps for controlling the iodine level 
therein and thereby promoting arc stability and 
improving lamp performance. In operation of a high intensity metal 
halide discharge lamp, visible radiation is emitted by 
the metal portion of the metal halide fill at 
relatively high pressure upon excitation typically 
caused by passage of current therethrough. One class 
of high intensity metal halide lamps comprises 
electrodeless lamps which generate an arc discharge by 
establishing a solenoidal electric field in the high-pressure 
gaseous lamp fill comprising the combination 
of one or more metal halides and an inert buffer gas. 
In particular, the lamp fill, or discharge plasma, is 
excited by radio frequency (RF) current in an 
excitation coil surrounding an arc tube which contains 
the fill. The arc tube and excitation coil assembly 
acts essentially as a transformer which couples RF 
energy to the plasma. That is, the excitation coil 
acts as a primary coil, and the plasma functions as a 
single-turn secondary. RF current in the excitation 
coil produces a time-varying magnetic field, in turn 
creating an electric field in the plasma which closes  
 
completely upon itself, i.e., a solenoidal electric 
field. Current flows as a result of this electric 
field, producing a toroidal arc discharge in the arc 
tube. Typical electrodeless metal halide 
discharge lamps use metal halides for generating white 
color lamp emission for general lighting applications. 
Disadvantageously, however, free iodine formation and 
devitrification of the arc tube wall occur in 
electrodeless high intensity metal halide discharge 
lamps after exposure to the plasma arc discharge. The 
amount of free iodine in the arc tube increases with 
time. This accumulating iodine, beyond a certain 
threshold, causes arc instability and eventual arc 
extinction. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an 
iodine getter for controlling the iodine level in 
electrodeless high intensity metal halide discharge 
lamps and thereby promote arc stability. To be 
practicable, such an iodine getter should extend the 
useful life of the lamp and hence not enhance 
devitrification and etching of the arc tube wall. Silver is added to the fill of an 
electrodeless high intensity metal halide discharge 
lamp, which includes at least one metal iodide as a 
fill ingredient, for controlling the
