<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising conductive 
particles and one or more polymers, particularly acid copolymers or 
ionomers which can be extruded or heat formed into films or coatings. More 
specifically, the heat processing of the present invention is directed to a 
novel, non-uniform heating method, wherein the edge portions of a material 
comprising acid copolymer and/or ionomer is heated 3 - 50 degrees Celsius 
hotter than the central or middle portion of the article or film during 
fabrication to thereby provide improved and substantially uniform surface 
resistivity properties. Plastics are often considered for use as electrical insulating materials, 
because they typically do not readily conduct electrical current and are 
generally rather inexpensive relative to other known insulating materials. A 
number of known plastics are sufficiently durable and heat resistant to 
provide at least some electrical insulating utility, but many such plastics are 
problematic due to the accumulation of electrostatic charge on the surface 
of the material. Such surface charge accumulation can be undesirable for various 
reasons. Such materials sometimes discharge very quickly, and this can 
damage electronic components, or cause fires or explosions, depending upon 
the environment. Sudden static discharge can also be an annoyance to those 
using the material. Even where sudden static discharge is not a problem, dust will 
typically be attracted to and will accumulate on materials carrying a static 
charge. Furthermore, the static charge can interfere with sensitive electronic 
components or devices and the like.  
 Resistivity can be defined as involving surface resistivity 
and volume resistivity. If the volume resistivity is in an appropriate 
range, an alternative pathway is provided through which a charge can 
dissipate (generally along the surface). Indeed, surface resistivity is typically 
the primary focus for electrostatic dissipating ("ESD") polymeric materials. Surface resistivity is an electrical resistance measurement (typically 
measured in ohms per square) taken at the surface of a material at room 
temperature. Where the surface resistivity is less than or equal to about 105, 
the composition's surface has very little insulating ability and is generally 
considered to be conductive. Such compositions are generally poor 
electrostatic dissipating polymeric materials, because the rate of bleed off is 
too high. Where the surface resistivity is greater than 1012, the

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing an acid copolymer or ionomer composition 
having a substantially uniform electrical resistivity along its outer surface, said 

process comprising the steps of: 

combining the acid copolymer or ionomer composition with a 
plurality of conductive particles and heating the mixture until it becomes a flowable 

melt; 
forcing the flowable melt into an extrusion cavity (27) characterized 
in that: 
having a middle zone (28c) and at least two outer edge zones 
(28a
&
e), where the temperature of the outer edge zones (28a
&
e) are about 3 to 50 
degrees Celsius higher than the temperature of the center or middle zone (28c) and 

thereafter cooling the extruded melt. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the extrusion cavity (27) is further 
defined as an extrusion die and the edge zone temperatures are about 4 to about 40 

degrees Celsius higher than the middle zone temperature. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the edge zone temperatures are about 5 
to 30 degrees Celsius higher than the middle zone temperature. 
Process of Claim 1 wherein the conductive particles are metal, carbon, 
semiconductive oxides or combinations thereof.
