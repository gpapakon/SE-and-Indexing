<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic medium (30) comprises a substrate (31) 
formed with a stepped pit (33) which is divided into at 

least two sections by an imaginary plane substantially 
at right angles to the surface of said substrate (31), 

said sections being different in depth from each other, 
and a magnetic substance (32) buried in said stepped 

pit (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic medium that 
is used as magnetic patterns of a magnetic scale or in 
a DC motor, and a method of manufacturing a magnetic 
medium.  
 Generally, a magnetic head made of an electromagnet 
and a magnetic substance made of minute magnets are used in a 
magnetic recording and regenerating apparatus. In the case 
of the magnetic recording, the magnetic head generates a magnetic 
field that varies in accordance with record information, 
and the remanent magnetism of the magnetic substance 
moving through the magnetic field varied by that record 
information is caused to change in position. The record 
information is then recorded on the magnetic substance on 
basis of the positional change of the remanent magnetism. On 
the other hand, the magnetic head detects the positional 
change of the remanent magnetism of the magnetic substance as 
a voltage change. The principles of the magnetic recording and regeneration 
as above mentioned have also been utilized in a 
magnetic sensor. That is, in the magnetic sensor, predetermined 
magnetic patterns are manufactured accurately by the 
magnetic head for recording, and the magnetic patterns are 
detected by the magnetic head for detection in order to 
acquire information on a position. As an example of a conventional method of manufacturing 
magnetic patterns, a method of manufacturing linear-type 
magnetic patterns will hereinafter be described. First  
 
of all, a magnetic pattern manufacturing apparatus 1 is 
prepared as shown in FIG. 63. The magnetic pattern manufacturing 
apparatus 1 comprises a position detector 2, interconnecting 
members 3 and 4, an actuator 5, a magnetic head 6 and 
an I/V (current/voltage) converting circuit 7. A magnetic 
medium 8 is connected to the position detector 2 and the 
actuator 5 through the interconnecting members 3 and 4. The 
actuator 5 causes the magnetic medium 8 to move accurately in 
the opposite directions indicated by the arrows A and B in 
FIG. 63, and the position of the magnetic medium 8 is detected 
by the position detector 2. If the medium 8 is moved and fixed to a predetermined 
position by the actuator 5, then it contacts with the 
head ends 6a and the medium 8. An electric current is then 
applied to the coil of the magnetic head 6 by the I/V converting 
circuit 7 so that a magnetic field is generated. As 
a consequence, the magnetic medium 8 in the neighborhood of 
the magnetic head ends 6a and 6a is partly magnetized. Subsequently, the magnetic medium 8 is moved to 
an
