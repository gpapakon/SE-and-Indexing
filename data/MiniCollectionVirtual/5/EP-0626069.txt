<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an automated multiparameter bioaffinity assay method. The method uses a mixture of prefabricated microparticles distributed in different categories and representing different analytes. The microparticles representing different categories contain different amounts of a fluorescent dye and are coated with biospecific reactants binding different analytes. The sample to be analysed is added and a mixture of biospecific secondary reactants labelled with a molecule generating or catalyzing luminescence or with a fluorescent or phosphorescent molecule is added to the said mixture. The fluorescent dye is activated, and the category of the microparticle is identified by means of the strength of the fluorescent emission. The biospecific binding reaction is measured by means of the signal from the molecule generating or catalysing luminescence or the signal from the fluorescent or phosphorescent molecule. According to the invention, the identification of the microparticle category and the measurement of the biospecific binding reaction, and possibly also dispensing, mixing, incubation and separation of the free fraction are carried out within a system of microchannels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
method for automated multiparameter bioaffinity assay
using prefabricated microparticles distributed into
different categories and representing different analytes,
in which method the microparticles belonging to different
categories contain different amounts of a fluorescent dye,in which method the microparticles of different
categories are coated with biospecific reactants binding
different analytes,in which method the microparticles of different
categories are mixed in a suspension into which suspension
the sample is added, into said suspension a mixture of
biospecific secondary reactants labelled with a molecule
generating or catalysing luminescence or a fluorescent or a
phosphorescent molecule is added,in which method the fluorescent dye is activated and the
strength of the fluorescent emission is measured separately
for each particle for the identification of the
microparticle category,and in which method the label of the biospecific
secondary reactant is activated and the biospecific binding
reaction is measured by means of the signal from the
molecule generating or catalysing luminescence or from the
fluorescent or phosphorescent molecule.The said method is specifically used to perform and automate
multiparameter assays based on the use of microparticles,
especially in such as those described in US-A-5 028 545 and
the like. Immunoassay is an assay method based on bioaffinity and
widely used for biologically active molecules in clinical
diagnostics and in research laboratories. Another important
assay method based on bioaffinity is the DNA hybridization
assay. The crucial reactant in bioaffinity assays is e.g.
an antibody or a DNA probe, which is most often coupled to
a solid support such as the wall of a test tube. The said
reactant binds the molecule to be assayed (the analyte),
and the specificity of the assay is determined above all by
the characteristics of said reactant. Bioaffinity assays,
which will be later also called biospecific assays, often
involve a second antibody or a DNA probe labelled with,
e.g., a fluorescent molecule. The complex generated in the
biospecific reaction, which is bound to the solid phase,
and comprises both biospecific reactants, the analyte
molecule and the label, is separated from free labelled
reactant, or the free fraction, by, e.g., washing the free
fraction away, after which the strength of the signal
produced by the label is measured by a suitable
microphotometric method, which in case of fluorescent
labels is a fluorometer, and
