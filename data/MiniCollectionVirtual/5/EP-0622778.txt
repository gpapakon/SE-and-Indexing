<ABSTRACT>
An active adaptive noise canceller (100) that inserts 
delays into the weight update logic of an adaptive filter 

to keep the filter stable. The noise and residual noise 
are sensed (102, 108) and the respective sensor signals are 

digitized at a given sample rate for processing in the 
adaptive filter (113). To eliminate the need for high 

sample rates while maintaining flexibility in the frequency 
regions over which the adaptive filter is stable, the delay 

(116) introduced into the weight update logic is a non-integer 
multiple of the sample period. The non-integer 

sample delay (118) is obtained by a sample interpolation 
and decimation procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention as it is defined in the appended claims relates to active noise cancellation
systems.The objective in active noise cancellation is to
generate a waveform that inverts a nuisance noise source
and suppresses it at selected points in space. In active
noise cancelling, a waveform is generated for subtraction,
and the subtraction is performed acoustically, rather than
electrically.In a basic active noise cancellation system, a noise
source or vibration is measured with a local sensor such as
an accelerometer or microphone. The noise propagates
acoustically over an acoustic channel to a point in space
where noise suppression is desired, and at which is placed
another microphone. The objective is to remove the acoustic
energy components due to the noise source. The measured
noise waveform from the local sensor is input to an
adaptive filter, the output of which drives a speaker. The
second microphone output at the point to be quieted serves
as the error waveform for updating the adaptive filter.
The adaptive filter changes its weights as it iterates in
time to produce a speaker output that at the microphone
looks as much as possible (in the minimum mean squared
error sense) like the inverse of the noise at that point in
space. Thus, in driving the error waveform to have minimum 
power, the adaptive filter removes the noise by driving the
speaker to invert it.Many previous active noise cancelers use the filtered-X
LMS algorithm, which requires a training mode. The
function of the training mode is to learn the transfer
functions of the speaker and microphones used in the system
so that compensation filters can be inserted in the feedback
loop of the LMS algorithm to keep it stable. As the
physical situation changes, the training mode must be re-initiated.
For example, in an automobile application to
suppress noise within a passenger compartment, the training
mode may need to be performed again every time a window is
opened, or another passenger enters the compartment, or
when the automobile heats up during the day. The training
mode can be quite objectionable to passengers in the
vehicle.Commonly assigned U.S. Patent 5,117,401,
describes an active adaptive noise canceller which
does not require a training mode. The insertion of a time
delay in the computation of the weight updates modifies the
frequency stability regions of the canceller. Hence, the
canceller provides a mechanism through which the adaptive
noise cancellation can be easily adapted to suit any
application at hand by simply
