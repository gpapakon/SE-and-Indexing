<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an oriented blown film of a 
thermoplastic resin by blown film extrusion, comprising 

blowing air into an extruded bubble (e) of the resin extruded from 
a ring die (d) to expand the bubble and cooling the expanded 

bubble with air from a cooling air ring (24), wherein blown film 
extrusion is carried out under such conditions that the ratio 

of (b) the final diameter of the expanded bubble to (a) the 
diameter of the bubble at the crystallizing temperature of the 

thermoplastic resin ((b)/(a)) ranges from 1.5 to 10. The 
process provides an oriented blown film excellent in strength, 

appearance, and heat shrinkage characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blown-film extrusion of
thermoplastic resins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene,
linear low-density polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate
copolymers, poly-1-butene, ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers,
ethylene-alkyl methacrylate copolymers, and polystyrene. More
particularly, it relates to blown-film extrusion in which an
extruded bubble of the resin is orientated at a temperature
below the crystallizing temperature of the resin.Blown-film extrusion of thermoplastic resins is carried
out by use of a blown-film extrusion machine as shown in
FIG. 7.Such a blown-film extrusion machine and the extrusion method
described hereinafter by reference to Fig. 7 are known from
EP-A-0544098. In blown-film extrusion machine 1, starting
thermoplastic resin c is stored in storage hopper 2. Under
instructions from a computer, load cell 3 works in accordance
with the blown film take-off speed to feed thermoplastic resin
c automatically to feed hopper 4. Thermoplastic resin c is fed
from feed hopper 4 to extruder 5 having screw 7 driven by
screw motor 6, where it is melt-kneaded and extruded upward
from the head of the extruder. Blowing head 9 containing ring
die d is provided at the head of extruder 5 in the vertical
direction via direct coupling 8. To blowing head 9 is
connected inflator (air pump) 12 via pipe 11 having 
electromagnetic valve 10 so that air is blown into the inside
of the extruded resin tube to form tubular bubble e.Tubular bubble e is then inflated and cooled with air fed
from cooling blower 14 through air cooling ring 13 set above
blowing head 9.Tubular bubble e is guided by a pair of guide plates 15
and passed through a pair of nip rolls 17 driven by take-off
motor to obtain flattened tube f.Flattened tube f is introduced into width measuring means
18 in which the flattened width is measured by width sensor 19
and then, while being guided by guide rolls 20, 21, 21, wound
up around paper reel g held by reel holder 23 in wind-up 22.Where the blown film is to be used as a bag-forming film,
flattened tube f is wound up around paper reel g as a flat
tube. When the blown film is to be used as a flat film, the
width of flattened tube f is slit into a desired number of
sheets and wound up around the respective paper reel g' held
by reel holder 23. The terminology "blow-up ratio" as used in
blown-film extrusion means a ratio of a final inner diameter
of a blown tube to an outer diameter of a ring die.
Thermoplastic resins are generally inflated at a blow-up ratio
of from 1.2 to 4.In

A process for producing a blown film of a
thermoplastic resin by blown film extrusion, comprising

blowing air into an extruded bubble of resin extruded from a
ring die to expand the bubble and cooling the expanded bubble

with air from an air cooling ring, wherein said cooling is
carried out by using a cooling apparatus provided on the

downstream side of the air cooling ring, comprising a
plurality of rectifying cylinders having different diameters

arrayed at certain intervals in the radial direction
concentrically with the ring die to form a ring air chamber

with its downstream end open between each two adjacent
cylinders, wherein the outermost rectifying cylinder has a

plurality of intake vents for intake of open air in a radial
manner at a position clo
ser to the air cooling ring than to
the downstream end of said outermost rectifying cylinder, and

the remaining rectifying cylinders each have a vent in the
region of the bottom end (upstream end) thereof so that the

air chambers are ventilated, with the height of the rectifying
cylinders gradually increasing toward the outermost one so

that the downstream ends of the cylinders form a tapered guide
for the bubble, characterized in that said blown film

extrusion is carried out under such conditions that the ratio
of (b) the final diameter of the expanded bubble to (a) the

diameter of the bubble at the crystallizing temperature of the
thermoplastic resin ((b)/(a)) ranges from 1.5 to 10 and that

the position of said diameter (a) at the crystallizing
temperature of the bubble will be upstream of the downstream

end of the outermost rectifying cylinder, and that the blown
film produced is orientated.

((b)/(a)) is from 2 to 8.

comprising two upright ducts arrayed concentrically with the

passageway formed between the inner and outer ducts.
