<CLAIMS>
An additional module for a watch movement, characterized in that it 
includes a central mechanism plate and at least two different mechanisms 

placed one on each side of this plate and in that one of the mechanisms 
and the plate, exhibits through bores allowing the placement 

of the drive axes for the display means of the other mechanism. 
A module according to claim 1, characterized in that the two mechanisms 
are driven from a same power source. 
A module according to claim 1, characterized in that each mechanism 
is driven from a different power source. 
A module according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the central plate is formed of two layers of an identical material 

or of different materials exhibiting different physical characteristics. 
A watch which is mechanically or quartz driven, characterized in 
that it includes at least one module according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

mounted on, at least, one of the faces of the movement. 
A watch according to claim 5, characterized in that it includes, at 
least, one module according to one of claims 1 to 4, mounted on each 

face of the movement. 
A watch according to claim 6, characterized in that the mechanisms 
drive coaxial display means. 
A watch according to claim 6, characterized in that the mechanisms  
 

drive noncoaxial display means.
