insecticidally effective amount of certain N'-substituted-N,N'-diacylhydrazines having 

the formula 

wherein:
 

   X is phenyl, 2-fluorophenyl, or phenyl or 2-fluorophenyl substituted at the 
4-position with chloro, fluoro, iodo, methyl or ethyl; and

 
   Y is phenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl or phenyl substituted at the 

2-position with chloro, bromo or iodo.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method of controlling the larvae or 
grub of insects, for example in turfgrass, ornamental plants or food crops, using an 
insecticidally effective amount of certain N'-substituted-N,N'-diacylhydrazines. The search for compounds which have a combination of excellent insecticidal 
activity towards target insects and low toxicity towards non-target species is a 
continuing one because of factors such as the desire for compounds exhibiting 
greater activity, better selectivity, lower undesirable environmental impact, lack of 
phytotoxicity to the locus of application, lower production and market cost, and 
higher effectiveness against insects resistant to may known insecticides. In 
particular, there exists a need for effective control of Coleopteran larvae (grubs) in 
turfgrass, ornamental plants and food crops. Commercial insecticides, for example 
chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, acephate, isofenphos, isazophos, diazinon, ethoprop and 
bendiocarb, have serious deficiencies such as requiring a high application rate to be 
effective, possessing undesirable mammalian/avian toxicity, having poor soil 
mobility, and/or being toxic to beneficial soil animals such as spiders, ants and 
earthworms. Although the economic value of the turfgrass industry is difficult to estimate, 
primarily because much turfgrass acreage is not grown for sale, turfgrass culture in 
its entirety as an industry contributes significantly to the economy. In the United 
States, for example, the production, service and maintenance of turfgrass amounts to 
billions of dollars annually. Protection of existing turfgrass plantings from various 
pests, including insects, is thus an important concern. Coleopteran pests are widespread in their habitat. The northern masked 
chafer, Cyclocephala borealis Arrow, and the southern masked chafer, C. immaculata 
(Olivier), are native to the United States and are distributed over a wide area east of 
the Rocky Mountains. May or June beetles, both Phyllophaga spp. Harris, and the 
oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis Waterhouse, occur throughout Canada and the 
United States, particularly the eastern half of the United States. The European 
chafer, Rhizotrogus (Amphimallon) majalis (Razoumowsky), is most problematic in the 
northeastern United States and in Canada. The cupreous chafer, Anomala cuprea, is a 
particular problem for crops and turfgrass in Japan. In the grub stage, the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, is 
undoubtedly the single most important
