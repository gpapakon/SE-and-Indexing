<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element for making
improved offset printing plates according to the silver salt
diffusion transfer process. Furthermore the present invention
relates to a method for making improved offset printing plates with
said imaging element.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image receiving layer and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background. The DTR-image can be formed in the image
receiving layer of a sheet or web material which is a separate
element with respect to the photographic silver halide emulsion
material (a so-called two-sheet DTR element) or in the image
receiving layer of a so-called single-support-element, also called
mono-sheet element, which contains at least one photographic silver
halide emulsion layer integral with an image receiving layer in
waterpermeable relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet
version which is preferred for the preparation of offset printing
plates by the DTR method.Two types of the mono-sheet DTR offset printing plate exist. 
According to a first type disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,722,535 and GB-1,241,661
a support is provided in the order given with a silver
halide emulsion layer and a layer containing physical development
nuclei serving as the image-receiving layer. After information-wise
exposure and development the imaged element is used as a printing
plate without the removal of the emulsion layer. This type of
printing plates has a low printing endurance, typically around 10000
copies.According to a second type of mono-sheet DTR offset printing
plate a hydrophilic support, mostly

<CLAIMS>
An imaging element comprising in the order given (i) a
hydrophilic base, (ii) an image receiving layer containing physical

development nuclei, (iii) a photosensitive layer containing a silver
halide emulsion being in water permeable relationship with said

image receiving layer and (iv) optionally an intermediate layer
between said image receiving layer and said photosensitive layer,

said intermediate layer comprising a non-proteinic hydrophilic
film-forming polymer or hydrophobic polymer beads having an average

diameter not lower than 0.2 µm and having been prepared by
polymerization of a ethylenically unsaturated monomer, characterized

in that at least one layer contains at least one fluorine containing
surfactant.
An imaging element according to claim 1 wherein said fluorine
containing surfactant is a surfactant with a C

10
 perfluorinated
alkyl group.
An imaging element according to claim 2, wherein said surfactant

-C
10
 perfluorinated alkyl group is of the nonionic or of
the anionic type.
An imaging element according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
concentration of the fluorine containing surfactant in a layer is

comprised between 0.2 % and 15 % by weight versus the total dry
weight of the layer.
An imaging element according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein at
least said photosensitive layer and/or said optional intermediate

layer contains at least one fluorine containing surfactant.
An imaging element according to any of claims 1 to 5, comprising
at least one layer containing at least one non-fluorine containing

surfactant, said layer comprising either or not at least one

(a) image-wise exposing an imaging element according to any of
claims 1 to 6,
(b) applying an aqueous alkaline solution to the imaging element in
the presence of (a) developing agent(s) and (a) silver halide

solvent(s) to form a silver image in said photosensitive layer and
to allow unreduced silver halide or complexes formed thereof to

diffuse image-wise from the photosensitive layer to said image
receiving layer to produce therein a silver image,
(c) treating the imaging element to remove the layer(s) on top of
said image receiving layer, thereby uncovering said silver image

formed in said image receiving layer.
