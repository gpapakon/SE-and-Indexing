<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thread dispensing device, especially for a retraction thread 10 which can be unwound in predetermined lengths from a storage roll 14 rotatably mounted in a housing 12, can be severed on emergence from the housing 12 by means of a cutting device 18 and which is guided in the housing 12 for emergence with transportation by a drive unit 20 which comprises at least one drive roller 22. The facts that the first drive roller 22 interacts with a second drive roller 24 which in turn interacts with a third drive roller 26 and that the drive rollers are provided with gear rims 28, 30, 32 for interaction of the drive rollers 22, 24, 26, the gear rims engaging with each other from the first drive roller 22 to the third drive roller 26 arranged one behind the other in a row, result in a thread dispensing device that permits simple, quick one-handed operation and clean, germ-free and obstruction-free transportation of the treatment thread whose length can moreover be accurately metered.
