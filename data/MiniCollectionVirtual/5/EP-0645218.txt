<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tool shaft (shank) for rotating tools having at least two diametrically opposite slots extending in the axial direction for receiving rotational drivers and/or locking elements of a mechanical torque-transmitting device. For such a tool shaft to fit not only into a receptacle, adapted for it, of a very specific machine system, but also to be universally insertable into various machine types, the invention proposes that all of the slots open out at the end of the shaft and that the flanks of at least two diametrically opposite slots have a hollow-cylindrical bevel within a section which is axially bounded in both directions and always ends at a distance from the shaft end.
