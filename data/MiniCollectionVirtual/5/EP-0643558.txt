<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to microbicidal compositions for
sanitizing food contact surfaces, and for disinfecting
critical day-care and health-care environments. More
specifically, the invention relates to food additive
microbicidal compositions which includes an octanoic acid
antimicrobial agent and which are preferably safe for
incidental human contact as well as food contact surfaces
without requiring a post-sanitizing rinse. The
microbicidal compositions of the invention are suitable for
dairy farms, food and beverage processing plants, food
preparation kitchens, food serving establishments, child-care,
nursing-care and hospital-care applications, as well
as for general utility in domestic households.The list of approved microbicidal agents has decreased
due to their human toxicity and their detrimental effect on
water supplies and the environment. Improving analytical
capabilities to detect parts-per-billion levels in food,
water and in the environment have raised important safety
concerns about the application and misapplication of these
chemicals. These issues have resulted in the banning of
some antimicrobials, for example hexachlorophene; the
retesting of others for animal toxicity, such as, the
quaternary ammonium compounds; and, the increasing scrutiny
of microbicidal species such as chlorine or hypochlorites
which may form toxic halocarbons in effluent waters.There has been a long felt need for antimicrobial
agents which have a high degree of antimicrobial efficacy, 
and which are preferably safely ingestible by humans while
posing no environmental incompatibility. Those
antimicrobial agents which are lethal to microorganisms,
however, are also toxic in varying degrees to humans and
animals in that both higher and lower forms of life share
at least some metabolic pathways. Competitive inhibition,
non-competitive inhibition, protein coagulation, oxidative
and reductive action, blockage of enzyme systems are
thought to be some of the mechanisms involved in the
destruction of microorganisms.Differentiation of antimicrobial "-cidal" or "-static"
activity, the definitions which describe the degree of
efficacy, and the official laboratory protocols for
measuring this efficacy are important considerations for
understanding the relevance of antimicrobial agents and
compositions. Antimicrobial compositions may effect two
kinds of microbial cell damage. The first is a truly
lethal, irreversible action resulting in complete microbial
cell destruction or incapacitation. The second type of
cell damage is
