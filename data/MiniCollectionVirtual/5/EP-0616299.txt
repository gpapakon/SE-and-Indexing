<ABSTRACT>
After a character key provided on a keyboard has 
been operated to input a text, it is determined using a 

cut-mark key or the like whether or not a cut mark exists. 
If it is determined that the cut mark exists, the position 

for printing the cut mark can be set on a liquid crystal 
display based on width data extending from an upper end of 

a tape. Then, the cut mark is printed on the tape 
together with a text in a text memory, based on the cut 

mark whose position has been set, thereby producing a tape 
with characters applied thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printer 
capable of printing a text such as characters input via a 
keyboard on an elongated tape to thereby produce the tape 
with the characters printed thereon and, more particularly, 
to a tape printer that is capable of printing a cut 
mark used as a standard for cutting a tape at a desired 
position on the tape and producing, depending on the 
purpose, a tape with characters that is formed in a 
desired width size. A tape printer has heretofore been proposed, 
wherein a plurality of kinds of tape cassettes with tapes 
having mutually-different tape widths incorporated therein 
can be selectively used, and a tape cassette with a tape 
having a desired tape width incorporated therein is 
selected from the plurality of kinds of tape cassettes to 
thereby produce a tape with characters printed thereon. In this type of tape printer, an operator prepares 
a tape cassette with a tape incorporated therein, which 
has a width nearest the width of a tape with characters to 
be produced and sets the prepared tape cassette to the 
tape printer so as to print characters or the like on the 
tape, thereby producing the tape with the characters 
printed thereon. However, the widths of the tapes incorporated into 
the respective tape cassettes are classified into several 
types (about five) alone. Therefore, the intended tape 
having the width coincident with the desired width of the 
tape that the operator attempts to produce, is very few. 
In contrast with this, the tape having the width coincident 
with the desired tape width is hardly found under the 
present condition. A problem arises where the tape referred to above 
does not exist in the tapes. That is, characters or the 
like are first printed on a tape having a width greater  
 
than a desired tape width to thereby produce the tape with 
the characters printed thereon. It is thereafter necessary 
to cut the produced tape with scissors or the like so 
as to have a desired tape width. Thus, since the conventional 
tape printer does not have a function for printing 
a cut mark used as a standard for cutting the tape, it is 
difficult to cut the tape in a desired tape width, thus 
creating difficulties in producing the tape with the 
characters, which tape has the desired tape width. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a tape printer capable of printing a cut mark 
used as a standard for cutting a tape at a desired position 
on the tape and producing, depending on the purpose, 
a tape with
