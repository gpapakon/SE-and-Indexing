pattern having a good shape, has so high acid resistance

as to be easily dissolved in a stripping 

solution consisting of an organoalkali. Said composition 
comprises (1) 100 parts by weight of an alkali-soluble 

novolak resin having a polystyrene reduced 
weight average molecular weight of 1,000 to 10,000, (2) 

1 to 10 parts by weight of a compound having a methylol 
group and/or an alkoxymethyl group and being capable of

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a radiation
sensitive resin composition useful as a negative type
resist for producing a liquid crystal display device.As a resist to be used in the lithographic
process for producing a liquid crystal display element,
there have heretofore been broadly adopted a positive
type resist using a novolak resin and a quinonediazide
compound and a negative type resist using a cyclized
rubber and a bisazide radiation sensitive compound.However, in the case of producing, for
example, a liquid crystal display element, the
proportion of the area of the wiring portion to the
whole area of a substrate is small (namely, the portion
remaining as a resist pattern is small), so that the
positive type resist is disadvantageous in being liable
to undergo the influence of dust. Therefore, the
negative type resist is more advantageous. However, a
conventional negative type resist using a cyclized
rubber and a bisazide radiation sensitive compound
requires an organic solvent as a developer, and hence,
has such a problem that the working atmosphere is
deteriorated. Thus, a difficulty has accompanied the
application thereof to the production of a liquid
crystal display element or the like on a commercial 
scale. Thus, a growing interest has recently been taken
in a negative type resist developable with an alkali
developer.As a negative type resist composition to be used for
a semiconductor, there is known a composition comprising
a novolak resin, a cross-linking agent and triazine
compound as stated in EP-A-048325.EP-A-0483693 discloses the use of a coloured resin composition in the
manufacture of coloured images which are permanently included in the colour
elements of a liquid crystal display device.Also, in the lithographic process for
producing a liquid crystal display element or the like,
the surface of a substrate on which a resist pattern has
been formed is treated by a chemical etching, an electrolytic
etching or the like and then the resist pattern
is dissolved in a stripping solution consisting of an
organoalkali. Even in the case of a negative type
resist, however, there has been strongly desired the
development of a resist which can form a pattern having
a good shape, has a high adhesion to the substrate and
so high acid resistance as not to be affected by an
etchant, and is endowed with so high a strippability as
to be easily dissolved in a stripping solution.The object of this invention is to provide a novel
process for production of a liquid crystal display device
using a
