 TΓΓLEHYDROGENATION OF ENZYMATICALLY-PRODUCEDGLYOXYLIC ACID/AMINOMETHYL-PHOSPHONIC ACID MIXTURESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention:This invention relates to the preparation of N-(phosphonomethyl)- glycine by the hydrogenation of mixtures produced by the reaction of glycohc acid and oxygen in an aqueous solution containing aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and the enzymes glycolate oxidase ((S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase, EC 1.1.3.15) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6). N-(p__osphonomethyl)glyc_ne is a broad-spectrum, postemergent herbicide useful in controlling the growth of a wide variety of plants.2. Description of the Related Art:Glycolate oxidase, an enzyme commonly found in leafy green plants and mammalian cells, catalyzes the oxidation of glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid, with the concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide:HOCH2C02H + 02 -»> OCHC02H + H202N. E. Tolbert et al., J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 181, 905-914 (1949) first reported an enzyme, extracted from tobacco leaves, which catalyzed the oxidation of glycohc acid to formic acid and C02 via the intermediate formation of glyoxylic acid. The addition of certain compounds, such as ethylenediamine, limited the further oxidation of the intermediate glyoxylic acid. The oxidations were carried out at a pH of about 8, typically using glycolic acid concentrations of about 3-40 mM (millimolar). The optimum pH for the glycolate oxidation was reported to be 8.9.Oxalic acid (100 mM) was reported to inhibit the catalytic action of the glycolate oxidase. Similarly, K. E. Richardson and N. E. Tolbert, J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 236, 1280-1284 (1961) showed that buffers containing tris(hydroxymethyl)amino- methane (TRIS) inhibited the formation of oxalic acid in the glycolate oxidase catalyzed oxidation of glycohc acid. C. O. Clagett, N. E. Tolbert and R. H. Burris, J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 178, 977-987 (1949) reported that the optimum pH for the 

 glycolate oxidase catalyzed oxidation of glycolic acid with oxygen was about 7.8 - 8.6, and the optimum temperature was 35-40°C.I. Zelitch and S. Ochoa, J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 201, 707-718 (1953), and J. C. Robinson et al.. J. Biol. Chem.. Vol.237, 2001-2009 (1962), reported that the formation of formic acid and CC»2 in the spinach glycolate oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of glycolic acid resulted from the nonenzymatic reaction of H2O2 with glyoxylic acid. They observed that addition of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2, greatly improved the yields of glyoxylic acid by suppressing the formation of
