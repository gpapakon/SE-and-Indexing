<ABSTRACT>
To provide equipment for continuously annealing a steel strip which has been cold-rolled, intended to stably operate an annealing 
furnace by preventing the slip of bridle rolls and hearth rolls. The diameter D of bridle rolls (2) is set so that a surface 

pressure 
p
 expressed by the equation 

p = h(σ1 + σ2)/D 
 
 becomes not lower than 10 kPa (kilopascal); wherein σ1 is unit tension of 

the portion of a steel strip (1) which is on the upstream side of bridle rolls (2) and hearth rolls (3) in a furnace; σ2 unit tension of 
the portion of the steel strip (1) which is on the downstream side of the rolls (2, 3); 
h
 the thickness of the steel strip; and D the 
diameter of the bridle rolls (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
continuously annealing a steel strip after cold rolling,
wherein the term "steel strip" refers to steel products
ultimately applicable to production of cans, steel furniture,
automobiles, etc. after continuous annealing, and, if
necessary, tin plating, zinc plating, etc.Generally, the higher the tension of a steel strip in
the furnace in an apparatus for continuous annealing, the
better from the viewpoint of preventing walk or fluttering
on one hand, and the lower the tension, the better from the
viewpoint of preventing heat buckle.To satisfy such contradicting requirements, it is an
ordinary operating practice to decrease the tension of steel
strip in a heating furnace or a soaking furnace where the steel
strip is at a high temperature and increase the tension in
a cooling furnace or an overaging furnace where the steel
strip is at a relative low temperature.Such tension distribution can be obtained by finely
adjusting and controlling a hearth roll speed, and when it
is desired to change the tension radically at a position in
the furnace, it is an ordinary practice to provide a bridle
roll in the furnace.Fig. 1 shows one example of that practice, where sets
of hearth rolls 3 are so arranged in the individual furnaces
as to guide a steel strip 1 into the individual furnaces from
the inlet side to the outlet side and a set of bridle rolls 
2 is arranged just before a rapid cooling furnace 6 in which the
steel strip 1 that has passed through a heating furnace 4
and a soaking pit 5 is to be exposed to a gas jet stream of
a high speed, and the tension of the steel strip 1 becomes
largest after passing through the set of bridle rolls 2.
Then, the steel strip 1 passes through the successive quenching
furnace 6, an overaging furnace 7 and a final cooling furnace
8 under the largest tension.A set of bridle rolls 2 and sets of hearth rolls 3 provided
for these purposes must surely restrict the steel strip 1
so as to prevent any slip. Actually, the bridle rolls 2 and
hearth rolls 3 have often slipped, particularly when the
thickness of steel strip becomes smaller, and have failed
to perform their proper functions.An object of the present invention is to solve these
problems and to provide a process for continuously annealing
a steel strip, capable of performing functions of bridle rolls
and heath rolls so satisfactorily as to attain the stable
operation of the apparatus for annealing.To solve the above-mentioned problems, the present
invention provides a process as
