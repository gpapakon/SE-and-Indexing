<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a network facsimile
apparatus capable of performing transmission and reception of
facsimile data and e-mail data connecting to a PSTN and a
network such as the internet or LAN.Recently, it has been performed to connect a personal
computer, work station, FAX server or the like to a network
in order to transmit and receive an e-mail and facsimile and
to browse homepages.FIG.1 illustrates a system structure of the case of
performing facsimile transmission and reception using a FAX
server. The reception operation at a client machine (personal
computer) will be described next. FAX modem 1001 receives a
call from the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and
fetches image data to transmit to FAX server 1002. FAX server
software operating at FAX server 1002 receives the image data,
and stores the image data as an image data file at file server
1003 through the network. At this point, the storage of
facsimile received data is finished.To fetch the received image data into client machine 1004,
a user starts a dedicated application at client machine 1004
and reads out the image data from file server 1003 through the
network.Further, a method of reusing facsimile received data by
combining an internet FAX and a WWW server has been recently
proposed. The method utilizes the function of the internet
FAX which converts data received from the PSTN into an e-mail.FIG.2 illustrates a system structure of the case of
performing facsimile transmission and reception using an
internet FAX and a WWW server. The reception operation at the
client machine will be described. Image data received at internet FAX 1101 via the PSTN
is converted into an attached file format to an e-mail at
internet FAX 1101 and is transmitted to WWW server 1103 as an
attached file of e-mail.The e-mail with the attached file transferred from
internet FAX 1101 is received at e-mail server 1102 via a
network. The e-mail with the attached file received at e-mail
server 1102 is transferred to WWW server 1103 that is a
destination again via the network.WWW server 1103 stores the attached file of e-mail as
image data to link to a homepage for facsimile reception. The
storage of facsimile received data is finished at this point.In order to fetch received data into client machine 1104,
a user starts a WWW browser at client machine 1104 and accesses
to the homepage for facsimile reception at WWW server 1103.
The user reads out an image data file at client machine 1104
via the network from WWW server 1103.However, in the
