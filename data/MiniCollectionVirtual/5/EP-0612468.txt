<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for keeping poultry. 
The device comprises cages (10) which are disposed one above the other 

inside 
a building. The cages (10) are provided with belts (5,12) which are 

movable in the 
longitudinal direction of the cages (10). Air ducts (6) are located 

under the 
movable belts (5). Via the air ducts (6) pressurized air from an air 

conditioning 
plant (24) can be supplied to the cages (10). Means are provided by 

which the air 
flowing from the cages (10) can be discharged from the building, all this 

in 
such a manner that a certain overpressure can be maintained inside the 

building. The belts (5) form suitable floors for taken up litter. 
The belts (5) 

are evenly perforated over at least substantially their entire effective 
surface forming the floors. The bottoms of the air ducts (6) located 

below 
the belts are made up of closed belts (12) which are movable in the 

longitudinal 
direction of the cages (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for keeping poultry, 
provided with a building and with cages disposed one above the other inside 
the building, whereby the cages are provided with belts which are movable 
in the longitudinal direction of the cages, whilst air ducts are located 
under said belts, via which pressurized air from an air conditioning plant 
can be supplied to the cages, and means are provided by which the air 
flowing from the cages can be discharged from the building, all this in 
such a manner that a certain overpressure can be maintained inside the 
building. Such a device is known from EP-A-0047043. In this known device the floor of the cage is made up 
of a fixedly disposed wire grid, on which the poultry moves around. Such 
wire grid floors are less suitable, in particular for rearing poultry. 
Endless conveyor belts are furthermore disposed under the wire grid floors 
in this known device, in such a manner that the spaced-apart upper and 
lower parts of the conveyor belts bound air ducts. From these air ducts 
pressurized air can flow along the outer edges of the upper parts of the 
conveyor belts, whereby the pressure of the pressurized air must be 
sufficiently high for forcing the outer edges of the upper parts of the 
belts away from strips supporting said outer edges. Baffle plates are 
thereby provided above the edges of the upper parts of the conveyor 
belts, in order to achieve that the air flowing from the air ducts 
transversely to the longitudinal direction of the upper parts of the belts 
is slightly deflected towards the centre of the grid floors again. A combination of conveyor belts bounding air chambers 
and grid floors located some distance thereabove leads to a construction 
which takes up a comparatively great deal of space, whilst furthermore 
it is not possible to realize a uniform distribution of the air over the 
grid floor. From EP-A-0088500 poultry cages are known wherein the 
floors of the cages are made up of perforated belts, which can be moved 
to and fro. Endless conveyor belts are disposed under said belts, in order 
to carry away manure and the like falling through the belts. Said 
publication does not provide any indication whatever with regard to the  
 
supplying of fresh air to the cages, which is essential to keeping the 
animals in optimal health condition. From NL-A-8902177 a building for rearing poultry is 
furthermore known, wherein a fixedly disposed loadbearing floor is provided 
some distance above a concrete floor of the building. Air is

<CLAIMS>
A device for keeping poultry, provided with a 
building (21) and with cages disposed one above the other inside the 

building (21), whereby the cages are provided with belts (5) which are 
movable in the longitudinal direction of the cages, whilst air ducts 

are located under said belts, via which pressurized air from an air 
conditioning plant can be supplied to the cages, and means are provided 

by which the air flowing from the cages can be discharged from the building 
(21), all this in such a manner that a certain overpressure can be 

maintained inside the building (21), characterized in that the belts (5) 
for taking up litter form suitable cage floors, whereby the belts (5) 

are evenly perforated over at least substantially their entire effective 
surface forming the floors, whilst the bottoms of the air ducts (6) located 

below the belts (5) are made up of closed belts (12), which are movable 
in the longitudinal direction of the cages. 
A device according claim 1, characterized in that 
several separated cages (10) are disposed one behind the other, said cages 

(10) being separated from each other by cross walls (8), which can be 
displaced in such a manner, that an open communication may be provided 

between the successive cages (10). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the belts (5) forming the floors of the cages (10) are supported 

by grids (4). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the belts (5) forming the floors of the cages 

(10) are belts, in which holes are provided in regularly spaced-apart 
relationship. 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said belts (5, 12) can be wound on rollers 

(13, 14) disposed near one end of said cages (10). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a vertically movable discharge conveyor (15) 

is disposed near one end of said cages (10). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that air to be exhausted from the building (21)  

 
is passed through a heat exchanger (24), in order to heat fresh air to 

be supplied to the building (21), before the air to be discharged is 
released into the atmosphere.
