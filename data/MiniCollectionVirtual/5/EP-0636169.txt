<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing viscoelastic, thixotropic, liquid, polymer-containing detergent compositions which exhibit increased density, enhanced aesthetics and improved rheological efficiency of the polymer is provided. The polymer thixotropic thickening agent is simultaneously added and mixed as a slurry to a premix under moderate to high shear rate to neutralize and disperse the polymer. The product is deaerated to increase density and enhance aesthetics by continued mixing under low to moderate shear rate of the slurry/premix composition. Sequential addition and mixing to the slurry/premix of organic solvent, oil, suds suppressors and solid material can aid in the deaeration step.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR PREPARING THIXOTROPIC LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITIONSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a process for making stable viscoelastic, thixotropic, liqu.id polymer-containing detergent compositions which exhibit increased density, enhanced aesthetics, and good rheological efficiency of the polymer. The process comprises adding and mixing a polymeric thickener slurry simultaneously with a premix of other detergent ingredients until a desired viscosity has been achieved, this step is followed by deaeration of the mixture by mixing. The slurry is simultaneously added to the premix at high shear for a sufficient period of time to disperse and neutralize the polymer without redestructing the polymer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Because of their convenience, dispensing characteristics and aesthetics, liquid and/or gel detergent compositions are becoming an increasingly popular alternative to granular compositions among consumers. However, liquid and/or gel formulations often do not deliver the same effective performance as a granular composition. To clean effectively, liquid/gel and granular detergent compositions contain chlorine bleach and have high alkalinity (i.e. silicate, carbonate and caustic). See, for example, U.S. Patents 4,116,849, Leikhim, issued September 26, 1978, 5,064,553, Dixit et al, issued November 12, 1991 and 4,917,812, Cilley, issued April 17, 1990. Automatic dishwashing detergentâ€¢compositions have been disclosed which use enzymes in place of chlorine bleach, for example, U.S. Patents 4,162,987, Maguire et 

al, issued July 31, 1979 and 4,101,457, Place et al , issued July 18, 1978.Liquid automatic dishwashing detergent compositions and processes have been disclosed to address the problems associated with rheology and other physical characteristics. See for example U.S. Patents 5,075,027, Dixit et al , issued December 24, 1991, 4,824,590, Roselle, issued April 25, 1989, and 4,740,327, Julemont et al, issued April 26, 1988.It has been found that a viscoelastic, thixotropic, liquid, polymer-containing detergent composition can be formed with increased density, enhanced aesthetics and improved rheological efficiency of the polymer. Surprisingly, the simultaneous addition and mixing of a polymer slurry to a premix of detergent ingredients at moderate to high shear rate to neutralize and disperse the polymer, followed by deaeration of the resulting mixture yields a composition which has an increased density, enhanced aesthetics and a stable polymeric thixotropic thickener.
