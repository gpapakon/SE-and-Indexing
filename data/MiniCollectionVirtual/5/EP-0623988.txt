<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical machine whose external rotor (1) is mounted rotatably on a stator (3), at least one cooling jacket (9) through which cooling fluid flows being arranged in the interior of the stator (3) and the stator (3) having at least one cooling duct (8) radially further inwards, through which a circulating internal cooling medium, preferably air, flows. Such an electrical machine has considerably improved cooling.

Electrical machine, the external rotor (1) of 
which is rotatably mounted on a stator (3), with the 

stator having a cooling duct which is loaded with a 
coolant and the external rotor having fan blades (6), 

characterised in that radially beneath its laminated 
stator core (5), the stator (3) has a cooling jacket 

(9), through which cooling fluid flows and which has at 
least one supply line (10) and at least one discharge 

line (11) for the cooling fluid, and in that a 
circulating internal coolant flows through a cooling 

duct (8) of the stator (3), which cooling duct is 
provided further inside.
