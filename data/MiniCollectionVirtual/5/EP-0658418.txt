<ABSTRACT>
Diffractive lenses having gradial zones (62, 70, 78, 90, 98, 106, 114) are formed 
by separately, sequentially spin casting and polymerizing successive radial zones of the 

lens to produce optical phase differences of 2π between adjacent gradial zones.
 

Diffractive lenses may be molded in plano-plano( 60), plano-concave (68) and plano-convex 
(76) geometries and also may be combined with conventional plano-plano (84), 

convex-convex (92), plano-concave (100) and plano-convex (108) refractive lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns lenses and methods for making lenses. More particularly, 
the invention relates to lenses or groups of lenses having not only plano or conventional 
curved refractive surfaces, but also an internal or attached diffractive element. The relatively new field of diffractive optics has yielded applications in infrared 
cameras, endoscopes, intraocular lenses, ultraviolet sensors, microlens arrays and printer 
scanning lenses. These lenses exhibit improved performance over optical systems that 
utilize only refractive or reflective surfaces. As a consequence, sometimes the number of 
lens elements can be reduced, thereby providing savings in weight and manufacturing 
cost. Diffractive optics employs a surface relief pattern of wavelength dimensions to 
control the wavefront distribution in much the same manner as a diffraction grating. 
Methods for depositing such surface reliefs are by photolithography (referred to as binary 
optics), diamond turning, laser machining or holographic techniques. Diffractive zones 
are usually deposited as thin substrates onto planar surfaces in concentric patterns. 
Individual zonal minutiae have structural dimensions of tens of microns, appearing 
sometimes as a series of discrete steps, in order to give high diffraction efficiency. Such known types of diffractive elements require the use of complex, expensive 
equipment for their manufacture and are difficult to make. Moreover, the known 
photolithographic manufacturing processes require that the diffractive elements be 
provided on flat surfaces, particularly for binary optics, which limits their application. 
Also, the known diamond turning processes, to be used on previously formed lenses, 
require precision fixturing to secure the existing lens during turning. The invention is defined by the appended claims. However, one embodiment 
comprises concentric cylindrical layers of one or more transparent materials that are 
individually spin cast and at least partially cured in a disk shaped mold with flat, curved 
or a combination of flat and curved surfaces. A suitable apparatus for making such lenses 
is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,244,371. Each layer of material is 
cured before a microliter volume for the next layer is injected into the mold. Successive 
layers should have essentially equal cross sectional areas, as measured in a plane normal 
to the axis of the lens. Successive concentric layers may be formed from materials which, 
when cured, have different indices of

A method of making a diffractive lens, comprising the steps of: 
   providing a mold having an axis and a mold cavity symmetrically surrounding the 

axis, the cavity having a desired geometry for at least one exterior surface of the 
diffractive lens; 

   spinning the mold about the axis; 
   injecting a first volume of optically transparent material into the cavity during the 

spinning, thereby placing the first volume at a periphery of the cavity to define a radially 
outer zone of the diffractive lens; 

   curing the first volume within the outer zone to at least partially solidify the 
material; 

   injecting a second volume of optically transparent material into the cavity during 
the spinning, thereby placing the second volume against an inner periphery of the outer 

zone to define a first radially inner zone of the diffractive lens; 
   curing the second volume within the first inner zone to at least partially solidify 

the material; and 
   repeating the injecting and curing steps to define and cure subsequent inner zones 

of the diffractive lens until the mold cavity is filled with concentric zones of cured 
material. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the material is a polymer and the curing is 
achieved by subjecting the volumes of polymer to radiation to polymerize the monomer. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the index of refraction of the cured 
material is different in adjacent zones of the diffractive lens.
