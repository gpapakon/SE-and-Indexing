<ABSTRACT>
A periscopic sight (11, 13, 14) is mounted to extend 
through the wall of protective armour (23) surrounding a 

gun station. An elevation mirror (11) is exposed to receive 
light from the direction in which the gun is pointing and to 

reflect the light along a vertical path extending through the 
sight. A sealed unitary lens system (13) has a lens axis 

aligned with the vertical path and conducts the light thereÂ­
through to a stationary mirror (14) accessible to the eye 

(16) of an observer. 
The sealed unitary lens systems has a sufficiently long 
eye relief to provide an unobstructed image to the observer 

in spite of the placement of the stationary mirror (14) 
between the lens system (13) and the observer (16).
