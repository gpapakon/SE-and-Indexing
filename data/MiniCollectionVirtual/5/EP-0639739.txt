<CLAIMS>
Pipe clamp for holding assembly component comprising a 
centred cutout formed by two shanks which are moveable 

relative to each other, and an elastic insert (2) of essentially U-shaped 
cross-section, the base area (3) of which reaches 

around the assembly component, and the side areas (4) of 
which reach around the pipe clamp (1), and the side of the base 

area (3) oriented towards the assembly component is at least 
partially provided with a friction-reducing coating (7), 


characterised in that
 the friction-reducing coating (7) is a flock-coating. 
Pipe Clamp according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
flocks of the flock-coating are made of polyester fibres. 
Pipe Clamp according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 
the portions of the base area (3) which have been provided with 

a flock-coating are protrusions (6) oriented towards the centre. 
Pipe Clamp according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the 
protrusions (6) are arranged to be webs extending parallel with 

the longitudinal extent of the insert (2).
