<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel azo dye
compounds, inks separately containing such azo dye
compounds as a recording agent, and an ink-jet recording
method and an instrument using such an ink. More
particularly, this invention relates to novel azo dye
compounds suitable for use in the preparation of inks
which can provide images high in optical density, scarcely
cause feathering of dots and permit fast fixing and
improved water fastness when printed on so-called
plain paper such as woodfree paper, paper for copying,
bond paper and paper for reporting, inks separately
containing such dye compounds, and an ink-jet recording
method and an instrument using such an ink.Water-based inks with a water-soluble dye dissolved
in an aqueous medium have heretofore been used as inks for
ink-jet recording. Such conventional inks are required to
satisfy the following conditions:
(1) providing images sufficient in optical density;(2) having good drying characteristics on a
recording material; (3) providing recorded images on which feathering
scarcely occurs;(4) providing recorded images free from running even
when coming into contact with water, alcohol, etc., or
sufficiently readable even when run out (high water
fastness);(5) providing recorded images excellent in light
fastness:(6) causing no clogging on the tip of a pen or
nozzle;(7) having no defects such as blurring of recorded
images upon continuous recording or resumption of
recording after left over for a long period of time (good
ejection stability);(8) being able to store stably;(9) offering no problem even when coming into
contact with parts constructing a recording means during
use; and(10) offering no problem about the safety of users.
In addition, in an ink-jet recording system making use of
thermal energy, the inks are required to satisfy the
following conditions:(11) having excellent heat resistance and not
adversely affecting a means for generating thermal energy.These properties or characteristics may of course
vary according to the composition of ink, and also are 
greatly controlled by the nature of a dye contained as a
recording agent. It is difficult to satisfy all the above
requirements for performance by using existing dyes.The conventional water-based inks for ink-jet
recording have used principally existing acid or direct
dyes. These dyes each have a sulfonic group as a
solubilizing group, and hence are high in solubility in
media for water-based inks, and hence, the long-term
storability of inks containing such a dye is generally
good.
