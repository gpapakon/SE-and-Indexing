<ABSTRACT>
A holder for infusion administering catheter devices which comprise a 
head portion and a catheter portion, is formed as deformable band, having 

a first portion configured to overlie the device in its administered position 
onto a patient's arm without obstructing access to its functional parts, and 

a second portion adapted to surround the arm portion of the patient and 
become tightened over the said first portion by releasable attaching means. 

In an embodiment the holder is made of an elastic material, such as 
silicone rubber or a BVS K-Resin. The releasable attaching means may be 

VELCRO or core fasteners, such as mushrooms fasteners.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical appliances, and more particularly 
to a holder for securing infusion administrating catheters onto patient Infusion administrating catheter devies are conventionally formed of two 
main portions - see Fig. 1- namely the head portion generally indicated 
at 10, and an elongated, flexible syringe needle sheath portion indicated at 
12. The head portion comprises a double wing-like base 14, an inlet socket 
portion 16 for the plasma or other medical substance which is to be 
administered to the patient, and the venting branch 18 having an openable 
cover 20 which is connected to the branch 18 by a wire 22. These constructional features of the administering catheter are standard 
and need not be further described. It is a common practice in hospitals to attach the administering catheter 
10 to the patient's arm or other limb portion, after insertion of a syringe 
(metal) needle into the vein (not shown), by a common medical adhesive 
tape. This primitive method of attaching the catheter has been used now 
for decades in spite of various disadvantages thereof, particularly the fact 
that every time that the catheter has to be removed, the adhesive tape 
must be ripped off, causing considerable pain to the patient.  It is thus the prime object of the invention to overcome the deficiencies of 
the conventional, non-sophisticated method. It is a further object of the invention to provide an infusion catheter holder 
which is adapted to be easily attached and removed, as the case may be, 
without causing any inconvenience to the patient. It is a still further object of the invention to provide a holder which is in 
form of a flexible band essentially adapted to be secured and removed by 
using releasable attaching means, such as VELCRO, zipper-like fasteners, 
mushroom fasteners, and the like. Thus provided according to the invention is a holder for infusion 
administering catheter devices which comprise a head portion and a 
catheter portion. The holder is formed as a deformable band having a first 
portion configured to overlie the device in its administered position onto a 
patient's arm without obstructing access to its functional parts. A second 
portion is adapted to surround the arm portion of the patient and become 
tightened over the said first portion by releasable attaching means. Said first portion may be provided with an opening through which the said 
head portion of the catheter is accessible, as well as with a pair of ribs 
extending at both sides of said

A holder for infusion administering catheter devices which comprise 
a head portion and a catheter portion, the holder being formed as 

deformable band, having a first portion configured to overlie the device in 
its administered position onto a patient's arm without obstructing access 

to its functional parts, and a second portion adapted to surround the arm 
portion of the patient and become tightened over the said first portion by 

releasable attaching means. 
The holder as claimed in Claim, said first band portion having an 
opening through which the said head portion is accessible. 
The holder as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the said first band 
portion comprises a pair of ribs extending alongside of the said opening 
The holder as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the said first band portion 
is provided with a VELCRO fastener lining at its side facing the patient's 

arm portion, and said band second portion is provided with at least a 
mating VELCRO fastening lining at its side facing away from the 

patient's arm portion. 
The holder as claimed in Claim 4 wherein a second VELCRO lining 
is provided, distanced from said at least mating VELCRO lining. 
A holder as claimed in claim 1, wherein the deformable band is made of 
an elastic, stretchable material. 
A holder as claimed in claim 6, wherein the elastic, stretchable material 
is silicone rubber. 
A holder as claimed in claim 6, wherein the elastic, stretchable material 
is a BVS K-Resin. 
A holder as claimed in claim 6, wherein the releasable attaching means 
are constituted by complementary male and female elements. 
A holder as claimed in claim 9, wherein the releasable attaching 
means are core fasteners. 
A holder as claimed in claim 10, wherein the core fasteners are 
mushroom fasteners. 
A holder as claimed in claim 9 wherein the releasable attaching means 
comprise female elements, constituted by apertures, in the second portion 

of the holder, and male elements, constituted by matching projections 
provided in the first portion of the holder. 
A holder as claimed in claim 12, wherein the projections constituting 
the releasable attachings means comprise a stem portion and a head 

portion wider than the said stem portion and adapted elastically to pass 
thrown the apertures which constitute the female elements and secure the 

said male elements to said female elements by their head portions being 
superimposed to the second portion of the device. 
A device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the first portion thereof is 
provided with openings adjacent to the side thereof opposite to the side on 

which the openings through which the head portions of the catheter device 
is accessible, whereby to concentrate the longitudinal strain of the holder, 

when in use, to a zone close to said opposite side.
