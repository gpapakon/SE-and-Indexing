<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with the shaping of
metals by controlled removal of material from the
surface of the workpiece being shaped or sized. It
relates in particular to a method of improving the
efficiency of some conventional metal-shaping tools by
changing the tool/workpiece surface interface conditions
to increase the rate at which the tool can remove metal
under certain operational conditions.A common way of shaping a metal workpiece by the
removal of material therefrom involves rubbing contact,
as experienced in a conventional wedge-shaped metal or
ceramic cutting tool with a sharp edge (a technique
generally known as "machining"). Here, the tool's
cutting edge is set so it can penetrate the workpiece
surface, and rubbing takes place just below the original
surface level to cause material to be sheared from the
surface being machined. The tool with the cutting edge
can take many forms - for example, teeth on a rotating
mill cutter, or a chisel-like tool in a lathe (tools of
the latter type are often referred to as single point
cutting tools). Alternatively, rubbing contacts can be
between burnishing lands on a rotary tool, or between a
polished raised ring on a linear tool (like a burnisher
on a broach tool). Here the rubbing takes place only at
the contact area with the surface, and material is wiped
or smoothed out but generally not sheared from the
surface. This method of shaping is an instance of
forging, and when done cold is often referred to as cold
working. Examples of the materials used in the tools 
used in cutting and cold working are tool steels,
tungsten carbide, alumina, cubic boron nitride, and
natural and artificial diamond.Another important type of material removal used in
metal shaping employs abrasive rubbing tools, typified
by conventional grinding wheels. These use many very
hard and small crystalline grains (or "grits") of
abrasive material with a multiplicity of cutting faces
(in the tool the angles of the cutting faces of these
abrasive grains will be randomly distributed with
respect to the machined surface). These abrasive grains
range in size typically from 0.01mm to 0.4mm across, and
are distributed at densities from about 20mm-2 down to
less than 2mm-2. They are commonly used in lapping and
honing stones, grinding wheels, super-finishing stones,
and the abrasive media used in tumbling or vibratory
polishing and finishing processes. Examples of the
abrasive materials are garnet, emery, pumice, silica,
diamond, carbides of iron or tungsten, silicon carbide,
cubic

<CLAIMS>
A method of shaping a metal workpiece by removing
material from the surface (13, 14) thereof, in which method the

surface (13, 14) of the workpiece is continuously "rubbed" by a
tool (15, 16) in a friction-inducing manner and in the presence

of a friction-enhancing agent in a quantity and in a
form such that actual friction enhancement occurs, and

the surface material (17, 18) in frictional
contact with the tool (15, 16) is sheared from the workpiece

surface by the continuing motion of the tool (15, 16), and
discarded.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, in which the metal
removal process used employs a wire brush, a hone stone,

a flex hone, or a grinding wheel.
A method as claimed in either of the preceding
Claims, in which the friction enhancing agent has a

viscosity as low as 10 c/s.
A method as claimed in any of the preceding Claims,
in which the friction enhancing agent is one or more

silicone.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, in which the
silicone is a polydimethyl or polyhydrogenmethyl

siloxane.
A method as claimed in Claim 5, in which the
silicone is one or more polydimethylsiloxane. 
A method as claimed in any of the preceding Claims,
in which the friction enhancing agent is used in its

normal "neat" form by simply applying it direct to the

tool/workpiece interface.
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6, in which
the friction enhancing agent for an abrasive tool is

impregnated into the tool.
A method as claimed in any of the preceding Claims,
in which the rubbing action is regularly interrupted by

disengaging the contacting surfaces or by a reversal or
change of direction of rubbing.
