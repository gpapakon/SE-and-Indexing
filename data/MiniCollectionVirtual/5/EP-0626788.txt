<ABSTRACT>
A video image decoder architecture for implementing a 
processing algorithm in the 40-ms mode on high-resolution TV 

sets, of a kind adapted to handle TV signals being received 
on respective transmission channels (A,C), comprises: 


a video signal demultiplexer (12) being input said 
transmission channels (A,C); 
respective processing blocks (13,14) for separately 
handling the signals from each of the channels (A,C) and 

comprising, 

a video image format converter (15), 
a local memory (17) connected after the converter, and 
at least one median filter (25) and one systolic filter 
(27) cascade connected after said memory for restoring, by 

interpolation, signal samples related to successive lines of 
the video image;and a summing node (11) for adding together 

the outputs from each processing block (13,14) by obtaining a 
time mean between restored samples (Ai,Ci) of the channels 

(A,C). This architecture allows a drastic reduction in the 
number of memories required for processing the restore 

algorithm, as well as a reduction in overall silicon area for 
the system, and accordingly, the possibility of having the 

whole 40-millisecond processing portion integrated to a 
single chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an architecture for implementing a
restitution algorithm of a TV picture in the "40-millisecond"
mode, within a decoder of a HD-MAC (High Definition
Television Multiplexing Analog Component) system for handling
a high-resolution TV signal (HDTV).As is well known, high-resolution television (HDTV) presently
constitutes one of the technologically most challenging
applications in the electronic field.This is to be attributed to the market potential of
electronic equipment directly or indirectly associated with
that kind of television. The market potential is so vast that
it has become of primary interest to any of the industries
involved in consumer electronics.Within this frame, considerable effort is paid by the
relevant industry for offering products of ever improved
quality to an ever more comprehensive public.In the HDTV field, a combine of the principal European
manufacturers have proposed a standard called "High
Definition Multiplexing Analog Component" (HDMAC) which
provides the transmission of TV pictures with a resolution
twice as high both horizontally and vertically, and in analog
form. This in a manner that can still be compatible as to
format with existing TV receivers preset for a low-resolution
standard TV signal.This standard will be called "algorithm" hereinafter, without
the term implying that processor programs are the only way of
implementing the standard. The algorithm provides some image pre-processing steps before
transmission, so that an image to be transmitted is adjusted
to a compatible format with the existing one, that is with
that of low-resolution TV.Likewise, receiver sets should be capable of so processing
the received image as to restore it to its original format.For a clearer appreciation of the invention, it would seem
advisable to first provide a definition of the HD (High
Definition) image format in the HDMAC system.The image picked up by a TV camera is formed of 1250 lines
(of which only 1152 are active) transmitted in interlaced
fashion at a half-frame frequency of 50 Hz and a line
sampling frequency of 54 MHz, which gives 1728 samples per
line (of which only 1440 are active).The standard-resolution image format consists of half as many
(625) lines and half as many (864) samples per line;
additionally, the sampling frequency is 27 MHz. Accordingly,
the line period will be of 64 Âµs.It thus appears that to reduce the format of the HD image to
that of standard definition, one must reduce the number of
the samples transmitted to one fourth
