<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is 
provided, comprising a support having thereon an antistatic 

layer and further having thereon a silver halide emulsion 
layer, wherein the antistatic layer comprises a water-soluble 

conductive polymer and a hydrophobic polymer, the layer having 
been hardened with a hardener, or the antistatic layer 

comprises conductive metal oxide particles containing at least 
one metal selected from Zn, Ti, Sn, Al, In, Si, Mg, Ba, Mo, W 

and V; and the silver halide emulsion is spectrally sensitized 
by adding thereto a substantially water-insoluble spectral-sensitizing 

dye in the form of a dispersion of solid particles 
dispersed in an aqueous medium substantially free from an 

organic solvent and a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive 
material improved in development uniformity, when subjected to 
rapid-processing, without deterioration of antistatic ability 
and a processing method thereof. Recently, rapid progress has been made in increasing the speed of 
processing and in decreasing the replenishing rate. As a result of these 
developments problems such as uneven development have arisen. 
It is known that 
uneven development may be prevented by accelerating the developing speed using a 
photographic material with an increased swelling degree. 
However, it has been found that this method results in 
deterioration in drying speed due to the increase of the water 
content.  
 The addition of various surfactants has been 
attempted to solve uneven development but their effect was 
not sufficient. The present inventor has attempted the 
addition of a nonionic polyethylene-type surfactant for the 
purpose of preventing charging of the photographic 
material, however, uneven development was not avoided when 
the material was subjected to rapid-processing. EP-A-491176 discloses a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material said to be improved in anti-static 
ability, which comprises between its support and a back-coating 
layer, an anti-static layer consisting of a water-soluble 
conductive polymer, hydrophobic polymer particles 
and a hardener, or consisting of a metal oxide. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material capable 
of prohibiting occurrence of uneven development without 
deteriorating its antistatic ability. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material 
comprising a support which has, on at least one side, an 
antistatic layer comprising a water-soluble conductive 
polymer and a hydrophobic polymer that has been hardened 
with a hardener, or an antistatic layer which comprises 
conductive metal oxide particles comprising at least one 
metal selected from Zn, Ti, Sn, Al, In, Si, Mg, Ba, Mo, W 
and V; said antistatic layer having thereon a silver halide 
emulsion layer comprising a silver halide emulsion, which  
 
is spectrally sensitized by a substantially water-insoluble 
spectral sensitizing dye having a solubility in water of 
from 2x10-4 to 4x10-2 mol/l at 27°C in the form of a 
dispersion of solid particles having an average size of 1µm 
or less in an aqueous medium substantially free from an 
organic solvent
