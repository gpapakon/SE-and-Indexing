<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing very pure paraxylene from a charge containing a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons having from 7 to 9 carbon atoms, wherein is circulated at least a portion of the charge in a zone adapted to enrich a first fraction with paraxylene and at lest a portion of said first fraction is purified by at least one temperature crystallization in at least one crystallization zone, the process being characterized in that the first paraxylene-enriched fraction is crystallized in a crystallization zone comprising at least two high temperature crystallization stages (50, 70), and preferably between + 10 and - 25  DEG C. The paraxylene enriching zone may be a very low temperature crystallization, a selective adsorption or a toluen dismutation zone.

Process for the production of paraxylene of very high purity from a

feedstock that contains a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons having 7 to 9 carbon
atoms in which at least a portion of the feedstock is circulated in a so-called

enrichment zone that is suited to enrich a first fraction at more than 50 % by weight
of paraxylene, and at least a portion of said first fraction is purified in a so-called

purification zone by at least two high-temperature crystallization comprised between
+ 10°C and - 30°C in at least two crystallization zones, whereby the process is


characterized in that
 said first fraction that is enriched with paraxylene is
crystallized in a first crystallization zone (70) at a temperature T1, the first crystals

are separated from a first mother liquor, first paraxylene crystals are recovered, at
least one part of the first mother liquor is crystallized in a second crystallization

zone (50) at a temperature T2 lower than the temperature T1, second crystals are
separated from a second mother liquor, second paraxylene crystals are recovered

and the first and second paraxylene crystals are mixed.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the paraxylene-enrichment zone is
at least a crystallization zone at a very low temperature in which the feedstock

containing the aromatic hydrocarbon mixture with 8 carbon atoms is introduced,
which delivers, after a separation stage, a liquid that is isomerized in an

isomerization zone and crystals that are melted and that are at least a portion of said
first fraction.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the paraxylene-enrichment zone is
a selective adsorption zone (8) that contains a zeolitic adsorbent in which the

feedstock containing the aromatic hydrocarbon mixture with 8 carbon atoms is
introduced ; a selective adsorption of the feedstock is carried out; in the presence of

a desorption solvent, said first paraxylene-enriched fraction (9, 19) and a second
paraxylene-depleted fraction (10, 15) are recovered; said second fraction is

isomerized in an isomerization zone (21) that contains a catalyst for isomerization 
under conditions that are suitable for producing an isomerate that contains

paraxylene, and the isomerate is recycled (2) at least in part to the adsorption zone.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein at least a portion of
the mother liquor that results from the coldest stage of the purification zone is

recycled to enrichment zone (8).
Process according to claim 1, wherein the paraxylene enrichment zone is
at least one disproportionation zone of the feedstock consisting essentially in toluene

that produces an effluent containing benzene and xylenes and the effluent is distilled
for removing benzene and unreacted toluene.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein a first crystallization
of the paraxylene-enriched fraction is carried out (Figures 2 and 3) in a first

crystallization zone (70) at a temperature T1; a suspension (81) of first paraxylene
crystals is recovered in a first mother liquor; the first crystals from the first mother

liquor are separated in a first separation zone (82); the first crystals are washed with
a washing solvent in the first separation zone; at least a portion of the first mother

liquor and of the washing liquor is crystallized in a second crystallization zone (50)
at a temperature T2 that is lower than temperature T1; a suspension (85) of second

paraxylene crystals is recovered in a second mother liquor; the second crystals from
the second mother liquor are separated in a second separation zone (86); the second

crystals are washed with the washing solvent in the second separation zone; a second
mother liquor (87) containing washing liquor is recovered ; the first and the second

paraxylene crystals are mixed, and they are melted (89) completely, and a stream
(90) of molten paraxylene is recovered.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5 wherein a first crystallization of
the paraxylene-enriched fraction is carried out (Figures 4 and 5) in a first

crystallization zone at a temperature T1; a suspension of first paraxylene crystals is
recovered in a first mother liquor ; the first crystals from the first mother liquor are

separated in a first separation zone (82); at least a portion of the first mother liquor
is crystallized in a second crystallization zone (50) at a temperature T2 that is less 

than T1, the second crystals from the second mother liquor are separated in a second
separation zone (86); the second mother liquor is recovered; the first crystals and

the second crystals are recovered and they are washed in at least one zone (110) for
separation and washing with a suitable washing solvent; on the one hand, a washing

liquor (115) is recovered that is recycled at least in part to first crystallization zone
(70), and on the other hand, paraxylene crystals are recovered; they are melted
