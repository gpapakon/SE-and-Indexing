<DESCRIPTION>
 GLAZING AGENTThe invention is concerned with glazing agents that are ready to use-Glazing agents that are not ready to use are known from, e.g., EP 205,195. According to this reference, a glazing agent can be provided comprising a homogenized emulsion of a protein, an edible oil, water and a thin-boiling starch. The thin-boiling starch is applied in order to regulate the viscosity of the emulsion.However, the keepability of such a glazing agent was not sufficient. Although this keepability could be increased by drying the glazing agent, the resulting product was no longer ready to use.Therefore, we have performed a study in order to find a glazing agent that :- is ready to use;- has the required spreadability, i.e. viscosity; - shows good keepability.As a result of this study, we have found that ready-to-use glazing agents fulfilling the above-mentioned requirements have the following composition :They are fat-in-water emulsions comprising :1-25 wt.%, preferably 5-15 wt.%, of a liquid vegetable oil;5-15 wt.%, preferably 8-11 wt.%, of casein or one of its salts;0.005-10 wt.% of an emulsifier, preferably 0.01- 1.0 wt.% of an emulsifier, in particular one selected from the group of fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides from C14-C22, preferably saturated and/or unsaturated C16- c18 fatty acids; 

 0.1-8.0 wt.% of a composition giving a browning upon heating, preferably a Maillard-type reaction, such as lactose, or a milk product containing lactose, amounts of 0.3-3 wt.% being preferred, while suitable milk products are skimmed milk powder or buttermilk powder; balance : waterThe liquid vegetable oil being defined as an oil being liquid up to 30°C (so: N30 « 0) . So, our composition is free of starch or modified starch.The viscosity of the composition at 20°C is 1-105 Pa.s, preferably 20-200 Pa.s.The keepability of these compositions is very satisfactory as the compositions can be sterilized by UHT treatment, i.e. 1-30 seconds at 130-160°C. After this treatment, the viscosity of the glazing agent remains within the specifications, while keepabilities (ambient shelf-lives) are obtained for at least 3 months.The best results are obtained by applying a liquid vegetable oil with a solid fat index at 20°C of less than 7.0, a preferred oil being a medium-hardened soybean oil.This liquid oil can also comprise some amount, in particular 2-15 wt% on oil, of a hydrogenated vegetable fat. A preferred fat being hydrogenated palm oil, in particular PO-45. Application hereof improves the viscosity and the stability
