<ABSTRACT>
A manipulable hand for use in laparoscopic 
surgery is disclosed, having a master or control hand with 

clamps for attaching the master hand to that of an 
operator, the master hand having at least one finger, the 

finger having at least one hinge corresponding to an 
interphalangeal joint in a human hand. The manipulable 

hand further includes a slave or controlled hand, distally 
disposed from the operator, the slave hand having at least 

one finger, the finger having at least one hinge 
corresponding to an interphalangeal joint of a human 

finger. Both the master and slave hinges are capable of 
movement corresponding to flexion and extension of a human 

finger. The master hand and the slave hand are connected 
by motion transmission rods or cables, and the movements of 

the slave hand corresponds one-for-one to the movements of 
the master hand. The preferred embodiment of the 

manipulable hand has two fingers and a thumb, the thumb of 
both the master and slave hands is capable of movements 

corresponding to palmar adduction and abduction, and the 
fingers of both the master and slave hands are capable of 

coplanar spreading away from each other and moving back 
toward each other, moving from a substantially aligned 

position to a V-shaped configuration. The rods are 
enclosed within a hollow shaft, and the master and slave 

hands are mounted with parallel connections therebetween 
forming wrists at the ends of the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical instruments 
and, more particularly, to a manipulable hand for use in 
laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgical techniques involve 
performing surgical procedures through a small diameter 
tube that is inserted through a small incision in the 
patient. These techniques minimize trauma to surrounding 
tissue and organs and greatly reduce the recovery period 
which, in many cases, is due to the size of the incision 
required to gain access to the surgical site. To perform 
these laparoscopic techniques, a small incision is made, 
and a small tube or cannula is inserted through the 
incision. The cannula constitutes a port through which 
various instruments can be inserted to perform procedures, 
such as cutting, suturing and removal of organs. These 
procedures involve far less trauma in the patient, less 
recovery time, and the ability to control medical costs 
generally by the elimination of large incisions on the 
patient's body. Laparoscopic surgical techniques have essentially 
removed the surgeon's hands from the patient's body and 
replaced them with blades, suture needles, and small crude 
graspers. In many cases the surgeon needs better, more 
sensitive control, like that afforded by the human hand. 
Such control can be achieved by directly using the 
surgeon's skilled, highly trained hands. However, the 
purpose of laparoscopy is to reduce the trauma of surgery 
by making smaller incisions. Such smaller incisions are 
enabled by providing means by which the surgeon can observe 
the site of interest and means by which the surgeon may 
remotely perform his surgical function. Provision of these  
 
means avoids the necessity of large incisions due to the 
need to insert the surgeon's hands into the surgical 
incision. In order to achieve the goals of laparoscopic 
surgery, the means provided as a substitute for the 
surgeon's hands should be as similar as possible to the 
real thing. The closest approximations presently in use 
are grasping devices of rather crude design, and devices 
capable only of cutting, scraping, or similar actions. All 
of these are rather primitive compared to the human hand 
wielding an appropriate surgical tool. Known laparoscopic 
techniques allow the surgeon only limited capabilities 
within the surgical site. Document EP-A-0613762 belongs to the state of the art only 
by virtue of Article 54(3) EPC and is the relevant prior art to be 
considered as far as the contracting states AT, CH, Li, FR, GB, IT, NL 
are concerned. This
