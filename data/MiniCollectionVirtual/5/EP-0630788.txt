road vehicle, having a foot-operable braking 

transducer (12) which generates electrical braking 
demand signals (D) representative of a driver's 

braking demand, load transducers (18,36) which 
generate electrical load signals (L) representative of 

the respective load on different axles of the vehicle, 
and an electronic controller (10) which receives the 

braking demand signals (D) and load signals (L) and 
generates electrical output signals (B) for 

controlling the operation of braking devices (16,34) 
for the wheels carried by axles, the controller (10) 

including a load compensation device (90) which 
acts to modify the output signal (B) of the controller 

(10) to the various braking devices so as to take 
account of prevailing loads on the respective axles. 

The system can be brought into a test mode wherein in 
place of the electrical braking demand signals (D) 

representative of driver braking demand, a preset 
standard braking input demand (D

controller whereby the system generates for testing 

purposes compensated braking pressure which take into 
account the operating values of the axle loads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic 
braking systems for road vehicles and is concerned 
with a means of testing the operation of such systems 
with the vehicle static or substantially static. An electronic braking system (EPB) having 
compensation for the major disturbance to braking has 
been described in EP-A-0205277. In the latter system, 
the level of braking at each axle of a vehicle is made 
to be proportional to driver braking demand as 
signified by an electrical signal from a brake pedal 
and also proportional to axle load as assessed from 
axle load sensors. Alternatively, for some vehicles 
which have only small changes in load on particular 
axles, the operational load value is programmed into 
the system at final build or it is calculated from 
other measured axles, for example in the case where a 
towing vehicle carries a semi-trailer. In the latter 
case, the front axle load is substantially constant 
except in so far as a small percentage of the rear 
axle load increase is passed on to the front axle as a 
result of the trailer load being applied at some 
predetermined distance in front of the towing vehicle 
rear axle. In all the latter cases, it is assumed that the  
 
axle loads are known to the system, and it would be an 
advantage (and possibly a practical requirement) that 
the resulting load-sensitive braking distribution 
should be able to be checked independently from time 
to time as a service check for test authorities or 
simply for maintenance purposes. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide an electronic braking system having means for 
static testing, or substantially static testing of the 
load-sensitive braking distribution provided by the 
system. In accordance with the present invention, there 
is provided an electronic braking system which can be 
instructed to enter a test mode wherein a preset 
standard braking input demand is applied automatically 
on the test mode being entered, so that the system 
statically generates compensated braking pressures 
which take into account the operating values of axle 
load. By virtue of this arrangement, the latter 
pressures can be compared with standard figures issued 
for the vehicle type for two or more predetermined 
conditions of applied load. In accordance with one embodiment of the 
invention, there is provided an electronic braking 
system for multi-axle road vehicle, comprising 
a foot-operable breaking transducer for  
 
generating electrical braking demand signals (D) 
representative of a
