<ABSTRACT>
A container for magnetic tape cassettes having a housing (1) and a slide (2) receiving a magnetic tape cassette (6) is proposed, the slide (2) being lockable in the housing (1) in a storage position and being displaceable by means of a spring element (15) partially out of the housing into a removal position. In the removal position, the part (3) of the slide (2) protruding out of the housing can be swivelled downwards about a horizontal swivel axis (4) with the housing aligned horizontally. To permit the simplest and most reliable handling possible when removing and/or reinserting a magnetic tape cassette, it is provided that, in the storage position, there is a gap (21) in the baseplate (5) of the slide (2) between the swivelling part (3) and the non-swivelling, rearward baseplate (23), and the swivel axis (4) is arranged above and at a distance from the baseplate (5).

A container for magnetic tape cassettes having a housing (1) and a
slider (2) accommodating a magnetic tape cassette (6), which slider is

arranged to be locked in the housing (1) in a storage position and is
arranged to be displaced by means of a spring element (15) partially out of

the housing (1) into a removal position, wherein the part (3) of the slider
(2) projecting from the housing (1) in the removal position is pivotable

downwards about a horizontal pivot axis (4) when the housing (1) is
horizontally oriented, wherein, in the storage position, there is a gap (21)

in the base plate (5) of the slider (2) between the pivotable part (3) and the
non-pivotable rear base plate (23), and the pivot axis (4) is arranged

above and spaced from the base plate (5), and wherein beneath the pivot
axis (4) a peg (9) projects outwards from the pivotable part (3) of the slider

(2) at least on one side, which peg engages with a guide cam (11) which is
formed laterally on the housing (1) and which in the removal position

presses the pivotable part (3) downwards at the peg (9), characterized in
that the peg (9) has a ramp face (18) as a means safeguarding against too

great a pressure, and is mounted on a carrier element (19) which is
located laterally on the slider (2) and is arranged to be pressed resiliently

inwards.
A container according to claim 1, characterized in that, in the
storage position, the gap (21) in the base plate (5) is bridged by a first light

guide (24) lying in the housing (1), the light guide reaching as far as a
second light guide (25) which lies in the pivotable part (3) and leads to an

"empty" indicator (26) located at the front panel (27).
A container according to claim 2, characterized in that the "empty"
indicator (26) is an indicating element rotatable about a vertical axis and 

having a marking and from which a turning piece (29) projects, which
element is pressed by a restoring spring (30) into the empty position in

which the turning piece (29) projects into the receiving space (28) of the
slider (2).
A container according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that on the housing (1) locking elements (35, 36) pivotable into the tape

hubs (32, 33) of a magnetic tape cassette (6) are arranged on a
transverse axle (34) which is operated by a driver element (38) engaging

with an enlargement (39) on the inserted magnetic tape cassette (6).
