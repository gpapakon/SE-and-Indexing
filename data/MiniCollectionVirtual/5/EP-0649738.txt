<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a composite material having improved thermal and mechanical properties. This is achieved by a thermoplastic multilayer composite comprising at least   I. an outer layer made from a moulding composition based on polyvinylidene fluoride II. an interlayer, adjacent to the inner layer, made from a moulding composition based on a mixture of     a. polyamide (nylon) and   b. polyglutarimide,  where the two layers are adhesively bonded to one another.   The invention allows composite materials having the desired improved property profile to be obtained.
