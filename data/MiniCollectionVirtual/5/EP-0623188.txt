<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine composed of separate compression and combustion/expansion chambers (8) linked by a transfer duct (5), is disclosed. The compressor and expansion chambers include similarly shaped rotors (14, 26) and abutments (4, 10). Each of the rotors (14, 26) includes a vane (3, 9), and the rotors (14, 26) and abutments (4, 10) are rotationally coupled such that the vane (3, 9) enters into operative engagement with the associated abutment (4, 10) once during each revolution of the rotor (14, 26). Each abutment (4, 10) consists of a rotating disk having a gap (4g, 10g) which permits passage of the vane (3, 9) through the abutment (4, 10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 ROTARY ENGINETECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to internal combustion engines, and in particular to a rotary internal combustion engine.BACKGROUND ARTIt is common in internal combustion engines to use parts that have reciprocating and/or eccentric oscillating movements. For example, the pistons and valves of a conventional auto or diesel engines have a generally linear reciprocating motion, while the rotor of Wankel-type engine has an eccentric oscillatory motion. In such engines, reciprocating or oscillating parts are subject to high accelerations, and thus experience large inertial forces, especially at higher revolution speeds. Typically, large counterweights are required to control vibrations caused by unbalanced inertial forces acting on the various moving components. The counterweights and rugged construction required for these reciprocating or oscillating parts considerably increase the weight of the engine. Furthermore, in spite of the use of balancing counterweights, these engines often suffer from vibration problems, which result in losses of efficiency.Engines with reciprocatingpistons typically require complex mechanisms with a large number of components, thus creating increased friction, wear, weight, production cost and maintenance. Four cycle engines (i.e. conventional reciprocating piston engines) tend to be mechanically inefficient (i.e. have a low power to weight ratio) because each piston generates power over less than 1/2 revolution for every 2 revolutions of the crank shaft. Furthermore, low torque is developed at the beginning and end of the combustion cycle, due to the minimal moment-arm about the crankshaft at these points in the cycle. 

 In two cycle piston engines, the power to weight ratio is better than in four cycle engines, but these engines often suffer from inadequate exhausting of burned gasses and the resultant mixing of exhaust gasses with incoming fuel/air mixture.In reciprocating piston engines, the use of intake and exhaust valves are required to control the flow of gasses through each cylinder. For example, the exhaust valve serves to constrain the release of combustion gasses, with the result that exhaust gasses must be exhausted from the cylinder within 1/2 revolution of the crankshaft.In single stage engines (where gasses are compressed and burned in same chamber) , external super-chargers are often employed to increase compression of the fuel/air mixture and thereby increase the power of engine. However superchargers consume engine power (thus
