<ABSTRACT>
The process includes: preparing the untreated waste (1) into 
bales (3); a waste stabilization treatment that uses the 

combination of microbiological aerobic and/or anaerobic 
processes and natural and/or artificial drying, preparing 

stacks with appropriately arranged bales; covering the bales 
with materials (13) that are suitable to prevent the 

penetration of water or other liquids into the bales; 
placing the bales in a dumping site (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the disposal
of waste.As is known, the controlled dumping site is the system used
most frequently, at least in Italy, for the disposal of
municipal solid waste, because of its low cost and also
because of the difficulties encountered in providing new
incinerators or in reconditioning and adapting existing
ones.However, this solution entails a series of well-known
drawbacks for the environment and for the quality of life of
the population that inhabits the area in the vicinity of the
dumping site.The waste placed in dumping sites will in fact ferment and
putrefy. The percentage of organic material (pure organic
material plus paper and cardboard) can reach 60% of the
untreated waste and is in any case not less than 30% even in
waste from areas where differentiated waste collection has
been practiced for several years. The main drawbacks that
characterize the disposal of waste in a dumping site are
very briefly listed hereafter:
-- The large areas required to accommodate waste. Due to the
limited density obtained with conventional compacting
systems, there is an intense "consumption" of suitable
sites, which are increasingly difficult to find. 
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate, by way of example, the
variations in the density of the layers of waste as a
function of height and of the number of passes made with a
compacting device.-- The release of unpleasant odors and the dispersion of
waste material even in neighboring areas with the consequent
spoiling of the landscape. The problem of odorous emissions
is the greatest deterrent to the possibility of creating
dumping sites.
Daily covering of the refuse and other systems, even with
the best management of the site, have proved inadequate to
curb the problem, which can become a nuisance over a wide
area especially in the warmer periods of the year.The "light" materials carried by the wind are also a cause
of problems, and the costs for their recovery may be
significant.-- The spread of vermin and pests. In addition to directly
affecting civil and industrial activities, rats, sea-gulls,
flies etc. act as vectors for human and animal infections.-- The production of biogas. An aspect that is often
neglected in evaluating the environmental impact of dumping
sites is the diffusion of biogas both in the ground and in
the surrounding air. This occurs because of the low
intrinsic efficiency of the capture systems, which even in
the best of cases is never higher than 50-60%.
Biogas is normally produced starting from the second

<CLAIMS>
A process for the disposal of waste, comprising the steps
of:


grinding said waste;
forming said waste into bales (3) having a high resistance
to pressure;

characterized in that it further comprises treating said
waste by aerobic fermentation for a period of time

sufficient to allow said bales to dehydrate until they reach
a level that is incompatible with microbiological

activities, by:
placing said bales in a closed building (7) in multiple
stacked layers;
injecting air in said building; said multiple stacked
layers being adapted to allow the escape of said injected

air and the oxygenation of the outer layers of the bales;
said bales being finally removed from said closed building

and placed in a dumping site (15).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that said
bales are arranged at a distance of approximately 8 to 10 cm

from each other.
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said closed building comprises a

biofilter (9) which is arranged above the covering of said
building to treat the air.
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it comprises the impermeabilization of

said bales before said bales are placed in said dumping
site. 
A device as used in the performance of the method for
treating waste of any of the preceding claims, comprising

grinding and baling equipment and a closed fermentation
space, characterized in that said space is a building (7)

suitable to accommodate said waste, and comprising a roof
with a biofilter (9), and a flooring system provided with

air passages (11).
The device according to claim 5, characterized in that it
comprises a press that is suitable to press said waste to

produce said bales.
The device according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that it comprises an impermeabilization means that is

suitable to wrap said bales in an impermeable film (13).
