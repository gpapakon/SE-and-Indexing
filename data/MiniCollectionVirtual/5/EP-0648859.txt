<ABSTRACT>
Tungsten silicide (WSi
x
) can be deposited as a 
thin film in a low pressure chemical vapor deposition 

reactor (12) from dichlorosilane and tungsten 
hexafluoride. The presence of nitrogen reduces the 

adhesion of the WSi
x
 films onto substrates (20), 
particularly a layer of polysilicon. Thus to produce 

adherent films, nitrogen must be removed from the 
substrate prior to deposition and the low pressure 

chemical vapor deposition chamber. The chamber must 
contain an atmosphere of a noble gas such as argon, which 

can also be used as a carrier gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the deposition of 
tungsten silicide (WSix) More particularly, this invention 
relates to an improved process for the deposition of tungsten 
silicide from tungsten hexafluoride and dichlorosilane. Tungsten silicide thin films have been deposited by low 
pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) onto semiconductor 
substrates using silane (SiH4) and tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) as 
the precursor gases. The deposited coating is not as conformal 
over stepped topographies as is desired however, and the films 
have a high residual fluoride content that adversely affects 
device performance, as explained below. The above process is typically applicable to depositing 
WSix onto a semiconductor wafer having a layer of silicon oxide 
beneath a polysilicon layer. When the wafer is exposed to 
elevated temperatures, e.g., about 850°C or higher, as during 
annealing, the excess fluoride ions migrate through the 
underlying polysilicon layer and into the underlying silicon 
oxide layer. The silicon oxide layer thus appears to have an 
effective thickness increase, which in turn leads to an adverse 
change in electrical properties of semiconductor devices made 
from the layers. When using a multichamber vacuum processing system such as 
that described in US Patent 4,951,601 to Maydan et al, 
the substrate to be coated with  
 
tungsten silicide firstly is cleaned using a fluorine scrub to 
remove native oxide from the polysilicon layer. The cleaned 
substrate is then taken into a substrate transfer chamber. This 
transfer chamber has a nitrogen atmosphere (subatmospheric) to 
prevent re-oxidation of the substrate, and contains a robot to 
transfer the the substrate into a processing chamber, e.g., a 
tungsten deposition chamber, through a slit valve having an O-ring 
seal. This process has become the standard process for 
depositing tungsten silicide from silane and WF6. However, as 
substrates become larger, and feature sizes for devices become 
smaller, the above problems with step coverage and residual 
fluorine using this deposition process have become critical 
limiters for future applications. A process using dichlorosilane (DCS) instead of silane has 
also been investigated. The resultant WSix films have reduced 
fluorine content and are more conformal than those deposited 
using silane as the precursor gas, thereby providing a solution 
to the silane-based deposition process limitations. However, 
using the prior art process, the initial layers of deposition are 
tungs
