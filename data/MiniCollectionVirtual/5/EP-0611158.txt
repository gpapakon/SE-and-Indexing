<ABSTRACT>
A cooler display rack for use in a walk-in 
refrigerated cooler is described. The cooler display rack 

consists of a series of L-shaped frame sections formed from 
generally upright posts secured at their bottom end by an 

elongated shoe to form the individual frame sections. The 
frame sections are joined to adjacent frame sections by 

spacer panels and by a plurality of shelves supported in a 
cantilevered manner between a pair of adjacent posts. The 

individual shelves are supported between the posts by shelf 
support brackets and can be selectively positioned 

vertically along the height of the post, horizontally 
forward and backward relative to the post, and angularly 

with a gravity feed inclination between an approximate 8° 
forward slope and approximate 1° back slope. Bumper wires 

are inserted through holes in the shelves at the front edge 
thereof for retaining merchandise contained on the shelves. 

The arc system display rack provides heretofore unachieved 
flexibility in merchandising self-service products 

displayed on the shelves in that individual shelves can be 
variably positioned and the cooler display rack requires no 

front posts which would obstruct access to the merchandise 
contained thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to display racks. More particularly, this
invention relates to an improved display rack for use in combination with a
walk-in type cooler.Display racks are often used in supermarkets and convenience
stores to display merchandise generally handled as self-service items. For
example, display racks are often used in supermarkets to display cans or bottles
of soft drinks, the cans or bottles being removable for purchase by the customer
in a self-service manner from the display rack. Frequently the merchandise
requires refrigeration to prevent spoiling, therefore, the merchandise display rack
is located in a walk-in type cooler or a refrigerated area. The customer is
afforded access to the refrigerated merchandise provided on the display racks in
the walk-in coolers typically through glass panel doors on the coolers.Display racks are commonly supported at a front side by a series
of posts adjacent the walk-in cooler doors and at a rear side by a corresponding
series of posts. In order to provide customer access to merchandise contained on
the shelves with as little obstruction as possible, the posts which support the
shelves on the display rack are aligned with the posts to which the cooler doors
are hinged and supported. In this way, the shelves are secured between the
posts and cannot be easily positioned forward or backward and must be of the
same width as the cooler door through which a customer gains access to the
merchandise located on the shelves.Shelf and linear footage allocations of space on the display racks
in the walk-in coolers are thoroughly analyzed in space and sales merchandising
studies conducted by supermarkets and convenience stores. However, the 
antiquated current cooler shelving configuration as previously described has
forced stores to devote an integral number of cooler doors to each vendor or
product type which is often inappropriate based on sales merchandising and
customer demand studies.Another common problem in self-service display racks located in
walk-in coolers is that of the need to constantly move merchandise forward on
the shelf as the forwardmost objects or items of merchandise are removed.
Traditionally, supermarkets have had stock clerks regularly move through the
store placing new stock on the shelves or moving the older stock forward on the
shelf so as to make it more easily accessible to customers.Another problem with cooler display racks of the type previously
described is that the forwardmost item on the shelf, although the most accessible
to

merchandise supported thereon comprising a plurality of

generally upright posts (16) having front and rear edges
(40,42) and a pair of lateral spaced sides (17a,17b), base

means (18) attached to the bottom end of each post (16) for
bracing the post (16) in a generally vertical orientation,

the post (16) and the base mans (18) forming a generally L-shaped
frame section (30), connecting means (32) for

joining in spaced and generally parallel relation each said
frame section (30) to an adjacent frame section (30), and,

a plurality of shelves (34) extending between an adjacent
pair of posts (16), each shelf (34) being secured by

attachment means (44,46,66,92,94,96) for mounting the shelf
(34) in a generally cantilever manner between the adjacent

pair of posts (16) wherein the attachment means
(44,46,66,92,94,96) facilitate the selective vertical

positioning of the shelf (34) between the post ends and
angular inclination of the shelf (34) relative to a

horizontal plane and wherein the attachment means
(44,46,66,92,94,96) permit selective vertical and angular

inclination positioning of the shelf (34) irrespective of
the vertical and angular inclination position of the shelf

(34), characterised in that the attachment means
(44,46,66,92,94,96) facilitate selective horizontal

positioning of the shelf (34) relative to the post front
and rear edges (40,42), and in that the attachment means

(44,46,66,92,94,96) permit selective vertical, horizontal
and angular inclination positioning of the shelf (34)

irrespective of the vertical, horizontal and angular
inclination position of the shelf (34).
A display rack as claimed in Claim 1, further
comprising stop means (50) on the shelves (34) for

retaining merchandise supported thereon.
A display rack as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the
stop means comprises a plurality of generally inverted U-shaped

bumper wires (50) each of which has a pair of 
downwardly extending legs (104) terminating at an end

portion (110), the end portions (110) forming an obtuse
angle with the legs (104) and each leg (104) and terminal

end portion (110) being generally orthogonal to a crossbar
(106), joining the pair of legs (104) and wherein in each

shelf (34) has holes (112) adapted to receive the end
portions (110) of a bumper wire (50) such that when the end

portions (110) are inserted into the holes (112) and the
bumper wire (50) is pivoted with respect to the shelf (34),

the end portions (110) are embedded in the shelf holes
(112) thereby securing the bumper wire (50) in the shelf

(34) by preventing removal of the bumper wire (50) by
pulling on the bumper wire (50) in a direction orthogonal

to the shelf (34).

wherein the attachment means comprises a plurality of post

slots (44,46) on each lateral side (17a,17b) of each post
(16), the slots (44,46) being arranged in two parallel

columns proximate the front and rear edges (40,42) of the 
posts (16) and being adapted to receive a shelf support

bracket (66) having a pair of support hooks (77a,77b), a
first of which support hooks engages a slot (44) in the

front edge column and a second of which support hooks
engages a slot (46) in the rear edge column, each shelf

support bracket (66) having shelf support means (74,76) for
supporting a shelf (34), the attachment means facilitating

the selective vertical positioning of a shelf (34) between

Claim 7, each shelf support bracket (66) has a screw (84)

threadably engaged through a hole (86) therein which
frictionally engages with a shelf (34) supported by the

bracket (66) such that positive rotation of the screw (84)
in a first direction increases the angular inclination of 

the shelf (34) relative to a horizontal plane and reverse
rotation of the screw (84) in a second direction decreases

the angular inclination of the shelf (34).
