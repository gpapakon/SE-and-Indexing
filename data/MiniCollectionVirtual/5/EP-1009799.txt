<DESCRIPTION>
 ULTRASONIC DENTAL CLEANSING TABLETField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a water-soluble dental cleansing composition comprising scrubbing particles of microcrystalline cellulose which may effectively be used with the aid of ultrasonic energy.Background of the InventionIn order to maintain the oral health of an individual who wears a removable oral prostheses, it is necessary to ensure the elimination of plaque or tartar that may accumulate on the prostheses. Traditionally, dentists or dental technicians have removed tartar during regular examinations or at the time of correction of prostheses. In this connection, it has become common practice for the trained individual to employ chemical, mechanical or vibratory means to clean and dissolve dental calculuses or tartar of removable oral prostheses. Such practice includes the use of ultrasonic devices to provide the energy necessary to loosen debris from soiled dentures .Typically, when ultrasonic energy is to be applied, soiled dentures are placed in a liquid solution within the ultrasonic cleaning device. Ultrasonic energy is then applied after which time the dentures are removed from the instrument and rinsed. The time required to effectuate the cleansing process utilizing such ultrasonic energy is dependent upon the amount of staining present on the dentures and requires 

anywhere from a minimum of 15 minutes for lightly stained— dentures up to 60 minutes for dentures which are more heavily stained. A consumer wishing to clean dentures without the use of such ultrasonic energy finds that a considerably longer time period is required, typically necessitating a soaking time of about 12 hours. Accordingly, there is a need for a denture cleaning composition which may be used with the aid of a vibratory or mechanical means, to effectively remove debris in a shorter period of time then is presently required with soaking alone.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a dental cleansing composition comprising scrubbing particles; a bleaching agent; a bleaching enhancer; a tablet aid; a tablet disintegrator, a tartar control agent; a crystallization inhibitor; a chelating agent; and a pH adjusting agent.The present composition may be used with the aid of ultrasonic energy, to effectively remove debris in a shorter period of time then is presently required by dental cleansing compositions .Detailed Description of the InventionThe composition of the present invention provides a denture cleansing tablet which is particularly quick
