<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous chlorinated olefin copolymer
latexes which are useful in the preparation of adhesives and coating
compositions.Chlorinated olefin polymers have been used as binder resins in
adhesive and coating compositions for many years because the presence of
chlorine along the saturated polymer backbone imparts chemical resistance and
outdoor weatherability to these products. Such compositions have therefore
been especially suited for use in moisture resistant adhesives and marine and
industrial coatings. Although the performance characteristics of these products
has been excellent, the use of such compositions has declined over the years
because they are solvent-based. Heightened concern regarding the
environmental impact and health hazards associated with compositions of high
volatile organic content (VOC) has led to a preference in the industry for
aqueous latex coating and adhesive compositions.Limited attempts have been made to develop aqueous chlorinated
resin latex compositions, the objective being to maintain chemical and moisture
resistance while minimizing VOC, but such attempts have met with only limited
success. The high surfactant level necessary to obtain stable latexes adversely
affects adhesion and, in addition, moisture barrier properties of coatings derived
from the latexes have also proved to be inadequate.JP-A-3-182543 (Derwent Abstract 91-277161)
discloses a latex composition comprising a chlorinated
polyolefin modified with an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid
and/or anhydride.JP-A-60-115679 (Derwent Abstract 85-187231)
discloses an aqueous dispersion of a chlorosulfonated
polyolefin and an adhesive composition for bonding a
fibrous material to a rubber which is comprised of a
mixture of an aqueous resorcinol formaldehyde resin liquid,
the aqueous dispersion of the chlorosulfonated polyolefin,
and a natural rubber latex.The present invention provides stable aqueous chlorinated latex
compositions which are self-stabilized as a result of their chemical structure.
Therefore, the use of conventional surfactants is not required and the problems
associated with the presence of large amounts of surfactants are eliminated. More specifically this invention is directed to
chlorinated resin latex composition which does not form a
substantial amount of coagulum on standing for two weeks at
room temperature consisting of an aqueous 5-75% solids
suspension of a salt of a post-chlorinated copolymer of
ethylene and an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid selected from
acrylic acid and
