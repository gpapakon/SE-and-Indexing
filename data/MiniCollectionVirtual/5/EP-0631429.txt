<ABSTRACT>
A first image data representing an image 
containing a plurality of first pixels at first 

density is converted into a second image data 
representing the image by a plurality of second 

pixels at a second density which is a selected 
multiple of the first density. For each of the 

first pixels which are overlapped with the second 
pixels, the ratio of the size of the overlapped 

portion to the size of the first pixels is determined 
on the basis of the selected multiple. The 

weighted mean of the pixel signals representing 
each of the first pixels overlapped is calculated 

by the weight coefficients determined by the 
corresponding ratio, thus obtaining the pixel 

signals representing the second pixels. Also, 
before the first image data are converted into 

the second image data, the first image data 
is subjected to a given correction process as 

required. This correction process is carried out as 
follows: the constants of correction of the given 

correction process for each of the pixel signals 
of the first pixel data are determined; the pixel 

signals are divided into a plurality of bit blocks 
so that each block contains a given number of 

bits; a given mathematical operation is executed 
on the number represented by each of the bit 

blocks of each pixel signal, and the constants for the correction determined for each pixel 
signal to determine corrected partial 

data; and corrected pixel signals are generated by combining 
the corrected partial data obtained for each of the plurality 

of bit blocks of each pixel signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
and an apparatus for processing image data, and in 
particular, to a method of and an apparatus for 
processing image data in which data inputted from an 
image input device such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) 
is subjected to a shading correction, and if desired to 
a line density conversion. Heretofore, in order to obtain data suitable 
for presentation on a display from image data produced 
from an input device such as a CCD, it has been known to 
execute processing as shown in Fig. 1. That is, a color or monochrome analog signal 
representing an image to be displayed is attained from a 
CCD sensor 1 (step 1) and then the analog signal 
undergoes an analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion into a 
digital signal (step 2). In an ordinary case, to 
correct an error due to shading distortion of a white 
level of the image signal obtained from each of a 
plurality of CCD elements constituting the CCD sensor, 
each pixel signal undergoes a shading correction (step  
 
3). The resultant signal is then subjected to grade 
conversion (γ conversion; step 4). The converted signal 
undergoes conversion of line density if necessary (step 
5). After subjected to a known modulation transfer 
function (MFT) correction (step 6) and a color 
correction (step 7), the signal is applied to a display 
(not shown) or a recording apparatus. The shading correction will be described in 
more detail. Each pixel signal generated from an image 
input device such as a CCD includes a black-level error 
due to deviation in a characteristic of CCD element and 
a white-level error related to the shading distortion as 
shown in Fig. 2A. It is hence necessary to correct the 
pixel signal of each CCD element to obtain uniform black 
and white levels as shown in Fig. 2B. According to one 
of the known correcting methods, correction constants of 
the respective CCD elements are beforehand determined 
and stored in a table. For an original pixel signal 
produced from each CCD element, the correction constant 
is read from the table to correct the original pixel 
signal by the correction constant so as to obtain a 
corrected pixel signal. In a known correction method to 
achieve the computation at a high speed, a corrected 
pixel signal is computed in advance for each of the 
combinations between various original pixel signals and 
various correction constants, and memorized in another 
table. For each original pixel signal generated from a  
 
CCD element, the corrected pixel signal is readily 
obt
