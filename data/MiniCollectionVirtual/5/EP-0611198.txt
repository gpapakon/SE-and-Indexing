Cooling device for power electrical components 
having electrodes, the device comprising a heatsink (1) 

including a circuit in which a cooling fluid can flow and a 
first side (18, 40) for exchange of heat with and in thermal 

contact with the component to be cooled, characterised in that 
the device further comprises an electrically insulative and 

good heat conductor material plate (4, 39) between said first 
side of the heatsink and a first side of an electrical 

connection (6, 41) whose second side is adapted to make 
thermal and electrical contact with one electrode of the 

component, the device including means mechanically joining the 
heatsink and said electrical connection so that the cooling 

device forms a compact assembly. 
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the mechanical coupling means comprise an electrical insulator 

(8, 42) disposed between said connection (6, 41) and the 
heatsink (1, 30), fixed to said connection and to the heatsink 

and delimiting between the heatsink and said connection an 
area (25) protected from pollution. 
Device according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the mechanical coupling is provided by resin filling said 

protected area (25). 
Device according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the mechanical coupling is provided by a foil (43) joining the 

heatsink (30) to the insulator (42) and by fixing the 
insulator to said connection (41). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the heatsink (30) has only one heat 

exchange side (40) and is in two parts, a first part (32) 
having a side constituting said heat exchange side and another 

side including a groove (33) in which cooling fluid can flow, 
and a second part (31) having one side covering the second 

side of the first part, said second part having cooling fluid 
inlet and outlet orifices (34, 35), a fluid inlet pipe (37)  

 
leading from the inlet orifice to an inlet of said groove and 

a fluid outlet pipe (38) leading from the outlet of said 
groove to the outlet orifice. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the heatsink has two heat exchange sides 

(18, 21) corresponding to two components to be cooled and is 
in three parts, a first part (12) having a first side which 

constitutes one of said heat exchange sides and a second side 
(23) including a first groove (17) in which cooling fluid can 

flow, a second part (13) having a first side (21) which 
constitutes the other heat exchange side and a second side 

(24) including a second groove (20) in which cooling fluid can 
flow, and a third part (11) having one side covering the 

second side (23) of the first part (12) and another side 
covering the second side (24) of the second part (13), said 

third part having cooling fluid inlet and outlet orifices 
(14, 15), a cooling fluid inlet pipe (16) leading from the 

inlet orifice (14) to an inlet of the first groove (17), a 
fluid pipe (19) between an outlet of the first groove (17) and 

the inlet of the second groove (20), and a cooling fluid 
outlet pipe (22) leading from the outlet of the second groove 

(20) to the outlet orifice (15). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the cooling fluid circuit is spiral in 

shape on one heat exchange side or on each heat exchange side.
