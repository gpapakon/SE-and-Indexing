<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of foam boards having a 
minimum thickness of 60 mm and a cross-sectional area of 

at least 50 cm
2
 by extruding a mixture of a styrene 
polymer, from 1 to 10% by weight, based on the styrene 

polymer, of a blowing agent and, if desired, 
conventional additives and/or auxiliaries, wherein the 

blowing agent used is a mixture containing from 5 to 55% 
by weight of carbon dioxide and at least 30% by weight 

of an ether from the group consisting of dimethyl ether, 
methyl ethyl ether and methyl vinyl ether, no 

chlorofluorocarbon or fluorocarbon being present. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the ether used 
is dimethyl ether. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the foam boards 
having a minimum thickness of 100 mm are produced using 

a blowing agent containing at least 40% by weight of one 
of said ethers. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein up to 30% 

by weight of ethanol is present in the blowing agent 
mixture. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
blowing agent used is a mixture containing. 


a) from 45 to 95% by weight of dimethyl ether and 
b) from 5 to 55% by weight of carbon dioxide.
