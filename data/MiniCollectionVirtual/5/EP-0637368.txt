<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (400) and method indirectly determines the amount of outside air introduced into the ventilation system of a structure to control the indoor air quality in the structure. Test gas concentrations, preferably carbon dioxide concentrations, are measured for return air, outside air and mixed (supply) air. The flow rate of mixed air is measured and the volume of outside air introduced into the system is determined through use of the test gas concentration measurements without directly measuring the volume or flow rate of outside air. Preferably, a single sensor (104) is utilized to measure each of the trace gas concentrations in the return air, outside air and supply air, and the various measurements sequentially multiplexed to a controller (46). Moreover, for calibrating the apparatus (400), a return air sensor (42) is calibrated to the outside air and a mixed air sensor (40) is calibrated to the outside air or the return air to eliminate inaccuracy due to sensor drift.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a method and apparatus
for controlling ventilation rates and indoor air quality in a Heating, Ventilation and
Air Conditioning (HVAC) system; more particularly, the present invention is
directed to a method and apparatus for controlling outdoor air flow volume in an
HVAC system using trace gas concentration sensing.Indoor air quality is, without question, a topic of necessary
importance. Not only are occupants of buildings, e.g., office spaces and the like,
increasingly concerned about and aware of health issues, but technical
associations have recently issued standards which specify minimum ventilation
rates for acceptable indoor air quality. For example, the American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) has
issued ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 entitled "Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air
Quality." ASHRAE standards are generally established to assist industry and
the public by suggesting safe practices, and conformance with them is
completely voluntary. Nevertheless, such standards are developed under the
auspices of ASHRAE and reflect a consensus reached by concerned interests
with respect to the topics contained in the standards. Moreover, many ASHRAE
standards, such as ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, are rapidly becoming
incorporated into local building codes.ASHRAE 62-1989 specifies alternative procedures for ensuring
acceptable air quality indoors: a ventilation rate procedure and an indoor air
quality procedure. Acceptable air quality is achieved in accordance with the
ventilation rate procedure by providing ventilation air of a specified quality and
quantity to a given space. Similarly, acceptable air quality is achieved within the
space in accordance with the indoor air quality procedure by controlling known
specifiable contaminants.In greater detail, ASHRAE 62-1989 prescribes supply rates of
acceptable outdoor air required for acceptable indoor air quality for residential,
institutional and commercial facilities. As set forth in the Standard, the supply
rates incorporate an adequate margin of safety and to account for health 
variations among people. These rates are a function of,
inter alia, the type of environment (i.e., smoking
lounge, office space) and the number of occupants. The
ASHRAE outdoor air requirements for ventilation range
from about 0,4 (15) (for example, in office reception
areas) to about 1,7 m3/min (60 cubic feet per minute
(CFM)) per person (in, for example, smoking lounges) as
being the minimum
