<ABSTRACT>
The purposes of this invention are to integrate the 
combustors and the air intake/exhaust passages in the 

thermally insulating engine into an assembly so that the 
space required for respective parts can be increased as 

well as to avoid complex structure. 
The space between the subcombustion chamber 3 and the 
main combustion chamber above the piston 1 is reduced by 

the base 11a installed above the piston head 11. 
In addition, a plurality of connection hole 21c arranged in 

an oblique radial pattern is drilled in the reduced channel. 
As a result, vortex is obtained within the subcombustion 

chamber 3 in the compression process. In the combustion 
process, the flame from the subcombustion chamber 3 is 

carried on swirl and expands within the main combustion 
chamber and thus mixes with air for combustion. In the 

center of the cylinder, the subcombustion chamber 111 is 
installed and surrounded by the air intake passage 112 and 

the exhaust passage 113 separated with the side wall 114, 
which is made of thermal conductive ceramic, of the 

subcombustion chamber. The single-unit structure is made by 
using the said ceramics for the outer peripheral wall 115. 

In addition, a plurality of the air intake 141 and exhaust 
outlet of 151 is provided on the piston side so that 

resrespective channels have wide opening. 
In other configurations, the combustion chamber and the 
air intake and exhaust channels in the thermally insulating 

engine are made into a single-unit structure, and two 
turbochargers, which allow flexible 
serial/parallel 
connection of the supercharge system to be performed, are  

 
installed so that a compact and highly efficient system can 

be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermally insulating
engine consisting of an assembly of a combustion chamber to
burn fuel in the internal combustion engine and its air
intake and exhaust passages.In an engine using combustion energy of fuel as its
power source, a considerable amount of energy is absorbed
by the engine. As a result, thermal expansion causes
deformation in the parts related to the combustion chamber.
Also, inconvenience such as abnormal explosion of fuel or
improper lubrication will occur. To prevent such
inconvenience, a cooling device using air or water as a
medium is used. Through this cooling, however, the thermal
efficiency of the engine decreases.Recently, thermally insulating engines capable of
withstanding high temperature and maintaining thermal
insulation have been developed by using, for example,
ceramics in the parts related to the combustion chamber of
the engine. Thus, it is attempted to increase thermal
efficiency and decrease the weight by omitting the cooling
device, which was conventionally essential for engines.With this type of engine without a cooling device, the
combustion chamber will require a thermally insulating
structure if higher thermal insulation is to be achieved.
In addition, the combustion chamber must be positioned in
the centre. The drawback of such an engine is that the
space for the combustion chamber and the air intake and
exhaust passages will be reduced, and their structure will
be complex.EP-A-0397521 discloses an engine in which a projection
on the piston extends into a hole connecting the main
combustion chamber with a subcombustion chamber.WO-A-85/02884 discloses a ceramic engine head.According to the present invention, there is provided
a thermally insulating engine, for which the areas near the 
combustion chamber are made of insulating material, the
engine comprising:
a cylinder, in which a piston operates;a boss at the centre of the top surface of the piston;a cup-shape cylinder head which covers the top of the
cylinder;a hole positioned on the central axis of the cylinder
head and into which the boss on the top surface of the
piston engages when the piston reaches top dead centre;a subcombustion chamber of ceramics which is installed
over said hole and connected to the main combustion chamber
formed by the said cylinder via said hole; and,a fuel injection nozzle for injecting fuel into the
said subcombustion chamber; characterised by:an air connection passage radially outwards of
said hole, either separate from said hole or formed as a groove
