<ABSTRACT>
The demultiplexing device receives information cells which consist of a header part containing an indication of the destination and of a data part formed by the useful information to be transmitted. This device includes: at least one input access (200) for receiving the said cells, a plurality of output access (1901 - 1906) for users, at least one network circuit (205) on which an entry access is connected and which includes a header analysis unit (310), a plurality of service circuits (230, 240) each of which is assigned at least one output access, a common line (220). It is characterised in that each network circuit includes a routing table (320) for supplying routing information, on the common data line, which information defines at least the service circuit for which the cell is intended, and a combining unit (325) for transmitting both the routing information and the said cells on the data line.

<CLAIMS>
A communication system comprising a network (100) and an information
demultiplexing device (160), which device transmits from one of its access points (150-155)

to another access point, information cells formed by a header portion (HD) containing
an indication of the destination and by a data portion (PL) formed by transmit payload,

which device comprises:

at least an input access (200) for receiving said cells,
a plurality of output accesses (190
1-6
) for the users,
at least a network circuit (205) which has an input access and comprises a
header analyzing element (310),
a plurality of service circuits (230, 240) to each of which is assigned at least
an output access, and
a common line (220),
characterized in that
 each network circuit (205) comprises a routing Table (320) for
producing on the common data line (220) routing information which defines at least the

service circuit (230, 240) that forms the destination of the cell, and a combining element
(325) for transmitting over the data line (220) both the routing information and said cells.
A communication system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
service circuits (230, 240) comprise a decoding element (330) for decoding the routing

information and for switching the cells to service elements (350-352) which form part of
the service circuit and which service elements are connected each to an output access

(190
1-6
).
A communication system as claimed in one of the claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 the common line is formed by a flat cable for the transmission of
routing information and another flat cable for the transmission of cells. 
A communication system as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that

a plurality of network circuits are provided and 
in that
 access time intervals for the common
data line are provided for the output of each of the network circuits.
A demultiplexing device (160), more specifically, for an ATM network
(100), which device transmits from one of its access points (150-155) to another access

point, information cells formed by a header portion (HD) containing an indication of the
destination and by a data portion (PL) formed by transmit payload, which device

comprises:

at least an input access (200) for receiving said cells,
a plurality of output accesses (190
1-6
) for the users,
at least a network circuit (205) which has an input access and comprises a
header analyzing element (310),
a plurality of service circuits (230, 240) to each of which is assigned at least
an output access, and
a common line (220),
characterized in that
 each network circuit (205) comprises a routing Table (320) for
producing on the common data line (220) routing information which defines at least the

service circuit (230, 240) that forms the destination of the cell, and a combining element
(325) for transmitting over the data line both the routing information and said cells.
