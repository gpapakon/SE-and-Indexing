<CLAIMS>
A method of driving a liquid crystal cell of the DHF
(distorted helix ferroelectric) type, characterized in that

driving is capacitive via a capacitance (8, C
ext
) which is
small compared with the capacitance of the liquid crystal

layer.
A device with a liquid crystal cell of the DHF
(distorted helix ferroelectric) type and a circuit for driving

said liquid crystal cell, characterized in that during
operation the cell is connected in series with a capacitance

(8, C
ext
) which is small compared with the capacitance of the
liquid crystal layer.
