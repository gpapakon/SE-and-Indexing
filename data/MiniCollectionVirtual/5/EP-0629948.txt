<ABSTRACT>
A method for managing concurrent accesses to a memory by several users sharing the processing time of a data processor so as each to execute a sequence of instructions of the said processor in order to read or write data from or into memory areas of the said memory on the basis of an index having a value identifying a memory area in the said memory. The sequence of instructions employs the following operations in order:   a) recording of the value of the index in a first memory register (20), b) summation of the contents of the first memory register with an increment value (30), c) recording of the result of the summation in a second memory register (30), d) atomic permutation of the value of the index with the contents of the second memory register (40), e) if (50) the contents of the second memory register are identical to the old value of the index, then take the contents of the first register as current index value, else recommence operations a), b), c), d), e).

<CLAIMS>
A method of managing concurrent accesses to a memory by a plurality of
users sharing the processing time of a data processor so that each of them

can cause a sequence of instructions to be performed by said processor for
the purpose of reading or writing data in memory zones of said memory on

the basis of an index whose value identifies a memory zone in said memory,
the method being characterized in that the following sequence of operations is

implemented in order in said sequence of instructions:

a) the value of the index is recorded in a first memory register (20);
b) the contents of the first memory register is summed with an
increment value (30);
c) the result of the summing operation is recorded in a second memory
register (30);
d) the index value is interchanged atomically with the contents of the
second register (40);
e) if (50) the contents of the second memory register is identical to the
old value of the index, then the content of the first register is taken as the

current value of the index, otherwise operations a), b), c), d), and e) are
performed again.
A method according to claim 1, in which the atomic interchange is
performed by a single instruction of the processor.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which the memory includes N
memory zones and the summing in operation b) is performed modulo N.
