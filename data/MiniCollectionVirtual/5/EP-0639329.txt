<ABSTRACT>
Methods for reducing nitrate nitrogen and oxalic acid 
contents in plants, each of which comprises applying 5-aminolevulinic 

acid, a salt thereof or a mixture thereof. 
Nitrate nitrogen and oxalic acid contents in plants having 

high nitrate nitrogen and oxalic acid contents can be reduced 
effectively and easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods capable of 
reducing, when applied to plants, 
the content of oxalic acid that spoils taste, nutrition and 
like qualities. Oxalic acid is an organic acid widely distributed in 
plants and takes part in the cause of the harsh taste of 
plants as a component of the "lye". In consequence, the 
oxalic acid content is one of the important factors which 
determine the quality of vegetables and the like. 
Especially, with the recently increasing occasion of eating 
vegetables raw in the form of salad and the like, great  
 
concern has been directed toward the reduction of the oxalic 
acid content in vegetables from the standpoint of taste. On the other hand, when vegetables are considered 
from the dietetics point of view, oxalic acid is not 
desirable because of its nature to inhibit absorption of 
calcium into the living body by forming an insoluble material 
through its bonding with calcium. Also, oxalic acid causes 
calculus because it occupies more than 60% by weight of the 
urinary stone components. In addition, since incorporation of oxalic acid into 
human body originates mostly from vegetables, it is important 
to reduce the oxalic acid content in vegetables. In the conventional cooking of spinach, komatsuna (a 
kind of Chinese cabbage) and the like, their oxalic acid 
content is reduced by the so-called "removal of harsh taste" 
in which water is allowed to slop over in boiling them, but 
merely about 20% of the total amount of oxalic acid is 
reduced by such a means. Though attempts have been made to produce vegetables 
with low oxalic acid content by selecting appropriate 
varieties and controlling fertilizer application, harvesting 
period and the like, satisfactory results have not been 
obtained yet. Also, very little actually is known about 
success in the development of a chemical agent which can 
reduce the oxalic acid content in vegetables. In view of the above, it is therefore an object of 
the present invention to provide a method which can reduce 
the content of oxalic acid in plants. Taking the aforementioned problem involved in the 
prior art into consideration, the inventors of the present 
invention have conducted intensive studies with the aim of 
finding a chemical agent which can reduce the content of 
oxalic acid in plants and found 
unexpectedly that 5-aminolevulinic acid, its salt or a 
mixture thereof functions to reduce the content of 
oxalic acid in plants to a satisfactory level. 
The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of
