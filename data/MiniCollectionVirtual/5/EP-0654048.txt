<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glycogen polysaccharides, the 
process for their preparation and their use. More particularly, 
this invention relates to glycogen polysaccharides 
substantially free of nitrogenous compounds and reducing 
sugars. The term "glycogen" is commonly used to mean a group of 
similar, but not identical, proteoglycans widespread in the 
animal kingdom. The most investigated glycogen is the one extracted from 
rabbit liver and it is believed to be a protein (glycogenin) 
having a molecular weight of about 37,000 daltons, linked by a 
glycosidic link of a tyrosine to a highly branched 
polysaccharide of glucose having a molecular weight of 
10,000,000 daltons (beta particle). Many beta particles, up to 
50, can aggregate together to yield a compound (alpha 
particles) having a molecular weight of 500,000,000 daltons, 
which is the unit of native glycogen (D.J. Manners, 
Carbohydrate Polymers, 16, pp 37-82 (1991)). The various glycogens of the different animal species show, 
as far as it is known, differences in the degree of the 
polysaccharide branching. Thus, for example, Stuart A.S. Craig 
et al. (Carbohydrate Research 179, pp 327-340 (1988)) reported 
significant differences in the polysaccharide branching of 
glycogen samples extracted from mammals and invertebrates. Indeed, although several different processes for the 
extraction of glycogen from animal tissues are described in the 
literature, they mainly have two different aims:  
 
(i) a quantitative extraction of glycogen with an analytical 
scope for biochemistry; that is, an extraction aimed at 
the subsequent quantitative determination of the level of 
glycogen in a certain tissue; (ii) the extraction of glycogen samples, minimizing the 
denaturation of the original polymer, for subsequent 
biochemical and conformational studies.  As a consequence, irrespective of their origin, in all the 
types of glycogen commercially available there is always some 
amount of nitrogen (500-600 ppm), which corresponds to at least 
that calculated for proteoglycan (D.J. Manners et al., as cited 
above). From an examination of the literature, a notable difference 
is found between the points of view of the various authors, 
some of whom consider the said amount of nitrogen as a trace 
impurity, and others who consider it a minor constituent of 
glycogen. On the other hand, the various commercial sources do 
not specify any difference between proteoglycan glycogen and 
its polysaccharide. While the extraction of glycogen has been thoroughly
