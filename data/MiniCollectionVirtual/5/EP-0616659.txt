<ABSTRACT>
The method relates to a method and a device for controlling the flow of a liquid. In a well (10) having at least one inlet (11) and one outlet (12) the area of said inlet (11) is adjusted in dependence on the liquid level in said well (10) by a floating body (13) controlled by said level. Said well is provided with an inlet tube (15) ended by said inlet (11), and at least one outlet (12), a floating body (13) arranged movable in a vertical direction in said well (10), and a slide (14) arranged in said well (10) in front of said outlet (12), said inlet tube (15) and said slide (14) being movable in relation to each other in dependence of a movement of said floating body (13) so as to close adjustably by said slide said inlet (11) of said inlet tube (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CONTROLLINGA FLOW OF FLUID.The invention relates to a method and a device according to the preamble of claim 1 and the preamble of claim 3, respectively.The sewage disposal system in practically all populated areas can functionally be regarded as combined systems, i.e. surface water in the form of for example rain and waste water is transported in the same pipe. Thus the flow in the pipes and the sewage system can markedly in¬ crease and exceed the capacity of the sewage system or the sewage treatment plant in case of for example heavy rain. Water has then to be diverted without actual sewage treat¬ ment, i.e. being overflowed.Since an actual control of the flow in the sewage pipes does not exist the overflow occurs without control and wastewater may reach small waters which can be very sensitive to this discharge. A considerable increase in flow in the form of shock load may also cause large pro¬ blems at sewage plants. The sedimentation and the nitrogen purification are for example affected by disturbances during heavy sludge escape which takes place if the flow is too large.By controlling the flow by means of devices for flow control at suitable points in the sewage system in order to vary the flow between zero flow and the full capacity of the pipes the flow can be adjusted or directed in a con- trolled way to for example a depot. Then overloading in both sewage systems and sewage treatment plants can be avoided and very large environmental and economical effects and advantages can be achieved.In order to avoid large flows in surface water pipes, for example after a cloud burst, devices have previously been suggested which comprise a well or a tank in which 

 some kind of suction siphon is disposed. Since the flow through the suction siphon is limited a control of the out¬ going flow from the well or the tank is effected. Such a process and such a device is shown and described in SE-B 370 430. Similar devices which make use of whirl chambers have also previously been used for flow control. It is also possible to mechanically control all orifices or spillways manually or by means of a engine. An exactly controlled flow from devices which work in this way with pipe or orifice openings or by means of spillway is achieved by varying the area of the orifice or the height of the spill¬ way dependent on the pressure head. This is, however, complicated and requires complicated control devices. The outflow of whirl chambers is also controlled by the static pressure head and when the
