<ABSTRACT>
In a portable telephone set (70) for use in 
combination with an IC card (90) comprising an IC unit (91) mounted 

thereon and a contact connected to the IC unit, the 
portable telephone set comprises a telephone body (71), the 

telephone body comprises a battery unit receiving 
portion, first and second holding portions formed on the 

battery unit receiving portion for holding the card, and 
a connector (77) mounted on the battery unit receiving 

portion. The portable telephone set further comprises a 
battery unit (80) which is removably attached to the battery 

unit receiving portion. The IC card is attached to the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a portable telephone
set for use in combination with a card which is
preliminarily assigned a telephone number.In Europe, such a portable telephone set is
widely used as a GSM type portable telephone set for an
automobile. The portable telephone set of the type is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 48309/1992
(Tokko Hei 4-48309) and is combined with an IC card which
is called an SIM card. Namely, the IC card is removably
attached to the portable telephone set. The IC card is
preliminarily assigned an identification number, for
example, a telephone number and comprises an IC unit
comprising a memory. The telephone number is
preliminarily stored in the memory. The portable
telephone set is supplied with the telephone number from
the IC card. This means that the portable telephone set
can use only when the IC card is attached to the portable
telephone set. In other words, the portable telephone
set is sharable by a plurality of possessors having
different IC cards which are assigned the different
telephone numbers. In this event, telephone charges of
the respective possessors are individually counted in 
accordance with the respective telephone numbers.In the meantime, the IC card is generally
attached to the portable telephone set by insertion
method. In the insertion method, the portable telephone
set has a card storage portion in which the whole of the
IC card can be held. In this event, the portable
telephone set requires an eject mechanism for ejecting
the IC card from the card storage portion. This means
that the portable telephone set becomes complicate in
inner structure and therefore becomes large in size and expensive.GB-A-2 251 505 discloses an apparatus for accepting and retaining a
memory card. A subscriber identification module (SIM) chip card reader has
electrical contacts electrically coupled to an electronic apparatus contained with a
structural housing, which e.g. belongs to a radio telephone. The SIM chip card is
aligned with the reader contacts and retained until an ejector knob is operated. The
SIM chip card reader is sealed to the structural reader. The card reader is used in
a radio telephone and is protected from rain or dust by the battery pack of the
telephone.EP-A-0,28,728 discloses a telecommunication device. The device
comprises a handset which has an opening for the insertion of a card as well as a
microprocessor circuit connected to a reading/writing device. This device is used
for reading and writing information stored in the card. With
