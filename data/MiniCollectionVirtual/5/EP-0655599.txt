approach trajectory (T) and the speed of such an

airborne missile (3), detected by the said detection
means (4, 5);
calculation means (7) for determining an interception
trajectory (t) which one of the said defence missiles

(2) has to follow in order to intercept the said
detected airborne missile (3);
means (10) for launching the said defence missile (2);
means (8) for guiding the said defence missile (2);
and
means (9, 11) for linking with the said defence
missile (2), while each of the said defence missiles

(2) includes a propulsion system (20), at least one
warhead (21), an inertial unit (22), a homing head

(26), steering devices (23), means for linking (22)

approach trajectory;
the central axis (AD) of the said homing head (26) is
inclined laterally with respect to the axis (L-L) of

the said defence missile (2); 
the said calculation means (7) estimate the moment at
which the said homing head (26) locks on to the said

airborne missile;
the said defence missile (2) is roll-stabilized, so
that the said central axis (AD) of the said homing

head is arranged on the side of the said airborne
missile (3); and
at the latest at the estimated moment of lock-on to
the airborne missile (3) by the homing head (26) of

the defence missile (2), the central axis (AD) of the
said homing head (26) is in the plane (CFD) defined by

the position (C) of the missile (2) at this instant,

the said common point (F) and the said point (D)
corresponding to the position of the said airborne

missile (3) at this instant, this latter plane (CFD)
serving as reference plane for the roll stabilization

of the said defence missile (2).
Air defence system according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the said calculating means (7) determining the

interception trajectory (t) of the said defence missile
(2):


start by determining the said point (F) common to the
said interception and approach trajectories (t, T);

then
in the vertical plane (AHF) passing through the said
common point (F) and through the site (A) of the said

defence missile (2) on the ground, determine the said
interception trajectory (t) of the said defence

missile (2) from the following three parameters:

the vertical distance (Z) separating the said
common point (F) from its horizontal projection (H)

on the ground (G);
the horizontal distance (X) separating the said
site of the defence missile (2) on the ground (A)

from the said horizontal projection (H) of the said
common point (F); and
the angle (α) which the intersection (tg) of the
said vertical plane (AHF) with the plane (π) normal

interception trajectory (t) between the said site of

the defence missile (2) on the ground (A) and the said
point (F) common to the said interception and approach

trajectories (t, T);
continuously calculate the flight time (DV) necessary
for the said airborne missile (3) to reach the said

common point (F) from its current position, by
following the said approach trajectory (T); and
actuate the said means (10) of launching the said
missile (2) so that the said means (10) perform the

launch firing of the missile when the said airborne
