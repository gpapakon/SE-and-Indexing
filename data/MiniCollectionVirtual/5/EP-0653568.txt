<ABSTRACT>
Wedge clamping member for the assembling of a 
first detail (5) and a second detail (6) to each other, 

at least one of the details (6) showing a T-slot (6.1) 
with flanges (6.2) running along a contact surface. The 

member comprises a primary wedge (1) showing a primary 
wedge surface (1.2) and a secondary wedge (2) showing a 

corresponding secondary wedge surface (2.2). The primary 
wedge (1) and the secondary wedge (2) are kept together 

for contact between the wedge surfaces (1.2, 2.2) by 
means of a screw (3). At least one of the wedges (1, 2) 

preferably the second wegde (2) can be caused to exert 
forces against the flanges (6.2) in tightening the screw 

(3), thereby jamming the members (5, 6) together. One of 
the wedges (1, 2) can be fixedly connected with one of 

the details (5, 6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamping member 
for clamping two details to each other, at least one 
of the details showing a T-slot with flanges extending 
along a contact surface and possibly even the second detail 
showing a T-slot with corresponding flanges extending 
along a corresponding contact surface. The clamping 
member is intended for clamping the details together 
along the contact surfaces, the T-slots adjacent to each 
other. On clamping of details onto surfaces showing 
T-slots, e. g. vertical columns of extruded aluminium 
with T-slots extending along the lengths of the column, 
it is known to arrange a washer which runs in the T-slot 
and which is connected to the detail to be clamped via a 
screw which is driven into a threaded hole in the washer 
referred to. On clamping the detail in question the screw 
is tightened in order to urge the washer towards the inner 
side of the flanges of the T-slot and to keep the detail 
by friction onto the surfaces being in contact with 
each other. In order to be able to tighten the screw in 
the fastening washer the detail to be clamped e.g. to a 
column has to be shaped for the screw to be accessible in 
a direction perpendicular to the T-slot, i.e. towards the 
contact surface of the column for the part in question, 
which means that the detail has to be provided with 
flanges, notches and the like where the screw head is 
accessible. Hitherto known fastening washers have the drawback 
that it is not always possible to arrange details 
adjacent to each other along one and the same T-slot 
without interfering in the construction of the detail 
which partly increases the price of the detail in question 
and partly makes it aestethically less attractive.  The object of the present invention is to 
achieve a clamping member according to the preamble, and 
which does not show the disadvantages associated with the 
hitherto known fastening washers. The object is achieved 
with a wedge clamping member for clamping a first detail 
and a second detail to each other, at least one of the 
details showing a first T-slot with flanges extending 
along a contact surface and the second detail showing a 
second T-slot with flanges extending along a corresponding 
contact surface. The invention is characterized in that the wedge 
clamping member comprises a primary wedge showing a primary 
wedge surface and a secondary wedge showing a corresponding 
second wedge surface, that the primary wedge 
and the secondary wedge are kept together for contact 
between

<CLAIMS>
Wedge clamping member for the assembling of a 
first detail (5) and a second detail (6) to each other, 

at least one of the details (6) showing a T-slot (6.1) 
with flanges (6.2), which runs along the detail (6), 

characterized in that the member comprises a 
primary wedge (1) showing a primary wedge surface (1.2) 

and a secondary wedge (2) showing a corresponding secondary 
wedge surface (2.2), that the primary wedge (1) 

shows a first contact surface (4.1) towards the second 
detail (6) and the secondary wedge (2) showing a second 

contact surface (4.2) towards the first detail (1), that 
the first contact surface (4.1) is directed towards the 

second contact surface (4.2), that the primary wedge (1) 
and the secondary wedge (2) are kept together for contact 

between the wedge surfaces (1.2, 2.2) by a screw (3), 
which extends in the longitudinal direction of the wedge 

clamping member, parallel to the contact surfaces (4.1, 
4.2) towards the details (5, 6), thereby causing the 

primary wedge (1) and the secondary wedge (2) via the 
contact surfaces (4.1, 4.2) to exert forces directed 

against each other onto the flanges (6.2) by tightening 
the screw (3) so that the details (5, 6) are fixedly 

clamped against the flanges (6.2). 
Member according to claim 1, characterized 
in that one of the wedges (1, 2), preferably 

the primary wedge (1), is fixedly connected with 
one of the details (5, 6), preferably the first detail 

(5). 
Member according to claim 1, the first detail 
(5) showing a first T-slot (5.1) with flanges (5.2) which 

runs along the second contact surface (4.2) and the 
second detail (6), showing a second T-slot (6.1) with 

flanges (6.2) which runs along the first contact surface 
(4.1), characterized in that the primary 

wedge (1) and the secondary wedge (2) are kept together 
to a separate unit by the screw (3) and form a separate 

 
elongated member and that the member comprises a slot (4) 

in each of two opposite sides, showing the contact surfaces 
directed against each other (4.1, 4.2), seperated 

by a bottom surface (4.3) in which the flanges (5.2, 6.2) 
of the T-slots (5.1, 6.1) are intended to run during the 

application of the member to the details (5, 6) to be 
assembled. 
Member according to any of the claims 1-3, 
characterized in that the screw (3) is 

driven into a threaded hole (1.1) in the primary wedge 
(1) and runs freely in a hole (2.1) in the secondary 

wedge (2). 
Member according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the screw (3) runs freely in a 

hole with a rectangular cross-section, preferably one 
mainly oval hole (2.1), the longitudinal axis of which 

extends in a plane parallel to the plane through the 
opposite sides with the slots (4) for the flanges of the 

T-slot (5.2, 6.2). 
Member according to any of the claims 1-5. 
characterized in that at least one stop 

member (7) is arranged on or in connection with the 
member being applicated to at least one T-slot (5.1) on 

one of the details (5) to be assembled. 
Member according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the stop member (7) is a springy 

member which is sliding along the T-slot (5.1).
