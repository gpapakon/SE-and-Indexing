<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control device for a gasoline level indicator 
consisting of a sinusoidal wave generator connected to a driver 

for an electromagnetic transducer. The transducer is able to 
receive signals relative to the fuel level from a float and is 

connected to a microprocessor which controls a driver for a level 
indicator, a driver for a reserve fuel warning element and an 

electronic control circuit. This latter is provided for driving 
further elements within an automobile engine compartment which are 

located in the vicinity of a gasoline pump.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic control device for a
gasoline level indicator.Various known indicator devices used in automobiles are
operationally associated with their tank.In this respect, Figure 1 shows a general block diagram of the
circuit of such a known device. Devices of this kind generally
comprise an electronic circuit, indicated overall by 11, connected
between a probe 12 and an indicator 13, which can be a digital or
analog indicator according to preference.The probe 12 is a rotary electrical transducer, or a differential
transformer consisting of a primary winding 14 and two secondary
windings 15a and 15b wound in opposite directions on a stator 16.
The primary winding 14 of the probe 12 is powered by a sinusoidal
voltage generator 17, with the result that the output across the
ends of the two secondary windings 15a and 15b is a variable-amplitude
voltage in phase with the rotation of a rotor 18. The
said secondary windings 15a, 15b are connected to a synchronous
demodulator 19 which supplies at its output a linear d.c. voltage
proportional to the angle and direction of rotation of the probe
12. The synchronous demodulator 19 is further connected to a variable
transductance circuit 20 to be able to control the indicator 13.In addition, a circuit 21 which corrects for the shape of the tank is
connected between the circuit 20 and the demodulator 19 to
linearize the indication of a level indicator or meter, not shown
in the figure, so correcting and adapting its response, it being
provided with the probe 12. The circuit 21 can obviously be
modified both for reliability for other tank shapes and for
adapting the fuel level meter. For example, US 4,344,136 describes an on-board
vehicular data processing system that samples
vehicular operating parameters, such as fuel level and
calculates values of other parameters, such as range
and travel time; system parameters may be stored for
future reference. It comprises sensing means for
picking up the operational data, data processing means
for receiving the operational data, means for
displaying the data and means for storing values of
the operational parameters. However, said data
processing system uses a large quantity of electronic
devices and, moreover, it cannot be located in an
engine compartment, for example, of an automobile,
because of its overall dimensions.Therefore, it is not possible to handle all the
functions of such a device within the engine
compartment, next to the gasoline pump but, on the
contrary, said device has the
