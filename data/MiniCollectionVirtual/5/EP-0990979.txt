<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the transformation of images
in order to produce caricatures.
The device 10 comprises a computer 80 and a component
supplied with a camera 50 providing the computer with an

image file, an interface 12 providing the computer with a
control signal, and a display device 40 for viewing a

caricature file coming from the computer. According to the
invention, the interface comprises a practically spherical

transparent envelope surrounding the display device 40 and
at least one sensor sensitive to the position of the user's

hands, and the computer is provided with a means to modify
the selection of the image transformation algorithm being

used by the computer when set conditions are fulfilled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to image transformation and more
especially to distorting faces for amusement purposes and
more especially for producing caricatures of the user's
face.It is common, in amusement parks, to let users produce
customized photographs. The appearance of computers in
combination with image processing software allows
photographs to be provided in which users can modify the
background or the environment in which they have been
photographed. Image processing software has also enabled
image distortion.The invention offers to provide users with the
possibility of easily producing distorted graphic
representations of a face, and more especially caricatures
of their own face or that of a well known person.The object of the invention is an image transformation
device that allows caricatures to be produced, comprising:
a) a computer capable of receiving digital files and
supplied with many image transformation algorithms for,
according to a control signal, modifying the digital file
and producing a displayable caricature file; and b) a unit
supplied with: 1) a camera for supplying the digital file
representing a person placed in the camera's field of view;
2) an interactive interface which the user can operate in
order to supply a control signal usable by the computer; 3)
a display device for displaying the image of the digital
caricature file sent by the computer; and 4) means for
communication with the computer for delivering the digital
file and the control signal to the computer, and the
displayable caricature file to the display device. This
device is characterized in that the interface comprises: i)
a transparent envelope enclosing the display device, and
ii) at least one sensor sensitive to the position of the
user's hands in relation to the envelope to produce the
control signal; and in that the device comprises a means 
for selecting the various image transformation algorithms
to modify the selection of the algorithm during use when
set conditions are fulfilled.In one advantageous embodiment the camera supplies a
representation of the face of the person placed in the
camera's field of view. More especially the person placed
in the camera's field of view is the user of the image
transformation device. In this case, users distort their
own image.In another embodiment, the person placed in the
camera's field of view is not the user of the image
transformation device. Advantageously, in this embodiment
one can either display the distortions generated by the
user on an auxiliary screen to

<CLAIMS>
An image transformation device (10) enabling caricatures
to be obtained, comprising:


a) a computer (80) capable of receiving a digital file
and loaded with many image transformation algorithms

for, according to a control signal, modifying the
digital file and supplying a displayable caricature

file; and
b) a component provided with:

1) a camera (50) to supply the digital file
representing a person (30a; 30b) placed in the camera's

field of view;
2) an interactive interface (12) on which a user
(30) can operate to supply the control signal useable by

the computer;
3) a display device (40) for displaying the image of
the digital caricature file sent on by the computer; and
4) communication means (14, 42, 52) with the
computer to deliver the digital file and the control

signal to the computer and the displayable caricature
file to the display device; and 
characterized in that

the interface (12) comprises:

i) a transparent envelope (18) surrounding the
display device; and
ii) at least one sensor sensitive (70) to the
position of the user's hands in relation to the envelope

to produce the control signal; and 
in that
 the device
comprises a means for selecting the various image

transformation algorithms to modify the selection of the
algorithm during use when set conditions are fulfilled.
A device according to Claim 1 wherein the camera is
arranged inside the envelope.
A device according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the selection
of the algorithm used by the computer is automatically

modified after a set period. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the selection
of the algorithm used by the computer is based on the

successive levels of the control signal.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims
wherein the computer comprises a memory to record the

caricatures produced.
A device according to Claim 5 wherein the recording is
released periodically.
A device according to Claim 6 wherein modification of
the selection of the algorithm used by the computer is

synchronized with the release of the saving of the
caricature file.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims
wherein the computer is linked to an auxiliary screen to

make the caricatures visible to a large number of
people.
The use of at least two devices according to any one of
the previous claims wherein each camera sends the

digital file it produces to another device and each
computer processes a digital file coming from another

device.
