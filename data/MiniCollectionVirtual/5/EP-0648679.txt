<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an opening arrangement of the type which 
consists of a pouring spout (3) formed from a thermoplastic material sheet 

(1) and surrounded by an outer closure portion (2). The outer closure portion 
(2) is sealed partly to the upper wall (4) of the pouring spout (3) and partly to 

a portion of the material sheet (1) surrounding the pouring spout (3). The 
outer closure portion (2) is provided with a failure impression (7) placed 

circularly around the outer closure portion (2) when this is sealed to the 
material sheet (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opening arrangement of the type 
which consists of a pouring spout which is formed from a thermoplastic 
material sheet and is surrounded by an outer closure portion, the outer 
closure or sealing portion being sealed to the upper wall of the pouring spout. It is previously known in the art to thermoform a pouring spout on a 
liquid package from, for example, Swedish Patent Application No. SE 
9100921-7 (EP-A-0 505 851). According to this method, a pouring spout 
is formed from a sheet 
of thermoplastic material, the spout being enclosed by an outer closure 
portion, a so-called screw cap. The thermoplastic material sheet may comprise the entire upper side 
of a package which otherwise consists of a packaging laminate with a core of 
paper or paperboard to which different layers are laminated, the outermost 
layer being thermoplastic. The cross section of the package may be circular 
or rectangular. The thermoplastic material sheet may also consist of a minor 
portion, covering a cut-out piece from a conventional laminate package so 
that it is welded in place against the inside of the laminate package of 
thermoplastic material. One such package may, for example, be a so-called 
gable-top package. In one of the above-described package types - which is finished 
inasmuch as it consists of side walls and a top wall, a pouring spout is 
formed in the top wall. A forming tool is passed through the as yet incomplete 
bottom of the package, and an outer closure portion (a so-called screw cap) 
is lowered from the upper side of the package, the closure portion serving as 
a mould for forming the pouring spout. When the pouring spout has been 
formed in this way, the upper portion of the pouring spout is sealed in place 
against the inside of the upper closure portion. This sealing or closure is 
intended to be broken when the package is opened. However, this method 
gives no external indication that the package has been tampered with or 
illicitly opened so that its contents might have been manipulated. Since this 
applies to packages for sensitive foods, it is often desirable to provide the 
package with an opening arrangement of the type which immediately  
 
indicates whether or not the package has been improperly opened before 
reaching the consumer. One object of the present invention is to provide an opening 
arrangement of the above-outlined type with a simple, visual indication that 
the package has not previously been opened and which does not impede 
opening of

<CLAIMS>
An opening arrangement of the type which consists of a pouring 
spout (3) formed from a thermoplastic material sheet and surrounded by an 

outer closure portion (2), the outer closure portion (2) being sealed to the 
upper wall (4) of the pouring spout (3), 
characterized in that
 the closure 
portion (2) is also sealed to a portion of the material sheet (1) surrounding 

the pouring spout (3); 
and that
 the outer closure portion (2) is provided with 
an impression (7) forming a predetermined breaking region. 
The opening arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the second seal (6) is of circular form. 
The opening arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the impression (7) is placed close to the circular sealing surface 
(6). 
The opening arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the impression (7) follows the circumference of the outer closure 
portion (2). 
A method resulting in the opening arrangement as claimed in Claim 
1, 
characterized in 
that
 both of the sealing surfaces (5, 6) are made in the same production 
phase.
