<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a luminaire having a housing (10) which has a profiled frame and light emission surfaces on one or two sides. The frame is composed of first and second frame parts (2.1, 2.2) which are held together by means of tension springs (4). In the corner areas of the housing (10), corner-connecting devices (3) are arranged. Part of the corner-connecting devices (3) is a first connecting part (6) which is connected to a first frame part (2.1) and a second connecting part (5) which is connected to the second frame part (2.2). The two connecting parts (5, 6) are mounted in the open state of the housing (10) in a first mounting position (7.1) and in the closed state in a second mounting position (7.2) inside one another.

Lamp with an approximately right parallepiped housing 
(10) comprising two first frame parts (2.1) disposed 

parallel to one another and two second frame parts (2.2) 
at right angles thereto and disposed parallel to one 

another, and at least one light-permeable wall member 
(1.1), there being disposed in the housing at least one 

luminous means (11), and the frame parts (2.1, 2.2) are 
provided with means (13) for securing light-permeable or 

light-impermeable wall members (1.1, 1.2), and with 
traction springs (4) disposed in the housing (10) and 

which hold the frame parts together by spring force, 
characterised in that there are present in the corner 

areas of the housing (10) corner connector devices (3) 
with two respective connector parts (5, 6) of which 

respectively a first connector part (6) is rigidly 
connected to one of the first frame parts (2.1), and a 

second connector part (5) is rigidly connected to one of 
the second frame parts (2.2), the first connector parts 

(6) being resiliently engageable in a first bearing 
position (7.1) on the second connecting part (5), so that 

a closed condition of the housing (10) is defined, and 
moreoever at a second bearing position (7.2) resiliently 

enagagable on the second connecting part (5), so that an  
 

open condition of the housing (10) is defined, in which 
the wall members (1.1, 1.2) may be removed. 
A lamp according to claim 1, characterised in that 
grooves (13) are present in the frame parts (2.1, 2.2) as 

means for securing the wall members (1.1, 1.2). 
A lamp according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that a corner portion (8) is respectively disposed in the 

corner areas of the housing (10), said corner portion 
being rigidly connected to a first frame part (2.1), and 

having an edge or surface (8.1) upon which the associated 
second frame part (2.2) abuts in the closed condition of 

the housing (10). 
A lamp according to claim 1, characterised in that one 
of the traction springs (4) is mounted at the respective 

corner portion (8), the traction springs (4) each being 
disposed between the two parallel oppositely-lying first 

frame parts (2.1). 
A lamp according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the parts (5, 6) engaging 

resiliently in one another in the bearing points (7.1, 
7.2) are so formed that the connecting parts (5, 6) can 

execute a rotary or tilting movement.  
 
A lamp according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the bearing points (7.1, 7.2) are 

offset in two directions perpendicular to one another by 
distances (a, b) so that, in the open condition of the 

housing (10), both the first frame parts (2.1) and the 
second frame parts (2.2) are at a distance from one 

another which is enlarged in comparison to the closed 
condition.
