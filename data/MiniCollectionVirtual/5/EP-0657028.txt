<ABSTRACT>
A method of marking a liquid and subsequently detecting that the liquid has been marked, which method comprises: adding to the liquid an additive comprising a plurality of particles in an amount no greater than 1 part weight of particles per 106 parts weight liquid, the particles comprising signal means to aid their detection and not being visible in the liquid to the naked eye; sampling a portion of the liquid containing said additive, and detecting the presence of particles in the liquid, with the proviso that said signal means does not consist solely of a nucleic acid tag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the marking of 
materials and in particular to a method of marking a 
liquid and subsequently detecting that the liquid has 
been marked. There is a widespread requirement to be able to 
trace the path taken by a given material as it moves from 
one location to another. In general terms, two broad 
categories of material movement are recognised: 
(i) The movement of materials as a result of 
natural processes occurring in the biosphere, e.g., the 
flow of water in sub-surface aquifers, the movement of 
sediments etc. (ii) The movement of materials which have been 
manufactured by man, i.e., items which do not occur in 
the natural environment or which are natural materials 
being transported as a result of man's activities. The 
former would include any item produced by man, and the 
latter items such as grain and other food materials, 
mineral ores and petroleum products, such as crude oil. In all these situations, there may be reasons 
why it is necessary to develop specific procedures to 
trace these movements. It may be that direct observation 
is not possible, e.g., when following the path of an 
underground stream. It may be that it is necessary to 
monitor the movement of goods without the direct 
knowledge of the transporters or, for legal reasons, to 
prove that the appearance of a material at a particular 
point in the biosphere was due to the same material 
originating from a known starting point. For example, it is undesirable and in certain 
circumstances illegal, for petroleum materials to leak 
from storage sites or transportation containers and 
contaminate the natural environment. Petrol storage 
tanks, e.g., at petrol filling stations, are usually 
located underground. Should one of these tanks develop a  
 
leak, the loss of material will eventually be detected, 
either by audits on the material being added to and 
removed from the storage tank, or by detection of spilt, 
leakage material at some site adjacent the storage tank 
area. Since the tanks are underground, visual inspection 
is not normally possible and it is a costly procedure to 
excavate successive tanks to determine which tank is the 
cause of the leakage. The normal procedure would be to 
develop a protocol whereby a known marker, e.g., a dye, 
is added to the tanks to determine, by tracing the 
movement of the dye, which tank is the cause of the 
leakage. Cheaper remedial action can then be taken to 
deal with the identified leaking tank. One feature of 
this procedure is that, in order to

A method of marking a liquid and subsequently 
detecting that the liquid has been marked, which method 

comprises: 

adding to the liquid an additive comprising a 
plurality of particles in an amount no greater than 1 

part weight of particles per 10
6
 parts weight liquid, the 
particles comprising signal means to aid their detection 

and not being visible in the liquid to the naked eye; 
said additive comprising two or more types of particles, 

each having different signal means or particles having 
two or more different signal means; one of said signal 

means comprising nucleic acid, and the other said signal 
means being other than a nucleic acid tag; 
sampling a portion of the liquid containing 
said additive, and 
detecting the presence of particles in the 
liquid. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 in which the 
particles are present in the liquid in an amount no 

greater than 1 part weight of particles per 10

 parts 
weight liquid and the particles have an average size no 

greater than 1µm. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 in which the 
particles are present in the liquid in an amount of from 

about 1 part weight of particles per 10
