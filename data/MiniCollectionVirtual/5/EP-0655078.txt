<ABSTRACT>
New organopolysiloxane compositions cross-linkable into electroconductive elastomers contain an organopolysiloxane mass which cross-links by addition into a non-electroconductive elastomer and (a) 11 to 30 % by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition, carbon fibers having 0.1 to 10 mm average length. These compositions are suitable for producing injection moulded bodies, such as ignition cable looms in motor vehicles and dots for telephone, computer and remote control contact pads.
