<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catalysts for use in reaction 
injection molding compositions containing internal mold release agents. Reaction injection molding (RIM) is a versatile process by which 
elastomeric and thermoset parts can be fabricated. The RIM process 
involves high pressure impingement mixing of a polyisocyanate stream 
(A-side) and an active-hydrogen containing isocyanate-reactive stream 
(B-side) followed by immediate injection into the closed mold. The 
primary appeal of this process lies in its inherently high productivity. 
One factor which limits productivity, however, is the necessity to spray 
the molds with external mold release prior to each injection. This is a 
time-consuming task and often has a negative environmental impact. This 
difficulty can be overcome by the incorporation of an internal release 
agent into the formulation via one of the two streams to significantly 
increase the number of molding cycles which can be accomplished between 
mold release sprayings. The use of metallic soaps as release agents has been known for a 
long time. Zinc stearate, in particular, is known to be soluble in 
aliphatic amines, such as the polyether polyamines and ethylenediamine-initiated 
polyols. This is the basis for its use as an internal mold 
release (IMR) agent in RIM. If zinc stearate is simply dispersed as a 
fine powder in polyol blends, it does not dissolve and does not act as 
a release agent. Various patents teach that zinc soaps can be compatibilized 
or dissolved in polyol blends with amines, enamines, 
ketimines or salts of amidines or guanidines, and that excellent 
releasability of the subsequent RIM parts will result. While the IMR approach is commercially applied, there remains 
significant shortcomings to the currently available IMR systems. The 
amine-solublized metallic soaps, which are most commonly used in this 
application, have been implicated in reactivity and/or physical property  
 
deficiencies for the RIM elastomers in which they are used. Furthermore, 
the high melting points and limited solubilities of the metallic 
soaps make them prone to precipitation in the RIM processing equipment, 
necessitating replacement of the piping regularly. Another class of IMR agents which has been reported includes fatty 
acidic materials. WO 84/03288 discloses the optional use of fatty acids 
in addition to metallic soaps plus amines. U.S. 4,220,727 discloses the 
use of fatty acids plus their alkali metal salts. U.S. 4,130,698 
discloses the use of fatty acids plus
