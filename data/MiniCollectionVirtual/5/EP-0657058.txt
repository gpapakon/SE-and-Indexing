<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to an active high transmission loss
system for attenuating noise radiation according to the precharacterizing
part of claim 1.The invention identifies an apparatus and method for controlling
sound transmission through (from) a panel using sensors, actuators
and an active control system. Active structural acoustic control
is used to control sound transmission through a number of smaller
panel "cells" which are in turn combined to create a larger panel.
The invention is a replacement for thick and heavy passive sound
isolation material, or anechoic material.This invention expands on the theory of active structural
acoustic control as in U.S. Patent 4,715,559 to Fuller. The Fuller
patent teaches the art of controlling sound by controlling the efficiently
radiating modes of a structure. Additionally, the theory
of utilizing PVDF sensors is used in the invention. Previous attempts at controlling large sound fields exist in
many variations.
Attempts by Jessel ("Secondary sources and their energy transfer,"
Acoustics Letters 4 (1981) 174-179) using control surfaces defined
by planar arrays of microphones and speakers show an attempt at
control from a non-compact source. Additionally, Davidson, Jr. et
al. (USP 4,025,724) teach a method by which noise from non-compact
sources can be controlled using a planar array of acoustic projectors
and sensors.A specific problem of a non-compact noise source which various
people have tried to address is controlling the sound of a
power generation transformer. This problem represents a non-compact
noise source, and thus is useful to evaluate previous methods
of non-compact noise source control. The creation of a sound
barrier around a transformer is by no means unique. The principles
described can be used in relation to the control of sound from
other non-compact sources.The control of transformer radiated noise is a problem whose
satisfactory solution still remains to be found. Larger transformers
consist of various configurations of metallic laminated
cores and electrical windings immmersed in an oil bath. The oil
volume is usually contained in tank designed as a rectangular-like
outer enclosure. Due to the magnetostrictive nature of the
electrical excitation the excitation of the core appears as a sinusoid
at twice the mains frequency plus harmonics. The winding
and core are excited by the fluctuating magnetic force. These
excite the oil field which in turn excites the outer casing. The
outer casing then radiates sound. Due to the nature of the
