<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus for recording data on and/or reproducing 
data from a recording medium (1) includes a recording and/or reproducing unit (3,6), a 

memory (13), a memory controller (12), and a servo control circuit (9), and a system 
controller (11). The recording and/or reproducing unit (3,6) records data on the 

recording medium (1) and/or reproduces recorded data from the recording medium (1). 
The memory (13) temporarily stores data outputted from the recording and/or 

reproducing unit (3,6) or input data to be recorded on the recording medium (1) by the 
recording and/or reproducing unit (3,6). The memory controller (12) controls the 

memory (13) to write and read data such that data are read from the memory (13) in a 
unit of time at a transfer rate lower than the transfer rate at which data are written in the 

memory in a unit of time. The servo control circuit (9) supplies a servo control signal 
to the recording and/or reproducing means (3,6), and has an adjustable servo control 

gain. The system controller controls operation of the recording and/or reproducing unit 
(3,6), the memory controller (12), and the servo control circuit (9). The input data are 

recorded on the recording medium (1) through the memory (13) and the data 
reproduced from the recording medium (1) are outputted through the memory (13). The 

system controller (11) temporarily interrupts the recording of data on the recording 
medium (1) or the reproducing of data from the recording medium (1) with the 

recording and/or reproducing unit based on the amount of data stored in the memory 
(13), and controls the servo control circuit (9) and the recording and/or reproducing 

unit (3,6) to automatically adjust the servo control gain while the recording or 
reproducing of data is temporarily interrupted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus and a method of controlling such a recording
and/or reproducing apparatus. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus for
intermittently recording and/or reproducing data.There are known a reproducing apparatus for reproducing
recorded data from a magneto-optical disc and an optical disc and
a recording apparatus for recording data on a magneto-optical disc.For reproducing data from or recording data on such an optical
recording medium, an optical head radiates a light beam to the
recording surface of the optical recording medium and detects a
light beam reflected by the optical recording medium to reproduce
the data recorded on the optical recording medium, or radiates a
light beam to the recording surface of the optical recording medium
to record desired data thereon. It is the customary practice to
effect tracking and focusing servo control on the optical head for 
controlling the light beam to scan the recording surface properly.The gain of a tracking or focusing servo control circuit,
i.e., the gain of a tracking error signal or a focusing error
signal generated by the tracking or focusing servo control circuit,
has to be adjusted to an appropriate level for good servo control
depending on the recording or reproducing apparatus.The adjustment of the servo control signal gain results in
adjustments of servo control characteristics such as servo control
responses and shock resistance to respective states, so that
suitable servo control characteristic states can be selected
depending on how the apparatus are used, the environment in which
they are used, and the disc used in the apparatus.Heretofore, the servo control signal gain has been adjusted
by varying the feedback resistance of an operational amplifier
through adjusting a semifixed resistor during an adjustment process
after the recording and reproducing apparatus have been
manufactured. If a recording or reproducing apparatus is equipped
with an automatic servo control signal gain adjusting circuit, then
the servo control signal gain is automatically adjusted when no
reproduced audio signal is outputted, e.g., immediately after an
optical recording medium such as an optical disc has been loaded,
or when no recording signal is inputted.Actually, the servo control signal gain cannot be adjusted to
a suitable level unless adjusted based on various conditions
including the environment in which the recording or reproducing
appar
