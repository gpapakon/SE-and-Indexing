<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of sterilization and more 
particularly to sterilization based on the use of ethylene oxide. Sterilization by the application of boiling water or steam to the article 
to be sterilized has been carried out for many years. More recently there has arisen 
in certain fields, such as in medicine and in space exploration, the need to employ a 
different sterilant because certain articles used in these fields cannot withstand the 
temperatures or the moisture associated with steam sterilization. One sterilant that has become widely used is ethylene oxide because 
not only is it an effective sterilant but also its residues volatize relatively quickly 
from the article sterilized. Although ethylene oxide may be used by itself to carry 
out the sterilization, this is generally not done because ethylene oxide is highly 
flammable. Instead, ethylene oxide sterilant is generally used in a mixture with a 
flame retardant. The flame retardant, however, must complement the properties of 
the ethylene oxide or the beneficial effects of the ethylene oxide will be lost. Over 
the last two decades the flame retardant of choice for use with ethylene oxide in a 
sterilant mixture has been dichlorodifluoromethane, known in the industry as 
CFC-12. The most commonly used sterilant mixture comprises 27.3 mole percent 
(12 weight percent) ethylene oxide and 72.7 mole percent (88 weight percent) 
CFC-12. This mixture is commonly referred to in the industry as 12-88. Recently a problem has arisen in the use of CFC-12 because it is one 
of the chlorofluorocarbons believed to cause significant damage to the ozone layer 
in the upper atmosphere. Accordingly, worldwide reduction and elimination of the 
use of CFC-12 is now underway. This has created a problem for the use of ethylene 
oxide as a sterilant. Alternative flame retardants have been proposed, but they are not as 
effective as CFC-12 in that less ethylene oxide can be mixed with these alternatives 
before the mixture becomes flammable. For example, the maximum amount of 
ethylene oxide that may be mixed with either 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane 
(HCFC-123) or 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124) before the mixture 
becomes flammable is 23 mole percent. For pentafluoroethane (HFC-125), the 
maximum amount of ethylene oxide that can be added to HFC-125 before the  
 
mixture becomes flammable is 19 mole percent, and for 1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(HFC-134a), the maximum amount of ethylene oxide is 12 mole percent.
