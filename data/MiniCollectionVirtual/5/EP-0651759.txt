<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to processes for the
preparation of 2'-O-substituted guanosines (in particular 2'-O-alkyl guanosines), 2'-O-alkyl
guanosine 3'-O-phosphorarnidites and oligonucleotides that comprises at least one
2'-O-alkylated guanosine nucleotide.A number of oligonucleotide analogs have been made.
One class of oligonucleotides that have been synthesized are
the 2'-O-substituted oligonucleotides. Such oligonucleotides 
have certain unique and useful properties. In United States
patent application serial no. 814,961, filed December 24, 1991,
entitled Gapped 2' Modified Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides,
assigned to the same assignee as this application, the entire
contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, 2'
substituted nucleotides are introduced within an
oligonucleotide to induce increased binding of the
oligonucleotide to a complementary target strand while allowing
expression of RNase H activity to destroy the targeted strand.In a recent article, Sproat, B.S., Beijer, B. and
Iribarren, A., Nucleic Acids Research, 1990,18:41, the authors
noted further use of 2'-O-methyl substituted oligonucleotides
as "valuable antisense probes for studying pre-mRNA splicing
and the structure of spliceosomes".2'-O-methyl and ethyl nucleotides and methods of
making the same have been reported by a number of authors.Robins, M.J., Naik, S.R. and Lee, A.S.K., J. Org.
Chem., 39:1891 (1974) reported a low yield synthesis of 2'-O-and
3'-O-methyl guanosine via a stannous chloride catalyzed
monomethylation by diazomethane. As was later reported by
Robins, M.J., Hansske, F. and Bernier, S.E., Can. J. Chem.,
59:3360 (1981), "convenient and high yield methods have been
devised for synthesis of the 2'-O- and 3'-O-methyl ethers of
adenosine, cytidine, and uridine... However, guanosine has
presented significant difficulties." In the foregoing paper,
the authors reported an improved synthesis of 2'-O and 3'-O-methyl
guanosine. The synthesis was improved by effecting the
stannous chloride catalyzed diazomethane methylation of 2,6-diamino-9-(Î²-D-ribofuranosyl)purine
(2-aminoadenosine) in place
of guanosine. The diamino purine moiety was then reduced to
the corresponding guanine moiety with adenosine deaminase. In
a further diazoation reaction described by Singer and
Kusmierek, Biochemistry15: 5052 (1976), a mixture of 2' and
3'-O-ethyl guanosine was reported to result from the treatment
of guanosine with diazoethane. The alkylation also resulted in
alkylation of the heterocyclic base . The alkylated product
