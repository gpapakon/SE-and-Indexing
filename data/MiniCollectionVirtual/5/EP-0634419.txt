<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for converting 
a high-boiling component, resulting from the reaction of an 

organochloride with silicon, into more commercially 
desirable monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the 

high-boiling component with chlorine at a temperature within 
a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. Improved process yield of 

monosilanes is obtained by the use of a catalyst selected 
from alumina, silica, activated carbon, AlCl₃ and AlCl₃ 

supported on a support selected from alumina, silica and 
carbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for converting
a high-boiling component, resulting from the reaction of an
organochloride with silicon, into more commercially
desirable monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the
high-boiling component with chlorine at a temperature within
a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. Improved process yield of
monosilanes is obtained by the use of a catalyst selected
from alumina, silica, activated carbon, AlCl3 and AlCl3
supported on a support selected from alumina, silica and
carbon.The high-boiling component useful in our present
process results from a process typically referred to as the
"Direct Process," where an organohalide is reacted with
silicon in the presence of a suitable catalyst to form
monosilanes. The Direct Process is described more
completely in US-A 2,380,995 and US-A 2,488,487. It is the
main commercial process by which organohalosilanes (i.e.
monosilanes), for example dimethyldichlorosilane and
trimethylchlorosilane, are formed. These organohalosilanes
are reactive compounds which can undergo numerous reactions
to form a variety of useful silicon containing compounds and
polymers. A major commercial use of organohalosilanes is in
the production of polysiloxane polymers which are useful as
heat transfer fluids, lubricants and the like and which can
be further processed, for example, to form silicone
elastomers, resins, sealants and adhesives.Operation of the Direct Process results not only
in the production of the desirable monosilanes, but also in
a high boiling component typically considered to be all
materials with a boiling point higher than the particular 
diorganodihalosilane produced in the process. The high-boiling
component is a complex mixture that includes
compounds containing SiSi, SiOSi, SiCSi, SiCCSi and SiCCCSi
linkages in the molecules. Typical compounds found in a
high-boiling component are described in US-A 2,598,435 and
US-A 2,681,355. The high-boiling component may also
comprise silicon containing solids and soluble and insoluble
compounds of copper, aluminum and zinc.In current commercial operations for performing
the Direct Process, the high-boiling component can
constitute as much as ten percent of the resultant product.
Therefore, it is desirable to convert the high-boiling
component into commercially desirable products to both
reduce low-value by-products and to improve raw materials
utilization.The prior art for converting the high boiling
component of the Direct Process into more useable
monosilanes is represented by US-A
