<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an OFDM synchronization
demodulation circuit, and more particularly to, an OFDM
synchronization demodulation circuit which obtains symbol
synchronization and carrier synchronization from information
signals.With the digitization in the broadcasting or mobile radio
communication, a digital modulation system has been developed
in recent years. In particular, in the mobile radio
communication, orthogonal frequency division multiplex
(hereinafter referred to as OFDM (orthogonal frequency
division multiplex) modulation which is durable against
multipass interference has been under the examination for
adoption. The OFDM modulation is a system to distribute
transmitted digital data in multiple carriers (hereinafter
referred to as sub-carriers) which are mutually orthogonal
and to modulate each of them. The OFDM has such merits that
frequency utilization factor is high and it hardly supplies
disturbance to others in addition to a feature that it is
hardly subject to the effect of multiple path interference.FIGURE 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional OFDM
modulator/demodulator.Transmitted data which is input through an input terminal
1 is, for instance, a QPSK modulated or QAM modulated signal.
The transmitted data is supplied to a serial/parallel 
converter 3 of an OFDM modulator 2, where the data is
converted into low speed parallel data comprising multiple
symbols. The number of symbols per parallel data coincides
with the number of sub-carriers. An inverse fast Fourier
transform (hereinafter referred to as IFFT) circuit 4
modulates parallel several hundred through several thousand
mutually orthogonal sub-carriers by parallel data. The
number of sub-carriers is set according to the number of
using points of the IFFT circuit 4. The transmitted data
which has been OFDM modulated by the IFFT circuit 4 is
supplied to a parallel/serial converter 5, where it is
converted into serial data and supplied to a guard period
adding circuit 6. The guard period adding circuit 6 adds a
guard period to the serial data in order to prevent the
multiple path interference and outputs the data to a
transmission line (not shown).FIGURE 2 is a typical waveform diagram showing the
transmitted data added with a guard period.As the transmitted data is modulated after distributed
into several hundreds or thousands of sub-carriers in the
OFDM modulation system, modulation symbol rate of
sub-carriers becomes extremely low and the period per one
symbol becomes extremely long. Because of the feature,
