<ABSTRACT>
Armatures for dynamo-electric machines are 
balanced during manufacture by measuring the unbalance 

of the armature assembly prior to winding the coils on 
the armature. The numbers of turns of wire in at least 

some of the coils subsequently wound on the armature 
are then adjusted so that the unbalance of the 

resulting coils compensates for the unbalance of the 

armature prior to coil winding. Alternatively, one or 
more extra turns of wire that are short-circuited at 

the commutator may be added to help balance the 
armature. In addition, masses may be added to the 

armature to ensure that it is balanced dynamically as 
well as statically.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and 
apparatus for producing armatures for dynamo-electric 
machines such as electric motors and generators, and 
more particularly to improving the balance of such 
armatures. The principal components of a dynamo-electric 
machine armature are typically a shaft, an axially 
slotted lamination stack or core mounted concentrically 
on the shaft, a commutator also mounted concentrically 
on the shaft, insulating end fibers at respective 
opposite axial ends of the lamination stack, insulating 
papers in the slots in the lamination stack, coils of 
wire wound on the lamination stack chiefly by passing 
through the slots in the stack with coil lead wires 
extending to the commutator, and a resin coating 
applied to at least the axial ends of the coils to help 
stabilize the coils. It is becoming increasingly important for 
such armatures to be well balanced about the central 
longitudinal axis of the armature shaft. This 
increased importance is due, for example, to a growing 
interest (on the part of motor manufacturers and users)  
 
in motors that operate more smoothly, more reliably, 
with longer lives, and at higher speeds. The 
traditional techniques for balancing armatures include 
subjecting the annular outer surface of the lamination 
stack to a turning operation to ensure concentricity of 
that surface with the shaft, milling one or more axial 
grooves in the outer surface of the lamination stack to 
remove material from the side of the armature found to 
be heavier, and/or adding extra resin to the coil ends 
on the side of the armature found to be lighter. It 
would be desirable, however, to assemble the armature 
in such a way that unbalance is eliminated or at least 
substantially reduced so that the required extent of 
the above-mentioned traditional balancing operations 
can be at least substantially reduced. For example, 
removal of large amounts of material from the outer 
surface of the lamination stack by annular turning or 
axial milling may reduce the efficiency of the 
resulting motor. Also, to the extent that different 
amounts of material must be removed from different 
armatures, these techniques are not consistent with 
producing motors having uniform operating 
characteristics. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of 
this invention to provide dynamo-electric machine 
armatures with improved balance. It is a more particular object of this 
invention to provide methods for assembling dynamo-electric 
machine armatures in such a way that their
