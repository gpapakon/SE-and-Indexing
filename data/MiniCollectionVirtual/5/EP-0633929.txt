<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing proliferating cultures of dendritic cell precursors is provided. Also provided is a method for producing mature dendritic cells in culture from the proliferating dendritic cell precursors. The cultures of mature dendritic cells provide an effective means of producing novel T cell dependent antigens comprised of dendritic cell modified antigens or dendritic cells pulsed with antigen, including particulates, which antigen is processed and expressed on the antigen-activated dendritic cell. The novel antigens of the invention may be used as immunogens for vaccines or for the treatment of disease. These antigens may also be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with United States Government
support under NIH grant AI13013 awarded by the National
Institutes of Health. The United States Government has
certain rights in this invention. The making of this
invention was also supported by the Austrian Government
through grants NB 4370 (Austrian National Bank) and P 8549M
(Austrian Science Foundation).This invention relates to a method of culturing cells
of the immune system. In particular a method is provided
for culturing proliferating dendritic cell precursors and
for their maturation invitro to mature dendritic cells.
This invention also relates to dendritic cell modified
antigens which are T cell dependent, the method of making
them, and their use as immunogens. Vaccines, methods of
immunizing animals and humans using the mature dendritic
cells of the invention, and the modified antigens are also
described.The immune system contains a system of dendritic cells
that is specialized to present antigens and initiate several
T-dependent immune responses. Dendritic cells are
distributed widely throughout the body in various tissues.
The distribution of dendritic cells has been reviewed in
(1). Dendritic cells are found in nonlymphoid organs either 
close to body surfaces, as in the skin and airways, or in
interstitial regions of organs like heart and liver.
Dendritic cells, possibly under the control of the cytokine
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor,
(hereinafter GM-CSF), can undergo a maturation process that
does not entail cell proliferation (2,3). Initially, the
dendritic cells process and present antigens most likely on
abundant, newly synthesized MHC class II molecules, and then
strong accessory and cell-cell adhesion functions are
acquired (4-7). Dendritic cells can migrate via the blood
and lymph to lymphoid organs (8-10). There, presumably as
the "interdigitating" cells of the T-area (8,11-13),
antigens can be presented to T cells in the recirculating
pool (14). However, little is known about the progenitors
of dendritic cells in the different compartments outlined
above.The efficacy of dendritic cells in delivering antigens
in such a way that a strong immune response ensues i.e.,
"immunogenicity", is widely acknowledged, but the use of
these cells is hampered by the fact that there are very few
in any given organ. In human blood, for example, about 0.1%
of the white cells are dendritic cells (25) and these have
not been induced to grow until this time. Similarly,
previous studies (20, 21) have not reported the
