<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminate
comprising in sequence a polyimide film, a heat-resistant
adhesive and a metal foil bonded to the
polyimide film through the heat-resistant adhesive.Polyimide films are well-known for their
outstanding properties such as heat resistance, low
temperature resistance, chemical resistance, electrical
insulation and mechanical strength. Such polyimide
films are widely used as electrical insulating films and
as flexible printed circuit substrates. In such
applications, the polyimide films are usually bonded to
a copper foil with an acrylic or epoxy adhesive and,
therefore, good cohesive strength in the film and good
adhesion are important properties.U.S.-A-3,389,111, issued to McKeown et al. on
June 18, 1968, discloses a polyimide composition having
improved corona resistance containing from 0.1 to 20% by
weight of an organometallic compound of a metal selected
from Group IVb or Vb of the Periodic Table.In the present invention, a very small amount of an
organometallic compound is incorporated into the
polyimide film to improve the cohesive strength of the
polyimide, after high temperature curing, thereby 
improving adhesion. The prior art differs in using much
larger amounts of an organometallic compound to improve
corona resistance of the polyimide film and does not
achieve the desired improvement in cohesive strength by
high-temperature curing.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a laminate comprising a strengthened polyimide
film having improved adhesive properties when bonded
to metal foils, such as copper, silver, gold or
indium, using an epoxy, acrylic or other heat-resistant
adhesives.According to the present invention, there is
provided a laminate comprising in sequence:
(a) a polyimide film containing an organometallic compound
selected from the group consisting of dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin
dilaurate bis-(tributyltin)oxide, tributyltin acetate, tetrabutyltin,
triphenyl antimony and triphenyl bismuth, wherein said organometallic
compound is incorporated into a polyamic acid precursor of said
polyimide and said polyamic acid precursor is cured at a temperature
greater than 350°C to form the polyimide, and wherein said tin, bismuth
or antimony is present in an amount of from 0.02 to 1% by weight based
on the weight of the film;(b) a heat-resistant adhesive; and(c) a metal foil wherein the foil is bonded to the
polyimide film through the heat-resistant adhesive with an adhesive
strength of at least 1226 N/m (7 pli) according to IPC
