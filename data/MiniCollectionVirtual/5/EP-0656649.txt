<ABSTRACT>
A field effect transistor is fabricated with a window pad layer (e.g., 9) 
that is patterned using a patterned dielectric (e.g., 11) with sublithographic spacing 

as an etch mask. Desirable attributes of the transistor include small junction 
capacitance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of field effect transistors and
particularly to the field of such transistors that have landing pads.As integrated circuits have become more complex, the individual
devices, such as field effect transistors, forming the integrated circuits have become
smaller and more closely spaced to each other. Simple shrinkage of device
dimensions was not alone sufficient to permit the increased complexity of the
circuits; new processing technologies and innovative devices were also required.An example will illustrate this point. The source and drain regions of a
field effect transistor must be separately electrically contacted. This is frequently
done by depositing a dielectric layer over the transistor, patterning the dielectric
layer to form windows which expose portions of the source/drain regions, and then
depositing a metal in the window. However, to minimize the substrate area used by
the device, the source and drain regions should be small. Short channel lengths,
determined by the gate width, impose a minimum separation on the windows. That
is, the windows must be relatively small and close to each other, but misalignment of
the windows with respect to the source/drain regions must not result in a window
exposing portions of both a source and a drain region.An innovative design which decreases the alignment accuracy required
for the windows is described in United States Patents 4,844,776 and 4,922,311
issued to K.-H. Lee, C.-Y. Lu and D Yaney. These patents describe both a device
and a method for making the device which is termed a folded extended window field
effect transistor and is commonly referred to by the acronym FEWMOS. In an
exemplary embodiment, a layer of a conducting material, such as TiN, is blanket
deposited after transistor elements, including an insulating layer on top of the gate
electrode, are formed. Of course, WSi2 could also be used. The conducting material
is patterned to form window pads which cover at least portions of the source/drain
regions. The window pads may be larger than the source/drain regions provided that
they do not contact each other on top of the gate electrode; they may also extend
onto the field oxide regions adjacent the source/drain regions. Improved tolerance
for window misalignment is obtained because the windows must expose portions of
the window pads which are larger than the source/drain regions. Additionally, the
window pads may act as etch stop layers thereby preventing etching into the
source/drain regions when
