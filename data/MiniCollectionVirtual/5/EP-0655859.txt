<ABSTRACT>
In a facsimile apparatus including a recording unit 
having a resolution higher than the resolution of an image 

received through facsimile communication, a facsimile control 
unit performs resolution conversion in the main scanning 

direction for the received data, adds a predetermined 
command to line data of the data, and transmits the resultant 

data to the recording unit. This command indicates the 
number of operations of copying the line data in order to 

perform resolution conversion in the sub-scanning direction. 
The recording unit copies the line data some number of times 

in accordance with the command, and develops the obtained 
data in a printing buffer. A recording head is driven in accordance 

with the data stored in the printing buffer, to 
record the image. It is thereby possible to shorten the time 

needed for data transfer from the facsimile control unit to 
the recording unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a data processing method and
apparatus in which processing of converting resolution is
performed for image data.Recently, facsimile apparatuses, in which a recording
system having a resolution different from that of an image
received through facsimile communication is used, have been
practically used. In some such apparatuses, a printer interface
is provided, and a recording unit can be used as a
printer for an external information processing apparatus,
such as a computer or the like. However, when using the
recording unit as an output apparatus for an image received
through facsimile communication or obtained by a copying
operation, resolution conversion must be performed when the
reading resolution of an image received through facsimile
communication or a copied image differs from the resolution
of the recording unit. In conventional resolution conversion 
in the sub-scanning direction, a main control unit of a facsimile
apparatus (hereinafter termed a "facsimile control
unit") adjusts resolution by repeatedly transmitting image
data for one line to the recording unit a plurality of
times.FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating resolution conversion
in the main scanning direction and the sub-scanning direction
in a facsimile apparatus.First, the ratio of the resolution of a read or
received image to the resolution in a recording operation is
as follows:
Main scanning direction: 8 pels (picture elements) รท
360 dpi (dots per inch) = 0.564Sub-scanning direction: 7.7 lines/mm รท 360 dpi = 0.543.In a facsimile apparatus in which reading resolution
differs from recording resolution, or a recording density
differs from resolution in facsimile communication, a
resolution conversion circuit is required because an image
must be recorded with the same magnification as that of an
original during a reception or copying operation. If
original data is developed from 9 bits into 16 bits in the
main scanning direction, and from 6 bits into 11 bits in the
sub-scanning direction, the magnification is as follows:
Main scanning direction: 0.564 x (16/9) 1.003Sub-scanning direction: 0.543 x (11/6) = 0.996, 
so that an image can be recorded with substantially the same
magnification as that of the original image.FIG. 9 briefly illustrates the concept of resolution
conversion when a read image is copied or a received image
is recorded. In FIG. 9, reference numeral 50a represents
resolution conversion in the main scanning direction. By
replacing a read or received pixel (picture element) 51a by
two recorded
