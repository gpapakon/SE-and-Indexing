<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode forming
method for a surface acoustic wave device (hereinafter referred
to as a SAW device), and more particularly, it relates
to a method of forming electrodes on a piezoelectric
substrate structuring a SAW device through a thin film
forming method.A SAW device utilizing a surface acoustic wave, which
is generally structured by forming an interdigital transducer
made of comb electrodes and grating electrodes of metal
strips on a surface of a substrate having piezoelectricity,
is widely applied to a television receiver or a video tape
recorder. A material for forming the electrodes of such a
SAW device is generally prepared from aluminum (Al), ordinarily
in the form of amorphous polycrystalline Al.Further, the SAW device is widely applied to a transmission/receiving
element or a resonator for a high frequency
domain in recent years, and expected as a filter for a
radio frequency band pass filter of a portable device for
mobile communication, for the purpose of miniaturization and 
weight reduction.Such a SAW device is used at a low applied power level
of about 1 mW when the same is applied to a television
receiver or a video tape recorder, while a high voltage
level signal is applied to a SAW device which is employed
for mobile communication, particularly for the purpose of
transmission. For example, extremely high power of about 20
mW is applied to a SAW filter for a cordless telephone (The
14th Symposium with respect to the fundamentals and applications
of ultrasonic electronics on December 9, 1993 held in
Japan). Therefore, high stress which is caused by a surface
acoustic wave is applied to the electrodes (Al electrodes),
to result in migration in the electrodes. Such migration
resulting from stress is called stress migration. This
stress migration causes electrical shorting, increase in
insertion loss and reduction in quality factor of the resonator,
leading to reduction in performance of the SAW device.In order to solve this problem, there has been proposed
a SAW device employing as an electrode material an Al film
or an Al alloy (e.g., Al-Cu alloy) film whose (111) plane is
parallel to the substrate surface and the orientation axis
is [111] (Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 5-183373 (1993)).In the aforementioned Al film or Al alloy film whose
(111) plane is parallel to the substrate surface, however, 
resistance against stress migration is improved but this
effect is not necessarily sufficient. Under the present
circumstances, therefore, awaited is an
