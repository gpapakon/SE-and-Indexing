<ABSTRACT>
C1-C4-alkyl nitrites can be prepared by reacting C1-C4-alkanols with nitrogen oxides involving oxygen, the process being carried out in a reactor designed as a scrubbing column, nitrogen oxides containing more than 50% of NO of the total amount of gram atoms N of the nitrogen oxides, oxygen and, if appropriate, inert gas being employed in the lower portion of the reactor. 5 to 60% of the total amount of the C1-C4-alkanol employed is also employed in the lower portion of the reactor in the form of vapours or of a spray, while the remaining C1-C4-alkanol is applied to the column head.

-C
4
-alkanols with nitrogen oxides 
and oxygen, characterised in that the reaction is 

carried out in a reactor designed as a scrubber 
column, oxygen and nitrogen oxides being fed into 

the lower part of the reactor, the nitrogen oxides 
representing a mixture of one or more selected from 

the group comprising NO, N

 and N
2
O

, of which 
NO is always present and that is in an amount of 

more than 50% of the total amount of gram atoms of 
N of the nitrogen oxides, the nitrogen oxides being 

mixed with one or more inert gases, the proportion 
of which is 0-90 % by volume of all gases used, the 

amount of oxygen being 0.15 - 0.3 mol per mole of 
the number of moles of NO which exceeds the number 

of moles of NO
2
, the amount of alkanol being 0.8 to 
2 mol per gram atom of N of the nitrogen oxides, the 

alkanol being injected at 5 - 60 % of its total 
amount in vaporous or atomized form like-wise into 

the lower part of the reactor and the remaining 
alkanol being fed into the upper part of the 

reactor, 10 - 150°C and 0.5 to 6 bar being employed 
and a residence time of the reaction partners in the 

reactor being set to 1 - 500 sec. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a pressure of 0.8 - 5 bar, preferably 1 to 4 bar, is 

employed and, independently of the pressure, 30 - 
100°C is employed and, independently of pressure and  

 
temperature, a residence time of 5 - 300 sec., 

preferably 10 - 50 sec., is set. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
NO is present in an amount of 51 - 100%, preferably 

70 to 100%, particularly preferably 80 -100% of the 
total amount of gram atoms of N of the nitrogen 

oxides. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the inert gas used is one or more selected from the 

group comprising CO

volume, preferably 20 - 70% by volume of all gases 

used. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the amount of alkanol is 1 - 1.5 mol, preferably 1 

to 1.2 mol per gram atom of N of the nitrogen oxides 
and, independently thereof, 10 - 50%, preferably 10 

to 30%, of its overall amount is fed into the lower 
part of the reactor. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
0.2 - 0.27 mol, preferably 0.23 - 0.25 mol, of 

oxygen are used per mole of the number of moles of

s fed a 
combined mass stream which contains the nitrogen 

oxides, the oxygen, the inert gas optionally present 
and the alkanol portion to be fed into the lower 

part of the reactor. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the alkanol portion fed into the lower part of the 

reactor is used in atomized form, the mean droplet

Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that
