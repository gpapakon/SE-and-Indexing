<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a medium for magnetographic printers, characterised in that it comprises a plurality (k) of elementary magnetic layers, having relatively hard hysteresis cycles with a marked threshold and saturation effect, the coercivity and/or thickness of the layers of which vary/varies as a function of the position of the layer on a soft magnetic substrate.

Medium for magnetographic printers characterised in
that it comprises a plurality (k) of elementary

magnetic layers having relatively hard hysteresis
loops, with marked saturation and threshold effect, the

coercivity and/or layer thickness of which varies as a
function of the position of the layer on a soft

magnetic substrate.
Medium according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
layers are of the same thickness, and of different

coercivity increasing in the direction of the layers
arranged in the depth of the soft magnetic substrate.
Medium according to Claim 2, characterised in that it
is used with demagnetisation lines having identical

gradients for each layer.
Medium according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
layers are of the same coercivity and of a thickness

decreasing in the direction of the layers arranged in
the depth of the soft magnetic substrate.
Medium according to Claim 4, characterised in that it
is used with demagnetisation lines having a gradient

decreasing in the direction of the layers arranged in
the depth of the soft magnetic substrate.
Medium according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that
the variation in coercivity is obtained by measured

addition of hypophosphites and/or adjustments to the
deposition current density in the case of layers

obtained by electrolytic deposition of cobalt-nickel
alloy.
Medium according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the layers are deposited by

vacuum spraying.
Medium according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the different layers are

separated by fine non-magnetic layers in order to
facilitate the deposition of the next layer and to

reduce the magnetic coupling of the various layers.
Use of the medium according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that for printing n
2
.k shades
of grey on a sheet of paper consists in using a soft

magnetic substrate coated with a medium having k layers
allowing to be obtained, as a function of the differing

thickness of the layers or the differing coercivity of
these layers, k levels of grey per elementary dot

defined by differing masses of toner retained per unit
of surface area, and a writing head for the image

elements with n x n dots.
Use of the medium according to Claim 9, characterised
in that the number n of dots is equal to 2 and the

number k of layers is equal to 3.
Use of the medium according to Claim 9, characterised
in that the number n of dots is equal to 2, the number

k of layers is equal to 2.
