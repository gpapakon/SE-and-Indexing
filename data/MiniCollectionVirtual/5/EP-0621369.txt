<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fine-particle retention aids for paper-making 
processes, comprising phenolic compounds. It is known that a polyalkyleneoxide used in conjunction with phenol- or napthol-formaldehyde 
resin, in pulp containing alum and rosin size, provides an effective 
retention aid for fine particles involved in paper-making pulp. Phenolic resins with 
sulfur or formaldehyde are described in U.S. Patent 4,070,236 as being useful as 
additives for improving fine-particle retention in paper manufacturing when used in 
conjunction with a poly(alkylene oxide) having a molecular weight of 4 to 7 million, 
specifically the preferred poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or co-condensed 
polyethylene/polypropylene oxide; poly(propylene oxide) is mentioned (but there would 
appear to be a problem of solubility with polyalkylene oxides other than poly(ethylene 
oxide)). K. R. Stack, L. A. Dunn, and N. K. Roberts, show in "Study of the Interaction 
Between Poly(ethylene oxide) and Phenol-Formaldehyde Resin", Colloids and 
Surfaces (61), 1991, pp 205-218, describe how varying the environment and certain 
properties of the phenol-formaldehyde resin can affect the performance of a phenol-formaldehyde 
resin/PEOretention aid composition. T. Lindstrom and G. Glad-Nordmark 
in "Network Flocculation and Fractionation of Latex Particles by Means of a 
Polyethyleneoxide-Phenolformaldehyde Resin Complex", J. Colloid and Interface 
Science, Vol. 97, No. 1, Jan. 1984, pp 62-67 propose a mechanism they refer to as a 
"... transient network ..." of hydrogen bonded poly(ethylene oxide) and phenol-formaldehyde 
resin which sweeps fine particles from the system. The references indicate that the effectiveness of poly(ethylene oxide) for 
improving fine particle retention, in conjunction with phenol- or napthol-formaldehyde  
 
resins, increases with its molecular weight; the effectiveness below a MW of 2 million 
being poor and a MW of 4 to 7 million being desirable. However, the combination of phenol-formaldehyde resin and poly(ethylene 
oxide) functions less effectively as the pH is reduced below 5. The resin component 
also introduces environmentally-hazardous formaldehyde or napthol into the 
papermaking system. There is therefore a need for a new retention aid that avoids the introduction of 
hazardous substances such as formaldehyde, and that can function at a lower pH, 
such as under 5, as well as at higher pH levels conventionally used in paper-making. According to the invention, a paper-making furnish containing a
