<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns double pusher centrifuges which have a rotating sieve drum (6) and separate a mixture (17) into fluid and into a solid component (40) in the form of filter cakes (14, 15). A centrally arranged pusher floor which moves backwards and forwards along the axis (10) of a sieve drum (6), pushes away outwards, on alternate sides, with its outer annular area the filter cake (14) which has been formed since the last time the drum area was cleared. In this process, the pusher floor has at the level of the filter cake a plurality of axial through-openings (12) which are each supplied with mixture via radial feed openings (13) associated with them. The diversion into the axial through-openings takes place forcibly in response to the resistance at the outlet which on the ejecting side is large in comparison with the filter cake (14) present there while on the opposite side a cavity (16) is produced behind the pusher floor which comes away, into which cavity (16) the mixture can flow. Distribution takes place forcibly, there being sufficient pressure, as a result of the high circumferential speed in the through-openings (12), to compensate slight differences in the levels on each side.

A double sliding centrifuge having a rotating screening
drum (6) for performing a separation of mixture (17) into

liquid (39) and solids content (40) in the form of filter
cakes (14, 15), having a centrally disposed sliding floor

device (5), which moves to and fro along the axis (9) of
the screening drum (6), in order to push the filter cakes

(14, 15) away alternately with an outer annular region
(10), and having a central feed unit (11) for feeding new

mixture (17) into empty spaces (16), which are produced
behind the returning outer annular region (10),
characterised in that
 several axial through-apertures
(12) are mounted on both sides in the outer annular

region (10) of the sliding floor device (5), which can be
fed from the centre via associated radial feed apertures

(13) inside the sliding floor device (5) and which divert
the mixture (17) on both sides in the axial direction in

order to convey it contrary to the ejection motion of the
sliding floor device (5) on that drum side on which the

sliding floor presently moves away from the filter cake.
A double sliding centrifuge according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the radial feed apertures (13)
inside the sliding floor device (5) branch from a common

annular space (18), which can be supplied with mixture
(17) from the central feed unit (11).
A double sliding centrifuge according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 in the centre the sliding floor
device (5) comprises an opening (34) for a fixed

supporting pipe (20), in which at least one axially
displaceable pipe (19) allows the introduction of washing

and/or rinsing liquid. 
A double sliding centrifuge according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the supporting pipe (20) penetrates
the central feed device (11) and comprises at least one

deflector (33) for mixture (17) at the opening (34)
inside the sliding floor device.
A double sliding centrifuge according to one of Claims 1
to 4,
characterised in that
 the through-apertures (12) in the
outer annular region (10) have the form of ring slot

portions (30).
A double sliding centrifuge according to one of Claims 2
to 5,
characterised in that
 the annular space (18) is formed
from a double-walled sliding floor device (5).
A double sliding centrifuge according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the sliding floor device (5) in the
outer annular region (10) is constructed with double

walls and with an end strip (35).
A double sliding centrifuge according to one of Claims 2
to 5,
characterised in that
 the annular space (18) is formed by
a cover placed in the sliding floor device (5).
A double sliding centrifuge according to one of Claims 1
to 8,
characterised in that
 wearing rings (38) can be mounted
in the outer annular region (10), with which the axial

outlet height from the axial through-apertures (12) can
be adjusted in relation to the inner surface of the

screening drum. 
A double sliding centrifuge according to one of
Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that
 parallel to the sliding floor
device (5) there is an axially displaceable annular

channel (37) for collecting and distributing washing
liquid (21a).
