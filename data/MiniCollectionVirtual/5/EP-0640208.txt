<ABSTRACT>
For an automatic carrying out of successive NIR-analyses of material samples, it is known to feed the samples to a test chamber having a window located adjacent to the optical head of an NIR-analyser, this window being kept clean in being covered by a film that is advanced a full stop prior to each new sample filling of the chamber. According to the invention a simplified technique is used where the window is constituted by the front glass (68) of the optical head, this head being mounted in a box (6) which is movable past a simple cleaning unit (86, 88). With the invention it is possible to adapt an existing laboratory equipment (2, 10) to on-line operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A system for effecting automatic sample analysis and a method of establishing the system.The present invention relates to a sampling and analysing equipment for use in systems for receiving raw materials, in particular biological materials, and delivering the same in smaller portions or delivering materials in mixed or processed condition. In WO/89/11090 is already described the advantages of using an automatic sampling equipment, from which samples of newly received materials can be rapidly transferred to a central analysing station, wherein the single samples are quickly analysed, thus enabling a quality determina¬ tion of the new materials as a basis for a correct accounting in view of the qualities as well as for a rapid adjustment of processing or mixing conditions, should the new materials exhibit changed properties, e.g. regarding their contents of fat, water or protein, a typical relevant enterprise being one preparing fodder mixtures for livestock.The equipment disclosed in the said WO publication is relatively expensive, and it is well applicable in large enterprises, but in practice it is not suited for use in smaller enterprises, where it will be an economical overload to arrange for automatic samplers and a pneumatic conveyor system between the sampling system and the analysing equipment. At least to a certain extent it is fully acceptable to manually carry the samples to the analysing equipment, and the latter may well be simplified.In connection with the invention it has been recognized that in fact it is possible to modify an existing laboratory equipment so as to make it usable for automatic, successive sample handling and analysing, 

 such that with a relatively modest investment it is still possible to achieve a noticeable increase of the analysing capacity with a minimum of labouring.Especially two laboratory units are here in focus, viz. an analyzer based on the so-called NIR principle and a grinding mill for comminuting the material to be analysed. In their known standard designs both of these units require a careful manual cleaning prior to each new operation, and for the invention it is decisive that the required cleaning can take place automatically immediately after each operation, such that the equipment will rapidly be ready for handling a new material sample, without this being unduly contaminated by remnants of the previously handled sample material.The commonly used grinding mills are highly unfit for being cleaned in a simple and automatic manner. These mills have a

C L A I M S :
1. A system for on-line analysing of material samples, comprising an analyser unit based on the NIR principle or a corresponding optical analysing method and, upstream of that unit, a grinding mill for comminuting the sample material fed to the analyser unit, characterised in that the mill is designed so as to self emptying and self cleaning and that the analys¬ ing unit is divided in a first housing, which holds the optical system of the unit and is movably arranged relative to a receiving chamber for discharge material from the mill, and a second housing holding the remain¬ ing parts of this unit, the first housing being movable between a working position, in which a front glass of the optical system closes a wall opening in the receiver chamber, and a cleaning position, in which the front glass cooperates with means for cleaning the glass.
2. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the cleaning means comprise a diversion edge or roller for an impregnated cleaning web, projecting from a cleaning housing having driving means for advancing this web and being movable relative said first housing for effecting a scraping movement of the projecting part of the cleaning web over said front glass.
3. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the optical system in the first housing is mounted in such a shiftable manner behind the front glass that for each operation it is shiftable between two or more operative positions, which are mutually entirely or substantially non-overlapping.
4. A system according to claim 1, characterized in 


 that the receiving chamber is dimensioned for receiving successive sample portions of the magnitude 200-500 ml.
5. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that above the the receiving chamber there is provided a homogenisation mixer for the material supplied from the mill, preferably a cylindrical mixing device of the double screw type.
6. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the mill is constituted by a modified laboratory mill , provided with insert portions for forming around the screen an annular channel having a cross sectionally rounded outer wall and a tangential outlet, said insert portions being provided with inlets for compressed air and preferably also with heating means.
7. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that it is constructed as a modular unit (A) and is connected with another modular unit (B) , which holds a mill for comminution of coarse material and a divider for out-separating a portion of the discharge product and delivering this portion to the first modular unit, viz. preferably a portion amounting to 1/10 - 1/25 of the sample portion treated by the mill.
8. A system according to claim 7 and further connected with external samplers or sample terminals, characterized in that these are connected to the respective modular units all according to the coarseness of the associated materials, and that samplers for material to the first modular unit (a) are designed to operated with sample portions that are considerably smaller than the sample portions for the other modular unit (b) .
9. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that it is discharge connected with a discharging unit (D) , which is operable to selectively deliver the relatively small sample portions to a scrap container or to test cups, respectively. 


 10. A method of establishing a system according to claim 1, characterized in that an already existing, operative analyser is modified for the purpose and taken in use, preferably together with an associated grinding mill according to claim 6, the already existing calibration of the analyser preferably being maintained.
