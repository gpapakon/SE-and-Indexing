<ABSTRACT>
All the air is compressed to a first high pressure and is then separated into two fractions. The first fraction, constituting at least 70% of the throughput, is supercompressed to a second high pressure and cooled in a heat-exchange line (6) to an intermediate temperature, at which a part is turbined (at 4) at the medium pressure whereas the rest is liquefied. The second fraction is cooled and liquefied (20A) in a heat-exchange line, in one or more flows, at one or more pressures lying between the said first high pressure and the said second high pressure.

Process for the production of gaseous oxygen under
a high oxygen pressure by distilling air in a double-column

unit (7) comprising a medium-pressure column
(8), which operates at a pressure called medium

pressure, and a low-pressure column (9), which operates
at a pressure called low pressure, pumping (at 12)

liquid oxygen withdrawn from the bottom of the low-pressure
column (9), and vaporizing (at 6) the

compressed liquid oxygen by heat exchange with air in a
heat exchange line (6) of the unit, in which process:


all of the air to be distilled is compressed by
means of a main air compressor (1) of the unit to a

first high pressure substantially higher than the
medium pressure, and this is divided into a first and a

second fraction;
the said first fraction is pressurized further
to a second high pressure; and
the entire first fraction is cooled in the heat
exchange line down to an intermediate temperature, at

which temperature one portion is expanded in a first
turbine (4) down to the medium pressure, then fed into

the medium-pressure column (8), while the remainder
continues its cooling and is liquefied, expanded in an

expansion valve (21) and fed into the double-column (7);
the said first fraction representing at least 70% of

the flow of treated air, and in which process the said
second fraction is cooled and liquefied in a single 

stream at the said first high pressure and, after
expansion in an expansion valve (21A), it is fed into

the double column.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the gaseous fraction of the air from the first
turbine (4) is expanded in a second turbine (36), down

to the low pressure, this gaseous fraction being partly
warmed before its expansion in the second turbine, and

the output from the latter turbine being injected into
the low-pressure column (9), possibly after cooling.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the air is brought to the first high pressure
by means of only some of the stages of the air

compressor (1), the air is purified of water and of
carbon dioxide (at 2) at this first high pressure, and

then the said first fraction is compressed by means of
the last stage or stages of this compressor.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 at least some of the air leaving the last stage of
the compressor (1) is furt
her pressurized by means of a
blower (5), coupled to the first turbine (4).
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the said second fraction is precooled
by means of a refrigerating unit (6A) before it

is fed into the heat exchange line (6).
