<ABSTRACT>
A method for increasing stitches at intermediate position in a row 
of stitches of a rib knit fabric comprises steps of:

 
   making unoccupied a set of two target knitting needles (F,f) on the front 

and rear beds respectively where increased stitches are formed by 
shifting a predetermined number of loops from the knitting needles 

including the target needles in either leftward or rightward direction;
 

   forming stitches on knitting needles from one end of a knitting 
area to before the two target knitting needles;

 
   hooking a thread of yarn on first one (f) of the unoccupied target 

knitting needles located next to the knitting needle to which the thread 
has been supplied at the end of the preceding course;

 
   hooking the thread on the other (F) unoccupied target knitting needle; 

and
 

   moving a carriage in a reverse direction and applying the thread 
again to the first target knitting needle to form an increased stitch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for increasing the number
of stitches of a rib knit fabric using knitting needles of front and
rear needle beds on flat knitting machine.In knitting a fabric with a flat knitting machine, it is known to
increase the stitches for shaping a knitted fabric with addition of
wales.For increasing the stitches, there are two major methods: one for
making an increased stitch on an unoccupied knitting needle located
outside the end of a row of stitches to extend the length of the row
and the other for shifting a predetermined number of stitches of a row
including a stitch at the end of a row in outside direction to make
unoccupied knitting needles at intermediate of- the knitted row and
forming loops on the unoccupied knitting needles.In the former method, the edge of a knitted fabric is added with a
new wale upon increasing stitches and does not give a neat appearance.
The latter method produces additional wales in the middle of a knitted
fabric, thus leaving the selvages at both edges intact.Apparently, the latter method is advantageous over the former
method in appearance and efficiency for joining a plurality of knitted
fabrics to each other and is now widely used for fabricating common
garments.With the use of such a two-needle-bed type flat knitting machine as 
assigned in the present invention, stitches can be increased on both
the front and rear needle beds simultaneously and equally.A conventional method will be explained referring to a rib knitting
shown in Fig. 10.After repeating a desired number of times a couple of courses shown
in Fig. 10-1 and 10-2, rows of stitches are completed forming a size of
rib fabric. Then, the loop on the knitting needle B at the end of the
last row of the rib knit fabric is transferred to a knitting needle a
next to the opposite knitting needle b of the rear needle bed. After
the rear bed is racked to the direction of the knitting needle a (to
the left in the drawings), the loop is moved from the knitting needle a
to a knitting needle A of the front bed. As the result, the loop is
shifted from the needle B to the needle A in the leftward direction and
the needle B becomes unoccupied.By repeating this procedure on each loop with a series of racking
actions, a desired number of loops of the row are shifted to the left
so that the two opposite knitting needles F and f hold no thread of
yarn as shown in Fig. 10-3.In the next step shown in Fig. 10-4, the thread is passed along
the front knitting needles A to P and the rear knitting

<CLAIMS>
A method for increasing stitches at an intermediate position in a row of
stitiches of a rib knit fabric using a flat knitting machine which has at least a pair of

front and rear needle beds, either or both of the needle beds being movable to left and
right, comprising a step of making unoccupied a set of two opposed target knitting

needles (f,F;Fig 1-3:F,f;Fig 4-3:f,F;Fig 7-3) one on the front and rear beds
respectively, where increased stitches are formed by shifting a predetermined number

of loops from the knitting needles including the target needles in either leftward or
rightward direction, and is characterised by steps for forming increased stitches

comprising:

forming stitches on knitting needles from one end of a knitting area to before
the two target knitting needles (f,F; Fig 1-4:F,f;Fig 4-4:f,F; Fig 7-4);
hooking a thread of yarn on a first one of the unoccupied target knitting needles
(f,Fig 1-4:F, Fig 4-4:f, Fig 7-4) located next to the knitting needle (e,Fig 1-4:E, Fig 4-4:e,

Fig 7-4 ) to which the thread has been supplied at the end of the preceding course;
hooking the thread on the other unoccupied target knitting needle (F,Fig 1-6:f,Fig
4-4:F, Fig 7-4); and moving a carriage in a reverse direction and applying the

thread again to the first target knitting needle to form an increased stitch (f, Fig 1-6, F,
Fig 4-5, f, Fig 3-6).
A method for increasing stitches at an intermediate position in a row of
stitches of a rib knit fabric of claim 1, characterised by steps for forming increased

stitches comprising:

forming stitches from one end of a knitting area to before one of the 
two opposed target knitting needles (f, Fig 1-4) that is located at the further side in

the forward direction of the carriage;
hooking a thread of yarn on the further side unoccupied target knitting needle
(f, Fig 1-4) located next to the knitting needle (e, Fig 1-4) to which the thread has

been supplied at the end of the preceding course;
moving the carriage in a reverse direction and locating the feeder of the thread
to before the other unoccupied target knitting needle (F, Fig 1-5) for preparation of a

succeeding course;
moving the carriage in the forward direction and hooking the thread on the
other target knitting needle (F, Fig 1-6); and
forming a knit stitch on the further side target knitting needle (f, Fig 1-6) on

of the carriage;
hooking a thread of yarn on the nearer side unoccupied target knitting needle
