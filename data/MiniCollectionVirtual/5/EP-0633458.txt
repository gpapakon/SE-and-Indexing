<ABSTRACT>
The transmission mechanism of the device is supported in two bridges (9, 12) designed as stamped bending parts. Pivots (23, 33) are in each case supported on one side in a single-piece bearing spring (25, 31), which allows a simple, play-free and low-friction bearing with simple construction. The bridges (9, 12) are joined together by means of orientation elements and are snapped together into elastic holding tongues (5) and held in the desired position. The pivot (23) can be adjusted axially, using its bearing screw (22) and thanks to its bearing in the bearing spring (25), in order to adjust the transmission ratio in the transmission mechanism. The bearing screw (22) of the pivot (23) can also be displaced radially by means of a screw (19) via a flexible tongue (20), in order to adjust the zero position of the feeler (24) resting on the diaphragm (2), or to carry out a zero-point correction.

<CLAIMS>
Measuring instrument comprising a mechanism for the
transmission of the position of a measuring member (2) to an

indicating member, the measuring device being supported in a
chassis, and the chassis being composed of shaped structural

parts (9, 12) which are at least partially connected by
elastic forces, characterised in that elastic holders (5)

are formed on a base (1) or a housing of the measuring
instrument which join the shaped parts (9, 12) by elastic

pressure and at the same time connect them to the base (1)
or the housing.
Instrument according to claim 1, characterised in that
two frame portions (9, 12) are provided of which the first

one (9) has a U-shaped configuration and the second one is
disposed between the shanks (11, 11a) of the other one while

a part (23) of the mechanism is mounted between the freely
protruding shanks of the first frame portion (9).
Instrument according to claim 2, characterised in that
the two frame portions (9, 12) are held between an inclined

flank (7) and a shoulder (8) of the holders (5) by elastic
force and positioned by interlocking positioning means (ll,

13, 14).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the base (1) comprises elastic

portions (44) which connect mounting points of the base to
the rest of the same and allow to prevent tensions in the

mounted base.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that at least one element (23) of the

mechanism is supported in at least one elastically 
deformable portion (25), which allows to obtain a play-free

support with a defined friction and/or a regulating capacity
of the element (23) for adjusting purposes.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 or 5,
characterised in that the measuring member is in the form of

a membrane (2) of a pressure pickup, and that the base (1)
of the measuring instrument is a bottom of the pressure

pickup which carries the membrane and which is deformed in
such a manner that its center is at a greater distance from

the membrane than its edge.
Instrument according to claim 6, characterised in that
the bottom (1) is integral with elastic holders (5) for the

chassis (9, 12) receiving the mechanism.
Instrument according to claim 5, characterised in that
the element is a rotatable transmission shaft (23) whose

rotation is transmitted by a radial pin (40), one of the
shaft ends being journalled in an axially elastic portion

(25) while the other shaft end runs on an axially
displaceable portion such as a screw, said portion in turn

being supported in a supporting member (20, 21) which is
elastically deformable and adjustable in the radial

direction.
Instrument according to claim 8, characterised in that
an adjusting screw acting upon the supporting member (20,

21) simultaneously serves to join frame portions (9, 12).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that bearings (25, 31) of an elastic flat

material are provided which comprise deformable retaining
forks formed by slots (28) and by means of which they are

held on projections (26). 
Method for the assembly of the instrument according to
claim 1, characterised in that at least a part of the

mechanism is pre-assembled by loosely joining transmission
elements (33 - 36) and frame portions (9, 12), and in that

it is subsequently held together and connected to the
remaining instrument parts (1) by a snap-in attachment to

holders (5) .
Method according to claim 11, characterised in that
the frame portions (9, 12) are connected by means of a

single screw (19), and in that an adjustment is obtained by
adjusting this screw (19) resp. by the deformation of one of

the frame parts according to the force of the screw.
