<ABSTRACT>
A refuse compactor device in a refuse collection vehicle, this 
latter comprising a body (2) in which refuse is deposited after 

its collection, a first movable compactor member (7) comprising a 
second member (16) movable relative to the first (7), and actuator 

means (8) for moving said first member (7) which are associated 
with the vehicle body (2) and act via hinges (14) on one end (30) 

of said member (7), said device comprising means (22) for guiding 
the movement of said end (30) relative to the vehicle body (2) and 

connection means (32) for indirectly connecting said first member 
(7) to said body (2), said connection means (32) being hinged at a 

first end (at 35) to the vehicle body (2) and at the second end to 
a region (31) of said first member (7) distant from that end (30) 

of this latter which is connected to the actuator means (8) for 
moving it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device in accordance with the 
introduction to the main claim. In a refuse collection vehicle, the first compacting member (or 
first compacting blade) is known to be hinged to one or more 
actuators, for example hydraulic, which themselves are hinged 
upperly to the vehicle body. Each hydraulic actuator can rotate about its retaining hinge until 
its longitudinal axis is in a position inclined to the top of the 
vehicle body such as to enable the blade to be raised to expose in 
the vehicle body a usual aperture through which the refuse is 
loaded into the body, for expulsion therefrom by the movement of a 
known expulsion plate which expels the refuse. The blade is also 
hinged directly to the vehicle body in a region distant from that 
end hinged to the hydraulic actuator. The hydraulic actuator, the first compacting member and the second 
member associated with this latter and movable with it define a 
known refuse compactor device within the vehicle body. Although 
this device is simple, it has various drawbacks, one of primary 
importance being the fact that the force exerted by the blades or 
compacting members on the refuse after its collection within the 
vehicle body is considerably limited by the direct connection of 
the first compacting blade to the vehicle body. Because of this 
connection the action of each actuator, which generates the 
movement of the first compacting blade (and consequently that of 
the second blade connected to the first) and which results in  
 
compaction of the refuse within the vehicle body is of low 
efficiency (compared with the power generated by the actuator), 
the compaction being penalized by the limited arm of the force 
generated by each actuator on the blade. In this respect, this 
arm, measured as the distance between the centre of rotation of 
each blade-actuator system (corresponding to the point at which 
the blade is connected to the vehicle body) and the line of action 
of the force generated by the actuator, is reduced during the 
final travel of the movable part (piston) of the actuator. There 
is a consequent reduction in the thrust which the blade exerts on 
and transmits to the refuse with the result that its compaction is 
only partial, as stated. The volume occupied by the refuse in the 
vehicle body is hence disproportionate to the actual refuse 
volume. In addition, the connection (by hinge) of each actuator to the 
vehicle body can result in problems related to possible knocking 
of the actuator against the

A refuse compactor device in a refuse collection vehicle, 
this latter comprising a body in which refuse is deposited after 

its collection, a first movable compactor member comprising 
preferably a second member movable relative to the first, and 

actuator means for moving said first member which are associated 
with the vehicle body and act via hinges on one end of said 

member, said device being characterised by comprising means (22) 
for guiding the movement of said end (30) relative to the vehicle 

body (2) and connection means (32) for indirectly connecting said 
first member (7) to said body (2), said connection means (32) 

being hinged at a first end (at 35) to the vehicle body (2) and at 
the second end to a region (31) of said first member (7) distant 

from that end (30) of this latter which is connected to the 
actuator means (8) for moving it. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
guide means are at least one guide (22) provided on the roof (6) 

of the vehicle body (2), with said guide there cooperating at 
least one slidable element (21) operationally associated with the 

end (30) of the first compactor member (7), this end moving 
parallel to the vehicle body (2). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the 
slidable element (21) is fixed onto at least one connection 

element (19) having its axis (X) at an angle to the longitudinal 
axis (Y) of the vehicle body (2) and connecting at least part of 

the actuator means for moving the first compactor member (7). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the 
guide means are two guides (22) positioned in proximity to the 

vehicle body sides (25, 26) and having their axes (Z) parallel to 
the longitudinal axis (Y) of this latter, in said guides there
