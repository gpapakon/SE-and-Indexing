<ABSTRACT>
A magnet assembly has a generally U-shape, the bight (3) of the U including a permanent magnet (4) which generates a magnetic field whose flux passes through a working volume defined between the arms (1, 2) of the U. The dimensions of the assembly are chosen such that Lg/Lm=Br/2Bg(1) where Lg is the length of the gap between the arms, Lm is the length of the magnet, Br is the remnant field of the magnet, and Bg is the field in the gap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to magnet assemblies 
particularly for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conventional MRI systems are large superconducting 
systems and generally have to be carefully mounted in 
special areas. Although this is acceptable for the 
purposes of laboratory applications such as spectroscopy 
and human body imaging, it is not so useful for recently 
developed applications of MRI. We have realised that a step towards solving this 
problem would be achieved by providing a magnet assembly 
based on permanent magnets rather than the usual 
superconducting magnets which require associated cryostats 
and the like to achieve a superconducting condition. 
Permanent magnet structures for magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) have been previously described. The most compact and 
economical in materials usage are those described by E. 
Potenziani and H.A. Leupold (IEEE Transactions on 
Magnetics Mag-22, 1078-1080, 1986). These make use of 
"cladding magnets" to oppose the magnetomotive force (mmf) 
around the outside of the structure. This has the effect 
of preventing flux leakage so as to most effectively use 
the permanent magnet material and obtain good field 
uniformity in the working volume. A disadvantage of this type of structure is that the 
working volume is substantially enclosed. This means that 
the magnet must be large enough to accommodate all the 
object to be examined, and that there are difficulties when 
the subject is large. Also when it is required to examine 
a relatively small volume of a large object, this type of 
"whole-body" magnet may not be the most economical. US-4 985 678 discloses a U-shaped assembly with a permanent magnet in the bight, but the working volume is defined between pole pieces at the end of the arms rather than between the arms themselves. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, a magnet assembly has a generally U-shape, 
wherein the bight of the U includes a permanent magnet 
which generates a magnetic field whose flux passes through 
a working volume defined between the arms of the U, and  
 
wherein the dimensions of the assembly are chosen such 
that:- 
LgLm=Br2Bg 
where: 
Lg is the length of the gap between the arms, arms, Lm is the length of the magnet, Br is the remnant field of the magnet, and Bg is the field in the gap. Magnets made in accordance with the first aspect of 
the invention have an open side enabling parts of a body to 
be positioned within the working volume so enabling bodies 
which are much larger than the
