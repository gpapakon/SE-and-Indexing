<ABSTRACT>
A cooling fixture for thermal spraying includes a rotatable 
tubular member (20) for supporting a tubular substrate (10) such as for 

an oxygen sensor. A cooling tube (44) extends from the tubular member 
into an open end of the substrate so as to delimit an annular 

channel (48) therein. The other end of the substrate is closed. Air 
is forced through the cooling tube into the substrate and thence 

out via the annular channel, to cool the substrate during thermal 
spray coating of the outside surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal spraying, to cooling a
substrate for thermal spraying, particularly to cooling a tubular
ceramic substrate, and most particularly for producing an oxygen
sensor.Thermal spraying, also known as flame spraying, involves the
melting or at least heat softening of a heat fusible material
such as a metal or ceramic, and propelling the softened material
in particulate form against a surface which is to be coated. The
heated particles strike the surface where they are quenched and
bonded thereto. In a plasma type of thermal spray gun, a plasma
stream is used to melt and propel powder particles. A high
intensity arc within the gun heats and accelerates an inert gas
such as argon or nitrogen to effect a plasma stream. An example
of such a gun is described in US-A-4 445 021. As
shown in the patent, plasma guns typically are cooled by water
channelling that direct the water over the electrode surfaces.
Other types of thermal spray guns include a combustion spray gun
in which powder is entrained and heated in a combustion flame,
either at moderate velocity or high velocity (supersonic). In a
wire type of gun a wire is fed through a combustion flame where a
melted wire tip is atomized by compressed air into a fine spray
for deposit. A two-wire arc gun melts contacting wire tips with
an electrical arc for atomization by compressed air.Although an aspect of thermal spraying is heating of the
workpiece by the hot flame or plasma issuing from the gun and by
the heated material depositing on the workpiece, the workpiece 
generally is maintained at relatively low temperature. The gun
is traversed repetitively across the substrate being coated so as
to distribute the coating particles and prevent local hot spots.
Additionally, a jet or flow of coolant is impinged on the
workpiece, away from the spray spot, to maintain temperature
within several hundred degrees of room temperature. Cooling of
the backside of a flat workpiece with air and water are disclosed
respectively in US-A-3 631 835 and US-A-4 297 388.
Excessive or uneven heating can result in oxidation of a metal
substrate or cracking of a ceramic substrate.Moreover, effective impingement of coolant onto a small workpiece
can interfere with the spray stream and deposits. Cooling air
must be very clean so as not to contaminate the coating. Also,
spot cooling of cylindrical substrates is not very uniform,
leading to stress. An example of a small cylindrical part to be
coated is an oxygen sensor for pollution control in automotive
engines,

A fixture for cooling a tubular ceramic substrate (10)
during thermal spray coating thereof, the substrate

having an inside surface (50), an outside surface (18),
an open end (11) and a closed end (13), the fixture

comprising:

support means (30) for supporting the substrate at one
end thereof; and
a cooling tube (44) mounted to extend coaxially through
the open end into the substrate so as to delimit an

annular channel (48) between the inside surface and the

a passage therein with a cross sectional area about

equal to a cross sectional area for the annular channel
