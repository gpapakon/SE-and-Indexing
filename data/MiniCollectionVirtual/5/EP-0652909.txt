<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a curable polysulfide composition, which has an application in making a preserving coating, and an insulator in the field of road construction, house building, etc. The target of the invention is to obtain a stable polysulfide curable composition for which the cure rate and the cure velocity are independant of the surroundings, to allow the obtaining of vulcanized material with high grade of technical and ecological parameters, avoiding the typical unpleasant smell of mercaptane polysulfides and the toxicity of the curing agents, additives and fillers. The problem is solved using the following curable polysulfide composition: polysulfide polymer and/or copolymer containing up to 1 mol/kg SH groups, with molecular weight from 2,000 to 200,000, polysulfide degree from 2.2 to 4.0, ramification rate up to 4 mol percent and degree of polymerization of 20 to 500 in an amount of 90 to 110 pbw and having the average formula (I); modifier up to 75 pbw; curing agent from 0.2 up to 20 pbw; polar solvent or reagent up to 25 pbw; acceptor from 5 to 50 pbw; fillers and other additives up to 150 pbw.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CURABLE POLYSULFIDE POLYMER COMPOSITIONThe invention relates to a curable polysulfide composition suitable for use as an insulator and filler (gap compensator) in road and house building and a means of binding various details in automobile and airplane construction, hermetical sealing, impreg¬ nating porous materials and preparing corrosion, hydro and thermo resistant coatings and caulkings.A composition is known that is self-curing under atmospheric conditions after application on a surface. This mixture comprises a liquid polysulfide mercaptan group-terminated polymer (molecular weight 4000, cross-linking 0.5%, mercaptan groups 0.53 mol/kg), a peroxide of an alkaline or alkaline earth metal as a watersoluble curing agent, an alkaline or alkaline earth oxide, hydroxide or salt of a weak acid as a water-soluble activating agent as well as other modifying additives and fillers I I.Drawbacks of the composition: the curing agents are highly inflammable and unstable peroxide compounds; the curing rate is unpredictable since it depends directly on the moisture present in the air; the presence of mercaptan groups in the polymer imparts an unpleasant smell to the composition and may provoke cyclic polycondensation or preliminary curing during the storage.A curable composition is known to those skilled in the art as well as a method of curing this composition 121 , which consists in mixing at ambiant temperature of: (a) polysul fide polymeric latex zw-679 (10-20 pbw) which represents an aqueous dispersion contain- 

ing about 60% of a solid phase linear polymer, with a molecularweight of 100 000 and the general formula.-/R - Sχ/n-, wherein S is a polysulfide linkage, R is oxahydrocarbon, n is about 500; (b) a polyurethane prepolymer (15-30% of the total amount of the mixture and 4-10% isocyanate groups); (c) fillers; (d) plasticizers; (e) a latex stabilizer and (f) an antisponging agent.A disadvantage of this composition is that no real curing (cross-linking) of the polysulfide polymer occurs because the composition contains neither branches along the linear chain nor mercaptan groups by means of which curing or cocuring with the polyurethane copolymer would occur. Besides, the composition con¬ tains no curing agent, in fact the mixture harden as a result of hydrolysis of the isocyanate groups of the polyurethane under the effect of the water of the latex dispersion, while the polysulfide polymer densifies by coalescence without cross-linking and, as a result, a series of the properties of the cured product
