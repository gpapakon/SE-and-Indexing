<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the Ikaros gene and to the differentiation and
generation of T cells.The generation of the T cell repertoire from a progenitor stem cell proceeds
through a differentiation pathway in which the later intrathymic steps are well
documented while the early extrathymic events are only poorly characterized. One of
the earliest definitive T cell differentiation markers is the CD3δ gene of the CD3/TCR
complex.Science, vol 258, 30 october 1992, pages 808-812 reports on Ikaros, an Early lymphoid-Specific
Transcription Factor and a Portative Mediator for T Cell Commitment.The Ikaros gene, a gene active in the early differentiation of T cells, has been
discovered. The gene encodes a family of unique zinc finger proteins, the Ikaros
proteins. The proteins of the Ikaros family are isoforms which arise from differential
splicing of Ikaros gene transcripts. The isoforms of the Ikaros family generally
include a common 3' exon (Ikaros exon E7, which includes amino acid residues 203-431
of mouse Ikaros) but differ in the 5' region. The Ikaros family includes all
splicing variants which arise from transcription and processing of the Ikaros gene.
Five isoforms are described herein. Ikaros proteins can bind and activate the enhancer
of the CD3δ gene and are restricted primarily if not solely to T cells in the adult. The
expression pattern of this transcription factor during embryonic development suggests
that Ikaros proteins play a role as a genetic switch regulating entry into the T cell
lineage. The Ikaros gene is also expressed in the proximal corpus striatum during
early embryogenesis in mice.In general, the invention features, a DNA, preferably a purified DNA, including
(or consisting of) a sequence which encodes a peptide including (or
consisting of) one or more Ikaros exons of figure 4 (SEQ 10 NO:5) and which has an Ikaros activity. In preferred embodiments the
Ikaros exon is any of E1/2, E3, E4, E5, E6, or E7; the purified DNA does not encode
exon E7.In other preferred embodiments: the encoded peptide further includes a second
Ikaros exon; the second exon is any of E1/2, E3, E4, E5, E6, or E7; the first exon is E7
and the second exon is any of E1/2, E3, E4, E5, E6. In other preferred embodiments: the encoded peptide further includes a third
Ikaros exon; the third exon is any of E1/2, E3, E4, E5, E6, or E7; the first exon is E7,
said second exon is E3, and the third exon is E1/2; the peptide is Ikaros isoform 5.In other preferred embodiments: the encoded peptide further includes a fourth
Ikaros
