<ABSTRACT>
An ice cream making machine comprising a freezing 
cylinder (11); a shaft (1) co-axial with said freezing cylinder 

(11); means to rotate said shaft; two pairs of arms (2, 3) 
keyed to the end portions of said shaft (1), scraping blades (4) 

extending over the entire length of said cylinder 11 and 
supported by said arms (2, 3) in scraping relation with the 

walls of said freezing cylinder (11), and sliding blocks (8) at 
the two ends of said blades (4). Said blades (4) are provided 

at the ends thereof with a side projection (5) formed with a 
through hole (6), said projection (5) being received in a 

recess (9) formed in a side face of each of said sliding blocks 
(8) said sliding blocks (8) being formed with a blind hole (10) 

intersecting said recess (9), said arms (2, 3) being provided at 
an end with a stem (7), designed to be introduced into the 

blind hole (10) of said sliding blocks (8) and through the hole 
(6) in said projection (5) of the blades (4), so as to 

inter-engage said blades (4) and sliding blocks (8) with said 
arms (2, 3).

Scraping and stirring device for ice cream making machines
 This invention relates to a scraping and stirring device for ice cream making machines. More particularly, this invention relates to a device for securing the scarping blades to the spokes or arms of the stirrer in a simple and reliable manner.


 According to one feature of the invention, in an ice cream machine of the type comprising a freezing cylinder, a shaft coaxial with said freezing cylinder, means to rotate said shaft, at least two pairs of radial arms keyed to the end portions of said shaft, scraping blades extending over the entire lenght of said cylinder and supported by said arms in scraping relation with the walls of said freezing cylinder, and sliding blocks at the two ends of said blades;
 the improvement is provided according to which the said blades are provided at the ends thereof with a side projection   formed    with a   through    hole, said projections being received in a recess formed in a side  face of each of the said sliding blocks, said sliding blocks being formed with a blind hole intersecting said recess, said arms being provided at an end with a stem designated to be introduced into the blind hole of said sliding blocks and through the hole in said projection of the blades, so as to inter-engage said blades and sliding blocks with said arms.


 According to a further feature of the invention, means are provided to be inserted between said arms and said sliding blocks to compensate for the wear of said blades.


 Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, made with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein:
 Figure 1 is a fragmentary elevational and partly sectional view of the end of a spoke of a stirrer having secured thereto the scarper blade and guide sliding block, and
 Figure 2 is a diagrammatical front view of the stirrer according to the invention.


 With reference to the drawing, the numeral 1 indicates the shaft of the stirrer. Keyed to both ends of the shaft 1  are the spokes or radial arms 2, 3 supporting the scraping blades 4. Each blade 4 is provided, at the end thereof, with a side projection 5 formed with a through hole 6 engaged on a stem 7 which is formed as a continuation of the end of each arm 2,3. The numeral 8 indicates the sliding blocks of self-lubricating material, formed with a side recess 9 for receiving said projection 5 and with a blind hole 10 which, when said projection 5 is in the
