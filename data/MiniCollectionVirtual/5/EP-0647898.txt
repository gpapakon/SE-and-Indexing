<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for activating a dual-mode logic 
device (16, 28) is provided. The apparatus monitors a 

parameter of an input signal of the logic device (16, 
28). If the parameter falls outside of predetermined 

parametric ranges, the apparatus activates the logic 
device (16, 28). In the preferred embodiment, the 

apparatus resides on the same semiconductor chip as the 
logic device (16, 28), and monitors the voltage level 

of the input signal. If the voltage level falls 
outside the voltage range which represents a logical 

HIGH and the voltage range which represents a logical 
LOW, the apparatus activates the logic device (16, 28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
comprising a logic device and an activator circuit
for activating a logic device when the logic device is required to
perform an operation, preferably to an
apparatus comprising a logic device and an activator circuit for detecting when a parameter of a signal
sent to a logic device falls outside predefined
parametric ranges.It has become increasingly important to
provide computer components which consume less energy.
consequently, many logic devices (e.g. PALs and EPROMs)
have been developed which may be "powered-down" when
they are not being used to perform computational
operations. Specifically, logic devices have been
developed which assume either an idle mode or an active
mode responsive to an activation signal. Such logic
devices are referred to herein as dual-mode logic
devices. In the idle mode, dual-mode logic devices
consume little or no power, but are incapable of
performing operations. In the active mode, logic
devices consume more power and can perform operations.In order to operate efficiently, dual-mode
logic devices must be able to sense when they are
required to perform an operation, assume the active
mode, and perform the required operation, without
imposing any timing delays for the activation process.One approach to dual-mode logic device design
is to provide an additional I/O pin on the
semiconductor on which the dual-mode logic device
resides for receiving the "wake-up" or activation
signal. This external activation approach has the
disadvantage that it requires additional external pins
and communication lines. The approach has the further
disadvantage that additional circuitry must be added to
the components which call the dual-mode logic device to 
enable such components to send the activation signal
required to activate the dual-mode logic device.Another known approach is to provide edge-detecting
activation circuitry which detects when the dual-mode logic
device is receiving information which it must process by
sensing the occurrence of an edge on an input line to the
logic device. When an edge is detected on an input line to
the logic device, edge-detecting activation circuitry
causes the dual-mode logic device to assume the active
mode.The edge-detection approach avoids the need for
external activation lines, but requires the use of
relatively complex edge-detection circuitry. The resulting
increase in circuit complexity often requires a larger die
size to be used in the chip manufacturing process, making
the manufacture of chips
