<ABSTRACT>
Lock detecting terminals are disposed on one of connector 
housings that are engageable with each other, and a short 

circuit terminal is disposed on the other connector housing, 
the short circuit terminal serving to short-circuit the lock 

detecting terminals upon engagement of both housings. The lock 
detecting terminals are arranged so as to extend along an inner 

wall surface of the housing in such a manner that the distal 
ends thereof are not contact with the edge portion of the 

engagement opening of the housing. As a result of this 
construction, the lock detecting terminals will no longer be 

deformed while caught by the edge portion of the housing even 
when the housing is being engaged with the housing misaligned. 

Furthermore, the one connector has the short circuit electrode 
exposed to the outside and has a cover movable between a 

protecting position and an opening position, the protecting 
position being such a position as to allow the cover to cove
r 
the short circuit electrode, the opening position being such a 

position as to allow the cover to expose the short circuit 
electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock detecting connector
which can detect that a pair of connectors engageable
with each other are in a completely locked state.Recently, automobiles carry air bags. Safety devices
such as these air bags must be highly reliable, which thus
demands that incomplete connection of male and female connectors
be avoided with certainty. To meet such demand,
connectors whose complete connection is detected electrically
have been developed to date.Fig. 1 shows a conventionally known lock detecting
structure of this type. A groove-like engagement portion la
is formed on the upper surface of a connector 1 on the male
side that is firmly fixed on a board 2. On the other hand,
a flexible lock piece having a projection 7a is integrally
formed on the upper surface of a connector 5 on the female
side to be engaged with the connector 1 on the male side,
the projection 7a being held by the engagement portion la
when both connectors 1, 5 are connected.In addition, within the connector 1 on the male side, a
pair of lock detecting electrodes 4a, 4b is disposed while
positioned on both sides of an inverted T-shaped position
determining piece 3 as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand,
within the connector 5 on the female side, a U-shaped short
circuit electrode 6 is arranged so as to interpose the position
determining piece 3 between the leg portions thereof
as shown in Fig. 2.In the thus designed lock detecting structure, as the
connector 5 on the female side is being inserted into the
connector 1 on the male side while elastically deforming a
flexible lock piece 7 thereof, the short circuit electrode
6 is elastically deformed upward by a guide projection 3b
formed on a partition wall 3a of the position determining
piece 3 as shown in Fig. 3, so that the short circuit electrode 
6 keeps distance from the detecting electrodes 4a, 4b
at the initial stage of the insertion. Then, when the connector
5 on the female side has been inserted into a regular
position of the connector 1 on the male side, the projection
7a of the flexible lock piece 7 is held by the engagement
portion la to thereby unremovably lock both connectors
1, 5. At the same time, the short circuit electrode
6 comes out of the projection 3b to come in contact with
the lock detecting electrodes 4a, 4b as shown in Fig. 4.
The lock detecting electrodes 4a, 4b are connected to a not
shown detecting circuit, so that it is judged that both
connectors 1, 5 have been connected in the locked state by
way of short-circuiting the lock

A lock detecting connector comprising:

two connector housings (310, 330) for engagement with
each other, wherein at least a pair of lock detecting terminals

(333) being provided in one (330) of the connector
housings; and
a short circuit terminal (316) in the other (310) of
the connector housings, the short circuit terminal (316)

serving to detect a locked state of both connector housings
(310, 330) by way of short-circuiting the pair of lock detecting

terminals (333) when both connector housings are
engaged with each other completely,

   characterized in that

said other connector housing (310) has the short circuit
terminal (316) exposed to the outside and has a cover

(320) movable between a protecting position and an opening
position, the protecting position being such a position as

to allow the cover (320) to cover a contact portion (316a)
of the short circuit terminal (316), the opening position

being such a position as to allow the cover (320) to expose
said contact portion (316a) of the short circuit terminal

(316), and
the cover (320) is pushingly moved from the protecting
position to the opening position by said one connector

housing (330) when both connector housings (310, 330) are
being connected.
The lock detecting connector of claim 1, wherein
the lock detecting terminals (333) are arranged along an

inner wall surface of the one connector housing (330) accommodating
the lock detecting terminals, and distal ends

(333a) of the lock detecting terminals (333) are positioned
backward with respect to an engagement opening of the one

connector housing (330). 
The lock detecting connector as claimed in claim 1
or 2, wherein a flexible lock piece (312) is formed on said

one connector housing (330) and an engagement portion (335)
is formed on the other (310) of the connector housings, respectively;

and wherein said short circuit terminal (316)

said engagement portion (335).
The lock detecting connector of anyone of claims 1

wherein said short circuit terminal is elastically deformed
by said engagement portion (335) such that said lock detecting

terminals (333) are out of electrical contact with
said short circuit terminal (316) unless said engagement

portion (335) engages an engagement hole (317) in said one
(310) connector housing when both connector housings (310,

330) are completely connected and said short circuit terminal
(316) is elastically restored, so that electrical contact

between said short circuit terminal (316) and said
