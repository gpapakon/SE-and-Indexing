<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of derivatives of ketogluconic acid as 
photographic agents. Development of a photographic image (both negative and positive) is 
accomplished by selective reduction of light sensitized silver halide to elemental silver. 
Chemicals capable of this selective reduction are generally of the "Kendall Structure" 
X1-(C=C)n-X2 
wherein X1 and X2 are hydroxy, amino or substituted amino group and n is either zero 
or an integer. Silver halide emulsions are coated on various papers and films for use in 
photographic applications. When these emulsions have been exposed to radiation, the 
sensitized emulsion produces a latent image in the silver halide grains. The image is 
latent because the grains are sensitized to reduction by the formation of minute 
quantities of free silver in the grains from the exposure. These grains are developed 
by placing the exposed photosensitive material in an aqueous solution containing one 
or more specific reducing chemicals. There are very few reducing agents which will 
only develop the latent image and not reduce the unexposed silver halide. The 
reducing agents conventionally employed include such organic materials as 
hydroquinone and other materials meeting the criteria of the Kendall-Pelz rule. The structure of developing agents according to the rule are as follows: 
a-(A=B)-a' 
where 
A is carbon, B is carbon or nitrogen, a and a' are OH, NH2, NHR1, NR1R2.  
Examples of chemicals meeting this rule are hydroquinone, catechol, pyrogallol, 
ascorbic acid and its stereoisomers, and derivatives of phenylenediamine. An example 
of a developing agent which is an exception to the rule is 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone 
(Phenidone). Two of these developing agents may be used in the same formulation to 
produce a result known in the photographic industry as superadditivity, also known as 
synergy. It is defined as the mixture of two developing agents showing a greater 
degree of developer activity than the sum of the actions of each agent separately.  
 Figs. 1-6 are graphs showing the effect of various ketogluconates on 
photographic media. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a process for the 
development of a photographic image on a photographic medium comprising reducing 
the photosensitized silver on said medium with an effective amount of (a) a compound 
selected from the group consisting of alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, amine 
salts of ketogluconic acid, alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and
