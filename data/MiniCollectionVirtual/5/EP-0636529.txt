<ABSTRACT>
A flow control valve (1) for power-steering pumps is proposed, which valve has a control piston (7) which can move within a valve bore (5) and has two pressure-compensating surfaces (31, 33) which can be acted upon by different levels of pressure. The flow control valve is distinguished in that the pressure-compensating surfaces are of different sizes.

A flow regulating valve for power steering pumps, having a control piston which is 
movable within a valve bore and has at least two pressure governor surfaces able to be 

acted upon with different pressure levels, the first pressure governor surface (31) being 
able to be acted upon with the pressure generated by the power steering pump and the 

second pressure governor surface (33) being able to be acted upon by the pressure 
supplied to the steering gear and the first pressure governor surface (31) being smaller 

than the second pressure governor surface (33), characterised in that the pressure 
supplied to the steering gear can act upon the second pressure governor surface (33) via a 

pressure channel (17) passing through the control piston (7). 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the pressure 
channel (17) is provided with a pilot choke (25). 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised by a spring 
member in the form of a helical spring (29) which acts upon the control piston (7; 107) 

with a pressure acting in the same direction as the pressure acting on the second pressure 
governor surface (33). 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the control piston (7; 107) is part of a discharge choke (opening 21) 

influencing the control flow issued from the power steering pump to the steering gear. 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that in the at rest position, the control piston (7; 107) closes a fluid 

connection present between a first pressure chamber (15) acted upon with the discharge 
delivered by the pump and a region having a low pressure level. 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the fluid 
connection can be closed by a seat valve (39; 139). 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the fluid 
connection can be closed by a sliding valve.  

 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 7, characterized in that the outer 
surface of the control piston (7) has a first region (41, 143) with a first external diameter 

and a second region (45) with a second external diameter. 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 8, characterised in that the region 
(143) becomes the region (45) via an outwards-flaring annular surface (147). 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the valve bore (105) receiving the control piston (7) is in the form of 

a stepped bore whose internal diameters are matched to the external diameters of the 
control piston (7). 
A flow regulating valve in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the fluid 
connection can be sealed by means of a seat-sliding valve.
