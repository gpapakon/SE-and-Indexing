<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of hydrocarbyl chain-grafted 
cellulose fibres by contacting cellulose fibres wherein 

0.25 - 33.3 % of the hydroxyl groups have been converted 
into the corresponding alkali metal oxy groups at 20 - 150 

°C with an organic compound comprising a hydrocarbyl 
chain having a molecular weight of at least 150 and which 

chain carries an electrophylic functional group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of hydrocarbyl chain-grafted cellulose fibres, 
to the hydrocarbyl chain-grafted cellulose fibres made by 
said process and to their use. The preparation of polymer-grafted cellulose including 
certain classes of polymer-grafted cellulose fibres or 
fibrous materials, has been described in US-A-3,492,082. 
Said polymer-grafted cellulose products are 
prepared by converting hydroxyl groups of cellulose into 
hydroperoxide groups via the formation of an intermediate 
sulfonate ester group. Subsequently the hydroperoxide 
group-containing cellulose is reacted with a reactive 
monomer to yield a polymer-grafted cellulose material. Said 
method for the preparation of polymer-grafted cellulose 
materials has the inherent disadvantage in that the chain 
length of the polymer grafts may vary quite considerably, 
while simultaneously there is always the chance of non-grafted 
polymer species being formed, e.g. as a result of chain 
transfer reactions. A further disadvantage is that the types 
of polymer grafts are restricted to compositions based on 
monomers which have the ability to polymerize in the presence 
of a hydroperoxide type of free-radical initiator. The 
preparation of polymer-grafted cellulose materials thus 
leaves room for improvement.
 
Therefore the problem underlying the present invention is 
the improvement of the preparation of such grafted cellulose 
materials.
 
To solve this problem the applicant now proposes to graft a 
ready made hydrocarbyl chain of relatively high molecular 
weight, carrying a functional group, onto a fibrous cellulose 
derivative, while maintaining the fibre structure of the 
cellulose material.  The invention provides therefore a process for the 
preparation of hydrocarbyl chain-grafted cellulose fibres, 
which process comprises contacting cellulose fibres wherein, 
in the range of from 0.25 to 33.3 % of the hydroxyl groups 
have been converted into the corresponding alkali metal oxy 
groups, with an organic compound comprising a hydrocarbyl 
chain having a molecular weight of at least 150 and which 
chain carries an electrophylic functional group, at a 
temperature in the range of from 20 C° to 150 °C. The reaction of alkali metal cellulosates, prepared by 
treating cellulosic materials with sodium in the presence of 
liquid ammonia, with esterifying agents such as C₂-C₄ 
acyl halides, is known from US-A-2,181,906. 
From said disclosure, wherein only the reaction with acetyl 
chloride is exemplified,
