<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for ring 
opening polymerization by the use of an enzyme catalyst, and 
it also relates to this enzyme catalyst for the ring opening 
polymerization. The method for the ring opening polymerization is a 
polymerization technique in which the polymerization proceeds 
with the ring opening of a cyclic compound as a monomer to 
synthesize a polymer. At present, industrially important 
various synthetic polymers such as nylons, polyesters, 
polyethers, polyethyleneimines and polysiloxanes have been 
manufactured by the ring opening polymerization methods. In 
general, in order to cause the ring opening polymerization to 
proceed, it is necessary to add a catalyst to a reaction 
system. This catalyst acts on the cyclic compound to 
accelerate a ring opening reaction. For cationic reactive monomers such as cyclic ethers, 
cyclic formals and cyclic imines, examples of the usable 
catalyst include Lewis acids such as BF₃·O(C₂H₅)₂, SnCl₄ and  
 
AlCl₃; alkyl halides such as alkyl chlorides and alkyl 
bromides; superstrong acids such as CF₃SO₃H; superstrong acid 
esters such as CF₃SO₃R (R is an alkyl group); and cationic 
salts such as R₃C⁺PF6⁻ and R₃O⁺BF₄⁻ (R is an alkyl group). 
Furthermore, for anionic reactive monomers such as cyclic 
siloxanes, lactams and cyclic acid anhydrides, examples of 
the usable catalyst include Li, Na, K, RCOONa, RONa and R₂NLi 
(R is an alkyl group). In addition, for coordinated anionic 
reactive monomers such as cyclic ethers and lactones, 
examples of the usable catalyst include (C₂H₅)₂Zn-H₂O, 
(C₂H₅)₂Zn-ROH, AlR₃-acetylacetone-H₂O (R is an alkyl group), 
and for metathetical reactive monomers such as cyclic 
olefins, examples of the usable catalyst include MoCl₅ and 
WCl₆. However, these conventional catalysts have some 
problems. For example, (1) the effect of the catalyst is 
insufficient; (2) side reactions other than the 
polymerization take place; and (3) a part of the used 
catalyst is incorporated into a produced polymer, and in this 
case, the electrical insulating properties and the 
performance of the polymer deteriorate. Moreover, in the ring opening polymerization by the use 
of the conventional catalyst, the main chain and the terminal 
structure of the polymer cannot be sufficiently controlled,  
 
and for this reason, such a conventional catalyst is 
unsuitable for a method for the preparation of a functional 
polymer. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a method for ring opening polymerization
