<ABSTRACT>
A coin delivering apparatus 1 includes a coin escalator 3 having a coin passage 13 
where coins 2 advance in a row. A gate 17 is provided at a side wall of the coin passage 

for opening and closing a portion of the side wall. A coin delivering unit 5 is further 
provided to deliver the coins toward an inlet 15 of the coin passage in sequence. When 

the gate is closed, the coins delivered by the coin delivering unit advance into the coin 
passage via the inlet thereof and are forced out from an outlet 11 of the coin passage. 

When the gate is opened while no coins are delivered by the coin delivering unit 5, the 
coins remaining in the coin passage are transferred by the coin delivering unit to a coin 

collecting opening 9 to be discharged therethrough. On the other hand, when the gate is 
opened while the coins are delivered by the coin delivering unit, the coins delivered by 

the coin delivering unit are first transferred to the coin collecting opening to be 
discharged therethrough on a preferential basis prior to the coins remaining in the coin 

passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin delivering apparatus
for delivering coins, medals, tokens or the like (hereinafter
generally referred to as "coins"), for use in a money exchanger, a
dispenser, a game machine or the like. More specifically, the
present invention relates to a coin delivering apparatus which is
capable of collecting coins remaining in the coin delivering
apparatus, particularly, in a hopper or an escalator incorporated in
the coin delivering apparatus.Conventional coin delivering apparatuses of this type will be
explained. Figs. 3 and 4 are diagrams showing a coin delivering
apparatus disclosed in Japanese First (unexamined) Patent
Publication No. 61-281385 (see also US-A-4 752 274). This coin delivering apparatus includes
a hopper 101 defining a space for accommodating a plurality of
coins, a cylindrical case 103 provided at a lower end of the hopper
101, an outlet hole 110 opened at a lower end portion of a
circumferential wall of the cylindrical case 103 at an upper side
thereof, and an inclined base plate 102 forming a bottom of the
cylindrical case 103. The coin delivering apparatus further includes
a coin delivering disk 104 disposed on the base plate 102 and
rotated by rotation of a motor shaft 107 of an electric motor 105 via
a reduction gear unit 106, five coin guide holes 108 penetrating the 
coin delivering disk 104 for causing coins A to fall therethrough
onto the base plate 102 and to be guided, and a coin delivering arm
109 which is provided between the base plate 102 and the coin
delivering disk 104 so as to extend radially up to a circle defined by
connecting substantially the centers of the coin guide holes 108.
The coin delivering arm 109 is rotated due to rotation of the coin
delivering disk 104 to slide the coin, which has fallen through the
coin guide hole 108 onto the base plate 102, along a given rotational
orbit on the base plate 102 so as to transfer it toward the outlet hole
110. The coin delivering apparatus further includes an outlet guide
pin 130 which is arranged to abut the coin transferred by the coin
delivering arm 109 so that the coin deviates from the rotational
orbit and is guided to a side of the outlet hole 110. The coin
delivering apparatus further includes an outlet guide member 111
arranged between the base plate 102 and the coin delivering disk
104 and at a downstream side of the outlet hole 110 for guiding the
coin A, which has deviated from the rotational orbit due to the
outlet guide pin 130, to the outlet hole 110.A scraper (coin

<CLAIMS>
A coin delivering apparatus (1) comprising:

a coin escalator (3) having therein a coin passage (13) along which coins arranged
in a row can pass, said coin passage having an inlet (15) and an outlet (11) which is

arranged at a position higher than said inlet;
coin delivering means (5) for delivering a coin to the inlet (15) of said coin
passage (13) to push upwards the coin row in said coin passage so as to force out the

foremost coin via the outlet (11) of the coin passage;
a movable gate (17) provided at a side wall of said coin passage (13); and a coin
collecting opening (9) provided outside said gate;

   characterised in that:

with said gate (17) in a first position, said coin delivery means (5) is adapted to
deliver a coin to said inlet (15) of said coin passage (13); and
with said gate (17) in a second position, said coin delivery means (5) is adapted to
receive a coin from the inlet (15) of said coin passage (13) and to deliver said coin to said

coin collecting opening (9) via said gate (17).
A coin delivery apparatus (1) according to Claim 1 further comprising coin
feeding means (7) for feeding coins to said coin delivering means (5).
A coin delivering apparatus (1) according to Claim 2 in which said coin
delivering means (5) is adapted to receive coins from said coin feeding means (7) and to
