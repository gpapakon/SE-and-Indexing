<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a cross-country vehicle (10) (off-road vehicle) having a driver's cab (13) and a cargo area (14), and having an apparatus (15) which is mounted on the cargo area (14) and overhangs the driver's cab (13), especially for anti-aircraft defence, the apparatus (15) is arranged on a platform (23) in order to ensure air-transportability and good driving characteristics for the vehicle despite the apparatus (15) being fitted on it, which platform (23) is held on a framework (24), which is firmly anchored to the cargo area (14), such that it can pivot about a pivoting axis (pivoting shaft) (25), which extends transversely with respect to the vehicle longitudinal axis, from an approximately horizontal in-use position located essentially parallel to the cargo area (14) underneath the roof contour (26) into an approximately vertical transportation position, extending along the rear wall of the driver's cab, and vice versa. The pivoting axis (25) is arranged such that, when the platform (23) is in the transportation position, the centre of gravity of the apparatus (15) is located in front of the vehicle rear axle (12) and as close to the cargo area (14) as possible.

<CLAIMS>
All-terrain vehicle with driver's cabin (13) and 
loading area (14) and with a device (15) mounted on 

the loading area (14) to project at least partially 
beyond the driver's cabin (13), said device sitting on 

a platform (23) connected to a frame (24) and being 
capable of being swung around a swivel axis (25) 

extending transversely to the longitudinal axis from a 
horizontal position for use, in which the platform 

(23) is oriented substantially parallel to the loading 
area (14) below the roof contour (26) of the driver's 

cabin (13), into a position for transport and vice 
versa, characterised in that the frame (24) is rigidly 

anchored on the loading area (14) and the swivel axis 
(25) is arranged between the platform (23) and the 

frame (24); and that the swivel axis (25) is arranged 
in such a manner that in the swung down position for 

transport, the platform (23) extends substantially 
vertically along the rear wall of the driver's cabin 

and the centre of gravity of the platform (23) and 
device (15) lies in front of the rear axle (12) of the 

vehicle in the direction of travel and at as short a 
distance from the loading area (14) as possible. 
Vehicle according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the surface of the platform (23) receiving the device 

(15), when in its position for use, lies at only a 
short distance below the roof contour edge (26) of the 

driver's cabin (13) of the vehicle (10). 
Vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the frame (24) has a U-shaped frame member (27) 

extending substantially parallel to the loading area  
 

(14) with the opening of the U shape averted from the 
driver's cabin (13), said frame member being fastened 

on the loading area (14) by means of support struts 
(27 to 31); and that in its position of use, the 

platform (23) abuts against the bottom side of the 
frame member (27) with the swivel axis (25) arranged 

close to the transverse web (271) of the frame member 
(27) or swings, preferably so as to be flush, into the 

frame member (27). 
Vehicle according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
two vertical struts (28) running approximately 

parallel to the rear wall of the driver's cabin and 
two oblique struts (29) inclined to the vertical abut 

the transverse web (271) of the U-shaped frame member 
(27) close to the free end of the legs (272, 273) of 

the U-shaped frame member (27), whereby the vertical 
struts (28) are supported on the loading area (14) 

close to the driver's cabin (13) and the oblique 
struts (29) are supported on the loading area (14) 

behind the rear axle (12) of the vehicle in the 
direction of travel. 
Vehicle according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
additional reinforcing struts (30) run from a base 

point of the vertical struts (28) to a respective leg 
(272, 273) of the U-shaped frame member (27) and 

further reinforcing struts (31) run from a respective 
base point of the oblique struts (29) respectively to 

one of the vertical struts (28). 
Vehicle according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the platform (23) is rotatably 

mounted via two bearing journals (33, 34) flush with  
 

the swivel axis (25) in the legs (272, 273) of the U-shaped 
frame member (27). 
Vehicle according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that the platform (23) may be locked 

in its position for use on the frame member (27). 
Vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in which 
the device (15) has at least one missile launcher tube 

(16), which may be swung horizontally and in 
elevation, characterised in that the device (15) sits 

on a turntable or slewing crown (21) parallel to the 
platform (23) and rotatable around a vertical 

rotational axis (20); that two bearing blocks (22) 
project at right angles from the slewing crown (21) in 

which the at least one missile launcher tube (16) is 
mounted to swivel; and that the swivel axis (19) of 

the at least one missile launcher tube (16) is 
arranged at a sufficient distance from the slewing 

crown (21) to allow the missile launching tube (16) to 
be oriented approximately parallel to the rotational 

axis (20) of the slewing crown (21).
