<ABSTRACT>
In the roller charging apparatus (201) the charging roller
is built with epichlorohydrin rubber (101), so that it

is possible to eliminate electric nonuniformity of a
conductive elastic layer and to be charged by loading

only a DC voltage. In addition durability can be
improved by setting the roller hardness of the charging

roller (101) to 42 (measured by a JISA hardness meter)
or more. The apparatus comprises a cleaner (203) for removing

foreign materials deposited on the surface of said charging roller, the
rubber hardness of said cleaner being harder than that of said roller.

The cleaner is made of urethane or ethylene propylene. A lubricant
additive film layer is formed on the surface of said charging roller

(101) or lubricant is applied onto the surface of said charging roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller charging apparatus which loads a DC current to a charging roller contacting a drum-formed or a belt-formed photosensitive element and rotating in association with movement of the photosensitive element to homogeneously electrify the entire surface of the photosensitive element, a roller charging apparatus comprising at least a charging roller contacting a photosensitive drum and rotating in association with movement of the photosensitive element and a cleaning blade to remove foreign materials, such as toner, deposited on the surface of the charging roller, and an image forming apparatus using the same.As a charging apparatus for homogeneously charging the entire surface of a photosensitive element in an image forming apparatus based on an electrophotographic system, a corona discharger has been widely used. Although this corona discharger is effective as a means for homogeneously charging a photosensitive element to a certain level of voltage, a high voltage power supply unit is required in processing for electrification by means of corona discharge, and a large quantity of ozone is generated in association with the discharge. When a large quantity of ozone is generated, it gives bad effects over environment, and sometimes charging members and a photosensitive element are disadvantageously deteriorated by ozone.In contrast to the corona discharger as described above, a charging roller which electrifies a surface of a photosensitive drum 702 by causing a charging roller 701 to contact a photosensitive drum 702 and rotate in association with movement of the photosensitive drum to load a voltage from a power supply unit 704 to a core metal 703 of the charging roller 701 has been put into practical use as shown in Fig. 18. This charging roller 701 as a charging means makes it possible to use a low voltage power supply unit, and also a quantity of ozone generated in association with a processing for electrification is advantageously reduced. Also absorption of dust due to static electricity generated in association with use of a corona electrode wire does not occur, and advantageously a high voltage power supply unit is not required.However, with a charging roller, often unevenness in electrification may easily occur, and in addition a static voltage in an electrified area may largely and disadvantageously fluctuate due to changes in environmental conditions, and as far as the homogeneity in electrification is concerned, capability of the charging roller is
