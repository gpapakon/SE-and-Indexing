described in which a processing device (12, 14, 16, 

18) which is immersed in processing liquid in a 
processing chamber (52), the processing device 

defining a channel (20) through which a web is 
transported by transport rollers for contact with a 

treatment liquid. Liquid is injected into the channel 
(20) through one or more injection apertures (24) and 

evacuated from the channel (20) at one or more 
evacuation apertures (28). A pump (56) which is 

totally immersed in treatment liquid circulates the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processing apparatus 
for processing web material and is more particularly 
concerned with processing apparatus for processing 
light sensitive material such as photographic film or 
paper. Many conventional photographic processors 
comprise a plurality of tanks containing various 
processing fluids, each tank having a plurality of 
rollers for transporting the light sensitive material 
therethrough. A web of light sensitive material in 
continuous or sheet form is transported through the 
tanks in a generally sinusoidal path. The web is 
continuously contacted by the rollers leading to 
possible scratching of the light sensitive material. 
Typically, the rollers are driven so that the surface 
speed of the rollers match the speed of the light 
sensitive material. Any agitation of the fluid is the 
result of the relative motion between the fluid and 
light sensitive material. A variety of photographic processors have 
been proposed which attempt to reduce the contact 
between light sensitive material and drive rollers to 
thereby reduce the possibility of scratching or 
marring of the material being processed. The proposed 
processors aim for uniform distribution of the 
processing fluid directed on to the light sensitive 
material to obtain uniform development of the 
material. Such processors also aim for increased 
chemical transfer rates to and from the light 
sensitive material being processed. They also attempt 
to contain the processing fluids within their 
respective tanks to prevent contamination of the 
processing fluids.  Conventional film or paper processors 
generally use external pumps to circulate processing 
fluids within the processor tanks to ensure constant 
mixing of bulk solutions and in some cases to provide 
agitation of the solutions near the surface of the 
film. In most cases, these pumps require external 
connections to the tank resulting in maintenance 
problems due to leakage at the connections. In 
addition a substantial amount of energy is expended in 
moving fluid through the restrictive plumbing system. Some of the problems discussed above are 
alleviated by the processor designs disclosed in 
US-A-4 994 840, US-A-4 989 028, US-A-5 136 323, 
US-A-5 172 153 and US-A-5 239 327. Such patents and 
applications disclose processing apparatus which 
process a web while it is positioned in a plane or 
transported through a path without the use complicated 
roller transport apparatus. In US-A-5 136 323 and US-A-5 172 153 there 
are disclosed parallel
