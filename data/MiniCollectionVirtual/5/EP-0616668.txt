<ABSTRACT>
A differential mechanism (10) having two output cam members (16, 17) rotatable about an axis (A) each cam member having an annular cam surface of undulating form comprising pairs of mutually inclined surfaces (24, 25; 26, 27). The inclined surfaces are engaged by end surfaces (29, 30) of cam followers (28) so that relative contra rotation of the output cam members (16, 17) causes the cam followers to slide axially. An input element (11-14) engages and supports the followers (28) and moves the followers circumferentially relative to the output cam members and a component (11, 14) of the differential which rotates during use of the differential drives oil pump means (70) for forcing oil into the differential.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a differential mechanism
particularly but not exclusively for use in motor vehicles.Differential mechanisms commonly used on vehicles are of the
sun and planet gear type and have a well known disadvantage
that when one wheel is on a slippery surface such as mud or
ice and the other wheel is on a firm surface capable of
providing traction, the first wheel will simply spin as it
receives all the available power transmitted to the
differential.Limited slip differential mechanisms have been proposed in
an attempt to overcome this problem which restrict the
extent to which one wheel can spin relative to the other but
such differentials are more complex and, therefore, more
costly to produce.In European patent application EP-A-0284329 there is
proposed an alternative differential mechanism comprising a
housing which contains two axially spaced output cam members
rotatable about an axis, with each cam member having a
single annular cam surface thereon of undulating form
comprising pairs of mutually inclined surfaces, and a
plurality of cam followers displaced axially between the
output cam members and having end surfaces engaging the cam
surfaces of the output cam members, the arrangement being
such that relative contra rotation of said output cam 
members causes the cam followers to slide axially generally
parallel to said axis, and an input element engaging and
supporting the followers and moving the followers
circumferentially relative to the output cam members.Such a differential will hereinafter be called a
differential of the type described.It is desirable to lubricate the relatively moving surfaces
within such a differential to keep wear to a minimum.US-A-2790334 discloses a gearless differential with radially
moveable cam followers within a housing having external oil
vanes which introduce oil into a radially outer portion of
the housing.According to the invention there is provided a differential
of the type described, characterised in that the housing of
the differential carries on its exterior oil pump means
for forcing oil into the housing through axially
extending passages in the housing and output cam members to
a location radially inward of said co-operating cam
surfaces and followers for subsequent radially outward
dispersal within the housing, said housing containing the
oil against exit therefrom at locations radially
outward of said co-operating cam surfaces and followers.By introducing oil into the housing at a location radially
inward of the co-operating cam

surface (52) of the respective output cam member.
A differential as claimed in claim 6 characterised in
that the axially outer surface (52) of each output

cam member (16,17) is provided with an annular groove
(16a,17a) which provides an oil flow link between the

axially outer ends of the or each axial oil
