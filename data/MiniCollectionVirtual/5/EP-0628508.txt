<ABSTRACT>
In a yarning machine including a drum (7) having 
transverse grooves (8) to move a yarn thread (5) transversely 

therealong so as to supply the yarn thread to a wind-up package 
(9) by rotating the wind-up package (9), a wheel (11) has a V-shaped 

groove (12) around its centre and a flange (15a,15b) whose 
inner wall is continuous from an inner wall of the groove (12) by 

way of stepped portion (14a, 14b), the inner wall of the groove 
(12) being inclined so that the distance changes gradually from 

the centre of the groove (12) to a cam-like outer periphery 
(13a,13b) of the inner wall of the flange (15a,15b) in accordance 

with the increase of a rotational angle of the wheel (11). The 
wheel (11) serves as a guide which introduces the yarn thread (5) 

to a wind-up package (9), the yarn being rotatably supported by 
the wheel (11). The axis of the wheel (11) is obliquely across 

that of the drum (7) so that the yarn thread (5) slidingly runs 
along the inner wall of the groove (12) or the inner wall of the 

flange (15a,15b) in combination with the rotational movement of 
the wheel (11) before the yarn thread (5) is supplied to the drum 

(7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a yarning (or doubling)
machine which winds a plurality of threads up together to form
one yarn (known as a doubled yarn).In this type of yarning machine, a drum has been used
widely which has transverse grooves in order to transversely move
a yarn to supply it to a wind-up package while rotating the wind-up
package. JP-U-4/40,778 and JP-U-2/46,875 represent the
closest prior art known to the applicant.Upon uniting a long-fibrous thread and short-fibrous
thread together in which the long-fibrous thread is made of a
synthetic fibre such as nylon, polyester or the like, while the
short-fibrous thread made of natural fibre such as cotton, wool
or the like, the long-fibrous thread is however, likely to be
overfed so that the long-fibrous thread is separated from the
short-fibrous thread. When the separated part of the yarn
reaches an intersection of the transverse grooves of the drum,
the separated thread tends to enter the reversely defined helical
groove causing an unfavourable split winding.The cause of the separation of the yarn is assumed as
follows:In this type of yarning machine, a metallic roller 51
is generally provided which has a groove to introduce a yarn 54
to the drum as shown in Fig 8. Since an inner wall of its groove
is plated by chromium (Cr), a static charge occurs due to
friction between the yarn 54 and the metallic roller 51 during
the process in which the yarn 54 of the long-and short-fibrous
threads 52a, 52b united together at a collecting unit 53 
slidingly runs through the metallic roller 51. The static
electricity tends to attract the long-fibrous thread 52a towards
the smooth outer surface of the metallic roller 51 rather than
the short-fibrous thread 52b. This causes the long-fibrous
thread 52a to temporarily stick to the outer surface of the
metallic roller 51 so as to slacken the thread 52a at a releasing
side of the metallic roller 51.With this in mind, the present invention is made after
delving deeper into the behaviour of the yarn on the roller so as
to avoid the above drawbacks.Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide
a yarning machine which is capable of effectively preventing the
yarn from inadvertently entering the reversely defined helical
groove so as to avoid an unfavourably split winding when the
separated part of the yarn reaches an intersection of transverse
grooves of the drum.This can be achieved by the relative orientation of the
running direction of the threads and the axis of the
wheel/groove.Thus in one form, according
