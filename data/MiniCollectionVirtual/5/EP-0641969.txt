<ABSTRACT>
In a burning device for wood, coal or biomass, the interior of which is divided into a precombustion chamber (1) and a secondary combustion chamber (2) and in which a nozzle configuration elongated in a direction at right angles to its throughflow direction is provided in the parting plane between the precombustion chamber (1) and the secondary combustion chamber (2), and this nozzle configuration is surrounded on the outside at least partly by an air duct (9) for secondary air, this air duct being closed relative to precombustion chamber and secondary combustion chamber and having air-outlet openings (7) in the direction of the nozzle configuration, several elongated nozzle configurations (3) are provided in the area of the parting plane between precombustion chamber and secondary combustion chamber with regard to the best combustion and emission ratios even in the case of large heating capacities and thus large sizes. In this arrangement, in each case two adjacent nozzle configurations are separated from one another by a hollow body (4), and the interior of all hollow bodies is connected to the air duct, and the hollow bodies have air-outlet openings (7) in the area of the parting plane.

An burning device for burning wood, coal or biomass, the interior of the 
device being divided up into a preburning chamber and an afterburning chamber, 

with several elongated nozzle formations (3) that are positioned essentially at 
right angles to their flow direction being provided in the area of the partition level 

between these chambers, the exteriors of these nozzle formations being at least 
partially surrounded by an airduct for secondary burning air which is closed 

towards the preburning chamber and the afterburning chamber and which has air 
outlet openings leading to the interior of the nozzle formations, two adjacent 

nozzle formations (3) each being separated from each other by a hollow body (4), 
the interior of all hollow bodies (4) being connected to the airduct (9) for air flow, 

and the hollow bodies (4) in the area of the partition level between the preburning 
chamber (1) and the afterburning chamber (2) being provided with air outlet 

openings (7). 
A device according to claim 1 characterized in that at least one hollow 
body (4) is at a continuously increasing distance at its surface facing the 

preburning chamber (1) at the cross-section of the hollow body's two logitudinal 
sides to its longitudinal median line from the level it shares with the nozzle 

formations (3) jointly formed by it and them. 
A device according to claim 2 characterized in that the surface (5) of at 
least one hollow body (4) which faces the preburning chamber (1) is in the shape 

of a partial circle, in particular of a semicircle, the center of which is located 
approximately in the area of the partition level. 
A device according to claim 2 or 3 characterized in that the surface (6) of 
at least one hollow body (4) which faces the afterburning chamber (2) is 

approximately in the shape of a partial circle, in particular of a semicircle, the 
center of which is located approximately in the area of the partition level. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 4 characterized in that at 
least one hollow body (4) is at a continuously decreasing distance at its surface 

(6) facing the afterburning chamber (2) at the cross section of the hollow body's 
two logitudinal sides to its longitudinal median line from the level it shares with the 

nozzle formations (3) jointly formed by it and them.  
 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 4 characterized in that at 
least one hollow body (4) is at the same constant distance at its surface (6) facing 

the afterburning chamber (2) from the partition level between the preburning 
chamber (1 ) and the afterburning chamber (2). 
A device according to claim 1 characterized in that at least one hollow 
body (4) has a triangular shape cross-sectionally, with one side of the triangle 

extending approximately parallel to the partition level, and the opposite side of the 
triangle facing the preburning chamber (1). 
An burning device according to at least one of claims 1 to 7 characterized 
in that the air outlet openings (7) have the shape of slits and are located in the 

circumference area of the hollow bodies (4) which face both the afterburning 
chamber (2) and the nozzle formations (3). 
An burning device according to claim 8 characterized in that the air outlet 
slits are offset in the aforementioned circumference area of the hollow bodies (4) 

by 10° to 25° in relation to the level of the partition wall. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding claims characterized 
in that the air outlet openings (7) are essentially shaped as openings or slits 

positioned at a diagonal angle to the partition wall level and, at the same time, 
directed towards the afterburning chamber (2), and in that they are located in the 

circumference area of the hollow bodies (4) facing the afterburning chamber (2). 
A device according to claims 2 to 10 characterized in that the hollow 
bodies (4) are provided with short surface extension parts (8) that are oriented 

towards the afterburning chamber (2) and that have exposed ends. 
A device according to claim 1 characterized in that the nozzle formations 
(3) have, in the case of the preburning chamber (1) being placed above the 

afterburning chamber (2), a width of 6 mm to 12 mm, and, in the case of the 
preburning chamber (1) being placed in front of, behind or at the side of the
