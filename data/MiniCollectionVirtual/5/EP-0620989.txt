<ABSTRACT>
An applicator (1) for applying a fluid such as eye 
shadow. The applicator comprises a tubular core (4) having a 

conduit (6), and a porous outer membrane (5) arranged to cover 
the tip of the tubular core (4). The outlet (7) of the conduit (6) 

of the tubular core (4) is formed so that the outlet (7) opens in 
the tubular core (4) on one side of the tubular core (4) from the 

longitudinal axis of the tubular core (4). Therefore, it is 
possible to apply a fluid to a surface, such as skin of a 

human being, by using one side of the applicator through 
which the fluid easily soaks, and to spread and gradate 

the fluid on the surface, by using the other side of the 
applicator. The outer membrane (5) may be made from two or 

three porous sheet members having different porosities 
from each other, so that a fluid easily soaks through one 

of the porous sheet members having a relatively large 
porosity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an applicator for
applying a fluid according to the preamble of claim 1,
for example, a fluid cosmetic such as a liquid eye
shadow.A known applicator for applying a fluid comprises a
tubular core for introducing a fluid from a reservoir and
discharging the fluid from an outlet arranged at the
distal end of the applicator, and an elastic porous outer
membrane, such as urethane foam permeable to a fluid, in
the shape of a bag, covering the tip portion of the
tubular core (US-A-4 002 182). In the conventional
applicator, a fluid uniformly soaks through an aperture
of the outer membrane, arranged through the applicator's
longitudinal axis. The upper part of the tubular core is
formed by cutting out a portion of said tubular core
along a plane inclined to the longitudinal axis. This
arrangement is disadvantageous since the tip of the
tubular core comprises a sharp edge along the outer
periphery of the rounded tip along the flat surface,
which may cause harm to the outer membrane when the
applicator is used. Furthermore, the outer membrane of
the known applicator has a complicated geometrical shape
in order to match with the tubular core. In an actual
operation for applying a cosmetic to a skin of a human
being, it is necessary to spread and graduate the
cosmetic after the cosmetic is applied to the skin. The
conventional applicator is not adapted to carry out these
operations because a fluid uniformly soaks through the 
substantially entire area of the top of the outer
membrane, and it is disadvantageous and inevitable that a
finger or a brush or else must be used for spreading and
graduating the cosmetic.The object of the present invention is to provide an
applicator for applying a fluid, which is easily
constructed and can be used not only for applying a fluid
to a surface but for spreading and graduating the fluid
on the surface.According to the present invention, there is provided an
applicator for applying a fluid comprising a tubular core
having a longitudinal axis, a generally rounded tip,
a generally rounded tip, and a conduit extending along
the longitudinal axis, the conduit having an inlet
adapted to receive a fluid and an outlet; a porous outer
membrane permeable to a fluid and arranged to cover at
least a portion of the tubular core including the outlet
of the conduit; wherein the outer membrane includes an
aperture and wherein the outlet of the conduit of the
tubular core is formed by cutting out a portion of the
tubular core along a plane inclined to the
