<ABSTRACT>
An end piece or barrel head (1) for an axial slack adjuster is at its outer periphery connected to a barrel (2) of the adjuster and is arranged around a rotatably and axially movable tube (3). The end piece is provided with an internal, circumferential groove (4), connected to the exterior by means of a number of channels (5) opening in the end wall (1') of the end piece for allowing water collected in the groove to freely pass out to the exterior.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an end piece for a rail vehicle 
axial slack adjuster, at its outer periphery connected 
to a barrel of the adjuster and sealingly cooperating 
with a tube, which is rotatably and axially movable 
relative to the end piece. Rail vehicle slack adjusters work in an extremely 
harsh environment underneath the vehicles, which means 
that the sealing arrangements have to be effective so 
as to protect all interior details against moist, 
water, snow, dust and so forth. The problem is enhanced 
by the extremely long intervals between interior 
services of the slack adjusters. At an end piece or barrel head of the kind defined 
above it has so far been customary to provide as tight 
sealings as possible between the tube and the end 
piece, for example by means of two effective sealing 
rings in the end piece. However, due to the mutual 
movements between the parts, a certain under-pressure 
could be created inside the slack adjuster sucking 
moist, water and dust into the adjuster without any 
possibility to get out again. It goes without saying 
that such contaminants inside the adjuster can cause 
harm. The present invention is based on the different 
philosophy that the creation of an under-pressure 
inside the adjuster shall be obviated and that any 
contaminants entering the end piece around the tube 
shall be given the opportunity to leave without getting 
into the adjuster itself. This is according to the invention attained in 
that the end piece is provided with an internal, 
circumferential groove around the tube and that this 
groove is connected to the exterior by means of a  
 
number of channels opening in the end wall of the end 
piece. These channels have the purpose of allowing any 
contaminants collected in the groove to freely pass out 
to the exterior. As the way out through the channels is 
so easy to follow, no contaminants will continue into 
the adjuster. SE-B-399675 shows an end piece with an internal groove but no channels. The invention will be described in further detail 
below reference being made to the accompanying drawing, 
in which Fig 1 is an end-view of an end piece according 
to the invention and Fig 2 is a side-view, partly in 
section, of an axial slack adjuster provided with such 
an end piece, shown in a section along the line II-II 
in Fig 1. A cylindrical end piece or barrel head 1 is 
attached to a tubular barrel 2 of a conventional axial 
slack adjuster for a railway vehicle. It is to co-operate 
with a rotatably and axially movable tube 3
