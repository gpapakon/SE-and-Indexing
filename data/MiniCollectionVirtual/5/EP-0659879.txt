<ABSTRACT>
Bordetella
 species, such as 
Bordetella
pertussis
, is 
grown under aerobic conditions in a liquid culture medium 

containing nutrients for such growth. Enhanced cell density 
and antigen production are achieved by continuously determining 

the pH of the culture medium and, in response to such 
determination, simultaneously feeding, as required, (a) an 

acid, usually a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, 
phosphoric acid or sulphuric acid, in a concentration 

sufficient to maintain the pH of the culture medium within a 
predetermined range of values, usually about pH 6.8 to about 

pH 7.3, and (b) a nutrient medium containing organic carbon 
and organic nitrogen, usually a neutral salt of an amino acid, 

such as monosodium glutamate, an amino acid, such as glutamic 
acid, or a mixture thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for 
the control of pH during the growth of a Bordetella 
organism, particularly Bordetellapertussis, which also 
provides nutrients for Bordetella growth to the culture 
medium, resulting in improved production of materials 
used in pertussis vaccines. The severe respiratory disease pertussis (whooping 
cough) is caused by localized infection by Bordetellapertussis. A common vaccine against such disease 
comprises inactivated Bordetellapertussis. The organism 
is grown in a culture medium and then inactivated by 
formaldehyde to provide the inactivated B. pertussis. The initial culture medium for Bordetella growth is 
made up from sources of organic carbon and organic 
nitrogen, as well as inorganic salts, vitamins and amino 
acids. Materials often used to provide such sources 
include casamino acid, sodium glutamate, proline, 
cysteine and glutamic acid. Following adjustment to the 
desired pH, cultures of the organism are grown under 
aerobic conditions to a desired cell density. It is known to effect control of the pH of the 
culture medium within a desired range during the 
fermentation by employing acid or alkali, as necessary. 
In general, the fermentation medium tends to drift 
towards more alkaline values during the fermentation and 
hence pH adjustment usually is effected using acid during 
the fermentation operation. In accordance with the present invention, an 
improved procedure is provided for the batch fermentation 
of Bordetella organisms, particularly Bordetellapertussis, under aerobic conditions to high cell density 
and high antigen production. The batch fermentation is effected in a liquid 
culture medium containing nutrients for growth of the 
organism, usually a source of carbon, nitrogen, salts and 
vitamins. The pH of the culture medium is continuously 
determined during growth of the organism and, in response 
to such determination, there is simultaneously fed to the 
culture medium, as required, (a) an acid in a 
concentration sufficient to maintain the pH of the 
culture medium within a predetermined range of values 
during growth of the organism and (b) a nutrient medium 
for cell growth containing organic carbon and organic 
nitrogen. By effecting such simultaneous feed of acid and 
nutrients to the culture medium in response to changes in 
pH, high cell density and antigen production are 
achieved. Since changes in pH result from cell growth, 
the process of the invention is self-limiting with 
respect to cell growth during the
