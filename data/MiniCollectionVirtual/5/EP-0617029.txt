<ABSTRACT>
Methods for purifying 1,4-dioxan-2-one include dissolving 
a crude reaction product containing 1,4-dioxan-2-one in an 

aliphatic ester solvent, forming crystals of 1,4-dioxan-2-one, 
and filtering the mixture to recover solids containing 

crystalline 1,4-dioxan-2-one which is relatively pure compared 
to the crude reaction product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods of purifying 
1,4-dioxan-2-one. More particularly, this invention relates 
to the purification of 1,4-dioxan-2-one by recrystallization 
using a solvent comprising an aliphatic ester. Polymers made from 1,4-dioxan-4-one (also known as p-dioxanone) 
have been employed in the manufacture of absorbable 
surgical devices. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,052,988 
to Doddi et al. The preparation of the p-dioxanone monomer is 
described by Doddi et al. as involving the reaction of 
ethylene glycol, metallic sodium and chloroacetic acid. After 
several steps including distillation, washing with acetone, 
addition of hydrochloric acid, precipitation with ethanol, 
filtration, heating and further distillation, Doddi et al. 
report that the purity of the crude dioxanone product is about 
60-70 percent (See Example 1 of Doddi et al.). Doddi et al. 
further state that "exceptionally high purity of p-dioxanone 
monomer is required" to produce strong fibers of 
polydioxanone. However, although recognizing that high purity 
is required, Doddi et al. provide no details on how to achieve 
the required high purity, but rather merely state that the 
monomer is "finally purified to 99+% by multiple 
crystallizations and/or distillations" (See Doddi et al. 
column 4, lines 31-34). More recent patents directed to polymers made at least 
impart from p-dioxanone include U.S. Patent Nos. 4,643,191; 
4,646,741; 4,653,497; 4,788,979; 4,838,267; 5,047,048; 
5,007,923; 5,076,807; and 5,080,665. However, the steps 
necessary to achieve purification of the p-dioxanone monomer 
are not described in detail in these references.  
 U.S. Patent No. 3,020,289 to Welpert describes the preparation 
of 2-p-dioxanone by passing vaporized diethylene glycol through 
a bed of copper chromite catalyst, with subsequent purification 
by fractional distillation. The p-dioxanone used in Example 1 
of U.S. Patent No. 3,063,967 to Schultz was twice distilled 
under nitrogen, presumably for purification. Other patents 
relating to the polymerization of p-dioxanone include U.S. 
Patent No. 3,190,858; 3,391,126; and 3,645,941. Purification 
of 1,4-dioxan-2-one by recrystallisation from benzene/ligroin 
is disclosed in Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft, 
27, pp 2939-2952 (1894). It has now been found that 1,4-dioxan-2-one can be 
purified by recrystallisation from an aliphatic ester solvent. 
The method of the present invention includes the steps of: 
forming a solution by dissolving a crude
