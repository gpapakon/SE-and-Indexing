<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing a shell-like pipe insulation, provided with at least one longitudinal slit, from a material consisting of fibres. Sheep's wool is provided according to the invention as a fibrous material, the sheep's wool being moistened with water and being shaped in an entry funnel to form a tubular strand, whereupon the water is removed from the tubular strand by evaporation and the strand is, if appropriate, slit longitudinally.

<CLAIMS>
Process to manufacture a sleeve-shaped pipe insulation provided with at least
one longitudinal slit, made from fibrous material, wherein, the fibrous material

is virgin wool, where the virgin wool is dampend with water and formed into a
tubular strip in a feeding hopper, whereupon the water is removed from the

tubular strip by evaporation and the strip is possibly provided with a
longitudinal slit.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the virgin wool is carded at first, then
blown into the feeding hopper, dampend during the moulding process in the

feeding hopper and following the moulding process dried and slit longitudinally.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the virgin wool is at least slightly
needled and then in a continuous operation joined 
to a tubular strip, where a
longitudinal seam is formed and where the virgin wool ist dampend prior to and

during the moulding process and dried after being re-moulded.
Process according to one of the previous claims, wherein during the manufacturing
process an outer layer is placed onto the tubular strip. 
Process according to claim 4, wherein the outer layer also consists of virgin
wool.
Process according to one of the previous claims, wherein the evaporation of the
water ist achieved by heating with microwave radiation.
Process according to claim 6, wherein heating with microwave radiation is done
in a continuous operation.
