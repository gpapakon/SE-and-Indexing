<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna and more
particularly to a radar system and components therefore for
transmitting an electromagnetic signal from above the
surface of water to below the surface of water to detect
anomalies below the surface of water.As is known in the art, it is often desirable to detect
the present of objects under the surface of water.
Typically, conventional underwater detection systems operate
on acoustic principles. That is, acoustic energy is
transmitted in the water medium and echo return signals are
received and processed to determine the presence of objects.
However, acoustic signal propagation requires a transmitting
transducer and a receiving transducer be disposed in the
water medium. If an underwater detection system is utilized
from an aircraft (i.e. airplane, helicopter, etc.), then the
transmitting transducer and the receiving transducer must be
suspended from a cable or a towline attached to the aircraft
with the transmitting transducer and the receiving
transducer disposed below the water's surface.
Unfortunately, such an arrangement reduces the mobility of
the aircraft and the rate of searching capability of the
system. Thus, it is desirable to not require transducers 
disposed in the water for an underwater detection system
utilized from an aircraft.An alternative technique for detecting objects is
utilizing a radar system transmitting electromagnetic
signals. Electromagnetic signals propagate effectively in
air and couple suitably to sea water. Unfortunately,
electromagnetic signals do not propagate well in a water
medium wherein the signals are subjected to a high rate of
attenuation. In sea water, an electromagnetic signal is
typically attenuated 8.68 dB per skin depth. Skin depth is
frequency dependent and typically with a frequency of 1 Hz,
the skin depth is 252 meters, with a frequency of 100 Hz,
the skin depth is 25.2 meters and with a frequency of 10
KHz, the skin depth is only 2.52 meters. If a signal having
a frequency of 100 Hz is propagating through sea water a
distance of 1,000 meters, then the signal would have
travelled a distance of approximately 40 skin depths which
equals 347 dB of attenuation. From the latter, it should be
appreciated that it is desirable to use relatively low
frequency electromagnetic signals if the signal is required
to penetrate the surface of the water a significant amount
of distance.An electric antenna for transmitting an electromagnetic
signal is typically a multiple of an one-half wavelength or
variant thereof such that
