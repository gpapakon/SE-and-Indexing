<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous casting of the metal is disclosed, in particular of steel, for producing billets and blooms with a polygonal or approximately round cross-section. In order to improve chilling within the mould, thus achieving a better casting quality, and to optimize the casting process in the case of various operations, steels is introduced in a mould (3) with a cross-section at the pouring side that has sections (2) with bulges (9) distributed around the circumference of the mould cavity (6). The bulging skin that is created in the mould (3) is formed along at least a partial length of the mould (3). The extent of bulge elimination (9) is determined by setting a corresponding level of the bath within said partial length of the mould (3) as a function of the casting parameters.

Process for the continuous casting of metal, in 
particular of steel, wherein the steel is cast in a 

mould (3), whose mould cavity cross-section is larger on 
the inlet side (4) than on the strand outlet side (5), 

and the cross-section of a partly solidified strand is 
deformed upon passing through the mould (3) at least 

along part of the length (12) of the mould (3), 
characterised in that, in the casting of billets and 

blooms 

with polygonal cross-sections a strand crust having 
evenly distributed convexities (9) between all the 

corners (8-8''') or 
with approximately round cross-sections a strand 
crust with at least three convexities (9) evenly 

distributed over the cross-sectional circumference 
of the strand 
 
is brought to solidify on the inlet side (4) of the 

mould (3), and on passing through the mould (3), the 
convexities (9) are reformed to a degree (36) and the 

strand cross- section is altered, and in that the degree 
of reforming (36) of the convexities (9) is governed by 

the setting of a corresponding bath level (35, 35') 
within the partial length (12, 39) of the mould (3) as a 

function of the casting parameters, such as steel 
composition, casting speed, overheating temperature of 

the steel in the intermediate vessel, friction between 
the strand and mould, or drawing force at the driver. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
degree of reforming (36) of the convexity (9) is fixed 

in mm.  
 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the degree of reforming (36) of the convexity (9) is 

determined as a function of the steel analysis and the 
selected casting speed. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised 
in that the degree of reforming (36) of the convexity 

(9) is determined as a function of the overheating 
and/or casting temperature. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 4, characterised 
in that the degree of reforming (36) of the convexity 

(9) is set in a mathematical function relative to the 
casting speed. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 5, characterised 
in that the degree of reforming (36) of the convexity 

(9) is determined as a function of the friction measured 
between the strand and the mould. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
degree of reforming (36) of the convexity (9) is 

constantly adapted to an optimised coefficient of 
friction. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 7, characterised 
in that due to the reforming of the convexities (9) 

between the casting level (35) and the end of the 
partial length (12) the strand cross-section is reduced 

by 4 % - 15 %, preferably by 6 % - 10 %. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 8, characterised 
in that the momentary casting parameters (41 - 45), such 

as steel analysis, overheating and steel temperature in 
the intermediate vessel, casting speed, strand 

cross-section, conicity and length of the convexity of  
 

the mould cavity, casting lubricant, coefficients of 
friction etc., are fed to a computer (40), are compared 

with corresponding reference values, and in the case of 
deviation the degree of reference reforming and 

convexity is established and the correction of the 
reference bath level is fed to the control (46). 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 9, characterised 
in that the strand being formed is cooled inside the 

mould over a primary cooling section of between 500 and 
1000 mm as a function of the momentary casting 

parameters (41 - 45). 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 10, characterised 
in that a partial length (12) up to 60 % of the mould 

length is selected for reforming the convexity of the 
strand crust. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 11, characterised 
in that the degree of reforming (36) of the convexity 

(9) is determined as a function of the heat flow density 
in the mould, preferably in the partial length (12).
