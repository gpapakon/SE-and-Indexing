<ABSTRACT>
A major histocompatibility complex class I antigen is useful as a vaccine against an immunodeficiency virus. The antigen may be a human class I antigen such as an HLA-A, HLA-B or HLA-C antigen or (beta)2 microglobulin. The virus may be a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as HIV-1 or HIV-2.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX ANTIGEN FOR USE ASVACCINE AGAINST AN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS- 1 -VACCINES This invention relates to vaccines against immunodeficiency viruses.Cyno olgus macaques vaccinated with either inactivated partially purified simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) , fixed SIV-infected C8166 (a human T lymphoblastoid cell line) cells or fixed uninfected C8166 cells can be protected against a challenge infection with the 32H isolate of SIVmac 251 (grown in C8166)1'2. Protection is correlated with the levels of antibody response to cellular antigens in the human cells from which the virus immunogen was grown 2"6. However, the mechanism of protection is unclear.We have analyzed sera from these monkeys. We have found that there is positive correlation of protection with antibody response to the HLA class I molecule. Furthermore, sera from protected monkeys inhibited xenoantigen but not alloantigen-induced monkey T cell proliferation in vitro and the inhibition could be blocked by adsorption with murine P815 cells transfected with human HLA class I genes.Accordingly, the invention provides a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, in particular for use as a vaccine against an immunodeficiency virus.The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable rcarrier or diluent and, as active ingredient, a MHC class I antigen. The invention further provides use of a MHC classI antigen in the manufacture of a medicament for use as a vaccine against an immunodeficiency virus.The antigen is preferably a human class I antigen. The class I molecule may therefore be HLA-A, HLA- B or HLA-C or /32-microglobulin (02m) which is the 0-chain of the HLA class I molecule. The antigen may be the entire 

class I molecule in which the heavy chain is HLA-A, HLA-B or HLA-C. These are known antigens and can be obtained in purified form. They may be prepared as recombinant proteins. Alternatively, the class I antigen may be given presented by transfected cells, i.e. by cells transfected with a gene encoding the antigen and which consequently express the antigen. Transfected cells which may be administered to a human may be transfected cells of a human diploid cell line. Such cell lines have been tested for safety for the purpose of human vaccine manufacture. An appropriate cell line is the MRC5 cell line.Allogenic lymphocytes which present a class I antigen may be administered to a
