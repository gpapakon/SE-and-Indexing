<DESCRIPTION>
Various systems for protecting metal pipelines such as those which are intended for 
inground implantation and which are subjected to degradative environmental forces such as 
corrosion are known in the art, many of which require the heating of the pipe surface in 
order to apply a protective coating or wrap thereto. Typically, this heating is accomplished by flame fired from a source of butane. This 
standard method of heating the pipe surface suffers from certain inherent disadvantages, 
chief of which is the difficulty of applying a uniform heat around the circumference of the 
pipe. This problem is particularly apparent when the heating and subsequent pipe coating 
is to take place over the ditch prior to implanting. As will be appreciated, heating the 
underside of the pipe over the ditch is difficult. Another problem confronting the user is 
the inherent danger of the user being burned due to wind blowing the flame. Stated simply, the task of this invention is to devise an alternate means of applying 
heat to the pipe, which means provides a uniform desired heat around the entire 
circumference of the pipe in a manner which is safe to the user.  In accordance with this invention, the task is solved in an elegant manner by 
providing an electrical heating device having at least two arcuate sections hinged together, 
the free ends of the outer two sections being pivotable from an open position enabling 
placement over the pipe at the desired location for applying heat to a closed position where 
the device encircles the pipe circumference. Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the heating system of this invention; Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the heating element in its open position for placement 
around a pipe; Fig. 3 is perspective view of the heating element in its closed position encircling a 
pipe; and Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along lines 4-4 in Fig. 3. As was heretofore mentioned, various systems are known which require heat to be 
applied to a pipe's surface in order to provide a protective coating to the pipe. For 
instance, systems are known where the metal surface of the pipe is initially heated in 
preparation of applying a heat-fusible coating or pipewrap over the thus heated surface. 
Another procedure requiring heat is the application of a heat-shrinkable 
sleeve over the pipe 
joint where two sections of pipe have been welded together. In these and other procedures  
 
utilizing a heating step in the application of protective coating to the pipe, it will be 
appreciated that it is

<CLAIMS>
A device adapted for applying a uniform desired heat to the circumference 
of a portion of a metal pipe surface comprising a plurality of arcuate sections, each section 

comprising an outer rigid shell and an inner electrically resistive heating element which, 
upon impressing an electrical current will emit heat for heating the metal pipe surface, each 

arcuate section having opposed end edges and opposed side edges defining the dimensions 
of the section, each section being pivotally connected to the next adjacent section along 

opposed side edges whereby to form an interconnected length of sections having opposed 
free side edges; means for releasably securing the opposed free side edges together to define 

a substantially circular jacket adapted to encircle a pipe surface when the device is wrapped 
around the pipe and the free side edges are then secured together; and means for connecting 

the electrically heat resistive element to a source of electricity. 
A device as defined in Claim 1 wherein each of the arcuate sections has an 
intermediate insulating layer disposed between the outer shell and the inner heating element. 
A device as defined in Claim 1 wherein the opposed inner end edges of each 
section has a heat-resistant compressible element secured thereto, the heat-resistant 

elements 
on the opposed end edges of the interconnected sections together defining opposed 

compressible seals for preventing heat loss when the device is secured around the pipe surface. 
A device as defined in Claim 1 wherein the device consists of only two 
arcuate sections. 
A device as defined in Claim 1 including means for controlling the time and 
temperature of a heating cycle for applying heat to the pipe surface.
