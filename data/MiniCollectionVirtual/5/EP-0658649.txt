<ABSTRACT>
A belt for a long nip press is constructed of a 
nonwoven spiral-type base or carrier which is coated with 

a solidified urethane coating material. The urethane 
coating is at least coextensive with the upper and lower 

surfaces of the spiral-type base, and at least one surface 
of the coating is preferably spaced above a surface 

of the base so as to embed the base within the coating. 
The coating solidifies to form a unitary endless belt 

with the base embedded therewithin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an endless belt for 
use in a long nip press. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a press jacket used on a sleeve type of 
long nip press such as the Voith Flexonip press, or to 
belting used on a Beloit-type long nip press. Hereafter, 
such a press jacket or belting will be referred to as a 
belt. A long nip press is used in a papermaking 
machine to dewater a fibrous web. The belt is typically 
used in combination with a felt, which functions to 
support the web between the belt and a cylindrical press 
roller. The belt is engaged by an arcuate pressure shoe, 
which includes a concave surface. The roller and the 
shoe cooperate to define a long nip through which the 
belt, felt and web pass to increase the dewatering of the 
web when compared to conventional nips on a papermaking 
machine. Prior art long nip press belts have been constructed 
of a woven fabric coated and impregnated with a 
polymeric resin, such as polyurethane. Grooves may be 
formed in the outer surface of the belt for receiving 
water from the felt and web. Representative patents of 
this type include Dutt U.S. Patent 4,946,731; Stigberg 
U.S. Patent 5,196,092; Cronin et al International Publication 
No. W087/02080 (International Application No. 
PCT/US85/01953); Dutt U.S. Patent 5,234,551; and Dutt 
U.S. Patent 5,238,537. It is an object of the present invention to 
advance the state of the art in long nip press belts by 
forming the belt of a nonwoven base or reinforcing material, 
which is impregnated and coated with a conventional 
polymeric resin material, such as polyurethane. It is a 
further object of the invention to provide a long nip  
 
press belt which is relatively simple to construct while 
providing significant advantages in operation. The prior art has utilized a synthetic base 
structure woven on a textile loom using multiple sheds or 
harnesses. Typically, this structure is stabilized and 
seamed to form an endless base. The present invention 
teaches use of a non-woven synthetic base structure 
incorporating preformed loops joined with connecting rods 
to form a uniform endless base. Advantages offered by 
the invention include ease of manufacture in that preparation 
steps such as weaving and seaming are eliminated. 
Elimination of these process steps provides significant 
improvement in manufacturing flexibility. Additional 
benefits include improved uniformity and coatability of 
the base structure. In accordance with the invention, a long nip 
press belt is formed of a

<CLAIMS>
An endless, impervious belt for a long nip 
press, comprising: 

   a nonwoven spiral-type base defining a first 
surface and a second surface and including a series of 

axially extending side-by-side spirals, each spiral 
defining an internal space, wherein the spirals are 

interconnected by a series of substantially parallel 
connector rods extending through the internal spaces of 

adjacent spirals; and 
   a polymeric resin coating applied to the spiral 

base, the polymeric resin coating filling the internal 
spaces of the spirals and extending at least coextensively 

with the first and second surfaces of the base. 
The belt of claim 1, wherein the polymeric 
resin coating extends past at least one of the first and 

second surfaces of the base. 
The belt of claim 2, wherein the polymeric 
resin coating extends past both the first and second 

surfaces of the base. 
The belt of claim 1, wherein the spiral-type 
base is oriented such that the longitudinal axes of 

the spirals and of the rods extends substantially perpendicular 
to the machine direction of the belt. 
An endless, impervious belt for a long nip 
press, comprising: 

   an endless polymeric resin belt defining a 
first surface and a second surface; and 

   a nonwoven spiral-type carrier embedded within 
the belt, the carrier including a series of axially 

extending side-by-side spirals, each of which defines an 
internal space, wherein the spirals are interconnected by 

a series of substantially parallel connector rods extending 
through the internal spaces of adjacent spirals, the 

carrier defining a first surface and a second surface, 
and wherein the first and second surfaces of the belt are 

 
at least coextensive with the first and second surfaces, 

respectively, of the carrier. 
The belt of claim 5, wherein the first 
surface of the carrier is disposed inwardly of the first 

surface of the belt. 
The belt of claim 6, wherein both the first 
and second surfaces of the carrier are disposed inwardly 

of the first and second surfaces, respectively, of the 
belt. 
A method of making an endless, impervious 
belt for a long nip press, comprising applying a polymeric 

resin coating to a nonwoven spiral-type base, the base 
comprising a series of axially extending side-by-side 

spirals, each of which defines an internal space, wherein 
the spirals are interconnected by a series of substantially 

parallel connector rods extending through the 
internal spaces of adjacent spirals, wherein the polymeric 

resin coating fills the internal spaces of the spirals 
and extends at least coextensively with the first and 

second surfaces of the base. 
The method of claim 8, wherein the step of 
applying the polymeric resin coating comprises applying 

the coating such that the coating extends past at least 
one of the first and second surfaces of the base. 
The method of claim 9, wherein the step of 
applying the polymeric resin coating comprises applying 

the coating such that the coating extends past both the 
first and second surfaces of the base. 
An endless, impervious belt for a long nip 
press, comprising a spiral-type carrier embedded within a 

polymeric resin base, wherein the carrier comprises a 
series of axially extending side-by-side spirals, each of
