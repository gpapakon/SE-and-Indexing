<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable compositions
containing polymers, especially coating compositions.Polyurethanes and polyureas are known to be useful in
curable compositions. They are typically prepared by reacting a
polyisocyanate and an active hydrogen-containing chain extension
agent. The polyurethane or polyurea is often capped with a
polyol or reacted with excess polyol chain extension agent to
provide it with a terminal hydroxyl group. This hydroxyl
provides an active hydrogen that serves as a functional group to
react with a curing agent such as an aminoplast resin. Other
capping agents that will provide an active hydrogen functional
group include amines, alcohol amines, and water.It is often desireable for curable compositions to
possess a variety of performance characteristics. These
characteristics include good cohesiveness, strong adhesiveness to
a variety of other materials, hardness, flexibility, scratch
resistance, mar resistance, and the like. For coating
compositions, especially for exterior coatings and most
especially for clearcoats such as automotive clearcoats,
resistance to attack by a variety of environmental elements, such
as solvents, gasoline, water, salts, acids, heat, and UV
radiation, are also desireable. While curable compositions based
on hydroxy-capped polyurethanes or polyureas and melamine curing
agents possess many desirable characteristics, they often do not
provide an optimimum combination of the above performance
charasteristics as may be desired.The present invention provides curable compositions
comprising:
(A) a carbamate-functional polymer that is the reaction product
of a mixture comprising:
(1) a polymer that is the reaction product of a mixture
comprising: 
(a) a polyisocyanate and(b) an active hydrogen-containing chain extension
agent and   (2) a compound comprising a group that is reactive with
said polymer (A) (1) and a carbamate group or group
that can be converted to carbamate, and (B) a compound having a plurality of functional groups
that are reactive with carbamate groups on said
carbamate-functional polymer.These curable compositions may be used for a
variety of applications, such as coatings, castings, and
moldings. When used for coatings, for example, they
provide durable hard coatings exhibiting many of the above
desirable characteristics for exterior coatings,
especially automotive clearcoats.Polyurethane and polyurea polymers are
well-known in the art. The polyurethanes are the reaction
product of a polyisocyanate and an active
