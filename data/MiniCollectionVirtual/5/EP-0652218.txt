<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel heterocyclic
amido compound having an excellent tachykinin receptor
antagonistic action, a method for the production
thereof and a composition containing the compound.Tachykinin is a generic term denoting a group of
neuropeptides. In mammalian animals, substance P,
neurokinin-A, neurokinin-B are known. It is also known
that by binding their respective receptors
(neurokinin -1, neurokinin-2, neurokinin-3) present in
the living body, these peptides exhibit a diversity of
biological activities.Among them, substance P is one of the
neuropeptides known for the longest time of all and
studied in the greatest detail. Its presence was
confirmed in the substance extracted from the
intestinal tubes of horses in 1931 and a peptide
consisting of 11 amino acids, the structure being
decided in 1971. Substance P is known to play a
critical role as a transmitter substance in both the
peripheral and central nervous system. This substance
is also considered to be involved in a variety of
morbid states (e.g. pain, inflammation, allergy,
urinary frequency, respiratory tract disorders, mental
diseases, etc.).As compounds having substance P receptor
antagonizing activity, the following are known.
