<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
peristaltic pumps and more particularly to precision peristaltic pumps, particularly suitable for the
simultaneous removal (aspiration) of irrigation fluids in an
eye cavity during ophthalmic surgery as, for example,
for the removal of cataracts.The necessity for precisely controlling pressure
in the eye during surgery is well-known. During
surgery on normally pressurized eyes, instruments are
passed through a small incision of the cornea in order
to access and remove
a natural lens which has become opaque from a cataract.Cataracteous lens may be broken up by
cutting apparatus or by ultrasonic apparatus and the
fractured material aspirated, together with a quantity
of aqueous irrigation fluid in the eye chamber.The removed irrigation fluid is simultaneously replaced in
order to maintain a normal pressure in the eye.While pressure may be controlled by a pressure
regulation device, greater pressure stability nay be
assured through the use of a pump having minimal back
pressure or pump pulsations.Severe reductions in the eye pressure will result
in collapse of the eye chamber, but aside from these
traumatic results, the maintenance of proper pressure
within an eye during surgical procedures is important
to preserve and stabilize the spatial relationships of
the intraocular tissues. Thus, variations of pressure 
during an operation may impair the surgeon's ability to observe and operate on
intraocular tissues.Peristaltic pumps having the features set forth in the preamble to claim 1
appended hereto are disclosed in EP-A-0 019 818 in the name of Siemens.The present invention provides a peristaltic pump having significantly reduced
pump pulsations and therefore particularly suitable for use in surgical procedures such
as those hereinabove described.A peristaltic pump in accordance with the present invention has the features
set forth in claim 1 below. A peristaltic pump in accordance with the present
invention includes a plurality of tube
compression means for compressing and sealing a
collapsible and resilient tube. Housing means is
provided for guiding the collapsible and resilient
tube to and from the tube compression means and means
are provided for causing the plurality of tube compression
means to successively contact, gradually
compress and seal the compressible and resilient tube
and thereafter gradually uncompress the tube in order
to move a fluid through the tube in one direction
without creating substantial fluid back pressure in
the opposite
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A peristaltic pump (10) comprising:

assembly head means (26) for supporting a plurality of rollers
(28), said rollers (28) being mounted in an arcuate pattern about an

assembly head axis (96), each roller (28) having a rotation axis
generally parallel to the assembly head axis (96);
a collapsible and resilient tube (32);
housing means (40) for rotatably mounting said assembly head
(26) and for guiding the collapsible and resilient tube (32) over said

rollers (28);
a pump arm (36) having an arcuate surface (34), the radius
of which arcuate surface (34) is greater than the corresponding

radius of the arc of travel of the rollers (28), the pump arm (36)
being mounted to said housing means (40) in a position enabling said

rollers (28) to compress the tube (32) against the arcuate surface
(34) as the assembly head (26) is rotated, said arcuate surface (34)

being shaped and positioned with respect to said assembly head (26)
so that as the assembly head (26) is rotated, each roller (28)

successively contacts the tube (32) and gradually seals the tube
(32) during approximately a 45Â° rotation of the assembly head (26),

said pump arm (36) being pivotally mounted to said housing means
(40); and 
means (54) for rigidly positioning and locking the pump arms
(36) in a closed position enabling said rollers (28) to compress the

tube (32) against the arcuate surface (34), characterised in that said collapsible
and resilient tube (32) comprises means for preventing movement of

the tube through the housing means, and wherein each roller (28)
has an inside diameter (118) that is smaller than roller diameters at

each end (122, 124) of each roller (28).
The peristaltic pump according to Claim 1 wherein there are four
rollers (28).
The peristaltic pump according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein each
roller (28) comprises means defining a circumferental surface

thereon, for uniformly sealing the tube as each roller compresses the
tubing.
The peristaltic pump according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 wherein
said means for preventing movement of the tube (32) comprises at

least one collar (144) disposed on said tube and having a dimension
sufficient to prevent entry of the collar into the housing means (40).
The peristaltic pump according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein
each roller (28) has a constant diameter extending between end

diameters (122, 124) of each roller (28), said end diameters (122, 
124) being greater than said constant diameter.
The peristaltic pump according to Claim 5 wherein said end diameters
(122, 124) are interconnected with said constant diameter by an

arcuate surface (126).
