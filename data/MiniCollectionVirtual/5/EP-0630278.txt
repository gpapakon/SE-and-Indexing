<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to fire extinguishing
agents which are non-toxic and environmentally safe in both
natural form and in degraded forms which may occur as a
result of exposure to fire.United States Patent No. 4,954,271, issued
September 4, 1990, Raymond W. Green, discloses and protects
environmentally amicable fire extinguishing agents comprising
in combination: (a) more than 50% by weight of a
fluorochlorocarbon selected from the group consisting of:
1,1-dichloro-2, 2, 2-trifluoroethane, and 1,2-dichloro-2,
2-difluoroethane; (b) less than 48% by weight of a fluorocarbon
selected from the group consisting of: chlorodifluoromethane,
