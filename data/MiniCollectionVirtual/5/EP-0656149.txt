<ABSTRACT>
A two step back-side hydrogenation process includes the steps of first bombarding the back side (24) of the silicon substrate (12) with hydrogen ions (30) with intensities and for a time sufficient to implant enough hydrogen atoms into the silicon substrate (12) to potentially passivate substantially all the defects and impurities in the silicon substrate (12), and then illuminating the silicon substrate (12) with electromagnetic radiation to activate the implanted hydrogen, so that it can passivate the defects and impurities in the substrate. The illumination step also annihilates the hydrogen-induced defects. The illumination step is carried out according to a two stage illumination schedule (34), the first or low power stage (38) of which subjects the substrate (12) to electromagnetic radiation having sufficient intensity to activate the implanted hydrogen, yet not drive the hydrogen from the substrate (12). The second or high power illumination stage (40) subjects the substrate (12) to higher intensity electromagnetic radiation which is sufficient to annihilate the hydrogen-induced defects and sinter/alloy the metal contacts (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hydrogenation of silicon substrates in general and in particular to an improved hydrogenation method for passivating defects in silicon solar cells.A typical silicon solar cell comprises a p-type and an n-type conductivity region in a silicon substrate and generates electricity when impinging radiation creates electron-hole pairs which migrate to the respective p-type and n-type conductivity regions. Unfortunately, certain impurities in the silicon substrate, as well as defects in the crystal lattice itself, can reduce the efficiency of the solar cell over what otherwise could be achieved if the silicon substrate were perfect and defect free. Consequently, researchers have searched for ways to minimize the effects of such defects and impurities, thus increase the overall efficiency of the cell.One method to minimize the effects of the defects and impurities is to hydrogenate the cell by implanting hydrogen into the silicon substrate. While the exact effect that hydrogen has on the substrate is not yet fully understood, it is known that the hydrogen minimizes or "passivates" the defects and impurities in the substrate. For example, many of the unit cells in the crystal lattice may be missing one or more silicon atoms, creating voids or areas where silicon atoms should be, but are not. Hydrogenating the substrate allows hydrogen atoms to fill those voids in the unit cells, thereby reducing the deleterious effects of those voids or defects. In fact, it is now well established that the performance of solar cells, as well as many other electronic devices that are fabricated on p and n doped silicon substrates, such as integrated circuits, can be improved by such hydrogen passivation. With regard to solar cells, hydrogen passivation improves cell efficiency by reducing minority carrier recombination losses at grain boundaries, dislocations, and other defects in the crystal lattice. Unfortunately, while the improved performance resulting from hydrogen passivation has been demonstrated in the laboratory, it has been difficult to apply hydrogen passivation techniques commercially, because the precise effects of hydrogenation on the silicon substrate still are not well understood.In the past, solar cells have been hydrogenated by introducing hydrogen into silicon substrate from the junction or front side of the cell by using an RF plasma or by ion implantation. However, front side hydrogenation is not without its disadvantages. For example, all of the cell processes that require
