<ABSTRACT>
A knock detecting system for internal 
combustion engines includes a heat quantity computing 

unit which derives a heat quantity produced in every 
engine cycle, on the basis of fluctuation in a 

combustion pressure waveform in which high-frequency 
components having frequencies higher than a predetermined 

cut-off frequency are removed from a fluctuation waveform 
of detected combustion pressure. The knock detecting 

system also includes a knock intensity computing unit 
which derives knock intensity on the basis of a ratio of 

a heat quantity produced by knocking to a heat quantity 
produced by normal combustion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a knock 
detecting system for internal combustion engines. More 
specifically the invention relates to a knock detecting 
system according to the precharacterizing part of claim 
1 which can determine knock intensity on the basis of 
heat quantities produced in the combustion chamber of 
the engine. Electronic control techniques have been widely used 
for vehicle and engine controls, and a variety of methods 
for decreasing and controlling knocking in internal 
combustion engines have been used. In conventional 
methods, knocking is decreased by improving the shapes 
of combustion chambers, gas flows in the combustion 
chambers or the like, or by increasing the octane number 
of the fuel. In the recent years, in addition to the 
aforementioned conventional methods, a new knock control 
technique which can be used in unmodified stock 
cars has been proposed. In the proposed technique, 
knocking control is performed by causing the spark ignition 
timing to approach the limit at which slight 
knocking, undetectable to human ears, occurs so that 
improved fuel consumption and power performance can be 
obtained under all driving conditions, regardless of a 
difference between the fuel characteristics and/or a 
change of the octane number required for the engine with 
the passage of time. Further, a system has been proposed in which this 
new knock detecting technique is used on respective 
cylinders of a 6-cylinder internal combustion engine  
 
together with an on-board knock control system using 
electronic control, knock detection and quantitative 
processing techniques. Methods for detecting knocking, which can be used 
for automotive vehicles, are classified by detected 
physical quantities. In such methods, there are various 
methods which utilize pressure in engine cylinders, vibration 
of the engine, combustion light produced in the 
combustion chamber, noise level, ion current in engine 
cylinders, and so forth. Among the aforementioned methods, one typical conventional 
knock detecting system for internal combustion 
engines is described in, for example, "Automobile 
Technique, 1986, Vol. 40, No. 11". This system detects 
high-frequency components near a knock frequency by 
fluctuation in a pressure waveform in the combustion 
chamber on the basis of output from a cylinder pressure 
sensor mounted on an ignition plug and by assigning numerical 
values to the intensities of the high-frequency 
components of the fluctuation wave form for determining 
knock

A system for detecting occurrence of knock within a cylinder of an internal 
combustion engine (1), comprising:
 
   a cylinder pressure sensor (13) mounted to the engine for monitoring 

pressure in the cylinder and generating a corresponding pressure indicative
