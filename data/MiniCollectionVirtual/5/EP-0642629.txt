<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for regulating a compressor lubrication system includes an oil-flooded rotary gas compressor, a reservoir flow connected to the compressor, a heat exchanger for cooling a lubricant, and a controller. A thermal mixing valve regulates the temperature of the lubricant flowing to the compressor. A first temperature sensor measures a discharge temperature at a compressor outlet, and provides a signal corresponding to the discharge temperature to the controller. A second temperature sensor measures a lubricant temperature at a lubricant inlet to the compressor, and provides a signal corresponding to the lubricant temperature to the controller. A pressure sensor measures the pressure at the outlet of the compressor, and provides a corresponding pressure signal to the controller. A valve means continuously regulates the supply of lubricant to the compressor, the valve means being controlled by the controller in response to the temperature signal of the first temperature sensor and the pressure signal. Operation of the thermal mixing valve is controlled by the controller, in response to the temperature signal of the second temperature sensor, to continuously regulate the temperature of the lubricant supplied to the compressor to minimize preheating of the low pressure gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to lubrication regulation systems, and 
more particularly, to rotary, screw-type gas compressors 
which inject a lubricant into the compressor both to cool 
the compressor and to provide a seal within the compressor. During rotary screw compressor operation, a pair of 
intermeshing lobed rotors rotate within a compression 
chamber. As the lobed rotors rotate, lubricant is supplied 
to the compression chamber to maintain a seal between the 
rotors and to cool the compressor. The lubricant is later 
expelled from the compression chamber by action of the 
rotors. A reservoir tank or receiver storage tank receives 
the compressed gas and lubricant expelled from the 
compression chamber. If the compressor is being used to supply air at a desired 
pressure, the compressor will operate until the air 
pressure in the reservoir reaches a desired level. This 
operation is referred to as a "loaded" condition. Once the 
air pressure in the reservoir has reached the desired 
pressure level, the opening of the gas inlet to the 
compressor is reduced or closed so that the amount of air 
compressed will be reduced. This operation is referred to 
as an "unloaded" condition. The compressor will operate in 
this manner until the air pressure in the reservoir falls 
below the desired pressure level, at which time the gas 
inlet is reopened and the compressor will operate in the 
"loaded" condition. Rotary screw-type compressor performance and efficiency may 
be maximised by performing one or more of the following 
actions: reducing oil supply temperature as much as  
 
possible to avoid pre-heating intake air; optimising oil 
lubricant flow at all combinations of rotor speeds, system 
pressure and load conditions; or by maintaining discharge 
temperature above dew point but below the maximum safe 
operating temperature for an oil lubricant to assure that 
condensation does not occur in the system. In present compressor designs, a minimum desired discharge 
temperature is achieved by use of a constant temperature 
thermal mixing valve and a fixed supply oil restriction. 
Maximum discharge temperature is controlled by using a 
sufficiently large cooler which is able to maintain a 
discharge temperature less than the maximum allowable in 
high ambient temperatures. However, these present designs 
are typically ineffective in increasing compressor 
efficiency because these compressor designs permit higher 
than optimum oil supply temperatures to ensure that no 
condensation forms in the system,

<CLAIMS>
A lubrication regulation system for use in combination 
with a compressed fluid system, the compressed fluid system 

including a compressor (10), a receiver (19) and a heat 
exchanger (25) which cools the lubricant, the compressor 

having an inlet (12) for low pressure gas to be compressed, 
an inlet (13) for lubricant and an outlet (14) through 

which a compressed gas and lubricant mixture is discharged; 
the lubrication regulation system comprising a controller 

(36), and valve means (30) for regulating the flow of 
lubricant to the compressor, wherein a first temperature 

sensor (33) measures a discharge temperature at the 
compressor outlet and provides a signal corresponding 

thereto to the controller, and a pressure sensor (34) 
measures the pressure at the outlet (14) of the compressor 

and provides a signal corresponding thereto to the 
controller, and wherein the controller continuously 

controls the valve means (30) in response to the first 
temperature signal to continuously, selectively regulate 

the supply of lubricant to the compressor; characterised in 
that, in response to the pressure signal, the controller 

regulates the flow of low pressure gas to the compressor, 
and the controller also controls the valve means in 

response to the pressure signal. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the compressor 
is a rotary screw-type compressor. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
controller is a microprocessor. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
further including a second temperature sensor (38) which 

measures a lubricant temperature at the lubricant inlet  
 

(13) of the compressor, and which provides a signal 

corresponding to the lubricant temperature to the 
controller. 
A system as claimed in claim 4, further 
including a heat exchanger (25) and a thermal mixing valve 

(26) which is disposed in signal receiving relation to the 
controller (36), and in response to the temperature signal 

provided by the second temperature sensor (38) to the 
controller, the controller controls the operation of the 

thermal mixing valve thereby continuously to regulate the 
temperature of the lubricant supplied to the compressor by 

controlling the amount of lubricant flowing through the 
heat exchanger, and regulation of the temperature of the 

lubricant minimises pre-heating the low pressure gas.
