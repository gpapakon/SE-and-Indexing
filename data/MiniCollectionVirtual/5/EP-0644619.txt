<ABSTRACT>
A connector includes a retainer for retaining 
metal terminals within a housing. The retainer includes 

provisional retaining projections and complete retaining 
projections. The retainer can be held on a housing in 

three depth positions. Namely, in the first insertion 
position (free position) of the retainer, the metal 

terminal is allowed to be inserted and withdrawn. In the 
second insertion position (provisional retained position), 

the provisional retaining portion engages the stabilizers 
to prevent the withdrawal of the metal terminal but allows 

the insertion of the metal terminal. In the third 
insertion position (complete retained position), the 

complete retaining projection is projected into and 
engaged in a retaining hole in the metal terminal, thereby 

preventing the withdrawal and insertion of the metal 
terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector of the type in
which double retaining is effected by a retainer, as well
to a method for assembling terminals within receiving holes
of such a connector's housing.Many conventional connectors adopt a so-called double
retaining construction for positively preventing withdrawal
of a metal terminal. In such a construction, as shown in
Fig. 5, an elastic piece 32 (called a lance) is formed
within a terminal receiving hole 31 formed in a connector
housing 30 (hereinafter "housing"). A metal terminal 33 is
resiliently retained by the lance (in a provisional retaining
condition shown in solid lines in Fig. 5), and a retainer
34 is fitted in the housing 30 to be engaged with a
jaw 35 of the metal terminal 33 (in a complete retaining
condition shown in phantom in Fig. 5). Thus, the metal terminal
33 is retained against withdrawal by two retainers.However, several problems are encountered in the above
conventional construction, because the lance 32 is formed
within the terminal receiving hole 31. Because the lance 32
is of a complicated shape and formed in the narrow terminal
receiving hole 31, the construction of the housing, as well
as the construction of a mold, inevitably becomes complicated.
Further, the internal space of the terminal receiving
hole 31 must be enough to accommodate the lance 32 and
also to allow the flexing of the lance 32, and accordingly
the housing 30 is increased in size.For withdrawing the metal terminal 33, the retainer 34
is first removed from the housing 30, and then the lance 32
is disengaged. In this case, a special tool is inserted
into the terminal receiving hole 31 from its open front
end, and the lance is forcibly flexed and deformed by the
tool. At this time, in some cases, the lance may be damaged
so that it can not be used again, and also the metal terminal 
33 may be damaged by the tool impinging on the metal terminal.Further, in the conventional construction, provisional retaining is effected by the
lance 32 whereas complete retaining is effected by the retainer 34. Thus, the different
kinds of retainers effect their respective withdrawal prevention operations at different
positions in the direction of the length of the metal terminal 33. Therefore, unless the
two positions are accurately determined, proper assembling cannot be carried out.
Therefore, in such a conventional construction, the tolerance of the respective
dimensions is required to be extremely high, thus resulting in prohibitively high
manufacturing costs.US-A-5 066 252
