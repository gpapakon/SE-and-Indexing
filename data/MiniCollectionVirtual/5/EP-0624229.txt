<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring device for observing the displacement volume setting of axial piston engines of any design, the displacement volumes of which can be adjusted to various values by means of a movable adjuster. The measuring device comprises a bearing surface coupled to the adjuster so that it can move therewith and a measuring sensor arrangement with at least one measuring sensor to detect changes in the position of the bearing surface, the measuring sensor and the bearing surface being each in mutual contact with a contact point. In order to be able with this measuring device to observe functions with different strokes as well, the invention proposes that, for the purposes of joint movement with the adjuster (1), the bearing surface (9) be rotatable about an axis (A) arranged at a distance from the contact point (22, 23; 26, 27; 34, 35). The angle of rotation ( alpha ) of the bearing surface (9) and the distance (x, r) determine the measuring travel (a, b) of the measuring sensor (7; 19; 30, 31) proportional to the movement of the adjuster (1).
