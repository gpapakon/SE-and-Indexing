<ABSTRACT>
The seat portion of a rearward facing child safety
seat has static rear part (12) and a movable front part

(34) which is movable between a deployed position in which
its upper surface is contiguous with that of the rear part

(35) and a stowed position leaving an opening (36) in front
of the rear part (35) for receiving the legs of an older

child (40) occupying the child seat with his knees (42)
bent and his feet (44) positioned below the level of the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child safety seat of
the type adapted to be positioned in a rearward facing
orientation on a vehicle seat and having a seat body and a
support member adapted to abut against the seat back of the
vehicle seat, the seat body comprising a seat portion and
a backrest. A child safety seat of this type is described
in EP-A-751035.Continued use of known seats of this type as a
child grows, is limited by abutment of the child's feet
against the vehicle seat back. One solution for this
problem is to increase the distance between the vehicle
seat back and the child seat body. However, this has the
disadvantage of reducing the distance between the child's
head and the structure of the vehicle in front of the
vehicle seat on which the child seat is positioned. In
addition, this has the result of increasing the length of
belt required when the child seat is secured to the vehicle
seat using the vehicle seat belt. A further disadvantage
is that parents may be tempted to alleviate the problem by
setting the child's seat in a more upright position. This
can be uncomfortable and, in extreme cases, risk damage to
the child's spine.According to the invention, in a child safety seat
of the type described above, the seat portion has a static
rear part and a movable front part which is movable between
a deployed position in which its upper surface is
contiguous with that of the rear part and a stowed position
leaving an opening in front of the rear part for receiving
the legs of an older child occupying the child seat with
his knees bent and his feet positioned below the level of
the static rear part.Embodiments of the invention will now be
described, by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is an elevational view of a child safety
seat in accordance with a first embodiment of the
invention, looking forwardly from the rear of the vehicle 
in which it is used, with the seat configured for use by a
young child;Figure 2 is a sectional view taken on the line 2-2
in Figure 2;Figure 3 is a perspective view of the seat shown
in Figure 1 with its movable panel in its deployed
position; Figure 4 is a sectional view on the line 2-2 but
with the movable panel in its stowed position, for use by
an older child;Figure 5 is an elevational view, similar to Figure
1, but with the movable panel in its stowed position;Figure 6 is a sectional view taken on the line 6-6
