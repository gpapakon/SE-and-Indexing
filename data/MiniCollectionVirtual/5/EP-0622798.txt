<ABSTRACT>
A signal equalizer (21-25) for equalizing a waveform of a digital 
data sequence includes a discriminator (23) for discriminating 

average measuement levels at plural frequencies of the 
digital data sequence, an error operating unit (35) for finding 

the ratio or difference between an equalizing target average 
level which correspond to the plural frequencies that has 

been found in advance and an average level obtained by the 
discriminator and a controller (24) for controlling an equalizing 

characteristic of the equalizer based on the error 
information obtained by the error operating unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
equalizer which performs a waveform equalization for a
digital data sequence reproduced from a digital data
record medium, such as, an optical disc and a magnetic
disc.A known apparatus for automatically equalizing
waveforms of signals reproduced from record medium, for
example optical discs, has been constructed, as shown
in Figure 1. Generally, in such record medium a
specified data pattern sequence, a so-called reference
signal or a training signal, is recorded on a
predetermined position thereof for use in the automatic
waveform equalization.Referring now to Figure 1, a reference signal is
searched for by a reference signal searcher 11. The
reference signal searched for by the reference signal
search section 11 is extracted by a reference signal
extractor 12, and then applied to an equalizer 13. The
equalizer 13 performs a waveform equalization for the
extracted reference signal and feeds the equalized
signal to an output terminal 14. The equalized signal
output from the equalizer 13 is also input to a
determining signal generator 15. The determining
signal generator 15 generates error information by
comparing the waveform or frequency spectrum of the
equalized signal from the equalizer 13 with a target
characteristic signal of the so-called reference signal
or training signal. This error information is input to
a logic controller 16. The logic controller 16
controls the equalizing characteristic of the equalizer
13 so as to make the waveform or frequency spectrum
characteristic of the equalizer 13 close to the target
characteristic signal based on the error information.
The logic controller 16 also controls reproducing
apparatus for the search of the reference signal. As described above, the known waveform
equalization system corrects the waveform equalization
characteristic based on error information by trial
reproduction of a predetermined reference signal and
then determining whether there is an error, i.e. a
difference from the target characteristic, or not.The known waveform equalization system is time
inefficient, because it needs extra time for
reproducing the recorded signal and then for searching
for reference signals from the reproduced signals.
Further, once having determined a waveform equalization
characteristic, the characteristic is maintained until
the reproduction of one disc terminates. It would be
better to modify the waveform equalization
characteristic according to the recording positions on
the disc. However, this known system could
