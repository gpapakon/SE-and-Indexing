The stator core (100) has a plurality of stator slots (101-116) which are distributed in the circumferential direction and are formed between poles (201-215), and a stator hole (117). First of all, one end plate (10) is fitted onto each of the two ends of the stator core (100), which end plate (10) consists of electrically insulating material and has a winding wire accommodation space (13) which is located radially and axially outside the stator slots (101-106), runs in the circumferential direction and is arranged in such a manner that a directly adjacent stator slot is at least partially left free, which directly adjacent stator slot is jumped over when the winding pattern which is to be wound is wound with a winding pitch of 
>
1. Furthermore, the end plate (10) has a radially projecting hold-back finger (12) between in each case two adjacent stator slots (101-106). After the end plates (10) have been fitted onto the respective end surfaces of the stator core (100), the winding wire (30) is laid under tension by means of a wire guide (1; 1') in such a manner that the wire guide (1; 1') is moved by means of a holding arm (2; 2') in at least two controlled axes and is possibly moved through the stator hole (117), the wire guide (1; 1') is rotated about an axis at right angles to its longitudinal axis in order to lay the winding wire (30) in the winding wire accommodation space (13) of the respective end plate (10), and the stator core (100) is moved onwards, through an appropriate step interval by the rotary holder (3) to the next stator slot (101-116) to be wound, and the winding wire (30) is guided by the associated hold-back finger (12) of the end plate (10). In addition, wire guides (1; 1') and end plates (10) which are suitable for the method are also specified for purpose.
