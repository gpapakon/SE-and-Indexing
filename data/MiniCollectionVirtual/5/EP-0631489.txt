A process for measuring vital fetal parameters during parturition, wherein the
blood pressure of the fetus is discontinuously measured in the arterial system by

carrying out the occlusion process by means of the pressure prevailing between the
annular uterine tissue (1) and the leading part of the fetus (2) and by means of a

pressure sensor (6) and a sensor (4) which senses the blood flow characteristics.
A process according to claim 1, wherein annular uterine tissue (1) is used as
an occlusion cuff with respect to the leading part of the child (2), the occlusion

pressure between the uterine tissue (1) and the leading part of the child (2) is
sensed by means of the pressure sensor (6), and the systolic and the diastolic

arterial blood pressure of the child (2) is determined during the subsiding of a
contraction by means of the sensor (4) recognizing the blood flow characteristics.
A process according to claim 1, wherein an elastic hollow ring (9) filled with a
fluid is diposed between the annular uterine tissue (1) and the leading part of the

fetus, which ring (9) will be inflated until the occlusion pressure has been reached,
the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure of the child is determined during the

release of the pressure in the hollow ring (9) by means of the pressure sensor (6)
and the sensor (4) recognizing the blood flow characteristics.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the fetal ECG is derived from
one of the sensors, e.g. from the sensor (4) sensing the blood flow characteristics or

from the pressure sensor (6). 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the fetal
hemoglobinometry, preferably the fetal pulse oximetry, and/or the CTG process

and/or the fetal ECG are carried out at the same time.
A device for carrying out the process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
device is suited for carrying out the occlusion process, by consisting of a sensor

(4) suited to be disposed on the leading part (2) of the fetus and sensing the blood
flow characteristics and of a pressure sensor (5, 6) suited to be disposed between

the uterine tissue (1) and the fetus.
A device according to claim 6, wherein the pressure sensor (5) consists of a
flexible tube (5) filled with fluid and closed at the front end, to whose rear end a

pressure sensor element is affixed.
A device according to claim 6, wherein the pressure sensor is designed as a
balloon catheter (6).
A device according to claim 6, wherein the pressure sensor is designed as a
clinically known, intrauterine pressure probe (7).
A device according to claims 6 and 9, wherein the pressure sensor is
designed as a double-lumen balloon catheter (8) detecting both the occlusion

pressure and simultaneously the intrauterine pressure.
A device for carrying out the process according to claim 1 or 3 wherein the
device is suited for carrying out the occlusion process, by consisting of a sensor

(4) suited to be disposed on the leading part (2) of the fetus and sensing the blood
flow characteristics, and of a pressure sensor suited to be disposed between the 

annular uterine tissue (1) and the leading part (2) of the fetus, said pressure sensor
being designed as an elastic, inflatable hollow ring (9) filled with fluid.
A device according to claim 11, wherein the hollow ring (9) is flattened on one
side to form a support surface (11) on the uterine tissue (1).
A device according to claim 12, wherein the flattened side (11) consists of a rigid
material.
A device according to claim 11, wherein the hollow ring (9) is disposed on an
elastic support ring (12) whose surface resting against the uterine tissue (1) is larger

than the surface of the hollow ring (9) which rests against the leading part of the
fetus.
A device according to claims 11, wherein the elastic hollow ring (9) and the
sensor (4) sensing the blood flow characteris
tics are fixed relative to each other as a
constructional unit.
A device for carrying out the process according to claim 6 or 11, wherein the
sensor (4) sensing the blood flow characteristics or the pressure sensor (5, 6) is

provided with electrical contacts for deriving the child's ECG.
