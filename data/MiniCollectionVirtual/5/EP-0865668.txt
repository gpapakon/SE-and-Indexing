<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a flip-chip process for producing a multi-chip module, in which a substrate (20), a multi-layer circuit (50, 60, 70), a component (15) and a heat sink (85) are combined according to the invention in such a way that solder or conductive adhesive is applied to the surface of the multi-layer circuit, e.g. by screen printing. It is now possible, as desired, to apply first a component (15) or a heat sink (85) thereon, whereupon the component and the heat sink are coated with a heat conducting adhesive and brought into thermal contact. This arrangement is covered by a plastic cap before being soldered or adhesively secured to a substrate with printed circuit tracks.
