<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power semiconductor
device, and more particularly to a power semiconductor device
having an insulated gate field effect transistor and a bipolar
transistor.In recent years, power semiconductor devices having
advantages to be easily driven and to be able to handle a large
current, i.e., power semiconductor devices equipped with the
features of both an insulated gate field effect transistor and
a bipolar transistor, have been used as power semiconductor
devices used for inverters and the like.As one of the above power semiconductor devices, Figs.
10(a) and 10(b) show an equivalent circuit of a semiconductor
device which is disclosed in EP-A-0 657 943 (not part of the prior art)
filed by the same inventors as the present ones. This
semiconductor device has major portions that are shown in a
cross-sectional view in Fig. 9, and is formed as shown in Figs.
8(a) to 8(d) and Fig. 9. Namely, as shown in Fig. 8(a), a
semiconductor substrate in which an n--type layer 3 is
epitaxially grown on a p+-type layer 2 is prepared.
Subsequently, to reduce resistance in a p-type layer 4b serving
as a base layer of second and third bipolar transistors
(hereafter referred to as Q4 and Q5) which are formed later, a
p+-type diffused layer 41 is formed in a region where the p-type 
layer 4b is to be formed, down to a depth which reaches a
vicinity of an interface between the p-type layer 4b and the n-
-type layer 3 by selectively injecting boron from the surface
of the n--type layer 3 and by allowing thermal diffusion to
take place.Then, as shown in Fig. 8(b), after an insulating film
and a gate electrode (polysilicon film) are formed one on top of
the other, the gate electrode is subjected to patterning,
thereby forming first and second electrodes 10 and 11 serving
as gate electrodes G1 and G2 of first and second insulated gate
field effect transistors (hereafter referred to as Q1 and Q2)
on the insulating film. Subsequently, by using the first and
second electrodes 10 and 11 as masks, the insulating film is
subjected to etching, thereby forming gate oxide films 9a and
9b beneath the first and second electrodes 10 and 11,
respectively. At this time, the first and second electrodes 10
and 11 are formed in such a manner that semiconductor regions
below the first and second electrodes 10 and 11 and ends which
cross the surfaces of the p+-type high-concentration layer 41
and a p+-type diffused layer 42 do not overlap with each other,
respectively. This is because if the concentration at surface
