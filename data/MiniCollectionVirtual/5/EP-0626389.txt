<ABSTRACT>
Recombinant, in particular humanised, e.g. humanised 
chimeric and CDR-grafted humanised, antibody molecules 

having specificity for human TNFα, are provided for use in 
diagnosis and therapy. In particular the antibody molecules 

have antigen binding sites derived from murine monoclonal 
antibodies CB0006, CB010, hTNF3 or 101.4. Preferred CDR-grafted 

humanised anti-hTNFα antibodies comprise variable 
region domains comprising human acceptor framework and donor 

antigen binding regions and wherein the frameworks comprise 
donor residues at specific positions. The antibody 

molecules may be used for therapeutic treatment of human 
patients suffering from or at risk of disorders associated 

with undesirably high levels of TNF, in particular for 
treatment of immunoregulatory and inflammatory disorders or 

of septic, endotoxic or cardiovascular shock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recombinant, in particular
humanised, antibody molecules having specificity for
antigenic determinants of tumour necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-α), to processes for their production using
recombinant DNA technology, and to their therapeutic uses.For the purposes of the present description the term
"recombinant antibody molecule" is used to describe an
antibody molecule produced by any process involving the
use of recombinant DNA technology, including any analogues
of natural immunoglobulins or their fragments.Also for the purposes of the present description the term
"humanised antibody molecule" is used to describe a
molecule having an antigen binding site derived from an
immunoglobulin from a non-human species, and remaining
immunoglobulin derived parts of the molecule being derived
from a human immunoglobulin. Thus humanised antibody
molecules include humanised chimeric antibody molecules
comprising complete non-human heavy and/or light chain
variable region domains linked to human constant region
domains. Humanised antibody molecules also comprise
CDR-grafted humanised antibody molecules comprising one or
more CDRs from a non-human antibody grafted into a heavy
and/or light chain human variable region framework.The antigen binding specificity of antibodies is
determined by their complementarily determining regions
(CDRs) which are relatively short peptide sequences
carried on the framework regions of the variable
domains. There are 3CDRs, (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) in each
of the heavy and light chain variable domains. The abbreviation "MAb" is used to indicate a monoclonal
antibody. In the present description reference is made
to a number of publications by number, and these
publications are listed in numerical order at the end of
the description.Natural immunoglobulins have been known for many years, as
have the various fragments thereof, such as the Fab, Fv,
(Fab')2 and Fc fragments, which can be derived by
enzymatic cleavage. Natural immunoglobulins comprise a
generally Y-shaped molecule having an antigen-binding site
towards the end of each upper arm. The remainder of the
structure, and particularly the stem of the Y, mediates
the effector functions associated with immunoglobulins.Natural immunoglobulins have been used in assay, diagnosis
and, to a more limited extent, therapy. However, such
uses, especially in therapy, were hindered until recently
by the polyclonal nature of natural immunoglobulins. A
significant step towards the realisation of the potential
of immunoglobulins
