<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions of tannin containing
polymers and methods of using the same for water clarification.Raw water such as water from rivers, lakes or underground usually
contains suspended matter. The suspended matter must be removed by
clarification in order to provide water suitable for use in domestic and
industrial applications. The suspended matter can consist of large solids,
settleable by gravity alone without any external aid, and nonsettleable
material, often colloidal in nature. Removal of the suspended material is
generally accomplished by coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation.
in combination, these processes are referred to as conventional clarification.
(see Betz Handbook of Industrial Water Conditioning, 9th Edition,
1991, Betz Laboratories, Inc., Trevose, PA, pages 23 through 30). Naturally occurring suspended particles are predominantly negatively
charged. Water-soluble organic cationic polymers, such as polyamine
and polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride, are normally used to
clarify water having high turbidity (greater than 60 NTU, nephelometric
turbidity units). In low turbidity water (less than 60 NTU), there are generally
not enough particulates to form a settleable floc when the water is
treated with cationic polymer alone. Inorganic coagulants such as aluminum
sulfate, polyaluminum chloride, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride and
sodium aluminate are used instead. These inorganic coagulants are
relatively inexpensive and generally effective for water clarification.
However, they tend to generate voluminous sludge which is difficult to
dewater. Also, such inorganic coagulants are only effective within a
particular pH range and therefore require proper pH adjustment of the
water during treatment. In addition, residual iron and aluminum ions in
the water treated may affect downstream operations such as cooling and
boiler treatments and may also cause health and environmental concerns
when the water is finally discharged.Water soluble/dispersible melamine formaldehyde resins have
been used for clarification of low turbidity waters, but the residual formaldehyde
in the resin can give rise to handling and disposal difficulties. It
is the object of the present invention to provide an effective method of
clarifying water without incurring the disadvantages of inorganic coagulants
and melamine formaldehyde resins. The present invention provides for a composition, the method of
preparing the same and a method of using the composition for water
clarification.
