<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a projection screen
for rear-projection television sets. In particular,
the present invention relates to a projection screen,
the configuration of which includes a horizontal
refracting linear Fresnel lens sheet and a vertical
refracting linear Fresnel lens sheet, wherein a ridge
line of said horizontal refracting linear Fresnel
lens sheet extends in said vertical direction and a
ridge line of said vertical refracting linear Fresnel
lens sheet extends in said horizontal direction.A projection screen for rear-projection TV sets
comprises a Fresnel lens unit for converging a
projection beam to the watching side and a lenticular
unit for dispersing the projection beam and forming a
picture. The Fresnel lens unit and the lenticular
unit can be formed into one or two sheets which are
referred to as a single-screen type and a double-screen
type respectively. Most of the home TV sets
are of the latter type.A circular Fresnel lens sheet comprises circular unit
lenses which are laid out on a plurality of planes in
such a way that their ridge lines form concentric
circles. Having such a configuration, the circular
Fresnel lens sheet produces an effect of converging
the projection beam to the watching side. The
lenticular lens sheet, on the other hand, comprises
linear unit lenses which are laid out on a plurality
of planes in such a way that their ridge lines are
parallel to each other. Having such a configuration,
the lenticular lens sheet produces an effect of
dispersing the projection beam and forming a picture.The projection screen described above, be it of the 
single-screen type or of the double-screen type, has
its Fresnel lenses formed into a concentric shape. A
metal pattern used for manufacturing concentric
Fresnel lens sheets is trimmed into a rotary disc.A circular Fresnel lens is manufactured by using a
plane forming pattern, the metal pattern trimmed into
a rotary disc cited above. The circular Fresnel
lens is fabricated by adopting methods such as a
'press technique' a 'cast technique' and a 'UV'
technique. In the press technique, a transparent
resin plane is pressed against a heated metal
pattern. In the cast technique, transparent resin
undergoes thermal polymerization inside a metal-pattern
cell. In the UV technique, a metal pattern
is coated with ultraviolet-ray hardened resin and a
transparent resin plane is then placed as a cover on
the ultraviolet-ray hardened resin. Finally, an
ultraviolet ray is applied thereto for hardening the
resin.In either method,
