<DESCRIPTION>
A related invention is disclosed in EP 91 115 474.8 (not 
published at the filing date of this application), which 
claims priority from US Patent Application 07/583,867. This invention relates to an apparatus for 
applying surgical fasteners along an arcuate path in bodily 
areas otherwise difficult to reach with straight line 
fastener apparatus. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a fastener applying apparatus having an improved 
arcuately configured fastener cartridge and holder for the 
retainer portion of two-part surgical fasteners. In some surgical operations it is necessary to 
fasten body tissue or to adjoin two hollow body organs 
alongside each other, with their longitudinal axes 
positioned generally parallel to each other, and to effect a 
longitudinal cut through the contacting circumferential 
walls of the two organs in order to open them to each other. 
After joining the two organs they essentially constitute a 
single hollow chamber along the length of the cut. 
Correspondingly, the circumferential portions of the two 
adjoining organs on each lateral side of the cut must be 
sutured by at least one line of "stitches" in order to 
maintain the integrity of the union.  Instruments for this purpose are known in the art, 
and are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,079,606, 3,490,675 
and 3,499,591. Such instruments are generally referred to 
as linear cutting staplers and include two elongate fingers 
which are respectively insertable into the tissue or into 
each organ from an open end thereof such that the two 
fingers have the adjoining walls of the adjacent organs 
therebetween. Further examples of such instruments are 
disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,429,695 
and 4,520,817. The disclosures of these two last mentioned 
patents are incorporated herein by reference. One of the fingers includes a disposable cartridge 
carrying a plurality of staples arranged in at least two 
lateral rows while the other finger includes an anvil for 
curling the staple legs into hook form upon being driven 
against the anvil. The stapling operation is effected by a 
pusher device which travels longitudinally along the 
cartridge carrying finger extending into one organ. The 
pusher mechanism acts simultaneously upon the staples at 
corresponding longitudinal positions in each lateral row, 
but successively acts upon the staples along the rows. For 
example, if two laterals rows of staples are provided, each 
row comprising twenty staples, the pusher means acts upon 
two staples at

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for applying a plurality of fasteners 
to body tissue by manually operable advancement 

means (38), characterized by a manually operable 
member (40) insertable into a first side of said 

advancement means whereby said member is removable 
from said first side and insertable into a second 

side of said advancement means so as to facilitate 
manual operation on each of at least two sides. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
advancement means comprises a cam bar retainer (38). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said member (40) includes a connecting stem (42) 

attached thereto and insertable into said 
advancement means (38). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the advancement means defines an 

aperture (42a) to receive the manually operable 
member, and wherein the aperture (42a) can receive 

the manually operable member from either the first 

side or the second side. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said fasteners are deformable 

staples adapted to be applied to body tissue and to 
be advanced into engagement with staple deforming 

means. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 4, wherein said fasteners are two-part fasteners, 

a first fastener portion (22, 26) and a second 
retainer portion (52, 54) adapted to become 

engagably attached to said fastener portion. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, including 
retainer mounting elements (56, 58) which release 

their respective retainer portions (52, 54) in 
response to the engagement of the fastener portions 

(22, 26) with their respective retainer portions 
(52, 54). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein said 
retainer mounting elements (56, 58) each comprise a 

base portion and at least one upright post (72, 74) 
for engaging an aperture (76, 78) in said retainer 

portion (52, 54) and frictionally holding said 
retainer portion. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, adapted to fasten body tissue and further 

comprising means (35) to cut the body tissue 
adjacent the location of application of said 

fasteners. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 9, for applying at 
least two rows of two-part surgical fasteners to 

body tissue and for cutting the body tissue, each 
said surgical fastener having at least two pronged

said fastener portions; 
c) a retainer carrying cartridge (47) having an 
arcuate configuration similar to the other of said 

elongated finger portions and mounted along said 
other finger portion opposite said fastener 

cartridge and carrying a plurality of said retainer 
members (52, 54) positioned opposite said fastener
