<ABSTRACT>
A business record such as a form, tag, label or the like is 
provided in which different selected colored areas may be 

activated in a single pass through a printer. In one embodiment, 
coatings of initially colorless color formers and color 

developers are coated on selected areas of a substrate surface. 
The color formers and color developers combine upon exposure to 

an imaging force, such as heat or pressure, to form different 
colored visible areas on the sheet. In an alternative 

embodiment, the coatings of color formers and color developers 
are self-contained coatings having pressure-rupturable 

microcapsules containing either the color formers or said color 
developers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a business record, such as a form,
label, tag, or the like, in which different selected areas may be
activated thermally More
particularly, the invention relates to a sheet containing on its
surface coatings of selected initially colorless color formers
and color developers which, when subjected to heat,
combine to form different colored areas on the sheet.In the design and use of business forms, labels, tags, and
the like, it is desirable to present information in an organized
fashion so that information may be readily assimilated. For
example, forms typically use headings or columns to identify
different categories of information. Lines, rules, and screened
areas are also used to delineate specific areas of information.Color has also been used on business forms to delineate or
differentiate information. For example, multipart forms, with
each part being printed on different colored paper, have been in
use for many years. The different color of each part of the form
designates to whom that part is to be given or sent. Others have
used different colored forms, labels, or tags to designate, for
example, different methods of shipment of packages. As with
multi-part forms, however, this method of designation requires
that the user maintain an inventory of each different colored
form, label, or tag.To better differentiate categories of information,
preprinted screened background areas are often printed in
selected colors. One known method used for producing different
colors is to apply colored inks during the printing process when
the forms are being manufactured. However, such a process
requires a separate printing station for each color of ink used.
In addition, if the techniques of process color are used,
different shades or hues of color can only be produced by 
printing two or more colors in a superimposed relationship
onto selected areas of the form.EP-A-343780 teaches a carbonless copy system and a method of
producing multiple coloured copy images. The system includes a
recording substrate (copy) and a transfer substrate (original),
between which are sandwiched two or three image-forming components.
The image-forming components may contain different colourless dye
precursors encapsulated in microcapsules, such that impact on the
transfer substrate will rupture the capsules to leave a coloured
mark on the recording substrate. The image-forming components are
arranged in a manner so that impact in one area will rupture the
microcapsules in one component and provide a record in

<CLAIMS>
An imagable business record (10) in which one or more different
selected areas may be activated by heat to form colored images or

areas comprising:

   a substrate having first and second major surfaces, said first
surface of said substrate including on one or more selected portions

thereof a thermally imagable coating of initially colorless color
formers and color developers, with the remaining areas of said

substrate not containing said thermally imagable coating.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said color
formers and color developers combin
e to form colored visible areas
which include images, symbols, or indicia.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein only one
selected colored area is activated.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein the outer
peripheral area (12) of said substrate is coated with a color former

and color developer which form a first color, a middle peripheral
area (14) adjacent said outer peripheral area is coated with a color

developer and color former which form a second color, and an inner
peripheral area (16) adjacent said middle peripheral area is coated

with a color former and color developer which form a third color.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
substrate includes a plurality of columns (20), (22), (24), wherein

each of said columns is coated with a color former and color
developer which form a different selected color.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 comprising a
continuous web (38) for producing a series of imagable business

records.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein at least
one selected area of said first surface of said substrate has been

pre-coated to provide a smooth and non-porous base coat for said
thermally imagable coating. 
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 including a
protective coating over said thermally imagable coating, wherein

said protective coating is selected from the group consisting of
electron beam cured polymers, cross-linked water-based polymers, and

ultraviolet radiation cured polymers and photocatalyst.
A business record (10) as claimed in claim 1 comprising a
series of labels on said substrate, wherein said second surface of

said substrate is coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive and a
release liner is adhered to said pressure sensitive adhesive.
A process for producing an imagable business record comprising
the steps of:


a) providing a substrate having first and second major
surfaces;
b) printing fixed or variable indicia on at least one surface
of said substrate; and
c) printing a thermally imagable coating composition on one or
more selected portions of said first surface of said substrate

comprising initially colourless colour formers and colour
developers, with the remaining areas of said substrate not

containing said thermally imagable coating.
The process as claimed in claim 10 wherein said substrate is a
continuous web.
The process as claimed in claim 11 including the step of die-cutting
said web to form a series of individual business records.
The process as claimed in claim 12 including the steps of
perforating and folding said individual business records.
An imagable business record (10) in which one or more different
selected areas may be activated by heat to form coloured images or

   a substrate having first and second major surfaces, said first
surface of said substrate including on selected portions thereof
