<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for the 
production of composite ultrafine particles, and more 
particularly to a method and apparatus for the production of 
composite ultrafine particles by the deposition of various 
materials on ultrafine particles of a varying substance. Heretofore, ultrafine particles have been manufactured by 
vaporizing a matrix as by means of resistance heating, arc 
melting, plasma heating, etc. To treat the surfaces of these 
ultrafine particles, the practice of heating these ultrafine 
particles and meanwhile exposing them to the flow of such a 
gas as N₂ or CH₄ thereby nitriding or carbonizing the surfaces 
or interiors of the ultrafine particles has been adopted. Within the inventors' knowledge, however, no idea of 
coating the surfaces of ultrafine particles with various 
metallic or ceramic materials has ever been introduced to the 
art. The idea of producing composite ultrafine particles by 
coating the surfaces of ultrafine particles with a varying 
metallic or ceramic material is expected to allow development  
 
and manufacture of new materials which are endowed with various 
useful properties dependent on the kind of a substance forming 
the ultrafine particles to be coated and the kind of a metallic 
or ceramic coating material to coat the surfaces of the 
ultrafine particles. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a method and apparatus for permitting efficient 
production of such composite ultrafine particles with a 
comparatively simple construction thereby allowing development 
and manufacture of novel materials endowed with various useful 
properties. To accomplish the object described above, the present 
invention provides a method for the production of composite 
ultrafine particles by the steps of thermally melting an 
evaporation source of ultrafine particles in a gaseous 
atmosphere in a chamber for the generation of ultrafine 
particles thereby generating ultrafine particles, introducing 
the consequently generated ultrafine particles into a chamber 
for the deposition of ultrafine particles by virtue of a 
pressure difference between the chamber for the generation of 
ultrafine particles and the chamber for the deposition of 
ultrafine particles, and thermally vaporizing an evaporation 
source of particles for deposition in the chamber for the 
deposition of ultrafine particles thereby generating particles 
for deposition therein and allowing the particles for 
deposition to coat the introduced ultrafine
