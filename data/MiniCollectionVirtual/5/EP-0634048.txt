<CLAIMS>
Gas-insulated switchgear having a gas-filled 
container (2) and a multipole vacuum switch (3) 

arranged in the container (2) with its vacuum 
interrupters (12) in a horizontal position, and having 

a multipole three-position load-break switch (5) 
arranged beneath the vacuum switch (3) and at right-angles 

thereto and with its switch shaft (41) in a 
horizontal position, and having a drive device (4, 6) 

arranged on a front wall (13) of the container (2) for 
the vacuum switch (3) and for the load-break switch 

(5), furthermore having outgoing bushings (7) arranged 
on the front wall (13) beneath the load-break switch 

(5), characterised in that the vacuum interrupters (12) 
are arranged with their longitudinal axes aligned at 

right-angles to the front wall (13) of the container 
(2), and in that the load-break switch (5) is arranged 

with its axis of rotation likewise horizontal, yet 
aligned parallel with the front wall (13) of the 

container (2). 
Gas-insulated switchgear according to claim 
1, characterised in that the load-break switch (5) can 

be actuated by means of an inner twist handle (47) 
which cooperates with the switch shaft (41) of the 

load-break switch (5) and which has a forked opening 
(46) at the end facing towards the front wall (13) of 

the container (2), for engaging an outer twist handle 
(44) sealed in a gas-tight manner relative to the front 

wall (13).
