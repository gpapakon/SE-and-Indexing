<ABSTRACT>
A reconstituted human antibody against a human interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), which is composed of: (A) an L chain 

composed of (1) the C region of a human L chain and (2) the V region of an L chain comprising the framework region (FR) of a 
human L chain and the complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the L chain of a mouse monoclonal antibody against a human 

IL-6R, and (B) an H chain composed of (1) the C region of a human H chain and (2) the V region of an H chain comprising 
the FR of a human H chain and the CDR of the H chain of a mouse monoclonal antibody against a human IL-6R. Since most of 

the reconstituted human antibody originates in human antibodies and the CDR is lowly antigenic, this antibody is lowly antigenic 
against human and hence prospective as a therapeutic agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to variable regions (V
region) of a mouse monoclonal antibody to the human
interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), human/mouse chimeric
antibody to the human IL-6R, and reshaped human antibody
comprising a human antibody wherein the complementarity
determining regions (CDRs) of the human light chain (L
chain) V region and of the human heavy chain (H chain)
V region are grafted with the CDRs of a mouse monoclonal
antibody to the human IL-6R. Moreover, the present
invention provides DNA coding for the above-mentioned
antibodies or part thereof. The present invention
further provides vectors, especially expression vectors
comprising said DNA, and host cells transformed or
transfected with said vector. The present invention
still more provides a process for production of a
chimeric antibody to the human IL-6R, and process for
production of a reshaped human antibody to the human IL-6R.Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multi-function cytokine
that is produced by a range of cells. It regulates
immune responses, acute phase reactions, and
hematopoiesis, and may play a central role in host
defense mechanisms. It acts on a wide range of tissues,
exerting growth-inducing, growth inhibitory, and
differentiation-inducing effects, depending on the nature
of the target cells. The specific receptor for IL-6
(IL-6R) is expressed on lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid
cells in accordance with the multifunctional properties
of IL-6. Abnormal expression of the IL-6 gene has been
suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety
of diseases, especially autoimmune diseases, mesangial 
proliferative glomerulonephritis, and
plasmacytoma/myeloma (see review by Hirano et al.,
Immunol. Today 11, 443-449, 1990). Human myeloma cells
are observed to produce IL-6 and express IL-6R. In
experiments, antibody against IL-6 inhibited the in vitro
growth of myeloma cells thus indicating that an autocrine
regulatory loop is operating in oncogenesis of human
myelomas (Kawano et al., Nature, 332, 83, 1988).The IL-6R is present on the surface of various
animal cells, and specifically binds to IL-6, and the
number of IL-6R molecules on the cell surface has been
reported (Taga et al., J. Exp. Med. 196, 967, 1987).
Further, cDNA coding for a human IL-6R was cloned and a
primary structure of the IL-6R was reported (Yamasaki et
al., Science, 241, 825, 1988).Mouse antibodies are highly immunogenic in humans
and, for this reason, their therapeutic value in humans
is limited. The half-life of mouse antibodies in vivo in
human is
