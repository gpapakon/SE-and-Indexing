<ABSTRACT>
A new kind of reusable transport container for a logistic system, appropriate in particular for the retail trade and for self-service shop chains, allows the contents of the container to be directly unloaded from the transport container and set on the shop shelves. No valuable shelving surface is taken by stored parts of the container. For that purpose, the bottom plate (12) of the disclosed foldable transport container (30) can be completely drawn out; the goods to be sold can thus be deposited all together for example on a thin tray. The container is lifted off and the goods to be sold are directly stored on the shop shelves. The folded empty transport container is immediately returned to the supplier for a new delivery of goods.

<CLAIMS>
A re-usable transport container (10, 30) of thermoplastic plastics material, which can be 
carried manually by an operator, in the form of a closed, collapsible or foldable box 

(rectangular design) with an upper cover (38, 49; 50, 52) divided in half and with a lower 
frame part (14) which extends continuously on the base plate (12) and to which at least 

two opposed side walls (36) are articulated, 
characterized in that
 the base plate (12) is 
constructed as a separate component and is slidably displaceable in the frame part (14) 

and completely withdrawable, wherein the base plate (12) is provided with a gripping 
strip (22) in the form of a flanged edge on the side opposite the initially insertable transverse 

edge (20). 
A transport container according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 two opposite rails or 
longitudinal grooves (16), between which the base plate (12) is slidably displaceable by 

means of the corresponding outer edges (18) thereof, are arranged on the inside of the 
frame part (14). 
A transport container according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the frame part (14) is 
provided on the outside with two rails or longitudinal grooves (24) on two opposite sides, 

and one respective L-shaped flanged edge (26) is arranged on each of the corresponding 
outer edges (18) on the base plate (12), wherein an inwardly directed arm of the 

L-shaped flanged edge (26) engages over the respective rail and into the longitudinal 
groove (24) and the base plate (12) is thus slidably displaceable. 
A transport container according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the transverse 
edge to be inserted first or the front transverse edge (20) of the base plate (12) is 

chamfered or flattened. 
A transport container according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the withdrawable 
base plate (12) can be locked by means of actuable locking means or releasable 

fastening means, such as for example catching cams, ratchets, spring-loaded pins or the 
like, so as to prevent it from inadvertently slipping out of the frame part (14). 
A transport container according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the withdrawable 
base plate (12) and/or the upper container cover can be closed off or sealed by 

means of suitable sealing means, such as for example sealing spreading pins (28),  
 

adhesive sealing tape or the like, to prevented unauthorized opening. 
A transport container according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the underside 
of the frame part (14) is provided with at least one recess, such as for example a 

transversely extending groove or bores, into which corresponding projections, such as for 
example a narrow upright flanged edge (catching rail) or catching cams (engagement 

pins) of a thin tray (support tablet) positioned thereunder, can engage with positive 
locking in order to fix longitudinally and transversely the transport container (10) placed 

thereon.
