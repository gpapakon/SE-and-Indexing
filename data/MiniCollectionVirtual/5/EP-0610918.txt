Apparatus for measuring the transit time of light waves 
over a measurement path (13) of predetermined length 

comprising a transmitter (32) controlled by an electrical 
pulse generator (11) which transmits the electrical 

wave in the form of wave pulses over the measurement 
path (13) and with a measurement receiver (15) provided 

at the end of the measurement path (13) which receives 
the wave pulses and converts them into an electrical 

received pulse, wherein the pulse generator (11) which 
can be triggered by one pulse flank and a light modulator 

(31) acted on by the pulse generator (11) are arranged 
in a feedback loop (12) extending between the 

output (17) of the light modulator (31) and the trigger 
input (18), wherein the feedback loop has a received 

pulse time determination circuit (34, 35, 36, 37, 39) 
before the pulse generator (11) into which either the 

measurement path (13) or a reference path (14) having a 
reference receiver (16) at the end can be alternately 

incorporated for a measurement time interval (T1) and 
for a reference time interval (T2) respectively which 

are both large relative to the pulse repetition time, 
and wherein a computing counting stage (19) counts the 

circuits of the wave pulse in the feedback loop (12) 
and also computes the transit time from the length of 

the measurement time interval and from the length of 
the reference time interval and the number of pulses 

transmitted during them, characterised in that the 
pulse generator (11) transmits, each time it is triggered, 

a short sequence of pulses (9, 10) of the same 
length and the same amplitude, wherein the spacing between 

two sequential transmitted pulses is the same 
apart from the spacing of the last pulse (10) from the  

 
penultimate pulse and wherein the last pulse (10) has 

an additional phase shift of 180° relative to the 
penultimate one; in that the pulse reception time 

determination circuit includes a resonator (35) tuned 
to the frequency of the pulse group (8) of sequential, 

equally spaced pulses (9) present before the pulse (10) 
additionally phase-shifted by 180° and thereafter a detector 

circuit (36, 37, 38, 39) at the resonator (35) 
which, as a result of the sudden collapse of the resonator 

oscillation (7) excited by the pulse group (8), 
defines the time of the directly preceding zero passage 

as the time of reception of the short sequence of 
pulses (9, 10) from which the triggering of the next 

short sequence of pulses (9, 10) takes place, after a 
predetermined refresh time. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterised in 
that the detector circuit has a zero passage detector 

(36) and an envelope curve detector (37) connected in 
parallel to the latter, to the inputs of which the 

output of the resonator (35) is applied and the outputs 
of which are applied to the setting input (S) and the 

resetting input (R) respectively of a pretrigger (38) 
in such a way, that after the collapse of the resonator 

oscillation (7) excited by the pulse group (8) only the 
directly preceding zero passage of the resonator 

oscillation sets the pretrigger (38), the next maximum 
of the resonator oscillation can
 however no longer reset 
the pretrigger (38). 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 2, characterised in 
that the envelope curve detector (37) only then transmits 

a resetting signal when the resonator oscillation 
exceeds a predetermined fraction of the maximum of the 

envelope curve (6) of the resonator oscillation (7)  
 

preceding a cycle and in that the threshold formation 
required for this takes place by means of counting of 

the envelope curve pulses. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a refresh time circuit 

(39) is provided adjoining the pretrigger (38) which 
delays the transmission of a counting trigger pulse to 

the pulse generator (11) and to the computing counting 
stage (19) by a fixed regeneration time. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the fixed refresh time or 

regeneration time amounts to 2 to 200 ns, preferably 20 
to 100 ns and in particular to two oscillation periods 

of the resonant frequency. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that from 3 to 10, preferably 

from 5 to 9 and in particular 8 equally spaced pulses 
(9) are provided before the last pulse (10) which is 

additionally phase-shifted by 180°. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that an amplitude limiter (34) 

is arranged before the resonator (35). 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the limiter (34), the 

zero passage detector (36), the envelope curve detector 
(37), the pretrigger (38), the refresh time circuit 

(39) and the pulse generator (11) are formed on a single 
semiconductor component chip.  

 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the computing counting 

stage (19) includes a forward-rearward counter at which 
the measurement time is first clocked in in one counting 

direction and the reference time is then clocked 
out in the opposite counting direction. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the refresh time or regeneration 

time (T) is selected to be sufficiently long 
that before the appearance of the trigger pulse flank 

(2) the associated transmission process in the pulse 
generator (11) has completely died away. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 3, characterised in 
that the predetermined fraction exceeds 1/√2 times the 

maximum of the envelope curve (6) of the resonator oscillation 
preceding a cycle. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 3, characterised in 
that the threshold formation takes place through a 

digital three-point regulation by means of counting of 
the envelope curve pulses.
