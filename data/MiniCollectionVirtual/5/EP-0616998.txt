<ABSTRACT>
Contaminated acrylic acid is purified by means of fractional static and dynamic crystallisation. This allows the yield of acrylic acid to be increased considerably, and the amount of residue to be disposed of is reduced.

A method of purifying acrylic acid by fractional 
crystallisation, characterised in that acrylic acid is 

purified in a number of stages in crystallisation/melting 
cycles by a combination of dynamic and static 

crystallisation, the residue from dynamic crystallisation 
being further purified by static crystallisation and the 

resulting acrylic acid being returned to dynamic 
crystallisation, the crystallised material from the 

highest stage of dynamic crystallisation leaving the 
purification process in the form of pure product. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
acrylic acid containing up to 20%, preferably up to 10% by 

weight of impurities is supplied to a dynamic 
crystallisation stage and the acrylic acid is purified in 

two or more stages in a dynamic crystalliser, the 
impurities in the residue are concentrated in the lowest 

stage of dynamic crystallisation to about 30%, preferably 
10% to 25%, the residue serving as a feed for static 

crystallisation, in which the residue is purified in at 
least one stage, whereby the impurities in the residue 

leaving the purification process can be concentrated to 
about 50% by weight, and the crystallised material 

obtained from the highest stage of static crystallisation 
is returned to dynamic crystallisation. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the residue in dynamic crystallisation and the partial 

melt from a given stage are each additionally purified in 
a lower stage of dynamic crystallisation in a subsequent 

sequence, and the partial melt from the lowest stage of 
dynamic crystallisation is re-purified in the same stage.  

 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the static and dynamic crystallisation occur 

simultaneously side by side. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the partial melt from the highest stage of static 

crystallisation is divided into two parts, the first part 
being purified in the next lower stage and the second part 

in the same stage of a subsequent sequence. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that in the static crystallisation, the heat transfer 

medium in the crystallisation phase is left at the 
starting temperature of 0 to -15°C for about 1 hour and 

then cooled to the final temperature of -30 to -15°C for 5 
to 6 hours. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that in the highest stage of dynamic crystallisation, 

only the crystallised material from the previous stage is 
used. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the acrylic acid is purified by static 

crystallisation in two stages. 
A method according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
partial melt from the first stage is purified in the first 

stage of a subsequent sequence and the corresponding 
crystallised material is purified in the second stage 

thereof.  
 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the dynamic crystallisation is of the falling-film 

or fully flowed-through tube type. 
A method according to claim 10, characterised in that in 
order to obtain purity above 99.9%, the acrylic acid is 

purified by dynamic crystallisation in five stages. 
A method according to any of claims 7 to 11, characterised 
in that no new material is added in at least one 

additional stage of dynamic crystallisation, i.e. the 
stage is operated as a half-stage. 
A method of purifying acrylic acid by fractional 
crystallisation, characterised in that acrylic acid is 

purified by a combination of suspension crystallisation 
and static crystallisation in a number of stages in 

crystallisation/melting cycles, the residue from 
suspension crystallisation being further purified by 

static crystallisation and the resulting acrylic acid 
being returned to suspension crystallisation, the 

crystallised material from the highest stage of suspension 
crystallisation leaving the purification process in the 

form of pure product. 
A method according to claim 13, characterised in that 
acrylic acid containing up to 20%, preferably up to about 

10% by weight of impurities is supplied to a suspension 
crystallisation stage and the acrylic acid is purified in 

one or more stages, the impurities in the residue are 
concentrated in the lowest stage of suspension 

crystallisation to about 30%, preferably 10 to 25%, the 
residue serving as a feed for static crystallisation, in 

which the residue is purified in at least one stage  
 

whereby the impurities in the residue leaving the 
purification process can be concentrated to about 50% by 

weight and the crystallised material obtained from the 
highest stage of static crystallisation is returned to 

dynamic crystallisation. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 14, characterised 
in that in the dynamic crystallisation process the heat 

transfer medium, depending on the purity of the melt, is 
cooled from about 5 to -5°C to about -10 to -25°C during 

the crystallisation phase and heated to about 18°C during 
the sweating phase. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 15, characterised 
in that after the crystal layer formed on the cooling 

surfaces of the static crystalliser has melted and after 
the melt has been discharged into a tank, the crystalliser 

is cooled and the melt still adhering to the cooling 
surfaces is crystallised out to form a stable crystal 

layer before the crystalliser is filled with a new batch. 
Apparatus for purifying acrylic acid by fractional 
crystallisation, characterised by at least one static 

crystalliser and one dynamic crystalliser connected in 
series, the static crystalliser being provided for 

purifying the residue from dynamic crystallisation, and 
also characterised by tanks for intermediate storage of 

acrylic acid fractions, and pumps and pipes for conveying 
the acrylic acid from the tanks to the crystallisers and 

vice versa. 
Apparatus according to claim 17, characterised in that a 
static crystalliser, a dynamic crystalliser of the 

falling-film or fully flowed-through tube type and five or

static crystalliser, a suspension crystalliser and at 

least four tanks for intermediate storage of acrylic acid 
are provided.
