<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system (10) for controlling and/or 
recording and/or indicating of elapsed time and/or of events 

following one another in the time. The system (10) comprises a 
unit (10) suitable for receiving and recording data coming from a 

first suitable carrier (12), for processing said data and for 
presenting them in a displayed and/or recorded form on a second 

suitable carrier (16), said unit (10) comprising at least one 
reading device (14, 15) for reading the data recorded on said first 

carrier (12), a clock circuit giving a signal of elapsed time. 
According to the invention, the system comprises an electronic 

circuit suitable for processing the data detected on said first 
carrier, for associating them to the signals coming from said clock 

circuit and to record them on said second carrier (16), and in that 
said unit (10) is completely autonomous and fed by a suitable 

battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for controlling 
and/or recording and/or indicating of elapsed time and/or of 
events following one another in the time. More particularly, the present invention relates to an 
admittance control system which is able to confidentially store in 
a memory the displacements and/or the passages of persons 
within a given place or a given area. In some places, e.g. building yards, hotels, supermarkets, 
joinery workshops etc., it is necessary to have an admittance 
control system which is able to confidentially record the 
displacements and/or the passages of persons, so that 
the situation of the presences within said place is continuously 
available. A system which is normally used in a plurality of working 
places is constituted by the so-called "presence booklets", which 
are manually filled out and which allow the presences of 
operators to be checked. However, such system involves disadvantages and 
drawbacks, since it causes data writing and/or transcription 
errors, and it causes a large waste of time and work to the 
presence checking operators (especially in the case where the 
staff is numerous); furthermore, the data may easily be modified 
by persons who do not act in a real good faith. Thus, such system may not be considered as reliable. Another known presence control system, which is for 
instance used in building yards, makes use of a magnetic card 
which is associated to each operator, and of suitable computing 
means (e.g. a PC) which are installed by the yard and which may 
elaborate, for instance, the entry and exit data or the working 
time of a given person who would insert said magnetic card in a  
 
suitable reading device. Such system is certainly more advantageous in respect of 
the system making use of presence booklets; however, it also 
involves disadvantages and drawbacks which greatly limit the 
possibilities of using this system. In fact it requires the presence, for each individual yard, of 
a fixed PC suitable for processing the data, of specific PC 
operators, and of a magnetic card reading device; on these 
grounds, such system is relatively little used, since it does not 
allow any flexibility of use; as a matter of fact, this system may 
only be individually used for a single yard, and it requires the 
installation of a specific PC for each individual yard. This substantial irremovability causes, from an economical 
point of view, very high costs in order to check, for instance, the 
presence of a working team acting in different
