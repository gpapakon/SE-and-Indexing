<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for recording and reproducing a tape-shaped 
recording medium, which is capable of minimizing the 

effect of adsorbed water present at the interface between 
the tape and a sliding member and hence enables the tape to 

travel stably without sticking to the sliding member even 
under conditions close to moisture condensational 

conditions. An aluminum alloy is employed as a material for 
a sliding member such as a fixed drum, stationary tape 

guides, etc. on which a video tape slides, and a large 
number of projections are formed on the surface of the 

sliding member. A material of high water repellency is 
formed on the surface of the sliding member for the purpose 

of minimizing the effect of contact portions formed by the 
video tape and the projections of the sliding member and the 

effect of bonded portions of adsorbed water produced around 
the contact portions (at the interface). More specifically, 

the surface of the sliding member is formed with an 
electrolessly plated nickel film containing 

polytetrafluoroethylene particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
recording and reproducing an information signal on and from
a tape-shaped recording medium such as a video tape, an
audio tape, etc. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an arrangement of a sliding member provided in a
tape-shaped recording medium recording and reproducing
apparatus so that a tape-shaped recording medium slides in
contact with the sliding member.A conventional apparatus for recording and reproducing
an information signal on and from a tape-shaped recording
medium such as a video tape, an audio tape, etc., for
example, a video tape recorder, is arranged as shown in
Fig. 8. That is, a cylindrical rotary drum, which is
equipped with video heads, is installed at a predetermined
angle of inclination to a chassis board so as to record an
information signal along linear tracks on a video tape by
helical scanning.In general, a plurality of tape guides and a pair of
slant guide posts are provided around the rotary drum and a
fixed drum for the purpose of accurately guiding a video 
tape to the lead of the fixed drum.Recording and reproduction of an information signal
with respect to a video tape are effected by traveling of
the video tape along the lead of the fixed drum which is
caused by rotation of a take-up reel (and a supply reel) and
the rotary drum.During the traveling, the video tape slides in contact
with the surfaces of the stationary tape guides and the lead
surface of the fixed drum, so that the video tape is
subjected to frictional force produced by the contact
sliding. When the frictional force caused by the contact
sliding increases, the video tape cannot smoothly travel.
As a result, the video tape may cause jamming. In the worst
case, the video tape may be damaged.Therefore, the conventional practice is to employ an
aluminum alloy as a material for a sliding member 1, such as
the fixed drum, stationary tape guides, etc., on which a
video tape T slides, as shown in Fig. 5. Further, a large
number of projections 1a are formed on the surface of the
sliding member 1 to provide a configuration that reduces the
area of contact with the video tape T, thereby minimizing
frictional force produced between the video tape T and a
part (sliding member 1) on which the video tape T slides.However, in the conventional studies on the friction of
the sliding member 1, notice has been taken of only the 
damage given to the tape T and how the coefficient of
friction varies according to the number of times of sliding
performed by the
