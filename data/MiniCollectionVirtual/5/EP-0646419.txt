<ABSTRACT>
A work is applied with a solvent-containing 
thermosetting coating composition to a thickness larger 

than a limit thickness over which the coating composition 
on a surface of the work extending in a vertical 

direction will normally run or sag in a coating zone. 
After applied with the coating composition, the work is 

rotated about a substantially horizontal axis to prevent 
the coating composition on the vertical surface of the 

work from running or sagging and is conveyed through a 
heat-hardening zone for hardening the coating composition 

applied to the work by heating by a conveyor line. The 
conveyor line includes a pair of conveyors which are 

separated from each other upstream of a position where 
the coating composition is applied to the work to a 

thickness larger than said limit thickness. The heat-hardening 
zone includes a pre-heat-hardening zone for 

half hardening the coating composition and a main heat-hardening 
zone for fully hardening the coating 

composition after the coating composition is half 
hardened. A pooling zone in which a predetermined number 

of works can be temporarily pooled is provided between 
the pre-heat-hardening zone and the main heat-hardening 

zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coating apparatus for
coating a surface of a work, and more particularly to a
rotational coating apparatus in which a coating
composition is applied to the surface of a work to a
thickness larger than a limit thickness of running or
sagging and the work is rotated about a substantially
horizontal axis in order to prevent running or sagging of
the coating composition.It has been known that when a work such as a
vehicle body is coated with a coating composition, the
smoothness of the coating film surface can be improved by
increasing the amount of coating composition to increase
the thickness of the coating film.That is, when a coating composition is applied to
the surface of a work, the surface of the coating film
tends to become smooth due to its surface tension which
acts on the surface of coating film as a tensile force in
a direction parallel to the surface of the coating film.
The smoothening effect by the surface tension becomes
better as the flowability of the coating composition
increases. The flowability of the coating composition
increases with increase in the amount of coating
composition (the thickness of the coating film).
Accordingly, when the amount of the coating composition 
is increased, the flowability of the coating composition
increases and the smoothness of the coating film becomes
better. Especially when the coating composition is
applied to a thickness larger than a limit thickness of
running or sagging, the surface of the coating film
becomes excellently smooth. The "limit thickness of
running or sagging" means a minimum thickness of the
coating film over which running or sagging of the coating
composition will occur and will be referred to simply as
"the running limit thickness", hereinbelow.When the coating composition is applied to a work
having a surface extending substantially in a vertical
direction to a thickness larger than the running limit
thickness, sagging or running of the coating composition
occurs in the vertical surface of the work under gravity,
which greatly deteriorates the smoothness of the coating
film.However when the work is rotated about a
horizontal axis after application of the coating
composition, a force in a direction opposite to the
gravity acts on the coating composition on the vertical
surface and sagging or running of the coating composition
can be prevented. Further a tensile force which acts on
the coating composition in a direction parallel to the
surface of the coating film is generated by the rotation
of the work,
