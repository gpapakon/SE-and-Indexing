<ABSTRACT>
During compound voltage driving for series motor, a 
speed change affect can be obtained from the change in 

torsion in combination with the load. However, during low 
voltage driving or light loading, the speed reduction and 

excitation decrease, compared to output of same torsion will 
result in poor rate of speed adjustment and low efficiency. 

The present design relates to a compensation principle and 
circuit device for compound voltage driving series motor, 

and more specifically there is an independent power supply, 
when motor is at low voltage driving or light-loaded 

operation, the assisted exciting power supply will directly 
employ series winding as the load for exciting in order to 

promote the efficiency of electrical load during low voltage 
and low speed driving.

<DESCRIPTION>
During compound voltage driving for series motor, a 
speed change effect can be obtained from the change in 
torsion in combination with the load. However, during low 
voltage driving or light loading, the speed reduction and 
excitation decrease, compared to output of same torsion will 
result in poor rate of speed adjustment and low efficiency. 
The present design relates to a compensation principle and 
circuit device for compound voltage driving series motor, 
and more specifically there is an independent power supply, 
when motor is at low voltage driving or light-loaded 
operation, the assisted exciting power supply will directly 
employ series winding as the load for exciting in order to 
promote the efficiency of electrical load during low voltage 
and low speed driving. FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the compensation principle 
and circuit device for compound voltage driving series motor 
having assisted field exciting winding. FIG 2 is a diagram showing the embodiment of the 
compensation principle and circuit device for compound 
voltage driving series motor including an assisted field 
exciting winding and sensor elements and control unit. The conventional series motor is highly popular among 
the circle of manufacturing industries due to its great 
starting torsion and small impact to the power supply. 
Nevertheless it is defective with low efficiency during 
series motor at low voltage driving or light-loading 
operation. No improvement has been made with reference to 
all prior arts. Recently owing to the development of 
solid-state electronic techniques, the speed control for 
series motor has been widely applied. However, the defect 
concerning the extra-low efficiency during low voltage 
driving is not improved at all. Especially during low 
voltage driving, as exciting current of series field is 
equivalent to armature current, when armature current is too 
small the field will get weak relatively to reduce the 
torsion so that the rate of speed adjustment is extremely 
poor. The present compensation principle and circuit device 
for compound voltage motor relates to the assisted exciting 
power supply passing by the series field winding in order to 
intensify the exciting current of series winding and promote 
its operational efficiency. The principle of the present design is described as 
below:

voltage driving series motor having assisted field exciting 
winding, comprising:

<CLAIMS>
A compensation principle and circuit device for 
compound voltage driving series motor relates to an 

independent power supply, when motor is at low voltage 
driving or light-loaded operation, the assisted exciting 

power supply will directly employ series winding as the load 
for exciting in order to promote the efficiency of 

electrical load during low voltage and low speed driving, 
comprising: 

   a series field winding S101 series with armature A101 
and parallel connected to the power supply may further have 

shunt winding F102 to appear compound type; 
   an assisted exciting power supply P101 comprising 

storage type electrical element or generator set or other 
electrical device is engaged in assisted exciting against 

series field by virtue of diode CR101 in order to advance 
torque and improve the rate of motor speed adjustment; 

except series diode CR101 between the assisted exciting 
power supply P101 and series field, it may further be series 

with assisted field winding F101 of same exciting polarity 
in order to reduce drop loss of armature current passing by 

series field and maintain a much stable field under same 
exciting intensity condition so as to prevent excessive rise 

of running speed during idle load condition; 
   As mentioned above , the exciting means of assisted 

exciting power supply against series motor field winding 
according to the present compensation principle and circuit 

device for compound voltage driving series motor include: 

(1) continuous exciting; 
(2) the control of relatively exciting current value with 
reference to input voltage; 
(3) the control of relatively exciting current value with 
reference to the loading current value; 
(4) the control of relatively exciting current value with 
reference to both input voltage and loading current 

value. 
The compensation principle and circuit device for 
compound voltage driving series motor according to claim 1 

further including an assisted field exciting winding and 
sensor elements and control unit wherein assisted exciting 

current value is determined subject to motor speed or 
armature anti electric potential or current change of 

assisted exciting power supply against series motor field 
winding or input current or input voltage value, comprising: 

   a series field winding S201 series with armature A201 
to form a DC series motor; 

   an assisted field winding F201 is co-polared winding 
with series field winding S201, and its winding is series 

with the series field winding and then jointly leading to 
the assisted exciting power supply P201 for driving and what 

is particular is that motor armature current is not to pass 
by the assisted field winding; 

   the assisted exciting power supply P 201 comprising 
storage type electrical element or generator set or other 

electrical device, series exciting field winding and 
auxiliary field winding may be series with a choke diode 

CR201 subject to the requirement; 
   the output end of the assisted exciting power supply 

 
P201 may further be series with a CCU201 for series with a 

voltage detector VD201 at the electric input end of motor 
and loading current sensing device ID201 or motor speed 

sensing device or armature anti electric potential sensing 

device EMFD201 at the motor series circuit, for change in 
exciting of assisted exciting power supply P201 against 

series field wilding, because the voltage drop value of 
series field wilding is changed according to loading 

current, so when increase in loading current leads to 
increase in voltage drop, the assisted exciting current will 

be decreased, and when this voltage drop value is greater 
than voltage of assisted exiting power supply, if assisted 

exciting power supply is comprised of storage type element 
such as battery, it may further be serialized with 

current-limit adjustment element Zo between two ends of the 
choke diode CR201, so as to adjust the current charged to 

storage type element, depends upon the signal input to 
central control unit, it may further control motor.
