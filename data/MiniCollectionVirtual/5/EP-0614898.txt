<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compounds having
affinities to δ-opioid receptor. δ-opioid receptor
relates to analgetic, immune and circulatory systems
(especially blood pressure) and ligands having high
selectivities to this receptor can be used as analgesics,
immunosuppressive agents (employed in organ
transplantation (kidney, liver and heart), skin
transplantation, treatment of autoimmune diseases
(rheumatism, various allergies and collagen diseases) and
the like], immunopotentiating agents (anti-tumor agents
and anti-virus agents), blood pressure-lowering agents
and the like.Opioid receptors include three types called µ, δ
and κ. Among these, δ-opioid receptor relates various
pharmacological effects as mentioned above. However, the
number of agonists and antagonists having high
selectivities to this receptor is small and the mechanism
has not yet been clarified. Recently, a non-peptidic
antagonist NTI was discovered by Portoghese (Portoghese,
P.S. et al., J. Med. Chem., 31, 281 (1988); 33, 1714
(1990)). Subsequently, synthesis of an antagonist (5'-NTII)
which can irreversibly bind to the receptor was 
reported (Portoghese, P.S. et al., J. Med. Chem. 33, 1547
(1990)). Since a ligand which irreversibly binds to the
receptor is very useful in studying the receptor,
researchers are paying more and more attention to 5'-NTII.
However, its antagonist activity and selectivity
to δ-opioid receptor are low. Therefore, as a probe for
studying the receptor, a ligand having higher activity
and selectivity is demanded.On the other hand, participation of endogenous
opioid peptides such as enkephalin, and morphine in
immune system has been pointed out and it is known that
opioids may possibly be immunopotentiating agents and
immunosuppressive agents. Paying attention to this, the
present inventors studied influence on immune system by
NTI. As a result, it was shown that this compound
exhibits immunosuppressive action in vitro and in vivo
(Japanese Laid-open Patent Application (Kokai) No. 3-223288).
Since currently used immunosuppressive agents
have problems in toxicities and side effects, an agent
having a low toxicity or having a different mechanism of
action is demanded. It is expected that δ-opioid
antagonist is one of the candidates thereof.It has recently been discovered that opioids relate
to flow of calcium ion into cells, which has a
relationship with ischemia in brain, and that opioids
have brain cell-protecting action. Thus, use of opioids
as a brain cell-protecting agent is more and more 
expected.An
