<ABSTRACT>
A connecting piece for connecting two bars or plates or a bar to a plate at a distance from each other is characterised in that the connecting piece (1) has, in cross-section, two portions with in each case one pair of legs (3, 4; 6, 7) arranged in the shape of a V, the legs being at a smaller distance from each other at the apex of the "V" than other parts of the one pair of legs from the other pair, and in that the apexes are connected by a connecting portion (20). It is thus possible to connect, for example, bars with square profiles at a distance, in such a way that the cross-sections of the bars run diagonally across.

Piece of furniture, in particular a table, 

with at least one connecting member (1) having two 
sections connected to each other via a connecting 

section (20) for connecting the connecting member (1) to 
a stand (60) and to a frame (70) preferentially adapted 

for supporting a plate (80),
 
characterized in that 
each cross section of both sections has a pair of 
V-shaped disposed legs (3, 4; 6, 7) which are connected 

at the tip of the "V" and 
the tips of both "V's" have a separation with respect to 
each other which is smaller than that of other portions 

of one pair of legs from the other pair. 
Piece of furniture according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the connecting sections (20) of the connecting 

member (1) have a cross section which, at one end 
extends from the lower left towards the upper right and, 

at the other end, from the lower right towards the upper 
left. 
Piece of furniture according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the connecting section 

(20) has a straight cross section.  
 
Piece of furniture according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cross section of at 

least one of the legs of one pair is parallel to a leg 
of the other pair. 
Piece of furniture according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, as viewed in cross 

section, a straight line extension of the connecting 
section beyond the tip of the "V" of one of the pairs 

travels in a region between the legs. 
Piece of furniture according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the angular bisectors of 

the angles enclosed by the legs of both pairs are 
aligned with another. 
Piece of furniture according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the angle subtended by the 

legs of one pair is 90Â°.
