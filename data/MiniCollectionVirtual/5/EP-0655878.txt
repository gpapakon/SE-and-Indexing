<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device with light having an electroluminescent element, in 
which a display is easy to see and a circuit is reduced in size. 
A buzzer driving circuit (107) charges and discharges a levelled-up voltage 
that is obtained from a level-up element (102) to a piezoelectric element (106), in 

accordance with a control signal output from a buzzer signal generating circuit 
(111). A control signal inhibiting circuit (105) recognises a signal that is output 

from the buzzer signal generating circuit (111), and outputs control signals to an 
inhibit level-up signal generating circuit (104) and a discharge signal generating 

circuit (110) from outputting a signal. A control signal inhibiting circuit (105) 
recognises a driving pulse for driving an electroluminescent element to light a 

display and a piezoelectric element to sound a buzzer, thereby enabling lighting 
and sounding with one level-up element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic device with a light. In 
particular it relates to such a device, having an electroluminescent element 
(hereinafter referred to as "EL") as the lighting device, which uses a low voltage 
current source as a power source. Conventionally electronic devices with a light, such as electronic watches, 
incorporate small heating bulbs as a device for lighting a display, or use a light 
emitting diode (LED) for the lighting device. Some electronic devices with a light incorporating an LCD panel are 
equipped with back-light from an EL. In the field of electronic watches, an EL is 
used as a device for lighting a display element. However, in a device for lighting a display used in a conventional electronic 
device with a light, since a light source is linear, it is difficult to read a whole 
display when it comes to a rather broad display. Further, though luminous paint is applied to the display instead of light, the 
display cannot be clearly recognised because of the small size of the light source.  It is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic device with a 
light which has a display which can be seen easily. It is another object of the 
present invention to provide an electronic device which can drive a buzzer with a 
low voltage current source and one level-up element. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an 
electronic device comprising an electroluminescent element, electroluminescent 
element driving means for making the electroluminescent element luminescent, and 
control signal inhibiting means for controlling operation of the electroluminescent 
element driving means, wherein the electroluminescent driving means comprises 
discharging means for discharging electric charges charged in the electro-luminescent 
element and means for generating a control signal having a differential 
waveform to control the discharging means. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
method of operation of an electronic device with light incorporating an electro-luminescent 
element as a light source, said method comprising applying a current, 
applying an oscillating signal, and confirming a control signal. If the control signal is indicative that the light is to be on the method further 
comprises generating a level-up signal to enable generation of a levelled-up 
voltage, generating a discharge signal in the form of a differential waveform, 
discharging electric charges from the light element
