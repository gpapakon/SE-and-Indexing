<ABSTRACT>
A first plastic film (90) cut into an effective region (V1) constituting a 
three-dimensional object and unnecessary regions (U1) not constituting 

three-dimensional objects is provided, and a second plastic film (94) is supplied 
to a position above the first plastic film (90). A photosetting bonding 

agent (96) is applied to the lower surface of the second plastic film (94), 
and the portions (96a) corresponding to the sum of the unnecessary regions 

(U1, U2) of the first and second plastic films are cured with the other portion 
(96b) left uncured. The first and second plastic films are then bonded 

to each other by applying light to the uncured layer (96b) so as to cure the 
same. The second plastic film (94) is then cut into an effective region (V2) 

and unnecessary regions (U2). By repeating these steps, plastic films are 
laminated in order, to mold a three-dimensional object.

complicated shape have been disclosed in United States
Patent Nos. 4,961,154 and 5,031,120 by Pomerantz et al.In addition, WO-A-90/02361 (Sparx AB) discloses an
apparatus for forming a three-dimensional object by
laminating sheet members, comprising a movable table for
holding a laminated object formed by laminating sheet
members, each sheet member being cut into a required area
which forms part of said three-dimensional object and an
excess area which does not form part of said three-dimensional
object, sheet feeding means for feeding a second
sheet member of a predetermined length towards said table,
attaching means for attaching said second sheet member to a
first sheet member located on said laminated object, and
cutting means for cutting said first sheet member into a
required area and an excess area.However, the kinds of materials that can be used in the
conventional apparatus are limited, and it is impossible to
form a three-dimensional object by laminating sheets of a
desirable material.An object of the present invention is accordingly to
provide a method of forming a three-dimensional object with
various kinds of sheet materials and an apparatus for the
same. According to a first aspect, the above object is attained
according to the invention
by a method of forming a three-dimensional object

a required area which forms part of said three-dimensional
object and an excess area which does not
form part of said three-dimensional object;(B) feeding a second sheet member above said first
sheet member while interposing a non-solid adhesive layer
between said first and second sheet members, said adhesive
layer being formed in at least part of an area which is
included in both said required area of said first sheet
member and a required area of said second sheet member;(C) attaching said first and second sheet members to
each other by means of said adhesive layer;(D) cutting said second sheet member into said
