<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns moulded articles with leather-like surface properties for use in the automobile industry plus a method of manufacturing them. The mouldings can be produced by adding ground leather waste in a proportion of up to 95 % by wt. to thermoplastics or elastic duroplasts. This makes it possible to give thermoplastics a soft, leather-like feel and a degree of water-absorbability.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing molded articles with leather-like
surface properties for use in the automobile industry,

comprising a thermoplastic material or elastic duroplast
and ground leather waste, characterized in that ground

leather waste having a fiber length of from 0.1 to 5 mm is
added to said thermoplastic materials or elastic duroplasts

in an amount of from 60 to 95% per weight, based on the
molded article, during polymerization or polycondensation.
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that
said ground leather waste is added during casting, in

particular monomer casting, film casting, die casting, open
casting, rotational casting and centrifugal casting,

dipping, in particular paste dipping and powder dipping,
brushing, sintering, in particular sintering molding, pour

sintering, rotational sintering, fluidized-bed coating,
flame spraying and electrostatic coatings, foaming,

compression molding, rolling, calendering, extrusion or
injection molding, while the polymerization or polycondensation

is not yet completed.
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that said ground leather waste is applied in the form of

fibers of the same length to the still uncured molded
article, an electrostatic field is applied, and the plastic

material is cured.
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the desired surface properties are 

obtained by embossing, grinding, plasma treatment, corona
discharge, sandblasting or shot peening.
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 for
producing molded articles comprising surface coatings of

articles, parts of installations, textiles, facings,
sheathings, in particular floor coverings, linings of luggage

boots, roof linings, dashboard sheathings, switches,
shift lever knobs, door knobs and steering wheel coverings.
