<ABSTRACT>
Solvent-free, oil-in-water emulsion polishes, especially useful as automotive polishes, with application, buffability and durability characteristics comparable to solvent-based polishes are described which are substantially free of added organic solvents and conventional surfactants. These emulsion compositions comprise 0.05-25 % of a polymeric silicone wax, 0.1-25 % of a polyorganosiloxane resin, an effective amount, preferably from 0.05-5 %, of a polymeric electrostatic emulsifier such as an acrylates/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate cross polymer which takes the place of conventional surfactants with the balance comprising water.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SOLVENT-FREE WATER-BASED EMULSION POLISHESTechnical FieldThis invention relates to an aqueous oil-in-water emulsion polish composition, especially useful for automobiles, which is substantially free of added organic solvents and water-sensitive surfactants which is based upon a combination of a polymeric silicone wax, a silicone resin and a specific type of polymeric electrostatic emulsifier to obtain a polish composition with buffability, durability and appearance (e.g., film gloss) characteristics of the same order as conventional organic solvent-based polishes.Background Art As the world becomes more ecologically conscious of the potential environmental harm done by volatile organic solvent-based products which release organic solvents into the atmosphere, there is a greater desire to obtain essentially solvent-free compositions to replace such products. Unfortunately, the substitution of water-based compositions for solvent-based compositions in products often sacrifices favorable properties or increases the cost of such products because expensive materials or methods of manufacturing water-based products are required.This is true in the field of polish products, especially four outdoor use such as automobile polishes, where water- based products tend to be harder to apply and buff out to a high shine because they tend to dry faster than organic solvent-based polishes, especially on hot days and in the sun. They may also be less durable than their organic solvent-based counterparts due to the need for water- sensitive surfactants to disperse or emulsify the ingredients into water which tend to remain in polish left behind eventually contribute to loss of the film. Emulsion polishes can also have stability problems and thus a significant amount of surfactant must usually be added to retain product stability. Durability on weathering and against the action of detergents can be helped by the addition of amino- 

 - - -functional silicone polymers which tend to associate with the paint film as are used in conventional organic solvent-based auto compositions, but these ingredients increase the cost of the product. Many of the ingredients used to form a durable polish film on the surface of an automobile such as waxes are difficult to disperse in water due to their desirable hydrophobic properties which are used to form water-repellent polish films.Many different ingredients have been used in polish compositions in the past. Various types of water-based emulsion products have also been proposed for use
