<ABSTRACT>
Telematics system, comprising a telecommunications system and an 
independent identification server, suitable and designed for identification and 

possibly verification of subscribers who wish to make use of telematics servers 
likewise linked to said telecommunications system. The identification server 

works for a plurality of telematics servers, as a result of which the 
identification/verification procedure is uniform for all those telematics 

servers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the identification of users who 
wish to make use, via a terminal and a telecommunications system, of a 
telematics server. The invention also relates to a telecommunications system 
and an identification server, suitable and designed for implementing such a 
method. If at present a user - via a telecommunications system - wishes to 
make use of a telematics service, for example an electronic database for 
enquiring for data, or an electronic mail service, the first step to take place, 
after the user has set up a link to that service, is always an identification and 
(in many cases) verification procedure (sometimes known as authentication 
procedure). This comprises the user making himself known to the service 
(i.e. to the server via which the service is offered) by keying in his user 
identifier on his terminal, in many cases followed by additional keying in of a 
verifier (password) which, for example, is compared on the telematics server 
side with a verifier stored there, or which is enciphered both on the user side 
and on the server side with identical or complementary enciphering 
algorithms, after which the two results are compared with one another. A 
drawback of this situation - which becomes increasingly noticeable as the 
number of services/servers increases - is that each server has its own 
identification procedure, including identifiers, passwords, etc. There is 
general awareness of this problem. Applicant has come to realize that the services proper, and the  
 
identification preceding these can be separated and that the identification can 
be regarded, as it were, as a separate service for the service suppliers (and 
their users). When a service is dialled, use is made, according to the present 
invention, of two services, first the identification service and then the actual 
telematics service asked for. All this can be controlled in a relatively simple 
manner by the telecommunications system which serves as the link between 
the user and the telematics server. This control may, incidentally, also be 
effected by the telematics server itself, independently of the 
telecommunications system. The invention therefore comprises a method for the identification of 
users who wish to make use, via a terminal and a telecommunications system, 
of a telematics server, the following steps being carried out according to the 
invention: 
step 1:the user activates a direct or indirect link via the telecommunications 
system between his terminal and an

<CLAIMS>
Method for the identification of users who wish to make use, via a 
terminal and a telecommunications system, of a telematics server, 

CHARACTERIZED BY 
step 1:the user activates a direct or indirect link via the telecommunications 

system between his terminal and an identification server; step 2:a terminal identifier (TID), belonging to that terminal, is transmitted 
to the identification server; step 3:the identification server asks the user to input his user identifier 

(UID); step 4:the user sends his user identifier, and the identification server 
compares this with user identifiers previously stored in the 

identification server and, in the event of agreement between one of 
these stored user identifiers and the identifier received, sends this 

identifier or an image thereof (UID') to a telematics server selected 
by the user. 
Method according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT in 
step 1 the user activates a link to the identification server, and in step 2 the 

terminal identifier is transmitted directly to the identification server. 
Method according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT in 
step 1 the user activates a link to the telematics service required, and in step 2 

the terminal identifier is first transmitted to the telematics server, after which 
the telematics server activates a link to the identification server and sends that 

terminal identifier on to the identification server. 
Method according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT in 
step 2 the terminal identifier is transmitted by the terminal itself. 
Method according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT in 
step 2 the terminal identifier is transmitted by a terminal server to which the 

terminal is connected, which terminal server does or does not form part of the 
telecommunications system. 
Method according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT in 
step 4 a verification step is intercalated in which the identification server, 

before sending the user identifier or image thereof to the telematics server, 
requests the user to send a user verifier (UVF), after which the identification 

server examines the verifier received and only sends the user identifier or 
image thereof to the telematics server if the result is positive. 
Telematics system, comprising a telecommunications system and 
one or more terminals and telematics servers connected thereto, 

CHARACTERIZED BY an identification server, connected to said 
telecommunications system or comprised by said telecommunications system, 

and suitable and designed for identifying users who, by means of a terminal, 
activate a link between said terminal and a telematics server, a user activating 

a direct or indirect link between said terminal and the identification server, 
and the terminal or a terminal server transmitting a terminal identifier (TID) 

to the identification server, the user further sending his user identifier (UID) 
to the identification server, which compares this with user identifiers 

previously stored in the identification server and, in the event of agreement 
between one of said stored user identifiers and the identifier received, sends 

said identifier or an image thereof (UID') to a telematics server selected by 
the user. 
Identification server for identifying users of one or more 
telematics servers which, by means of a terminal connected to a 

telecommunications system, are able to set up a link to such a telematics 
 

server, the terminal, via the telecommunications system, setting up a direct or 
indirect link to the identification server and sending a terminal identifier 

(TID), after which the user sends a user identifier (UID) and the 
identification server compares this with user identifiers previously stored in 

the identification server and, in the event of agreement between one of said 
stored user identifiers and the user identifier received, sends said identifier or 

an image thereof (UID') to a telematics server to be selected, or already 
selected, by the user.
