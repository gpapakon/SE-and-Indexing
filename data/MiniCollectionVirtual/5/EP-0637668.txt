<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a device for closing and keeping ajar shutters of windows and the like, which device exhibits a base plate for one leaf and a bearing plate with a swivel-type bolt for the other leaf, a locking head being retained in a cutout of the base plate and/or of the bearing plate and being movable in said cutout essentially perpendicularly to the locking swivel plane of the swivel-type bolt, and the locking head being pre-stressed by a spring element arranged in the base plate and/or the bearing plate and projecting over the base plate and/or the bearing plate.

Closure and gap venting apparatus for single, double or 
multiple shutters of windows, doors and the like, comprising 

a base plate (1) which is to be spatially, fixedly 
attached to one of the shutters (2), a bearing 

plate (3) which is to be spatially fixedly mounted to 
the frame or the other of the shutters (4), a pivotable 

latch (7) which is pivotably connected to the bearing 
plate (3) and can be pivoted relative to the latter 

about an axis (9) standing substantially perpendicular 
to the main plane of the bearing plate (3), with the 

pivotable latch (7) being capable of being brought into 
a latching position in which it stands in engagement 

with the base plate (1) so that a movement of the shutter 
(2, 4) is prevented in the installed state of the 

closure and gap venting apparatus in the closed position 
of the shutter (2, 4) and also in at least one gap venting 

position in which at least one shutter (2, 4) is 
slightly opened, characterised in that the latching head 

(14) is held in a cut-out (15) of the base plate (1) or 
of the bearing plate (3) and is movable in this cut-out 

(15) substantially perpendicular to the latching-pivoting 
plane of the pivotable latch (7); and in that 

the latching head (14) is biased by a spring element arranged 
in the base plate (1) or in the bearing plate (3) 

and projects beyond the base plate (1) or beyond the 
bearing plate (3). 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterised in 
that the latching head (14) has a run-up ramp (16) associated 

with the pivotable latch (7), which co-operates 
with the pivotable latch (7) in such a way that the 

latching head (14) is moved into the cut-out (15) of the  
 

base plate (1) or of the bearing plate (3) against the 
spring force of the spring element on a pivotal movement 

of the pivotable latch (7) into the latched position out 
of the pivot plane of the pivotable latch (7). 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, characterised 
in that the latching head (14) is released from 

the pivotable latch (7) in the latched position of the 
pivotable latch (7) so that it projects through the 

spring force of the spring element into the pivotal 
plane of the pivotable latch (7) and prevents an independent 

pivotal movement of the pivotable latch (7) out 
of the latched position. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the base plate (1) has a 

U-shaped mount (10) for the pivotable latch associated 
with the pivotable latch (7), into which the pivotable 

latch (7) engages in the closed position of the shutters 
(2, 4); in that furthermore a coupling spigot (11) is 

provided on the base plate (1) for a coupling sleeve 
(12) associated with the pivotable latch (7); and in 

that in the venting gap position and in each case in the 
latched position the latching head (14) engages over the 

pivotable latch (7) or over the coupling sleeve (12). 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one coupling 

sleeve is provided at the base plate (1) and at least 
one coupling spigot respectively associated with the 

coupling sleeve is provided at the pivotable latch (7), 
with the coupling sleeve and the coupling spigot coming 

into engagement in the closed position of the shutters 
(2, 4) in the latched position; and in that a coupling 

sleeve provided at the base plate (1) and a coupling  
 

spigot associated with it at the pivotable latch (7) 
come into engagement in the gap venting position of the 

shutters (2, 4) in the latched position, with the latching 
head (14) being effective in both latching positions. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that, at the base plate (1), 

guide spigots (13) are provided on both sides of the 
coupling spigot (11) provided on it and form, together 

with the coupling spigot (11) the U-shaped mount (10) 
for the pivotal latch and have in the gap venting position 

a lateral guiding function for the coupling sleeve 
(12). 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the pivotable latch has a 

cut-out which, in the latched position of the pivotable 
latch (7), frees the latch head (14) for a movement perpendicular 

to the plane of pivoting of the pivotable 
latch. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the latching head (14) is 

provided at one end of a two-armed blocking lever (20) 
which is pivotably mounted in the base plate (1) or in 

the bearing plate (3) in a plane extending substantially 
perpendicular to the plane of pivoting of the pivotable 

latch (7) and which has an actuating end (21) projecting 
out of the base plate (1) or out of the bearing plate 

(3). 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 8, characterised in 

that a draw ring (22) is provided at the actuating end 
(21) of the blocking lever (20).
