<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a reactor for removing impurities 
from a liquid, in particular for de-inking, including a tank (1) within which 

the liquid to be purified together with a gas or air is introduced (2-3); a 
drain of the purified accepted through an outlet (7) of said tank (1); inlets 

(8-11, 9-12, 10-13) at different heights of the tank (1) connected to said 
purified liquid outlet (7) together with the inlet of gas or air; a rotating shaft 

(18) inside the tank (1) carrying blades (20, 21, 22, 23) at the different 
heights of the tank within which the liquid together with gas or air is 

introduced.; the blades (20, 21, 22, 23) have progressively increasing 
heights when moving towards the lower portion of the tank (1). The 

invention also concerns the method embodied by the above-described 
reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a reactor for removing impurities 
from a liquid, in particular for de-inking suspensions deriving from printed 
waste paper. Apparatuses are known for removing impurities from liquids and in 
particular for de-inking paper suspensions, said apparatuses being based 
on the flotation method.  
 For example US 4 094 783 relates a separator for removing 
impurities from a contaminated liquid including: 
a tank having an upper and a lower portion; a main inlet in said upper portion, and gas or air inlet means 
connected to said main inlet, the liquid to be purified being 
introduced together with gas or air in said tank through said main 
inlet; an outlet located in the lower portion of said tank to drain off the 
purified liquid; and inlets at different heights in the tank connected to said purified liquid 
outlet, and gas or inlet means connected to said inlets, a portion of 
the purified liquid being continuously introduced together with air or 
gas in the tank at said different heights through said inlets,  
with the drawback that this patent does not solve the problem to provide a 
reactor and method for improving the purification efficiency while 
increasing pulp density and cleaning of the light polluting portions. On the contrary the present invention as defined in claims 
1 to 8 solves the problem eliminating such drawback 
with the introduction of a portion of the purified liquid with 
air or gas at different heights in the tank in the positions where different 
blades are rotating for stirring the liquid, with further features that the 
stirring is increased from the upper portion towards the lower portion of the 
tank and that the liquid together with the gas or air is pushed towards the 
central area of the tank while being stirred. Other patents as EP 0 037 513, DE 3 524 071 and US 5 096 572 
relate to reactors for removing impurities from a liquid, but also all such 
prior patents do not solve the problem of the present invention.  
 Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will be 
apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred but not 
exclusive embodiment thereof, illustrated merely as a non-limiting example 
in the annexed figures wherein: 
Fig.1 is a schematic sectional view of the present reactor;  Fig.2 is a schematic horizontal cross section of fig.1; and Fig.3 is an outer side view of the reactor of fig.1. Referring to the figures, the present reactor includes a tank 1 within 
which, in the upper portion thereof, there is

<CLAIMS>
A reactor for removing impurities from a liquid, in 
particular for de-inking, said reactor including: 


a tank (1) having an upper and a lower portion; 
a main inlet (2) in said upper portion, and gas or 
air inlet means (3) connected to said main inlet (2), 

the liquid to be purified being introduced together 
with gas or air in said tank (1) through said main 

inlet (2); 
an outlet (7) located in the lower portion of said 
tank (1) to drain off the purified liquid; 
inlets (8, 9, 10) at different heights in the tank 

(1) connected to said purified liquid outlet (7), and 
gas or inlet means (11, 12, 13) connected to said inlets 

(8, 9, 10), a portion of the purified liquid being 
continuously introduced together with air or gas 

in the tank (1) at said different heights through 
said inlets (8, 9, 10); 
 
characterized in that
 
   it comprises a rotary shaft (18) in the tank (1), 

said rotary shaft (1) being provided with blades (20, 
21, 22, 23) suitable to stir the liquid at the different 

heights of the tank (1) within which the liquid 
is introduced together with gas or air. 
A reactor according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said blades (20, 21, 22, 23) have progressively increasing 

heights when moving from the upper portion towards 
the lower portion of the tank (1). 
A reactor according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said blades (20, 21, 22, 23) are
