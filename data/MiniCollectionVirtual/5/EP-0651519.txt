<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interference detector for an interference reducing
device which detects and reduces unmodulated carriers,
narrow-band FM carriers, or their sweep carriers which get
mixed as interference carriers into the communication band
in a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) digital satellite
communication system.With the development of satellite communication systems,
the number of earth stations which access the same satellite
is on the increase. Occasionally the situation arises where
non-modulated carriers, narrow-band FM carriers, or their
sweep carriers are emitted as unwanted carriers owing to a
fault or operation mistake of earth station equipment. In
the TDMA system each station transmits, every fixed period
of time called a TDMA frame, a burst-like TDMA signal of a
fixed carrier frequency within a certain time slot allotted
to the station. To establish burst synchronization for high
precision control of the burst transmission timing of
respective stations to ensure that they send their bursts at
different timing, a reference station sends a reference
burst for each TDMA frame. The reference burst is used for
system control as well as for maintaining the synchronization
of the TDMA system. On the other hand, a traffic station
for transmitting and receiving information sends a traffic
burst. The application of the above-mentioned unwanted
carriers as interference carriers to the TDMA system not only
degrades the signal quality but also may sometimes hinder the
system control by the reference burst and synchronization of
the traffic burst, making communication impossible throughout 
the system.In the time division multiple access system (the TDMA
system) introduced in the digital satellite communication,
each station transmits a burst-like TDMA signal of a fixed
carrier frequency within a certain time slot allotted to the
station. To establish burst synchronization for high precision
control of the burst transmission timing of respective
stations so that they send their bursts at different timing,
a synchronization burst is inserted for each TDMA frame.
The synchronization burst (a reference burst) sent from a
reference station is employed for system control as well as
for maintaining the synchronization of the TDMA system. An
interference carrier, if mixed in such a communication
system, will degrade the signal quality and, further, may
sometimes destroy the burst synchronization and the system
control by the reference burst, leading to a failure in
communication.For
