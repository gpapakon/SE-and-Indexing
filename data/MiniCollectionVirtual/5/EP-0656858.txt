<ABSTRACT>
An edge protector for use in particular on generally flat-faced, panel-like articles such as doors, worktops, tabletops and the like, and to the articles when fitted with the edge protector. The edge protector is of "U-section", the sides of said "U-section" being thinner than the base, the said sides and at least a part of the base being formed from a single length of semi-rigid paper, said base including at least one extra piece of paper located between the said sides, characterised in that the said single length is of corrugated paper and in that the fluting of the corrugations runs laterally around the "U-section".

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an edge protector and fitted 
article, and relates in particular to an edge protector for 
use on generally flat faced, panel-like articles such as 
doors, worktops, tabletops and the like (herein referred to 
as articles), and to articles fitted with such an edge 
protector. During or following manufacture, it is customary for 
several articles as defined above to be laid horizontal, 
and stacked one above another, to await removal to the next 
stage or to store, or ready for delivery to a customer. If the articles are stacked for long-term storage i.e they 
are likely to be long held in store, they may sag or warp, 
and it is desirable that the articles be closely stacked so 
that the degree of sagging of an articles can perhaps be 
limited by the article below. Furthermore, if stack height 
is critical, then if they are more closely stacked extra 
articles can be stored or transported "as a stack". The peripheral edges, however, of the articles are at risk 
from damage both during storage and transportation, and it  
 
is customary for the manufacturer, and often also the 
customer, to require an adequate thickness of article edge 
protection designed to reduce the likelihood, and/or 
severity, of any such damage. It will be understood that although a desired edge 
protector shape may readily nowadays be formed in a 
plastics material, users are increasingly conscious of the 
environmental implications and the public reaction to the 
plastics disposal problem, particularly for "one trip" 
packaging materials. Many currently available edge 
protectors are manufactured from moulded polystyrene or 
polyethylene, but users have for some years been actively 
seeking environmentally acceptable alternatives; 
specifically, in a technical area in which recycled or 
recyclable materials may easily be employed, many 
manufacturers and users are increasingly resisting the use 
of materials which are not and/or may not be recycled, and 
instead would prefer to use recycled materials if of the 
same or similar cost and performance. A known recyclable material is corrugated paper, such as 
single-faced corrugated paper in which one corrugated sheet 
is adhered at the corrugation peaks to a sheet of 
substantially planar paper. The single-faced corrugated 
paper thus has on one side parallel exposed fluting running 
in a selected direction (transverse to the rolled direction  
 
of formed paper); such corrugated paper is flexible about 
mould lines parallel to the fluting. Another form of

An edge protector (10,110,210,) of "U-section" and 
having a base (28,228,328) and opposed sides 

(26,126,226,326), the sides of said "U-section" being 
thinner than the base, the said sides and at least part 

of the base being formed from a single length of semi-rigid 
paper (24), said base including at least one 

extra piece of paper (30,230,252,330) located between 
the said sides, characterised in that the said single 

length (24) is a single layer of corrugated paper, in 
that said one extra piece of paper (30,230,252,330) is 

of corrugated paper, and in that a fluting (34,234) of 
the corrugations of said single length runs laterally 

around the "U-section", and a fluting (256) of said 
extra piece runs parallel to said base and 

substantially perpendicular to said sides. 
An edge protector according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the corrugated paper is single-faced, and in that 

the said fluting (34,234) faces outwardly of the U-section. 
An edge protector according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the said at least one extra piece 

of paper comprises at least two layers (30) of single-faced 
corrugated paper adhered together and adhered to 

the sides (26) of the "U-section".  
 
An edge protector according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the extra layer of paper (330) is 

of single-faced corrugated paper reverse-folded back 
upon itself to form a thickened strip, the strip being 

adhered to the sides (326) of the "U-section". 
An edge protector according claim 4 characterised in 
that the strip is adhered to the sides of the "U-section" 

by one of latex and PVA. 
An edge protector according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the said extra piece of paper is 

a layer of corrugated paper having a part (252) in the 
erected condition of the edge protector spaced from the 

base, in that an aperture (250) is provided between the 
base and the said part, and in that the edge protector 

(210) may be folded substantially flat with said part 
alongside the base. 
An edge protector according to claim 6 characterised in 
that further layers (230) of corrugated paper are 

removably located within the aperture. 
An edge protector according to any preceding claim 
characterised in that the sides (26,126,226,326) of the 

"U-section" converge, being more closely spaced away 
from the base than at the base, and in that the sides  

 
(126) are longitudinally kinked whereby to provide a 

lead-in for an article to which the edge protector is 
to be fitted. 
An article (14) fitted with an edge protector 
(10,110,210) according to any of claims 1-8. 
An article (14) fitted with an edge protector 
(10,110,210) according to any of claims 1-9 

characterised in that the sides (26,126,226,326) of the 
"U-section" are spaced apart by a distance less than 

the thickness of the article so that there is a 
friction grip between the edge protector and the 

article.
