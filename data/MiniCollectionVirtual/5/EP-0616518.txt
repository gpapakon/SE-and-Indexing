<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a hair-fixing agent based on a water-containing solution of at least one natural or synthetic film-forming polymer containing a combination of (A) at least one water-soluble, halogen-free organic solvent and (B) 0.05 to 2 % by wt. of at least one compound which is insoluble in water but soluble in the agent at room temperature and which is selected from the C8 to C20 alkane diols, C8 to C20 alkane triols, monoglycerides and dimonoglycerides of saturated and unsaturated C12 to C20 fatty acids, C12 to C20 fatty alcohols ethoxylated with 2 or 3 moles of ethylene oxide, siloxane/ether copolymers with a cloud point lower than 20  DEG C, oxyethylene/oxypropylene block polymers and oxyethylene/oxybutylene block polymers, the ratio by weight of component A to component B being 1000:1 to 2.5:1. In addition to fixing the hair well, the agent proposed gives a considerable improvement in the wet and dry combability.
