<ABSTRACT>
An exemplary priming assembly (100) comprises a container (10) of priming fluid, a syringe (1), flow control devices (4, 5, 12), a vent (6), a filter element (3), and a bypass assembly (20). In one embodiment, flow control devices (4, 5, 12) are adjusted so that priming fluid passes through the bypass assembly (20) and enters the syringe (1). Flow control device (12) is then adjusted so that gas is expelled through the vent (6). Flow control devices (4, 5, 12) are then adjusted so that priming fluid is directed into the filter (3), displacing gas as the priming fluid is returned to the container (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PRIMING SYSTEMTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a system, apparatus, and method for priming a fluid processing or treating device. The invention also relates to a system, apparatus and method for treating a fluid.Bac cfround of the InventionThere are a number of methods and devices for processing and/or treating various fluids. For example, a number of therapeutic protocols for pathophysiological conditions involve the removal of a bodily fluid from a patient, treating that fluid to remove an undesirable component, and returning it to the patient. As another example, water may be rendered potable by passing it through a filter that removes substances such as bacteria.Nevertheless, these methods, and the devices utilized to carry them out, have been inefficient in that they may require extra time and/or effort for priming. Additionally, these devices may waste fluid since a portion of the fluid may be held up in the devices. This may be expensive since the fluid may be unrecoverable and/or incompletely processed. Additionally, an additional labor intensive effort may be required to retrieve the held up fluid. Furthermore, especially when a separate fluid treatment assembly or device is added to the system, the devices utilized may be awkward to use, or may compromise sterility by allowing the introduction of bacteria and/or air.These problems involving cost, labor, sterility and time are magnified when the fluid is valuable, especially when only a limited amount is available. For example, a number of therapeutic and non- 

 therapeutic protocols involve attaching an assembly to a individual, removing a bodily fluid (e.g., blood) , treating the fluid, and returning it to the individual. Since the individual only has a finite amount of that fluid, it may be necessary to minimize loss, preferably with minimal additional effort.Moreover, during such protocols it is important to maintain sterility without administering inappropriate substances such as air. Furthermore, since patient fluid treatment protocols may present some risk to the patient, the time and operator sophistication required to perform them should be minimized to decrease the risk to the patient. In view of this, there is a demand for a system and method for easily, simply, and effectively, priming a fluid processing or treating device. The system and method should also provide these same advantages when a separate fluid treatment assembly or device is added to the system. Additionally, there is a growing need for a simple system and

 Claims
1. A method for treating a fluid comprising: a. passing priming fluid through a fluid treatment element; b. passing fluid through a bypass connected in parallel with the fluid treatment element; c. passing the fluid through the fluid treatment element thereby passing priming fluid in the fluid treatment assembly into a container; and d. recovering fluid in the fluid treatment element by passing priming fluid from the container through the fluid treatment element, thereby driving fluid ahead of the priming fluid from the fluid treatment element.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein a further step comprises venting gas from the fluid treatment assembly.
3. A method for priming a fluid processing apparatus comprising: passing a priming fluid through a bypass connected in parallel with a fluid treatment element; venting gas from the fluid processing apparatus; and passing the priming fluid through the fluid treatment element.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein venting gas from the fluid processing apparatus comprises passing the gas displaced by the priming fluid through a vent.
5. The method of claim 3 wherein venting gas from the fluid processing apparatus comprises passing the gas displaced by the priming fluid in the bypass 


 through a first vent, and passing the gas displaced by the priming fluid in the fluid treatment element through a second vent.
6. The method of claim 3 further comprising treating the fluid by withdrawing the fluid from a patient and introducing the treated fluid back into the patient.
7. A method of depleting a deleterious or undesirable substance from a patient's fluid comprising: passing a priming fluid through a bypass connected in parallel with a fluid treatment element, wherein the fluid treatment element includes at least one porous medium suitable for removing a deleterious or undesirable substance from the patient's fluid; exhausting the gas displaced by the priming flui -through a vent; passing the priming fluid through the fluid treatment element; withdrawing a fluid containing a deleterious or undesirable substance from a patient through the bypass; and passing the patient's fluid through the primed fluid treatment element to deplete the deleterious or undesirable substance from the fluid.
8. The method of claim 7 further comprising introducing the depleted fluid into the patient.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein withdrawing a fluid containing a deleterious or undesirable substance from a patient through the bypass and 


passing the patient's fluid through the primed fluid treatment element to deplete the deleterious or undesirable substance from the fluid comprises withdrawing cerebrospinal fluid from a patient through the bypass and passing it through the primed fluid treatment element.
10. An apparatus comprising: a fluid treatment element; a bypass connected in parallel with the fluid treatment element; a differential pressure generator in communication with the fluid treatment element and the bypass; and at least one vent in communication with at least one of the differential pressure generator, the fluid treatment element, and the bypass.
11. The apparatus of claim 10 further comprising at least one flow control device in communication with at least one of the differential pressure generator, the fluid treatment element, and the bypass.
12. The apparatus of claim 10 wherein the fluid treatment element comprises at least one porous medium.
