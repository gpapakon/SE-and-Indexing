<ABSTRACT>
The liquid is fed by a piston pump (6) to a nozzle device (16) and for spraying is driven through the nozzle device (16) by the pump pressure. The liquid feed to the nozzle device (16) is pressure-relieved by a pressure-release valve (28) just before the end of a spraying period in such a way that the liquid (4) to be sprayed is sprayed until the end of the intended spraying period by the liquid pressure prevailing in the line system. Only at the end of the spraying period is the liquid feed also cut off or interrupted. By the partial pressure release of the liquid (4) before the expiry of the spraying period, subsequent dripping or subsequent spraying after the expiry of the spraying period is avoided.

Spray device for fluid, especially for printing machines, in order to spray fluid onto
a rotating printing press cylinder or on to moving printed material in a printing

press, containing a nozzle device (16) to atomise and spray the atomised fluid (4)
in the form of a jet of spray (18) during a total, preset time of a spray cycle, a

suction line (12) which links the suction side (10) of the pump (6; 7) in the circuit
to a tank (4) (sic) and contains a suction line valve (14) and, when said valve is

open, the pump can draw in fluid (4) from the tank (2), at least one pressure line
(22; 22, 22/2, 22/3, 22/4, 22/5 etc.) which links the delivery side (20) of the pump

(6; 7) to the nozzle device (16) and contains a pressure line valve (24; 44, 44/2,
44/3 etc.) and, when said valve is open, the pump (6; 7) is able to deliver the fluid

which has been drawn in, through the pressure line (22; 22, 22/2, 22/3, 22/4, 22/5
etc.) to the nozzle device (6),

characterised in that

a pressure relief line (26) is provided, which branches off between the pressure line
valve (24; 44,44/2, 44/3 etc.) and the nozzle device (16) from the pressure line

(22; 22, 22/2, 22/3, 22/4, 22/5) and contains a pressure relief valve (28) which is
automatically controlled by a control device (38), which (38, 28) are designed so

that, throughout the operation of the fluid spray device, the pressure relief valve
(28) is kept closed by the control device (38) at least during an initial time of the

spray cycle long enough for the pump (6; 7) to deliver fluid to the nozzle device
(16) during this time and by means of which it can be atomised, but is opened by

the control device (38) not later than the time of the end of the spray cycle and
consequently allows the fluid pressure to escape from the pressure line (22; 22,

22/2, 22/3, 22/4, 22/5 etc.) into the pressure relief line (26).
Spray device for fluid, according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 
during operation, the pressure relief valve (28) is opened automatically very shortly

before the end of the spray cycle and is then kept open past the end of the spray
cycle during a preset pressure relief time before it is then closed again for the next

spray cycle, the time before the end of the spray cycle being so short that the fluid
pressure produced by the pump (6; 7) causes the fluid to atomise at the nozzle

device (16) right up to the end of the spray cycle.
Spray device for fluid according to Claim 2,

characterised in that

during operation the pressure relief valve (28) is opened automatically
approximately 1 s or some tenths of a second very shortly before the end of the

spray cycle.
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the pump (6) is a piston pump which in turn executes a suction stroke and an
equivalent compression stroke, that during operation the time of the compression

stroke is approximately the same as the spray cycle so that the volume of fluid
delivered during the compression stroke is in each case approximately equal to the

volume of fluid which is atomised during a spray cycle.
Spray device for fluid according to Claim 4,

characterised in that

the suction stroke travel of the piston pump is adjustable and that the spray device
is designed in such a way that, in operation, it always moves the pump piston (8),

during the compression stroke, up to the end of the compression stroke travel
regardless of the size of the suction stroke.
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 
the suction line valve (14) is a non-return valve which opens in the direction of

flow to the pump (6; 7), but closes in the opposite direction.
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 6

characterised in that

the pressure line valve (24) is a non-return valve which opens in the direction of
flow away from the pump (6) but closes in the opposite direction.
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 6

characterised in that

the pressure line valve (44, 44/2, 44/3 etc.) is a valve controlled by the control
device (38) and which is opened or closed, as relevant, by the control device

synchronised to the times when the pressure relief valve (28) is open and closed.
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that

a number of pressure lines (22, 22/2, 22/3 etc.) are connected to the delivery side
(20) of the pump (6, 7) for a corresponding number of nozzle devices (16).
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that

there is mounted in the flow path between the pump (7) and the pressure line valve
(44, 44/2, 44/3 etc.), close to or in the outlet (20) at the delivery side of the pump

(7) a non-return valve (50) which opens in the direction of flow away from the
pump (7) towards the pressure line valve and closes in the opposite direction, and

which is forced by a spring (51) into the closing direction in order to prevent fluid
or air being drawn off from the pressure line (22, 22/2, 22/3 etc.) into the pump (7)

during a suction stroke.
Spray device for fluid according to one of the Claims 1 to 10
 
characterised in that

the nozzle device (16) has at least one nozzle opening (32) and a non-return valve

(34) upstream close to this nozzle opening (32) which is forced by a valve spring
(35) into a closed position and is opened by the pressure of the fluid in the pressure

line (22; 22, 22/2, 22/3, etc.) against the force of the valve spring (35) in the spray
direction.
