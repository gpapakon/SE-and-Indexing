<ABSTRACT>
A method of setting chromatic correction in exposure 
determining algorithms of an automatic photographic 

printer using inferential illuminant detection derived 
from data recorded at a camera during picture taking. For 

scenes having a scene light level above a predetermined 
level, daylight chromatic correction is set at the 

printer. For scenes having a scene light level below this 
level, daylight chromatic correction is set at the 

printer if sufficient flash illuminant is determined from 
the recorded data to exist in the image otherwise a 

non-daylight chromatic correction corresponding to a high 
degree of chromatic correction is set at the printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of photographic
systems with provision for detection of scene illuminant
and the use thereof to provide chromatic correction in
the photographic printing process.Scene color balance algorithms employed in automatic
printers conventionally employ measurements of film
density (R,G,B) and related mathematical techniques to
attempt to deduce from the film the optimum level of
chromatic correction to be applied on a scene-by-scene
basis to the exposure of the film to photographic print
paper. It is known that scene color-induced printer
correction failures occur when the printer algorithm is
unable to differentiate between sources of color
variability in the film image that require high levels of
chromatic correction (e.g. non-daylight illuminants, film
processing effects, film keeping effects and
manufacturing variability) and source of color
variability that do not require high levels of chromatic
correction, (e.g. highly colorful objects in the scene).
It is desirable, therefore, to be able to identify and
segregate sources of color variability according to the
level of chromatic correction required.One of the most common causes of color variability
in the film image is scene illuminant. It is useful to
be able to identify the type of scene illuminant and
input this information to the printer algorithm for use
in selecting and applying the appropriate level of 
chromatic correction. In commonly assigned U.S. Patents
4,827,119 and 5,037,198, camera apparatus is described
which is capable of detecting and discriminating among
the various common sources of scene illuminants: natural,
tungsten and fluorescent, by performing a Fourier series
analysis on one or more of the harmonics of the
illuminant signal generated from a light sensor in the
camera. It is possible to record this discriminated data
at the time of image capture for transfer to the
photofinishing printer to be applied to the exposure
determining algorithm process. Such data recording
transfer processes might be, for example, optical data
recording as a latent image on the film, magnetic data
recording either on a magnetic layer formed on the film
or on separable magnetic media, or electronic recording
on a programmable memory medium (EEPROM).The employment of specialized illuminant detection
and discrimination apparatus such as referred to above,
while effective for the purpose, has the disadvantage of
adding cost and complexity to the camera design.
Moreover, such systems are based on detection of known
harmon

A photographic printing method of
exposing a film image frame (30) onto print paper (64) in which a degree of

illuminant chromatic correction is set from information derived from picture-taking data and
recorded at a camera (10) ;

the method comprising:

detecting at a photographic printer (36) said
recorded information; and
determining from said detected information
instructions relating to scene light level and the

existence or non-existence of a predetermined amount of
flash illuminant in the film image frame; characterized by
setting a low degree of chromatic correction
corresponding to daylight correction when said

instructions relate to either a) a scene light level
above a predetermined value or b) a scene light level

below a predetermined value and that said pretermined
amount of flash illuminant exists in the film frame

image; and
setting a high degree of chromatic correction

corresponding to non-daylight correction when said
instructions relate to a scene light level below said

predetermined value and that said predetermined amount of
flash illuminant does not exist in the film frame image.
The method of claim 1 wherein said
predetermined value of scene light level, in

information indicating the combined circumstance that
said scene light level is below said predetermined value
