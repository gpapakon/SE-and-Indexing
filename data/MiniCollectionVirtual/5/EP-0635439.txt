<ABSTRACT>
A container bag (10) having a base (14), side walls (12) and 
lifting loops (16) is characterised in that the central 

portions (15) of the side walls of the bag or of a liner within 
the bag (10) are stiffened relative to the corner portions (20) whereby 

to effect a squarer shape to the bag (10). The stiffening may be 
achieved by fabric from which the bag (10) (or liner) is to be made 

being selectively stiffened in those areas destined to form the 
central wall portions (15) by using different weave densities, more 

or additional threads of either the same or a different kind, 
additional layers of material being attached e.g. by adhesion 

in the relevant areas, or a stiffening coating compostion e.g. 
of a polymer applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to container bags and in particular 
relates to container bags for carrying loads in the range of 
one half to two tonnes and known as flexible intermediate bulk 
containers (FIBC's). Flexible Intermediate bulk containers are increasingly employed 
in cargo handling and transporting situations, especially for 
the carriage of particulate or pulverulent material. A typical 
FIBC will be manufactured from a fabric woven from a polyolefin 
tape and have intregal lifting loops. Examples of such 
containers are described in UK patent numbers 1591091 and 
2063816. FIBC's have to meet various national and 
international safety standards; for example it is normal to 
require a five to one safety ratio, that is an IBC rated at one 
tonne should not break under loads of less than five tonnes. A recent trend in the FIBC field has been the increasing usage 
of FIBC's having a much squarer configuration for powdered, 
flaked or granular materials which do not form a stable 
package when filled into an FIBC. Examples include products 
with a low specific gravity. Other products tend to pack more 
firmly in a square cross-section. The square configuration 
also improves the packing of filled FIBC's in, for example, ISO 
containers, as well as improving stacking. One proposal for obtaining an FIBC more square in plan view 
involves sewing baffles across the internal corners to hold the 
square shape. The baffles have holes in them to allow the 
product to flow into the corners. However, the provision of 
baffles of the the required configuration and, in particular 
the extra sewing required, increases the cost of manufacture of 
these bags. The invention seeks to provide a container bag improved in the 
above respect.  According to the present invention there is provided a 
container bag having a base, side walls and lifting loops 
characterised in that the central portions of the side walls of 
the bag or of a liner within the bag are stiffened relative to 
the corner portions whereby to effect a squarer shape to the 
bag. The stiffening may be achieved in several ways. The fabric 
from which the bag (or liner) is to be made may be selectively 
stiffened in those areas destined to form the central wall 
portions by using different weave densities, more or additional 
threads of either the same or a different kind, additional 
layers of material being attached e.g. by adhesion in the 
relevant areas, or a stiffening coating compostion e.g. of a 
polymer applied. Since liners are normally made

<CLAIMS>
A container bag which comprises a base, side walls and 
lifting loops characterised in that the central portions of 

the side walls of the bag, or of a liner within the bag, are 
stiffened relative to the corner portions whereby to effect a 

squarer shape to the bag. 
A bag as claimed in claim 1 in which the fabric from which 
the bag is to be made is selectively stiffened in those areas 

destined to form the central wall portions by using different 
weave densities, more or additional threads of either the same 

or a different kind, additional layers of material being 
attached by adhesion in the relevant areas, or a stiffening 

coating compostion a polymer applied. 
A bag as claimed in claim 1 in which a liner is provided, 
the liner being of a fabric selectively stiffened in those 

areas destined to form the central wall portions by additional 
layers of material being attached by adhesion in the relevant 

areas, or a stiffening coating compostion a polymer applied. 
A bag as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2 in which the 
central portions of the side wall are stiffened by additional 

threads of higher tenacity than those normally used in the body 
and the lifing loops are attached to the stiffened central 

portions. 
A bag as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 in which the base 
of the FIBC and/or the liner is square or has corners of 

increased radius giving it a bulbous appearance. 
A bag as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 in which the 
container bag is fitted with a top and/or a filling spout 

and/or a discharge spout.
