<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the cloning of nucleic acids, characterised in that two partly complementary, double-stranded primers are ligated to the 3' end of a single-stranded DNA strand. The second strand is synthesised by means of a DNA polymerase, with the primers used being at least partly complementary with the oligonucleotide which is ligated on. The target DNA obtained in this way can then be specifically amplified with two specific oligonucleotides.

Process for cloning nucleic acids with unknown 3'-end,
wherein:


in a first step a ligation of a double-stranded
combination of two primers that are partially complementary

to one another to the 3' end of a single-stranded
DNA strand is carried out, wherein one

primer at one end extends beyond the complementary
region with an overhang representing a degenerated

region, wherein the ligation is triggered in presence
of an enzyme being specific for double-stranded

DNA
in a second step the second strand is synthesized
by means of a DNA polymerase in which a primer is

used which is complementary to at least part of the
ligated oligonucleotide and
if desired, the cDNA obtained in this manner is amplified
in a third step.
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the single-stranded
DNA is formed by reverse transcription of a template

RNA.
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the single-stranded
DNA is formed by processing a template DNA.
Process as claimed in claim 2 and 3 using modified oligos
in the second strand synthesis and in the PCR which 

lead to a product being formed that is resistant to digestion
by restriction endonucleases.
Process as claimed in claim 4 using m
5
C as a modified
base in an oligonucleotide.
Process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the cDNA prepared
by primer extension is separated.
Process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the separation is
carried out by means of affinity chromatography.
Process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the separation is
made possible by modified primers or oligonucleotides.
Process as claimed in claim 8, wherein a biotinylated or
digoxigenylated, labelled primer is used for this.
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein oligonucleotides
are used as the primers which lead to the generation of

restriction enzyme recognition sites in the product.
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the overhang of
the primer pair comprises more than three and less than

6 nucleotides.
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the ligation is
triggered by the presence of an enzyme that is specific

for double-stranded DNA.
Process as claimed in claim 12, wherein this enzyme is
T4 DNA ligase. 
Process as claimed in claim 12, wherein it is a thermostable
ligase.
Process as claimed in claim 2, wherein a thermostable
enzyme is used for the reverse transcription.
Process as claimed in claim 15, wherein it is a DNA polymerase
with reverse transcriptase activity e.g. Tth

DNA polymerase.
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the double-stranded
DNA is produced by a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.
Process as claimed in claim 17, wherein it is the Klenow
fragment of the DNA polymerase from E. coli.
Process as claimed in claim 17, wherein it is a thermostable
DNA polymerase.
Process as claimed in claim 19, wherein it is Taq Pol.
Process as claimed in claim 17, wherein modified primers
are used for this which allow a purification of the single-stranded

DNA that is formed.
Process as claimed in claim 21, wherein the modification
is biotin and the affinity matrix is avidin or streptavidin

or the modification is digoxigenin and the affinity
matrix is anti-DIG antibody.
Process as claimed in claim 12, wherein the ligation
temperature is between 15° and 25°C and the ligation is

carried out for a period of 1 to 16 hours. 
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a further, new
primer complementary to part of the sequence region ligated

to the single-stranded DNA is used in the third
step.
Process as claimed in claim 24, wherein several amplification
cycles are subsequently carried out.
