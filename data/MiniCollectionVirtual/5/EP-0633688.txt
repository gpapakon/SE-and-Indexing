<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus and method produce, when 
600 dpi image data is generated from 300 dpi image data, 

interpolated data of a pixel of interest by a two-value 
logical operation in a case where the image data about 

the periphery of the pixel of interest appertains to 
binary representation. When the image data is judged to 

appertain to an image of multivalued representation, the 
interpolated data of the pixel of interest is produced 

by a numerical operation. As a result, a 600 dpi 
picture of the same size can be printed and recorded in 

such a manner that outline sharpness and smoothness, 
which are characteristics possessed by a two-value 

image, are maintained at portions of the input 300 dpi 
image data that are two-value images while smoothness of 

the grayscale is maintained at portions of the input 300 
dpi image data that are halftone images.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming
apparatus and method for forming/recording an image
while maintaining the quality of a picture by converting
resolution of image data.Printers have recently been given a color printing
capability and have come to be utilized by users and
means for producing a variety of expressions. In
particular, color page printers using electrophotography
have become the focus of attention owing to their high-quality
printing and high-speed printing capabilities.A full-color, laser-beam printer, which is one type
of color page printer, records a multiple-value colored
image by a first process which involves performing a
first development by causing a beam to scan a
photosensitive drum in a main-scan direction, and then
transferring the image to a recording medium such as
recording paper on a transfer carrier, and by successive
second, third and fourth processes that follow the first
process.An electrophotographic color-laser beam printer is
known in which a color image is obtained generally by
these four processes using Y (yellow), M (magenta), C
(cyan) and K (black) color toners. Recent years have 
seen the practical application of printers in which
halftone image data is received from a host computer as
multiple-value information-signal data composed of, say,
eight bits per pixel, without the data being binarized
as by dithering. These printers output each pixel by
printing it in multivalued form. Printers having a
printing resolution on the order of 300 dpi (dots per
inch), 600 dpi, etc., have been developed and
manufactured.Fig. 46 is a block diagram illustrating the
construction of a color laser-beam printer according to
the prior art. As shown in Fig. 46, a host computer
201p connected to a printer 202p sends image
information, which has been created by application
software or the like, in the form of a command or data
to a controller 203p within the printer 202p via an
interface (not shown).While expanding the entered command or data to
multiple-value (e.g., eight bits) bit data corresponding
to pixels of 600 dpi in conformity with the command or
data, the controller 203p sequentially plants the data
as 600 dpi multivalued data in a buffer memory 108p and
stores one page of data. In dependence upon the process
timing of a printer engine 207p having a resolution of
600 dpi, the controller sequentially sends a 600 dpi
multiple-value image signal to the printer engine to
drive the engine in conformity with the image signal, 
thereby obtaining a color image.In recent

An image processing method for generating image data
for an image forming means, comprising:


an input step of inputting successive items of first
image data represented by a first color format which is

different from the color format suitable for image
