Process for making a contact between a capacitor 
electrode disposed in a trench and an MOS transistor 

source/drain region disposed outside the trench 

in which at least one field-oxide region (2) is 
formed in a substrate (1) to the side of the future 

source/drain region as insulation from adjacent 
active regions in the substrate (1), 
in which a trench mask is produced which defines the 
position of the trench to the side of the future 

source/drain region on the side of the field-oxide 
region (2) adjacent to the future source/drain 

region such that the trench is arranged between the 
future source/drain region and the field-oxide 

region (2), 
in which the trench mask leaves the field-oxide 
region (2) partially uncovered on the side adjacent 

to the future source/drain region, 
in which a photoresist is arranged on the surface of 
the trench mask, 
in which a first etching is carried out to produce 
the trench to a first depth in the substrate (1), 

which attacks the substrate selectively on photoresist 
and the field-oxide region (2), so that the 

trench mask covered with photoresist and the part of 
the field-oxide region (2) laid bare act as an 

etching mask, a vertical substrate edge (8) being 
laid bare at the side of the trench (11) adjacent to 

the future source/drain region, 
in which a conformal Si
3
N
4
 layer (9) is deposited  
 

after removal of the photoresist, 
in which Si
3
N
4
 spacers (10) are formed from the 
conformal Si
3
N
4
 layer (9) at the vertical edges by 
anisotropic etching and the part of the field-oxide 

region laid bare is selectively etched away to form 
the trench mask, 
in which a second etching is carried out to a second 
depth in the substrate (1), the cross section of the 

trench (11) being defined by the trench mask and the 
depth of the trench (11) by the second depth, 
in which the surface of the trench (11) is provided 
with an SiO
2
 layer (12), 
in which the Si
3
N
4
 spacers (10) are removed selectively 
with respect to SiO
2
 and Si, 
in which the capacitor electrode (13) is produced in 
the trench (11) in such a way that it covers at 

least the vertical substrate edge (8) laid bare 
during the etching, and 
in which, on the side of the trench (11) which is 
remote from the field-oxide region (2), a 

source/drain region adjoining the capacitor electrode 
(13) is produced. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the field-oxide 
region (2) is produced in a LOCOS process. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 

in which, to produce the trench mask, a first SiO
2
 
layer (3), which is thinner than the field-oxide 

region (2), is deposited on the substrate (1) provided 
with the field-oxide region (2), 
in which an Si
3
N
4
 layer (4) is deposited on the 
first SiO
2
 layer (3), 
in which a second SiO
2
 layer (5) is deposited on the 
Si
3
N
4
 layer (4), 
in which a polysilicon layer (6) is deposited on the 
second SiO
2
 layer (5), 
in which a photoresist mask (7) which defines the 
cross section of the trench parallel to the substrate 

surface is produced on the polysilicon layer  
 

(6), 
in which the polysilicon layer (6), the second SiO
2
 
layer (5), the Si
3
N
4
 layer (4) and the first SiO
2
 
layer (3) are each patterned in an anisotropic dry 

etching step using the photoresist mask (7) as 
etching mask so that the surface of the substrate 

(1) is laid bare to the side of the field-oxide 
region (2), and 
in which the photoresist mask (7) is removed after 
the first etching to produce the trench (11). 
Process according to Claim 3, in which the first 
SiO
2
 layer (3) is produced by thermal oxidation of the 
surface of the substrate (1) and in which the second SiO
2
 
layer (5) is produced by CVD deposition after decomposing 

Si(OC

H

)

 (TEOS). 
Process according to Claim 4, in which the first 
SiO
2
 layer (3) is produced with a thickness of between 
10 nm and 40 nm, the Si
3
N
4
 layer (4) with a thickness of 
between 20 nm and 60 nm, the second SiO
2
 layer (5) with 
a thickness of between 200 nm and 1,000 nm and the 

polysilicon layer (6) with a thickness of between 20 nm 
and 100 nm. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in 
which the conformal Si
3
N
4
 layer (9) is deposited with a 
thickness of between 10 nm and 100 nm to form the Si
3

spacers (10). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in 
which the Si

etching. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in 
which the first depth assumes a value of between 30 nm 

and 300 nm and the second depth a value between 2 µm and 
20 µm.
