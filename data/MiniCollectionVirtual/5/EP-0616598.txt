<ABSTRACT>
A feeder for a sheet-paper processing machine with vaccum lifter (5) to lift the sheets of paper from the stack, means for transferring the lifted sheet and taking it from the raised position above the stack to the processing unit, with potential power (16) permanently acting downwards on the vaccum lifters towards the stack, means for controlled cyclic raising of the lifters against the potential force (16), with at least one holder lug (13) on the lifter (5) with movable mechanical means fitted on the suction head to hold the lifter (5) by engaging beneath the holder lug (13). A second permanent potential force acting on the mechanical means and holding the latter back from the lifter (5) is fitted, and there are pneumatically controlled operating means to overcome the potential force operationally coupled to the mechanical means.
