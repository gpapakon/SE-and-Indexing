<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a leaky coaxial radio-frequency cable having openings in the outer conductor (6) which are constructed as slots (7) arranged essentially at right angles to the cable axis, sections having a periodically recurring slot configuration are provided along the cable, which sections either have a different period length with the same number of slots per period length, and/or have a different number of slots per period length, with the same period length.

Radiating coaxial high-frequency cable having apertures
in the outer conductor which are formed as slots

disposed substantially perpendicularly to the cable
axis, characterized in that there are provided along

the cable length sections which have a periodically
repeating slot configuration and which differ in the

period length with a constant number of slots per
period length and/or in the number of slots per period

length with constant period length.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 1 in which the
sections differ in the period length with a constant

number of slots per period length, characterized in
that the period length decreases along the cable viewed

from the feedpoint of the cable.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 2 characterized
in that the period length decreases along the cable in

uniform steps.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the number of slots increases

with decreasing period length.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterized in that sections

having a constant number of slots per period length
with varying period length and sections having a

constant period length with a varying number of slots
per period length alternate with one another along the

cable.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterized in that, viewed from

the feedpoint of the cable, sections of constant period 
length with an increasing number of slots which are

followed in turn towards the cable end by slots of
decreasing period length having a constant number of

slots adjoin periodically repeating sections of
decreasing period length having a constant number of

slots.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterized by a plastics material

tube which is disposed concentrically with respect to
the inner conductor and is held in its position with

respect to the inner conductor by spacers and which
supports the tape-type outer conductor having slots.
High-frequency cable according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the tape edges of the outer

conductor extend in the axial direction of the cable
and overlap one another.
