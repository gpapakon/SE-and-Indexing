<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical
communications, more particularly to components for optical
circuits intended to improve bonding, fixing and mounting of
optical waveguide with optical fiber and semiconductor
device in a module using optical waveguide, and a method of
manufacturing the same.The advance of optical communications is dramatic
recently, and applications and practical use are promoted in
public communications, CATV, computer networks, etc. From
the viewpoint of components, however, there are problems for
reduction of size and enhancement of mass producibility in
order to spread more widely. For example, an optical
transmitter-receiver comprises a laser driving circuit, a
photo detector, a demodulating circuit, and optical fibers. 
It is required to adjust, assemble, and mount these optical
and electrical components at high precision. Many
components and assembling processes are needed. Further
distribution of optical communication systems demands
smaller size, multiple functions, higher degree of
integration, and lower cost of components for optical
circuits. In particular, for installation of subscriber
optical communication systems, reduction of size and
lowering of cost of components for optical circuits are
important subjects.On the other hand, required functions of subscriber
system include, among others, the functions of wavelength
division multiplexing and bi-directional transmission by
making use of the broad band properties of optical
communications. For integration of functions, several
optical circuit submounts using optical waveguide have been
proposed. For example, according to a proposed optical
module,a silica-based optical waveguide is formed on a silicon
submount by flame-hydrolysis deposition, and further metal
electrodes are wired, and semiconductor devices and electric
circuits are mounted, and optical fibers are arranged and
connected on the submount forming V-grooves.In such conventional components for optical circuits, 
the submount mounting optical waveguides, light emitting
devices, light receiving devices, and electrode wiring is
separate from the submount for fixing optical fibers. To
bond the optical waveguide and optical fibers at low loss,
it is required to adjust, assemble and fix at a precision of
1 micro-m or less. For fabrication of submount for fixing
optical fibers, selective etching of silicon submount, and
V-groove method by cutting ceramic submount are employed.
They have their own problems in processing precision and
mass producibility. In the
