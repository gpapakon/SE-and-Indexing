which key portions (2) have been omitted. Each rubber stamp has an 
image (3) which corresponds to a respective key portion in the text so

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to games and educational material for children. 
More specifically it relates to a text wherein the reader provides part of 
the story by adding missing text, based on clues contained in the 
preceding and subsequent portions of the text. It is known to provide stories wherein words are omitted and replaced 
by graphics which suggest what the missing words should be. More 
recent versions of this concept include books wherein missing text is 
added by the reader, typically a child, by way of affixing a sticker bearing 
the appropriate image into a gap in the text provided for this purpose. 
While these books are popular, they have the disadvantage of being 
relatively expensive.  According to the invention, a reading kit comprises at least one sheet of 
text, a plurality of rubber stamps, and at least one ink pad; wherein the 
text consists of a storyline of which key portions have been omitted, and 
each rubber stamp contains an image corresponding to respective key 
portions of the text such that, in use, a reader may complete the story 
by stamping the appropriate image onto the sheet of text using the 
appropriate rubber stamp and ink pad. Typically the storyline would be suitable for young children who are 
learning to read. The text may be selected to be suitable for the 
entertainment or education of the reader, or for both purposes. Ink 
pads may be incorporated into the individual rubber stamps, or a 
separate ink pad may be provided which is adapted to be used to ink-up 
all of the stamps. Figure 1shows an example of text in accordance with the 
invention; Figure 2shows a selection of images for use with the text of 
Figure 1; and Figure 3shows the text of Figure 1 in which certain portions 
have been completed using the images of Figure 2. Referring initially to Figure 1, a sheet of text 1 contains a storyline 
having a series of gaps 2 therein. The text is so set out that the text 
preceding and following each gap 2 suggests the nature of the missing 
text. Figure 2 shows a plurality of images 3 selected to complete the storyline 
by their insertion into the gaps in the text. These images are contained 
on the faces of a plurality of rubber stamps depicted by dotted lines 4. 
In use, the reader of the text may, at each gap in the text, decide the 
nature of the missing text, select a rubber stamp bearing an image the 
corresponding to the missing text, ink this stamp using an ink pad 5 and 
stamp the appropriate image in the corresponding gap in the text. Figure 3
