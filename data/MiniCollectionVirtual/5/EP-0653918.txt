<ABSTRACT>
An improved cardiac pacemaker system of the kind that includes an oxygen sensor (22) implantable into a patient's blood stream along with one or two electrical conductors (38, 42) for use in sensing heart beat activity, and in selectively applying packing pulses to the heart muscle. In an embodiment having just one implantable conductor, the oxygen sensor is integrated into the conductor, while in an embodiment having two implantable conductors, the oxygen sensor either is integrated into one of the conductors or is connected between the two conductors, in parallel with the heart muscle. In both cases, the oxygen sensor is selectively used without adversely affecting either heart beat sensing or pacing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
implantable cardiac pacemakers and, more particularly,
to cardiac pacemakers having oxygen sensors of the
kind that determine oxygen content by measuring the
blood's reflectivity.The cardiac pacemaker is perhaps one of the
best known electronic marvels of modern medicine, and
the implantation of a pacemaker in a patient has
become almost a routine operation. The pacemaker
pulses the patient's heart muscle continuously over an
extended period of time, or in the case of demand
pacemakers, monitors the heart muscle's natural
operation and provides stimulating pulses only when
the heart muscle skips a beat. Pacemakers allow
patients with heart problems that otherwise would have
been fatal or incapacitating to resume relatively
normal lives.The modern pacemaker is a highly complex
device, capable of event sensing, two-way telemetry,
and sensing and pacing in either or both of the atrium
and the ventricle of the heart muscle. Such
pacemakers may be finely tuned by the physician
subsequent to implantation, and the parameters
adjusted to provide optimum pacing performance.Despite the sophistication of such pacemakers,
a major difference remains between the healthy heart
muscle and a paced heart muscle--namely, the response
to activity or exercise. Variations in the cardiac
stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance occur
in the cardiovascular system due to physiological 
stresses such as exercise, temperature changes,
postural changes, emotion, hypoglycemia, Valsalva
maneuvers, etc.To maintain adequate perfusion pressure and
cardiac output under these stresses, it is necessary
to adjust heart rate. The healthy heart muscle might
beat at 60 or fewer beats per minute during repose or
sleep, and at 120 or more beats per minute during
strenuous exercise, for example. The heart muscle
paced by a pacemaker that is non-rate responsive will
typically beat at a constant rate of approximately 70
beats per minute.It will be appreciated that the
constantly-paced heart muscle will supply more blood
than is needed during sleep, and might even prevent
the patient from sleeping restfully. Even more
seriously, patients paced at 70 beats per minute
experience substantial difficulty in engaging in
strenuous activity. Even a moderate level of activity
such as walking will cause difficulty in some
patients. It is apparent that a demand pacemaker
whose rate varies in response to physiological need
represents a highly desirable device that will enable
patients requiring pacemakers to lead
