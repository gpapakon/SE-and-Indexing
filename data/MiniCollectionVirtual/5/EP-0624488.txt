<ABSTRACT>
Electronic device for adjusting and limiting the speed of the motor 
vehicle wherein said device is installed, comprising, related to 

each other, the following elements: 

one or more sensors (SV) to detect the motor vehicle speed (V); 
actuating means (MA) to modify the power produced by the engine in 
order to limit the motor vehicle speed (V); 
one logic unit (UL), preferably a micro-processor unit, which 
leads the actuating means (MA), in response to a comparison between 

the maximum speed value (VM) inserted in its memory (M) and the 
speed value (V) detected by the sensors (SV); 
a control panel (DS) which allows the user to enter the memory 
(M) of the logic unit (UL), preferably by means of at least a key-word 

or an equivalent means, in order to modify the maximum speed 
value (VM) recorded therein and/or the key-word and in order to 

receive any possible information or message from the logic unit 
(UL).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic device which allows the user 
to control the motor vehicle speed wherein the device is installed 
and to limit said speed to a maximum value, fixed from time to time 
according to the kind of road (urban streets or country roads, 
speed-limited routes, etc.), the environmental conditions (rain, 
slimy asphalt, etc.) and to the psycho-physical state of the 
driver, which can be influenced by several factors, among which is, 
for instance, its age: said maximum speed can be modified by the 
user (if he owns a valid "access" key) in order to fit it to 
specific situations and/or necessities. Such device is known from US-A-3 878 915.  
 The features of present motor vehicles, which are more and more "on 
the razor's edge", increase the difficulties of driving, since the 
drivers are not always in a psycho-physical condition suitable to 
drive said vehicles with the necessary ability and care, not to 
become a potential danger for themselves and for the others. Therefore, it seems suitable and advantageous to provide a vehicle 
with a device which allows (the owner or another enabled person) to 
limit the maximum speed before entrusting the vehicle to a driver 
who is at least potentially inexperienced (as, e.g., a beginner who 
drives his car and/or the car of a third person, usually the father, 
said car being often too powerful for the driving ability of the 
beginner) as well as to enter said device in order to modify and/or 
switch off said speed limit (in the previous example, when it is 
the third person who drives his car). Beside enhancing active and passive road safety, a device for 
limiting the vehicle speed can be advantageously used in order to 
avoid fines and/or accessory penalties (such as, for instance, 
suspension or revocation of the driving licence) foreseen by the new 
highway code if the maximum speed allowed is exceeded; said 
advantage can be particularly interesting if the owner entrusts any 
other person, e.g. his employees, with his car or if he rents it: in 
both cases fines which have not been immediately paid by the driver  
 
will have to be paid by the owner, with scarce or no chances for the 
owner to be refunded by the responsible driver. In order to be fully effective, said device for limiting the vehicle 
speed must provide one or more access key-words (mechanical and/or 
electronic) which allow only a limited amount of persons (e.g. the 
car owner or an employee of the firm charged to entrust the vehicle 
to other employees or to
