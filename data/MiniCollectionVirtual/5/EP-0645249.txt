<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drive circuit for a thermal printer with a thermal print head (1) with a series of electrically drivable heating elements (14), with a microprocessor (2) which transmits data to be printed to a register (13) which is assigned to the thermal print head (1). In order to increase the printing speed, a buffer (15) which is connected to the microprocessor (2) by means of a parallel data line and a separate charge state monitoring circuit (17) are proposed, which charge state monitoring circuit (17) is connected to the buffer (15) and permits data to be transmitted from the buffer (15) into the register (13) when a defined quantity of data has been written into the buffer (15) by the microprocessor (2). Alternatively, or additionally, it is recommended that a pulse generator (9) and a stepping motor driver (10) be connected between the output of the microprocessor (2) and the stepping motor (11) in order to drive the counterpressure roller (12).

A control circuit with a microprocessor (2) for a
thermal printing machine having a thermal print head (1)

with a line of electrically drivable heating elements
(14), said microprocessor transferring data to be printed

into a register (13) which is associated with the thermal
print head (1) and drives driver circuits connected to

the heating elements (14), said register (13) receiving
the data in serial form and said microprocessor (2) being

connected to a buffer storage (15) via a parallel data
line, said buffer storage (15) being also connected to a

separate load state monitoring circuit (17) causing data
to be transferred from the buffer storage (15) into the

register (13) when the data written into the buffer
storage (15) by the microprocessor (2) has reached a defined

quantity, 
characterized in that
, simultaneously
with the transfer of data from the buffer storage (15)

into the register (13), the microprocessor (2) writes
data into the buffer storage (15) as soon as capacity

becomes available in the buffer storage.
The control circuit according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the defined quantity of data necessary
for causing the transmission of data from the buffer

storage (15) into the register (13) is lower than the
quantity of data necessary for driving the whole line of

heating elements (14).
The control circuit according to any one of the
claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in tha
t the microprocessor
(2) does not initially write data into the buffer storage 

(15) following the transmission of data for driving a
complete line of the heating elements (14), starting instead

with the transmission of the data of the subsequent
line after at least part of the data is transferred from

the buffer storage (15) to the register (13).
The control circuit according to any one of the
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the buffer storage
(15) is a first-in/first-out storage.
The control circuit according to any one of the
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the microprocessor
(2) and/or the load state monitoring circuit (17) include(s)

an output connected to an input of the print
head (1) for a print release signal (e) for activating

the heating elements (14) via a circuit (7) generating a
signal comprised of an initial continuous pulse followed

by rectangular pulses of a higher frequency.
The control circuit according to claim 5,

characterized in that
 the thermal print head (1) includes
a temperature sensor (8) connected to the microprocessor

of the pulses and/or the pulse spaces of the circuit (7)

in dependence upon the output signal of the temperature
sensor (8).
The control circuit according to claim 5 or 6,

characterized in that
 the microprocessor (2) varies the
duration of the pulses and/or the pulse spaces in dependence

upon the printing speed and/or the type of the
printed paper.
