<ABSTRACT>
An electronic seal comprises a housing (12), a cord (14) with one end fixed to the 
housing (12) and a free end which can be passed through a door catch or the like and 

releasably connected to the housing (12), an electronic circuit within the housing (12) 
arranged to generate one of a number of unique codes when a switch (70) in the 

housing (12) is actuated on connection or disconnection of the cord (14) to or from 
the housing (12) and a display device (18) which can display the unique code. The 

cord (14) has a series of regularly spaced enlargements (36), and the interior of the 
housing (12) has a plurality of teeth (4()) arranged so that when a length of cord (14) 

at its free end is inserted into the housing (12) the enlargements (36) can fit between 
the teeth (4()) to hold the cord (14) against withdrawal from the housing (12). A slide 

(16) is movable in the housing (12) between an open position in which the cord (14) 
can be inserted into and withdrawn from the housing (12) and a locking position in 

which it retains the enlargements (36) in engagement with the teeth (40). The switch 
(70) has an actuating member (72) projecting into the space between two of the teeth 

(40), so that the switch is actuated when the length of cord (14) is moved into or out 
of engagement with the teeth (40). The fixed end of the cord (14) is connected 

permanently to the housing (12) by engagement of enlargements (36) on the cord (14) 
with a further set of teeth in the housing (12). The cord (14) is held in engagement 

with the further teeth by the slide (16), when the slide (16) is in the open or locking 
position. The slide (16) is movable from a third position in which the fixed end of 

the cord (14) can be inserted into the housing (12) before the seal is first used, but is 
then prevented from being moved back to the third position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic seals.More particularly, the invention relates to an electronic seal comprising a housing, a
flexible element extending from the housing and having a free end which can be
passed through a door catch or the like, means for releasably connecting the free end
of the flexible element to the housing, an electronic circuit within the housing
arranged to generate one of a number of unique codes on receipt of an electrical signal
and to store the generated code, display means on the housing adapted to display the
generated code, and a switch in the housing actuated on connection and/or
disconnection of the flexible element to the housing to provide an electrical signal to
actuate the electronic circuit.European patent 0 193 297 describes such a seal, designed principally for use with
goods vehicles or freight containers. The specific embodiment described in the patent
has a housing adapted to be fixed to the exterior of the door or shutter of the vehicle
or container, and a flexible cable, e.g. of multi-stranded wire, permanently fixed at
one end to the housing and having at its free end a head which fits into a recess of
the housing and which is trapped in the recess by a movable catch member on the
housing. A switch coupled to the catch member provides a signal to the electronic
circuitry in the housing when the catch member is moved to lock the head of the cable
in the recess. The described seal is of robust construction and has a relatively long
life, and therefore is particularly suitable for use with goods vehicles or freight
containers. It is not however particularly suitable for uses where a small and
inexpensive seal is required, for example, in the airline industry, where small
disposable seals are used to secure bonded goods on aircraft, such as bar boxes and
high value items for purchase by passengers in flight.It is an object of this invention to provide an electronic seal which can be made small
and relatively inexpensive. In accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided an electronic seal
of the kind set forth, in which the flexible element is a cord having a series of
regularly spaced enlargements, and the means for releasably connecting the free end
of the cord to the housing comprises a passage in the housing into which a length of
the cord can be inserted, a plurality of teeth in the housing adapted to fit between
enlargements of the cord, so that when the length of cord is inserted into the housing
each enlargement of the length can fit

<CLAIMS>
An electronic seal (10) comprising a housing (12), a flexible element (14) extending from the
housing and having a free end (28) which can be passed through a door catch or the like,

means for releasably connecting the free end of the flexible element to the housing,
an electronic circuit (20) within the housing arranged to generate one of a number of

unique codes on receipt of an electrical signal and to store the generated code, display
means (18) on the housing adapted to display the generated code, and a switch (70) on the

housing actuated on connection and/or disconnection of the flexible element to the
housing to provide an electrical signal to actuate the electronic circuit, characterised in that the

flexible element is a cord (30) having a series of regularly spaced enlargements (36), and the
means for releasably connecting the free end of the cord to the housing comprises a

passage in the housing into which a length of the cord can be inserted, a plurality of
teeth (40) in the housing adapted to fit between enlargements (36) of the cord, so that when the

length of cord is inserted into the housing each enlargement of the length can fit
between two adjacent teeth to hold the cord against withdrawal from the housing, and

a slide (16) movable in the housing between a first position in which the cord can be
inserted and removed from the passage, and a second position in which the slide

retains the enlargements in engagement with the teeth, and the switch has an actuating
member (72) projecting into the space between two of the teeth, so as to be engaged by

one of the enlargements on the cord when it is engaged between the teeth, so that the
switch is actuated when the length of cord is moved into and/or out of engagement

with the teeth.
An electronic seal (10) as claimed in Claim 1, in which the flexible element
comprises a series of balls (36) of plastics moulded onto a plastics cord 38 to form the

enlargements.
An electronic seal as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which the housing (20) is
generally in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped, and the passage extends between

openings (28), (32) in two opposite side walls of the housing, so that the flexible element can
be inserted from either side of the housing. 
An electronic seal as claimed in Claim 3, in which the passage is formed
between a wall extending between the side walls of the housing (42) and a wall formed on

the slide (50), the teeth (40) projecting from the first wall (42), so that on movement of the slide
from the first to the second position, the second wall (50) can engage the enlargements of

the flexible element (14) to move them into engagement with the teeth (40).
An electronic seal as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the slide (16) has
an arm formed with a detent (62) which is resiliently biased to move into engagement with

an abutment surface (68) on movement of the slide (16) to the second position, the engagement
holding the slide in the second position, and the arm being movable manually to move

the detent (62) out of engagement with the abutment surface (68) to allow it to be moved from
the second position.
An electronic seal as claimed in Claim 5, in which the arm has two projections (54), (62)
which, when the detent (62) is in engagement with the abutment surface (68), project through

respective aperture 56 in the housing (12) to hold the arm against movement until the
projections (54), 62) are simultaneously depressed to release them from engagement with the

aperture (56), the outer ends of the projections forming buttons (54) by which they can be
manually depressed, the projections being spaced apart to avoid inadvertent movement

of the arm.
An electronic seal as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, in which the arm has a
grip portion (54) which projects through an opening (56) in the housing (12) and which can be

gripped by the user to enable the arm to be moved to release engagement of the detent (62)
from the abutment surface (68) and to enable the slide (16) to be moved between the first and

second positions.
An electronic seal as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the fixed end (26)
of the flexible element (14) is retained in the housing (12) by engagement of the enlargements (36)

on a length of the element at the fixed end with a further set of teeth formed on the
slide (16) the further set of teeth engaging the enlargements when the slide is in each of

the said two positions, and the slide being movable to a third position in which the 
teeth on the slide are withdrawn from engagement with the flexible element, so that

the flexible element can be inserted into the housing.
An electronic seal as claimed in Claim 8, in which the housing (12) has a second
passage (30) to receive the length of flexible element at the fixed end when it is engaged

with the further set of teeth, the further passage extending between openings in two
opposite side walls of the housing, so that the flexible element can be inserted from

either side of the housing.
An electronic seal as claimed in Claim 8 or Claim 9, in which there is
provided in the housing a spring-loaded locking element (90) which bears against the slide (16)

when the slide is in the third position and which, on movement of the slide away from
the third position after insertion of the fixed end of the flexible element, moves to a

position in which it prevents movement of the slide back to the third position.
