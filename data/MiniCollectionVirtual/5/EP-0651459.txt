<ABSTRACT>
A diode detector is integrated into a microstrip patch antenna (1). 
Tuning and matching of the detector are accomplished by adjusting the geometry of 

the patch. Cost, power consumption, losses, and spurious responses are reduced. 
The antenna may be adapted to a mixer, video dtector, i.f. detector, or audio detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to radio antennas, 
particularly to microwave antennas, and most particularly 
to microstrip (or "patch") microwave antennas. Microstrip Antennas, D. M. Pozar, Proceedings of the 
IEEE, Vol. 80 No. 1, January, 1992, page 79 et seq 
(hereinafter, "Pozar"). The physical size of an antenna is proportional to the 
wavelength of the signal it is intended to transmit or 
receive. As higher frequencies, with their shorter 
wavelengths, have been exploited, smaller antennas have 
become possible. The exploitation of frequencies in the 
GHz. range has led to the development and use of the 
microstrip antenna, which Pozar describes as "a metallic 
patch printed on a thin, grounded dielectric substrate" 
(Pozar at page 79). Such antennas can be inexpensive and 
compact. Such inexpensive and compact antennas, in turn, have 
led to a broadening of the field of devices in which radio 
communication is used, such as employee badges that 
transmit the employee's identity or electronic shelf labels 
that receive and display price information dynamically. 
Since such devices might be required in large quantities, 
it is desirable that each unit be inexpensive; since such 
devices must operate portably or remotely, it is desirable 
that they consume little power. Prior-art devices incorporating microstrip antennas  
 
employ conventional means for connecting the antennas to 
receiving or transmitting apparatus; the present invention 
provides a detector integrated into the microstrip antenna, 
enabling video, if, af, or dc signal to be obtained 
directly from the patch. This enhances compactness and 
lowers the cost and power consumption. It is thus a general object of the present invention 
to provide improved patch antennas. It is a particular object of the present invention to 
provide patch antennas from which detected signal may be 
directly obtained. It is a more particular object of the present 
invention to provide compact, inexpensive patch antennas 
from which detected signal may be directly obtained. In accordance with the present invention, these 
objectives are achieved by a patch antenna having a diode 
detector integrated into the patch. The patch is 
physically constructed so as to tune the detector itself, 
or to tune the detecting antenna with adjacent components 
of the receiving or transmitting system. The novel features of construction and operation of 
the invention will be more clearly apparent during the 
course of the following description and the appended 
drawings,
