<ABSTRACT>
A contact guide member (147) extends transversely to the contact fingers
(49) on the contact carrier (47) of electrical switching apparatus (1) and has spaced

openings (149) through which the contact fingers (49) extend and are held in spaced
relation. The contact finger guide member (147) is positioned to isolate the arc toes (55)

adjacent the free ends (53) of the contact fingers (49) from the main contacts (41) and the
contact springs (79) in order to protect the latter items from the arc gases and debris

generated during arcing. The openings (149) in the contact finger guide member (147)
are elongated to permit differentially pivoting of the contact fingers (49), but not axial

movement. The contact finger guide member (147) slides in a pocket (151) molded in the
end face (153) of the contact carrier (47) and is captured by and moves with the contact

fingers (49).

to such apparatus with multiple contact fingers and to a contact finger guide which 
maintains spacing between the contact fingers during current interruption and blocks 
passage of arcing gasses back along the contact fingers. Electrical switching apparatus for power distribution systems includes 
devices such as, for instance, circuit breakers, network protectors, transfer switches and  
 
disconnect switches. A common type of power air circuit breaker has a molded casing 
housing multiple pole assemblies all driven by a common operating mechanism. Each 
pole includes a contact arm carrier pivoted by the operating mechanism between open and 
closed positions. The contact arm carriers support contact arms having movable contacts 
which engage stationary contacts with the contact arm carrier in
