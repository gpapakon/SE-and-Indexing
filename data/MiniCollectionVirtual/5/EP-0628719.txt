<ABSTRACT>
A charging circuit (2) charges a first capacitor (26) to a first 
voltage and a 

second capacitor (28), via a potential divider (27,29,30) to a second 
voltage smaller than the first voltage. A self-trigger circuit (29-32) 

repeatedly 
triggers a thyristor (33) which discharges the second capacitor (28) into 

the primary winding of a pulse transformer (34) whose secondary 
winding is connected across a diode (35) in series with the first 

capacitor (26) between output terminals (36,37). The discharge of the 
second capacitor (28) initiates whereby the first capacitor (26) 

maintains the discharge in an igniter plug. Thus reducing the voltage 
stress over the trigger thyristor (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ignition apparatus. Such an apparatus 
is suitable for use with a gas turbine engine. Existing solid state ignition designs have difficulty in achieving high 
levels of output current (over 1,500 amps) at high temperatures (over 
125Â°C) due to both static (leakage current) and dynamic (switching) 
losses in the solid state switch. FR 2 611 327 discloses an ignition arrangement in which the 
maintaining current for discharge through a spark plug is provided by a 
voltage doubler supplied by the secondary winding 11 of a self-oscillating 
inverter. A further secondary winding 12 is provided for 
charging a second energy store 24 which is capable of being discharged 
by a thyristor 26 through the primary winding 14 of a transformer so as 
to breakdown the spark gap. Capacitor 18 then maintains the discharge. 
The secondary winding is connected directly across the output terminals 
of the circuit. US 3 505 563 discloses an ignition apparatus having a storage capacitor 
which stores charge for creating and maintaining a discharge through an 
igniter plug. The capacitor is connected via a spark gap to the igniter 
plug. The spark gap has a voltage rating such that the voltage across the 
capacitor when fully charged is insufficient to break down the spark gap.  
 The spark gap has a trigger terminal which is connected to a voltage 
pulse producing circuit. This circuit comprises a transformer whose 
secondary is connected to the trigger electrode of the spark gap. A 
capacitor is periodically discharged by a thyristor into the primary 
winding of the transformer. The output pulse produced by the secondary 
winding of the transformer is sufficient to initiate breakdown of the spark 
gap so as to control discharge of the capacitor through the igniter plug. Such an arrangement requires the use of a spark gap having a separate 
trigger terminal. Thus, although the stress on the thyristor is reduced by 
employing a voltage step-up transformer, this arrangement is more 
complicated and expensive. Further, the capacitor is still required to be 
charged to a voltage sufficient to initiate discharge in the igniter plug. WO93/04279 discloses an ignition system employing two energy 
sources, one to create a spark, and the other to sustain the spark. The 
system increases ignition efficiency by increasing the power dissipated at 
a spark gap. Maximum power transfer is achieved via impedance 
matching between a transformer of the ignition system to the surface gap 
spark plug. US 5 032
