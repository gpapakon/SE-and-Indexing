<ABSTRACT>
The fluid-tight coupling device is intended to be interposed between a tube with a cylindrical outside surface and a rigid connector body equipped with external retaining means and with a planar annular front face for fluid-tight coupling at the mouth of a central passage. It includes an internal ring (14) made of an elastomeric material exhibiting a cylindrical central passage substantially of the same inside diameter as the outside diameter of the cylindrical tube (2) to be coupled, and a conical outside surface (16), whereas a thin clamping ring (12) is interposed between the elastomeric ring (14) and a retaining ring (7). Application to the fluid-tight joining of pipes (tubes) of different diameters using at least one standard element in the coupling device.

A coupling device for a fluid-tight connection
between a tube (2) with an outer cylindrical surface and

a rigid coupling body (1, 5) provided with outer
retaining means (3), said device comprising an inner ring

(14) in an elastomer material, an intermediate ring (12)
in a rigid material, an outer ring (7) for retention on

the said connector body (1, 5), these three rings being
concentric and having frusto-conical contact surfaces

between each other, said intermediate ring (12) being
provided, at the small diameter end of its frusto-conical

portion, with engaging means (13) designed to co-operate
with said tube (2), and said outer retaining ring (7)

having, at the major diameter base of its frusto-conical
portion, inner retaining means (8), adapted to co-operate

with said connector body (1, 5), characterised in that
said inner ring (14) has, firstly, at said major diameter

base (18) of its frusto-conical portion at least one
projecting annular sealing rib (19) co-operating with a

flat annular sealing face (18) of the coupling head (1)
and, secondly, at the periphery of said base (18) of its

frusto-conical portion, a small projecting collar (20),
on 
which the rear end surface (21) of said intermediate
ring (12) bears.
The device according to claim 1, characterised in
that said intermediate ring (12) has an axial slot (23,

24).
The device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that said intermediate ring (12) has, on

its conical portion, at least one fold or undulation (29)
oriented axially with respect to said frusto-conical

surface (11).
A range of coupling devices according to any one
of claims 1 to 3, for connecting cylindrical tubes of 

different outer diameters, characterised in that all the
types of coupler of the range include the same outer

retaining ring (7), said inner elastomer ring (14) and
intermediate ring (12) each being adapted to the outer

diameter of a cylindrical tube to be coupled (2).
