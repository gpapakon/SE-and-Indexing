<ABSTRACT>
An infrared intrusion detector, consisting of infrared-sensitive sensors with pyro-electrical sensor elements, which detects the infrared radiation emanating from a space to be monitored, in that the radiation passes through an entry window and impinges, via focusing mirror surfaces, on the sensor elements. The disturbing (stray) light outside the useful radiation band is suppressed by filtering at the entry window, at an optical transmission filter and by scattering at suitable rough surfaces of the focusing mirrors. The infrared intrusion detector has, due to this disturbing light filtering, an increased strength with respect to disturbing light and an increased immunity against false alarms.

Infrared intruder detector comprising a
radiation-impermeable housing with an infrared-radiation-permeable

entrance window and with at least one infrared
sensor, disposed within the housing, with at least two

radiation-sensitive pyroelectric sensor elements, over
which an infrared-radiation-permeable optical filter is

disposed and onto which the radiation emanating from the
room to be monitored is focused by a plurality of mirror

surfaces, characterized in that the focusing mirror
surfaces exhibit a surface roughness in such a manner

that the radiation within the wavelength range of 6 to 15
micrometres is focused by the mirror surfaces onto the

infrared sensor elements and the radiation of wavelengths
below 3 micrometres is diffusely scattered by the mirror

surfaces.
Infrared intruder detector according to Patent
Claim 1, characterized in that the focusing mirror

surfaces exhibit a surface roughness in such a manner
that the specular reflection within the wavelength range

of 6 to 15 micrometres is more than 50% and within the
wavelength range of 0.4 to 3 micrometres is less than

90%.
Infrared intruder detector according to Patent
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the ratio of the

specular reflection coefficient within the wavelength
range of 6 to 15 micrometres to the specular reflection

coefficient within the wavelength range of 0.4 to 3
micrometres is greater than 1:1.
Infrared intruder detector according to Patent
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the focusing mirror 

surfaces exhibit a regular surface structure.
Infrared intruder detector according to one of
Patent Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the regular

surface structure has been produced by a direct laser
beam inscription process on a diecasting tool intended

for the mirror production.
Infrared intruder detector according to one of
Patent Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the mirror

surfaces are formed of aluminium, nickel or chromium.
Infrared intruder detector according to Patent
Claim 1, characterized in that the radiation-permeable

entrance window exhibits a surface roughness on at least
one of its surfaces, in such a manner that the radiation

within the wavelength range of 6 to 15 micrometres is
transmitted without impediment and the radiation within

the wavelength range of 0.4 to 3 micrometres is diffusely
scattered at the rough surface.
