<ABSTRACT>
A turbine consisting of a central rotor (20) connected with a shaft 
(10) and a plurality of annular stators (30,50,70) and annular rotors 

(40,60). The central rotor (20) is formed as a hollow frustum of right 
circular cone so that it has an inner side and an outer side wherein a 

number of curved channels (204,205) are formed. The shaft (10) is 
axially inserted through the central rotor (20) and rotatably supported 

by means of at least one thrust bearing. Each annular stator or rotor 
has an outer side and an inner side wherein a plurality of curved 

channels (204,205) are formed. The central rotor (20) is sealably 
mounted in the annular stators or rotors. Driving gas flows through the 

curved channels (204,205) formed in the central rotor (20) and the 
curved channels (402,602) formed in the annular stators or rotors so 

that the central rotor rotates in an opposite direction relative to the 
annular stators or rotors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine consisting of a 
combustor and a turbine and, more particularly, to a turbine 
used in an engine. A rotary engine is known as utilizing a rotor which is 
enclosed in a chamber and rotated by an expanding ignited 
gas to convert heat energy into mechanical energy in order 
to perform work. In a single-rotating engine, a plurality of rotors 
respectively rotate at a certain angular velocity and the 
center of its rotation does not move. A typical example is 
the Malloy engine (United States) the rotor of which is 
divided by a number of vanes and rotates eccentrically in 
the chamber. In an oscillatory-rotating engine, a plurality of 
rotors respectively rotate about the center of rotating at a 
varying angular velocity, the chamber volumes change as the 
rotors come close to one another or move away from one 
another. A typical example of the oscillatory-rotating 
engine is the Kauertz engine. In a planetary rotating engine, a rotor rotates in a 
closed chamber which makes a planetary motion. A typical 
example of the planetary rotating engine is the Wankel 
engine installed in Mazda sport cars. However, each of the above-mentioned rotary engines 
includes four strokes during one cycle in the enclosed 
space: intake, compression, power (or combustion), and 
exhaust. Apex seals or blades are necessary for separating  
 
the four strokes. Motor oil is also necessary for sealing 
and lubricating interfaces between the rotors and stators. 
Such a structure solves problems of motion conversion, but, 
induces disadvantages, e.g., mechanical friction, combustion 
inefficiency, and exhaust gas pollution. German Patent DE-A-14 26 835 discloses a turbine 
including a central rotor enclosed in a drum enclosed in a 
housing. A plurality of vanes project radially outwardly 
from the central rotor. A plurality of vanes project 
radially inwardly from the drum. Steam can flow past the 
vanes in order to rotate the central rotor and the drum in 
opposite directions. The central rotor and the drum can 
both transmit power. However, this turbine is complicated 
in structure and bulky in size. It is the purpose of this invention, therefore, to 
mitigate or obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks in the 
manner set forth in the detailed description of the 
preferred embodiment. It is an object of this invention to provide a turbine 
which does not use apex seals or dividers, in order to 
reduce mechanical friction. It is another object of this invention to provide a 
turbine which
