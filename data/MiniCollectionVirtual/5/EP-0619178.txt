<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layered film material having a structure wherein a protective layer, a composite film comprising a polyvinyl alcohol 
film or a film of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer saponificate and a silicon oxide deposition layer formed on the former, 

and a heat-sealable polyolefin layer are laminated. In this case, each of the layers is transparent and the silicon oxide layer is disposed 
on the side of the protective layer. The protective layer and the composite film, and the composite film and the heat-sealable 

polyolefin layer are laminated by an adhesive layer, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging multilayered
film material. More particularly, it is concerned with a
multilayered film material that is transparent, has
superior gas barrier properties and water-vapor barrier
properties, and is suited for the packaging of articles
such as medical supplies liable to be affected by oxygen
or water vapor and which must be seen through packages.As filmy packaging materials having superior gas
barrier properties and water-vapor barrier properties,
widely used are packaging materials comprised of a
polyolefin film and laminated thereto an aluminum foil
having barrier properties to oxygen and water vapor, resin
film materials formed of polyethylene terephthalate,
polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamide, an
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer saponified product or the
like, or laminated film materials thereof.The filmy packaging materials making use of aluminum
foil, however, are not transparent, and hence there has
been a disadvantage that their contents can not be
visually seen from the outside when filmy packages are 
prepared using such materials. When packages are formed
from such filmy packaging materials, it is substantially
impossible to employ a process other than cold forming,
and hence there has been another disadvantage that the
restriction on the forming process imposes a limitation to
the shape of packages. When filmy packaging materials
having been used are thermally disposed, there is still
another disadvantage that oxides of aluminum foil turn
into lumps and remain as residues of thermal disposal.As for the resin film materials having gas barrier
properties and water-vapor barrier properties or the
laminated film materials thereof, they are transparent,
can be formed by various methods and has a high freedom of
shapes, but have achieved no satisfactory gas barrier
properties or water-vapor barrier properties to medical
supplies which are very liable to undergo changes of
properties because of oxygen or water vapor. More
specifically, the medical supplies very liable to undergo
changes of properties require very high gas barrier
properties as specified by an oxygen transmission of not
more than 0.1 cc/(m2·24hrs·atm) in an environment of 25°C
and 70%RH, and very high water-vapor barrier properties as
specified by a water vapor transmission of not more than
0.2 g/(m2·24hrs) in an environment of 40°C and 90%RH. It
has been impossible for the above film materials to meet 
such requirements. For example, resin film materials
comprising polyvinyl

A process of producing a multilayered film material for a package,
comprising the steps of:


(a) providing a composite film (2) comprised of a base film
(2a) and a 40-200nm (400-2000 angstrom) thick silicon oxide deposited

layer (2b) formed thereon, the base film (2a) comprised of
a polyvinyl alcohol film or an ethylene/vinyl acetate

copolymer saponified product film;
(b) coating an adhesive (4) on the silicon oxide deposited
layer (2b) of the composite film (2);
(c) laminating a protective layer (1),
forming the external side of the package,

on the surface of the
adhesive coated silicon oxide layer (2b), by dry

lamination;
(d) coating an adhesive (4) on the base film (2a) of the
composite film (2); and
(e) laminating a heat-sealable polyolefin layer (3),
forming the internal side of the package,

on the
surface of the adhesive coated base film (2a), by dry

lamination.
A process of producing a multilayered film material for a package,
comprising the steps of:


(a) providing first and second composite films (2), each of
which is comprised of a base film (2a) and a 40-200nm (400-2000

angstrom) thick silicon oxide deposited layer (2b) formed
thereon, the base film (2a) comprised of a polyvinyl

alcohol film or an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer
saponified product film;
(b) coating an adhesive (4) on the silicon oxide deposited
layer (2b) of the first composite film (2); 
(c) laminating a protective layer (1) on the surface of the
adhesive coated silicon oxide layer (2b) of the first

composite film (2), by dry lamination;
(d) coating an adhesive (4) on the
silicon oxide deposited layer

(2b) of the second
composite film (2); 
(e) laminating the second composite film (2) on the surface
of the

first composite film (2) so that the base film (2a) of the first
composite film (2) comes in contact with the surface

of the adhesive (4) coated second composite film (2), by dry
lamination;
(f) coating an adhesive (4) on the base film (2a) of the second
composite film (2);
(g) laminating a heat-sealable polyolefin layer (3) on the
surface of the adhesive coated base film (2a) of the second

composite film (2), by dry lamination.
