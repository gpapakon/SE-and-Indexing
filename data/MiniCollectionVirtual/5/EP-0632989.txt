<ABSTRACT>
In vessels produced by pressure die casting or injection moulding, for example cooking vessels made of an aluminium alloy, direct fixing of a supporting web (2) to which for its part a grip piece (handle piece) (5) can be fixed, is difficult. For this reason, in most cases holding brackets are required onto which the supporting web (2) is welded or screwed. The holding brackets have to be inserted during casting and are constantly at risk of being swept away during casting. Other solutions which dispense with holding brackets of this type require an additional operation to fix the supporting webs to a suitably designed attachment piece of the vessel. The invention avoids additional components and integrates the supporting web into the attachment piece (7) during the casting operation using a specially designed holding piece (21).

<CLAIMS>
A utensil with a handle fastening, in particular a cooking utensil of die-cast or injection-moulded
metal, with a support frame (2) which is secured to the outer periphery

of the utensil body (1) and by way of which a handle member (5) can be pushed on in
the direction of the utensil body (1) and can be locked, wherein the support frame (2)

has a holding member (21) formed thereon which is integral therewith and which is
cast in an attachment member (11) integral with the utensil body (1), and wherein the

attachment member (11) is bounded in the direction of the handle member (5) by a
sealing plate (3) which is secured to the holding member (21) before casting-in,


characterized in that
 the holding member (21) is formed by at least one frame part
(21a, 21b) with a flat contour which is substantially upright in the position of use of

the utensil body (1).
A utensil according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the frame part (21a, 21b) is
formed as a sheet-metal part.
A utensil according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 at least one of the flat surfaces
of the frame part (21a, 21b) approximately parallel to an axis of the handle member (5)

has at least one recess.
A utensil according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the recess is formed as an opening
(21c) in the frame part (21a, 21b).
A utensil according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the sealing plate (3)
separates the attachment member (11) from a region (6) of the support frame (2) not

covered by the handle member (5).
A utensil according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the sealing plate (3) has at least
one aperture (3b) into which the holding member (21) can be inserted.
A utensil according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the holding member (21) is
formed in such a way that it fills the aperture (3b) when it is inserted into it.
A utensil according to one of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 a stop (22d), which
limits the insertion of the holding member (21) into the aperture (3b) and which strikes 

against the sealing plate (3), is provided on the said holding member (21).
A utensil according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the holding member (21) which
strikes against the sealing plate (3) can be locked in this position.
A utensil according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 on the side of the sealing plate
(3) facing the attachment member (11) the holding member (21) is provided with at

least one stamped tab (21d) or the like in such a way that the said stamped tab (21d),
resting against the sealing plate (3), projects beyond the outer contour of the aperture

(3b).
A utensil according to one of Claims 5 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the sealing plate
(3) is formed in a curved manner as a segment of a circular hollow cylinder, in such a

way that a radius of curvature (
R
) with respect to the axis of symmetry of the utensil is
provided.
A utensil according to one of Claims 5 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the periphery (3a)
of the sealing plate (3) is embedded in cast material (10).
A utensil according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 the handle
member (5) can be locked on the support frame (3) by means of a spring member (4).
A utensil according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that
 a sleeve (7) is provided
for covering a region (6) of the handle fastening which cannot be covered by the

handle member (5) and which joins the attachment part (11).
