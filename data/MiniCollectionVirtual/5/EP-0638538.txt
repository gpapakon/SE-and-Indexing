<ABSTRACT>
A process is given for removing aldehydes and acetals from technical-grade acetic acid, which is characterised in that the acetic acid with its impurities is allowed to react in the presence of a Brönstedt acid and of 0.05 to 1 per cent by weight of water and, if appropriate, 3 to 10 equivalents, based on aldehyde and acetal, of a higher-boiling polyol with the general structural unit

>
 in which n represents an integer from 0 to 3 and m represents an integer greater than 3, at temperatures from 50 to 118 DEG C over a period of 1 to 5 hours and thereupon the pure acetic acid is obtained from the reaction product by fractional distillation.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the removal of aldehydes and acetals
from industrially prepared acetic acid, which

comprises reacting the contaminated acetic acid in
the presence of a Brönstedt acid such as sulfuric

acid, methanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid or
phosphoric acid in an amount of 0.005 to 0.05 mol/l

of contaminated acetic acid and 0.05 to 1% by weight
of water and of 3 to 10 equivalents, calculated on

aldehyde and acetal, of a high-boiling polyhydric
alcohol having the general structural member



in which n is an integer from 0 to 3 and m is an
integer greater than 3, at temperatures of 50 to

118°C for a period of 1 to 5 hours, and then
isolating the pure acetic acid from the reaction

product by fractional distillation.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the high-boiling
polyhydric alcohol used is a substance

selected from the group consisting of
poly(vinylalcohol), cane sugar, dextrose, starch or

cellulose.
