<CLAIMS>
Autocrosslinkable polyacrylate resin which is 
prepared by polymerizing a mixture of 


(a) an ester of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a 
mixture of eaters of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic 

acid, 
(b) an olefinically unsaturated epoxide compound or a 
mixture of olefinically unsaturated epoxide compounds, 
(c) an olefinically unsaturated acid anhydride or a 
mixture of olefinically unsaturated acid anhydrides, 
(d) an olefinically unsaturated compound which contains 
at least one tri-, di- or monoalkoxysilane group per 

molecule, and 
(e) a further olefinically unsaturated compound 
different from (a), (b), (c) and (d), or a mixture of 

such unsaturated compounds, 
 
characterized in that it is prepared by polymerizing a 

mixture of
 
0.5 to 65% by weight of component (a), 14 to 70% by 

weight of component (b), 10 to 50% by weight of 
component (c), 10 to 50% by weight of component (d) and 

0 to 50% by weight of component (e),
 
the sum of the weight percentages for components (a) to 

(e) being 100% by weight, to give an autocrosslinkable 
polyacrylate resin which contains on statistical 

average at least one epoxide group, at least one acid 
anhydride group and at least 0.2 tri-, di- or 

monoalkoxysilane groups per molecule.  
 
Non-aqueous coating, characterized in that it 
contains 


(A) as binder, an autocrosslinkable polyacrylate resin 
according to Claim 1 or a mixture of autocrosslinkable 

polyacrylate resins according to Claim 1, and 
(B) as crosslinking catalyst at least one acid and/or 
at least one base. 
Polyacrylate resin or coating according to 
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 

autocrosslinkable polyacrylate resin is prepared by 
polymerizing a mixture of 10 to 65% by weight of 

component (a), 14 to 40% by weight of component (b), 10 
to 30% by weight of component (c), 10 to 40% by weight 

of component (d) and 0 to 20% by weight of component 
(e). 
Polyacrylate resin or coating according to one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 

autocrosslinkable polyacrylate resin has a number-average 
molecular weight of from 1000 to 50,000, 

preferably 1000 to 5000 and particularly preferably 
1000 to 3000. 
Coating according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that it contains a Lewis acid or 

Br√∂nsted acid as crosslinking catalyst. 
Process for the preparation of a multicoat 
finish, in which 


(1) a pigmented basecoat is applied to the substrate 
surface,  

 
(2) a polymer film is formed from the basecoat applied 
in step (1), 
(3) a non-aqueous transparent topcoat is applied to 
the resulting basecoat layer, and subsequently 
(4) the basecoat layer and topcoat layer are baked 
together, 
 
characterized in that the non-aqueous transparent topcoat 

applied in step (3) is a coating according to one 
of Claims 2 to 5. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the solids content of the transparent topcoat 

applied in step (3) is not less than 50% by weight.
