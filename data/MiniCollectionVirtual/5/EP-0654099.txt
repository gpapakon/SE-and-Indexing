<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for joining together two or more articles, such as sections of a fishing net, using a flexible cord (10). The cord is wound at least twice around at least a part of the articles to form a knot (19). In order to form a taught joint, the knot is influenced by mechanical means (11; 21) to create a tension in the knot of the order of 1000N or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for joining 
together two or more articles using a flexible cord which 
is wound at least twice around at least a part of said 
articles to form a knot. The invention further relates to 
a device which is suitable for carrying out the method. The 
method is particularly intended for use in the fishing 
industry for binding nets to support lines and chains. Fishing nets used in trawling are made up of several net 
sections which are joined to each other via a ripline. 
Depending on the material of the ripline and its 
application, the ripline normally has a diameter of between 
10 mm and 35 mm, though is typically around 28 mm. Edge 
regions of the net sections are gathered to form selvedges 
which are then bound to the ripline using a woven cord of 
around 4 mm diameter. The binding operation is performed 
manually at distinct locations along the ripline. The 
operation consists of threading the cord on a dolly and 
passing the dolly through a mesh in the net adjacent the 
selvedge and around the rope several dozen times at each 
location. After each winding, the cord must be pulled 
tight. The operation is completed by passing the dolly 
under one or more windings to secure the bind. The net also 
comprises a so-called bolseline bound in the manner 
described above to the lower leading edge of the net. To 
this bolseline is further bound a steel chain, typically of 
HLC 13-8 dimensions, which is attached to the hauling gear 
of the trawler. The net may also be provided with a  
 
footrope to which gear such as rockhopper gear can be 
shackled. Due to the many hundreds of bindings which are necessary to 
assemble a fishing net, the assembly task is very labour-intensive 
and time-consuming. Whilst the net itself can be 
assembled on dry land, it must be attached to the hauling 
gear of the trawler on the boat. In addition, if a section 
of net needs to be replaced, this may have to be performed 
at sea. In order to be able to exchange sections of netting or to 
replace gear, the bindings must be quickly releasable. This 
implies that the cord used for the bindings must be 
cuttable with a bladed instrument, thereby ruling out the 
possibility of using a wire-wound binding or similar. Devices are known from e.g. US-A-1 435 071, US-A-1 181 191 
and US-A-1 072 301 for applying a wire hose clamp to a 
length of hosing, whilst US-A-4 202 384 and US-A-3 254 680 
describe devices for installing self-locking straps. In 
addition, a device for applying a piece of elastic

<CLAIMS>
A method for joining together two or more articles 
(1,4,6) using a flexible cord (10) which is wound at least 

twice around at least a part of said articles to form a 
knot (9), 
characterized in
 that said 
articles are components of trawler fishing equipment, and 

in that said knot is influenced by mechanical means (11) to 
create a tension in said knot of the order of at least 

several hundred Newtons. 
The method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that the cord (10) is wound manually around 

said articles and that said mechanical means is in the form 
of a hand-held tool. 
A device for tensioning a flexible cord (10) which 
is wound at least twice around two or more articles to be 

joined, said device comprising: 

a stationary member (15) which during use is 
stationary with respect to the articles around which the 

cord (10) is wound, said stationary member being provided 
with an abutment member (16) for abutment against at least 

one of the articles which are to be joined, said abutment 
member (16) presenting two spaced-apart adjacent jaw 

members (17), each jaw member being provided with a 
substantially U-shaped opening (18) for accommodating at 

least a portion of at least one of said articles which are 
to be joined; and 
means (20,12,13) associated with said stationary 
member (15) for holding the cord and displacing it with 

respect to the stationary member (15). 
The device according to claim 3, 
characterized in
 
that said stationary member is a rod (15) 

having said abutment member (16) at one end, and said means 
for holding the cord (10) and displacing it with respect to 

the stationary member is in the form of a housing (12) into 
which the rod (15) passes, which housing is provided with 

holding means (20) for holding at least one end of the cord 
used to form the knot and means (13,14) for displacing the 

housing along the rod. 
The device according to claim 3, 
characterized in
 
that said stationary member is a housing (31) 

having said abutment member (16), and said means (20) for 
holding the cord and displacing it with respect to the 

stationary member is rotationally carried on said housing 
(31). 
The device according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 
that said means for displacing the housing 

(12) along the rod (15) comprises a worm-gear arrangement 
(14). 
The device according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in
 
that said means for displacing the 

housing along the rod is electrically, hydraulically or 
pneumatically driven.
