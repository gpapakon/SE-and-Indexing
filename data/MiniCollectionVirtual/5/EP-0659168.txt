<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to colloidal suspensions of discrete particles of colloidal zeolite and a method for preparing such zeolite from clear tetraalkylammonium stabilized aluminiumsilicate solutions. Smaller amounts of well defined and controlled metal hydroxide solutions are added to these alumiumsilicate solutions to enable the synthesis of a specific zeolite as well as to control zeolite yield. The colloidal suspensions are characterized by an average particle size of less than 250 nanometers and preferably, less than 200 nanometers together with the fact that the particle size distribution expressed as the geometric standard deviation is less than 1.30 and preferably less than 1.20. Zeolite sols synthesized according to this invention display Tyndall light scattering typical for colloidal suspensions as well as a very low rate of sedimentation due to the small particle size. Zeolite sols synthesized according to this invention can be prepared so as to contain negligable amounts of amorphous material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to colloidal suspensions of zeolite 
synthesized in clear homogeneous aluminiumsilicate solutions. The 
particles are present as discrete particles with an average particle size 
of less than 250 nanometers and preferably, less than 200 nanometers 
with a particle size distribution expressed as the geometric standard 
deviation of less than 1.30 and preferably less than 1.20. The colloidal 
zeolite sols possess characteristics typical of colloidal suspensions such 
as for example, a very low rate of sedimentation and Tyndall light 
scattering. The zeolite sols can be prepared so as to contain essentially no 
amorphous material. Such zeolite sols can be dried to a powder suitable 
for use in numerous fields of application such as the active component in 
fluid catalytic cracking catalysts. Equilibrium and demetallized fluid 
catalytic cracking catalysts may be upgraded by means of impregnation of 
such catalysts using a suitable colloidal zeolite so as for example, a 
colloidal suspension of zeolite Y. The particles of this invention can be 
deposited on suitable substrates in the production of inorganic films and 
membranes which possess molecular sieve characteristics. Such 
membranes would possess a bi-modal pore structure where the size of the 
larger pores is a function of the zeolite particle size while the size of the 
smaller pores is determined by the type of zeolite employed. The use of  
 
the sols of this invention allows for the production of films and 
membranes with controlled acid - base and ion-exchange properties. Crystalline aluminiumsilicates or zeolites are normally synthesized 
from active hydrated aluminiumsilicate gels in an alkaline enviroment. 
The synthesis of crystalline aluminiumsilicates is achieved by mixing a 
silica- and an alkaline aluminate solution, thereby obtaining an 
aluminiumsilicate gel. Suitable silica sources are for example hydrated silicates, 
precipitated silica powders and colloidal silica sols. The alumina source 
may be aluminium alkoxides, aluminium salts, aluminium oxides, 
aluminium hydroxide or metal aluminates. The necessary alkalinity is 
supplied by additions of alkali hydroxides, alkaline earth hydroxides or 
organic bases or combinations thereof. US Patent 3 130 007 describes the preparation of silica - alumina 
synthesis gels for the synthesis of zeolite Y wherein the alkali is added as 
sodium hydroxide. The method entails ageing of the gel obtained followed 
by hydrothermal treatment whereupon zeolite Y
