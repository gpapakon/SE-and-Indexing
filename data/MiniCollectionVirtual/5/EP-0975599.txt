<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, methods for the preparation
of such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as
neuromuscular blocking agents of ultra-short duration.In anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents are used to provide skeletal
muscle relaxation during surgery and during intubation of the trachea. Neuromuscular
blockers are generally classified by both the mechanism of action (depolarizing or non-depolarizing)
and the duration of action (ultrashort, short, intermediate, and long). See,
Bedford, R., "From the FDA", Anesthesiology, 82(1), 33a, 1995. Non-depolarizing
neuromuscular blocking agents include long-duration agents such as d-tubocurarine,
pancuronium, gallamine, diallyltoxiferine and toxiferine, intermediate-duration agents
such as atracurium and vecuronium, and short-duration agents such as mivacurium. See
e.g., U.S. 4,179,507, U.S. 4,701,460, U.S. 4,761,418 and U.S. 5,453,510. Conventional
non-depolarizing agents typically exhibit a 20 to 180 minute duration of action when
used as skeletal muscle relaxants. Presently there are no ultrashort duration, non-depolarizing
neuromuscular blocking agents in clinical use.Depolarizing agents include succinylcholine and decamethonium. Due to their
depolarizing mechanism of action, these agents can have severe side effects such as
cardiac arrest and death, hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia, severe muscle pain,
cardiac arrhythmias, increased intraocular pressure and increased intragastric tension.
Conventional depolarizing agents exhibit shorter durations of action, e.g., 10 to 15
minutes in humans. Succinylcholine has a rapid onset and ultrashort duration of action
and is the only ultra-short acting neuromuscular blocker in clinical use. Despite its 
undesirable side effect profile, no other ultrashort acting agent is available and thus it is
currently the preferred agent for emergency use. The ultra-short duration of action is
extremely important in emergency situations. Use of longer duration agents could lead
to serious brain damage and death.Non-depolarizing agents are generally believed to be safer and more clinically
desirable than depolarizing agents, and clinicians have long recognized the need for a
non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that has an ultra-short duration of action. See,
Miller, R.D. Anesthesia and Analgesia61(9), 721, 1982; and Belmont, M.R., Current
Opinion in Anaesthesiology, 8, 362, 1995. However, non-depolarizing agents can
exhibit side effects not specifically
