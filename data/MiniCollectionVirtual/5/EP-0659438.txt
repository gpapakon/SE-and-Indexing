<ABSTRACT>
A conjugate comprising an essentially non-toxic peptidic 
T cell antigen, which is capable of forming a complex with 

MHC class I or II molecules, and a binding partner for a 
surface receptor on mammalian target cells, whereby 


a) the binding partner has a high degree of selectivity 
for said target cells by binding to substances which are 

expressed on the surface of said cells, 
b) the conjugate comprising the binding partner and the 
T cell antigen is internalized in said cells after binding 

of the binding partner to its surface receptor on said 
cells, 
c) the T cell antigen is processed from the conjugate and 
expressed on the cell surface in the form of a complex with 

MHC molecules, whereby said complex is recognized by the T 
cell receptor, thereby inducing cytotoxicity of T cells for 

the aforesaid target cells, 
 
is useful to induce specific cytotoxicity of T cells in the 

treatment of cancer autoimmune diseases, diabetes or 
allergic reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with conjugates consisting 
of non-toxic peptidic T cell antigens and target cell binding 
partners and their use for therapy and for the manufacturing 
of therapeutic agents inducing specific cytotoxicity of 
T cells. The use of this type of conjugates is not known as a strategy 
of immunotherapy and bridges the fields of cellular and 
humoral immunology. It uses binding partners of cell surface 
receptors which have the potential to transport peptides to 
target cells where they can be internalized, processed and 
re-expressed on the cell surface, rendering the cells 
vulnerable to a cell-mediated immune reaction. Lanzavecchia et al. 1988 (1) described that patients 
injected with murine anti-tumor MAbs for cancer treatment 
possessed CD4 T cell clones specific for processed IgG. They 
postulated that some of the tumor remissions observed in 
patients treated with murine MAbs might be due to a CD4 T 
cell response directed against murine IgG peptides expressed 
on tumor cells. This finding was confirmed by the group of 
Courtnay-Luck and Epenetos (Kosmas et al. 1991) (2). Chestnut and Grey (1983) (3) were the first to show in the 
mouse system that polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Ig can be 
presented by B cells to T cells much more efficiently than 
normal rabbit IgG. Furthermore, Benjamin et al. (1986) (4)  
 
showed in a murine system that intravenously injected rat 
MAbs directed against murine cell surface antigens induced 
more anti-rat Ig antibodies than rat MAbs directed against 
soluble murine proteins. However none of these groups, who 
have contributed most to the study of antibodies as antigens, 
has suggested coupling antigenic peptides to antibodies in 
order to increase the antigenicity of tumor cells. The fact that T lymphocytes, unlike B lymphocytes, recognize 
peptides derived from processed antigens, expressed on the 
cell surface with autologous MHC, has proved to be one of the 
major discoveries of the last decade in the field of 
immunology. Current thinking on antigen processing (Germain 
et al. 1986) (5); (Bevan, 1987) (6) is that exogenous 
antigens are internalized by antigen presenting cells 
(macrophage, B lymphocytes or denditric cells), processed 
within the endosomal/lysosomal compartment and expressed on 
the cell surface as a complex with MHC class II molecules. 
This complex can stimulate CD4 T cells, which are 
predominantly but not exclusively of the helper phenotype 
(Unanue and Allen 1987) (7); (Corradin and Lanzavecchia 1991) 
(8).

additionally containing a translocating domain which will 

favor the presention of the T cell antigen in the form of a 
complex with MHC class I molecules on the surface of the 

aforesaid target cells. 
The conjugate as claimed in claims 1 to 2, characterized in 
that, as a binding partner, an anti-idiotype antibody 

against surface immunoglobulin receptors expressed on 
malignant B lymphomas is used or an anti-idiotype antibody 

 
reacting with a restricted α or β chain from the T cell 

receptor on T lymphomas. 
The conjugate as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in

interleukin or a hormone for which the said target cell has 
a receptor, is used. 
The conjugate as claimed in the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the T cell antigen and the binding 

partner are bound in such form that the binding is split by 
substances endogenously contained in the target cell. 
The conjugate as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the binding is a disulfide bridge, an ester bond capable of 

being split by esterase, or a peptide bond capable of being 
split by protease.
