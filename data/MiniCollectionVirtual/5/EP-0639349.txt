<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical instruments, 
e.g., instruments for applying surgical fasteners or 
staples to body tissue, and more particularly relates to 
visual indicators for such devices. Surgical fastening or stapling devices have been used 
in the medical industry for several years. Many of these 
instruments require approximation of various components 
during use. When applying surgical fasteners to bodily 
tissue, for example, various structures of the instrument 
must be within a predetermined distance in order for the 
device to properly function. In performing some surgical 
procedures, the surgeon may have difficulty in seeing the 
necessary components to determine when proper approximation 
has been achieved. Additionally, even when a surgeon can 
view the various components being approximated, proper gaps 
and/or distances may be so minute or precise, that even a 
trained eye may have difficulty in determining if proper 
approximation and/or alignment has been achieved. There currently exist instruments which have color 
coded elements to inform the user of proper gaps between 
the components. However, these elements are typically 
formed in windows in the instruments and require the 
surgeon to take a close look to obtain the desired 
information. Additionally, in laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon 
typically views the operation in a video screen, e.g., a TV  
 
monitor positioned remote from the surgical site. If the 
indicator is positioned on a handle portion of the 
instrument, the surgeon would need to look away from the 
video screen to view the indicator. If the indicator is 
positioned on the distal end of the instrument, then the 
indicator must be configured and colored so that it is 
readily viewable in the video screen, taking into account 
that the positioning of the instrument relative to the 
viewing scope may be less than optimum for viewing the 
indicator and that the illumination inside the body cavity 
may be limited. Aside from surgical instrumentation that require 
approximation of various components during use, other 
surgical instruments are used in surgical procedures 
whereby such instruments assume multiple positions and 
orientations during the surgical procedure. For example, 
graspers, dissectors, scissors and the like assume open and 
closed configurations in response to actions by the 
surgeon. Other devices, e.g., electrocautery devices, 
lasers and the like, supply energy to the surgical site. 
When using such instrumentation, it is necessary

<CLAIMS>
A surgical apparatus comprising: 
   a housing; 

   a first jaw member extending from said housing, and a 
second jaw member positioned opposite said first jaw 

member, at least one of said jaw members being movable 
relative to said other jaw member; 

   means positioned in the apparatus for indicating 
movement of said at least one jaw member to a predetermined 

position relative to said other jaw member, said indicating 
means including an indicator to provide visual indication 

to the user of said movement of said at least one jaw 
member to said predetermined position, said indicator being 

connected to a power source. 
An apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said 
second jaw member includes means for storing a plurality of 

surgical fasteners and said first jaw member includes a 
plurality of depressions for closing said fasteners. 
An apparatus as recited in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said indicating means comprises a light indicator. 
An apparatus as recited in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
further comprising a power source positioned in said 

apparatus. 
An apparatus as recited in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein said second jaw member is movable 

towards said first jaw member. 
An apparatus as recited in claim 5, further 
comprising means for moving said second jaw member towards 

said first jaw member. 
An apparatus as recited in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein said indicating means includes 

first and second contact members, said first contact member 
moving into contact with said second contact member when 

said moving means moves said first jaw member a sufficient 
distance towards said second jaw member, whereby the 

contact between said first and second contacts completes an 
electrical circuit. 
An apparatus as recited in claim 7, wherein said 
first and second contacts are electrically connected to 

said light indicator. 
An apparatus as recited in claim 8, further 
comprising a battery positioned in said housing and being 

electrically connected to said first and second contacts.

wherein said moving means further comprises a second rod 

member extending from said anvil and adapted to be 

connected to said slidable rod member, wherein movement of 
said moving means in a first direction slides said anvil 

toward said cartridge and movement in a second direction 
slides said anvil away from said cartridge.
