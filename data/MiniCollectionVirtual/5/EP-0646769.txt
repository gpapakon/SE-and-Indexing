<ABSTRACT>
A displacement measurement apparatus utilizing an 
astigmatism, comprises an objective lens, an optical system 

detecting an offset distance between a relative distance of the 
objective lens to a measured surface and its focal distance by 

utilizing a reflection beam from the measured surface, to 
generate a focus-error signal, an actuator connected to the lens 

for moving the objective lens in a direction of an optical axis of 
the lens on the basis of the focus-error signal, so that the relative 

distance is maintained at the focal distance, and a linear scale and 
a detecting head cooperative with each other for detecting a 

displacement of the linear scale to the head. One of the linear 
scale and the head is integrally connected to the actuator for 

moving together with the lens and coaxially aligned with the 
optical axis, and the other is stationary. A first servo control 

circuit is arranged for executing a first feedback control based on 
a linear-scale displacement signal so that the linear-scale 

displacement signal is adjusted to zero. A second servo control 
circuit is arranged for executing a second feedback control based 

on the focus-error signal so that the focus-error signal is adjusted 
to zero. The first feedback control is executed when a signal level 

of the focus-error signal is shifted to a dead zone in which the 
focus-error signal is unuseable as a servo signal necessary for the 

second feedback control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a displacement
measurement apparatus according to the preamble of independent
claim 1 which is applied for
measuring or detecting a displacement of continuous measured
points on a measured surface with respect to a reference plane,
and specifically to a measurement apparatus which is capable of
a displacement of a measured object by detecting an offset
distance between a relative distance of an objective lens to a
measured surface and a focal distance of the objective lens, by
way of an astigmatism method.Such a displacement measurement apparatus is known from DE-A-4 219 311.US-A-4 542 491 discloses an optical information disc apparatus with a similar autofocusing
servo system. This servo system comprises a first servo system which operates
based on a focus-error signal generated by four photocells. Moreover, this apparatus
comprises a second servo control circuit which is arranged for moving the lens into a range
within which the focus-error signal is usable as a servo signal for auto-focussing. However,
the feedback signal which is generated from this known second servo control circuit also
depends on the output of the four photocells. Therefore, the speed of the second servo
control circuit is limited. As is generally known, in order to measure or detect a
displacement or dimensions of a measured surface or a measured
object, a displacement measurement apparatus which utilizes a
laser beam and an objective lens, has been used. One such
displacement measurement apparatus has been disclosed in
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication (Tokkai Heisei) No. 4-366711
corresponding to Japanese Patent Application No. 3-141836,
assigned to the same assignee of the present invention.
Fig. 5 shows the prior art displacement measurement apparatus
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 4-366711.
Referring now to Fig. 5, reference numeral 1 denotes a
displacement detecting optical system which system detects an
offset distance between a relative distance of an objective lens 5
to a measured surface 6 and a focal distance of the objective lens
5, by utilizing a reflection laser beam reflected from the
measured surface 6. Reference numeral 16 denotes an actuator
which is provided for moving the objective lens 5 in a direction of
its optical axis 21 on the basis of an output signal produced by a
four-split diode 7 employed in the optical system 1, so that the
relative distance between the objective lens 5 and the measured
surface 6 is adjusted to the focal distance
