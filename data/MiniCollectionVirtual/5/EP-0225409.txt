<ABSTRACT>
Particle-emitting radionuclides (Y-90 and In-115) 
have been complexed with phosphonic acid derivatives 

of organic amine or substituted organic amine 
compounds wherein the nitrogen and phosphorus are 

interconnected by an alkylene group. These complexes 
have been found useful in the treatment of calcific 

tumors in animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
Aminophosphonic acids are known to chelate 
metal ions. Particularly stable chelates are formed 
with metals from the alkaline earth and transition 
metal series. The development of a bone metastasis is a 
common and often catastrophic event for a cancer patient. 
The pain, pathological fractures, frequent neurological 
deficits and forced immobility caused by these metastatic 
lesions significantly decreases the quality of life for 
the cancer patient. The number of patients that contract 
metastatic disease is large since nearly 50% of all 
patients who contract breast, lung or prostate carcinoma 
will eventually develop bone metastases. This indicates the 
prevalence of the disease. Bone metastases are also 
seen in patients with carcinoma of the kidney, thyroid, 
bladder, cervix and other tumors, but collectively, 
these represent less than 20% of patients who develop 
bone metastases. Metastatic bone cancer is rarely life 
threatening and occasionally patients live for years 
following the discovery of the bone lesions. Initially, 
treatment goals center on relieving pain, reducing 
requirements for narcotic medication and increasing 
ambulation. Clearly, it is hoped that some of the 
cancers can be cured.  The use of radionuclides for treatment of 
cancer metastatic to the bone dates back to the early 
1950's. It has been proposed to inject a radioactive 
particle-emitting nuclide in a suitable form for the 
treatment of calcific lesions. It is desirable that 
such nuclides be concentrated in the fast growing 
portion of the bone with minimal amounts reaching the 
soft tissue and normal bone. Radioactive phosphorus 
compounds (P-32 and P-33) have been proposed. However, 
the nuclear and biolocalization properties limit the 
use of these compounds. (Kaplan, E., et al, Journal of 
Nuclear Medicine, Vol. 1, No. 1, page 1, 1960); (U.S. 
Patent 3,965,254). Another attempt has been made using phosphorus 
compounds containing a boron residue. The compounds 
were injected into the body (intravenously) and accumu­
lated in the skeletal system. The patient was then 
irradiated with neutrons in order to activate the boron 
and give a therapeutic radiation dose. (U.S. Patent 
4,399,817). In the above-mentioned procedures, it is not 
possible to give therapeutic doses to the tumor without 
substantial damage to normal tissues. In many cases, 
especially for metastatic bone lesions, the tumor has 
spread throughout the skeletal system and amputation or 
irradiation of a portion of the body is not practical.
