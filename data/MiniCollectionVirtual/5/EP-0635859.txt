<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a circuit breaker comprising at least one pair of separable contacts at least one of which is movable, a control mechanism with lock-on driven by at least one electromagnetic thruster, in the gap of which a movable arm is arranged carrying the said moving contact, this arm being arranged to carry out its supplementary function of opening of the said separable contacts in the event of a short-circuit. The moving support arm (18) of the moving contact (17) is equipped with a screen (40) which is arranged to the rear of the said moving contact. It is produced either as a component moulded from synthetic material, or as a machined or folded component made from a material which is a poor electrical conductor. The screen is for the purpose of avoiding a backwards movement of the root of the arc in the event of a short-circuit.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit breaker comprising at least one pair of separable contacts (16, 17) at least
one (17) of which is movable, an operating mechanism (22) controlled by at least one

electromagnetic propeller (24) having a magnetic circuit (25) in the air-gap (32) of
which circuit there is located a movable arm supporting said movable contact, this

arm being arranged to perform an opening function of said separable contacts in the
event of a short-circuit,

characterized in that said movable arm (18) is equipped with an insulating or weakly
electrically conducting cover (40, 41) arranged at the rear of said movable contact

(17), that the stationary contact (16) is arranged at one end of the air-gap (32), and
that the contact arm (18) is mounted pivoting around a spindle (35) situated opposite

the stationary contact (16), the cover (40, 41) extending between the movable contact
(17) and said spindle (35) and being made of a material having a high thermal

resistance.
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that said cover (40, 41) is
formed by a moulded part made of insulating synthetic material.
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that said cover (40, 41) is
formed by a machined part made of a weakly conducting material.
The circuit breaker according to claim 3, characterized in that said machined part is
made of steel.
The circuit breaker according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
middle of the pad forming the stationary contact (16) is located appreciably in the front

plane of the polar parts (30, 31), one half of the pad being inserted in the air-gap (32)
and the other half protruding outwards therefrom.
The circuit breaker according to claim 5, characterized in that the width of the pad
of the stationary contact (16) is smaller than the thickness of the air-gap (32) and

appreciably equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the contact arm (18) and of the
insulating cover (40). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 2 or 6, characterized in that the insulating
material of the cover (40) is polyamide amide-based.
