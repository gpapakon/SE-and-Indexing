<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a transient discriminate harmonics 
generator which receives an audio input signal and produces 

an output signal containing harmonics of the input signal. 
The output signal is amplitude shaped as a function of the 

input signal's time and amplitude envelope. The present 
invention transient discriminate harmonics generator 

generally comprises a control circuit for determining a 
control parameter, and a harmonics generating circuit 

regulated by the control circuit for producing an output 
signal containing harmonics of an input signal, where the 

transient discriminate harmonics generator first generates a 
relatively high level of harmonics at an initial occurrence 

of the input signal, then incrementally reduces the level of 
harmonics generated during a time period determined by the 

control parameter following the initial occurrence of the 
input signal, and finally produces a relatively low level of 

harmonics after the end of the time period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field of electronic audio equipment,
namely to a transient harmonics generator by which the amplitude of harmonic
frequencies of an input signal is controlled as a function of time. The invention also
relates to a method for generating harmonic frequencies of an input signal. Harmonics generators are widely used in various applications
of audio signal processing utilized for creating musical
sound effects and enhancing sound quality. For example, a
product made by Aphex Systems Ltd. called an "Aural Exciter"
under United States Patent No. 4,150,253 is based partly upon
the use of a harmonics generator. Generally, a harmonics
generator can be defined as a device which is used
intentionally to produce harmonics of an input signal. Such a
device may also produce spurious frequencies, for example
beat frequencies, without violating the definition of a
harmonics generator. A simple harmonics generator can be
comprised of a full-wave rectifier circuit. The output signal
from a full wave rectifier contains not only harmonics of the
input signal, but also beat frequencies if the input signal
is composed of typical audio waveforms which are composed of
many frequency components.In the prior art, non-linear circuits such as log amplifiers,
rectifiers and multipliers are used as harmonics generators.
These circuits all follow different harmonics generation laws
depending on their input-output transfer functions. However,
it can be generalized that the amplitude of the harmonics in
the output signal is mainly a function of the input signal
amplitude without regard to time. As a result, the harmonics
which are developed resemble merely disortion products of the
input signal. The usability of prior art harmonics generators
for sound enhancement and music is therefore limited because 
the harmonics produced do not generally resemble harmonics of natural sounds
and thus, are not pleasing to the human ear.US-A-4 018 121 describes a method of synthesising a musical sound by means of
frequency modulation with the carrier and modulating frequencies being in the
audio range and the modulating index being related to a function of time to control
the bandwidth and evolution in time of the partial frequencies of synthesising
sound.It is desirable to provide a harmonics generator that can generate harmonics which
is not only a function of the amplitude of the input signal, but also a function of
the time, to thereby better resemble the harmonics of natural sounds for sound
enhanceme
