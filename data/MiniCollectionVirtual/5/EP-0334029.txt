<CLAIMS>
Valve (2, 2a) having an electromagnet (4), with 
an armature (7, 7a) which is aligned such that it can 

move in the longitudinal axis of said electromagnet and 
is drilled hollow over its entire length, having a first 

valve seat (8), aligned on the same axis as the armature 
(7, 7a), as well as a first associated closing piece (10, 

10a), and having a first closing piece holder (11, 11a), 
which can be moved in the longitudinal direction of the 

electromagnet (4) by means of the armature (7, 7a), and 
having a second valve seat (12, 12a) as well as a second 

associated closing piece (14, 14a), and having a second 
closing piece holder (15, 15a), which can likewise be 

moved in the longitudinal direction of the electromagnet 
(4) by means of the armature (7, 7a), having a valve 

closing spring (16 or 16a), installed pretensioned, 
between the closing piece holders (11, 15 or 11a, 15a), 

and having a device (19, 19a or 19b) which maintains the 
pretensioning of the valve closing spring (16 or 16a), 

and having at least one pretensioned armature restoring 
spring (17, 18), which projects into a cylindrical hole 

(20 or 20a) of the armature (7, 7a) that runs in the 
longitudinal direction of the valve, characterised in 

that the device (19, 19a or 19b) consists of an element 
(19, 19a or 19b) which can be displaced in said hole (20 

or 20a) of the armature (7, 7a) in an adjustable manner 
to overcome frictional sticking, is constructed essentially 

in a tubular manner and has a radially inwardly 
directed rim (22) which, on the one hand, forms a stop  

 
shoulder (23) for the closing piece holder (15) that is 

stressed by the valve closing spring (16 or 16a) and, on 
the other hand, is a stop for one end of the armature 

restoring spring (17). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the element (19, 19a or 19b) is constructed as a deep-drawn 

part. 
Valve according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the element (19) has a constriction (21), into which 

the one end of the armature restoring spring (17) dips, 
in the region of the stop shoulder (23). 
Valve according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the length of the tubular element (19, 

19a or 19b) is greater than half its diameter. 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the cylindrical hole (20) extends over the entire length 

of the armature (7a), and in that a second tubular 
element (19b) is pressed into the armature (7a) such that 

both closing piece holders (11a, 15a) are located, with 
the valve closing spring (16a), between the tubular 

elements (19a, 19b).
