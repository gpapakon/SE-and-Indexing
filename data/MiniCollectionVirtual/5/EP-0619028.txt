<ABSTRACT>
An optical viewing system produces a simulated three dimensional image (122) having one or more foreground layers on a substantially transparent field, and one or more background features projected to appear behind the foreground layer(s). The device can utilize two video monitors (12, 14) or one monitor (100) wherein the foreground and background are presented in distinct adjacent areas (112, 114). A full silvered mirror (118) can reflect the background to the observer (130) through a half silvered mirror (116) which transmits the background and reflects the foreground, the foreground appearing to the observer (130) as closer than the background. A display surface (110) can be oriented horizontally and the foreground and background layers projected in horizontally divided areas (126, 128) of the display surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THREE DIMENSIONAL OPTICAL VIEWING SYSTEM Background of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an optical viewing syste that produces a simulated three dimensional image which can b viewed by individuals.2. Prior ArtHumans have binocular vision for perceiving three dimensiona scenes, that is, scenes having depth as well as height and width. A single viewing apparatus such as a single human eye, can perceiv scenes only two dimensionally. The perception of depth in a thre dimensional space is due to the difference in the angle or relativ position of features of the scene at different distances from th viewer, in views taken from two spaced points of view, also know as parallax.It is known to simulate a three dimensional image using dua two dimensional media. Two images of the same scene are prepared, each being a two-dimensional view of the three dimensional scene, but the two being taken from laterally spaced positions. Whe viewing one image with one eye and the other image with the othe eye, the viewer perceives the image to have depth, in the sam manner that the user's eyes perceive depth in actual thre dimensional scenes.An individual can view such a specially processed o configured dual two dimensional image through special eyeglasses. For example, the dual images can be superimposed on one two dimensional viewing area and separated using light polarization. One of the dual two-dimensional images is presented in light polarized at one angle, and the other is presented in light polarized 90Â° out of phase with the first. The observer views the superimposed images through eyeglasses which have lenses polarized in a complementary manner to separate the dual images such that one is presented to each eye. Each lens transmits one form of polarized light and inhibits passage of the other form of polarized light. The eyes of the viewer essentially receive images of the three dimensional scene from different perspectives, and the brain 

 interprets the dual two dimensional images as one scene having depth.Various optical systems for producing three dimensional images in this manner are known, such as systems using lenticular lenses and films, and other stereoscopic systems which include lenses or prisms for transmitting the two images separately, one to each eye. Normally, stereoscopic scenes are static. However, moving pictures can also be accomplished. The two images can be projected from a single two dimensional projection, and separated by use of complementary colors,
