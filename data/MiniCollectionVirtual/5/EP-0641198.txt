<DESCRIPTION>
 MED1CAMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETYThis invention relates to a method of treatment of anxiety in mammals, including humans.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn- Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor.EP-A-501322 (Glaxo Group Limited), WO 93/02677, WO 93/03725, WO 93/05038, WO 93/05040 and PCT/GB93/00506 (SmithKline Beecham pic) describe compounds having 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.Some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed as of potential use in the treatment of anxiety (see GB 2153821A, EP-A-229444 (Glaxo Group Ltd.) and EP-A-201165 (Beecham Group p.l.c)).We have now discovered that a compound which acts as an antagonist at 5-HT4 receptors is of potential use in the treatment of anxiety, such as general anxiety disorder (GAD), mixed anxiety/depression or panic disorder.The conditions under which anxiolysis is observed for this compound in the elevated X-maze differs from those required for the observation of the anxiolytic effects of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Furthermore the site of action of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists is thought to be the amygdala (Higgins et al 1991, Pschopharmacology, 104, 545-551), while 5-HT4 receptor mediated anxiolysis is likely to be effected via the hippocampus (Dumuis et al 1988, Mol Pharmacol., 34, 880-887).The invention therefore provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety in mammals, including humans, which method comprises administering to the mammal in need of such treatment and/or prophylaxis, an effective and/or prophylactic amount of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist.5-HT4 receptor antagonists may be identified according to standard methods, such as that described hereinafter, and the methods described in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol. 342, 619-622 and M 439-446, and J. Pharamcol. Exp. Ther. (1990) 252. 1378-1386.. 

Examples of 5-HT4 receptor antagonists include R 50595 (Janssen), which is described in FR76530 and EurJ. Pharmacol., lÎ´l 119-125 (1990), SDZ 205-557, which is described by K.H. Buchheit and R. Gamse in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.Pharmacol., 242 (Supp ), R101 (1991) and 245, 387-393 (1992), DAU 6215 (Br. J. Pharmacol. (1991), 1-Q4, Proc. Supp.47P, DAU 6285 (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.Pharmacol, 45; 264-269 (1992), RS 23597-190 (Syntex - British PharmacologySociety Meeting, September 1992), SC 53606 (Searle - 2nd International Symposium on Serotonin, Houston, USA , - September 1992)

Claims
1. A method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety in mammals, including humans, which method comprises administering to the mammal in need of such treatment and/or prophylaxis, an effective and/or prophylactic amount of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist.
2. The use of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety.
3. A pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety, which comprises a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
4. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the
5-HT4 receptor antagonist is more potent at 5-HT4 receptors than at 5-HT3 receptors.
5. A method, use or composition according to claim 4 for the treatment of general anxiety disorder (GAD) or mixed anxiety/depression.
6. A method, use or composition according to claim 5 for the treatment of panic disorder.
7. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 5-HT4 receptor antagonist is R 50595, SDZ 205-557, DAU 6285, RS 23597-190, SC 53606 or GR 113808.
8. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 5-HT4 receptor antagonist is a compound described in relation to WO 93/02677, WO 93/03725, WO 93/05038, WO 93/05040 and PCT/GB93/00506 (SmithKline Beecham pic).
