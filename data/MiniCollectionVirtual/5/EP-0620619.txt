<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a shorting bar insert (29) 
for placement in a modular jack assembly to provide for the 

selective shorting of predetermined contacts during periods 
of nonelectrical engagement with a modular plug, such as for 

an eight position miniature modular jack, comprises the step 
of preparing a strip of stamped contacts (10) from a planar 

sheet metal blank joined together by a removable carrier 
strip having a front face (24) and a back face (27), where 

the contacts (10) are formed in pairs in parallel relationship 
and joined together at their ends (16) remote from the 

carrier strip, the carrier strip including registration 
means (20), such as holes, offset from the centerline of 

each respective pair of contacts. Thereafter, a pair of 
contact containing carrier strips are placed in back-to-back 

relationship with the registration means (20) aligned, 
whereby the contacts (10) are realigned in overlapping 

relationship, and a dielectric material is insert moulded 
about the joined ends of the overlapping sets of contacts. 

Finally, removal of the carrier strips reveals a modular 
jack assembly (44) insert having projecting parallel contacts 

matching the modular jack contact slot spacing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a method for the 
manufacture of a contact shorting bar insert for 
placement in a modular jack assembly to provide for the 
selective shorting of predetermined electrical contacts 
therewithin, i.e. maintain line continuity when no plug 
is present in the modular jack assembly according to the 
preamble of claim 1. A preferred embodiment thereof is 
in accordance with USOC STYLE DESIGNATION RJ48X, for an 
8 position miniature modular jack, which requires 
shorting between contacts 1 & 4 and 2 & 5. Means to 
effect shorting of selected contacts in a modular jack 
assembly are exemplified by the following references. U.S. Patent No. 4,863,393 to Ward et al. teaches 
the use of a bridging card, inserted within a modular 
jack housing, to effect selected shorting of 
predetermined contacts. The card may be a conventional 
printed circuit board with essentially U-shaped 
conductors deposited on each major surface thereof, 
where the ends are aligned with the contacts to be 
shorted or bridged. U.S. Patent No. 4,699,443 to Goodrich et al. 
includes a pair of cantilevered switch contact spring 
members which are activated in response to the insertion 
of a plug into a modular jack housing. U.S. Patent No. 4,274,691 to Abernethy et al. is 
directed to the use of a generally U-shaped metal 
component that is mounted in the rear wall of the 
housing with the arms or prongs thereof projecting into 
the housing cavity into which the plug is inserted. U.S. Patent No. 4,552,423 to Swengel, Jr. relates 
to a programmable shunting strip stamped and formed from 
sheet metal. The shunting strip comprises a web from 
which a series of contact fingers stamped to extend 
transversely of the web substantially in its plane.  
 
Selected contact fingers may be bent to extend 
transversely of the plane of the web for receipt in an 
electrical connector socket to common selected terminals 
in the socket. U.S. Patent No. 4,725,241 to Bertini et al. teaches 
a system which includes a make/break switching 
arrangement with the housing, whereupon the plug, 
insertable therein, includes a camming member which 
breaks the shorting circuit between selected contacts 
within the assembly. U.S. Patent No. 5,123,854 to Peterson et al. is 
directed to a shunting system for a modular jack type 
connector. The system includes a pair of programmable 
shunts substantially identically stamped and differently 
formed from sheet metal material for engagement with the 
contact portions when the two shunts are mounted

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a shorting bar insert 
(29, 29') for placement in a modular jack assembly (44) 

to provide for the selective shorting of predetermined 
contacts during periods of nonelectrical engagement with 

a modular plug, the method being characterized by the steps of 

(a) preparing a strip of stamped and formed 
contacts (10) from a planar sheet metal blank 

joined together by a removable carrier strip (12) 
having a front face (24) and a back face (27), 

where said contacts (10) are formed in pairs in 
parallel relationship and joined together at their 

ends (16) remote from said carrier strip (24), said 
carrier strip (12) including registration means 

(20) offset from the centerline of each respective 
pair of contacts in a specified asymmetrical 

relationship, 
(b) placing a pair of contact containing carrier 
strips (12) in back-to-back relationship with said 

registration means (20) aligned, whereby said 
contacts on the strips realign in overlapping 

relationship to form a symmetrical set, 
(c) insert molding a dielectric material about the 
joined ends (16) of said overlapping sets of 

contacts, and 
(d) removing said carrier strips (12) to reveal a 
modular jack assembly insert (29, 29') having 

projecting parallel contacts matching the modular 
jack contact slot spacing. 
The method according to claim 1, further 
characterized by said stamped contacts (10) being 

angularly formed toward said rear face (27) adjacent 
said carrier strip (12) and at the remote end toward 

said front face (24). 
The method according to claim 1, further 
characterized by a mid portion (28) of each said contact 

being plated with an electrically conductive metal. 
The method according to claim 1, further 
characterized by said modular jack assembly (44) having 

a plurality of cantilevered contact arms (46) where said 
shorting bar insert (29, 29') is intended to provide 

shorting between only the selected pairs of said contact 
arms, and said insert molding further provides for the 

addition of an angled rib (30) to be aligned with each 
non shorting contact arm. 
The method according to claim 1, further 
characterized by said modular jack assembly (44) being 

an 8 position miniature modular jack, and that said 
insert (29, 29') is intended to provide shorting between 

contacts 1 
&
 4 and 2 
&
 5.
