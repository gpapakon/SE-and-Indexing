<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switching device for circuit breakers, which switching device has means for transmitting a tripped message to an external auxiliary contact device built onto the circuit breaker, consisting of a manual operating device (4) which is operatively connected to a latching mechanism which consists, in a known manner, of a toggle lever which is cocked by the manual operating device and is tripped by the thermal or magnetic release. A tripping lever (10) of the auxiliary contact device projects into the circuit breaker and is operatively connected to the toggle lever part (20). The toggle lever part (20) has a platform (21) which projects laterally out of the flat side of said toggle lever part (20) and interacts with a tab (11) projecting laterally out of the tripping lever (10), in such a manner that the tripping lever (10) is also driven when the circuit breaker trips as a result of overcurrent. The toggle lever part (20) is hinged on the switching link (30) by means of a shaft (22) in such a manner that, during manual switching-off, the toggle lever part (20) is on the one hand pivoted and, on the other hand, the shaft (22) can move along a guide path (33) which is arranged in the switching link (30). The switching link (30) has a driver (dog) (32) which drives the latching rocker (14) and switches the circuit breaker off, via a switching-off lever (12), once the switching link (30) and hence also the toggle lever part (20) have moved through a specific pivoting distance s1, without operating the tripping lever (10) of the auxiliary contact device.

Switching device for circuit breakers, especially for polyphase motor 
protection switches, including means for the transmission of a signal 

indicating the released position to an auxiliary switch (1) mounted extemally 
on the switching device (2), consisting of a device for manual operation (4) 

which cooperates with a switch latch (3, 30) and that consists in a known way 
of a toggle lever (13, 14, 20) which is tensioned by means of the device for 

manual operation (4) and released by thermal or magnetic releasing devices, 

characterized in that
 a releasing lever (10) of the auxiliary switch (1 ) extends 
into the circuit breaker (2) and a toggle lever part (20) of the circuit breaker (2) 

cooperates with the releasing lever (10) of the auxiliary switch (1) in such a 
way that the toggle lever part (20) slews the releasing lever (10) when the 

circuit breaker (2) is released by an overcurrent, while the toggle lever part 
(20) does not cooperate with the releasing lever (10) when the circuit breaker 

(2) is switched off by hand. 
Switching device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the toggle lever 
part (20) of the circuit breaker (2) presents a platform (21) projecting laterally 

from the large side of the toggle lever part (20), and that the releasing lever 
(10) of the auxiliary switch (1) presents a nose (11) which projects laterally 

from the large side of the releasing lever (10) at the end extending into the 
circuit breaker (2), and which cooperates with the platform (21), projecting 

from the toggle lever part (20) and situated in front of this nose (11), in such a 
way that the releasing lever (10) is carried along by the platform (21) of the 

toggle lever part (20) when the circuit breaker (2) is released by overcurrent, 
while the nose (11) and the platform (21) move past one another and without 

touching one another when switching-off is done by hand.  
 
Switching device as claimed in any claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
toggle lever part (20) is hinged on the switching gate (30) by means of an axle 

(22) in such a way that the toggle lever part (20) is slewed by the slewing 
movement of the switching gate (30) on the one hand, and that the axle 

(22)can move along a guideway (33) arranged in the switching gate (30) on 
the other hand. 
Switching device as claimed in any claim 1 through 3, 
characterized in that
 
the switching gate (30) presents a carrier (32) which is arranged in such a 

way that it carries the latch rocker (14) away via a switching-off lever (12) and 
switches the circuit breaker out only after the switching gate (30) and thus 

also the toggle lever part (20) have travelled a determined slewing distance 
s1 when the switching device is operated with the help of the device for 

manual operation (4).
