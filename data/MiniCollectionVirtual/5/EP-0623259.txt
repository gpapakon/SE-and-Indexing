<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of transceivers and in
particular to those transceivers using balanced mixers.In a radio frequency (RF) receiver which uses a balanced mixer or an
image rejection mixer to provide the IF signal, it is often required to
provide transform phase relation ships of RF inputs, LO inputs, or IF
outputs. By using the balanced mixer or the image rejection mixer the
effect of even order harmonics of the LO. and RF input are substantially 
reduced. Therefore, significant improvement in noise performance as
well as intermodulation (IM) distortion of the receiver is realized.The mixer is generally integrated within an IC substrate using well-known
integrated circuit technologies. The IC substrate may be a GaAs,
silicon or similar appropriate substrates upon which the balanced mixer
is disposed.A transformation network is required to transform a single input to
differential (i.e., 180 degree out of phase) or quadrature (i.e., 90 degree out
of phase) outputs which drive the inputs of the mixer. Also needed is
another transformation network to transform outputs of the mixer to a
single output. Generally, such transformation networks are bidirectional
and the same structure may be used to perform both transformation
functions.In view of the constant drive to reduce the size and cost of the
receivers, it is desired to integrate the transformation networks and the
mixer on the same substrate. In this way, small and easily
manufacturable receivers may be obtained without degrading the
specification improvements provided by using balanced or image rejection
mixers.Conventionally, coil transformers are widely used as transformation
networks in a variety of applications and provide wide band conversion
from a single-ended port to balanced ports and vice versa. However, coil
transformers are expensive and bulky, in addition to complicating the
manufacturing process. Most importantly, they cannot be integrated on
the same IC substrate as that of the balanced mixer.The transformation networks may also be produced using
transmission lines or discrete components. However, these components
are not integratable. Additionally, at low frequency applications, the size
of these components becomes substantially large, which further limits
their use in highly miniaturized receivers.Another method for providing a single input to a balanced output,
comprises using differential amplifier pairs. This circuit, though
integrated, consumes current, produces distortion, and has an inherent
phase and
