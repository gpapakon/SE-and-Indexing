<ABSTRACT>
For contacting a non-linear switching element (10), for example for use in 
a display device (1), a metallic layer (14) is provided on a layer of non-linear resistive 

material by means of a low-energetic deposition technique. This layer may function as a 
contact but also as a protective layer when a contact metallization (15) is provided at a 

later stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display device comprising an electro-optical
medium between two supporting plates which are located opposite each other and whose
facing sides are provided with a plurality of column electrodes and row electrodes,
respectively, while at least one of the supporting plates is provided with a plurality of picture
electrodes which are connected to the row or column electrodes via non-linear switching
elements, each non-linear switching element comprising a non-linear resistive material
between a first and a second electrically conducting layer, the electrically conducting layer
located at the side of the electro-optical medium being metallic and separated from the non-linear
resistive layer by a metallic protective layer.Display devices of this type are used, for example, as display panels in
measuring equipment, personal computers and television receivers.The invention also relates to a non-linear switching element and to a
method of manufacturing a non-linear switching element.These non-linear switching elements may not only be used in said
display devices but also, for example in circuits for pressure sensors or photosensitive panels.JP-A-60-016473 shows a non-linear resistance element of a thin film,
which is stable and has less variation with time by micro-crystallization of a semiconductor
layer of said element. A metallic layer of micro-crystal A1 or the like is provided on the
semiconductor layer in order to stabilize the semiconductor layer and to prevent
semiconductor deterioration due to an etch process.EP-A-202 150 shows a non-linear switch element for a flat electro-optic

stack of subsequently a first layer of metallic material, a first layer of non-doped amorphous
semiconductor material, a layer of doped amorphous semiconductor material, a second layer
of non-doped amorphous semiconductor material and a second layer of a metallic material.JP-A-60-037178 shows a non-linear resistance element for a display
device being stable and having a small variation with time by a method wherein a metal layer 
is formed on a semiconductor layer, and an attack onto the semiconductor layer according to a
post-process is checked by covering on the semiconductor layer with a metal layer.JP-A-60-210881 shows a non-linear resistance element of thin film for display,
in which the display quality is improved by increasing the threshold voltage by a method
wherein Cr films of 50 - 2,000 Angstrom thickness
