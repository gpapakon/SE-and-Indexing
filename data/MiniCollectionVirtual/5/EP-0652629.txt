<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bearing for a limited rotation rotor having a rotor rotation shaft and at least one elastic resetting element. According to the invention, this bearing is composed of two bearing bodies which are permanently connected to one another by means of at least one elastic resetting element. The rotor is in this case connected firmly to one of the bearing bodies and is connected to the other bearing body such that it can rotate.

Bearing for a limited rotation rotor (6,10,20) with an axis of rotation (6', 14, 25) 
and a minimum of one elastic reset component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d), characterized 

by the fact that the bearing (1, 11, 21) of the rotor (6, 10, 20) is composed of at 
least a first (2, 11a) and a second (3, 11b) bearing component, that the rotor (6, 

10, 20) in a first part (6a) adjacent to the rotor component is permanently connected 
with the first bearing component (2, 11a) in a first bearing area, that the 

rotor (6, 10, 20) in a second part (6b) adjacent to the rotor component is connected 
with the second bearing component (3, 11b) in a second bearing area 

so as to be rotationally mobile, and that the first bearing component (2, 11a) is 
connected with the second bearing component (3, 11b) by a minimum of one 

elastic reset component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d). 
Bearing according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the elastic reset 
component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d) is arranged outside of the rotor axis of rotation (6', 

14, 25), 
Bearing according to one of the claims or 2, characterized by the fact that the 
elastic reset component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d) is an elastic bar. 
Bearing according to one of the claims 1-3, characterized by the fact that the 
elastic reset component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d) is a spring plate. 
Bearing according to one of the claims 1-4, characterized by the fact that the 
longitudinal axis of the elastic reset component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d) is aligned radially 

towards the exterior with respect to the axis of rotation (6', 14, 25) and 
parallel to the axis of rotation (6', 14, 25) of the rotor (6, 10, 20).

the elastic reset component (4a-d, 13, 22a-d). 
Bearing according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that a second bearing 
component (11b) is provided with a stop (18) which prevents the rotor (10) 

moving beyond a previously defined rotation range. 
Bearing according to one of the claims 6 or 7, characterized by the fact that at 
least one protuberance (23a-d) contains a first magnetic device, that a second 

magnetic device (26a-d) is arranged about the protuberance (23a-d), and that 
at least one magnetic device (26a-d) can be varied in power of the magnetic 

field it generates. 
Bearing according to claim 8, characterized by the fact that the protuberances 
(23a-d) are made of a magnetizable material. 
Bearing according to one of the claims 2-9, characterized by the fact that at 
least three elastic reset components (4a-d, 13, 22a-d) are arranged between' 

the first and the second bearing component (2, 3, 11a, 11b). 
Bearing according to one of the claims 1-10, characterized by the fact that the 
two bearing components (2, 3, 11a, 11b) and the elastic reset component (4a-d, 

13, 22a-d) are made monolithically from a single, solid body. 
Bearing according to one of the claims 1-11, characterized by the fact that the 
first bearing component has at least one recess (15), that the rotor (10) has at 

its first end a body (16) which is perpendicular to the axis of rotation (14), and 
that this body (16) fits exactly into and is attached in the recess (15).  

 
Bearing according to claim 11, characterized by the fact that the rotor (6,10, 
20) is also made from the same solid body. 
Bearing according to one of the claims 1-13, characterized by the fact that the 
bearing (1,11) is installed inside a scanner.
