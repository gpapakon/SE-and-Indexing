<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to embossed cellulosic fibrous
structures, and to a process and apparatus for making such embossed
cellulosic fibrous structures.Cellulosic fibrous structures are a staple of everyday life.
Cellulosic fibrous structures are used as consumer products such as paper
towels, toilet tissue, and facial tissue.Multiple lamina cellulosic fibrous structures are very well known in
the art of consumer products. Such products are cellulosic fibrous
structures having more than one, typically two, laminae superimposed in
face-to-face relationship to form a laminate. Frequently these laminae
are embossed for aesthetic reasons, to maintain the laminae in face-to-face
relation as the laminate is used by the consumer, or to provide
spacing between the laminae.During the embossing process, the laminae are fed through a nip
formed between juxtaposed axially parallel rolls. Discrete protuberances
on these rolls compress like regions of each lamina into engagement and
contacting relationship with the opposing lamina. The compressed regions
of the laminae provide an aesthetic pattern and provide for joining of
and maintaining the laminae in face-to-face contacting relationship.Embossing is typically performed by one of two processes,
knob-to-knob embossing, wherein protuberances on axially parallel rolls
juxtaposed to form a nip therebetween are registered with protuberances
on the opposing roll, and nested embossing where the protuberances of one
roll mesh between the protuberances of the other roll. Examples of 
knob-to-knob embossing and nested embossing are illustrated in the prior
art by U.S. Patents 3,414,459 issued December 3, 1968 to Wells and
commonly assigned; 3,547,723 issued December 15, 1970 to Gresham;
3,556,907 issued January 19, 1971 to Nystrand; 3,708,366 issued January
2, 1973 to Donnelly; 3,738,905 issued June 12, 1973 to Thomas; 3,867,225
issued February 18, 1975 to Nystrand and 4,483,728 issued November 20,
1984 to Bauernfeind. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent Des. 239,137 issued
March 9, 1976 to Appleman illustrates an emboss pattern found on
commercially successful paper toweling.The consumer presented with an embossed cellulosic fibrous structure
as a consumer product typically desires the product to have a high
quality cloth-like appearance, to have a relatively thick caliper and to
have an aesthetically pleasing pattern. All of these attributes must be
provided without sacrificing the consumer products' other desired
qualities of softness, absorbency, and bond strength

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing a cellulosic fibrous structure having two laminae joined in
face-to-face relationship, said process comprising the steps of:


providing two laminae to be joined in face-to-face relationship;
providing an apparatus having two pattern rolls, each with a periphery and radially oriented
protruberances extending therefrom to distal ends, said pattern rolls juxtaposed in axially

parallel relationship to form a first nip therebetween; and
forming said laminae through said nip defined by said pattern rolls, whereby each said
lamina is joined to and contacts the other said lamina at a plurality of sites coincident with

the distal ends of said protruberances,

characterised in that the distal ends of the protruberances of each said pattern roll contact
the periphery of the other said pattern roll so both laminae are compacted between the

distal ends of the protruberances of one said pattern roll and the periphery of the other
said pattern roll.
A process according to claim 1 further comprising the steps of :

providing a pressure roll juxtaposed in axially parallel relationship with one said pattern roll

to form a second nip therebetween; 
providing an adhesive applicator roll juxtaposed in axially parallel
relationship with said pattern roll having such second nip to

form a third nip between said adhesive applicator roll and said
pattern roll;
providing a supply of adhesive to said applicator roll;
forwarding one said lamina through said second nip formed between
said pressure roll and said pattern roll whereby said

protuberances of said pattern roll emboss said lamina against
said pressure roll;
forwarding said lamina through said third nip between said adhesive
applicator roll and said pattern roll to apply adhesive to said

lamina in a predetermined pattern; and
adhesively joining said laminae together to form a cellulosic
fibrous structure.
A process according to Claim 2 further comprising the steps of:

providing two pressure rolls, one said pressure roll juxtaposed in
axially parallel relationship with each said pattern roll to

form a nip therebetween;
providing two adhesive applicator rolls, one said adhesive
applicator roll juxtaposed in axially parallel relationship

with each said pattern roll to define a nip therebetween;
providing a supply of adhesive to each said applicator roll;
forwarding one said lamina through said nip formed between one said
pressure roll and one said pattern roll whereby said

protuberances of said pattern roll emboss said lamina against
said pressure roll;
forwarding the other said lamina through the nip formed between the
other said pressure roll and the other said pattern roll

whereby said protuberances of said pattern roll emboss said
lamina against said pressure roll;
forwarding each said lamina through said nip between said adhesive
applicator roll and said pattern roll to apply adhesive to said

laminae in a predetermined pattern; and
adhesively joining each said embossed site to the other said lamina.
A cellulosic fibrous structure having two laminae joined in face-to-face relationship, said
cellulosic fibrous structure comprising:


a first lamina having a nonembossed region and embossed sites projecting generally
outward therefrom;
a second lamina having a nonembossed region and embossed sites projecting generally
outward therefrom, whereby said embossed sites of at least one said lamina are joined to

said nonembossed region of said other lamina; and
an imaginary centroid plane intermediate said laminae and bisecting the space between
said nonembossed regions, whereby embossed sites from each said lamina traverse said

centroid plane,

characterised in that a plurality of said embossed sites of each lamina are joined to said
other lamina at a distal end which has been compressed.
