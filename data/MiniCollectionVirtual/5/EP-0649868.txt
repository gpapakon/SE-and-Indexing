<ABSTRACT>
A semi-interpenetrating polymer system made up of a 
mixture of a mo
isture-curable polymer component and a 
noncrosslinked elastomer component which when exposed to 

moisture becomes thermoset. The thermoset product is foamed 
and is suitable for sealing gaskets, sheet stock, tubing, and 

as a sealant-encapsulant among other end uses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to extrudable polymeric
compositions exhibiting elastomeric behavior and
especially suitable for use as sealants, gaskets,
moisture resistant electrically insulating
encapsulants, sheet stock and the like.A wide variety of natural and synthetic
rubbers and other elastomers have been used in the
prior art for sealing applications generally. For
example, Japanese Laid Open Application 59-213,786
published Dec. 2, 1984 discloses compositions
comprising 100 parts by weight of urethane foam
impregnated with 20-90 parts by weight of a mixture of
(a) styrene-butadiene or styrene-isoprene block
copolymers, (b) bituminous material and an organic
solvent, and, optionally, (c) paraffinic or aromatic
hydrocarbon oils, silicon water-repellents and/or
defoaming agents, and inorganic fillers.Japanese Laid Open Application 58-215,334
published Dec. 14, 1983 discloses a "water-swelling
sealant" comprising a rubber or plastic compound
blended with water swelling polyurethane resin. This
blend is mixed with an organic peroxide, molded or
extruded to any desired shape, then heated at 100-200Â°C.
to provide a durable water-swelling sealant.Japanese Laid Open Application 57-092,078
published June 8, 1982 discloses a sealing material
comprising a urethane polymer including a polydiene 
chain in the molecule and having terminal isocyanate
groups; this is mixed with a compound containing active
hydrogen. This mixture is eventually cured by urethane
reaction to form the final elastomer.The general possibility of polymer blends
constituting interpenetrating polymer networks or IPN's
has been known since 1969. Work in this field is
summarized in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and
Technology, Supplement Volume 1. The primary practical
improvement reported by use of such IPN's has been
increased toughness of elastomers and plastics.The extrudable polymeric compositions produced by the present invention
are made by blending at least two components: (a) a
first generally non-reactive thermoplastic synthetic
polymer with at least moderate flexibility, i.e. a
noncrosslinkable elastomer, namely
styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene
block copolymer
and (b) a second polymer or
oligomer having end groups capable of further reaction
with one another under the influence of atmospheric
moisture, e.g. 10-100% relative humidity for at least 5
minutes, i.e. a primary polymer having a polyester backbone and isocyanate
end groups. The materials are extruded into the desired shape in
which they are to be finally used while

<CLAIMS>
A polymeric composition formed from a mixture comprising:

a) a first component which is a styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block polymer and is a
non-crosslinked elastomer that is not substantially chemically reactive with itself or

with the second component (as recited below) in the presence of moisture;
b) a second component which is a primary polymer having a polyester backbone and
isocyanate end groups that are capable of chemically reacting with each other in the

presence of moisture to form a derivative polymer having a longer average chain
length than said primary polymer;

which polymeric composition is formed by intimately mixing said first and said
second components, then extruding said mixture, and then curing said mixture by

exposure to moisture, wherein said mixture after cure by exposure to moisture forms
an essentially thermoset interpenetrating network.
The polymeric composition according to claim 1, in the form of a sheet or a tape.
The polymeric composition according to claim 1, in the form of tubing.
The polymeric composition according to claim 1, in the form of a gasket.
