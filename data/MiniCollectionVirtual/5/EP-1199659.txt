<ABSTRACT>
A manufacturing information providing system is provided. The
system makes it possible to efficiently plan manufacturing information to

improve manufacturing achievements. The system enables a
manufacturing plant to manufacture a desired high-level product in a short

time even if the plant has no know-how to manufacture it. Manufacturing
information is obtained by planning and/or preparing a manufacturing

machine, a manufacturing process, arrangements or the like necessary for
the business of a user 1 engaged in manufacturing products. The obtained

information is packaged and provided to the user through a communication
medium 6, such as electronic mail or a home page on the Internet, or a

portable storage medium 7, such as an FD, a CD, an MO or a DVD.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing information
providing system, on which a server engaged in the planning, creation
(preparation) and/or provision of manufacturing information provides a
user as a manufacturer with manufacturing information planned and/or
created on a manufacturing process, a setup and/or the like by the server at
the user's request.In general, in order to manufacture products efficiently and
economically in a short time in manufacturing plants, it is necessary to
study and/or examine what kinds of machines, tools, jigs, work (cutting
materials), gauges (measuring instruments), processes and setups
(arrangements) should be used.Therefore, conventionally, suitable or adequate manufacturing
machines have been selected and manufacturing processes, setups, etc.
have been planned and created to manufacture intended or expected
products, and the products have been manufactured based on
manufacturing information including the contents thus planned and created.
In many case, such manufacturing information has been planned
exclusively by the personnel in charge of the production technique etc. or
the operators of the production equipment in manufacturing plants.In recent years, however, the trends of personnel cut etc. in the 
departments of production technique of manufacturing plants due to
corporate rationalization for economical reasons etc. have decreased the
number of experienced staffs having manufacturing know-how, and have
made it impossible to spare enough time to plan manufacturing information.
This has occasionally made the contents of the planned information
inadequate. The manufacturing efficiency may be worsened due to the
surplus of time spent on the setup of manufacturing equipment on the part
of the operators. Under the existing circumstances, it is difficult to
undertake high standards of production equal to or beyond the levels of the
manufacturing know-how owned by the manufacturing plants.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a
manufacturing information providing system on which a server engaged in
the planning, creation (preparation) and provision of manufacturing
information can efficiently plan manufacturing information to improve the
manufacturing achievements, and on which a manufacturing plant can
manufacture a desired high-level product in a short time even if the plant
has no know-how to manufacture it.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
manufacturing information providing system on which a user as a
manufactur

<CLAIMS>
A manufacturing information providing system on which a server
engaged in planning, preparing or providing manufacturing information

obtains manufacturing information by planning and/or preparing a
manufacturing machine, a manufacturing process, arrangements or the like

necessary for the business of a user engaged in manufacturing products,
packages the obtained information, and provides the user with the

packaged information through a communication medium, such as
electronic mail or a home page on the Internet, or a portable storage

medium, such as an FD, a CD, an MO or a DVD.
A manufacturing information providing system on which a server
engaged in planning, preparing or providing manufacturing information

receives, from a user engaged in manufacturing products, manufacturing
information obtained by the user planning and/or preparing a

manufacturing machine, a manufacturing process, arrangements or the like
for use in the manufacture by the user, in packaged form through a

communication medium, such as electronic mail or a home page on the
Internet, or a portable storage medium, such as an FD, a CD, an MO or a

DVD, and accumulates the received information.
A manufacturing information providing system on which a server
engaged in planning, preparing or providing manufacturing information

receives, from a user engaged in manufacturing products, manufacturing
information obtained by the user planning and/or preparing a

manufacturing machine, a manufacturing process, arrangements or the like
for use in the manufacture by the user, in packaged form through a

communication medium, such as electronic mail or a home page on the
Internet, or a portable storage medium, such as an FD, a CD, an MO or a

DVD, checks, analyzes and examines the received information,
subsequently makes an improvement such as a correction or an addition in

the manufacturing information required for the manufacturing object of the
user, packages the improved information again, and provides the packaged

information to the user.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 3, wherein the packaged manufacturing information

comprises pieces of information associated with each other.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein the manufacturing information is information

about a working process for a machine tool or the like.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein the manufacturing information is information

about an assembly process.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein the manufacturing information is information

about a measuring process.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein information about a dynamic picture image, a

still picture image or a drawing is added to the manufacturing information.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein the manufacturing information is information

about at least one of a tool, a jig, work, a gauge, an NC program, process
instructions therefor, working instructions therefor, a working manual

therefor, assembly instructions therefor, an assembly manual therefor,
measuring instructions therefor and a measuring manual therefor.
The manufacturing information providing system defined in any
one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein the manufacturing information is sent and
