<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing an aqueous calcium-sulphate based suspension, particularly for use as a filler or coating pigment in paper manufacturing, wherein a calcium sulphate slurry is formed by means of a first viscosity-regulating additive containing a copolymer which is obtained from at least two different kinds of ethylene monomers, a second viscosity-regulating additive including an alkali metal phosphate or polyphosphate, and optionally a third viscosity-regulating additive containing a cellulose ether, the amount of added viscosity-regulating additive being such that the viscosity is 250-2500 mPa.s, preferably 500-2000 mPa.s, and that the concentration of solid matter is 60-77 %, preferably 66-72 %.
