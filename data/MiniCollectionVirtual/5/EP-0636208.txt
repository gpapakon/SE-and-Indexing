<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal combustion
engines and more particularly to an engine provided with
a fuel preheater to increase engine efficiency over
a range of operating conditions and reduce emissions.In a conventional reciprocating internal combustion
engine, a cylinder block is provided with a plurality of
cylinders therein, each containing a piston and 
connection means which reciprocates within the cylinder
to drive a crankshaft. A cylinder head is positioned on
the cylinder block to create a number of combustion
chamber zones each of which is associated with one of the
cylinders. The combustion chamber zones include inlet
valve means which control, through a complete range of
power, the flow of fuel/air into the cylinder prior to
combustion and exhaust valve means for controlling the
flow of exhaust gases which result from the combustion.
The valve "lift" or "stroke" is the degree of opening of
the inlet and exhaust valves. This opening is generally
regulated by a valve train means comprising a camshaft
containing an eccentric lobe. The lobe has a profile
which directly affects the length of opening of the
valve. Since the size and configuration of the lobe is
static, the motion delivered to the valve for lift or
length of stroke will be constant except for minor
adjustments of valve lash.Thus, conventional valve stroke arrangements for
internal combustion engines often compromise engine
performance as the engine revolutions per minute (RPM)
vary. Generally speaking, more powerful engines are
designed with a relatively longer stroke camshaft
allowing such engines to develop maximum horsepower and
torque at higher RPM's with a proportionate reduction in
terms of overall fuel economy. Conversely, the more fuel 
efficient engines generally have a shorter valve stroke
camshaft which concentrates horsepower and torque at
lower engine RPMs however, such engines lack the ability
to generate high usable power. Consequently,
conventional engine design has the effect of positioning
a point of maximum efficiency either higher up or lower
down on the RPM scale of the engine.Variable stroke valve train mechanisms have been
proposed in the prior art. U.S. Patent 4,911,124
(Bennett) discloses a device which includes an adjustable
fulcrum point which is positioned beneath the valve
rocker arm in order to vary the stroke of the cylinder
valve. U.S. Patent 4,986,227 (Dewey, III) discloses a
device to adjust valve lift in response to engine RPM by
designing a rocker arm with a convex fulcrum-engaging
