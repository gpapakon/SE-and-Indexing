<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved lubricating oil composition for automotive internal combustion engines and transmission which comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity having admixed therewith a minor amount of friction modifier composition which reduces the coefficient of friction between moving mechanical parts, thereby providing for enhanced fuel economy. The friction modifier composition comprises a combination of an alkoxylated hydrocarbyl amine and a polyol partial ester of a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid or mixture of such esters, each preferably present in the range of from about 0.1 to about 1.0 % by weight based on the weight of the oil. This combination of components provides for synergistic fuel economy effects particularly when used as components in automotive crankcase lubricants also containing conventional additive packages, which effects are not observed in oil which contains one or the other of these components alone.

 LUBRICANT COMPOSITION CONTAINING MIXED FRICTIONMODIFIERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to lubricating oil compositions which exhibit enhanced fuel economy and which contain a minor amount of the friction modifier combination of a poly fatty acid ester and an alkoxylated. hydrocarbylamine.2. Description of Related ArtIt is an objective of the automotive and oil industry to provide lubricating oil compositions which exhibit improvements in fuel savings in gasoline and diesel engine vehicles. In order to meet these goals, additives have been developed for crankcase and transmission oils which significantly reduce friction between engine or transmission moving parts, which reduction translates into improved mileage per volume of fuel consumed by an internal combustion engine. Because modern day lubricating oil compositions are complex formulations, such additives must be compatible with other components present in the oil and should not adversely affect the numerous other functions of conventional lubricant additives such as 

dispersancy, Viscosity stability, corrosion, oxidation inhibition and the like.Representative examples of known oil additive modifiers are found in U.S. Patent No. 3,933,659 which discloses fatty acid esters and amides; U.S. Patent No. 4,176,074 which describes molybdenum complexes of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride-a ino alkanols; U.S. Patent 4,105,571 which discloses glycerol esters of dimerized fatty acids; U.S. Patent No. 3,779,928 which discloses alkane phosphonic acid salts; U.S. Patent No. 3,778,375 which discloses reaction products of a phosphonate and oleamide; U.S. Patent No. 3,852,215 which discloses S-carboxy-alkγlene hydrocarbyl succinimide, S-carboxyalkγlene hydrocarbyl succinic acid and mixtures thereof; U.S. Patent 3,879,306 which discloses N-(hydroxy-alkγl) alkenyl-succinamic acids or succinimides; U.S. Patent No. 3,932,290 which discloses reaction products of di-(lower alkyl) phosphites and epoxides; and U.S. Patent No. 4,028,258 which discloses the alkylene oxide adduct of phosphosulfurized N-(hydroxγalkγl) alkenyl succinimides.Another known category of friction modifiers includes alkoxylated hydrocarbyl mono or polyamines such as generally illustrated by formulas 1 and 2 below. These amines include materials such as N,N-bis(2-hydroxyalkyl) hydrocarbyl amines such as disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,711,406, 3,796,662, 3,933,659, 4,010,106, 4,129,508, 4,170,560, 4,231,883 and 4,795,583. 

Polyol fatty acid esters are also
