<ABSTRACT>
A tilter (1) for turning over rolling stock (W) consists of a tilting head (2) which is equipped with grippers, can be adjusted in rotation about a tilting axis (I) determined by the gripper (3) gripping the rolling stock (W) and is supported on a lifting device (6) of a cross-slide (10) that can be moved transversely to the tilting axis (I). In order to achieve a simple, robust construction and efficient tilting, the tilting head (2) is mounted so as to be rotatable about a tilting-head axis (II) parallel to the tilting axis (I), the tilting head (2), the lifting device (6) and the cross-slide (10) have their own drives (7, 11, 14), and these drives (7, 11, 14) can be controlled by means of a numerical control (15) to give the respective tilting movement from a combination of rotary, lifting and transverse motion components.

A manipulator (1) for rotating rolled stock (W) 
and comprising a tilting head (2) equipped with 

grippers and adjustable in rotation around a tilting 
axis (I) defined by the gripper (3) gripping the rolled 

stock (W), said head (2) bearing against a lifting 
device (6) on a cross slide (10) movable transversely 

to the tilting axis (I), wherein the tilting head (2) 
is mounted for rotation around a tilting-head axis (II) 

parallel to the tilting axis (I), characterised in that 
the tilting head (2), the lifting device (6) and the 

cross slide (10) have separate drives (7, 11, 14) and 
these drives (7, 11, 14) are actuated via a numerical 

control system (15) so as to make up the respective 
tilting motion out of rotary, lifting and transverse 

components of motion. 
A manipulator according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the respective actual positions of the tilting 

head (2), the lifting device (6) and the cross slide 
(10) can be read into the control device (15) via 

travel sensors, more particularly angle increment 
sensors (16, 17, 18). 
A manipulator according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the lifting device comprises a 

vertical slide (6) movable in straight guides (9) on 
the cross slide (10).
