<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an internal combustion engine (1) having at least two cylinder banks (2, 3) which are all charged via a single exhaust gas turbo charger (11). However, the turbo charger (11) is only supplied with the exhaust gas of a first cylinder bank (2). The exhaust gas of the other cylinder banks (3) is fed to the pipe (22) and via an ejector nozzle (23) of an ejector chamber (21) into which the line (20) from the outflow side (19) of the turbine of the exhaust gas turbo charger (11) leads. The flow energy of the exhaust gases out of the pipe (22) is converted in the ejector chamber (21) into a pressure difference which acts on the turbine (13) of the exhaust gas turbo charger (11) as an increased difference in pressure and increases its power. By means of the ejector nozzle (23), the counterpressure of the exhaust gas is increased in the same way as by the turbine of the exhaust gas charger (11) so that all the cylinders (4) are uniformly loaded. Such an internal combustion engine in which the cylinder banks are advantageously arranged in a V shape but in which any other arrangement of the cylinder banks is also conceivable can be realized in a very compact way and is thus particularly suitable for mounting in limited installation spaces, e.g. in engine spaces of motor vehicles.
