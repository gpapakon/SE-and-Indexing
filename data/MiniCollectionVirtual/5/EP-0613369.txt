<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to compositions which provide both a skin cleansing and skin moisturizing benefit from the same product. These compositions provide improved lathering and cleansing characteristics, are extremely mild to the skin, and deliver a moisturizing agent to the skin. These compositions comprise at least one anionic surfactant, a dispersed, insoluble oil phase, at least one additional surfactant, an optional suspending agent, and water. This invention also relates to methods for providing combined cleansing and moisturization, and to methods for delivering these compositions as a foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMBINED PERSONAL CLEANSING AND MOISTURIZING COMPOSITIONSTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to compositions which provide both a skin cleansing and skin moisturizing benefit from the same product. These compositions provide improved lathering and cleansing characteristics, are extremely mild to the skin, and upon rinse-off deliver a moisturizing agent to the skin. These compositions comprise at least one anionic surfactant, a dispersed, insoluble oil phase, at least one additional surfactant selected from nonionic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactants, an optional suspending agent, and water. This invention also relates to methods for providing combined cleansing and moisturization, and to methods for delivering these compositions as a foam.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCleansing compositions must satisfy a number of criteria including cleansing power, foaming properties, and mildness/low irritancy with respect to the skin, hair and the occular mucosae.Skin is made up of several layers of cells which coat and protect the keratin and collagen fibrous proteins that form the skeleton of its structure. The outermost of these layers, referred to as the stratum corneum, is known to be composed of 250 I diameter protein bundles surrounded by 80 A thick bilayers of epidermal lipids and water. Anionic surfactants can penetrate the stratum corneum membrane and, by delipidization (i.e. removal of the lipids from the stratum corneum), destroy its integrity. This destruction of the stratum corneum bilayers can lead to dry rough skin and may eventually permit the surfactant to interact with the viable epidermis, creating irritation.Ideal cosmetic cleansers should cleanse the skin gently, causing little or no irritation without defatting and or drying the skin and without leaving skin taut after frequent use. Most lathering soaps, liquids and bars fail in this respect. Also, most current cleansing products do not deliver an adequate 

 moisturizing benefit during cleansing. Therefore, users typically must moisturize their skin in a separate step following cleansing. Certain synthetic surfactants are known to be mild. However, a major drawback of most mild synthetic surfactant systems, when formulated for skin cleansing, is poor lather performance compared to the highest bar soap standards (bars which are rich in coconut soap and superfatted). On the other hand, the use of known high sudsing anionic surfactants with lather boosters can yield acceptable lather volume and quality. Unfortunately, however, the
