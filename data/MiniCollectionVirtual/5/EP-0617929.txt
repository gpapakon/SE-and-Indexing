<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring and indicating the onset of parturition of a horse. The rapid temporal rise in sweating (sudation) of the mother animal shortly before the birth is used as an indicator for the start of the birth. The sweating of the mother animal is monitored by a sensor. Subsequently, the measurement signal is processed by a signal filter in such a way that long-term changes in sweating are filtered out and rapid temporal changes are amplified. A device for carrying out the method provides a sensor, a signal filter, a limit monitor (comparator) and a holding circuit.
