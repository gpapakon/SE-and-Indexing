<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for reproducing data recorded on a disc (10), having 
a head part (12) for reading out the data from the disc, storage parts 

(17, 18) for storing the data read out by the head part, and a control 
part (15) which so pre-reads the data from the disc that the reproducing 

apparatus can output the data continuously to the outside during the 
seeking operation of the head part, stores the data in the storage parts, and 

controls the outputting of the date from the storage parts to the outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk
reproducing apparatus, and more particularly to an
apparatus and method for reproducing data from a disk,
and a disk.Conventionally, a game using an apparatus for
reproducing data from a disk is played so that data
regarding a game, such as video and sound, is recorded
on a CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only Memory), an LD-ROM
(Laser Disk Read Only Memory) or the like and is
reproduced therefrom in the progress of the game.Conventionally, data regarding a driving game
is recorded as follows. As shown in Fig. 1, if a route
AB branches out into a route BC and BD, data regarding
the routes AB and BC are recorded on the CD-ROM
according to sequential address values so that the
above data can be sequentially reproduced, and data
regarding the route BD is recorded thereon according to
address values discontinuous to those for the route AB.In a conventional apparatus for reproducing
data from a disk, if the route BC is continuously
selected after the route AB, the video and sound of the
game can be continuously reproduced because the data
regarding the route BC is recorded according to the
address values continuing to those for the route AB.
However, if the route BD is continuously selected after 
the route AB, a seek operation is needed in which an
optical head is moved, after reproducing the data
regarding the route AB, to the address in which data
regarding the route BD is recorded. Hence, video and
sound are interrupted or stopped during the interval
between the completion of reproduction of the data
regarding the route AB and the commencement of
reproduction of the data regarding the route BD.The present invention was made taking into
account the above, and has an object of providing an
apparatus and method for reproducing data from a disk,
a method for recording data on a disk, and a disk in
which the outputting of data is not interrupted but can
be continuously carried out during a seek operation of
a head for reading data regarding a branching part.The object of the invention is achieved by the apparatus according to
claim 1, the method of claim 3 and the medium claim 5. Fig. 1 is a diagram for explaining an example
of a course displayed on a screen in a play of a
driving game;Fig. 2 is a diagram for explaining a
conventional recording formation on a disk;Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a disk apparatus
according to an embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 4 is a diagram for explaining a course

<CLAIMS>
A data reproducing apparatus for reproducing data recorded on a
disk-shaped recording medium (10), said data relating to a computer

software program having a branching point at which a branching operation
is executed in response to an input at a controller (21),

   said data comprising:

first data for performing said program up to said
branching point and immediately beyond said branching point if a

branching operation is not executed, and
second data for performing said program immediately
after said branching point if a branching operation is executed, wherein said

first data up to the branching point and the second data are recorded in a continuous
area on the disk-shaped medium prior to the first data immediately beyond the branching point,

   said apparatus comprising:

data reading means (12, 14, 15) for reading said data sequentially
from said disk shaped recording medium and for performing a seek

operation when a branching operation is executed (10);
storage means (17, 18) for storing the data read by said data reading
means (12, 14, 15); and
control means (15) adapted for 

(a) writing into said storage means (17, 18) as ordinary data,
said first data which is used by said program immediately prior to said

branching point and immediately after said branching point if a branching
operation is not executed,
(b) writing into said storage means as pre-read data, said second data which
is to be used by said program immediately after said branching point when

a branching operation is executed and
(c) for reading the pre-read data from the storage means (17, 18)
when said data reading means (12, 14, 15) is in the seek operation after the

branching operation is executed.
A data reproducing apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said
disk shaped recording medium carries a designation designating said first

data as ordinary data and designating said second data as pre-read data, said
designation being readable by said reproducing apparatus.
A disk data reproducing method for reproducing data recorded on a
disk-shaped recording medium by data reading means which performs a

seek operation when a branching operation is executed at a branching point
by a computer software program utilising the data in response to an input

from a controller, wherein

   said disk data reproducing method comprising the steps of:

reading from the disk-shaped recording medium first data to be used
by said program prior to said branching point and immediately after said

branching point if a branching operation is not executed, and writing the
first data into the storage means as ordinary data; 
reading from the disk-shaped recording medium second data to be
used by said program immediately after said branching point when a

branching operation is executed and writing the second data into the
storage means as pre-read data;
 wherein said first data up to the branching
point and the second data are recorded in a continuous area on the disk-shaped

medium prior to the first data immediately beyond the branching point;
and outputting the pre-read data from the storage means when the data

reading means is performing a seek operation when a branching operation
has been executed.
A disk data reproducing method as claimed in claim 3, wherein
said disk shaped recording medium carries a designation designating said

first data as ordinary data and designating said second data as pre-read data,
said designation being read by said reproducing apparatus.
A disk-shaped recording medium on which data, for a computer
software program which is capable of executing a branching operation at a

branching point, is recorded, said data comprising:

first ordinary data which is used by said program before said
branching point,
second ordinary data which is used by said program immediately
after said branching point if a branching operation is not executed, and
pre-read data that is used by said program immediately after said
branching point if said branching operation is executed;

   wherein said first ordinary data and said pre-read data are recorded in
a continuous area on the disc shaped recording medium prior to said second

ordinary data.
