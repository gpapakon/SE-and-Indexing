<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the
invention provides progressive addition lenses designed for uses in which a large region
of intermediate refractive power is desirable.The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known. For
example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses ("PAL's"), are used for
the treatment of presbyopia. The surface of a PAL provides far, intermediate, and near
vision zones in a gradual, continuous progression of vertically increasing dioptric power
from far to near focus, or top to bottom of the lens. PAL's are appealing to the wearer
because PAL's are free of the visible ledges between the zones of differing dioptric
power that are found in other multifocal lenses, such as bifocals and trifocals.A number of activities require an especially large intermediate refractive power
zone, which the typical PAL does not contain. For example, in viewing an image screen,
such as a computer screen, an enlarged intermediate vision zone is desirable to avoid the
need for the lens wearer to move the head from side to side to view the screen. Several
customized, multifocal lens designs are known that provide an enlarged intermediate
vision zone However, these designs completely or partially sacrifice the far vision zone
in order to provide the enlarged intermediate vision zone. Additionally, the intermediate
vision zone of these designs is at least partially above the 0-180 degree axis of the lens
causing the lens wearer to have to tilt the head forward in order to use this zone in
visualizing an image screen.Other designs, such as disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,762,408, provide
a wider intermediate vision zone, but only by increasing the channel length to 20 mm or
more and by placing the near vision zone optical center at a point that does not permit 
the lens wearer's pupil to access it without discomfort or head movement. Thus, a need
exists for a PAL that overcomes some of the problems of these known designs .FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a lens surface.FIG. 2 is an isocylinder map of the lens of Example 1.FIG. 3 is a contour map of the lens of Example 1.FIG. 4 is an isocylinder map of the lens of Example 2.FIG. 5 is a contour map of the lens of Example 2.FIG. 6 is an isocylinder map of the lens of Example 3.FIG. 7 is a contour map of the lens of Example 3.FIG. 8 is an isocylinder map of the lens of Example 4.FIG. 9 is a contour map of the lens of Example 4.The present invention provides

<CLAIMS>
A progressive addition lens comprising at least one surface comprising a far vision
zone, a near vision zone, and a channel which is the zone of increasing dioptric power that is free of unwanted astigmatism of about 0.75 diopters or greater and which connects the far vision zone with the near vision zone, wherein the width of the far vision zone is about

equal to or greater than the width of the channel and the width of the
channel is about equal to or greater than the width of the near vision zone

and wherein the lens has a maximum, unwanted astigmatism of less than about 80 percent
of the dioptric add power, 
characterised in that
 the channel has a length of
about 19 nm or less.
The lens of claim 1, wherein the lens is a spectacle lens.
The lens or any one of Claims 1 to 2, wherein the unwanted astigmatism is 40 to 80
percent of the dioptric add power.
The lens of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein:

the width of the far vision zone is about equal to the width of the channel and the
width of the channel is about equal to or greater than the width of the near

vision zone; or
the width of the far vision zone is about equal to the width of the channel and the
width of the channel is about equal to the width of the near vision zone; or

the width of the far vision zone is greater than the width of the channel and the
width of the channel is about equal to or greater than the width of the near

vision zone; or
the width of the far vision zone is greater than the width of the channel and the
width of the channel is greater than the width of the near vision zone.
A method comprising the step of designing a lens having at least one progressive
surface, wherein the entire progressive surface is optimized as a whole and a channel

power gradient of about 0.12 diopters/mm or less is used,
 
wherein the lens is a progressive addition lens comprising

at least one surface comprising a far vision zone, a near vision zone, and a channel ,which is the zone of increasing dioptric power that is free of unwanted astigmatism of about 0.75 diopters or greater and which connects the far vision zone with the near vision zone,
wherein the width of the far vision zone is about equal to or greater than the width of the

channel and the width of the channel is about equal to or greater
than the width of the near vision zone and wherein the lens has a maximum, unwanted

astigmatism of less than about 80 percent of the dioptric add power,

characterised in that
 the channel has a length of about 19 mm or less.
