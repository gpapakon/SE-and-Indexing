<ABSTRACT>
A vaccinal efficacy augmentor comprises an IgA production 
promoter having an IgA production promoting effect as its 

effective component. The promoter is able to augment the 
efficacy of pathogenic virus vaccines. When administered with 

vaccines which contain bacteria or bacilli or virus antigens 
and which have the purpose of inducing immunity against 

infectious diseases, the IgA production promoter stimulates IgA 
producing cells such as Peyer's patch cells to promote secretory 

IgA production. Eventually, the production of an antibody 
against the antigen in the vaccine is augmented to well induce 

protective immunity and augment the efficacy of the vaccine. 
In addition, the augmentor can suppress side effects of the 

vaccine. The efficacy augmenting foods comprising the promoter 
ar
e also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an augmentor for vaccinal 
efficacy comprising, as an effective component, an IgA 
production promoter, e.g. bacteria belonging to the genus 
Bifidobacterium, which has a good IgA production augmenting 
efficacy and also to efficacy-augmenting foods. A number of patients have suffered infectious diseases 
caused by pathogenic viruses every year not only in developing 
countries, but also in advanced countries. Especially, such 
diseases are a main cause for death of infants and young 
children. For instance, there have been about several millions of 
victims including infants every year owing to the rotavirus-infected 
disease. In Japan, influenza has been vigorously 
prevailing in every several years. For treatment of these 
infectious diseases, there have been developed various types of 
anti-virus agents and vaccines using viral antigens. However, the development of any appropriate anti-virus 
agent or vaccine has never been in success for certain types of 
pathogenic viruses. The present inventors have already developed a method for 
searching a substance, which expedites the production of  
 
secretory IgA useful for biophylaxy, by use of Pyer's patch 
cells. Using this method, an IgA production promoter has been 
found as comprising, as its effective component, bacteria 
belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium having a good IgA 
production promoting action (Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Application No. 280059/1990). The term "IgA production promoter having the good IgA 
production promoting action" used herein is intended to mean 
that in the searching method set out hereinabove, an index 
ratio (incrementing ratio) of the amount of secretory IgA 
secreted from IgA producing cells in a culture solution after 
cultivation over 7 days to the amount of secretory IgA of a 
non-added group of a substance to be tested (prior to the 
cultivation) is not smaller than 12. In order to further augment the IgA production promoting 
efficacy of the IgA production promoter, an attempt has been 
made wherein the bifidobacteria are protoplasted to take out 
the cytoplasmic membrane thereof (Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Application No. 139469/1991). The present inventors have found that when the bacteria 
belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium and having a good IgA 
production promoting action are dosed along with vaccines 
(pathogenic virus antigen), the production in amount of a 
specific antibody corresponding to the virus antigen 
significantly increased, thus augmenting an infection
