<ABSTRACT>
A castor control mechanism for a hospital bed 
having a plunger type neutral/brake/steer castor 

comprises a linkage including a rocker arm (61) pivotally 
mounted to the base of the bed, a link (55) connected on one 

end to the rocker arm (61) and being connected on its other 
end through a cam and follower mechanism to a shaft 

rotatably mounted to the base and rotatable by a foot 
pedal. Operation of the foot pedal (52) moves the plunger of 

the castor via the rocker arm (61) to place the castor in its 
steer, neutral and brake positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to hospital
beds. More particularly, this invention relates to a
control mechanism for controlling the castors on the base
of the hospital bed, and more specifically for selecting
a particular operating mode for the castors.Hospital beds, whether of the medsurg type,
stretcher type of birthing type, have heretofore been
provided with castors mounted around the base for rolling
the bed from place to place. At least one of the
castors, and usually two, have at least two operating
modes. In most cases, one of the castors will have three
operating modes.More particularly, at least one of the castors
is of the type having three operating modes, known as
"neutral" "brake", and "steer". In the neutral mode, the
castor is free to swivel. In the brake mode, the brake
castor pad is pressed against the surface of the castor
wheel to prevent it from rotating. In the steer mode,
the castor is locked against swiveling movement, and
aligned parallel to the longitudinal dimension of the bed 
so that the bed can be pushed straight down a hallway
without the bed drifting to one side or the other. In
two operating mode castors, the steer mode or function is
eliminated, and the castor simply has neutral and brake
modes.Two types of castors, each of which includes
the capability of having the above three operating modes,
have been employed in hospital beds. The simplest type
is known as a "plunger" type castor. In this type of
castor, the castor spindle is spring loaded upwardly and
normally maintains the castor locked in the steer mode.
Depressing the spindle through a first displacement frees
the castor from its steer mode and places it into its
free-to-swivel neutral mode. Depressing the spindle
through a second displacement places the castor in its
brake mode by forcing the castor brake against the castor
wheel thereby stopping castor wheel rotation.A more expensive castor which likewise includes
the steer, neutral and brake modes is the "cam" type
castor. In the cam type castor, there is an additional
housing located above the spindle which houses a cam.
The cam normally includes a hex-shaped through-bore for
cooperation with a similarly hex-shaped shaft. The hex-shaped
shaft is inserted through the cam hex bore, and
rotation of the shaft rotates the cam, the lobes of which
then move the spindle through the required displacements
hence moving the castor from the steer to the neutral
mode and from the neutral mode to the brake mode. Hospital beds which have employed plunger type
castors

<CLAIMS>
A hospital bed (10) comprising a base (11), a
patient support (18) mounted above the base (11), castors

(12a - d) mounted around the base (11) and including at
least one plunger type castor (12a, 12c) having a plunger

(65) actuable to provide neutral, brake and steer modes, and, a
linkage (45) for actuating the plunger (65) and

selectively positioning the plunger type castor (12a,
12c) in the modes, characterised in that the linkage (45)

includes a rocker arm (61) for applying a downward force
on the plunger (65).
A hospital bed as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the linkage (45) comprises a shaft (46) mounted

transversely of and for rotation with respect to the base
(11), the rocker arm (61) which is pivotally mounted to

the base (11) and has first and second ends (61a, 61b),
the first end (61a) being adapted to actuate the plunger

type castor (12a, 12c), a link (55) having first and
second ends, the first link end being connected to the

second rocker arm end (61b), and, means operably
associated with the shaft (46) and the second link end

for transferring force between the second link end and
the shaft (46), whereby upon selective rotation of the

shaft (46) the link (55) pivots the rocker arm (61) to
selectively position the plunger type castor (12a, 12c)

in the castor modes. 
A hospital bed as claimed in Claim 2, wherein
the linkage further includes means (90) resisting

rotation of the shaft when the shaft is in respective
angular positions corresponding to the castor modes.
A hospital bed as claimed in Claim 3, wherein
the means resisting rotation of the shaft comprises a

housing (91) having a shaft bore (96) therethrough
rotatably supporting the shaft (46), a plunger (98)

slidably mounted in the housing (91) and spring biased
forward so as to project into the shaft bore (96), and, a

plurality of recesses (101, 102, 103) around the
circumference of the shaft (46), each of the recesses

(101, 102, 103) corresponding to one of the castor modes.
A hospital bed as claimed in any one of
Claims 2 to 4, wherein the operably associated means

comprises a cam (48) mounted on the shaft (46), and, a
cam follower (56, 58) mounted on the second link end for

cooperation with the cam (48).
A hospital bed as claimed in Claim 5, wherein
the cam is a crank (49) on the shaft (46) and the cam

follower is a plate (56) mounted on the second link end
having a notch (58) adapted to receive therein the crank

(49). 
A hospital bed as claimed in any one of
Claims 2 to 6, further including a pedal (51) on the

shaft (46) for foot actuation of the shaft (46) in first
and second directions.
