<ABSTRACT>
A process of producing a shaped article suitable for use as an automotive body panel intended for finishing by painting and, if necessary, baking. The process comprises obtaining a sheet article made of an aluminum alloy of the 2000 or 6000 series in a T4 or T4P temper and that exhibits an increase in hardness after painting and optionally baking, shaping the sheet article by forming to produce an intermediate shaped article, and subjecting the intermediate shaped article to a thermal spiking treatment prior to painting and optionally baking. The thermal spiking treatment involves heating the intermediate shaped article from ambient temperature to a temperature in a range of 150 to 300  DEG C with or without holding at that temperature for a period of time to enhance the increase in hardness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat treatment process for shaped articles, particularly
those suitable for use in the fabrication of automotive body panels. More particularly,
the invention relates to such articles made from aluminum alloy sheet material that
exhibits an improvement of hardness after painting and baking operations have been
carried out.Aluminum alloy sheet is being used more extensively nowadays as a structural
and closure sheet material for vehicle bodies as automobile manufacturers strive for
improved fuel economy by reducing vehicle weight. Traditionally, aluminum alloy is
either direct chill cast to form ingots or continuous cast in the form of a thick strip
material, and then hot rolled to a preliminary thickness. In a separate operation, the strip
is cold rolled to the final thickness and wound into coil. The coil must then undergo
solution heat treatment to allow strengthening of the formed panel during painting and
baking (steps usually carried out on shaped automotive parts by vehicle manufacturers or
others - also referred to as the paint bake or paint cure).Several aluminum alloys of the AA (Aluminum Association) 2000 and 6000
series are usually considered for automotive panel applications. The AA6000 series
alloys contain magnesium and silicon, both with and without copper but, depending upon
the Cu content, may be classified as AA2000 series alloys. These alloys are formable in
the T4 or T4P temper conditions and become stronger after painting and baking. Good
increases in strength after painting and baking are highly desirable so that thinner and
therefore lighter panels may be employed.It is highly desirable that the alloy sheet, when delivered to the manufacturer, be
relatively easily deformable so that it can be stamped or formed into products of the
required shapes without difficulty and without excessive springback. However, it is also
desirable that the products, once formed and subjected to the normal painting and baking
procedure, be relatively hard so that thin sheet can be employed and still provide good
dent resistance. To facilitate understanding, a brief explanation of the terminology used to
describe alloy tempers may be in order at this stage. The temper referred to as T4 is well
known (see, for example, Aluminum Standards and Data (1984), page 11, published by
The Aluminum Association) and refers to alloy produced in the conventional manner, i.e.
without intermediate batch annealing and pre-aging. This is the temper in which
automotive sheet panels are

<CLAIMS>
A process of producing a painted shaped article, involving obtaining a
sheet article made of an aluminum alloy of the 2000 or 6000 series in a T4

or T4P temper; shaping the article by bending or stamping the article to
form a non-planar shaped article; applying paint to the shaped article to

form a painted shaped article; and if necessary to further enhance hardness
of the painted shaped article and/or to cure the applied paint, baking the

article at a temperature of at least 177°C; 
characterized in that
 the shaped
article is subjected to a thermal spiking treatment before painting

involving heating the shaped article temporarily to a peak temperature in
the range of 150°C to 300°C.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said peak temperature
is within the range of 150 to 225°C.
A process according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said heating of the
shaped article is carried out at a rate in the range of 1 to 70°C/minute.
A process according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said
painted shaped article is subjected to said baking at a temperature of at

least 177°C to further enhance said hardness.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said peak temperature
is within the range of 225 to 300°C.
A process according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 said heating of said
shaped article is carried out at a rate in the range of 10 to 280°C/minute.
A process according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 said heating of said
shaped article is carried out at a rate in the range of 210 to 285°C/minute.
A process according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that
 said
shaped article is allowed to cool immediately after it reaches said peak

temperature during said thermal spiking treatment. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 said
shaped article is maintained at said peak temperature for a period of time

during said thermal spiking treatment before being allowed to cool.
A process according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 said period of time is
up to about 5 minutes.
A process according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that
 said
thermal spiking treatment is carried out in a continuous beat treatment

furnace.
A process according to claim 11, 
characterized in that
 said thermal spiking
treatment is carried out as a part of a continuous shaping and painting

process.
A shaped article suitable for use as an automotive part, 
characterized in
that
 said article has been produced by a process according to any
preceding claim.
