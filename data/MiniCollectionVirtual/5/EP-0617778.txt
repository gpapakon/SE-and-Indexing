Once-through flow steam generator comprising 
burners (11) for fossil fuels, having a vertical gas flue 

(1) comprising essentially vertically arranged tubes (2, 
3) whose inlet ends are connected to an inlet header (9) 

and whose outlet ends are connected to an outlet header 
(12),
 
characterised in that 


from each tube, above the burners (11) and at the 
same height H, a pressure equalisation tube (25) 

branches off which is connected to a pressure 
equalisation vessel (4) and, as a result, through 

part of the pressure equalisation tubes (25), a 
branch stream flows from the tubes (2) to the 

pressure equalisation vessel (4), and through 
another part of the pressure equalisation tubes (25) 

a branch stream flows from the pressure equalisation 
vessel 4 to the tubes (3), and in that 
the height H is selected such that in the event of 
an individual tube (2) receiving additional heating 

between the inlet header (9) and the branching-off 
point of the pressure equalisation tube (25), 

compared to the mean value of the heating of all the 
tubes (2), the mass flow through this individual 

tube increases. 
Once-through flow steam generator according to 
Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the tubes (2), over more than 50% 

of their length, internally have ribs which form a 
multiple thread. 
Once-through flow steam generator according to  
 

Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the tubes (2, 3) of the gas flue 

(1) are welded to one another in a gastight manner. 
Once-through flow steam generator according to 
one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 

height H is selected such that at a nominal load and with 
an individual tube receiving a% of additional heating 

between the inlet header (9) and the branching-off point 
of the pressure equalisation tube (25), compared to the 

mean value of the heating of all the tubes (2) which 
corresponds to 100%, the calculated mass flow through 

this individual tube (2) increases by at least 0.25 · a%. 
Once-through flow steam generator according to 
one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the height H 

is selected such that at a nominal load and with an 
individual tube (2) receiving a% of additional heating 

between the inlet header (9) and the branching-off point 
of the pressure equalisation tube (25), compared to the 

mean value of the heating of all the tubes (2) which 
corresponds to 100%, the calculated mass flow through 

this individual tube (2) increases by at least 0.50 · a%. 
Once-through flow steam generator according to 
one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the height H 

is selected such that at a nominal load and with an 
individual tube (2) receiving a% of additional heating 

between the inlet header (9) and the branching-off point 
of the pressure equalisation tube (25), compared to the 

mean value of the heating of all the tubes (2) which 
correspond to 100%, the calculated mass flow through this 

individual tube (2) increases by at least 0.75 · a%.
