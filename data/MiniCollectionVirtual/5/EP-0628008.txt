<ABSTRACT>
A packaging preform (1) made from fibre pulp material is intended to be placed on and to project a corner of an article, placed e.g. in a corrugated-paper box, and comprising a substantially plane base with a number of hollow raised portions or projections, between which there are an incision line (5) and folding lines (3, 4), about which four square-shaped panels (6, 7, 8, 9) of the packaging preform can be folded so as to form the finished corner protector (not shown), one (9) of these panels being a locking panel, the projections of which are adapted to be in locking engagement with recesses in the rear side of the packaging preform (1) corresponding to the projections on another panel (6). The projections on each side panel (6, 7, 8) are shaped and situated in such a manner, that in the finished corner protector, especially in the region of the corner point, they engage each other in such a manner, that they lie close together and give each other support.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PACKAGING PREFORM OF PULP MATERIAL FOR MAKING A CORNER PROTECTORX-TECHNICAL FIELD 5 The present invention relates to a packaging preform of the kind set forth in the preamble of Claim 1.Such a preform is used for making a corner protector intended to be placed around a corner on e.g. a box- 10 shaped article in order to protect said corner against impact during handling and transport, as the corner protector, when subject to impact, will absorb the energy of the impact by elastic or permanent deformation.15 BACKGROUND ARTA corner protector of the kind referred to above is known from DE published specification No. 3 010 066. This corner protector is produced from thin plastic material, which in certain countries can give rise to20 problems, when the used corner protector is to be disposed of as waste material. Further, plastic is a homogeneous material, the permanent deformation of which occurs in the form of sudden local weakenings in the side walls of the projections, providing no substantial25 absorption of impact energy.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIt is the object of the present invention to avoid these disadvantages and to provide a packaging preform making30 it possible to produce a corner protector exhibiting no problems with regard to disposal of wast material, said corner protector being able to absorb a substantial amount of impact energy, both by elastic deformation and especially by permanent (plastic) deformation of35 the raised portions or projections. 

The object stated above is achieved with a packaging element of the kind referred to initially, additionally exhibiting the features set forth the characterizing clause of Claim 1. Since the packaging preform is produced from fibre pulp material, it is possible after • the use of the corner protector to recycleythe material or destroy it without problems by burning, and this material - is also bio-degradable. In contrast to the plastic material used in the packaging preform referred to above, the material used in the packaging preform according to the present invention is inhomogeneous and consists of a great number of inter-entangled fibres, for which reason the permanent deformation of the projections partially takes place in the form of a local disintegration of these fibres, enabling the material to absorb a substantial quantity of impact energy. This effect is further enhanced by the special arrangement of the projections in the region of the corner point, enabling the projections to support each other.The embodiments of the packaging
