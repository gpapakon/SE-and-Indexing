<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for making at least one metal strip (2) of small width from a molten material kept at a temperature above its melting temperature and contained in a metallurgical vessel (3). The process consists in subjecting the molten material (4) to a pressure which is at least equal to atmospheric pressure, in ejecting the said molten material through at least one orifice (13) of elongate form and made in the lower part (10a) of a nozzle (10) integral with the said metallurgical vessel (3), in solidifying the said molten material (4) in at least one groove (22) made on a cooling surface (20) arranged opposite the said orifice (13) and in line with the latter and, simultaneously, in displacing the said cooling surface (20) in the longitudinal direction of the groove (22). A further subject of the invention is a device for implementing this process as well as a metal strip obtained by this process.

Process for producing at least one narrow metal
strip (2) from a molten material (4) maintained at a

temperature above its melting temperature and contained
in a metallurgical container (3), in which process the

molten material (4) is injected through a nozzle (10)
integrally formed with said metallurgical container (3)

and the molten material (4) is solidified on a movable
cooling surface (20) located below said nozzle (10),

characterised in that:

the molten material (4) is subjected to a pressure
at least equal to atmospheric pressure,
said molten material (4) is injected through at
least one elongated orifice (13) provided in the lower

part (10a) of said nozzle,
said molten material is solidified in at least one
channel (22) formed on said cooling surface (20) and

arranged opposite said orifice (13) and aligned
therewith,
and at the same time said cooling surface (20) is
moved in the longitudinal direction of said channel

(22).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the linear speed of displacement of the cooling surface

(20) is between 10 and 60 m/s, preferably between 30 and
45 m/s.
Apparatus for producing at least one narrow metal
strip (2) for carrying out the process according to one

of claims 1 and 2, comprising:

a metallurgical container (3) containing a molten
material (4) kept at a temperature above its melting

temperature and comprising in its lower part (3b) at
least one nozzle (10) communicating with the latter and

provided at one end, known as the lower end (10a), with 
at least one orifice (13) for the ejection of the molten

material (4),
at least one movable cooling surface (20) located
below the nozzle (10) opposite said orifice and adapted

to receive the molten material (4) and cause it to
solidify,

characterised in that the metallurgical container (3)
containing the molten material (4) is at a pressure at

least equal to atmospheric pressure and in that said
orifice (13) is elongated in the direction of movement

of the cooling surface (20) and is contained in a
substantially horizontal plane, said cooling surface

(20) being provided with at least one channel (22)
arranged opposite said orifice (13) and aligned

therewith.

that the width of said channel (22) in its top part

(22a) is greater than the maximum width of said orifice
(13).
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in
that the width of said channel (22) in its top part

(22a) is between 1.5 and 5 times the maximum width of
said orifice (13).
