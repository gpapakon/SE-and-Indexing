<ABSTRACT>
An immunoassay for an antibody comprises: 

(i) contacting a solid phase, on which is 
immobilised a first recombinant peptide which presents an 

antigenic sequence to which the antibody is capable of 
binding, with a test sample; 
(ii) contacting the solid phase with a second 
recombinant peptide which presents the said antigenic 

sequence, which is labelled and which was expressed in an 
organism of a different genus than that in which the first 

recombinant peptide was expressed; and 
(iii) determining whether the test sample contained 
any said antibody. 
A suitable protein for use in assaying for anti-p24 
and anti-gp41 HIV-1 antibody is a fusion of a gag sequence 

comprising amino acids 121-356 and an env sequence 
comprising amino acids 542-674. The amino acids are 

numbered according to Meusing 
et
al
, Nature, 
313
, 450-458 
(1985).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to immunoassays for antibodies, to a 
protein and to test kits for use in such immunoassays. It further relates 
to a pharmaceutical composition containing the protein. The most common expression systems for cloning 
antigens are those in which the antigens are expressed in 
E. Coli However, E. Coli occurs noticeably as part of the 
gut flora. Many human sera therefore contain antibodies to 
E. Coli. When antigens produced in E. Coli are used in 
sandwich immunoassays for antibody, there is the possibility 
that some individuals may react with contaminating bacterial 
Material. Such a reaction may give a false positive result 
for that particular individual. This type of false positive 
may be minimised by mixing material from E. Coli with a test 
sample. We have now devised a new way of overcoming the 
problem of contaminating material. In essence, 
immunologically identical antigens are engineered into 
different organisms. Cloned antigen from different 
organisms is therefore provided on either side of the 
"sandwich". Antibody it is not wished to detect in a test 
sample may bind to contaminating material associated with 
one of the cloned antigens but, because they are from 
different sources, not to contaminants associated with both 
cloned antigens. False positives can thus be avoided. 
Importantly, it is not then necessary to ensure that the 
cloned antigens are absolutely free of contaminating  
 
proteins. The specificity of the assay is greatly improved. 
The preparation of the antigens is simplified. Accordingly, the present invention provides an 
immunoassay for an antibody, which immunoassay comprises: 
(i) contacting a solid phase, on which is 
immobilised a first recombinant peptide which presents an 
antigenic sequence to which the antibody is capable of 
binding, with a test sample; (ii) contacting the solid phase with a second 
recombinant peptide which presents the said antigenic 
sequence, which is labelled and which was expressed in an 
organism of a different genus than that in which the first 
recombinant peptide was expressed; and (iii) determining whether the test sample contained 
any said antibody. Any antibody may be assayed for in this way. The 
recombinant peptides must both include the same antibody 
binding site. Detection depends on the fact that antibodies 
have at least two antigen combining sites, two for IgG, IgA 
and IgE and five for IgM. Taking IgG as an example, one of 
the antigen combining sites binds with the first recombinant 
peptide
