<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a steam oven comprising a steam vent which is triggered automatically and/or manually by control means before cooking is finished. The steam vent according to the invention is constituted essentially by an opening (7) made on one of the walls (30) of the cavity (3), and by a valve (8) connected mechanically to the cavity by holding means (11, 12, 13). The control means control the device in such a manner that the valve (8) closes the opening (7) when the vent is in rest position and moves away from this opening when the vent is triggered, allowing the steam confined in the cavity (3) to escape gradually to the outside of the cavity.
