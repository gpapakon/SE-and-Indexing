<ABSTRACT>
An objective of the present device is to maintain a flag, when hoisted, 
irrespective of whether wind is blowing or not as well as to improve the 

appearance of the flag when hoisted. 
To achieve the objective, compressed air is transmitted from a compressor 
to exhaust holes positioned next to the flag. Alternatively, propellers 

mounted adjacent to the flag and driven by a battery or electric motor 
provide the necessary air currents to keep the flag flying in the absence 

of wind.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present device relates to flag hoisting apparatus, 
and more particularly relates to flag hoisting apparatus 
used to hoist a flat at a tip of a rod-like member. A flag is generally made of cloth or paper and is 
hoisted at a tip of a rod-like member generally called 
pole, and sometimes the flag may have such a function  
 
as decoration, signal, sign, symbol, or others. For instance, as a sign to display a nation, there 
exist, in addition to a national flag, an emperor flag, a 
king flag, a sovereign flag, a government flag, a 
standard, and a naval ensign or a merchant ship flag for 
marine use. Particular name is assigned to each section of the 
national flag as described above, and a side of a 
national flag closer to a pole is called hoist, while a 
side opposite to the hoist is called fly, and a flag with 
a fly having a form of swallow tail is called tailor flag. Most of national flags as described above are 
rectangular, and the aspect ratio is generally 2:3 or 1:2. In hoisting apparatus for a conventional type of 
flag, a pulley is provided at a tip of a rod-like member, 
a string is set over the pulley, upper and lower sections 
of the flag are connected to the string, and the flag is 
pulled up to the tip of the rod-like member by pulling 
down the string. When a flag is hoisted, however, if there is no wind 
blowing, the other side of the flag hangs down loosely. As a result, a mark shown on the flag is not shown 
clearly, and the appearance is rather poor, and in 
addition the flag can not be used conveniently. To solve the problems as described above, the present 
device provides flag hoisting apparatus used to hoist a  
 
flag at a tip of a rod-lie member, having air sending 
means for sending air so that the flag hoisted at the tip 
of the rod-like member is maintained in good conditions. Also the present device provides flag hoisting 
apparatus used to hoist a flag at a tip of a rod-like 
member, having an exhaust section to exhaust compressed 
air so that the flag is hoisted in good conditions and a 
compressor communicated to the exhaust section to send 
compressed air. Furthermore the present device provides flag hoisting 
apparatus used to hoist a flat at a tip of a rod-like 
member, having a propeller mechanism for sending air so 
that the flag hosted at the tip of the rod-like member is 
maintained in good conditions and a drive section 
connected to the propeller mechanism for driving the 
propeller mechanism. With the device as described above, when a flag is 
hosted at a
