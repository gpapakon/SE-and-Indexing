<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce the glued joint between the insulator (12) and the metal fitting (18), the glueing gap (22) is partially filled with a rapid-curing first glue compound (26). After this, the glueing gap (22) is completely filled with a slowly bonding, second glue compound (36). In consequence, the tool usage time is shortened and a fine-quality glued joint is achieved.

Method of producing a cement joint (16) between an 
insulator (12), in particular a porcelain insulator, and 

an armature (18), in particular a metal armature, in 
which the cement gap (22) which is open towards the top 

between the insulator (12) and the armature (18) is 
filled with a cement compound (26, 36) and the latter is 

hardened, characterized in that the cement gap (22) is 
partially filled with a quick-hardening first cement 

compound (26) and the cement gap (22) is then filled up 
with a slowly bonding second cement compound (36). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the second cement compound (36) is introduced after 

at least partial hardening of the first cement compound 
(26). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cement gap (22) is filled with the first cement 

compound (26) to a layer thickness (30) of 10 % to 20 % 
of its overall length (32). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that sulphur cement is used as the first cement 

compound (26). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that Portland cement is used as the second 

cement compound (36). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that a synthetic resin concrete with epoxy 

resin and silica sand is used as the second cement compound 
(36). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the cement compounds (26, 36) are  

 
poured into the cement gap (22). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the insulator (12) and the armature (18) 

are held in alignment by means of a tool (58), and the 
tool (58) is removed after partial hardening of the first 

cement compound (26). 
Insulator arrangement having an insulator (12), 
in particular a porcelain insulator, and an armature 

(18), in particular a metal armature, which are attached 
to one another by means of a cement compound (26, 36) 

which is filled into the cement gap (22) between the 
insulator (12) and the armature (18), characterized in 

that the cement gap (22), viewed in the longitudinal 
direction, has a first layer (24) of a quick-hardening 

first cement compound (26) and a second layer (34) of a 
slowly bonding second cement compound (36). 
Insulator arrangement according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that, in relation to the first layer 

(24), the second layer (34) is arranged on the side 
facing the ambient air.
