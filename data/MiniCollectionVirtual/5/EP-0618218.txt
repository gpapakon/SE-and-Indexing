<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for synthesizing an acylated derivative of a thiol which transports fatty acids, such as coenzyme A. According to this process, a silylated or stannylated thiol is prepared by reacting the thiol with a silylating or stannylating reagent to replace the labile hydrogens of the thiol at least partially by SiR3 or SnR3 groups, R being an alkyl or aryl group. The silylated or stannylated thiol is then reacted in an anhydrous organic medium with an activated organic acid and a deprotecting reagent capable of removing the silyl or stannyl groups. Acylated coenzyme A derivatives in which the acyl group can have up to 30 carbon atoms may thus be obtained in high yields.
