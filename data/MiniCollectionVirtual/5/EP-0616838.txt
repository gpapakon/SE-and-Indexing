<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing a lumen filler and/or unwanted process aids from hollow fibres or hollow fibre membranes, characterised in that the hollow fibres or hollow fibre membranes are extracted with supercritical gases. The invention likewise relates to the hollow fibres or hollow fibre membranes freed by this process from a lumen filler and/or unwanted process aids.

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing a lumen filler and/or unwanted process
auxiliaries from hollow-fibre membranes for use in the field

of medicine, which are made of polymers and contain pore
stabilisers and/or hydrophilizing agents, characterised in

that the hollow-fibre membranes are extracted with
supercritical gases, whereby supercritical gases are selected

which do not chemically alter the membrane polymer or remove
pore stabilisers and/or hydrophilizing agents.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that
supercritical gases CO

, n-butane, propane, ethylene, toluene or mixtures of the
same are used.
A process in accordance with Claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that liquids or solvents are added to the supercritical gas.
A process in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that
the liquid or solvent added is methanol or water.
A process in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the supercritical gas is left to act on

the hollow fibres or hollow-fibre membranes for 1 to 600
minutes and preferably for 20 to 240 minutes.
A process in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that extraction is carried out on the

hollow-fibre bundle. 
A process in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that when CO
2
 is used, the pressure is at
least 73 bar and preferably at least 100 bar, and the

temperature is at least 31°C and preferably at least 40°C.
A process in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the removed lumen filler and/or the

removed process auxiliaries are collected and used again in a
new application.
Hollow fibre or hollow fibre membrane in which the lumen
filler has been removed in accordance with the process

described in Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the hollow
fibre or hollow fibre membrane has a residual content of less

than 500 ppm of isopropyl myristate.
Hollow fibre or hollow-fibre membrane in accordance with
Claim 8, characterised in that the residual content is less

than 300 ppm of isopropyl myristate.
