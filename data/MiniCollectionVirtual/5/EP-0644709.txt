<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a device for starting and operating a gas discharge lamp in motor vehicles. The device according to the invention has a switched-mode regulator (on-off controller, switching regulator) and a regulator for regulating the output power of the switched-mode regulator. A limiter limits the maximum current in the primary circuit of the switched-mode regulator. In the starting phase of the lamp, a control device specifies an increased desired value for the regulator and at the same time drives the limiter in such a way that during the starting phase the limiter permits an increased maximum primary current. In the stationary burning phase (operating phase) of the discharge lamp the control device has the effect that both the desired power value and the maximum primary current strength permitted by the limiter are lowered to a lower value. An overloading of the switched-mode regulator is thereby effectively prevented when the voltage on the vehicle electic system drops.

A device for starting and operating a gas discharge lamp (1) in motor vehicles, having a
primary-clocked switching controller (2) for supplying a lamp triggering device (3) for

the gas discharge lamp (1), having a device (4) for detecting the output of the switching
controller (2), having a controller (5), which based on the output of the switching

controller (2) generates a control signal (R) for influencing the primary current (I) of the

switching controller (2), having a limiter (6) for limiting the control signal (R), and
having a control device (7) which predetermines a power setting value for the controller

(5) depending on the operating conditions of the gas discharge lamp (1), characterised in
that the control device (7) also controls the limiter (6) for the control signal (R), in fact

depending on the operating conditions of the gas discharge lamp (1).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the primary-clocked switching
controller (2) is constructed as a pulse-width modulated blocking oscillator.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the lamp triggering device (3)
comprises a current inverter and a starter device.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the controller (5) forms the control
signal (R) depending on the difference of the power setting value (P
set
) and the power
feedback value (P
feed
) and on the duration of the existence of the difference between the
power setting value (P
set
) and the power feedback value (P
feed
).
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the controller (5) is an integral
control unit or comprises an integral control unit. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the control device (7) is a lamp
starting controller and that the operating time of the gas discharge lamp is provided as

the determining operating condition.
A device according to claims 1 or 6, characterised in that within a predetermined time
interval after the switching-on of the gas discharge lamp (I) the control device (7)

predetermines a power setting value (P
set
) for the controller (5) which is increased
compared with the steady-state rated value and reduces this value to the steady-state

rated value after the elapse of the predetermined time interval.
A device according to claims I or 6, characterised in that within a predetermined time
interval after the switching-on of the gas discharge lamp (1) the control device (7)

predetermines a maximum value for the limited control signal (R') for the limiter (6)
which is increased compared with the steady-state rated value and reduces this increased

value to the steady-state rated value after the elapse of the predetermined time interval.
A device according to claims 7 or 8, characterised in that during the predetermined time
interval the control device (7) triggers the controller (5) and the limiter (6) with

increased allowed values which are approximately twice as high as the steady-state rated
values.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that at least the controller (5), the limiter
(6) and the control device (7) are constructed as a microcomputer circuit.
