<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxially 
oriented film of polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate. 
More specifically, it 
relates to a biaxially oriented film of polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate 
which has high strength in 
the longitudinal direction and which is excellent in 
flatness and is useful as a base film for magnetic 
recording media such as a video tape, an audio tape and 
a computer data cartridge which are capable of 
recording for a long time. In recent years, magnetic tapes such as a 
video tape, an audio tape and a computer data cartridge 
are increasingly required to perform high-density 
recording for downsizing and high-quality display 
images, and further, it is also required to decrease 
the thickness and increase the recordable hours of the 
magnetic tapes. For complying with the requirement of 
an increase in the recordable hours of a magnetic tape, 
it is necessary to decrease the thickness of the base 
film. The decrease in the thickness may sometimes 
cause a decrease the stiffness of a tape so that the 
tape edge is liable to be damaged when the tape is 
loaded or unloaded, or that a tape undergoes 
deformation and recorded data is liable to have a 
strain when high tensile force is instantaneously 
exerted on the tape. For these reasons, the base film 
for a magnetic tape having long recordable hours is 
required to have a high Young's modulus. Further, VTRs equipped with cameras are 
recently widely used, and these machines are used 
outdoors or in automobiles. As a result, the magnetic 
tape is often exposed to severer temperature conditions 
than it was heretofore used, and there are therefore 
increasing demands for the dimensional stability of the  
 
tape at high temperatures and hence, strong demands for 
the dimensional stability of its base film at high 
temperatures. A biaxially oriented polyethylene 
terephthalate film has been conventionally used as a 
base film for the above magnetic recording tape, and in 
particular, there is known a so-called supertensilized 
film of which the Young's modulus in the longitudinal 
direction is increased for long recordable hours. In 
this film, however, the maximum Young's modulus in the 
longitudinal direction is 850 kg/mm2 at most, and the 
maximum Young's modulus in the transverse direction is 
450 kg/mm2 at most. Further, an attempt to increase 
the Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction 
inevitably decreases the Young's modulus in the 
transverse direction, and the tape is liable to suffer 
damage
