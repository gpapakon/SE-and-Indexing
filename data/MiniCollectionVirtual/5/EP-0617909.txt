<ABSTRACT>
This appliance comprises a base (1) in the form of an open-bottomed frame, a removable tray (2) designed to rest on said base, a grid (3) placed on top of the tray (2), for the cooking of the food, and an electrical heating element (4) situated underneath the grid (3) and comprising a handle (6) adapted to rest in a seat (8) on the base (1). According to the invention, the handle (6) has a switch (9) for controlling the electrical power supply to the element (4), the closing of which is subordinate on the one hand to the handle's (6) being positioned correctly in the seat (8), and on the other to the actuating of a transmitter (10) mounted on said base (1) and designed to detect the presence of the tray (2) in the base (1). The invention applies to appliances such as grills for domestic use.

Electric cooking appliance comprising a base (1) in the form
of a frame with an open bottom, a removable tank (2) designed to

rest on the said base, a grille (3) for cooking foodstuffs placed
above the tank (2), and an electric heating element (4) disposed

beneath the grille (3) by means of a support (5) and comprising
a handle (6) adapted to rest in a housing (8) in the base (1),

characterised in that the handle (6) has a switch (9) controlling
the supply of electricity to the element (4), the closure of

which is subject, on the one hand, to the correct positioning of
the handle (6) in the housing (8) and, on the other hand, to the

activation of a transmitter (10) fixed to the said base and
adapted to detect the presence of the tank (2) in the base (1).
Electric cooking appliance according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the transmitter (10) is a device movably
mounted in the base (1), one end of which (11) is designed to

come into contact with the tank (2) and the other end of which
(12) is designed to control the switch (9).
Electric cooking appliance according to Claim 2,

characterised in that the movable device (10) is pivotally
mounted about a shaft (13) fixed to the base (1).
Electric cooking appliance according to Claim 2,

characterised in that the movable device (10) is slidably mounted
in a guide fixed to the base (1).
Electric cooking appliance according to any one of Claims 2
to 4,
 
characterised in that the base (1) is in the form of a frame with

an open bottom, a section of which has a housing (8) which
includes the transmitter (10), while the handle (6) has a shape

complementary to that of the housing and has an opening (16)
designed to permit the passage of the end (12) of the movable

device (10) in order to actuate the switch (9) mounted in the
handle (6).
Electric cooking appliance according to any one of the
preceding claims,

characterised in that the handle (6) has a temperature detector
(17) which is influenced by a movable sensor (18) fixed to the

base (1) and adapted to come into contact with the tank (2) when
it is mounted in the base (1).
Electric cooking appliance according to Claim 6,

characterised in that the sensor (18) is associated with a
movable transmitter (19) for detection of the presence of the

tank (2).
Electric cooking appliance according to Claim 7,

characterised in that the transmitter (19) is produced from a
metal piece and has a forked end, one arm (20) of which is

designed to control a switch (9-21) and the other arm (22) of
which is designed to make contact with the detector (17).
Electric cooking appliance according to Claim 7,

characterised in that the transmitter (19) is produced from a
moulded heat-resistant plastic and the sensor is formed by a

metal track (23) which conducts heat and is designed to transmit
the temperature from the tank to the detector (17).
