<ABSTRACT>
A cylindrical cutting element for a coal cutting machine has a screw-shaped or helical reamer-loader which projects from the surface of the cutting element (10) and is composed of base parts arranged at a uniform distance from each other. A chisel-holder (30) with an exchangeable chisel (40) is linked to each base part (20). The chisel-holder (30) is inserted with a plug-in lengthening piece (31) into a socket (21) of the base part and is held therein by a pressure screw (50). In order to shorten the mounting time of a cutting element (10), so that the base parts (20) may be easily positioned and secured on the surface of the cutting element (10), regularly spaced pockets (27) are provided at the surface of the cutting element along the screw-shaped or helical reamer-loader to be built. The base parts (20) run out at their lower sides in a foot (26) whose cross-section is adapted to the pockets (27). The base parts (20) are positioned and inserted with their foot (26) into a pocket (27) and secured thereto.

Cylindrical cutter (10) for a coal cutting
machine having a cutting-and-loading screw or cutting

helix which is disposed on the surface of the cutter in
a protruding manner and is formed from base members (20)

situated with uniform spacings therebetween, wherein a
bit holder (30), having an interchangeable bit (40), is

connected to each base member, wherein the bit holder is
introduced into a recess (21) of the base member with an

extension (31) and retained therein by means of a
pressing screw (50), characterised in that pocket-like

recesses (27) are provided with uniform spacings
therebetween in the surface of the cutter along the

cutting-and-loading screw or cutting helix to be formed,
in that the base members (20) extend as a foot (26) at

their undersides, which foot has a cross-section adapted
to that of the pocket-like recesses (27), and in that

the base members (20) are introduced into a pocket-like
recess (27) so, as to be positioned by the foot (26) and

are securedly connected to said recess.
Cutter according to claim 1, characterised in
that the base members (20) are supported with the

undersides of their feet (26) on supporting faces of the
pocket-like recesses (27). 
Cutter according to claim 1, characterised in
that the base members (20) are insertable in the

pocket-like recesses (27) as far as the stop member on
the surface of the cutter (10).
Cutter according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the pocket-like recesses (27) are

rearwardly open when viewed with respect to the
direction of travel, and in that the base members (20)

are insertable in the direction of travel of the cutter
as far as the stop member on the front sides of the

pocket-like recesses (27), when viewed with respect to
the direction of travel.
Cutter according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that, after being insertion in the

pocket-like recesses (27), the feet (26) of the base
members (20) are welded and/or screw-connected to the

surface of the cutter.
Cutter according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the base members (20) are arranged

in rows adjacent one another in the cutting-and-loading
screw or cutting helix.
Cutter according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the pressing screw is configured

as threaded bolt (50) with a terminally situated tool
holder (52).
Cutter according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the base members (20) and the bit

holders (30) are forged and heat-treated.
