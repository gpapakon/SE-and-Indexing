<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid crystal display device comprising an array of image points. It includes an assembly of at least one first and one second display element (1) the said assembly being produced with overlapping between the ends (2, 4) of the elements (1) in such a way as to maintain a constant pitch between the image points (10).

Liquid crystal display device having a network of image 
pixels (10) comprising an assembly of at least one first and 

one second display elements (1) each comprising a first face 
and a second face opposite to the first face, characterised 

in that the said assembly is produced by overlapping the ends 
(2, 4) of the elements (1) in such a way as to maintain a 

constant distance between the image pixels (10), the said 
elements (1) having a first end (2) for electrical connection 

comprising electrical contacts (3) disposed on the first face 
(12) of the said elements (1) and a second end (4) opposite 

to the first end (2), and in that the overlapping is produced 
between the second end (4) of the first face (12) of the 

first element (1) and the first end (2) of the second face 
(14) of the second element (1). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
first face (12) of the device comprises a stepped region 

(12') which extends it and which comprises the said 
electrical contacts (3). 
Display device according to any of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that each element (1) comprises two glass 

plates (16, 18) with a seal (17) between them, between which 
plates a liquid crystal element (19) is enclosed. 
Display device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that each element (1) comprises an 

elementary matrix of image pixels (20). 
Display device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the first ends (2) of at least some of 

the elements (1) are disposed in abutment on a corresponding 
lateral face (11) of a casing (20).  

 
Display device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the elements (1) are parallel to each 

other. 
Display device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it comprises a matrix of elements (1) 

in two dimensions, in which the elements (1) are overlapping 
in one dimension and are disposed edge to edge in the other 

dimension. 
Display device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the display elements (1) are mounted in 

casings assembled together in a frame (30) in such a way as 
to present a group (J) in the overlapping direction to permit 

detachment of a single casing by releasing the two casings 
which are adjacent in the said direction.
