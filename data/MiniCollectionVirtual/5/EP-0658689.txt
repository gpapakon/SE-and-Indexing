<ABSTRACT>
A shaft engine including a piston (10) moved in a 
cylinder (40) to reciprocate at least one cylinder shaft (20,200) 

causing it to turn a crankshaft, the at least one 
cylinder shaft having a respective longitudinal air 

passage (20,24) linked to either raised air chamber (44,45,46,47) on the 
cylinder (40) through a respective extension tube (440,450) on either 

raised air chamber for sending exhaust gas out of the cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shaft 
engine having cylinder shafts reciprocated by the piston 
thereof to move a crank shaft for power output, wherein 
the cylinder shafts comprise air passages for guiding a 
fuel gas into the cylinder and for sending exhaust gas 
out of the cylinder respectively. The engine of a motor vehicle is generally 
comprised of a cylinder having a piston or pistons 
reciprocated, by means of the burning of a fuel gas in 
the cylinder, to turn a crank shaft. This structure 
of engine further comprises an exhaust piping system, 
intake and exhaust valves, and an exhaust cam. 
Therefore, this structure of engine is complicated and 
difficult to maintain. Because of a complicated 
structure, the manufacturing cost and weight of this 
engine are relatively increased. Further, in a two 
stroke engine, the exhaust and intake strokes are 
simultaneously performed when the piston is moved to the 
lower limit, and therefore the problem of low combustion 
efficiency and high exhaust emissions cannot be 
eliminated.  The present invention eliminates the 
aforesaid drawbacks. It is one object of the present 
invention to provide a shaft engine which is simple in 
structure, lightweight, and inexpensive to manufacture. 
It is another object of the present invention to provide 
a shaft engine which is easy to maintain, and durable in 
use. It is still another object of the present 
invention to provide a shaft engine which is efficient 
in operation. It is still another object of the 
present invention to provide a shaft engine which 
greatly saves the consumption of fuel gas. It is still 
another object of the present invention to provide a 
shaft engine which greatly reduces exhaust emissions. According to one embodiment of the present 
invention, the shaft engine comprises a piston moved in 
a cylinder to reciprocate a plurality of cylinder shafts 
causing them to turn a crank shaft, wherein the cylinder 
shafts have a respective longitudinal air passage linked 
to either raised air chamber on the cylinder through a 
respective extension tube on either raised air chamber 
for sending exhaust gas out of the cylinder and guiding 
a fuel gas into the cylinder respectively. 
Fig. 1 is an assembly view in section of a  
 
shaft engine according to a first embodiment of the 
present invention; Fig. 2 is a cross section taken along line A-A 
of Figure 1; Fig. 3 is a cross section taken along line C-C 
of Figure 2; Fig. 4 shows an alternate form of the piston 
of the shaft engine of Figure 1;

<CLAIMS>
A shaft engine comprising a cylinder 
having at least one spark plug and at least one raised 

air chamber, each raised air chamber having an extension 
tube perpendicularly extended outwards from said 

cylinder, a piston alternatively moved up and down in 
said cylinder by burning a fuel gas being guided into 

said cylinder by means of the ignition of said spark 
plug, at least one cylinder shaft respectively received 

in said at least one raised air chamber and the extension 
tube of either raised air chamber and reciprocated by 

piston to move a crank shaft outside said cylinder, each 
cylinder shaft being peripherally mounted with seal 

rings to seal the gap between either extension tube and 
having a longitudinal air passage moved to communicate 

with either raised air chamber for sending exhaust gas 
from said cylinder to the outside. 
The shaft engine of claim 1 wherein said 
cylinder comprises a fuel gas intake pipe in the middle 

at one lateral side; said at least one cylinder shaft 
includes two first cylinder shafts linked for sending 

out exhaust gas and two second cylinder shafts for 
cooling and lubrication, each first cylinder shaft 

comprising a first radial air hole near a top end 
thereof and a second radial air hole in the middle 

thereof; each extension tube has two radial through 
 

holes at different elevations respectively communicated 
with either raised air chamber, the radial through holes 

on either extension tube being closed upon the down 

stroke of said first cylinder shafts or opened upon the 
up stroke. 
The shaft engine of claim 2 wherein said 
second cylinder shafts include one having an upper 

longitudinal oil passage at the top linked to an inside 
space of said piston through a radial through hole 

thereof, and a second having a lower longitudinal oil 
passage at the bottom linked to said inside space of 

said piston through a radial through hole thereof. 
The shaft engine of claim 2 wherein said 
piston is comprised of two symmetrical parts spaced at 

different elevations by an oil space; said second 
cylinder shafts include one having an upper longitudinal 

oil passage at the top linked to the oil space between 
the two symmetrical parts of said piston through a 

radial through hole thereof, and a second having a lower 
longitudinal oil passage at the bottom linked to the oil 

space between the two symmetrical parts of said piston 
through a radial through hole thereof. 
The shaft engine of claim 2 said first 
 

cylinder shafts include one having a longitudinal air 
passage for guiding a fuel gas into said cylinder, and 

the other having a longitudinal air passage for sending 
exhaust gas out of said cylinder. 
The shaft engine of claim 1 wherein said 
at least one cylinder shaft includes two cylinder 

shafts, one cylinder shaft having a longitudinal air 
passage for guiding a fuel gas into said cylinder, and 

the other cylinder having a longitudinal air passage for
