<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the thickness of ferromagnetic 
material deposited on a nuclear fuel rod. 

Calibration samples of known thickness and known 
permeability are placed between the probe of an eddy 

current sensor and a conductive surface. A plurality 
of calibration points are plotted to provide a 

characteristic complex impedance diagram for a probe 
excited at a predetermined frequency. Then the complex 

impedance of the probe excited at the selected frequency 
is measured when in proximity to a fuel rod having a 

corrosion layer of unknown thickness and unknown magnetic 
permeability. For each probe position, the two 

components of the complex impedance, i.e., the inductive 
reactance and the resistance, are determined and plotted 

on the characteristic complex impedance diagram. The 
position of the measured data point relative to the 

calibration points enables one to determine the lift-off 
error due to the presence of ferromagnetic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to electromagnetic 
test methods for evaluating the integrity and corrosion 
resistance of nuclear fuel rod cladding. In particular, 
the invention relates to techniques for improving the 
accuracy of the results of such electromagnetic test 
methods. Electromagnetic test methods are commonly used in 
evaluation of the integrity of nuclear fuel rod cladding 
and in the evaluation of the relative performance, such 
as resistance to corrosion, of cladding materials which 
are subjected to the reactor core operating environment. 
In particular, electromagnetic test methods are used to 
measure the thickness of a layer of corrosion formed on 
the outer circumferential surface of the fuel rod cladding. The conventional test for measuring corrosion 
thickness on a fuel rod uses an eddy current sensor, the 
probe of which is placed in proximity to the fuel rod 
cladding, separated only by a layer of corrosion. The 
probe is coupled to an instrument for displaying the 
inductive reactance of the probe when in proximity to 
the fuel rod. The probe of a typical eddy current 
sensor has a coil of conductive wire which in effect 
acts as both a transmitter and a receiver of magnetic 
flux. When the coil is driven with an alternating 
current, an alternating magnetic flux emanates from the  
 
coil. This alternating magnetic flux induces alternating 
eddy currents in the conductive fuel rod cladding, 
which is typically made of Zircaloy. These 
alternating eddy currents in turn produce an alternating 
magnetic flux which induces an alternating "bucking" 
current which opposes the alternating drive current 
through the probe coil. The instrument coupled to the 
probe is used to measure the resulting decrease in the 
current flowing through the probe, which decrease is a 
measure of the inductive reactance of the probe. The inductive reactance is a function of the distance 
separating the probe coil from the conductive 
sample in which the eddy currents are induced. Thus, 
the inductive reactance of the probe, when in contact 
with a layer of corrosion at a particular point along 
the fuel rod cladding, is a measure of corrosion thickness 
at that point. This separation distance between 
the cladding and the probe is commonly referred to as 
the "lift-off". During normal operation of reactors, it is quite 
common for the reactor coolant to transport dissolved 
particles which leach out from the reactor circulation 
piping and which tend to deposit on the nuclear fuel 
rods in the form
