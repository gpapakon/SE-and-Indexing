<ABSTRACT>
A W-Cu-Ni alloy having thermophysical properties suitable
for use in electrical contacts and electrodes is described.

The alloy is formed by direct sintering of a powder blend
comprising a tungsten-copper composite powder and a nickel

powder. The tungsten-copper composite powder component of the
blend comprises individual dual phase particles having a

copper phase and a tungsten phase wherein the tungsten phase
substantially encapsulates the copper phase. The method for

direct sintering the W-Cu-Ni alloy substantially eliminates
the formation of brittle intermetallics and slumping during

sintering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to materials for electrical contacts
and electrodes. In particular, this invention relates to
tungsten-copper composites.Alloys for electrical contacts and electrodes are
metallurgical composites based on heterogeneous systems
(pseudoalloys) of two or more components with vastly different
thermophysical properties. The properties of these alloys
represent optimal combinations of the component
characteristics and are required for operation in applications
such as high-current interrupters with gas or oil as arc
quenching media, electrical discharge machining, spot welding,
and other applications employing an electrical discharge.
Common to these applications is the electrical arcing which
occurs between the contacts or between an electrode and a
workpiece. For example, electrical contacts serve as points of 
arc attachment at current switching. Despite the momentary
duration of switching, electric arcs in oil- or gas-filled
high-current interrupters fully develop into high temperature
plasma discharges. At the points of arc attachment, plasma
discharges generate electrodynamic forces and thermal fluxes
causing erosive wear of electrical contacts. Material erosion
reaches its peak in electrical contacts operating in an
oxidizing environment (e.g., air-blast high-current
interrupters). To withstand this wear, electrical contact
materials must possess specific thermophysical properties.Tungsten-copper composites are preferred materials for these
applications. However, electrical contacts made from unalloyed
W-Cu composites are prone to cracking in electrical discharge
environments. The problem appears to stem from the poor
thermal shock resistance of the composite. When the structural
continuity is partially or totally disrupted by the loss of
copper due to arc heating, the composite loses the ability to
undergo plastic deformation as a single structure. If
excessive thermal fluxes produced by the arc attachment to the
contact are not dissipated quickly, the thermal shock
generates high thermal stresses and cracks in the contact. For
composites with an average tungsten grain size of about 20 µm,
cracking occurs after a period of more or less even ablation.
Tungsten-copper composites with an average tungsten grain size
of about 5 µm show greater cracking, apparently resulting from
further sintering of the tungsten which causes significant
shrinkage and pore formation. The erosion rate and cracking
can increase considerably if the pore volume in the composite
material exceeds
