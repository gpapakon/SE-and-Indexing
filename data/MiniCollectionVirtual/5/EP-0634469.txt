<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound having an
unsaturated side chain, a process for preparing the same, a liquid
crystalline polymer prepared from the same, a liquid crystal mixture
and a display element.In these days, as a liquid crystal display, twisted
nematic (TN) liquid crystal displays are most widely used. A TN liquid
crystal display has various advantages such as low driving voltage, a
low power demand, and the like. However, its response speed is
slower than a light-emitting type display element such as a cathode
ray tube display, an electroluminescence display, a plasma display,
etc.A super twisted nematic (STN) liquid crystal display
having an increased twist angle from 180°C to 270°C has been developed,
but its response speed is still insufficient.Though various improvements have been made in the
liquid crystal displays, no TN liquid crystal display having a high
response speed has been developed.In a new display using ferroelectric liquid crystals
which is recently vigorously studied, a response speed may be
expected to be increasesd greatly (see Clark et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., 
36, 899 (1980)). This type of display makes use of a chiral smectic
phase such as a chiral smectic C phase (hereinafter referred to as a
"Sc* phase") which has ferroelectric properties. As phases having
ferroelectric properties, there are known chiral smectic F, G, H and
I phases in addition to the Sc* phase.The ferroelectric liquid crystal material which is
actually used in a ferroelectric liquid crystal element is required to
have various characteristics. But, at present, a single compound
cannot satisfy all the characteristics, and it is necessary to formulate
a ferroelectric liquid crystal mixture comprising plural liquid
crystal compounds, or at least one liquid crystal compound and at
least one non-liquid crystal compound.In addition to the ferroelectric liquid crystal mixture
consisting of the ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds, Japanese
Patent KOKAI Publication No. 195187/1986 discloses the preparation
of a ferroelectric liquid crystal mixture by mixing a compound having
a nonchiral smectic C, F, G, H or I phase (hereinafter referred to as
"Sc-like phase") or a mixture containing such compound with at
least one compound having the ferroelectric phase to make the liquid
crystal mixture ferroelectric as a whole.Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., 89, 327 (1982) provides a ferroelectric
liquid crystal mixture comprising a compound or a mixture
having the Sc-like phase and at least one compound which is
opticall
