<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns non-chlorinated biocides. Non-chlorinated biocides have been 
proposed and used in the past. Greenley, et al., US 5,208,057, for example, suggests a process 
for treating water used in fowl butchering processes with a bromide and an oxidant. Dry, water 
soluble chlorine containing biocides suggested by Auchincloss, US 4,822,512, have sodium 
chloride as the preferred inorganic halide, an oxidizing agent such as potassium persulphate triple 
salt, and several other required components such as sulfamic acid, a non-reducing 
organic acid, 
and an anhydrous alkali metal phosphate. In the field of bleaching agents, Clements, et al, US 4,338,210, teaches a composition 
comprising sodium bromide and a peracid precursor system, typically diphthaloyl peroxide or 
sodium perborate plus tetraacetyl ethylenediamine, and an optional scavenger system such as 
catalase. Stable, solid acetylperoxyborate compounds have been disclosed by Roesler, et al, CA 
056,503, to be useful in the fields of washing, bleaching and cleaning agent and disinfectant 
applications, and as an oxidizing agent in organic synthesis. However, the prior art does not provide a non-chlorinated biocidal composition which can 
be provided in powdered, tablet, or granular form. The present invention provides in a first aspect a biocidal composition comprising a dry, 
water soluble mixture of a solid bromide and a stable, solid peracetylperoxyborate compound 
useful as a chlorine-free water treatment system, said composition generating hypobromous acid 
upon addition of water. In another aspect the invention provides a method of treating aqueous systems to inhibit 
the growth of microorganisms therein, comprising introducing a composition as defined above in 
an amount effective to give a concentration of hypobromous acid of at least 1ppm. a further 
aspect of the invention comprises the use of a composition as defined above to inhibit the growth 
of microorganisms in aqueous systems. Suitable bromide compounds are any known species, for example, potassium, ammonium, 
or sodium bromides, or mixtures thereof. The bromide is provided in solid form. Suitable peracetylperoxyborate compounds are those disclosed in the aforementioned 
Canadian patent application of Roesler, et al. Preferred peracetylperoxyborate compounds have 
an active oxygen content of about 2 to 8% by wt., a peracetic acid content which can be liberated 
by dissolution of said peracetylperoxyborate compound in water of at least about 10% by weight, 
and a
