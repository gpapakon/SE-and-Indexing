<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a liquid manure collecting tank made of plastic, such as PVC or polyester, having a vertical plane of symmetry coincident with the vertical plane of symmetry of the slatted floor and including a bottom inclined from the front rearwards. It comprises a first front part (6) each symmetric part of which includes a dihedron consisting of a first triangular face (8), a second triangular face (12). The plane of the said first face (8) falls from the first tranverse front side (1) rearwards. A second rear part (7) of inverted pyramid shape, each symmetric part of which consists of a third quasi-triangular curved face (18) and of a fifth triangular face (23). The rear opening (16) is at the bottom of the tank and is linked to an outflow hose (17).

A recovery tray for liquid manure, made of plastic material such as PVC or polyester,
featuring a vertical plane of symmetry merging with the vertical plane of symmetry of the

grating and comprising a base inclined from front to rear, characterised in that it comprises
a first front section (6) of which each symmetrical part comprises a dihedral composed of

a first triangular face (8), of which a first side (9) is adjacent to the front horizontal side (1)
of the grating, a second side (10) is in the said plane of symmetry (II-II), and the third side

(11) is formed by the ridge of the dihedral, and a second triangular face (12) of which a first
side is formed by the ridge of the said dihedral, a second side (13) is adjacent to a part of

the lateral edge of the grating, and the third side (14) falls from the said lateral edge of the
grating to the top (15) of the first face in the said plane of symmetry, the plane of the said

first face (8) falling from the first front transverse side (1) to the rear, and a second rear part
(7), of inverted pyramidal shape, of which each symmetrical part is composed of a third

cambered and semi-triangular face (18), running from the said third side (14) of the said
second face (12) towards a rear aperture (16), of a fourth trapezoidal face (19), of which

the broad base (20) is adjacent to the rear portion of the lateral edge (3 or 4) of the grating,
the small base of which is in the said plane of symmetry which merges with the said rear

aperture (16), and the oblique sides (21, 22) of which are common, respectively, with the
third face (18) and with the fifth (23), the fifth triangular face (23) having a side (24)

adjacent to the rear transverse side (2) of the grating, and a side in the said plane of
symmetry, the said rear aperture (16) being at the base of the tray, and being connected to

a drainage pipe (17).
A recovery tray according to Claim 1, characterised in that the first triangular face (8) has
a gradient from front to rear of approximately 2 to 4 %.
A recovery tray according to Claim 1, characterised in that the third face (18) has a
greater gradient of fall from front to rear, of approximately 12 %. 
A recovery tray according to Claim 1, characterised in that the second face (12) has a fall
from the lateral edge to the centre of the tray, in the said plane of symmetry, of

approximately 11 %.
A recovery tray according to Claim 1, characterised in that the fourth face (19) has a fall
from the lateral edge to the said rear aperture of approximately 10 %.
A recovery tray according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the first
front part (6) occupies approximately 2/3 of the total length of the tray.
