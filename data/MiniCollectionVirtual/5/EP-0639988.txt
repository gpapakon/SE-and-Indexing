<ABSTRACT>
In a process of making an absorbent article (351) such as a sanitary napkin or a disposable diaper, hydrophilic fibers and crimped or coiled synthetic fibers are supplied in a single fiberboard to a defiberising means such as a hammermill (322). The process results in a homogeneous and resilient blended absorbent core that can be produced using a single defiberising unit. The crimped or coiled fibers pass through the defiberising means without their two- or three-dimensional structure being adversely affected at a relatively low defiberisation energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for making
absorbent articles comprising a liquid-pervious topsheet,
a liquid-impervious backsheet, and an absorbent
core interposed between the topsheet and the backsheet,
the absorbent core comprising a first type of fibers
that are hydrophilic and a second type of fibers that
are synthetic, the two types of fibers having been mixed
and compressed to form a fiber board, the method comprising
the step of supplying the fiber board to a defiberising
means for forming individualised fibers or groups
of fibers.The invention also relates to a fiber board for use in
such a method.A method for making an absorbent article by
defiberisation of a fiber board comprising a mix of cellulosic
fibers and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers,
is described in a brochure edited by Du Pont International
SA, 2 chemin du Pavillon, P.O. Box 50, CH-1218
Le Grand-Saconnex, Geneva. The fiber boards are
marketed by the Metsa-Serla Group, Lielahti Pulp Mill,
P.O. Box 436, SF-332101 Tampere under the registered
trade mark SPHINX "FLUFF D".In the above-given brochure it is described that
such absorbent cores have a relatively high dry and wet
net-work strength compared to sulphite and sulphate
pulps. Absorbent cores comprising PET-fibers have a
good absorption capacity and relatively high resiliency
under load, which provides for better moisture retention
and softness due to its open structure. The defiberisation
energy of fiber boards comprising cellulosic fibers
and PET-fibers is relatively low compared to the defiberisation
energy of sulfate pulp fiber boards.In US-A-5.064.484, a method of forming and bonding
a pad is disclosed, whereby e.g. wood pulp is
blended with synthetic fibres via a hammermill or other
fiberizer.US-A-4.957.795 is concerned with an elastomeric
wound dressing, comprising - inter alia - crimped fibres.
As to the method of making such dressing, a melt blowing
process is exemplified.It is an object of the invention to provide a method
of producing an absorbent article having a relatively
resilient absorbent core.It is another object of the invention to provide a
method of producing an absorbent article comprising a
core having at least two types of fibers that in the
absorbent core form a homogeneous mixture.It is another object of the invention to provide an
efficient method of producing the above mentioned
absorbent articles.In the method according to the invention, the fiber
board comprises at least 10 % by weight of synthetic fibers
that are of generally two
