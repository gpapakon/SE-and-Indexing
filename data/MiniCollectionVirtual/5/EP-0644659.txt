<ABSTRACT>
An optical disk apparatus records data on an 
optical disk or reproduces data therefrom. The optical 

disk has a plurality of zones each including a plurality 
of tracks, and the optical disk apparatus records or 

reproduces data with respect to the zones on the basis 
of clock signals having different frequencies. The 

optical disk apparatus comprises first and second phase 
comparators (52, 51). The first phase comparator (52) 

is a pull-in type and outputs a signal corresponding to 
the phase difference between a clock signal generated by 

a PLL circuit (16) and a binary signal of reproduction 
data. The second phase comparator (51) is a lock-in 

type and outputs a signal corresponding to the phase 
difference between a signal obtained by frequency-dividing 

the clock signal generated by the PLL circuit 
(16) and a signal obtained by frequency-dividing a fundamental 

clock signal. When data is to be recorded or 
when the timings at which the PLL circuit (16) outputs 

clock signals are not appropriate, the clock signals 
of the PLL circuit (16) are processed by a voltage 

controlled oscillator (55) in accordance with a signal 
supplied from the pull-in type first phase comparator 

(52). When data is to be reproduced, the clock signals 
of the PLL circuit (16) are processed by the same 

voltage controlled oscillator (55) in accordance with 
a signal supplied from the lock-in type second phase 

comparator (51).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
recording/reproducing apparatus incorporated in an
optical disk apparatus or the like. The information
recording/reproducing apparatus records data on an optical
disk comprising a number of zones each having a
number of tracks, and reproduces data from the optical
disk. When data is recorded in the zones and when it is
reproduced from the zones, clock signals having different
frequencies corresponding to the respective zones
are used.An optical disk is divided into a number of zones
each having a number of tracks. In one zone, the number
of sectors provided for one track is equal to the number
of sectors provided for another track, but the number of
sectors provided for each track of one zone differs from
the number of sectors provided for each track of another
zone. When data is recorded on the optical disk or
reproduced therefrom, the optical disk is rotated at a
constant speed, and an optical head records or reproduces
the data on the basis of clock signals having
different frequencies corresponding to the respective
zones. The optical head is movable in the radial
direction of the optical disk so that data can be
recorded on a target track or reproduced therefrom.An optical disk apparatus employs two PLL (phase 
locked loop) circuits, one for generating recording
clock signals, i.e., timing clocks which are used for
data recording, and the other for generating reproducing
clock signals, i.e., timing clocks used for data identification
when the data read out from the optical disk
is reproduced. Each of the recording and reproducing
PLL circuits comprises a phase comparator, a filter, and
a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).However, if the two PLL circuits are incorporated
in a single LSI circuit, the voltage controlled oscillators
of the PLL circuits may interfere with each other,
result in the generation of noise.Prior art document EP-0409516-A3 discloses an
apparatus including a clock generating circuit according
to the preamble of present claim 1, wherein a voltage-controlled
oscillator is shared by two PLLs. The
apparatus comprises two phase comparators, control
means and a comparison circuit, and is designed for
deriving synchronisation signals from preformed marks on
a record carrier.The control means includes a comparator detecting two different amplitude values
of the signal coming from a reading head, in order to alternatively connect the
outputs of the phase comparators with the common part of the loop. The signal
inputs of the comparators
