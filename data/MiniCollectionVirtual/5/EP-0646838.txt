<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging body by 
which sheet-shaped photosensitive materials such as X-ray 
films are packaged. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a packaging body for photosensitive materials 
appropriate for handling in a bright room, and also relates to 
a collective packaging body for photosensitive materials in 
which a plurality of packaging bodies are packaged. Conventionally, photosensitive materials such as X-ray 
films are sent by a maker to a customer such as a hospital 
under the condition that a plurality of sheets of X-ray films 
are accommodated in a light-shielding moisture-proof bag and 
further this light-shielding moisture-proof bag is put in a 
packaging member to form a packaging body. When X-ray 
photographs are taken in the hospital, the packaging member is  
 
opened in a dark room and the light-shielding moisture-proof 
bag is taken out of the packaging member, and then the 
photosensitive materials are taken out of the light-shielding 
moisture-proof bag and set in an X-ray photographing 
apparatus. When the packaging body is conveyed, or when the 
photosensitive materials are set in the X-ray photographing 
apparatus, the photosensitive materials are moved in the 
light-shielding moisture-proof bag or the packaging member, so 
that they are rubbed to each other, which causes scratches on 
the surfaces of the photosensitive materials. In order to prevent the occurrence of scratches, the 
light-shielding moisture-proof bag is subjected to vacuum 
packaging so that the photosensitive materials can not be 
moved in the bag. When the vacuum packaging is conducted in 
the manner described above, the photosensitive materials are 
stuck to each other, and further the photosensitive materials 
are stuck to the light-shielding moisture-proof bag. 
Accordingly, it becomes difficult to take out the 
photosensitive materials from the light-shielding moisture-proof 
bag. In this case, after the photosensitive materials 
have been taken out from the light-shielding moisture-proof 
bag, they are subjected to fanning so that they are not stuck 
to each other, and then they are set in a film magazine. 
Since this operation is conducted in a dark room, the work 
efficiency is extremely low.  In some cases, in the process of packaging photosensitive 
materials, dust blows into the light-shielding moisture-proof 
bag and sticks onto the surfaces of the photosensitive 
materials. When the bag is subjected to vacuum packaging, 
defects and fog are caused on the
