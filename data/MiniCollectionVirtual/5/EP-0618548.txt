<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing an electronic memory card comprising:   a) a card body (12) made from a thermoplastic material and having two substantially parallel main faces; b) a support element comprising a drawing on one of its faces at least; c) an electronic module comprising a contact tag on one of the faces of which is fixed a chip incorporating an integrated circuit,  characterised by the following steps:   - in a mould, provided with an impression defining the shape of the said card and bounded by two main walls corresponding to the main faces of the said card, the said support element is laid and held against a first main wall of the mould; - a thermoplastic material is injected into the volume defined by the said impression so as to fill the said volume not occupied by the said support element; and - the said electronic module is set in place inside the impression at a suitable position of the said module before the said injected material has completely solidified.

Method of manufacturing a smart card comprising:

a) a thermoplastics material card body (12) having two
substantially parallel major sides;
b) a support member with a graphic on at least one side; and
c) an electronic module comprising a contact array to one side of
which is fixed a chip including an integrated circuit, the method

including the following steps:

said support member is placed in a mould comprising an
imprint defining the shape of said card and delimited by two main

walls corresponding to said major sides of said card and held
against a first main wall thereof; and
a thermoplastics material is injected into the volume
defined by said imprint to fill said volume not occupied by said

support member;

   is characterized in that it further includes a step in
which:


in order to cause the electronic module to penetrate into
the material before said injected material has solidified

completely said electronic module is displaced in a cavity which
opens into the second wall of the mould in such a way as to

communicate with said imprint between a first position in which it
is retracted and does not project beyond said second wall of the

mould and a second position inside the imprint in which said
electronic module is in an appropriate position in which the

contact array is flush with the second main wall of the mould.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in that said
electronic module is inserted under pressure.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims
characterized in that the respective materials of said card body

and said electronic module are such that in the liquid or viscous
state due to temperature and pressure when the electronic module

is inserted intermolecular chemical bonds are formed between the
material of the card body and the material of the electronic

module. 
Method according to claim 3 characterized in that the card
body material is acrilonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and the

electronic module material is polyamide (PA) or
polybutyleneteraphtalate (PBT).
Method according to claim 3 characterized in that the card
body material is polycarbonate (PC) and the electronic module

material is the same material or polyamide or
polybutyleneteraphtalate (PBT).
Method according to claim 3 characterized in that the
respective materials of said card body and said electronic module

comprise benzene rings and/or -C=CO groups.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims
characterized in that said electronic module is inserted in said

imprint after a time lapse from injection of the material into the
imprint less than one second and preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 s.
Device for manufacturing a smart card comprising a
thermoplastics material card body having two substantially

parallel major sides; a support member with a graphic on at least
one side; and an electronic module comprising a contact array to

one side of which is fixed a chip including an integrated circuit.
said device including:


a mould having an imprint defining the shape of the card
and delimited by two main walls corresponding to the major sides

of the card;
means for disposing and holding said support member
against a first main wall of the mould; and
means for injecting a liquid or viscous thermoplastics
material into the volume defined by said imprint to fill said

volume not occupied by said support member;

   and being characterized in that it further includes:

means for inserting and holding said electronic module by
displacing it under pressure so as to cause it to penetrate into

the injected material and into a cavity which opens into the
second main wall of the mould and which communicates with said 

imprint between a first position in which it is retracted and does
not project beyond said second wall of the mould and a second

position inside the imprint in which said electronic module is in
an appropriate position in which the contact array is flush with

the second main wall of the mould before said thermoplastic
material has solidified completely.
Device according to claim 8 characterized in that the
electronic module inserting and holding means comprise a piston on

which the electronic module is temporarily held associated with
pressurized displacement means.
Device according to claim 9 characterized in that said cavity
is on the opposite side to said means for injecting material into

said imprint.
