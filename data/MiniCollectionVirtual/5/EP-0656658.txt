<ABSTRACT>
A memory cube comprising a plurality of memory chips, each having 
a plurality of data storage devices, is provided with an auxiliary chip having 

inactive line termination circuits and the auxiliary chip or chips are formed 
as part of the memory cube structure and disposed among the memory chips 

on an interleave basis. The auxiliary circuit chips are provided with external 
terminals connected to memory input leads, control leads and data write leads, 

in close proximity to the termination point of the leads. A decoupling 

capacitor, integrated in the auxiliary circuit chip, is connected to the power bus 
in the memory cube structure and eliminates extraneous noise problems occurring 

with discrete capacitors external to the cube. A heating resistor is 
provided on the auxiliary circuit chip to maintain the cube structure at a near 

constant temperature. Temperature sensing diodes are incorporated in the 
auxiliary chip to provide an accurate mechanism for sensing the temperature 

internal to the cube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to memory devices for high performance 
computers and more specifically to high density structures constructed of a 
plurality of discrete integrated circuit chips, such as integrated circuit memory 
chips, stacked in a three dimensional fashion. High density integrated circuit memory chips are known which include 
a stack of on the order of four to forty semi- conductor memory chips. 
The memory chips are typically of a substantially square configuration and are 
joined together by an appropriate adhesive in a stacked configuration to form 
a parallelepiped structure referred to as a memory cube. Each memory chip 
typically has surface contact metalization on at least one side to- provide for 
connections to the chip. The memory chips are arranged in the cube to allow 
for interconnections along one or more of the faces of the resulting memory 
cube. The cube is typically mounted on a printed circuit substrate to provide 
for external connections to the memory, as depicted in the prior art arrangement 
shown in Figure 1. Stacked integrated circuit packaging structures have been shown to 
be particularly advantageous for high performance computers. They provide 
high packaging densities and easier access for interconnections. They are simplified 
manufacturing processes at reduced costs, while providing improved 
structural strength. The high-speed memory arrays typically consist of CMOS VLSI 
chips having large numbers of gates on each chip. A problem with densely 
packed, high-speed memory devices is the signal interference or "noise" which 
occurs when the memory is accessed to read data from or write data into the 
individual memory arrays. Particularly, every time one of the many gates of 
the chip is switched, as in response to a memory select signal, it tends to 
produce a current spike on the power bus and the cumulative effect is to cause  
 
troublesome transient spikes on the power supply bus which may affect circuit 
operation. Similarly, simultaneous switching of output drivers during memory 
read operations causes power supply transients due to the series inductance of 
the packaging structure. Furthermore, ringing or transmission line noise due 
to lack of proper terminating circuits at the memory cube causes performance 
loss for the signal transmitting driver circuits. These noise problems are generally 
understood and can be solved by providing additional noise limiting circuit 
elements such as decoupling capacitors and line termination networks. A
