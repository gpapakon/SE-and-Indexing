<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/938,427, filed
August 31, 1992.This invention relates to novel anabaseine and anabasine derivatives having
utility in treating degenerative diseases of the nervous system.It has long been customary in classifying diseases of the nervous system to
group them as degenerative, thereby indicating they are characterized by
a gradually evolving, relentlessly progressive, neuronal death. Science has
shown that a considerable portion of disorders that are classed as
degenerative are associated with genetic predisposition which results in a
pattern of dominant or recessive inheritance. However, others, although
they do not differ in a fundamental way from the hereditary disorders, may
occur only sporadically as isolated instances within a given family.As a consequence, since by definition, classification of degenerative
diseases cannot be based upon exact knowledge of their cause or
pathogenesis, subdivision of these diseases into individual syndromes rests
upon descriptive criteria based largely upon pathologic anatomy and
consideration of clinical aspects. As a result, this group of diseases
presents itself in the form of several clinical syndromes. However, apart
from the general differences that allows the distinction of one syndrome from
another, there are certain general attributes which typify this entire class of
disorders. The degenerative diseases of the nervous system can typically be divided
into disorders characterized by progressive dementia in the absence of
other prominent neurologic signs (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia,
and Pick's disease); syndromes which combine progressive dementia with
other prominent neurologic abnormalities (e.g., Huntington's disease,
Hallervorden-Spatz, and progressive familial myoclonic epilepsy); syndromes
of gradually developing abnormalities of posture and movement (e.g.,
Parkinson's disease, striatonigral degeneration, torsion dystonia, and Gilles
de la Tourette syndrome); syndromes of progressive ataxia (e.g., cerebellar
cortical degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Friedreich's ataxia);
and syndromes of muscular weakness and wasting without motor neuron
disease (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and
hereditary spastic paraplegia), to name but a few.Among those diseases listed above, perhaps those most familiar are
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These diseases are progressive
neurological disorders characteristically associated with aging.
