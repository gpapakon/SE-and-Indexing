<ABSTRACT>
A film feeding apparatus in a camera 
comprises a feeding device (4-6) for feeding film (3) from a 

film cartridge (1), a take-up spool (2) device for taking up 
the film fed by the feeding device, and a judgment 

device for judging on the basis of a variation in the 
movement speed of the film (3) whether the film has been 

taken up by the take-up spool (2). The movement speed of 
the film is determined by the feeding device (4-6) before 

the film extending from the film cartridge (1) is taken 
up by the take-up spool (2) device, and the movement 

speed of the film (3) is determined by the take-up spool 
device after the film has been taken up by the take-up 

spool device. The movement speed of the film (3) 
driven by the feeding device (4-6) differs from the 

movement speed of the film driven by the take-up 
spool device (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a film feeding 
apparatus in a camera adapted to be loaded with a 
film cartridge of the type in which the leading end 
of film is not exposed out of a feeding port. A film cartridge of the structure shown, for 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,832,275 or U.S. Patent 
No. 4,834,306 has heretofore been proposed as a film 
cartridge 502 comprising a cylindrical portion 502a 
having therein a spool shaft containing a roll of 
photographic film 501 therein, and a film feeding 
portion 502b extending integrally therewith in the 
tangential direction thereof and containing the 
leading end side of the film in a straight state. 
The construction disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
4,832,275 is schematically shown in Figure 19 of the 
accompanying drawings. According to this cartridge 
502, the spool shaft provided in the cylindrical 
portion 502a is rotatively driven in the feed 
direction of the film 501 (the direction of solid-line 
arrow in the figure) by the shaft end portion 
thereof (the spline portion indicated by 502c in the 
figure), whereby the film 501 is fed out from the  
 
leading end side thereof through a feed port in the 
end of the feeding portion 502, as indicated by dots-and-dash 
line in the figure, and the spool shaft is 
rotatively driven in the rewinding direction (the 
broken-line arrow in the figure), whereby the film 
501 is rewound and the leading end of the film can be 
wound into the feeding portion 502b. According to 
such cartridge structure, when the cartridge is to be 
loaded into a camera or when the cartridge is to be 
taken out with the film taken up after the 
termination of photographing, the leading end of the 
film 501 is in a state in which it has been drawn 
into the cartridge 502 and moreover, the feeding of 
the film 501 can be automatically accomplished by the 
spool shaft being rotatively driven by an electric 
motor or the like and therefore, the handling of the 
film 501, such as the loading of the film 501 into a 
camera, becomes easy to the operator. In this 
example, there is illustratively shown a case where 
perforations 501a are continuously formed in the 
upper and lower side edges of the film 501 as in the 
135 type film. However, there is no publication which 
discloses camera structure which can be loaded with a 
film cartridge 502 of this type and the internal 
mechanism thereof, and particularly a specific 
example of a mechanism by which the film 501 is fed  
 
out of the cartridge 502 and is wound up one frame by 
one and is

A film feeding apparatus comprising: 
   feeding means for feeding film from a film 

cartridge to a spool side; 
   detecting means for detecting that the film 

is not wound on the spool and outputting a detection 
signal; 

   rewinding means responsive to said detection 
signal to rewind the film into the film cartridge; and 

   driving means for driving said feeding means 
after the completion of the rewinding of the film by 

said rewinding means to thereby feed the film again 
from the film cartridge to the spool side. 
A film feeding apparatus in a camera 
comprising: 

   feeding means for feeding film from a film 
cartridge; 

   take-up spool means for taking up the film 
fed by said feeding means; 

   the movement speed of the film being 
determined by said feeding means before the film 

extending from the film cartridge is taken up by said 
take-up spool means, and the movement speed of the 

film being determined by said take-up spool means 
 

after the film has been taken up by said take-up spool 
means; 

   the movement speed of the film driven by 
said feeding means differing from the movement speed 

of the film driven by said take-up spool means; and 
   judgment means for judging on the basis of 

a variation in the movement speed of the film whether 
the film has been taken-up by said take-up spool 

means.

of film contained in said film cartridge is fed out of 
said cartridge by the rotation of the shaft of the 

film cartridge, comprising:

spool and taking up the film onto said take-up spool

   discriminating means for discriminating 
whether there has been any variation in the movement 

speed of said film and outputting a discrimination 
signal. 
A film feeding apparatus in an automatic 
loading type camera designed such that film is fed out 

from a film cartridge to a take-up spool side, 
comprising: 

   a motor; 
   film take-up means driven by said motor to 

rotatively drive said take-up spool at a speed higher 
than the speed at which the film is fed out of said

outer peripheral portion of said take-up spool; 
   reference signal detecting means for 

outputting a pulse signal corresponding to the

   judgment means for judging with the 

generation period of the pulse signal from said 
reference signal detecting means as the reference 

whether the generation period of the pulse signal from 
said film movement amount detecting means has varied, 

and judging that the generation period of said pulse 
signal has varied, thereby discriminating that the 

film has twined around the take-up spool.
