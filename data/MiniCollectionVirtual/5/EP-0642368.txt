<ABSTRACT>
An implantable apparatus for treating ventricular tachycardia, and a method for operating the same, delivers a series of anti-tachycardia stimulation pulses, each of which has energy values of less than 5 joules, and at least one of which is a far-field pulse that is a short, relatively high-voltage pulse delivered through at least two far-field electrodes. The series of anti-tachycardia stimulation pulses are preferably delivered by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) having at least two relatively larger-surface-area defibrillation-style far-field electrodes having a relatively large inter-electrode distance, and, optionally, a pair of smaller-surface-area pacing-style electrodes having a relatively smaller inter-electrode distance. Each series of anti-tachycardia stimulation pulses is delivered as a committed burst of pulses without any intervening monitoring, and with one or more bursts being delivered by the ICD in response to the sensing of a ventricular tachycardia. By using the large surface area defibrillation-style electrodes to deliver at least one of the anti-tachycardia pulses, a far-field stimulation of the myocardium is induced in an effort to simultaneously extinguish the ventricular tachycardia throughout the myocardium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an apparatus used to treat human
heart arrythmia conditions. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an implantable apparatus for treating ventricular tachycardia.Ventricular tachycardia is a racing of the electrical signals within
one or more regions of the ventricular chambers of the myocardium, i.e.,
the heart. Currently, the most accepted explanation for ventricular
tachycardia is that a race condition is somehow started in a closed loop of
myocardium with a diameter on the order of 1 cm, as illustrated in Figure
1. In this closed loop, the path of electrical cell stimulation is essentially
circular, with a path length (circumference) sufficient to permit a given
cell to repolarize, or to recover, from the previous stimulation, before the
wave of cell stimulation comes around the circle the next time. In this
way, the electrical cell stimulation within the closed loop is self sustaining
and races ahead of the normal electrical cell stimulation of the
myocardium.In biomedical terminology, such a closed loop is described as a re-entrant 
loop, terminology which generically identifies a situation where a
path of adjacent-cell stimulation closes on itself, or reenters a previous
path. In the loop case, the activated cells continue to activate cells in a
circular rotation in continuous fashion. Immediately behind the cells just
stimulated are cells that are fairly refractory or resistant to stimulation
having not fully recovered from activation. Farther behind them are cells
that are fully recovered (repolarized), and hence, are amenable to
stimulation or reactivation.This kind of single-source ventricular tachycardia as shown in
Figure 1 generates a rather consistently shaped electrical signal, and hence,
is referred to as a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. If there is more
than one source or more than one re-entrant loop involved in the
tachycardia, then the arrhythmia is referred to as a polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia.Presently, the most common and accepted method for treating
ventricular tachycardia with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
(ICD) is to deliver a series of pacing pulses at a location of the heart remote
to the re-entrant loop. This series of tachycardia pacing pulses is selected
to have a rate that is slightly higher than the rate of the ventricular
tachycardia, and each pulse has an energy of less than about 50
microjoules. The tachycardia pacing pulses are delivered through
conventional pacing electrodes that are
