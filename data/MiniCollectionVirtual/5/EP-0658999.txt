<ABSTRACT>
An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) traffic control framework is based on
an integrated usage parameter control (UPC) approach, which approach provides

a unified and scalable solution to the issue of quality-of-services (QOS) levels over
a range of anticipated services in ATM based networks. Additionally, a UPC-based

call and burst admission control, providing the desired QOS over periods of network
overload by call/burst admission control and traffic shaping of source stream,

preferably uses a dual leaky bucket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) traffic 
control framework based on an integrated usage parameter control (UPC) 
approach. Specifically, the UPC approach provides a unified and scalable solution 
to the issue of quality-of-service (QOS) levels both over a range of anticipated 
services and during periods of network overload. Future broadband networks will be required to support new bandwidth intensive 
applications such as full motion video, teleconferencing, interactive multimedia, 
medical imaging, scientific visualization, distributed computing, distributed 
simulation, client server traffic, etc. These applications will place varying requirements 
in terms of the quality-of-service they receive from the network. Asynchronous 
transfer mode (ATM) technology is now viewed as the primary switching 
and transport technology for emerging high-speed networks, both in wide-area 
and local-area scenarios. While ATM offers the ability to support a range of 
multi-rate services in an integrated manner, technical approaches for maintaining 
quality-of-service in dynamic and heterogeneous traffic environments require further 
development and standardization. In spite of the the promise of abundant bandwidth, ATM may not be able 
to satisfactorily support many QOS sensitive services unless appropriate dynamic 
traffic control is exercised by the network. The underlying philosophy of ATM 
networking is fast generic cell transport with simple switching nodes that scale 
easily with line speed and number of ports. The cell-level control in these nodes 
is generally quite minimal to avoid complex high-speed processing. Application-specific 
switching node architectures are considered to be neither desirable nor 
necessary. The lack of strong cell level controls at each ATM switching node, coupled 
with the fact that ATM based switches have a limited amount of buffering 
(due to technological as well as scaling limitations), can result in traffic hot spots 
and other congestion related problems within the network. Further, the cell-based 
nature of the transport can result in server performance degradation under overload  
 
due to cell loss and consequent retransmission of data. The applications anticipated in broadband networks have traffic characteristics 
that are very different from those of current applications. Many of these 
applications require rapid movement of large quantities of data across the network, 
which can overwhelm the buffers in the ATM switches, resulting in
