<ABSTRACT>
To ensure interference-free transmission of digital messages, very high demands are made on the accuracy and stability of the clock generators. It is known to use for this purpose microprocessor-controlled digital phase-locked loops and to use for this expensive highly stable crystal oscillators. An accurate system clock should be delivered even if the reference clock fails. Contradictory demands are made on the phase-locked loops, on the one hand a wide bandwidth to achieve a small phase timing error and on the other hand a narrow bandwidth in order to keep down the influence of jitter and wander on the clock accuracy when the reference clock fails. It is the object of the invention to specify a circuit arrangement for an inexpensive clock generator which should deliver a highly accurate clock frequency even when the reference clock fails. According to the invention, the contradictory demands on a phase-locked loop are distributed over two phase-locked loops, both of which are controlled by a microprocessor and which are allocated only one oscillator. A first phase-locked loop (1) having a narrow bandwidth is connected via a change-over switch (3) to a second phase-locked loop having a wide bandwidth. When the reference clock fails, the output clock of the first phase-locked loop (1) is switched as reference clock to the second phase-locked loop (2).

A circuit arrangement for a clock generator in
digital communications networks which generates a clock

signal that is compared in frequency and phase with a
reference clock signal, 
characterized
in that
 a first phase-locked loop (1) is connected
via a switch (3) to a second phase-locked loop (2), that

during normal operation, a reference clock signal is
applied directly to the first phase-locked loop (1) and

is applied to the second phase-locked loop (2) through
the switch (3), and that in the event of a failure of

the reference clock signal, the switch (3) is caused to
apply, instead of the reference clock signal, the output

of the first phase-locked loop (1) to the second phase-locked
loop (2), which provides the system clock signal.
A circuit arrangement for a clock generator as
claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the first and

second phase-locked loops each comprise a phase detector
(11, 21) and a variable-frequency oscillator which

consists of a fixed-frequency generator (4) associated
with both phase-locked loops and followed in each

phase-locked loop by a register (13, 23) and an adder
(12, 22), said variable-frequency oscillator being

microprocessor-controlled according to the output
signal from the respective phase detector (11, 21),

and that the output of the phase detector (11) of the
first phase-locked loop and the output of the phase

comparator (21) of the second phase-locked loop are
connected to a microprocessor (5) which, in turn, is

connected to the adders (12, 22) in the first and 
second phase-locked loops.
A circuit arrangement for a clock generator as
claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the adder

(22) of the second phase-locked loop is followed by an
analog phase-locked loop (24) for filtering jitter.
