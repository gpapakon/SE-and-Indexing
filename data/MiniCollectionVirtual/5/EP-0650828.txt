<ABSTRACT>
A laminated body having a sheet-like supporting part made of a consolidated base nonwoven (coating substrate) with a content of thermoplastic fibres, which is provided at least on one side with a plastic-containing outer layer, is characterised in that the base nonwoven is bonded to the outer layer by the application of pressure and heat via an intermediate layer which has a thermoplastic content, is of a different or the same material as that of the synthetic fibres of the base nonwoven and the softening temperature of which lies above that of the synthetic fibres of the base nonwoven. Also disclosed are methods of production and use thereof.
