<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to game machines fitted with electronic coin testers. It consists in replacing the conventional coin tester by a coin tester (114) operating with the aid of secure tokens (115) by contactless detection and in additionally fitting this machine with a second coin tester (124) operating with the aid of a microchip card. Switching means (413) make it possible to pass from the token type coin tester to the microchip card type coin tester when such a card is inserted into the corresponding coin tester. It makes it possible to increase the efficiency of game machines.

<CLAIMS>
A gaming machine with an electronic validator
comprising a first secure token (115) validator (114)

with contact-free detection, and a second chip card
validator (124) associated to switching means (413) to

be used with either of these two validators, in which
the switching means (413) give priority to the first

validator (114) and transfer to the second validator
(124) upon detecting the insertion of a chip card in

this second validator, in which the second validator is
able to add and deduct credit to and from the chip

card, in which the gaming machine also comprises a
sorting machine, which comprises a sorting channel

(502) and a series of traps (508), in which the sorting
channel (502) comprises a series of rollers (504,505)

provided with an external semi-crown and driven in
continuous rotation by a series of gears (506,507) in

such a way that the secure tokens (115) inserted in
this channel can pass from one roller to the next, and

in which the traps of the series of traps (508) are
placed in front of the rollers in order to enable the

secure token to be ejected when it passes through the
roller that corresponds to its face value.
A secure token (115) validator (114) for a
machine according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 it
comprises means (307) for immobilising the token in a

position that allows a transaction with the recognition
means to have enough time to conduct this transaction. 
A chip card validator (124) for a machine
according to either claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 it comprises an interface (412) that allows it to
emit and receive identical signals to those emitted and

received by the electronics (108) of a known gaming
machine.
A validator according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 it comprises, among others an
input (414) intended to receive signals that count the

distribution by a hopper (106) of tokens won in order
to memorise the number of these tokens during the

operation of the machine using tokens.
A validator according to either of the claims
3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 it comprises an output
terminal (415) that allows it to send command signals

for the switching means (413) between the first and
second validators.
A gaming machine according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the sorting machine also
comprises a series of pistons (510) that pass through

the inside of the axes of the rollers in order to expel
the tokens when the traps are opened.
