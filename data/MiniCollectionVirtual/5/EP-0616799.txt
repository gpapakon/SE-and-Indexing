<ABSTRACT>
A cosmetic composition which includes: 

a) membrane lipids dispersed in the form of liposomes; 
b) un-neutralized salicylic acid localized within the 
membrane lipid bilayer of the liposome; 
c) other cosmetic ingredients located in either the 
membrane compartment, or in either of the external or internal 

aqueous compartments or some combination thereof; 
d) an organic, water-soluble membrane-impermeant base; 
and, 
e) water. 
 
This composition enables the inclusion of salicylic acid as the 

free acid in products of neutral pH.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liposomal dispersions
containing un-neutralized salicylic acid and a process for their
preparation. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a cosmetic dispersion that allows for the incorporation of
large amounts of salicylic acid within the hydrophobic
compartment of the liposomal bilayer, without the necessity of
pre-neutralization or salt formation of the corresponding
salicylate, while simultaneously permitting the pH of the
external aqueous compartment to be adjusted with soluble organic
bases.Salicylic acid is an active ingredient long-known to those
skilled in the formulation of cosmetic and topical products.
Dandruff has been treated with ointments containing 2 percent
salicylic acid. As a keratolytic agent, salicylic acid will
soften and swell the epidermis. At concentrations higher than
2 percent, salicylic acid is an efficacious anti-acne agent and
is bactericidal. The formation of salts of salicylic acid, such
as sodium salicylate formed by the combination of salicylic acid
and sodium hydroxide, greatly improves the water solubility of
the free acid, but substantially modifies the biological
response to salicylic acid.Salicylic acid is nearly insoluble in water (limit of
solubility approximately 0.2 percent at room temperature). When
incorporated into cosmetic solutions, salicylic acid requires
the addition of cosolvents such as ethanol, isopropanol or
dimethylsulfoxide. These solutions exhibit low pH
(approximately 2), and as a consequence may be irritating to the
skin. Development of aesthetic cosmetic formulations under
these constraints of pH greatly limits the range of formulation
types. For example, hydrocolloid gels will not form at this
extreme of pH. Many other cosmetic ingredients are rendered
unstable under these conditions.A general reference for the formulation of cosmetic
compositions containing salicylic acid follows: Wilkinson, J.B. and Moore, R.J. Harry's Cosmeticology
(Seventh Edition), 1982, Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New
York, New York, pp. 19, 45, 122, 687, 366.A general refernce for the application of liposomes to
cosmetics follows:Hayward, J.A. and Smith, W.P. Potential Applications of
Liposomes in Cosmetic Science, in Cosmetic and Toiletries, 105:
47 - 54, 1990.The Won U.S. Patent No. 5,145,675 is related to a topical
delivery system for active ingredients such as salicylic acid,
whereby controlled release is achieved by the gradual desorption
of the active ingredient from solid, porous particles.The Cioca et al. U.S
