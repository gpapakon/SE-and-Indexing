<ABSTRACT>
A method of automatically creating control sequence 
software required for a machine system controlled by a 

computer comprises four algorithms, that is, "derivation of 
control sequence specification" → "derivation of a qualitative 

control sequence" → "addition of quantitative information 
(derivation of a quantitative control sequence)" → 

"generation of a C program". The qualitative control sequence 
is a state transition matrix following the time 

sequence. This qualitative control sequence is derived by 
making use of a qualitative inference system. A quantitative 

control sequence is obtained by adding quantitative 
time between states to the qualitative control sequence. 

Time information is calculated on the basis of design information 
of a machine portion stored in a design information 

database 5. As a result, it is possible to reduce the 
manual burden on the software development by using the 

present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
automatically creating control sequence software required 
for a machine system controlled by a computer and an 
apparatus for realizing the automatic creating method. At the present time computer civilization advances, 
many machine systems are provided with computers, and the 
machine systems are controlled by the computers. Description is made by taking a copying machine as an 
example. Electronic implementation and computerization of 
the copying machine have advanced, so that the operation of 
the copying machine is always controlled by a computer. In 
the development of the copying machine, therefore, not only 
the development of a machine portion but also the increase 
in the amount of work for developing software and 
particularly, control sequence software has become 
significant. This is one great cause of preventing work 
time and the development cycle from being shortened. Therefore, some studies have already been 
conducted to attempt to automatically create software and  
 
control sequence software. Examples are an article entitled 
"Toward Automation of Software Design" by Setsuo Osuga and 
Haruno Ri, Journal of Institute of Artificial Intelligence, 
Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 159-166, 1991, and an article entitled 
"System for Automatically Creating Sequence Control Software" 
by Yasuko Nakayama, Katsuya Sadashige, Hiroyuki Mizutani, 
Minemoto Izaki, Materials for Study Meeting of Institute 
of Artificial Intelligence SIG-KBS-9003, pp. 71-79, 
Institute of Artificial Intelligence, 1990. Even if techniques 
in the conventional studies conducted to attempt to 
automatically create software or the like are directly 
applied to a copying machine or a general image forming 
apparatus or the other machine systems, however, sufficient 
results cannot be obtained. One of the reasons is that the 
conventional technique of automatically creating software is 
not integrated with a machine system CAD. That is, it is 
difficult to organically relate control sequence software 
automatically created to the mechanical technique of the 
machine system (attribute values of parts, structure information 
and the like). An object of the present invention is to provide a 
method of automatically creating control sequence software 
and an apparatus therefor which are solutions to the 
conventional problems.  In order to automatically create control sequence 
software according to the present invention, an objective 
machine system must satisfy the following conditions as
