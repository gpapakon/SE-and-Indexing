A process for producing titanium dioxide by the 
sulphate process by continuous digestion of titanium 

raw material with sulphuric acid with the formation of 
a digestion cake, with subsequent maturation of the 

digestion cake, dissolution of the digestion cake with 
the formation of a titanyl sulphate solution, 

optionally separation of undissolved solids, 
hydrolysis of the titanyl sulphate solution with the 

formation of titanium oxide hydrate and dilute acid 
and calcination of the titanium oxide hydrate to give 

titanium dioxide, characterised in that a mixture of 
55 - 100 wt.% of a titanium-containing digestion 

residue from the production of titanium dioxide by the 
sulphate process and 0 - 45 wt.% of a fine
ly divided 
titanium ore, in particular ilmenite, is used as 

titanium raw material, digestion is performed at 
temperatures of 220째C to 350째C, maturation takes place 

at a temperature between 
>
300째C and 550째C with 
residence times between 15 minutes and 3 hours and 

dissolution of the digestion cake takes place with the 
addition of a reducing agent. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a mixture of 55 - 95 wt.%, preferably 70 to 90 wt.%, 

of a titanium-containing digestion residue from 
titanium dioxide production by the sulphate process 

and 5 - 45 wt.%, preferably 10 to 30 wt.%, of a finely 
divided titanium ore, in particular ilmenite, is used 

as titanium raw material.  
 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a titanium-containing digestion residue from titanium 

dioxide production by the sulphate process is used as 
titanium raw material. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that digestion is performed 

continuously in a screw reactor and maturation takes 
place continuously in a revolving tube. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that material from the thickener 

underflow, rotary filter discharge, from fine 
filtration and/or from filter press discharge is used 

as digestion residue material. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that freshly prepared 94 - 99 wt.% 

strength sulphuric acid, oleum, concentrated, recycled 
dilute acid or mixtures thereof are used as sulphuric 

acid. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that before digestion the ratio by 

weight of TiO
2
 from the digestion residue and ilmenite 
to H
2
SO
4
 from sulphuric acid, oleum and concentrated 
dilute acid is adjusted to a value of 1:1.5 to 1:3.5. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that one or more metals from the 

group consisting of iron, aluminium and zinc are used 
as reducing agent.  

 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that enough reducing agent is used 

for the titanium(III)-content of the titanyl sulphate 
solution to be 0.1 to 4 g/l, preferably 0.5 to 2.0 

g/l, calculated as TiO
2
.
