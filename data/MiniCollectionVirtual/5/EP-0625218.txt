Process for surface-modification by physico-chemical reactions with the steps: 

(a) contacting a solid surface having a crystalline or amorphous structure with a reactive, 
gaseous fluid (gas, gas mixture, vapor or vapor mixture) which is to interact with the 

surface, 
(b) supplying activating energy to the contact area between fluid and surface by means 
of ions or plasmas, in order to trigger reactions between said partners, 
 
wherein the activating energy is supplied in the form of at least doubly charged ions with 

low kinetic energy, or by streams of plasmas, which contain a high, arithmetically 
averaged charge state q
m
 
>
 2 and therefore a great proportion of at least doubly 
charged ions with low kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy of the ions is determined 

by the condition that the ions are allowed to closely approach the atoms at the surface, 
but not to penetrate the surface, however. 
The process according to claim 1,
 
wherein the surface modification comprises an etching process. 
The process according to claim 1,
 
wherein the surface modification comprises a coating or a depositing process. 
The process according to one of the preceding claims,
 
wherein said fluid is provided as spatially homogeneous atomic or molecular beams 

directed toward said surface at an arbitrarily selected angle in high or ultra-high vacuum 
such that said low kinetic energy, highly charged ions are injected from a region of 

vacuum, traverse a limited region of gas layer, and then impinge said surface. 
The process according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
 
wherein the reaction takes place at arbitrary temperatures of the surface, especially at 

temperatures significantly below 600° C down to below 0° C.

physico-chemically activated by said low kinetic energy, highly charged ions.

wherein the flux and the adsorption of said fluid at said surface is adapted, under 
consideration of the activation, to the ion beam or plasma density such that said low

the surface in the form of intermittent pulses, where the quantity of a puls of said fluid 

corresponds to one to three mono-layers of adsorbed fluid, and the quantity of the ion 
puls is adapted to the necessary activating energy of these adsorbed mono-layers.

wherein said fluid is produced by sputtering of a solid material, boron for instance, with 

ions having a high kinetic energy in close proximity to said surface to be modified. 
The process according to one of the preceding claims,
 
wherein said process of etching or coating is initially started with relatively high kinetic 

energy of the highly charged ions which is then, during the further course of etching or 
coating, reduced to very low kinetic energy, in order to efficiently penetrate into deeper 

layers of the substrate at the beginning of the etching, or to create a good adhesion at 
the beginning of the coating by linking to crystalline defects, and then to continue
