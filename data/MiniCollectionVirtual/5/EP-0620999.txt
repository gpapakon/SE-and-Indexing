<ABSTRACT>
The device for putting on elastic stockings without a tip comprises a sliding part (1) and a base plate (5). The sliding part (1) consists of a material which has good sliding properties relative to the elastic stocking and to the skin and has a flexible, inherently rigid sole part (2) which extends approximately over the foot length and a side part (3) which is connected laterally to said sole part and in the heel region. The sole part (2) is provided, on its upper side in the heel and/or ball region, with an adhesive spot (14, 15) with a high friction coefficient relative to the skin. The base plate (5) consists of elastically resilient material, preferably foam rubber. It is placed with its underside (5b) on the floor (F) and the leg section of the elastic stocking is placed on the upper side of said base plate having a braking effect. The sole part is pushed into the leg opening (B) and the foot is then placed on the sole part (2) and the adhesive spots (14, 15). When the foot is pushed forwards, the elastic stocking is held by frictional engagement relative to the base plate (5) due to the high friction resistance achieved between the upper side (5a) and the outer side of the elastic stocking (K) while the foot which has very good sliding capability due to the sole part (2) is pushed with the latter further into the elastic stocking. By means of the side part (3), the sliding part (1) can be pulled out through the leg opening (B) after the elastic stocking has been put on.
