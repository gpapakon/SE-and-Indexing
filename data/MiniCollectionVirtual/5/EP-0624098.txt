<ABSTRACT>
By carrying out the conjugation reaction of an antiviral phosphorylated nucleoside, particularly arabinoside adenine monophosphate, in form of an imidazolide, with lactosaminated human albumin at a pH higher than 7.5, molar ratios drug/L-HSA at least equal to those using ECDI without the problems and negative side effect observed in these latter are obtained. Preferably, the conjugation reaction is carried out at a temperature of 37  DEG C and a pH of 8.5-9.5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to the preparation of conjugates of antiviral nucleosides
and, more particularly to a conjugation process of phosphoric esters of antiviral
nucleosides with lactosaminated human albumin.It is known, that, to reduce the side effects of antiviral nucleosides in the treatment
of chronic hepatitis B, two of these drugs, namely arabinoside adenine (ara-A) and
Acyclovir (ACV), have been conjugated with lactosaminated human albumin (L-HSA)
(Fiume L, Bassi B., Busi C., Mattioli A. and Spinosa G., Drug targeting in antiviral
chemotherapy. A chemically stable conjugate of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-adenine
5'-monophosphate with lactosaminated albumin accomplishes a selective delivery of
the drug to liver cells, Biochem. Pharmacol., 35, 967, 1986;
Fiume L., Bassi B., Busi C., Mattioli A., Spinosa G. and Faulstich H., Galactosylated
poly (L-lysine) as a hepatotropic carrier of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine
5'-monophosphate, FEBS Letters, 203, 203, 1986).L-HSA is a neoglycoprotein which penetrates selectively into the hepatic cells (Wilson
G., Effect of reductive lactosamination on the hepatic uptake of bovine pancreatic
ribonuclease A dimer, J. Biol. Chem., 253, 2070, 1978) where it is digested in the
lysosomes (Ashwell G. and Harford J., Carbohydrate specific receptors of the liver
Ann. Rev. Biochem, 51, 531, 1982).Experiments conducted in mice with hepatitis caused by the virus of ectromelia have
shown that the conjugates with the ara-A and with the ACV penetrate selectively in
the liver where they release the drugs in an active form. In patients with cronic
hepatitis induced by virus B, the ara-A bound to the L-HSA inhibited the viral
replication at a dose 3-6 times lower than that of the free antiviral drug. (Fiume L.,
Torrani Cerenzia M.R., Bonino F., Busi C., Mattioli A., Brunetto M.R., Chiaberge E.
and Verme G., Inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication by vidarabine
monophosphate conjugated with lactosaminated serum albumin, Lancet,ii, 13, 1988).In order to bind the ara-A and the ACV with the L-HSA, these compounds have
been phosphorilated at the OH primary group according to Yoshikawa's et al. method
(Yoshikawa M., Kato T. and Takenishi T., A novel method for phosphorylation of
nucleosides to 5'-nucleotides, Tetrahedron Lett. 50, 5065, 1967); the phosphorilated
compounds have been further conjugated with the L-HSA with the use of
1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (ECDI), adjusting the pH of the
reaction medium to 7.5 before adding ECDI and prolonging the reaction for
