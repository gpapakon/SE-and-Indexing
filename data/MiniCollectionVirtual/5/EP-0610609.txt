<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide light-sensitive photographic material for 
applications in the field of mammography is disclosed which has an 

improved diagnostic value by an enhanced sharpness. The silver 
halide crystals to be used in the said material show a fog level, a 

toe contrast and an overall contrast that is, like the image 
quality, substantially uneffected by the processing conditions. The 

coating amount of silver halide crystals in the emulsion layer can 
be reduced to such an amount that an archivability of from 10 to 20 

years can be assured in normal storage conditions. The X-ray 
material is suitable for rapid processing, without loss in 

sensitivity, within processing cycles of 45 or 38 seconds, wherein 
hardener-free processing solutions can be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material suitable for rapid processing applications in the
field of mammography.In medical radiography the direct exposure technique is used in
mammographic applications, wherein the radiation pattern leaving the
patient's breast is registered directly on a film with the use of an
intensifying screen.No other area of medical X-ray applications demands such a level
of contrast and spatial resolution as produced in quality
mammography. This explains why single-sided films are used in this
application.The success of mammography, whether for screening or
diagnosis, depends on the production of high-quality, low-dose
images. Image quality determines the accuracy with wich the various
structures are recorded and abnormalities detected. For mammography,
films high in contrast are preferred. Most of the mammographic films
have a high overall-contrast but also the toe contrast, i.e. the
contrast in the region of the lightest areas on the film is
important. Dense structures in the breast give rise to pale areas on
the mammograms. When the degree of contrast is low in this area,
i.e. well below the linear portion of the characteristic curve, this
area is underexposed. The degree of contrast that can be obtained in
this low density area, would be increased, if the film density level
is increased within the linear portion of the characteristic curve.
This can be achieved by increasing exposure (mAs) or X-ray tube
potential (kV). In this way, dense structures in the breast would be
less often underexposed, but there are some disadvantages. By
increasing the mAs, less dense breast structures may become
overexposed, and the most important disadvantageous factor, the
dose, is increased. Besides the disadvantage of a decreasing
contrast by increasing kV a loss of information may be the resulting
effect.As is generally known for one skilled in the art of photography 
the sensitometric values and the image quality of a photographic
light-sensitive material do not only depend on the characteristics
of the emulsion or the composition of the material but are
determined also to a considerable extent by the processing
conditions. Contrast, speed, and thus also the perceptable detail is
affected by processing conditions such as the type of the selected
developer, the developer temperature, the degree of development and
the condition of the processor. E.g. it is common knowledge that the
slope of the characteristic curve of a photographic material
increases
