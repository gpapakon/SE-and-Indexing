<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a tubular 
element (2) for supporting washing brushes (20), which has 

been specifically designed for motor vehicle 
automatic washing systems, the main feature of which 

is that the tubular element (2) comprises an extruded 
tubular body (2), of circular, or square or polygonal 

cross-section, which defines integral longitudinal 
ribs (3) on the inner surface thereof, the longitudinal 

ribs (3) being hollow so as to define recesses (4) for 
engaging therein screws for connecting the coupling 

flange (10) of an electric motor (11) for rotatively driving 
the tubular body (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tubular element
for supporting washing brushes, for application to automatic
motor vehicle washing systems and the like.As is known, in motor vehicle automatic washing
systems there are conventionally used washing brushes,
of large size, which practically comprise a cylindric
body on the surface of which there are applied plate-like
elements, provided with bristles, which are circumferentially
arranged on the cylindric body.The cylindric body, in particular, comprises an iron
tubular element which, as it is made, must be cut to a
desired size, and then subjected to an operation step in
which a flange is applied to one end of the tubular element,
as the latter has a vertical axis, or two flanges are
applied to the end portions of said tubular element, as
the latter has a horizontal axis.These flanges, which are applied to the end portions
of the tubular element, are then subjected to a
welding step for making rigid the flanges with said tubular
body, said flanges being used for coupling a respective
driving electric motor.After this operation, the tubular body is subjected to
a straightness test, since the welding operation is susceptible
to cause disalignments and, accordingly, it is
necessary to perform a specific operation for re-aligning
the outer surface of the tubular element by applying, by
a suitable torch, a weld recovering material for recovering
the outer surface of the tubular element to a perfectly
rectilinear condition.Thus, for making that prior tubular element, are necessary
several operating steps, which are very expensive
and which must be performed by skilled operators.Accordingly, the aim of the present invention is to
solve the above mentioned problem, by providing a tubular
element for supporting washing brushes, specifically
designed for motor vehicle automatic washing systems,
which tubular element can be directly coupled to
the motor connecting flanges without the need of performing
complex processing step thereon.Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, a
main object of the present invention is to provide such
a tubular element which can be connected in a very
quick and safe manner to the motor assembly coupling
flanges, the connection practically requiring exclusively
screwing-on operations.Another object of the present invention is to provide
such a tubular element which, owing to its constructional
features, is very reliable and safe in operation.Yet another object of the present invention is to provide
such a tubular element which can
