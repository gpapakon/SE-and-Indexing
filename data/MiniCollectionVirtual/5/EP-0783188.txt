<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter arranged to be capable of easily 
improving a spurious characteristic in a mode other than a 

fundamental mode (TEM mode). Two resonator holes having 
inner conductors formed on their inner surfaces are formed 

through a dielectric block between a pair of end surfaces. 
An outer conductor is formed on outer surfaces of the 

dielectric block. A through hole is formed through a 
central portion of the dielectric block between two major 

surfaces of the block, and a shorting conductor is formed on 
the inner surface of the through hole to be connected to 

outer conductor portions on the two major surfaces of the 
dielectric block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric filter
using transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode and constructed
by forming a plurality of inner conductors in a dielectric
block and by forming an outer conductor on outer surfaces of
the dielectric block and, more particularly, to a dielectric
filter of this construction having an improved spurious
response characteristic.Fig. 8 shows the structure of a conventional dielectric
filter using TEM mode. In Fig. 8 and similar illustrations
referred to below, a dotted area represents an exposed
portion of a dielectric block (non-conductor- formation
portion).In this dielectric filter, as shown in Fig. 8, two
resonator holes 2a and 2b are formed through a dielectric
block 1 in the form of a rectangular prism so as to be open
in a pair of opposite end surfaces of the dielectric block
1. An inner conductor 3 which functions as a resonating
conductor is formed on the inner cylindrical surface of each
of the resonators 2a and 2b. An outer conductor 4 which
functions as a ground conductor is formed generally over all
the outer surfaces of the dielectric block 1. A pair of
input/output electrodes 5 are formed in predetermined
portions of the outer conductor 4. Each of the resonator
holes 2a and 2b has an non-conductive section 3a, on which
the inner conductor is not formed and which is formed in the
vicinity of one opening end surface of the resonator hole to
separate (maintain in the open state) the inner conductor 3
from the outer conductor 4. At the other opening end of the
resonator hole (at the rear side as viewed in Fig. 8), the
inner conductor 3 is electrically connected (shorted) to the
outer conductor 4. The input/output electrodes 5 are
externally coupled with the corresponding inner conductors 3
by external coupling capacitances created between the
input/output electrodes 5 and the inner conductors 3.This dielectric filter is formed of two stages of
resonators formed respectively at the resonator holes 2a and 
2b. The resonators are coupled in a comb-line manner by the
stray capacitances created at the open ends by the
non-conductive sections 3a formed in the vicinity of the
open end surfaces. The thus-constructed dielectric filter,
having the resonators coupled with each other by
non-conductive sections 3a, requires no coupling means such
as a coupling hole formed between resonator holes 2a and 2b
to couple the resonators in TEM mode, and therefore has the
advantage of being capable of being reduced in size.Ordinarily, this kind of dielectric filter uses
