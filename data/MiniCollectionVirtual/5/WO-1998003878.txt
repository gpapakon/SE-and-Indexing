<ABSTRACT>
An anti-friction bearing (2) consisting of an outer ring (8) mounted around an inner ring (10) is disclosed. One of the seals (14) that seal the bearing (2) incorporates an encoding element rotationally secured to the rotating ring (8), and comprises a core element with a radial extension extending along the side surface of the rotating ring (8) of the bearing (2). A hub (1) comprising such a bearing (2) is also disclosed. The thickness, in the axial direction of the bearing (2), of the radial extension of the core element of the seal (14) that includes the encoding element is the same as the axial offset caused between the stub-axle carrier (4) of the hub (1) and the inner ring (10) of the bearing (2) by the means for attaching the sensor element to the stub-axle carrier (4).
