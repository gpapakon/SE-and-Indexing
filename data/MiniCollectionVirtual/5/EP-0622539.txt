<ABSTRACT>
A rocket engine thrust nozzle assembly is 
disclosed wherein combustion products from a plurality 

of rocket engines (14) having hexagonally-shaped exhaust 
areas (30) flow to the inlet of a main nozzle (12) that 

transitions the flow of the combustion products (24) 
from a non-circular flow area (34) to a circular flow 

area (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rocket engines and
particularly to thrust nozzles for such rocket engines.In a typical space launch vehicle, small payloads
may be satisfactorily launched using only a single
rocket engine. Such rocket engines are well known in
the art, and it is desirable to use multiples of such
rocket engines to launch larger payloads to equal or
higher altitudes. However, when multiple engines are
used on a launch vehicle, certain performance losses
occur which do not occur on a launch vehicle that
utilizes only a single rocket engine.One such performance loss occurs as a result of the
fact that when multiple rocket engines having nozzles
with circular exhaust areas are clustered together, the
interstices between adjacent nozzles (known in the art
as aft-facing base area) form flow paths for ambient air
to be drawn in to the flow of the combustion products,
thereby introducing turbulence into the overall flow
stream of the rocket engines. This turbulence reduces
the overall efficiency of the launch vehicle as compared
to a comparable launch vehicle having a single large
rocket engine. However, because a single large rocket
engine for such applications would be very expensive to
design and manufacture, multiple rocket engine launch
vehicles are utilized despite their associated aft-facing
base area performance loss.What is needed is a nozzle for a multiple rocket
engine launch vehicle that minimizes the performance
loss associated with aft-facing base area.A prior art thrust nozzle for a rocket engine
comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1 is
described in DE-A-2116966. US-A-3115747 describes an
alternative prior art thrust nozzle for a rocket engine
comprising modular rocket engines, but which does not
include a main nozzle surrounding the modular engines. It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a nozzle for a multiple rocket engine launch
vehicle that minimizes the performance loss associated
with aft-facing base area.According to the present invention, there is
provided a thrust nozzle for a rocket engine comprising:
a plurality of modular rocket engines clustered
about a first axis that is perpendicular to a first
plane, each modular rocket engine including a combustion
chamber having a circular cross-section and a circular
discharge hole for discharging combustion products of
the combustion chamber, and a modular nozzle having a
modular nozzle inlet of the same diameter as the
circular discharge hole and connected thereto for
receiving the combustion

<CLAIMS>
A thrust nozzle (10) for a rocket engine
comprising:


a plurality of modular rocket engines (14)
clustered about a first axis (16) that is perpendicular

to a first plane (18), each modular rocket engine
including a combustion chamber (20) having a circular

cross-section and a circular discharge hole (22) for
discharging combustion products (24) of the combustion

chamber, and a modular nozzle (26) having a modular
nozzle inlet (28) of the same diameter as the circular

discharge hole and connected thereto for receiving the
combustion products therefrom and a modular nozzle

outlet (30) for discharging the combustion products from
the modular nozzle; and
a main nozzle (12) having a main nozzle inlet (38)
and a main nozzle outlet (40), said main nozzle inlet

being located in the first plane for receiving the
combustion products from the modular nozzle outlets;

   characterized in that

   each of said modular nozzle outlets defines a
hexagonally shaped exhaust area (34) located in the

first plane (18), said modular nozzle outlets are
clustered together to form a notched-hexagonal shape

(36) in the first plane, and the main nozzle inlet
circumscribes and conforms to the notched-hexagonal

shape.
The thrust nozzle of claim 1 wherein the main
nozzle inlet (38) defines a main nozzle inlet area that

is essentially equal to the sum of the hexagonally
shaped exhaust areas (34).
The thrust nozzle of claim 1 or 2 wherein the main
nozzle outlet (40) defines a circular exhaust area (42).
The thrust nozzle of claim 3 wherein the main
nozzle (12) further comprises means (46) for smoothly 

transitioning the flow of combustion products through
the main nozzle from the notched-hexagonal shape to the

circular exhaust area.
The thrust nozzle of claim 4 wherein the means for
smoothly transitioning the flow of combustion products

comprises an inner surface (46) extending between said
main nozzle inlet and said main nozzle outlet, said

inner surface defining a boundary for flow of the
combustion products through the main nozzle.
The thrust nozzle of any preceding claim wherein
each modular nozzle comprises a tubular wall (48) having

six creases (50), each crease originating at said
modular nozzle outlet and extending toward said modular

nozzle inlet.
The thrust nozzle of claim 6 wherein the creases
of each modular nozzle are equally spaced about the

circumference of the tubular wall thereof.
The thrust nozzle of claim 6 or 7 wherein the

creases of each modular nozzle terminate at the modular
nozzle inlet.
The thrust nozzle of claim 6 or 7 wherein the
creases of each modular nozzle terminate short of the

modular nozzle inlet.
The thrust nozzle of claim 9 wherein each modular
nozzle (26) has a nozzle length (52) defined by the

distance between the modular nozzle inlet and the
modular nozzle outlet thereof, and each modular nozzle

transitions from a substantially circular cross-section
to a substantially hexagonal cross-section at a distance

from the modular nozzle inlet that is substantially 60%
of the nozzle length.
