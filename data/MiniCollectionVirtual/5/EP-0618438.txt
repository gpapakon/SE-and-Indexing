<ABSTRACT>
It is known to linearise the characteristic curve of absorption photometers by means of a higher-order function. According to the present invention, the two mutually interdependent equipment-specific parameters, amplification factor and sag factor of the higher-order function are obtained by taking up two test signals using two test gases. Set values are formed from the known concentrations of the components of the test gases to be measured. Using an iterative method, the amplification factor is approximated on the basis of the difference between the calculated output signal and the set value and the corresponding sag factor is determined. The invention is used primarily in single-beam infrared absorption photometers.
