<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing a friction on a cruising body, a cruising body (Y) with reduced friction, and a method of 
and an apparatus for generating microbubbles for use in reduction of friction, aiming at reducing a frictional resistance 

with a small energy consumption to thereby enhance an overall energy efficiency and make readily practicable a 
measure of reducing a frictional at resistance. A mixed fluid containing bubbles and water is jetted rearwardly and 

obliquely away from the submerged surface (4) of the hull (1) into a boundary layer formed in the vicinity of the 
submerged surface (4) from fluid je
tting nozzles (3) so that a kinetic energy of water having a great mass is utilized 
to inject bubbles more deeply into a desired bottom layer of the boundary layer than in the case where only bubbles 

are injected, for effective reduction of friction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for reducing the 
frictional resistance of a navigating vehicle, and a method and 
an apparatus for generating micro-bubbles for reducing the 
friction in a low friction navigating vehicle. Especially, it 
is related to a technique of jetting micro-bubbles, composed of 
a mixture of air bubbles and water, out from the underwater 
surface of a ship, thereby reducing the frictional resistance as 
well as improving the overall energy utilization efficiency by 
making use of the dynamic energy of the mixture as a thrusting 
force. There have been proposals for creating air bubbles or an 
air layer on the underwater surface of a ship for the purpose of 
reducing the friction of such ships. Examples of the techniques for jetting bubbles into water 
are disclosed in prior art such as: (1) Japanese Patent 
Application, First Publication, S50-83992; (2) Japanese Patent 
Application, First Publication, S53-136289; (3) Japanese Patent 
Application, First Publication, S60-139586; (4) Japanese Patent 
Application, First Publication, S61-71290; (5) Japanese Utility  
 
Model Application, First Publication, S61-39691; (6) Japanese 
Utility Model Application, First Publication, S61-128185. Also, a technique of forming an air layer in a concave part 
of the ship's bottom is disclosed in (7) Japanese Utility Model 
Application, First Publication, S61-128184. These techniques are based on ejecting and blowing the 
pressurized air from a compressor through a plurality of holes 
or porous plates into the water. However, with those methods based on jetting only 
pressurized air though a plurality of holes, it is difficult to 
obtain fine bubbles, and the buoyant air bubbles are easily 
separated from the underwater surface of the ship, resulting 
that the friction reduction is effective only in a narrow range 
of the surface. With the method based on porous plates, a large 
amount of energy is consumed in blowing air bubbles through the 
porous plate, generating a pressure drop through the plate, 
resulting that the consumption of energy used to blow out the 
bubbles is larger than the energy savings in reducing the 
fictional resistance. None of the techniques mentioned in prior 
art (1) through to (6) has matured into a practical technology. 
The technique disclosed in prior art (7) has also not come into 
practice, because it is thought that the large consumption of 
air needed for the technique is impractical. This invention is presented in the view of such existing 
state of the
