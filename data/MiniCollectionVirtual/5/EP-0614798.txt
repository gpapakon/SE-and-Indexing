<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for the 
locking of bicycles, in which system the 

bicycle is locked to a fixed object by 
means of a locking chain (2) by placing 

the frame tube (10) of the bicycle into 
contact with a holding loop (4) and 

threading the chain (2) through the holding 
loop so that the frame tube remains 

between the holding loop and the chain, 
whereupon the chain is locked to the 

bicycle with the lock of the bicycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for the locking of 
bicycles as defined in the preamble of claim 1. In previously known technology, the locking of bicycles is 
generally managed by providing the rear wheel with a fixed 
lock used to block the rotation of the wheel. In addition, 
various extra locks are used to secure a bicycle to an 
existing stand or other fixed structure either by the front 
wheel, by the rear wheel or directly by the frame of the 
bicycle. However, a problem with all previously known solutions 
is that a bicycle locked by its front or rear wheel is 
still very easy to steal. The wheels can be easily removed, 
and the frame, which is always the most expensive part, can 
then be stolen. A detached extra lock used to lock a bicycle 
by its frame leaves too much play between the frame and the 
fixed object, which means that the bicycle can be swung and 
twisted so that it is damaged. Moreover, a detached lock is 
always an extra part which has to be carried along, often 
dangling on the rack and battering the mud-guard, thus 
causing noise and wear. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the 
drawbacks mentioned above and to achieve a reliable, cheap 
and safe locking system which makes it very difficult to 
steal or break a locked bicycle. The locking system of the 
invention is characterized by what is presented in the 
characterization part of the claims. The advantages of the locking system of the invention are 
simplicity, reliability and low price. A further advantage 
is that when a bicycle is locked by its frame to a fixed 
object by means of its own lock which is always carried 
along and is often also accepted by insurance companies, it 
will be very difficult to steal any of the most valuable 
parts of the bicycle, i.e. the frame or the rear wheel. An 
additional advantage is that when a bicycle is locked  
 
tightly by its frame according to the invention, it cannot 
be jerked or twisted in the stand. Therefore, the bicycle 
will emerge from a theft attempt in a better condition than 
one locked by a wheel or loosely by the frame. If a bicycle 
is only locked by its front or rear wheel, jerking and 
twisting will easily damage the wheel rim and the pegs. In the following, the invention is described in detail by 
the aid of examples of its embodiments by referring to the 
attached drawings, in which

System for the locking of bicycles, in which the bicycle 
is locked to a fixed object by means of at least one flexible 

locking element (2) and a lock carried by the bicycle, 
characterized in that, when the bicycle is to be locked to a 

fixed object, the frame tube (10) of the bicycle is placed 
into contact with a holding loop (4) and a chain (2) used as 

a locking element is threaded through said holding loop so 
that the frame tube remains between the holding loop and the 

chain, whereupon the chain is locked to the bicycle by means 
of the lock carried by the bicycle. 
System for the locking of bicycles according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fixed object to which the bicycle 

is locked is a stand (1) secured in the ground and provided 
with a holding loop (4) and a retaining part (5) for the 

frame tube (10) of the bicycle and with a locking chain (2) 
with a locking link (3) which is locked to the lock (7) of 

the bicycle. 
System for the locking of bicycles according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fixed object to which the bicycle 

is locked is a mount (8) attached to a wall (9) or equivalent, 
with a locking chain (2) which is attached by its one 

end to the mount (8) and has a locking link (3) at its other 
end, said chain being provided with a holding loop (4) bent 

to an angle, which holding loop, when the bicycle is to be 
locked, is placed in contact with the frame tube (10) of the 

bicycle, the locking link (3) being threaded through the 
holding loop (4) and locked to the lock (7) of the bicycle. 
System for the locking of bicycles according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fixed object to which the bicycle 

is locked is any suitable upright post, a firm ring or equivalent, 
around which, when the bicycle is to be locked, is 

passed a separate locking chain (2) whose first end is provided 
with a
 holding loop (4) bent to an angle, the locking 
 

operation being performed by bringing the holding loop into 
contact with the frame tube (10) of the bicycle and passing 

a locking link (3) attached to the other end of the locking 
chain (2) through the holding loop so that the frame tube 

remains between the holding loop and the locking chain, said 
locking link (3) being then locked to the lock (7) of the 

bicycle.
