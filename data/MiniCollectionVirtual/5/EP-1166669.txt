<ABSTRACT>
The snowboard boot comprises a sole assembly including a walking sole (1), whose lower front surface (4) comes into contact with the ground, and a reinforcing piece. There is a component (10) in an elastic material interposed between a transverse spindle (5), whose ends engage fixing jaws, and the sole assembly. This element is able to deform to allow a lateral displacement of the boot relative to the fixing.

Snowboarding boot comprising

a sole assembly comprising in particular:

an outsole (1), the lower face (4) of which is intended to come into
contact with the ground;
a reinforcing piece (2);
means (5) for interaction with complementary arrangements of the binding,
said means being mechanically integrated with the sole assembly;
characterized in that
 it comprises an element (10) made of a material having elastic
properties interposed between the interaction means (5) and the sole assembly, said

element (10) being capable of being deformed in order to allow lateral deflection of
the boot in relation to the binding.
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the deformation of the elastic
element takes place by compression or tension in a vertical direction, and by shear in

a horizontal plane.
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the element having elastic
properties has an asymmetric deformation capacity which is different from one side

of the boot to the other.
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it comprises means capable
of limiting asymmetrically the lateral deflection of the boot.
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the interaction means (5) are
anchored in the reinforcing piece (2).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the element (60) made of a
material having elastic properties consists of a zone of the outsole (61).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the element (10) made of a
material having elastic properties is interposed between the outsole (1) and the

interaction means (5). 
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it moreover comprises means
(12) capable of limiting the displacement of the interaction means (5) in relation to

the reinforcing piece (2).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it moreover comprises means
(20) which are capable of bringing about pivoting of the interaction means (5) in

relation to the reinforcing piece (2).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the element (10) interposed
between the reinforcing piece (2) and the interaction means (5) has viscoelastic

properties.
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the interaction means
comprise a transverse spindle (5), the ends (6, 7) of which are intended to be held

captively by complementary arrangements of the binding.
Boot according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a plate (12)
covering the transverse spindle (5), said plate being integrated with the reinforcing

piece (2) by connection means (15).
Boot according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the plate (12) is capable of
sliding in relation to the connection means (15).
Boot according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the transverse spindle (5)
comprises an enlargement (20) which comes into contact with the plate (12).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the interaction means
comprise a transverse plate (4, 5), the ends (46, 47) of which are intended to come

into contact with the binding.
Boot according to Claim 15, 
characterized in that
 it comprises connection
means (53, 55) extending through the plate (45) and anchored in the reinforcing 

piece (42), said plate (45) being capable of sliding in relation to said connection
means (53, 55).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the element interposed
between the interaction means (45) and the sole assembly (112) is formed by at least

one spring working under compression.
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the interaction means
comprise two inserts (75) forming a cavity, which are each arranged on one side of

the boot and are intended to receive arrangements of the binding, each insert (75)
being accommodated in a housing (79) formed in the element (70) made of a

material having elastic properties, said element (70) itself being accommodated in
the outsole (71).
Boot according to Claim 18, 
characterized in that
 the element (70) made of
material having elastic properties is accommodated in a seat (80, 81) which is

integrated with the reinforcing piece (72).
Boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the interaction means
comprise a projection (95) located under the sole (91) and intended to be held

captively by arrangements of the binding.
Boot according to Claim 20, 
characterized in that
 it comprises connection
means (98) extending through the projection (95) and anchored in the reinforcing

piece (92) while passing through the element (90) made of material having elastic
properties, said projection (95) being capable of sliding in relation to the connection

means (98).
