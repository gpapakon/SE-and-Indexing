<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amino acid 
derivative and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof 
having an excellent vasodilator action for collateral 
vessels and an anti-anginal action. Nitroglycerine has so far been most frequently used 
clinically as a therapeutic drug for cardiovascular 
diseases, particularly angina pectoris. However, 
nitroglycerine is susceptible to undergo first-pass effect 
and has short duration of action, disadvantageously. In 
addition, headaque, dizziness, tachycardia due to the 
depression of blood pressure are brought about as side 
effects. There have been desired antianginal drugs for 
clinical treatment which undergo no first-pass effect and 
have excellent duration of action. Meanwhile, as the amino acid derivative having 
anti-anginal action, alanine derivatives, for example, are 
known (e.g. Japan Kokai No. Hei-2-169558). EP-A-0 362 575 discloses 
amino acid derivatives having a terminal nitrooxyalkylene group. The present inventors have prepared for long years a 
series of amino acid derivatives and examined their 
pharmacological actions. As the result, they found that  
 
specific amino acid derivatives have excellent duration of 
vasodilator action for collateral vessels with less side 
effects as well as less drug tolerance and are useful as 
therapeutic drugs, and they accomplished the present 
invention. The amino acid derivative of the present invention has 
the general formula: 
R1NH-CH(R2)-CONH-A-ONO2In the above formula, R1 represents a hydrogen atom, 
a C1-C7 alkanoyl group, a C1-C6 alkoxycarbonyl 
group, a C6-C10 arylcarbonyl group, a C7-C13 
aralkylcarbonyl group, a C7-C13 aralkyloxycarbonyl 
group or a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic carbonyl 
group containing 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms or 
sulfur atoms; 
   R2 represents a C1-C6 alkyl group having a 
substituent (said substituent is a C6-C10 aryl group, 
a mercapto group, a C1-C6 alkylthio group, a C1-C7 
alkanoylthio group, a C1-C6 alkoxycarbonylthio group, 
(5-methyl- or 
5-phenyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methoxycarbonylthio 
group, a C6-C10 arylcarbonylthio group, a C7-C13 
aralkylcarbonylthio group, a 5- or 6-membered aromatic 
heterocyclic carbonylthio group having 1 to 3 nitrogen 
atoms, oxygen atoms or sulfur atoms, a hydroxy group, a 
C1-C6 alkoxy group, a C1-C7 alkanoyloxy group, a  
 
C1-C6 alkoxycarbonyloxy group, a C6-C10 
arylcarbonyloxy group, a C7-C13 aralkylcarbonyloxy 
group, a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic
