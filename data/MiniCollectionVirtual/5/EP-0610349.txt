<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a heat shrinkable sleeve for connecting a pipe and cable, which is manufactured by crosslinking heat shrinkable sheet materials (3) with organoperoxides, silanes or the like, elongating the cross-linked sheet materials (3) and inserting woven fabrics, or synthetic fibers (4) e.g. polyamides, polyesters, polypropylenes and the like, between the sheet materials (3), thereby reducing the costs of equipment and production due to simplified manufacturing processes and providing high breaking strength and providing good break resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat shrinkable sleeve 
for connecting a pipe and cable, and more particularly, to 
the heat shrinkable sleeve comprising a double layer of 
heat shrinkable sheet materials, a woven fabric made of 
synthetic fibres having a crack resistance, such as 
polyamides, polyesters, polypropylenes etc., and 
interposed between said layers of sheet materials, and a 
layer of high molecular polymers melt-attached at least to 
outer faces of the layers of the sheet materials. 
According to the present invention, the costs of equipment 
and production may be reduced owing to a simplified 
manufacturing process of the heat shrinkable sleeve. Generally, the connecting sleeves are wrapped around the 
connecting portions of oil pipelines, pipes for 
transporting chemical materials, gas pipes or all sorts of 
cables so as to protect the connecting portions against 
mechanical abrasion and corrosion due to inflow of 
moisture, or breakage resulting from invasion of insects 
and animals, and contact with chemical materials or all 
kinds of oils and the like.  
 EP 02 45 067 B1 discloses a heat recoverable article 
comprising a layer of polymeric material, a heating 
element and a layer of bonding material. The heating 
element is interposed between the polymeric material and 
the bonding material. According to further embodiments disclosed by EP 02 45 067 
B1 the heat recoverable article may also comprise two 
layers of polymeric material, a heater interposed 
therebetween, two layers of compatability disposed on 
outer faces of the polymeric material layer and a further 
layer of bonding material or three layers of polymeric 
material with connection layers and layers of woven glass 
fibres therebetween, whereby additionally a compatability 
layer and a bonding layer are disposited. Correspondingly, the manufacturing processes and the 
application of such a heat recoverable article are quite 
complicated as a number of different layers are necessary 
for providing the heat recoverable article, see for 
example the compatability layers and the connection 
layers, and a bonding layer is only provided at a layer 
face of the heat recoverable article for directly fixing 
this article at an object. As the bonding layer is only 
provided at this lower face the article is normally more 
than once wrapped around the object to form a fusion bond 
between the bonding layer overlapping the heat recoverable 
article. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a heat shrinkable
