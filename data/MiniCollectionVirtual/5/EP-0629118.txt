<ABSTRACT>
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus has a sloped shelf (1), a vertical front wall (10) and a slidable cassette (30) for pushing merchandise on the shelf towards the front wall (10). A plurality of dividers (20) divide the shelf (1) into compartments (24), each one of which is provided with a cassette (30) into which a portion of the merchandise is placed. The combined weight of the cassette (30) and the merchandise contained therein forces the remainder of the merchandise to the front of the shelf (1) adjacent the front wall (10). At the lower edge of the front wall of the cassette (30) is a rim (31) which contacts the merchandise to the front thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a merchandising apparatus, 
in particular to a gravity feed merchandising apparatus for 
use in retail shops and similar outlets where consumer 
products are on sale to the public. The invention may be used in the following retail sectors 
but has general application throughout the retail 
industry:- 
Supermarkets/Hypermarkets Department stores Convenience stores  Petrol forecourt shops Symbol groups (an arrangement between differently 
owned shops trading under a common trade mark) CTN's (Confectionary/Tobacco/Newsagents)  
The invention addresses specific problems relating to 
prior-art, merchandising apparatus (e.g. modular metal 
shelving) and particularly in relation to their failure 
to:- 
(a) cater adequately for a large variety of modern 
packaged consumer products. (b) utilise efficiently the available selling space 
(known in the industry as "merchandise cube space").  (c) maintain good visual presentation of products 
throughout the daily selling period irrespective of 
light or heavy selling patterns.   The invention also reduces the staff time/cost factor in 
servicing merchandising apparatus by "Merchandisers" whose 
sole purpose is to "feed" the apparatus or shelves with 
replacement products and/or re-arrange the products in a 
visually attractive manner, particularly in heavily shopped 
outlets like supermarkets, forecourts etc. A very important feature of the invention is its ability to 
be retrofitted on existing store equipment using the 
existing modular structures to hang or support the gravity 
feed merchandising apparatus. The invention addresses the various merchandising 
problems/opportunities identified in the retail industry 
under the following headings: 
Prior Art Merchandising Apparatus Consumer Product Packaging Product Mix New Merchandising Technology and Space Management Traditionally, merchandising fittings and apparatus were 
provided by bespoke "shopfitters" as part and parcel of 
shopfitting contracts designed and manufactured 
specifically to suit the retailer's requirements. Many 
such shopfitting contractors still exist today and continue 
to operate in specific retail sectors (e.g. high street 
fashion outlets etc.) but they are in the minority in the 
industry as a whole. The vast majority of merchandising apparatus currently used 
in the industry are modular constructions, mass produced 
in-factory and fitted by shop equipment suppliers catering 
for Department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores,  
 
forecourt shops,

<CLAIMS>
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus comprising a 
sloped shelf (1) for supporting merchandise, a 

substantially upstanding front wall (10) and a slidable 
container (30) for urging or pushing the merchandise 

towards the front wall (10), the container (30) being 
adapted to contain approximately between 10% and 30% of the 

merchandise so as to create the force necessary to push the 
remaining stock of merchandise forward, characterised in 

that the container is fabricated or moulded in a material 
with a low co-efficient of friction and is provided with a 

generally horizontally disposed buffer (31, 42) at the 
lower edge of the front wall of the container for contact 

with merchandise adjacent the container, whereby when an 
item of merchandise is removed from the shelf (1), the 

remaining stock of merchandise is advanced towards the 
front wall (10) under the action of the buffer directing 

the force of the container (30) at the lower edges of the 
merchandise. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
Claim 1, in which the container (30) is substantially of a 

U-shaped construction, with the front wall of the U being 
inclined rearwardly to define an edge (31) which acts as 

the buffer. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
Claim 1 , in which the container is substantially of a 

U-shaped construction having the buffer (42) provided 
at the lower edge of the front wall of the U. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
any one of the preceding claims, in which the shelf (1) is  

 
sloped downwardly from its rear to the front wall (10) and 

has a slidable surface for the container (30). 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
any one of the preceding claims, in which the upstanding 

wall (10) at the front of the shelf is set in a vertical 
plane irrespective of the slope of the shelf. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
any one of the preceding claims, in which the shelf (1) is 

divided longitudinally into a number of compartments (24) 
by a plurality of parallel adjustable dividers (20), with 

each compartment (24) being approximately the width of the 
respective merchandise and with each compartment (24) 

having a container (30) for holding a percentage of the merchandise. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
Claim 6, in which the adjustable dividers (20) extend 

substantially the full depth of the shelf (1)from front to back. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
Claim 6 or 7, in which the dividers (20) are free standing 

'L' shaped elements, with the horizontal arm of the 'L' 
providing a suitable surface for the container (30) to 

slide on. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in 
any one of Claims 6 to 8, in which the dividers (20) are 

substantially flat strip elements attached to the front 
wall (1) and/or a back wall by connectors. 
A gravity feed merchandising apparatus as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims in which the slidable container 

(30) includes ribs, roller bearings or slides to reduce friction 
of the slidable surfaces.
