<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conjugates comprising chemically-defined valency platform molecules coupled to polynucleotides for treating disease such as the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or "lupus"). The invention also relates to the chemically-defined valency platform molecules.A number of compounds have been employed as carriers for biologically useful molecules in preparing conjugates that are alleged to be tolerogenic. For example, Benacerraf, Katz, and their colleagues investigated and described the use of conjugates of the random co-polymer D-glutamic acid/D-lysine, referred to as D-GL in earlier literature (hereinafter D-EK) with haptens and various antigens to induce specific immune tolerance. See US Pats. Nos. 4,191,668 and 4,220,565.Other investigators have studied conjugates of nucleosides or DNA with other carriers. Borel et al.(Science (1973) 182:76) evaluated the ability of isogenic mouse IgG-nucleoside conjugates to reduce the antibody response to denatured DNA in young animals of the NZB mouse strain. In separate studies Parker et al.(J. Immunol. (1974) 113:292) evaluated the effect of denatured DNA conjugate to poly-D-lysine and/or cyclophosphamide on the progression of the above-described syndrome in NZB mice.In a later article (Ann NY Acad Sci (1986) 475:296-306) Borel et al. describe oligonucleotide-immunoglobulin conjugates. Borel et al. (J. Clin Invest (1988) 82:1901-1907 or US Patent No. 4,650,675) have described in vitro studies using conjugates of human immunoglobulin linked to DNA. US Patent No. 5,126,131 (Dintzis et al.) also relates to conjugates comprising carriers and molecules involved in immune responses.Other references describe conjugates of nonimmunogenic polymers and immunogens (Saski et al.,Scand. J. Immun. (1982) 16:191-200; Sehon, Prog. Allergy (1982) 32:161-202; Wilkinson et al.,J. Immunol. (987) 139:326-331, and Borel et al.,J. Immunol. Methods (1990) 126:159-168).In commonly-owned US Application Serial No. 07/914,869 (US Patent No. 5,276,013), US Patent No. 5,162,515 and US Application Serial No. 07/652,648 (US Patent No. 5,268,454) and in EP-A-0438259, conjugates comprising polymeric carriers such as D-EK, polyethylene glycol, poly-D-lysine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and immunoglobulins are described.Efimov et al, Bioorganicheskaya Khimiya, vol. 19, no. 8, 800-804, 1993 discloses a method for the synthesis of 3'-, 5'- and 3', 5'-PEG-oligonucleotide conjugate molecules.
