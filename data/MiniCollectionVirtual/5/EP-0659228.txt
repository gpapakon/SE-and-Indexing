<ABSTRACT>
In a window (1) a frame (2) is pivotably inserted in a casement (3) by means of swinging armatures, the side pieces (47) of the casement being provided with longitudinal grooves (25) in order to guide sliding armatures (15), which belong to sliding arms (24) and are positioned at the top of the side pieces (4) of the frame and designed to retain this frame end in the casement, when the frame is swung e.g. 180 . In accordance with the invention the sliding armature (15) is provided with a locking shoulder (36), which, when the frame is closed, protrudes above the frame roughly parallel to said groove and is designed to, in the closing phase, mesh with a recess (40) in the upper piece of the casement and be pressed against its wall (49), turned away from the groove (25), in order to partly form a burglary protection and partly provide an extra sealing effect for this part of the frame against the corresponding casement part. The fastening end (26) of the swinging arm (22) of the sliding armature is by a bending parallel-displaced in relation to the main part (23) of the arm, which allows a swinging of mainly only said main part with its thickness in the respective gap (51) between the casement and the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a window, a
door or the like in accordance with the preamble of
claim 1.The object of slider fixtures is to position
e.g. a window frame in relation to a surrounding casement,
when the frame is being turned away by means of
swinging armatues, which allow the frame to swing 180°
in order to be able to wash, clean and paint windows.
The term "position" means, that the end of the window
frame, which is provided with existing armatures, is
allowed to slide along the casement without being
allowed to leave the same, while the other end of the
window frame is swung around. A window according to
the preamble of claim 1 is known from GB-A-2 247 914.Slider fixtures for individual mounting independently
of the swinging armatures are already known
per se through e.g. US-A-3 721 044 and US-A-4 158
933. The drawback of such fixtures is that they are complicated
and weak. They require several working
moments to be manufactured as well as to be fastened
in a frame. Partly they require a special machining of the
casement in order to make guide and/or compensation
grooves for swelling. Also, unfavorable forces may arise,
why angular loads and leverage may disturb and possibly
damage the fastening. The fixtures often jeopardize
a satisfactory and lasting sealing of e.g. a frame against
the surrounding casement, particularly within that portion
of the frame, which is provided with the slider fixtures.
Finally, these known fixtures do not provide any
substanital burglary protection.The object of the present invention is to eliminate
the above-mentioned drawbacks and suggest a
slider fixture, which is superior in these respects and
develops the background art in this field.This object is attained according to the present
invention by designing a window, a door or the like,
of the type mentioned in the
introduction mainly according to the characterizing
clause of claim 1.Additional features of and advantages of the
invention will be explained in the following detailed
description, reference being made to the enclosed
drawings, which show a few preferred but not scope of
protection-limiting embodiments. The drawings show in
detail:
Fig. 1 a vertical sectional view of a casement with a
window frame, which is inserted in the casement
and provided with a swinging armature and a slider
fixture;Fig. 2 a partial enlargement of the view according to
Fig. 1;Fig. 3 a view which is similar to Fig. 2, the frame
and the slider fixture being positioned in the final
phase of the closing of the frame;Fig. 4
