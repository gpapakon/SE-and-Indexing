<CLAIMS>
Use, as an adhesive, of an aqueous dispersion 
containing a polyurethane which contains less than 0.6% 

by weight, based on the polyurethane, of urea groups 
(Mg = 56 g/mol) 


Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polyurethane 
is essentially composed of 


a) organic diisocyanates or a mixture of organic 
isocyanate compounds having an arithmetic mean NCO 

functionality of from 1.9 to 2.3, 
b) dihydroxy compounds having a molecular weight of 
from more than 500 to 5,000 g/mol and containing no 

ionic group or group convertible into an ionic 
group, 
c) monohydric to trihydric alcohols which additionally 
contain an ionic group or a group convertible into 

an ionic group, 
d) if required, dihydric alcohols having a number 
average molecular weight of from 62 to 500 or a 

mixture of alcohols, which mixture has an arithmetic 
mean functionality, based on OH groups, of from 1.9 

to 2.3 and a number average molecular weight of from 
62 to 500 and which alcohols contain no ionic group 

or group convertible into an ionic group and 
e) if required, monohydric polyether alcohols. 
Use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein dihydroxy 
compounds b) are polyether alcohols.  

 
Use as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
compounds c) are dihydroxycarboxylic acids. 
Use of an aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4 as a laminating adhesive. 
Use of an aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4 as an adhesive for laminated films. 
Adhesive bond obtainable using an aqueous dispersion 
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4.
