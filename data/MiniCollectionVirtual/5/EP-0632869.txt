<DESCRIPTION>
 BALL-AND-SOCKET ASSEMBLYThe present invention relates generally to a ball-and-socket assembly, and in particular to an excep¬ tionally strong ball-and-socket assembly which prevents the ball from being removed from the socket. It is typical for ball-and-socket assemblies to be assembled in a manufacturing plant where various types of machinery are available to perform operations such as a crimping of the socket containing member around the ball head. In one application, a ball-and-socket connection is utilized between a hydraulic brake booster assembly and a rod attached to the brake pedal of the vehicle. The ball head of the brake pedal rod is typically inserted into the socket, which may be made of plastic or other materials, and then the socket containing member is crimped by a machine so that the ball head is captured within the socket. However, it is sometimes necessary that the brake pedal rod be attached to the hydraulic brake booster in the field where such machinery is not available. Thus, a ball-and-socket assembly is highly desirable which can be assembled with equal ease both in a factory and in the field. It is necessary that the assembly be accomplished without the utilization of any machinery, with the utilization of perhaps only hand tools, and that the ball-and-socket assembly provide an exceptionally strong coupling so that the brake pedal rod is essentially attached permanently to the hydraulic brake booster assembly.The present invention provides solutions to the above problem by providing a ball-and-socket assembly, comprising a body having therein a multidiameter bore, the multidiameter bore comprising a flared entrance wall communicating with an open end of the body, a shoulder defined by an end of the flared entrance wall and a large diameter portion of the bore, a small diameter portion located axially interiorly of the bore relative to the 

large diameter portion, the small diameter and large diameter portions of the bore connected by a frustoconical wall extending radially outwardly in an axial direction corresponding to an axial direction of radial extension of the flared entrance wall, a rod having a ball head thereon, the ball head including a groove thereabout, and a flexible member disposed within said groove and extending radially outwardly therefrom and beyond the shoulder, the flexible member movable diametrically, relative to the ball head, by engagement with the frusto¬ conical wall as the rod is pivoted.One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail

 BALL-AND-SOCKET ASSEMBLY
CLAIMS
1. A ball-and-socket assembly (10) , comprising a body (44) having therein a multidiameter bore (46) , the multidiameter bore (46) comprising a flared entrance wall
(50) communicating with an open end (48) of the body (44) , a shoulder (52) defined by an end of the flared entrance wall (50) and a large diameter portion (54) of the bore
(46) , a small diameter portion (58) located axially interiorly of the bore (46) relative to the large diameter portion (54) , the small diameter and large diameter portions (58, 54) of the bore (46) connected by a frustoconical wall (56) extending radially outwardly in an axial direction corresponding to an axial direction of radial extension of the flared entrance wall (50) , a rod
(12) having a ball head (14) thereon, the ball head (14) including a groove (16) thereabout, and a flexible member (30) disposed within said groove (16) and extending radially outwardly therefrom and beyond the shoulder (52) , the flexible member (30) movable diametrically, relative to the ball head (14) , by engagement with the frustoconical wall (56) as the rod (12) is pivoted.
2. The ball-and-socket assembly in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the bore (46) comprises a blind bore (46) and the ball head (12) engages radially sloped surfaces (60) defining a bottom (62) of said bore (46) . 3. The ball-and-socket assembly in accordance with
Claim 2, wherein the rod (12) includes a large diameter portion (18) having a diameter slightly less than the diameter of the ball such that the large diameter portion of the rod and flared entrance wall (50) define a restricted limit of pivotal movement of the rod (12) .
4. The ball-and-socket assembly in accordance with Claim 3, wherein the ball head (14) is permanently captured within the bore (46) by means of the flexible member (30' being engagable with the shoulder (52) to prevent removal 


 of the ball head (14) from the bore .(46) when the rod (12) is moved axially away from the bore (46) .
5. The ball-and-socket assembly in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the large diameter portion (54) comprises a curved corner (64) located where the frustoconical wall (56) merges into a radially inward extending portion defining a radial side wall of the shoulder (52) .
6. A method of assembling the ball-and-socket « assembly in accordance with Claim 1, comprising the steps of displacing the flexible member (30) laterally into the groove (16) of the ball head (14) such that the flexible member (30) substantially surrounds a bottom (17) of the groove (16) and has a circumferential portion located partly in the groove (16) , inserting axially the ball head (14) into the bore (46) such that the flared entrance wall (50) compresses the flexible member (30) further into the groove (16) , and continuing to insert the ball head (14) axially into the bore (46) until the flexible member (30) passes axially the shoulder (52) and expands radially outwardly at the large diameter portion (54) of the bore (46) and thereby captures the ball head (14) within the bore (46) .
7. The method of Claim 6, wherein the flexible member (30) is free to move diametrically relative to the ball head (14) as the rod (12) is moved relative to the bore (46) .
