<ABSTRACT>
Elastomeric ethylene/propylene or ethylene/propylene/polyene 
copolymers containing small amounts of one or more α-olefins 

are prepared by a slurry process wherein the 
polymerization reaction is carried out in a mixture of liquid 

propylene and alpha-olefin. 
Problems due to fouling phenomena in the reactor are 
avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation
of ethylene-based copolymers and, more particulary, it
relates to a slurry process for the preparation of elastomeric
copolymers of ethylene.Among the ethylene-based elastomeric copolymers, only
ethylene-propylene (EPM) and ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM)
elastomers are produced on a commercial scale, at the date of
the present invention.The industrial production of EPM and EPDM elastomers is
currently carried out in the presence of Ziegler-Natta vanadium-based
catalysts, by solution or slurry processes.In the solution processes the comonomers are dissolved in
a solvent, generally hexane, in which the formed polymer is
soluble. In the slurry processes the reaction medium is
essentially constituted by liquid olefins and the polymer is
formed as a precipitate suspended in the liquid phase.A slurry process offers a number of advantages over a
solution process, namely:
no stirring viscosity problems;very homogeneous reaction medium;easier removal of the reaction heat;increased reactor throughput owing to higher concentration
of the polymer in the medium;higher polymerization yields;capability of producing very high MW polymers; energy savings for the recovery of the polymer;lower investment and production costs.However, a major problem of a slurry process arises from
the adhesive properties of the rubbery material. As a matter
of fact, the solid particles of the polymer have a tendency to
stick to one another or to the wall surface and to the agitating
element of the reactor. This worsens to a large extent the
diffusion of ethylene in the reaction medium and, what is
more, causes intensive fouling of the reactor, thus rendering
the preparation of the polymer very difficult.In order to avoid such problems, a solvent, such as
toluene or cyclohexane, can be added to the reaction medium,
which acts both as antifouling agent and as vehicle of the
catalyst system. The use of a low boiling diluent, such as
propane, has also been proposed. As a result, however, the
above indicated advantages of a slurry process are drastically
decreased.Another solution which has been proposed to render the
process in bulk possible, is the addition of antistatic agents
into the polymerization reactor. This solution, however, is
not completely satisfactory and, moreover, has the drawback of
introducing undesired compounds in the final product.Recently, processes have been disclosed for the preparation
of elastomeric ethylene-based copolymers in the presence
of
