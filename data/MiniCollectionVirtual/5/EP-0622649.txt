<ABSTRACT>
A coupler (1) made from optical fibres is provided with a tap for detecting the light which is guided at the coupler output in one of the fibres during operation. For this purpose, the coupler (1) which is embedded in a housing (2) has at the coupler output a lens body (8) which encloses the optical fibre (connection 6) and a detector (9) which is directed towards the lens body (8). During the operation of the coupler, lost light which is emitted by the lens body (8) via the primary coating of the optical fibre is received by said detector and is passed by the detector (9) to an electrical evaluation system.
