<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL SWITCHES AND DETECTORS UTILIZING INDIRECT NARROW-GAP SUPERLATTICES AS THE OPTICAL MATERIALField of the InventionThe invention relates to novel optical devices operating in the infrared (IR), based on indirect narrow-gap superlattices (INGS) as the active optical materials. The INGS are a new type of semiconductor material that is fabricated by using semimetal/semiconductor multilayers.The novel optical devices include (1) wideband all-optical switches, which combine small insertion loss at low light intensities with efficient optical switching and optical limiting at high intensities, and (2) wideband infrared detectors with high collection efficiency and low tunneling noise currents, suitable for use in longwave infrared (LWIR) focal plane arrays.Background of the Invention Wideband optical switches are needed in several IR technologies, for example optical communications, image processing and countermeasures. The requirements for such wideband optical switches include low insertion loss, low threshold for switching, large dynamic range, high threshold for switch damage, and operation at a wide range of pulse length (subnanoseconds to seconds).In the prior art, the best attempts at partially satisfying optical switch requirements at C02 wavelengths have involved using switches based on induced opaqueness. These have employed materials which undergo a thermally-induced phase transition, for example V02, or materials which display thermal runaway, for example chalcogenide glasses. However, since excess energy is absorbed by the switch itself in these prior art devices, heat dissipation has been a significant problem. Switch heating and damage ultimately limit the performance at long pulses of these prior art devices. Furthermore, a thermal bias, typically 60-120° C, is generally required, which in IR sensor systems has the undesired effect of increasing the thermal background.Induced scattering, self-focusing, self-defocusing, and total internal 

reflection have also been suggested as mechanisms which could yield wideband optical switching. However, whereas theoretical models predict that switching should be achievable using these approaches, a lack of IR materials with suitable properties has prevented the development of practical devices. Switch operation using any of these mechanisms at C02 wavelengths has previously been demonstrated only in narrow regimes. The requirements for the materials suitable for these mechanisms include a strong optical nonlinearity, nonlinear response to both
