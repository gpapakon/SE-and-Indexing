<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safety device 
for a vehicle antitheft system, particularly for cars 
featuring an electronic engine control system. Systems of the aforementioned type currently 
installed on motor vehicles are known to comprise an 
electronic control system for enabling operation of the 
engine on receiving a user code; an antitheft device for 
receiving the user code and transmitting it to the 
control system; and a user code transmitter carried by 
the user. Failing reception of the correct user code, 
the control system prevents the engine from being 
started. A major drawback of the above system is the 
impossibility of rapidly starting the engine in the 
event of a fault in the electrical supply to the control 
system. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a safety device for a vehicle antitheft system, 
enabling rapid startup of the engine even in the event 
of abnormal turn-off of the engine due to a fault in the  
 
electrical supply to the control system. Further aims and advantages of the present 
invention will be disclosed in the following 
description. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a safety device for a vehicle antitheft system, 
particularly for vehicles featuring an electronic engine 
control system; characterized in that it comprises means 
for detecting abnormal turn-off of the engine; and means 
permitting startup of the engine a limited number of 
times in the event of abnormal turn-off of the engine. A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the 
present invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an antitheft 
system in accordance with the teachings of the present 
invention; Figure 2 shows an operational flow chart of the 
Figure 1 system. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a vehicle antitheft 
system, particularly for motor vehicles. System 1 comprises:
 
   an electronic control system 2 for enabling 
operation of the engine on receiving a user code "A", a 
fitter code "B", or a maker code "C";
 
   an on-vehicle antitheft device 3 presenting a 
signal receiver connected to control system 2;
 
   a code "A" transmitter 4 for the user;
 
 
   a code "B" transmitter 5 for the fitter of system 
1 to the vehicle;
 
   a device 6 for the maker of control system 2, and 
connectable to control system 2 for transmitting code 
"C"; and
 
   a display 7 connected to control system 2 and 
fitted to the vehicle dashpanel. Transmitters 4 and 5 may
