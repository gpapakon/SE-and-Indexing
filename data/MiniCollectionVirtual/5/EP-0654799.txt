Resistor of SMD construction with at least one 
resistive layer forming a resistive track (15), 

particularly a film of a resistive alloy, and with at 
least two metallic contact elements which are 

electrically conductively connected to the resistive 
track (15) and are electrically insulated from one 

another and which have connector surfaces (19) lying in 
a plane at least approximately parallel to the resistive 

track (15) with which the resistor may be soldered flat 
to terminals on a printed circuit board, characterised in 

that the contact elements are constructed as carrier 
plate elements (10A,10B) of thermally conductive metal on 

whose surfaces opposed to the connector surfaces (19) the 
resistive track (15) is arranged. 
Resistor as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that disposed between the metallic carrier plate elements 

(10A,10B) and the resistive track (15) there is an 
insulating layer (18) at whose edges a metallic layer 

(16) is provided which connects the resistive track (15) 
to the carrier plate elements (10A,10B). 
Resistor as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the two carrier plate elements (10A,10B) are 

rigidly connected together by a mechanically stable 
insulating material which fills a gap (11) which extends 

between the two connecting surfaces (19) and electrically 
insulates the two carrier plate elements (10A,10B) 

from one another. 
Resistor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the carrier plate elements  

 
(10A,10B) comprise pieces of copper plate. 
Resistor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the carrier plate elements 

(10A,10B) are tin plated at least on their connector 
surfaces. 
Resistor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the insulating layer (18) comprises 

a good thermally conductive adhesive film. 
Method of manufacturing resistors as claimed in one 
of the preceding claims in which a film (15') of a 

resistive alloy is secured to a carrier plate (10') of 
thermally conductive metal and in which resistive tracks 

are formed by the selective removal of parts of the film 
(15'), characterised in that the carrier plate (10') is 

electrically connected to parts of the resistive film 
(15') and is split into individual contact elements 

(10A,10B), each of which is electrically connected to an 
end of a resistive track (15). 
Method as claimed in claim 7, characterised by the 
following method steps: 


(a) a pattern of elongate holes or rows of elongate 
holes (22) parallel to one another is produced in a 

composite film comprising a resistive film (15') and an 

adhesive film (18'); 
(b) the composite film is laminated onto a metallic 
plate (10'); 
(c) the resistive film (15') is photolithographically 
structured and etched to produce a plurality of 

individual resistive tracks (15) and thereafter covered 
by a protective layer (20), edge regions (24) of the  

 
resistive tracks and surface regions of the metal plate 

(10') in the elongate holes (22) being left free; 
(d) the regions left free of the protective layer (20) 
are metallised to electrically connect the resistive 

tracks (15) to the metal plate (10'); 
(e) the parts of the metal plate (10') which are 
connected to the two edge regions (24) of a resistive 

track (15) are separated from one another by forming a 
continuous gap (11) extending parallel to the elongate 

holes (22) to the adhesive film (18'), a respective plate 
element (10A,10B) remaining on the two sides of the gap 

(11) ; 
(f) the laminate constituted by the composite film and 
the metal plate (10') is split into the individual 

resistors along the length of the elongate holes (22) 
whilst splitting the metallic layers (16) situated 

therein and transversely thereto along the length of the 
edges of the resistive tracks (15). 
Method as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that 
the gaps (11) in the metal plate (10') are filled with a 

mechanically stabilising plastics material. 
Method as claimed in Claim 8 or 9, characterised in 
that the gaps (11) in the metal plate (10') are produced 

by etching. 
Method as claimed in one of Claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that the electrical connection between 

the resistive tracks (15) and the contact elements is 
effected by galvanic metallizing. 
Method as claimed in one of Claims 7 to 11, 
characterised in that a pattern comprising a plurality of  

 
resistive tracks arranged in columns and lines 

perpendicular to one another is produced on the carrier 
plate. 
Use of a resistor as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims on a printed circuit board which has two 

connecting surfaces (32) on conductive terminals (30, 31) 
arranged in a manner corresponding to the connector 

surfaces (19) on the carrier plate elements (10A, 10B) 
and two additional voltage connector leads (34) leading 

away from the connector surfaces (32) of the printed 
circuit board to form four-pole terminations. 
Use as claimed in Claim 13, characterised in that 
the voltage connector leads (34) are connected in the gap 

between the connector surfaces (32) of the printed 
circuit board to the centre thereof.
