<CLAIMS>
Housing for the ballistic protection of persons and/or 
articles, having plates (1) as housing walls which are 

connected to one another by section rails (2), the 
section rails (2) having at least one channel (5) which 

encloses in each case one plate edge and into which said 
plate is inserted, characterized in that the plates are 

compound plates and are compressible at least in the 
region used for insertion into the section rails (2), 

that the channel(s) (5) towards the outside of the 
housing has (have) a smooth wall (5b) and towards the 

inside of the housing has (have) a wall (5a) with an 
undulating or serrated contour, and that the plates are 

inserted with simultaneous compression of the edge region 
with the aid of wedges (3, 4, 6, 7) into the channel(s) 

(5) of the section rails (2), the wedges (3, 4, 6, 7) at 
least at the side facing the channel wall having a 

contour corresponding to the channel wall and said wedges 
(3, 4, 6, 7) being driven home in the space between the 

inner-lying channel wall (5a) and the inner-lying plate 
edge. 
Housing according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
plates are made of a fibre composite material. 
Housing according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the wedges (3, 4, 6, 7) have an undulating or serrated 

contour on both sides. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the wedges have an angle of between 

5° and 15°. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the section rail (2) has at least 

one U-shaped channel.  
 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the section rail (2) has at least 

one V-shaped channel. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the section rail (2) has at least 

one L-shaped groove, to the shorter limb of which a 
support (8) is connected, the support together with the 

L-shaped groove forming the channel which encloses the 
compressible part of the plate. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the section rails (2) and/or wedges 

(3, 4, 6, 7) and/or support (8) are made of a hard, 
pressure- and creep-resistant material. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the section rails (2) and/or wedges 

(3, 4, 6, 7) and/or support (8) are made at least 
predominantly of steel. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the section rails (2) and/or wedges 

(3, 4, 6, 7) and/or support (8) are made at least 
predominantly of a metal-coated ceramic material. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the wedges (3, 4, 6, 7) are made at 

least predominantly of a ceramic material. 
Housing according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the compressibility of the plates 

(1), at least in the region of the plate edge, is between 
0.5 and 5%.
