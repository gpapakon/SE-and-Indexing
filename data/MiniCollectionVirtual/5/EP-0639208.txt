<ABSTRACT>
The mechanical properties of cured perfluoroelastomers are enhanced by incorporating into compounds of uncured perfluoropolymer a fluoropolymer containing a hydroxyl group. The modified fluoropolymer can be either a fluoroplastic or a fluoroelastomer. A preferred hydroxy-containing monomer for preparation of the fluoropolymer is CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)OCF2CF2-CH2OH.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PERFLUOROELASTOMERS WITH ENHANCED PROPERÎ—ESBackground of the InventionPerfluoroelastomers such as those described hi U.S. Patents 3,682,872, 4,281,092, 4,487,903 and 4,983,697 have properties- that make them attractive for use under unusually severe conditions. These materials are suitable for applications requiring the characteristics of an elastomer and at the same time tolerance for exposure to high temperatures or to aggressive chemicals. The mechanical properties of perfluoroelastomers, in common with other elastomers, are conventionally adjusted by varying the ratios of perfluoromonomers in the polymers, by varying the amount of carbon black and other compound ingredients, and by varying the curing, or vulcanizing, chemistry. Certain uses, however, require combinations of properties not attainable by known means. One particularly desirable improvement would be the increase of tensile strength and modulus without sacrifice of compression set.Summary of the Invention The present invention provides cured perfluoroelastomers which exhibit enhanced mechanical properties through the incorporation into the compound of a fluoropolymer modified with a monomer containing a hydroxyl group.Specifically, the instant invention provides a polymer blend comprising, complementally, (a) at least one perfluoroelastomer of tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroalkyl perfluoro(vinyl ether) and at least one cure site moiety, and(b) about from 2 to 20 parts by weight of at least one hydroxy-containing fluoropolymer, the fluoropolymer containing about from 0.2 to 20 mole percent of units derived from at least one hydroxy-containing vinyl ether monomer of the formulaCF2=CF[OCF2CF(CF3)]n(0)p(CF2)mCH2OH wherein p is 0 or 1; m is 0 to 10 and n is 0 to 20; and provided that when m is 0, p is 0; and when m is greater than 0, p is 1; and further provided that at least one of n and m is at least 1. 

 Detailed Description of the InventionPerfluoroelastomers used in the present invention are prepared from tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroalkyl perfluoro(vinyl ether) and at least one cure site moiety. For purposes of the present invention, minor portions of the tetrafluoroethylene can be replaced by other perhaloolefins, such as chlorotrifluoroethylene. Perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ethers) preferred for use in the present invention include perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) (PMVE) and perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (PPVE). Small concentrations of monomers which are not perfluorinated can also be used without significantly changing the desirable
