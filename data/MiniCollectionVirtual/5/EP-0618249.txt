<ABSTRACT>
A preparation process of aliphatic polyester having a weight average 
molecular weight of 15,000 or more by conducting a direct 

polycondensation reaction of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or a mixed 
aliphatic polyhydric alcohol and an aliphatic polybasic acid or a mixed 

aliphatic polybasic acid, or additionally a hydroxycarboxylic acid or a 
mixed hydroxycarboxylic acid or an oligomer of the hydroxycarboxylic 

acid in a reaction mixture containing an organic solvent. 
The aliphatic polyester thus obtained contains an extremely small 
amount of impurities, has low color and can exhibit satisfactory 

strength in the form of films, filaments and other shaped articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing aliphatic
polyester which is a biodegradable polycondensate and is useful as a
medical material and a substitute of general purpose resin by direct
polycondensation of a mixture of polyhydric alcohols with polybasic
acids or a blend of said mixture with hydroxycarboxylic acids, and to
the aliphatic polyester prepared by said process.Aliphatic polyester can be hydrolyzed with relative ease in the
presence of water and also decomposed by microorganisms.Aliphatic polyester can also be hydrolyzed and absorbed in a living
body and thus has been focused attention as a polycondensate which can
be applied to the above uses.As widely known, processes for preparing high molecular weight
polyester from polyhydric alcohols and polybasic acids are based upon a
deglycolation reaction of low molecular weight polyester having
terminal hydroxyl groups.Consequently, concentration of the terminal group is drastically
lowered with increase in the molecular weight. A decomposition
reaction due to the concentration of the ester at the ester exchange
step is also added and thus restriction is found on the molecular weight
increase. The tendency is particularly dominant in aliphatic
polyester. For example, it has been found that the molecular weight
attains a maximum value and successively starts to decrease in the
preparation of high molecular weight saturated polyester by a 
conventional deglycolation reaction under reduced pressure.In such cases, it is difficult so far as depending upon the
conventional deglycolation reaction to prepare aliphatic polyester
having a molecular weight which is satisfactory to form a tough film.
In other words, the molecular weight obtained in the aliphatic polyester
was low so that it was unable to form a film having characteristics for
practical use.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication HEI 4-189822 and 4-189823
describe preparation processes of high molecular weight polyester
comprising adding, in the molten state above the melting point, an
isocyanate compound having from 0.1 to 2 equivalents of an isocyanate
group for an existing hydroxyl group to saturated polyester which has a
number average molecular weight of 5,000 or more, a terminal group
substantially consisting of the hydroxyl group and an acid component
composed of a compound having 5 or more carbon atoms or a mixture of
the compound.Japanese Laid-Open Patent HEI 5-310898 has described a preparation
process of high molecular weight aliphatic polyester comprising
