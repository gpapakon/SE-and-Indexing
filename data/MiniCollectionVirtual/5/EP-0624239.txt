<ABSTRACT>
An elongated configured spring (28) which biases the trigger bar (21) of a pistol (10) rearwardly and upwardly and engages the slide stop latch (17) to prevent its transverse movement. The spring (28) is anchored in the frame (11) and trigger bar (21) under tension. The spring (28) is long and narrow requiring little space in the firearm.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pistols having trigger bars have been biased with
a plunger spring arrangement (U.S. Patent No.
4,575,963). Further, slide stop latches have included
slots with retention springs engageable therein (U. S.
Patent No. 4,627,184).From US-A-4 428 138 there is known an automatic pistol
according to the preamble part of claim 1. In particular,
this document discloses a construction in which a spring
element with a forward end section thereof engages a frame
of the pistol and with a rearward end section thereof
engages a trigger bar in order to bias same. There is no
further interaction between the spring element and another
component of the pistol.DE-OS-25 17 002 discloses a pistol in which a substantially
V-shaped spring element with one end portion thereof
engages a pistol frame and with another end portion thereof
engages a trigger bar in order to bias same. Again there is
no interaction of the spring element with a further
component of the pistol.It is the object of the present invention to provide an
automatic pistol having a reduced number of components
thereby reducing the manufacturing steps and costs.According to the present invention this object is solved by
the automatic pistol as defined in claim 1. Broadly, the present invention comprises an
elongated configured spring which biases the trigger
bar of a pistol having a frame and a slide rearwardly
and upwardly and engages grooved slide stop latch to
prevent its transverse movement, and to bias the slide
stop pin shaft to cause the slide stop to remain
against or near the frame during pistol operation.It is a feature of the invention that the spring
element functions to both bias the trigger bar and to
bias and control movement of the slide stop latch.Fig. 1 is a partial side elevational view of the
automatic pistol of the present invention;Fig. 2 is a partial enlarged sectional
elevational view along lines 2-2 of Fig. 4 showing
frame, slide, trigger bar, stop latch and elongated
spring with trigger at rest;Fig. 2a is a sectional view taken along line 2a-2a
of Fig. 2; Fig. 3 is a sectional view along line 3-3 of Fig.
2;Fig. 4 is a plan view of the pistol with portion
cutaway showing the elongated spring and related
parts; andFig. 5 is a view similar to Fig. 2 in which the
pistol trigger is in its pulled position.Fig. 6 is an elevational view of an alternative
elongated spring including a full circle loop;Fig. 7 is a top view of the spring of Fig. 6;Fig. 8 is a partial elevational view of the rear

<CLAIMS>
An automatic pistol (10), comprising a frame (11), a
trigger (14), a trigger bar (21; 21') connected to the

trigger (14), said trigger bar being movable forwardly
and rearwardly relative to the frame (11) during

operation, a slide (13), a slide stop latch (17) for
limiting movement of the slide (13), an elongated spring element

(18; 40) for biasing the trigger bar (21; 21'), said
spring element (28; 40) comprising


a forward end section (28a; 40a), said forward
end section (28a; 40a) being positioned in the

frame (11),
a rearward end section (28c; 40h), said rearward
end section (28c; 40h) being positioned in the

trigger bar (21; 21'),
a middle section (28b; 40b),

said pistol further comprising first spring mount
means (26, 21a; 41) on the trigger bar (21; 21') for

confining the rearward end of the spring element (28;
40) to urge the rearward end section (28c; 40h) into

and against the trigger bar (21; 21'), second spring
mount means (lla) on the frame (11) for securing the

spring element (28; 40) to the frame (11),

characterized by slot means (20) in the slide stop
latch (17) for engaging the forward end section (28a;

40a) of the spring element (28; 14) to prevent
transverse movement of such latch. 
The automatic pistol of claim 1 in which the first
spring mount means (26) is a trigger bar hole (21a) and bracket

means (26) on the trigger bar (21) which bracket means (26) hold the
elongated spring (28) in the trigger bar hole (21a) under

tension.
The automatic pistol of claim 1 in which the second
mount means (11a) is a hole in the frame (11) and the stop latch (17) 

which stop latch (17) hold the elongated spring (28) in such
frame hole (11a) under tension.
The automatic pistol of claim 1 in which the slot
means (20) has a seat means (20c) and in which the elongated

spring element (28;40) may engage such seat (20c) to rotatably bias
the stop latch (17).
The automatic pistol of claim 1 in which the
rearward end section (40h) includes a partial curved portion

and in which the first spring mount means (41) is a cavity
in the trigger bar (21').
The automatic pistol of claim 1 in which spring
element middle section (40b) is a full circle loop (40l).
