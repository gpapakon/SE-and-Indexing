<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle air suspension can be controlled between a Standard setting of ride height and a lower, Kneel, setting. Movement to or from the Kneel setting is frozen if a door is opened or if the footbrake is applied. Alteration to the Kneel setting is prevented except when the vehicle is stationary. The suspension reverts to the Standard ride height if the vehicle is driven off or the handbrake is released. Movement of the suspension to or from a lower or higher setting is carried out sequentially to prevent headlamp dazzle. If the vehicle becomes partly supported by direct contact between the chassis and the ground (belly-out) this is detected by monitoring signals to ride height control valves and by providing a controlled re-inflation and balancing of the air springs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to suspension systems for 
vehicles. In particular it relates to a suspension system 
for a vehicle having front wheels and rear wheels, the 
suspension system being of the kind which comprises front 
suspension units for supporting vehicle weight on the front 
wheels and rear suspension units for supporting vehicle 
weight on the rear wheels, the suspension units being 
operative to adjust the ride height between sprung and 
unsprung parts of the vehicle, and control means operatively 
connected to the suspension units for maintaining the ride 
height at a particular setting. Suspension systems of the kind referred to commonly 
use air or gas as the suspension medium with air or liquid 
being admitted to or released from the suspension units to 
provide the adjustment of ride height. Whilst it is known, for example from WO91/06440, to 
provide control means for manually selecting a ride height 
in a suspension system of the kind referred to, this prior 
art specification, along with others, is mostly concerned 
with the provision of such control means in goods carrying 
vehicles. Other prior art, for example GB-A-1551769, is 
mainly concerned with large passenger carrying vehicles such 
as omnibuses.  
 In JP-A-61036007 a vehicle, described as a car, has a 
suspension system of the kind referred to in which the 
vehicle can be moved to a Kneel position by operation of a 
valve, movement to the Kneel setting being interrupted if 
the vehicle contacts an object. In WO-A-93/05970, which is 
prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC only, there is 
described a suspension system of the kind referred to in 
which a driver operable selector means can provide a 
driver's selector signal to cause the control means to 
alter the ride height from a Standard setting for normal 
driving on a road to a lower, Kneel setting, movement to 
the Kneel setting being interrupted if a door of the 
vehicle is opened. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
suspension system which is particularly suitable for 
smaller passenger carrying vehicles such as automobiles and 
sports utility vehicles. According to the invention there is 
provided a suspension system of the kind referred to 
wherein the control means is operative to maintain the ride 
height at a first, Standard, setting for normal driving on 
a road and comprising driver operable selector means for 
varying operation of the control means to alter the ride 
height to a second, Kneel, setting below the Standard 
setting, wherein the
