<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a projection type 
color liquid crystal optical apparatus comprising a light 
source system for projecting light, color separating and 
synthesizing dichroic mirrors, three reflection type 
liquid crystal optical elements and a projection lens as 
its constituent elements. In recent years, a transparent/scattering type liquid 
crystal optical element in which a liquid crystal and 
solidified matrix composite is held wherein a nematic 
liquid crystal is dispersed and and held in a solidified 
matrix, and the refractive index of the solidified matrix 
is made substantially coincident with the refractive 
index of the liquid crystal used in either state of 
application or non-application of a voltage, has been 
noted. The transparent/scattering type liquid crystal 
optical element has an advantage enabling a bright 
display because no polarization plate is used. 
Therefore, the optical element is gathering an attention  
 
when it is, in particular, used for a projection type 
optical apparatus because a bright projection picture 
image is obtainable. When the transparent/scattering type liquid crystal 
optical element is used as a reflection type element 
wherein a light reflection layer is formed on a surface 
of the element, light is reciprocated in a layer of a 
light modulating material so that there is obtainable a 
working length twice as large as a case of using the 
optical element as a transmission type element, whereby 
it can be used as an element having a high scattering 
ability in a scattering stage. Accordingly, when the transparent/scattering type 
liquid crystal optical element is used for the reflection 
type optical apparatus, there is a clear difference 
between a transparent state and a scattering state, and a 
high contrast display becomes possible in comparison with 
a case of the transmission type optical apparatus. Further, a projection type color liquid crystal 
optical apparatus wherein the transparent/scattering type 
liquid crystal optical element is used as a reflection 
type element, in particular, a projection type color 
liquid crystal optical apparatus wherein light from a 
white light source is subjected to color-separation into 
three colors: blue (B), green (G) and red (R), and each 
of the color lights is modulated with use of three 
reflection type liquid crystal optical elements, is  
 
useful because full color projection becomes possible by 
regulating light scattering properties of the reflection 
type liquid crystal optical
