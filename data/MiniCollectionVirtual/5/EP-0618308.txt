<ABSTRACT>
To an electroless gold plating bath 
comprising a water-soluble gold compound, a 

complexing agent, and a reducing agent is added 
a non-ionic surfactant or non-ionic polymer as 

a stabilizer. The bath allows a satisfactory 
gold plating film to be formed on metal portions 

on a ceramic substrate as in ceramic IC package 
without plating spread.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electroless
or chemical gold plating bath and more
particularly, to an electroless gold plating
bath comprising a water-soluble gold compound,
a complexing agent, a reducing agent, and a
stabilizer for minimizing plating spread.For utilizing the advantages of gold
including its physical properties such as
electric conduction and thermal bonding ability
and its chemical properties such as oxidation
resistance and chemical resistance, electroless
gold plating has heretofore been applied to
terminals and circuit surfaces of electronic
industry parts including printed circuit boards,
ceramic IC packages, ITO substrates, and IC
cards.Conventional electroless gold plating
baths, however, tend to incur plating spread in 
that a coating also deposits at non-intended
places, causing stains or blur, especially in
the case of plating on metal portions formed on
a ceramic base. The plating spread is a serious
problem particularly when it is desired to
effect electroless gold plating on ceramic IC
packages.Therefore, an object of the present
invention is to provide an electroless gold
plating bath which when applied to a ceramic
base having metal portions thereon, can form a
satisfactory gold coating only on the metal
portions without incurring plating spread and is
thus suited for gold plating of ceramic IC
packages or the like.Regarding an electroless or chemical
plating bath comprising a water-soluble gold
compound, a complexing agent, and a reducing
agent, the inventors have found that by adding a
non-ionic surfactant or a non-ionic polymer
such as polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene
glycol type surfactants, polyvinyl alcohol, and
polyvinyl pyrrolidone as a plating stabilizer to 
the bath, an aesthetically acceptable gold
plating film free of stain or blur can be
deposited on metal portions on a ceramic base
without incurring plating spread.The present invention provides an
electroless gold plating bath comprising a
water-soluble gold compound, a complexing
agent, a reducing agent, and a stabilizer in the
form of a non-ionic surfactant or a non-ionic
polymer.The present invention also provides a
method of electroless gold plating a metal
portion on a ceramic base wherein the ceramic
base is immersed in the above-defined
electroless gold plating bath thereby the gold
coating is deposited only on the metal portion.A water-soluble gold compound is
contained as a gold source in the electroless
gold plating bath of the invention. It is any
of gold compounds which can provide monovalent
and
