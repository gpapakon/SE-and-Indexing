<ABSTRACT>
The invention allows page mode memory access in a single clock 
memory. A control signal PAGE, one level of which designates an ordinary 

mode and the other level of which designates a page mode, is provided to 
a single clock memory 10 from the outside. A mode state identification 

circuit 14 identifies four mode states; ordinary mode, page-in, 
during-page, and page-out by decoding the combination of the control 

signal levels in two consecutive memory cycles, thereby controlling a 
memory control circuit part 18 of a memory array 16 based on the result 

of the identification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a single clock memory that can 
execute a page mode. There are two types of memories; single clock memory and double 
clock memory. The single clock memory is a memory which takes in both 
row and column addresses in response to a single clock signal. Figure 8 
shows a typical circuit configuration of this type of dynamic random 
access memory (DRAM). In the single clock memory shown in Figure 8, row 
address A0 through A10 and column address A11 through A21 are applied to 
their respective address input terminals and loaded simultaneously into a 
row address buffer and a column address buffer by a single clock signal 
-CE (negative polarity signal of CE). On the other hand, the double clock memory is a memory which takes 
in both row and column addresses at different times using address 
multiplexing. Figure 9 shows a typical circuit configuration of a double 
clock memory DRAM. In the memory shown in Figure 9, row and column 
addresses are applied sequentially to the same address input terminals A0 
through A10, the row address being loaded into a row address buffer by 
row address strobe signal -RAS (negative polarity signal of RAS), the 
column address being loaded into a column address buffer by a column 
address strobe signal -CAS (negative polarity signal of CAS). When -RAS is active (low level), the double clock DRAM latches 
(holds) the row address and the sense amplifier of the memory cell array 
latches data, which allows data access called page mode to be implemented 
in the double clock DRAM. The page mode is a mode of accessing 
individual memory cells by fixing one row address provided to the DRAM, 
and then continuously providing different column addresses to the DRAM. The single clock DRAM makes it a condition that row and column 
addresses are generated simultaneously and the row circuits (such as the 
sense amplifier) and the column circuits are controlled by a single 
external clock. Consequently, terminating an access to a memory cell  
 
resets the row and column addresses latched in the memory. As a result, 
there exists a problem that the single clock DRAM cannot implement the 
page mode that is allowed with the double clock DRAM. In addition, there emerges another problem that even if the single 
clock DRAM is given the row address holding function and data holding 
function, the page mode cannot be immediately performed. The page mode 
and the ordinary mode differ from each other in the control process 
within the memory. The page mode requires

1 A single clock memory (10) which takes in row and column addresses 
in response to a single external clock in ordinary mode, 

comprising: 
input means (12) for receiving an external control 
signal capable 
of representing the states of start of page mode, during-page mode, 

and end of page mode; 
identification means (14) connected to said input means for 

identifying the mode state represented by said control signal; and 
memory control means (18) for executing a predetermined memory 

control process in correspondence with the state identified by said 
identification means. 
2 A single clock memory (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said input 
means (12) is a single control input line for receiving the control 

signal whose first level indicates said ordinary mode and whose 
second level indicates said page mode, and 

wherein said identification means includes first detection means 
(L2) for detecting the level of said control signal in the 

preceding memory cycle, second detection means (L1) for detecting 
the level of said control signal in the current memory cycle, and

detection means (L2) comprises a first latch for receiving said 

control signal and said clock signal, said second detection means 
(L1) comprises a second latch for receiving the output of said 

first latch and said clock signal, and said decode means (32, 34, 
36, 38) comprises a plurality of logic gates for receiving the 

outputs of said first and said second latches.

control means (18) operates to selectively omit part of the memory 

control operations which are usually performed in said ordinary 
 

mode, depending on the mode states of start of page mode, during-page 
mode, and end of page mode.
