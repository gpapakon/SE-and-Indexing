represent hydrogen; and 


Y =
fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, methyl sulphate, 
fluorosulphonate, phosphate, tetrafluoroborate or tosylate. 
Process for assaying according to claim 1 reduced 
glutathione (GSH) in an aqueous sample, especially a biological sample, 

characterized in that it essentially comprises the steps consisting of : 

1. forming a chromophoric substitution product between all the 
mercaptans present in the sample and a reagent chosen from the 

compounds of general formula I defined in Claim 1; and  
 
2. bringing the pH of the reaction medium to a value between 12.8 and 
13.8, in order to form specifically a chromophoric thione from the 

chromophoric substitution product formed in step 1. between GSH and 
the said reagent. 
Process for assaying according to claim 1 total mercaptans 
in an aqueous sample, especially a biological sample, characterized in that 

it comprises essentially the steps consisting of: 

1. adding to the sample to be assayed, buffered within the pH range of 7.0 
to 7.5, an aliquot of a stock solution, in water or a water-miscible 

solvent, of a BXT reagent of general formula I in excess, 
2. homogenizing the reaction medium thus obtained, 
3. leaving to incubate for at least 5 minutes, 
4. measuring, by means of a spectrophotometer, the absorbance of the 
substitution product(s) or adduct(s) formed between the BXT reagent 

and the mercaptan(s) present in the sample and 
5. determining the concentration, in moles/litre of total mercaptans present 
in the sample, according to the formula : 


[total mercaptans] = (A/εm × d) × D 
 
in which: 


A represents the absorbance measured, 
εm represents the specific molar extinction coefficient for the BXT 
reagent used, expressed in l.mole

d represents the cuvette length, expressed in cm, and 
D represents the coefficient of dilution. 
Process for assaying according to claim 1 reduced 
glutathione, GSH, in an aqueous sample, especially a biological sample, 

characterized in that it comprises essentially the steps consisting of: 

1. adding to the sample to be assayed, buffered within the pH range of 7.0 
to 7.5, an aliquot of a stock solution, in water or in a water-miscible 

solvent, of a BXT reagent of general formula I in excess, 
2. homogenizing the reaction medium thus obtained, 
3. leaving to incubate for at least 5 minutes, 
4. adjusting the pH of the mixture to a value of between 12.8 and 13.8, 
according to the BXT reagent chosen, 
5. leaving to incubate for at least 15 minutes,  
 
6. measuring, by means of a spectrophotometer, the absorbance of the 
chromophoric thione produced by β-elimination, specifically with the 

adduct GSH-BXT reagent and 
7. determining the concentration in moles/litre of GSH in the sample,

of mercaptans distinct from glutathione in an aqueous sample, especially a 

biological sample, by subtracting the concentrations measured according to 

the processes of Claims 3 and 4 respectively, using the formula:
