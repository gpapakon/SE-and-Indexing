<ABSTRACT>
A transgene for producing recombinant polypeptides in the milk of transgenic bovine species comprises at least one expression regulation sequence, a secretory DNA sequence encoding a secretory signal sequence which is functional in mammary secretory cells of the bovine species and a recombinant DNA sequence encoding the recombinant polypeptide. Also included are methods for producing transgenic bovine species. The method includes introducing the above transgene into an embryonal target cell of a bovine species, transplanting the trangenic embryonic target cell formed thereby into a recipient bovine parent and indentifying at least one female offspring which is capable of producing the recombinant polypeptide in its milk. The invention also includes transgenic bovine species as well as the milk from such transgenic bovine species. Methods are also provided for producing transgenic non-human mammals having a desirable phenotype. The method comprises first methylating a transgene followed by introduction into fertilized oocytes. The oocytes are then cultured to form pre-implantation embryons. Thereafter, at least one cell is removed from each of the pre-implantation embryons and the DNA digested with a restriction endonuclease capable of cleaving the methylated transgene but incapable of cleaving the unmethylated form of the transgene.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PRODUCTION OF RECOMBINANT POLYPEPTIDES BY BOVINE SPECIES AND TRANSGENIC METHODSField of the InventionThe invention relates to the production of recombinant polypeptides by transgenic bovine species and to methods for producing transgenic non-human mammals having a desired phenotype.Background of the InventionThere is a plethora of literature relating to the expression of heterologous genes in lower organisms such as unicellular bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi, and in higher cell types such as mammalian cells. There are also numerous reports on the production of transgenic animals, most of which relate to the production of transgenic mice. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,866 (transgenic mice containing activated oncogene) ; Andres, A., et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8_4-' 1299-1303 (HA-RAS oncogene under control of whey acid protein promoter) ; Schoenberger, CA. , et al. 

(1987) Experientia 43:644 and (1988) EMBO J. 7: 169-175 (C-myc oncogene under control of whey acid protein promoter) ; and Muller, W.J., et al. (1988) Cell 54 : 105- 115 (C-myc oncogene under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter) . Several laboratories have also reported the production of transgenic porcine species (Miller, K.F., et al. (1989) J. Endocrin. 120:481-488 (expression of human or bovine growth hormone gene in transgenic swine) ; Vize, P.D., et al. (1988) J. Cell Sci. 9.0-295-300 (porcine growth hormone fusion gene in transgenic pigs) ; and Ebert, K. et al. (1988) Mol. Endocrin. 2 : 277-283 (MMLV-rat so atotropin fusion gene in transgenic pigs) ) , transgenic sheep (Nancarrow, et al. (1987) Theriogenology 2J7:263 (transgenic sheep containing bovine growth hormone gene) Clark, A.J. et al. (1989) Bio/Technology 7:487-482 and Simons, J., et al. (1988) Bio/Technology 6: 179-183 (human factor IX and α-1 antitrypsin CONA in ovine species) , and rabbit (Hanover, S.V., et al. (1987) Deutche Tierarztliche Wochenschrift 9 _, : 476-478 (production of transgenic ' rabbits by injection of uteroglobin-promoter-CAT fusion gene into fertilized rabbit oocytes) . A number of reports have also suggested the production of transgenic cattle (Wagner, et al. (1984) Theriogenology 21:29-44) with one reporting some progress in microinjection techniques (Lohse, J.K., et al. (1985) Theriogenology 2_3:205) . However, little, if any, success has been achieved in producing transgenic cows. Scientific articles which clearly demonstrate the actual production of a transgenic cow capable of producing a heterologous protein are
