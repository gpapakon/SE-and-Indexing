<ABSTRACT>
A printer is provided with a small scanner located upstream 
along a paper path from a printing device such as a 

print head. A form is loaded into the printer and is 
advanced incrementally along the paper path. A segment of 

the form is scanned by the scanner (rectangle 53). The scanned segment 
is displayed on a user interface (rectangle 57). A user may provide 

information in selected blank spaces of the displayed 
segment with a keyboard (rectangle 59). The user may then command the 

printer to print (rectangle 61), wherein the information is printed in 
the selected blank spaces of the segment by the print 

head. The next segment of the form is scanned (rectangle 69) and 
displayed to the user (rectangle 71).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses 
for filling in forms on a data processing system. One application of data processing systems is word processing, 
wherein documents with text and even graphics can 
be created, stored and modified electronically. A printer 
is utilized to obtain a copy of the document on paper. One common requirement in office environments is the 
filling in of forms. Before word processing with data 
processing systems, forms were filled in using typewriters. 
Because word processing offers so many advantages 
over typewriters, it is desirable to provide the capability 
of filling in forms using a word processing system. 
However, the prior art methods of filling in forms with 
word processing systems are too expensive or too clumsy. 
Therefore, many offices equipped with word processing 
systems continue to use typewriters to fill in forms. One prior art method of filling in forms involves 
manually creating the form on the word processing system. 
An operator duplicates or creates the form. This is a 
time consuming process and becomes too expensive if there 
are many different forms that need to be implemented on 
the word processing system. Furthermore, this method is 
not practical for one-of-a-kind forms. These types of IBM 
forms are generated by an outside or out of company source 
and are filled in just once. Another prior art method involves using a scanner and 
special purpose software for creating an image of the form 
on a display and for printing the form. This method is  
 
expensive, requiring an expensive scanner and expensive 
software. As a result, this method is not in wide use. Still another prior art method uses software drivers, 
which allow a printer to be used in a typewriter mode. 
The disadvantage of this method is that as a user types, 
the user must both watch the monitor or screen to see the 
results of the typing and also look inside the printer to 
determine where the print head is located to determine if 
the typing will occur where desired. This method is very 
clumsy to utilize. It is an object of the present invention to provide a low 
cost method and apparatus for filling in forms with a data 
processing system. A method of the present invention scans a segment of 
a form and displays the scanned segment. Information is 
accepted in selected locations on the scanned segment. The 
accepted information is printed in the selected locations 
on the scan segment. The scanning, accepting and printing 
steps are repeated for a new

<CLAIMS>
A method of filling in a form with a data processing 
system and a printer, comprising the steps of: 


a) scanning a segment of said form and displaying said 

scanned segment; 
b) accepting information in selected locations on said 
scanned segment; and 
c) printing said information in said selected locations 
on said scanned segment and repeating steps a)-c) 

until said form has been completed. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said step of scanning a 
segment of said form further comprises the step of 

scanning one or more lines of said form. 
The method of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said step of 
accepting information in selected locations on said 

scanned segment further comprises the step of 
allowing a user to type in said information in said 

locations selected by said user. 
The method of Claim 1 or 3, further comprising the 
step of locating a scanner upstream along a paper 

path from a means for printing on paper before the 
step of scanning a segment of said form and 

displaying said scanned segment. 
The method of Claim 4, wherein said step of repeating 
said steps of scanning a segment of said form and 

displaying said scanned segment, accepting 
information in selected locations on said scanned 

segment and printing said information in said 
selected locations on said scanned segment further 

comprises the 
 

step of advancing said form along said paper path so 
as to locate said scanned segment adjacent to said 

means for printing and a next segment which is adjacent 
to said scanned segment adjacent to said scanner. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein: 

a) said step of scanning a segment of said form further 
comprises the step of scanning one or more lines of 

said form; 
b) said step of accepting information in selected locations 
on said scanned segment further comprises the 

step of allowing a user to type in said information 
in said locations selected by said user; 
c) locating a scanner upstream along a paper path from a 
means for printing on paper before the step of scanning 

a segment of said form and displaying said 
scanned segment; and 
d) said step of repeating said steps of scanning a segment 
of said form and displaying said scanned segment, 

accepting information in selected locations on 
said scanned segment and printing said information in 

said selected locations on said scanned segment further 
comprises the step of advancing said form along 

said paper path so as to locate said scanned segment 
adjacent to said means for printing and a next segment 

which is adjacent to said scanned segment adjacent 
to said scanner. 
An apparatus for filling in a form with a data processing 
system, comprising: 
a) means for receiving from a scanner a scanner segment 
of said form and for displaying said scanned segment; 
b) means for accepting information in selected locations 
on said scanned segment; 
c) means for providing to a printer said information in 
said selected locations on said scanned segment. 
The apparatus of Claim 7 wherein said means for receiving 
from a scanner a scanned segment of said form 

further comprises means for scanning one or more 
lines of said form. 
The apparatus of Claim 7 or 8 wherein said means for 
accepting information in selected locations on said 

scanned segment further comprises means for allowing 
a user to type in said information in said locations 

selected by said user. 
The apparatus of any of the claims 7 or 9 wherein 
said means for accepting information in selected 

locations on said scanned segment further comprises 
means for allowing a user to type in said information 

in said locations selected by said user. 
An apparatus for filling in a form, comprising: 

a) a user interface; 
b) a data processing system connected to said user interface; 
c) a printer connected to said data processing system, 
said printer further comprising means for printing on 

paper, a paper path located adjacent to said means

paper path and upstream along said paper path from 
said means for printing. 
The apparatus of Claim 11 further comprising means 
for moving said form by said means for printing and
