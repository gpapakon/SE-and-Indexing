<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing the extent to which microorganisms, particularly bacteria, will adhere to a surface, which comprises providing a surface having pendant groups of formula (I), in which each group R is the same or different and is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and a is from 1 to 4, use of compounds containing a group of formula (I) in reducing the extent to which microorganisms would adhere to a surface and use of articles comprising such surfaces in environments susceptible to microorganism adhesion. The method has application in a wide variety of industrial or domestic fields wherever it is desirable to prevent growth of microorganisms as well as in the medical field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new method of
reducing the extent to which microorganisms will adhere to
a surface. It also relates to the use of certain compounds
in reducing the adhesion of microorganisms to a surface.In many areas of technology the adhesion and
consequent growth of microorganism such as bacteria, yeast,
algae or fungi on surfaces can cause severe problems. Thus
the adhesion of bacteria can cause malfunctions in
machinery where for example the bacteria fouls the flow of
a liquid over a solid surface; this can lead to an increase
in drag and possibly blockage of the flow of liquid.
Prolonged growth of microorganisms on a surface may
moreover lead to corrosion, either by altering the pH or
redox environment at the surface or by biodegradation of
organic materials.In addition the growth of microorganisms on a surface
can pose a health hazard. Where a material is used as an
optical material bacterial adhesion may reduce optical
quality and thus performance.Thus there are a wide variety of industrial and
domestic applications where bacterial, algal, yeast or
fungal adhesion may have an adverse effect. These include
human and veterinary medicine, ophthalmology, wound
dressings, dentistry, bioseparations, marine and freshwater
shipping, transport of fluids through piping - e.g. in the
oil industry, optics, optical and electronic communications 
systems, aviation and aeronautics, the food and drink
industry, laboratory equipment, agricultural machinery,
storage containers and packaging, fermentation processes
and air-conditioning systems.One specific area in which microorganism adhesion is
a particular problem is human and veterinary medicine.
Bacterial adhesion to and colonisation of prostheses
inserted into the body for example intravenous, intraarterial,
intra-peritoneal and urinary catheters presents a
serious clinical problem. In-dwelling catheters are the
single most important source of hospital acquired
infection, the clinical symptoms ranging from slight
peripheral phlebitis to lethal septicaemia with multiple
organ abscesses. Chemotherapeutic treatment of these
infections is very difficult, and usually requires removal
of the catheter. Even in cases where the patient remains
healthy, bacterial colonisation can lead to build up of a
biofilm with attendant mineral deposition, leading to
blockage, and hence malfunction of the catheter. These
problems may be alleviated by constructing catheters of
material which does not cause bacteria to adhere to its
surface.In EP-A-0140854
