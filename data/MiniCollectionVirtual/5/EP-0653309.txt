<ABSTRACT>
In order to enable an easy adjustment of the transverse position 
of the print image by the stencil printer, in a stencil printer having a 

printing drum carriage means for supporting a printing drum to be 
freely rotatable at a fixed axial position and for moving the printing 

drum between the operating position in the printer and the draw out 
position outside of the printer, there is provided a print image 

transverse position adjustment means acting between the printing drum 
carriage means mounted at a positing for bringing the printing drum at 

the operating position within the printer frame body and the printer 
frame body for a fine adjustment of the axial position of the printing 

drum carriage means relative to the printer frame body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a stencil printer
according to claim 1.In the present specification the
transverse position means a position specified along the direction of
extension of the central axis of the printing drum.From the document JP-U-64046258 a generic stencil printer is
known. This stencil printer comprises a frame body in which a
printing drum is supported. The printed drum can be adjusted in
the transverse direction within the frame body. In conventional rotary type stencil printers each equipped with a
printing drum, the printing drum is mounted in a printer frame body to
be rotatable about a central axis thereof at a fixed transverse position
relative to the printer frame body. In those conventional stencil
printers, an adjustment of the transverse position of the print image is
available by appropriately adjusting the mounting position of a stencil
sheet to the printing drum with respect to its transverse position when
it is done before the stencil sheet is mounted around the printing drum,
or regardless of before or after the mounting of the stencil sheet to
the printing drum, an adjustment of the printed image transverse
position is available by shifting a print sheet feed means in the
transverse direction relative to the printing drum.However, the shifting of a stencil sheet or a print sheet relative
to the printing drum in the transverse directions along the central axis
of the printing drum requires that the stencil sheet or the printing
sheet having a rectangular configuration generally longer in the
direction perpendicular to the direction of movement than in the
direction of movement is shifted correctly in the direction of
movement, in spite of the requirement that such a transverse
adjustment for print image should generally be fine and precise. In
order to meet with such requirements, the means for transversely
shifting a stencil sheet feed means or a print sheet feed means
relative to the printing drum requires a precise parallel guide means
including at least a pair of guide rails or the like spaced apart from
one another in the direction of feeding the stencil sheet or the print 
sheet and delicate driving means for shifting the stencil sheet feed
means or the print sheet feed means along such a pair of guide rails
or the like at respective corresponding portions exactly in
synchronization.In view of the above-mentioned requirements of complicated
constructions for transversely shifting the stencil sheet feed means or
the print sheet feed means along the central axis
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stencil printer comprising:

a frame body (30, 34, 36),
a printing drum (10),
a printing drum carriage means (24) supporting said
printing drum to be freely rotatable around its central

axis at a predetermined axial position thereof, said
printing drum carriage means being suspended from said

frame body of the printer to be movable in the direction of
extension of the central axis of said printing drum

relative to said frame body so as to move said printing
drum between an operating position thereof located inside

of the printer and a dismounting position thereof located
outside of the printer, and
a print image transverse position adjustment means
(58, 60, 72-104, 200, 300) acting between said printing

drum carriage means and said frame body for finely
adjusting the position of said printing drum located at

said operating position relative to said frame body along
the central axis thereof,

   wherein said print image transverse position
adjustment means comprises: 


a first connection element (58) provided on said
printing drum carriage means,
a drive means (60, 96-104) supported from said frame
body and including a second connection element (60) movable

along the central axis of said printing drum,
a lateral groove (72) formed in one of said first and
second connection elements,
a lug (76) mounted on the other of said first and
second connection elements to be laterally movable between

a first position engaged in said lateral groove (72) to
hold relative movement between said first and second

connection elements along the central axis of said printing
drum and a second position disengaged from said groove,
a lug movement means (78-90) for moving said lug
between said first and second positions,
a latch disengagement instruction means (214), and
a control means (200) for controlling said drive means
(60, 96-104) and said lug movement means (78-90) in

response to said latch disengagement instruction means
(214) such that,

   when the disengagement of said lug from said groove
was instructed by said latch disengagement instruction

means, said drive means moves said second connection
element in a first direction along the central axis of said

printing drum and thereafter reverses the direction of
movement to a second direction opposite to said first

direction, while said lug movement means moves said lug
from said first position to said second position at an

instant when the direction of movement of said second
connection element is reversed.
A stencil printer according to claim 1, wherein said print image transverse position
adjustment means (58, 60, 72-104, 200, 300) further comprises:


a standard position detection means (95) for detecting a standard transverse
position of said printing drum carriage means relative to said frame body,
a bias measurement means (96-104, 200) for measuring a transverse biasing
amount of said printing drum carriage means relative to said frame body from said

standard transverse position, and
a transverse position instruction means (300) for instructing a change of the
print image transverse position,

   wherein said printing drum carriage means is returned to said standard
transverse position in response to a return instruction signal from said transverse

position instruction means with the return thereof to said standard transverse
position being detected by said standard position detection means, and is moved to a

leftward or rightward biased position with respect to said standard position in
response to a leftward or rightward biased instruction signal from said transverse

position instruction means with the positioning thereof to the leftward or rightward
biased position being estimated by said bias measurement means.
A stencil printer according to claim 2, wherein said print image transverse position
adjustment means (58, 60, 72-104, 200, 300) further comprises a transverse amount

memory means (200) for storing a transverse amount measured by said bias
measurement means (96-104, 200), and reproduces said bias amount stored by said

bias amount memory means after the transverse position of said printing drum
carriage means has been returned to said standard transverse position.
A stencil printer according to claim 2 or 3, further comprising a print image
position indication means (312) for indicating the transverse adjustment position of

the print image by said print image transverse position adjustment means, said print 
image position indication means comprising means for indicating a standard print

position indication mark (314) of a rectangular configuration representing a print
sheet, and a biased print position indication mark (316) of a rectangular

configuration adapted to change a transverse position thereof relative to said
standard print position indication mark in accordance with the transverse biasing

amount from said standard transverse position instructed by said transverse position
instruction means (300).
