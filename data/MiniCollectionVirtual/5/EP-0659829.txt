<ABSTRACT>
Weathering-resistant, clear films (sheets) having a thickness of from 0.05 to 1 mm comprising a transparent, impact-resistant plastic, containing   A) from 10 to 90% by weight of a coherent hard phase having a glass transition temperature of above 70 degrees C, B) from 90 to 10% by weight of a tough phase having a glass transition temperature of below -10 degrees C, a mean particle size of less than 130 nm and a nonuniformity of less than 0.2, built up from at least 80% by weight of a lower alkyl acrylate and from 0.5 to 5% by weight of a crosslinking monomer, distributed in the hard phase, C) not more than 0.05% by weight of water-soluble constituents, where at least 15% by weight of the hard phase has been covalently bonded to the tough phase, and the hard phase A is built up from methyl methacrylate or a mixture thereof with at most 20% by weight of a lower alkyl acrylate and the remainder is built up from units of an unsaturated monomer containing a group which absorbs UV radiation, so that the film layer absorbs at least 98% of the incident UV radiation having a wavelength of from 290 to 370 nm.

Weather-resistant clear films having a thickness of
0.05 to 1 mm, consisting of a transparent impact

resistant plastics, containing

A) 10 to 90 wt.-% of a cohesive hard phase with a
glass transition temperature of over 70°C,
B) 90 to 10 wt.-% of a viscous phase distributed in
the hard phase, having a glass transition

temperature of below -10°C, an average particle
size of the viscous phase of less than 130 nm and a

non-uniformity of the viscous phase particle size
of less than 0.2, synthesised from at least

80 wt.-% (based on B) of a lower alkyl acrylate and
0.5 to 5 wt.-% of a cross-linking monomer with two

or more ethylenically unsaturated, radically
polymerisable groups, and optionally other

conventional ethylenically unsaturated, radically
(co)polymerisable aliphatic comonomers,
C) not more than 0.05 wt.-% of water-soluble
ingredients,

wherein at least 15 wt.-% of the hard phase is
covalently linked to the viscous phase, characterised in

that the hard phase A is made up of methyl methacrylate
or a mixture thereof with at most 20% by weight (based

on A) of an n-alkyl acrylate having 1 to 4 carbon atoms
in the alkyl moiety and, for the remainder, of

polymerised units of an ethylenically unsaturated,
radically polymerisable monomer with a UV-radiation-absorbing

group in a quantity such that the film layer
absorbs at least 98% of the incident UV-radiation of a

wavelength of 290 to 370 nm.
Film according to claim 1, characterised in that
the viscous phase contains, as cross-linking monomer, a

graft cross-linker or a cross-linking monomer with three
or more ethylenically unsaturated, radically 

polymerisable groups.
Film according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that a scratch resistant coating of a strongly crosslinked

plastics is arranged on the surface thereof.
Film according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that its surface is at least partly

coated with a water-repellant coating.
Film according to claim 4, characterised in that
the water-repellant coating is covered with a layer of a

water-soluble solid material.
Moulding with a water-resistant coating, containing
a solid substrate and a film according to one or more of

claims 1 to 5 adhesively mounted over at least part of
its surface.
Coated moulding according to claim 6, characterised
in that the film is applied by thermal lamination.
Coated moulding according to claim 6, characterised
in that the film is laminated onto the substrate by

means of a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer.
Coated moulding according to one or more of claims
6 to 8, characterised in that the solid substrate has a

retro-reflective surface in the region of the film
coating.
