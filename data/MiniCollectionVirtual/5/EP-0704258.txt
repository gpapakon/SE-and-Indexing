<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a lower tool (1) and an upper tool (2), the lower tool having a chamber (3) on its upper side, which via a conduit (4) is connectable to a controlled hydraulic source. On the upper side of the lower tool is set an all-round fluid seal (5). The upper tool consists of two parts, via. a draw ring (6) and a form stamp (7) which has the shape contour. The contour can be flat or slightly arched, i.e. an engine bonnet or the roof of a vehicle. On the lower tool the plate (8) is laid and then the lower and upper tools are moved together, until the plate is tensioned in the dividing plane between the draw ring and the upper side of the lower tool, and at the same time the seal seals the inner space. Pressure medium is fed via the conduit into the chamber so that the plate is arched in the form of a membrane.

Method for forming sheet metal, in that a blank (8) is clamped in liquid-tight
manner in the parting plane (9) between a top die (2) and a bottom die

(1), whereof one has the form contour (7) and by the action of a hydraulic
pressure medium on its side opposite to the form contour (7) is formed on

the form contour, characterized in that, under the controlled action of the
pressure medium, the blank (8) is firstly preformed up to an expansion of

10 to 15% in the direction of the form contour (7) and subsequently, whilst
maintaining the pressure and redrawing the sheet and without further expansion

is finally formed until resting completely on the form contour (7).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that, at the start of the
forming process, the form contour (7) is set to such a minimum distance from

the parting plane (9), that during preforming the blank (8) zonally
contacts the form contour (7).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that during final
forming, the form contour (7) is moved in the direction of the parting

plane (9).
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that,
during the preforming, the blank (8) is firmly clamped between the top and

bottom dies (2, 1) and during final forming the clamping action is released
to such an extent that the sheet can redraw.
