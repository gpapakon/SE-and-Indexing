<ABSTRACT>
Digital data defining images are stored in a multi-plane 
buffer. The buffer may store plural images by 

restricting data corresponding to an image or image 
portion to less than half the bit planes of the 

buffer. An image is displayed by reading data from 
the buffer and selectively passing only a portion of 

the data read to a display. The data defining the 
images may be converted from facsimile (single bit 

per pixel) to grey scale format (multiple bits per 
pel) before being written to the buffer. The 

conversion relies on a table storing data definitive 
of the effect, on the image, of a facsimile transition 

(1/0 or 0/1) as a function of the location of 
the transition. Conversion from facsimile to grey 

scale is effected by examining the facsimile data 
for data transition and summing the effect of each 

of the transitions to convert a segment of facsimile 
data to grey scale data. 
A system is also disclosed for rapidly converting an image 
in run-end form to a reduced-resolution gray-tone image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improvements in the field of 
soft copy (video) display of facsimile generated 
images such as text and/or graphics. The increasing popularity of teleconferencing has led 
to a desire to provide for soft copy or video display 
of images of limited or no gray scale. In many cases 
the images will have originated as facsimile images, 
but as will become clear hereinafter the invention is 
applicable to any binary image, no matter how 
generated. Typically the originals may consist of 
textual material, either alone or in combination with 
other symbols or images which will be collectively 
hereinafter referred to as graphics. For convenience the resulting soft copy or video 
display desirably complies with NTSC standards and 
the problems imposed by the use of these standards is 
the main problem to be overcome. More particularly, 
an NTSC screen has a 4:3 aspect ratio, and further 
dictates that the video may be displayed in about 480 
vertically displaced parallel scanning lines. 
For example, 512 picture elements (or pixels) are 
horizontally displaced along each scanning line.  On the other hand, the typical graphics image 
originates in a document which may be 8 1 / 2 x 11 or 8 1 / 2 x 
13 or 8 1 / 2 x 14. If we assume that the intelligence 
contained in the original covers about ten inches 
vertically, and if we provide a convenient translation 
between the original, represented by a facsimile 
signal, to our 480 scan line video, then two results 
follow. First, the 8 1 / 2 inch width occupies only about 
half the screen, and secondly, the typewritten text, 
if any, is so small that it cannot be read. One solution to the problem is to provide only hard 
copy, however, this requires that copies be made 
before a teleconference begins (limiting spontaneity) 
and other soft copy functions such as annotation and 
electronically controlled pointers are not available. Another solution is to use two monitors, capture the 
top and bottom halves as two separate images, and use 
these two separate images to drive the two different 
monitors. This solution necessarily admits the 
possibility that the break (at the bottom of the 
first image and the top of the next image) may result 
in some information being split across the two 
displays, the solution also requires two independent 
displays and associated refresh buffers. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide 
for soft copy display of such graphics images thus 
making available typical soft copy functions such as 
elect

A method of translating a two tone image to a gray scale 
video image comprising the steps of: 


a) providing a table representing numerical values for 
the effect of transitions in said two tone image on said 

video image; 
b) loading an input buffer with a representation of said 
two tone image; 
c) initializing an output buffer with a numerical value 
to represent a gray scale image consisting of only one of 

said tones; 
d) examining said input buffer to locate a transition 
therein and determining the location of the transition; 
e) extracting, from said table, a numerical value 
corresponding to the location of said transition; 
f) summing said extracted value, using alternating signs 
for said value on alternate summations, with the contents 

of said output buffer; 
g) and repeating in sequence steps (d), (e) and (f) until 
each transition in said input buffer is processed, 

wherein said value is considered to have a sign opposite 
to a sign of the contents of said output buffer for an 

initial execution of said summing step. 
The method of claim 1 which includes the further steps 
of: 


(d1) determining if the transition is located more than a 
fixed distance from a reference location; and 
(d2) in the event said transition is located further than 
said fixed distance from said reference location, summing 

a constant, of the largest numerical value in said table, 
with the contents of said output buffer. 
The method of claim 1 in which the step (a) comprises: 

(a1) limiting said table to the effect of transitions 
located no greater than a fixed distance from a reference 

location, and 
in which said step (f) includes 
(f1) summing a constant with the contents of the output 
buffer for locations greater than said fixed distance 

from a reference location. 
The method of claim 1 in which said two tone image is 
decomposed into units of a fixed dimension for which said 

video image has a corresponding fixed dimension, and 
which a ratio of two tone image units to said video image 

units is not an integer or in which said two tone image 
is decomposed into units of 13 pels per unit for which 

said corresponding video image is 4 pixels so that said 
ratio is 13/4. 
The method of claim 1 in which said tone used to 
initialize said output buffer corresponds to white and 

not black and wherein said transition used as a first 
transition is a white/black transition. 
The method of claim 1 in which said examining step 
includes subtracting, in modulo arithmetic an effect for 

that portion of white runs of length less than a 
predetermined length in said two tone image and in which 

said table is provided with numerical values only for 
those transitions which are located less than said 

predetermined length from a reference location. 
The method of claim 1 in which said step (d) comprises:
(d1) locating a first white/black transition and counting 
modulo n, where n is an integer on which said table is 

based, a distance to said first white/black transition, 
said distance comprising the whole number I counted to 

and the fractional remainder r, modulo n, 
(d2) summing the contents of said output buffer with a 
numerical value directly proportional to I and of sign 

opposite to a sign for the contents of said output buffer 
so that the result is the difference between the original 

contents of said output buffer and said numerical value, 
and said step (e) includes using said remainder r with 

which to access said table. 
The method of claim 7 in which said step (d) further 
comprises: 


(d3) locating a succeeding black/white transition and 
determining, by counting modulo n, the distance to said 

transition location from a reference location for said 
black/white transition, said distance comprising the 

number J counted to and the fractional remainder o, 
modulo n, 
(d4) summing the contents of said output buffer with a 
numerical value directly proportional to J and with a 

like sign so that the result is the arithmetic sum of the 
contents of the output buffer and the numerical value, 

and wherein said step (e) uses the remainder o with which 
to access said table. 
The method of claim 8 in which said steps (d), (d1), 
(d2), (e) and (f) are repeated for white/black 

 
transitions and said steps (d), (d3), (d4), (e) and (f) 

are repeated for black/white transitions.
