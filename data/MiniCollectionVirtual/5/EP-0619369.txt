<ABSTRACT>
An enzyme composition having a synergetic phytate hydrolyzing 
activity comprising a phytase having phytate hydrolyzing 

activity at a pH of from 2.5 to 5.0 and an acid phosphatase

ratio corresponding to a pH 2.5/5.0 activity profile of from 
0.8/1.0 to 3/1. Said enzyme composition preferably displays a 

higher synergetic phytate hydrolyzing efficiency through 
thermal treatment. Fungal enzymes, especially those from 


Aspergillus

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of phytin hydrolysis by
enzymes, in particular phytases, capable of hydrolyzing the
organic phosphorus compound phytate into inorganic phosphorus
and inositol.It is a well established fact that the presence of
essential minerals plays an important role in animal feeding.
The availability and assimilation of these feed components is
reflected in the performance of the animal and the excretion
in the manure. Due to the increase of the intensive livestock
production, manure production causes environmental problems,
partly because of its phosphates. Moreover, legislation
concerning the manure problematic, especially the phosphorus
content of the manure, entails expenses, which makes it
necessary to reduce phosphorus excretion in the environment.Phosphorus is added to the feed by different plant raw
materials, animal byproducts and inorganic phosphorus.Phytic acid or phytate is the hexa-phosphorus ester of
inositol (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate), found in many seeds
and cereals. It acts as the primary storage form of both
phosphorus and inositol and accounts for more than 50 % of the
total phosphorus content (LOLAS et al., 1976; SAUVEUR, 1989).
Oilseeds can contain up to 5.2 % of phytin (REDDY et al.,
1982).However, phytin phosphorus of plant raw materials is
poorly digested by monogastric animals such as poultry, swine
and man because of their simple intestinal tract: they lack or
have only low intestinal phytase activity to catalyze the
hydrolysis of these phytates in their intestine and phytin
phosphorus released in the colon is excreted in the environment. 
Plant raw materials are by these means poor phosphorus
sources for animal feeding, and additional phosphorus has to
be included in the diet by animal byproducts or inorganic
phosphates.Moreover, phytin is considered as an anti-nutritional
factor due to its chelating properties: it binds many
multivalent cations such as Ca2+, Fe3+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ by
forming insoluble complexes therewith and hence reduces the
bioavailability and absorption of these essential dietary
minerals. Besides, complexation of proteins with phytin
(COSGROVE, 1966) obstructs enzymic protein digestion.The negative effects of phytin on phosphorus and
mineral metabolism, coupled to a high phosphorus excretion in
the environment and the existence of a legislation concerning
phosphorus excretion, makes it necessary to render phytin
phosphorus bioavailable.Phytin can be hydrolysed enzymatically by phytases
either present in plant raw materials or produced
