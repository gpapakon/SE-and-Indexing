<ABSTRACT>
Sealing arrangement (device), particularly a sanitary sealing arrangement, for use when fitting a partition (2, 3) in industrial rooms (premises) to be protected, characterised in that it consists of a wall pier (pillar, pilaster strip) (10, 11, 12) and of a heel (21, 22, 29) which interact to provide total sealing on either side of the partition, the wall pier including a thin longitudinal shell to be arranged so as to bear vertically on the ground and to be fastened so as to bear on the partition in order to delimit a space to be filled with a filling material, and the heel being placed so as to break (chamfer) the corners.
