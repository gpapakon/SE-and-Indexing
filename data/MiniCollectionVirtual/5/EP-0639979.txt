<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition which comprises the c-kit ligand (KL) purified by applicants or produced by applicants' recombinant methods in combination with other hematopoietic factors and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is provided as well as methods of treating patients which comprise administering to the patient the pharmaceutical composition of this invention. This invention provides combination therapies using c-kit ligand (KL) and a purified c-kit ligand (KL) polypeptide, or a soluble fragment thereof and other hematopoietic factors. It also provides methods and compositions for ex-vivo use of KL alone or in combination therapy. A mutated KL antagonist is also described. Such an antagonist may also be a small molecule. Antisense nucleic acids to KL as therapeutics are also described. Lastly, compositions and methods are described that take advantage of the role of KL in germ cells, mast cells and melanocytes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described herein was made in the course of
work under Grant No. RO1-CA 32926 and ACS MV246D from the
National Institute of Health and American Cancer Society,
respectively. The United States Government has certain
rights in this invention.Throughout this application various publications are
referred by arabic numerals to within parenthesis. Full
bibliographic citations for these references may be found at
the end of the specification immediately preceding the
claims.The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine
kinase raceptor for an unidentified ligand and is a member
of the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) - platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) - kit receptor subfamily (7,
41, 57, 23). c-kit was recently shown to be allelic with
the white-spotting (W) locus of the mouse (9, 17, 35).
Mutations at the W locus affect proliferation and/or
migration and differentiation of germ cells, pigment cells
and distinct cell populations of the hematopoietic system
during development and in adult life (47, 51). The effects
on hematopoiesis are on the erythroid and mast cell lineages 
as well as on stem cells, resulting in a macrocytic anemia
which is lethal for homozygotes of the most severe W alleles
(46), and a complete absence of connective tissue and
mucosal mast cells (72). W mutations exert their effects in
a cell autonomous manner (28, 46), and in agreement with
this property, c-kit RNA transcripts were shown to be
expressed in targets of W mutations (35). High levels of c-kit
RNA transcripts were found in primary bone marrow
derived mast cells and mast cell lines. Somewhat lower
levels were found in melanocytes and erythroid cell lines.The identification of the ligand for c-kit is of great
significance and interest because of the pleiotropic effects
it might have on the different cell types which express c-kit
and which are affected by W mutations invivo.
Important insight about cell types which may produce the c-kit
ligand can be derived from the knowledge of the function
of c-kit/W. The lack of mast cells both in the connective
tissue and the gastrointestinal mucosa of W/WV mice
indicated a function for c-kit in mast cell development.
Mast cells derived from bone marrow (BMMC) are dependent on
interleukin 3 (IL-3) and resemble mast cells found in the
gastrointestinal mucosa (MMC) (92, 93). Connective tissue
mast cells derived from the peritoneal cavity (CTMC) in
vitro require both IL-3 and IL-4 for proliferation (79, 75).
The interleukins IL-3 and IL-4 are well characterized
