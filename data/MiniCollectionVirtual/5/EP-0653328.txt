<ABSTRACT>
Signalling apparatus for road vehicles comprises a 
self-contained unit adapted to be mounted at the rear 

of a vehicle. The unit includes a sensor device (16) 
at least responsive to the deceleration of the vehicle 

and independent of operation of a brake pedal, and a 
lighting device (11-15) independent of the lights of 

the vehicle and visible to following vehicles. The 
lighting device (11-15) is adapted to be illuminated to 

emit a warning signal by means of an electric current 
supplied to the device through an electrical circuit 

under the control of the sensor device, and the 
electrical circuit incorporates a control device (IC 1) 

for supplying intermittent pulses to the lighting 
device (11-15) to cause the light means to emit a 

flashing signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in
signalling apparatus for road vehicles.Currently vehicle brake lights simply indicate the
fact that the brake pedal has been actuated, and do not
indicate the rate of deceleration of the vehicle. This
has the disadvantage that it is difficult for a driver
of a vehicle to tell how hard the vehicle in front is
being braked and, in consequence, for the driver to
receive any indication of the rate of deceleration and
therefore what effective braking distance is available
to him. This often leads to accidents, particularly on
motorways. There have been proposals for indicating
variations in deceleration by varying the intensity or
area of brake lights, in response to excessive
deceleration or brake pressure, but these systems
depend for their operation on the operation of the
normal braking system. Also modification of at least
the existing electrical circuitry is necessary for the
installation of such systems. This, in turn, is
expensive and requires the use of skilled labour.We are aware of US-A-3 559 164 (Bancroft) which
discloses a signalling apparatus comprising self
contained unit adapted to be mounted at the rear of a
vehicle including sensing means responsive to
deceleration of the vehicle. The sensing means
comprises a pendulum which swings in response to
inertia forces generated during emergency braking to
close a contact of an electrical circuit. The document
does not disclose a sensing means which is responsive
to the attitude of the vehicle. According to one aspect of my invention in
signalling apparatus for road vehicles comprising a
self-contained unit adapted to be mounted at the rear
of a vehicle, the unit including light means
independent of the lights of the vehicle and visible to
following vehicles and an electrical circuit, in which
the electrical circuit incorporates means for supplying
intermittent pulses to the light means to cause the
light means to emit a flashing signal, the apparatus
includes sensor means at least responsive to the
deceleration of the vehicle and attitude of the vehicle
independent of operation of a brake pedal so that the
light means are illuminated to emit a warning signal at
least when the vehicle is at an abnormal attitude.The sensor means is adapted to energise the light
means to achieve illumination when the rate of
deceleration of the vehicle exceeds a predetermined
value. Thus the driver of a following vehicle is given
an instant and automatic warning of rapid deceleration
of a vehicle ahead.
