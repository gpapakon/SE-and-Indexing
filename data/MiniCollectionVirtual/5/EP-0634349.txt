<ABSTRACT>
A dock leveler assembly (I,II) is provided having an 
automatic barrier (230;330) actuated in response to movement of the 

lip for preventing accidental runoff of material handling 
vehicles from the loading dock. The assembly includes a 

ramp for pivotal movement between a stored first position 
wherein an exposed surface thereof is coplanar with the 

loading dock platform surface (212;312), an upwardly inclined second 
position, and a declining third position. The lip is 

operatively connected to a front edge portion of the ramp 
for movement from a depending position to an outwardly 

extended cantilevered position. The assembly 
includes a barrier unit (230;330) movable between operative and 

inoperative modes. When in the operative mode, a portion 
of the barrier unit automatically projects above the ramp 

exposed surface and forms a vehicle safety barrier of 
optimum height.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dock leveler according to 
the preamble of claim 1 and more particularly to a dock 
leveler assembly which when in one mode automatically 
provides a barrier to prevent material handling equipment 
from accidentally running off the exposed front end of the 
loading dock. Loading dock levelers, sometimes called 
dockboards, are used to facilitate the loading and 
unloading of variously sized vehicles which are parked 
adjacent to a loading dock that has a working surface 
above the roadway adapted to adjoin the bed of a parked 
vehicle. Examples of loading dock leveler assemblies are 
disclosed in US-AS 3,583,014, 
3,699,601, 3,728,753, 4,110,860, 4,257,137, 4,531,248, 
4,570,277 and 4,744,121. Such dock levelers compensate 
for height variations between the bed of the parked 
vehicle and the working sometimes referred hereafter as 
platform surface, surface of the dock since they are 
typically disposed in a pit or recess at the front of the 
loading dock and include a ramp pivotal between a raised 
position above the working surface of the dock and a below 
dock level position. An extension plate or lip is hinged 
to the front edge of the ramp and is movable to an 
extended position to span the gap between the bed of the 
parked vehicle and the front edge of the ramp. When such  
 
dock levelers are not in use, they are stored in a cross-traffic 
position having the an exposed upper surface of 
ramp flush with the working surface of the dock and the 
lip disposed in a depending position. In the practical implementation of such dock 
levelers certain safety problems may arise. Loading dock 
personnel may accidentally drive or push fork lift trucks 
or related material handling equipment off the exposed 
front end of the dock leveler when there is no vehicle 
parked adjacent the loading dock and the dock leveler is 
stored in the cross-traffic position. Dock levelers have heretofore been provided to 
minimize the risk of such accidental run off. Such dock 
levelers utilize a lip pivotally fixed to the front edge 
of the ramp wherein the pivot axis of the lip is set 
outwardly, or forwardly, a substantial distance from the 
rear edge of the lip. Such a design allows the rear 
section of the lip between the pivot axis and the lip rear 
edge to project above the ramp surface and form a barrier 
when the lip is not in its fully extended cantilevered 
position. When such a lip is in positions between the 
stored depending position and the fully extended 
cantilevered position, the

<CLAIMS>
A dock leveler for a loading dock having a substantially 
horizontal platform surface, said dock leveler comprising: 


a frame having a rear section; 
a ramp having a rear edge portion hingedly connected to 
the frame rear section, said ramp being movable between a 

stored substantially horizontal first position and a 
predetermined upwardly inclined second position; 
a lip operatively connected to a front edge portion of 
the ramp and movable between a stored position and an 

outwardly extended cantilevered position when said ramp 
assumes said second position; and 
barrier means (230; 330) movable between an operative 
mode and an inoperative mode, said barrier means (230; 

330) being in an operative mode when said ramp is in the 
first position and said lip is in the stored position, 

whereby a predetermined portion of said barrier means 
(230; 3
30) and projects above the exposed surface (212; 
312) of the ramp and forms a safety barrier, while when 

said barrier means (230; 330) is in an inoperative mode 
it assumes a non-projecting position relative to the 

exposed surface (212; 312) of the ramp, said barrier 
means being in said inoperative mode when said lip is in 

the outwardly extended cantilevered position,
 
characterized by actuator means (252; 260) for raising 

said barrier means (230; 330) to an operative mode when 
said lip is moved to the stored position, and for 

lowering said barrier means (230; 330) to an inoperative 
mode when said lip is moved to the outwardly extended 

cantilevered position, the actuator means (25) being 
also capable of raising and lowering said barrier 

means (230; 330) independently of the angular 
position of the ramp. 
The dock leveler of claim 1 wherein said barrier means 
comprises an intermediate plate section (230) extending 

substantially across the width of said ramp. 
The dock leveler of claim 1 wherein said barrier means 
comprises a plurality of relatively spaced post-like 

members (330). 
The dock leveler of claim 3 wherein said actuator means 
(260) is operatively connected to said member (330) and 

effects controlled endwise movement thereof between 
operative and inoperative modes.
