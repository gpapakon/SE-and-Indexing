<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connecting structure in 
which structural elements such as segments are connected together, 
a plurality of these structural elements being connected together 
to form a cylindrical tunnel wall member, for example. When forming tunnel wall members, a typical structure 
employed for the segment connecting structure is one in which a 
joint plate having a hole is recessed in the vicinity of the 
segment's connecting surface. The connecting surfaces of the 
segments are brought into contact with one another, with the joint 
plate holes aligned so as to communicate. A bolt is then passed 
through the communicating holes in this state, and a nut is fastened 
on to the bolt to affect the connection. However, the above structure requires that the extremely 
troublesome operation of passing the bolt through the holes formed 
in the connecting surfaces of the joint plates, and then fastening 
a nut over the bolt, be performed at the construction site. Moreover, in the above-described structure, fastening of the 
nut onto the bolt becomes difficult if there is even a slight 
positional deviation between the segments. As a result, work may 
be delayed. The present invention's connecting structure is one in which 
the structural members are connected with their connecting 
surfaces mutually aligned. The present invention's connecting 
structure is connected by means of a connecting rod attached to 
one structural member and projecting outward from its connecting 
surface in the direction of another structural member, and a 
connector attached to the other structural member which engages 
with this connecting rod. This connector is provided with a tapered 
sleeve, the diameter of its inner circumferential surface 
gradually widening in the direction of insertion of the connecting 
rod; a plurality of wedges which are disposed in a circle within 
the sleeve to form an insertion fixing hole for the connecting rod 
at their mutual center, the plurality of wedges being disposed so 
as to be freely moveable in the longitudinal direction of the 
sleeve, with the outer circumferential surfaces of the wedges in 
contact with the inner circumferential surface of the sleeve; and 
a elastic member for biasing the wedges toward the rear of the 
direction of insertion of the connecting rod. In the case where connecting structural members using this 
connecting structure, the wedges retreat toward the bottom of the 
sleeve, compressing the elastic member, when the connecting rod 
is pushed into
