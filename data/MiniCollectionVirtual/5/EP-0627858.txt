<ABSTRACT>
An encoded video data re-compressing apparatus further 
compresses, for further transmission or storage, an encoded video 

data stream that includes quantization parameters and quantized 
coefficients without having to decompress the encoded video data 

streams and subsequently re-compress the decompressed video 
data. The encoded video data stream is parsed for extracting the 

quantization parameters and quantized coefficients from other side 
information. The quantized coefficients are either divided by a 

predetermined integer or selectively discarded to reduce the total 
number of bits. In the former case, the corresponding quantization 

parameters are multiplied by a predetermined integer. The 

manipulated coefficients and quantization parameters are 
multiplexed with the side information, such that they occupy the 

location of the corresponding original coefficients and quantization 
parameters in the video data stream. Equipped with a digital data 

recorder and a set of switches, the encoded digital video data 
stream could be recorded in either its original form (a normal 

recording mode) or a more compact form (a long recording mode) 
by dividing the quantized coefficients by a predetermined integer 

or selectively discarding some of the coefficients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for further
compressing encoded digital video data streams for transmission
and storage, and more particularly to a recording apparatus that is
capable of recording an encoded digital video data stream in either
its original form or a more compact form.Numerous video bit-rate reduction coding schemes are known
for compressing digitized video signals for transmission and storage
at a reduced bit rate. Activities for developing these techniques are
widely under progress. International standards have been created,
while some are still under development, by organizations such as
the ITU and ISO.The motion-compensated transform coding algorithm is
currently the most widely used method and has been adopted as
the key technique by major international standards such as H. 261,
MPEG1 and MPEG2 for compressing digital video sequences. A wide
variety of literature on this coding method is available, an example
of which is published in "The MPEG Video Compression Algorithm",
Signal Processing, Image Communication, Vol. 4 No. 2, April 1992,
pp. 129-140. Briefly, the algorithm works in the following manner.
A current picture is divided into adjacent blocks, each containing a
matrix of pixel data. For each block, a motion vector is detected by 
comparing the current block to a reference picture to find the best-matched
prediction among possible blocks in the reference picture.
The difference between the predicted block and the current block,
i.e., the prediction error, is further compressed using an orthogonal
transformation to remove spatial correlation. The transformed
coefficients are quantized by a quantization parameter to discard
the less important information. Finally, the motion vectors and
quantization parameters are combined with the quantized
coefficients and other side information for transmission or storage
using fixed or variable length codes.Another popular method for image compression is the
subband/wavelet coding scheme, where an image is divided into a
plurality of bands by using bandpass filters and each band is
quantized and coded with a coder specifically adapted to it. In a
fashion similar to the transform coding scheme, temporal
redundancy is reduced by motion compensation. Motion-compensated
prediction subbands are subtracted from the
subbands of the original picture. The subband prediction errors are
quantized by a quantization parameter and coded, together with
the quantization parameters, motion vectors and other side
information, before
