<ABSTRACT>
A combined expansion and buckling dowel is produced from a metal or metal alloy by cold pressing. It can be used universally and, depending on the nature of the wall in which the bore is provided, effects an expansion action or a buckling action with corresponding snarling.

Dowel unit consisting of a metal straddling dowel and
a screw (30) having the following features:


the dowel is manufactured in one piece from a
metal or a metal alloy, preferably by the cold-pressing

process;
the dowel consists of a closed, hollow
cylindrical dowel head (10), a dowel body (12)

in the form of straddling segments (18) formed
by longitudinal slots (16), and a solid dowel

foot (14) with an axial screw thread (22) for
screwing in the thread (32) of the screw (30),

which brings about an axial bracing with
buckling of the straddling segments;
the internal diameter of the dowel head (10)
and dowel body (12) is greater than the

diameter of the shank of the screw (30);

characterised in that

the radial thickness of the straddling segments
(18) decreases from both ends of the dowel body

(12) to the middle section thereof;
the straddling segments (18) and/or the dowel
head (10) have radial and/or axial fins on the

outside;
the dowel foot (14) is conically tapered
slightly (24);
running all round the transition zone between
the dowel foot (14) and the dowel body (12) is

an attenuating groove (26) for forming
straddling segment joints.
Dowel unit according to claim 1,

characterised in that the dowel is made from a steel
alloy designated as R Q St 34.3.
Dowel unit according to claim 1,

characterised in that the dowel is made from a light
metal alloy.
Dowel unit according to claim 2,

characterised in that the dowel foot (14) has a
machine thread (22).
Dowel unit according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the screw (30) is provided with
a machine thread (32) or with a wood thread.
Dowel unit according to claim 1,

characterised in that the dowel body is equipped with
slits (116) which extend in a helical line and

between which dowel segments (118) are left which
extend in a helical line.
Dowel unit according to claim 6,

characterised in that the pitch of the helix-shaped 
slits (116) is left-handed with a metric right-handed

thread (22).
Dowel unit according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that a flange (120) is formed onto
the dowel head (10).
