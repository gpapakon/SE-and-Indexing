<ABSTRACT>
The pouch is formed of first and second thin barrier film
walls welded along the periphery to form a waste receptacle. One

wall has an inlet defined by an attachment ring. The ring mounts
the pouch on an adhesive faceplate adapted to adhere to the skin

surrounding the stoma. A membrane, formed of material which is gas
permeable but tran
smits little moisture and no liquid, is situated
between the walls to separate the receptacle into an inlet chamber,

where solids, liquid and most moisture are retained, and an outlet
chamber into which gas and a small amount of vapor passes. A

filter is provided to permit the gas to exit the outlet chamber.
A first section of superabsorbent material isolates the filter from

the outlet chamber. By absorbing any moisture in the gas before it
contacts the filter, blockage of the filter is prevented. A second

section of superabsorbant material is provided near the bottom of
the output chamber to absorb moisture which otherwise may cause the

membrane to stick to the pouch wall, resulting in a substantial
reduction of the gas transmissibility of the membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ostomy devices and more
particularly to an ostomy pouch with enhanced gas filtration properties.Ostomy pouches of various sizes and types are designed
for use by individuals who have undergone ileostomy or colostomy
surgery and as a result have a stoma or artificial opening formed
in the abdominal wall which serves as a discharge outlet for waste
material. The ostomy pouch is affixed to the patient's abdomen
over the stoma so as to collect the waste material as it is discharged.
In order to prevent the escape of liquid or solid waste,
it is necessary that a fluid tight seal be maintained between the
pouch and the skin surrounding the stoma.Certain problems occur as a result of the fluid tight
seal. Discharge of gas from the intestine through the stoma causes
the pouch to become inflated. The inflation of the pouch, which is
normally visually inconspicuous, may cause embarrassment to the
wearer as the pouch becomes noticeable, even through clothing. The
pressure created by the gas in the pouch, if it is not allowed to
escape, may build up to the point where it causes acute discomfort.
In the extreme situation, a high enough pressure may cause the 
fluid tight seal between the pouch and the skin to be disrupted,
releasing odors and possibly waste material.In order to overcome the problems associated with the
accumulation of gases within the pouch, pouches have been designed
with various types of vents which control the release of the gas.
In addition, such vents have been used in conjunction with replaceable
deodorizing filters through which the gas must pass as it is
vented.However, the nature of the material from which the gas
filter is composed is such that moisture in the form of water vapor
or liquid, or solid waste material, will tend to block the filter,
if permitted to contact it. Accordingly, it is known to interpose
a barrier to divide the pouch into inlet and outlet chambers. The
barrier may be provided with a relatively small gas opening which
is offset from the inlet and vent hole. This creates a serpentine
path which permits gas to pass from the inlet chamber to the outlet
chamber but prevents most liquid and solid waste from entering the
outlet chamber. This structure is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,411,659 issued October 25, 1983 to Jensen et al.Although the Jensen barrier is an improvement over conventional
pouch structures, it does not completely eliminate moisture
and liquid from entering the outlet chamber and contacting the
filter. Accordingly, it

<CLAIMS>
An ostomy pouch (A) comprising first (10) and second
walls (12) joined along at least a portion of the

periphery (14) to define a waste receptical, an
inlet opening (20) in said first wall, means for

adhering the pouch to the body with the stoma
aligned with said inlet opening, a gas vent

hole (44) in said second wall, filter means (46) covering
said vent hole, a gas permeable membrane (34)

interposed between said walls, dividing said
receptical into an inlet chamber (40) and an outlet

chamber (42), 
characterized in that
 a superabsorbent material (48) covers
said filter means to prevent blockage of the

vent filter by removing moisture from the gas
before it passes through the filter.
The pouch of claim 1 wherein said membrane (34)
transmits little moisture and substantially no

liquid.
The pouch of claim 1 wherein said membrane (34)
comprises a calcium carbonate filled polyethylene

microporous film.
The pouch of claim 1 further comprising a layer
of flocking (18) mounted on the exterior surface of said

first wall.
The pouch of claim 1 wherein said pouch 
adhering means comprises an adhesive faceplate (B) and

means (22, 28) for mounting said faceplate to the exterior
surface of said first wall.
The pouch of claim 5 wherein said mounting
means comprises first (28) and second coupling rings (22)

affixed to said faceplate (B) and said pouch (A);
respectively.
The pouch of claim 6 wherein said coupling
rings are detachable.
