<DESCRIPTION>
(S)-3-Amino-1-benzylpyrrolidine and (S)-3-[(S)-2-{tert-butoxycarbonylamino}-propionylamino]
pyrrolidine are key intermediates required for the
synthesis of several quinolone antibacterial agents
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Numbers
4,851,418 and 4,916,141. Known processes for the
synthesis of optically active 3-amino-1-substituted-pyrrolidines
include the conversion of 1-benzyl-3-pyrroline
to (S)-3-amino-1-benzylpyrrolidine in four
steps in 60% overall yield with an enantiomeric
excess of 84% (H. C. Brown, J. V. N. Vara Prasad,
A. K. Gupta, J. Org. Chem., 51, 4296 (1986); T. Rosen
et al, J. Med. Chem., 31, 1586 (1988); D. T. W. Chu,
T. J. Rosen, European Patent Application EP 331,960).
This process uses the relatively expensive
hydroboration reagent, diisopinocampheylborane. In a
second process trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline is converted
into (S)-3-amino-1-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-pyrrolidine in
five steps in 77% overall yield with an enantiomeric
excess greater than 99%, U.S. Patent 4,851,418;
however, the trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline starting
material is expensive. Racemic 3-amino-1-benzylpyrrolidine
has been resolved in low yield by
fractional crystallization of the salt with L-tartaric
acid (Tokyo Ksei Kogyo, Japanese Patent
J02218-664A (1989). Chiral butane derivatives with
leaving groups (chloro or methanesulfonyloxy) at
positions 1, 2, and 4 were treated with primary
amines to give chiral 3-(substituted amino)-1-substituted 
pyrrolidines (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Japanese
Patent J91020-391-B (1987); European Patent
Publication 443498)). Finally the relatively
inexpensive L-aspartic acid was converted to (S)-3-amino-1-phenylpyrrolidine
via 3-[N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-1-phenylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione,
although in low overall yield (D. T. Witiak, et al,
J. Med. Chem., 14, 24 (1971).Due to its low cost, L-aspartic acid appears to
be the most attractive starting material for the
preparation of (S)-3-amino-1-substituted-pyrrolidines.
The literature method from L-aspartate
(D. T. Witiak, loc. cit.) involves treatment of N-boc-L-aspartate
with acetic anhydride to give (S)-3-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)succinic
anhydride
followed by addition of a primary amine and ring
closure with heat to give the succinimide, (S)-3-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-1-substituted
pyrrolidine-2,5-dione.
The latter is then reduced and deblocked
to give the 1-substituted-3-aminopyrrolidine in low
overall yield. From our experience with this method
some racemization takes place when the blocking group
is p-toluenesulfonyl(tosyl) and the
