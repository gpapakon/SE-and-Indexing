Process for changing the behaviour of worker-bees of 
a breeding colony in an orphan or starter hive or in the 

orphan section of a hive, comprising transplantation of 

larvae into the cups of an appropriate frame or shelf 
suitable for enabling feeding of said larvae by the 

breeding colony and introduction of this frame or shelf 
into this starter or this orphan section in contact with 

the breeding colony, this process being characterized by 
incorporation of an effective proportion of a bouquet 

based on one or more pheromones into the component 
material, in particular wax, of said cups before 

transplantation of the larvae into these. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is such that it enables 

the increase in percentages of acceptance, by workers, of 
the larvae transplanted. 
Process in accordance with claim 2, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is mainly based on methyl 

stearate. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is such that it enables 

the increase in the quantity of royal jelly produced by 
the workers. 
Process in accordance with claim 4, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is based mainly on either 

octadecanal, a reconstituted mixture of pheromones and 
aldehydes, or methyl linoleate.  

 
Process in accordance with claim 4, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is based mainly either on 

methyl or ethyl oleate of a concentration of 10⁻³ to 10⁻² 
by weight of the aforementioned component material or on 

methyl palmitate of a concentration of the order of 10⁻³ 
by weight of said component material. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is chosen such that it 

enables more rapid increase in weight of the larvae being 
fed. 
Process in accordance with claim 7, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is based mainly either on 

methyl palmitate of a concentration of the order of 10⁻² 
in particular, or on ethyl palmitate of a concentration 

of the order of 10⁻³ by weight of said component material 
in particular. 
Shelf or frame cup for a starter or breeding hive 
into which a bee-larva can be transplanted, characterized 

by the presence in its component material, in particular 
wax, of a proportion of a bouquet based on one or more 

pheromones, selected at adapted concentrations such that 
the behaviour of the worker-bees of the breeding colony 

can be varied, particularly for increasing the rate of 
acceptance of the larvae by the workers or the quantities 

of royal jelly deposited in the corresponding cups, the 
weight of the larvae accepted or the quantities of royal 

jelly deposited in the cups by the workers. 
Cup in accordance with claim 9, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is mainly based on methyl 

stearate.  
 
Cup in accordance with claim 9, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is based mainly either on 

octadecanal or on a reconstituted mixture of pheromones 
and aldehydes, or on methyl linoleate. 
Cup in accordance with claim 9, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is based mainly either on 

methyl oleate or ethyl oleate of a concentration of 10⁻³ 
to 10⁻² by weight of said component material or on methyl 

palmitate of a concentration of the order of 10⁻³ by 
weight of said component material. 
Cup in accordance with claim 9, characterized in 
that the bouquet of pheromones is based mainly either on 

methyl palmitate of a concentration of the order of 10⁻² 
in particular, or on ethyl palmitate of a concentration 

of the order of 10⁻³ by weight of said component material 
in particular.
