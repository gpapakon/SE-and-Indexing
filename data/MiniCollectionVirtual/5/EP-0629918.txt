<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making a 
lithographic printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion 

transfer process comprising the steps of image-wise exposing an 
imaging element comprising on a support a photosensitive layer 

comprising silver halide emulsion(s) wherein not more than 1 mole% 
of the silver halide is silver bromide and an image receiving layer 

containing physical development nuclei and developing said imaging 
element using an alkaline processing liquid with a pH lower than 

11.5 in the presence of developing agent(s) and a meso-ionic 
compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making a
lithographic printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion
transfer process.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P-2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by Andr√© Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background. For example, typical lithographic printing
plates are disclosed in EP-A-423399 and EP-A-410500.The DTR-image can be formed in the image-receiving layer of a
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called
two-sheet DTR element) or in the image-receiving layer of a
so-called single-support element, also called mono-sheet element,
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion
layer integral with an image-receiving layer in water permeable
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which is
preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the DTR
method. As for other printing plates it is required that the printing
plates obtained according to the DTR-process have a high printing
endurance, good ink acceptance in the printing areas and no ink
acceptance in the non-printing areas (no staining). It is
furthermore desirable that the number of copies that have to be
disposed of because of ink acceptance in the non-printing areas (so
called toning) during start-up of the printing process is limited.
It is furthermore desirable that the printing properties of the
plates obtained according to the DTR-process are not or only
slightly influenced by the exhaustion degree of the processing
solution so that a high number of
