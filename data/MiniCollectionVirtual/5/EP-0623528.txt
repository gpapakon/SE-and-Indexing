<ABSTRACT>
For the transportation and/or storage of waste material, in particular domestic refuse, in closed containers, it is proposed, during the transportation and/or storage period, to scavenge, at least at times, the volume of refuse material enclosed in one container in each case by means of an inert, low-oxygen gas. By replacing the air still contained in the interspaces and pores of the volume of refuse material by the inert gas, aerobic conversion processes are suppressed and, at the same time, moisture is channelled away, thus avoiding the gas development which can otherwise be observed in the case of aerobic conversion of waste materials.
