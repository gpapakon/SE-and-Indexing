<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum alloy powder 
for sliding members and an aluminum alloy therefor which 
exhibit such high strength and wear resistance that they are 
applicable to sliding members of machines such as engines and 
oil pumps, and at the same time which exhibit extremely low 
aggressiveness against mating parts, particularly against the 
mating parts made from aluminum alloys, during sliding 
operation therewith. When aluminum alloys and steels are slid or aluminum 
alloys are slid against each other, the aluminum alloys have 
been known that they are more likely to be seized than steels. 
On the other hand, in order to reduce the weight of the engines 
and the oil pumps, their component parts are often made from 
the aluminum alloys. Accordingly, there arises the engineering 
desire to slide the component parts made from the aluminum 
alloys against each other.  However, as mentioned earlier, the aluminum alloys are 
seized and worn with ease even under low loads. Consequently, 
even if the component parts are made from the aluminum alloys 
and put into practical applications, they are applied to 
sliding operation under extremely low loads, or either of them 
is subjected to surface treatment such as plating and thermal 
spraying. In order to solve the aforementioned problems of the 
aluminum alloys, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 55-24,949, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 55-97,447, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 59-59,855 and Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (KOKAI) No. 2-70,036, there are proposed to add a 
solid lubricant, such as graphite, molybdenum disulfide and 
lead, to an aluminum alloy, and to sinter the mixture, thereby 
improving the sliding property of the resulting aluminum 
alloys. Moreover, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 1-56,844, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 2-129,338, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 2-194,135 and Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (KOKAI) No. 3-264,636, there are proposed to add 
ceramic particles, such as alumina, silicon carbide, zirconium 
dioxide, aluminum composite oxide and aluminum nitride, and to  
 
sinter the mixture, thereby improving the sliding property of 
the resulting aluminum alloy-based composite materials. However, the engineering attempts set forth in the 
publications cannot fully improve the sliding property and wear 
resistance of the resulting aluminum alloys and aluminum
