<ABSTRACT>
A method for inhibiting or preventing emergence and growth 
of algae, comprising use of a germanium compound and a 

herbicide, and an antialgal composition comprising a germanium 
compound and a herbicide. The method of the present invention 

inhibits and prevents emergence and growth of algae, and can be 
used safely with little influence on aquatic animals. The 

method is advantageously used for a fish tank in which fish for 
appreciation is kept, so as to keep good appearance of the tank 

and to reduce burden of cleaning the tank by preventing 
emergence and growth of attached algae. Particularly, the 

composition for artificial seawater of the present invention 
shows no toxicity to marine animals to be raised in the 

artificial seawater prepared using the composition of the 
invention, and can inhibit and prevent emergence of algae. 

Therefore, the composition of the invention can be beneficially 
used for raising, culture, study, and the like of marine 

animals. Moreover, the composition of the present invention 
which is coated on a fish net, a hull, or the like can result in 

inhibition and prevention of emergence and growth of algae in 
the environment where influence on fish, etc. is very little.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for inhibiting or 
preventing emergence and growth of algae. The present 
invention also relates to an antialgal composition capable of 
inhibiting or preventing emergence and growth of algae. Alga is a flora mainly composed of photosynthetic plants 
which grow in waters such as lake water, swamp water, river 
water, and ocean water. It also lives in soil or attaches to 
live on rocks, tree surfaces, body surfaces of animals, and the 
like besides living under water. Algae are generally classified 
by color into green algae, brown algae, and red algae, or by 
characteristics. They may be classified into macroalgae and 
microalgae as well. Algae have been deeply concerned with 
mankind from ancient times, and used as beneficial living 
aquatic resources. However, they also behave unbeneficially 
when culturing fish or the like in a fishing net or a net-cage 
by adhering to and growing on a fish net with the result that 
streams are prevented and fish suffers from oxygen shortage, and 
when raising aquatic animals under closed environments such as 
in a fish tank or a culture pond, proliferous microalgae grow to 
cause pollution of water for raising aquatic animals or  
 
diseases of them. In addition, the algae which emerge and grow 
on the draft of seacrafts can prevent smooth ship navigation. When raising fish for appreciation in an aquarium or at 
home, the effect of algae is not only pollution of water for 
raising aquatic animals as described but also difficulty in 
removing algae attached and grown on the glass of a fish tank 
and spoiled appearance of the tank. When culturing aquatic animals for studying purposes, the 
growth of microalgae prevents normal growth of aquatic animals 
being cultured, which in turn markedly affects the results of 
the study. Therefore, various algaecides have been studied for 
inhibiting or preventing emergence and growth of algae, and 
quaternary ammonium salts such as benzalkonium chloride and 
chlorine compounds such as sodium hypochlorite have been mainly 
used. Yet, they are not desirable since they are highly toxic 
and harmfully affect aquatic animals. Incidentally, germanium which interrupts intake of silicon 
into cell membranes of diatom to inhibit growth shows a 
preventive effect on the growth of some particularly proliferous 
diatom from among algae (Lewin, J., Phycologia, 6, 1-12 
(1966), and others], and germanium compounds have been starting 
to be employed. While germanium proves effective in preventing
