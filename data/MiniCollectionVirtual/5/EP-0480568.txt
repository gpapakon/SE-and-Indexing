<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photothermographic
materials and in particular to post-processing stabilization
of dry silver systems.Silver halide photothermographic imaging
materials, especially "dry silver" compositions, processed
with heat and without liquid development have been known
in the art for many years. Such materials are a mixture
of light insensitive silver salt of an organic acid (e.g.,
silver behenate), a minor amount of catalytic light
sensitive silver halide, and a reducing agent for the
silver source.The light sensitive silver halide is in
catalytic proximity to the light insensitive silver salt
such that the latent image formed by the irradiation of
the silver halide serves as a catalyst nucleus for the
oxidation-reduction reaction of the organic silver salt
with the reducing agent when heated above 80Â°C. Such
media are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,457,075;
3,839,049; and 4,260,677. Toning agents can be incorporated
to improve the color of the silver image of
photothermographic emulsions as described in U.S. Pat.
Nos. 3,846,136; 3,994,732 and 4,021,249. Various methods
to produce dye images and multicolor images with photographic
color couplers and leuco dyes are well known in
the art as represented by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,022,617;
3,531,286; 3,180,731; 3,761,270; 4,460,681; 4,883,747 and
Research Disclosure 29963. A common problem that exists with these
photothermographic systems is the instability of the image
following processing. The photoactive silver halide still
present in the developed image may continue to catalyze
print-out of metallic silver even during room light
handling. Thus, there exists a need for stabilization of
the unreacted silver halide with the addition of separate
post-processing image stabilizers or stabilizer precursors
to provide the desired post-processing stability. Most
often these are sulfur containing compounds such as
mercaptans, thiones, thioethers as described in Research
disclosure 17029. U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,033 describes
sulfur compounds of the mercapto-type that are development
restrainers of photothermographic systems as do U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,837,141 and 4,451,561. Mesoionic
1,2,4-triazolium-3-thiolates as fixing agents and silver
halide stabilizers are described in U.S. Pat. No.
4,378,424. Substituted 5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazoles such as
3-amino-5-benzothio-1,2,4-triazole as post-processing
stabilizers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,557;
4,137,079; 4,138,265, and Research Disclosure 16977 and
16979.Some of the problems with these stabilizers
include
