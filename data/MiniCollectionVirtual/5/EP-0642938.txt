<ABSTRACT>
The vehicle wheel suspension comprises a wheel carrier (2) supporting the wheel (1), which wheel carrier is connected in the lower area to the vehicle body (8) by way of a transverse link (3) and a compression strut (4). A short wishbone (12), which on the telescopic shock absorber (14) is capable of swivelling with its inner end about a swivel axis running approximately in the vehicle longitudinal direction (F), acts pivotably in the upper area of the wheel carrier. The telescopic shock absorber (14) is surrounded by a coaxial support spring (15), designed as coil spring, and like the support spring (15) is supported at the top on the vehicle body (8). In order to compensate for the bending moments exerted on the shock absorber (14) by the wheel load by way of the upper short wishbone (12), the shock absorber (14) is connected, so that it is capable of swivelling about an axis of rotation (16), to the transverse link (3), which in relation to the shock absorber central axis (17) is offset towards the vehicle centre.

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle wheel suspension with a wheel support (2) bearing the wheel (1), 
which wheel support (2) is connected in its lower region via a joint (9) with 

a transverse arm (3) mounted on the vehicle structure (8) or the like and is 
connected in its upper region via a further joint (11) with a A-frame arm 

(12), which is mounted at its inner region for instance about a longitudinal 
axis in a swivellable manner on a telesopic suspension strut, which 

comprises a shock absorber (14) and a support spring (15) surrounding the 
latter and resting against it, in which the shock absorber (14) is connected 

in a swivellable manner with the transverse arm (3) at the lower end for 
instance about a rotation axis (16) running longitudinally and rests in an 

articulated manner with the upper end against the vehicle structure (8),
 
characterised in that the rotation axis (16) for articulating the shock 

absorber (14) on the transverse arm (3) is staggered relative to the central 
axis (17) of the shock absorber towards the centre of the vehicle. 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 1, in which the transverse arm is 
broken down into an individual rod-shaped transverse arm (3) and into a 

tension or torque arm (4),
 
characterised in that the articulation of the shock absorber (14) is provided 

on the rod-shaped transverse arm (3). 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 2, characterised in that the central 
axis (17) of the shock absorber is staggered in relation to the longitudinal 

axis (18) of the rod-shaped transverse arm (3) in the direction of travel (F). 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 1, characterised in that the line of 
force of the support spring (15) and of the shock absorber (14) coincide.
