a manufacturing method thereof.Fig.26 is a cross-sectional view of a conventional insulated gate
semiconductor device, and a description is made on an insulated gate bipolar
transistor with the trench gate structure (referred to as an IGBT, hereinafter, and an
IGBT with the trench gate structure is referred to as a U-type IGBT) as an
example.Recently, the IGBTs are used in the voltage resonance circuits, which are
high frequency inverters for energy conservation, miniaturization, and weight
reduction of household electric appliances, and used in intelligent power modules
for performing variable speed control of three-phase motors in the fields of the
general purpose inverters, the AC servo, and the air conditioners, etc., and they are
now in general use. In the IGBTs, which are key devices thereof, devices with
good switching characteristic, low saturation voltage and large SOA (Safe Operating
Area) are demanded while the switching characteristic, the saturation voltage and
the SOA are in the trade-off relation. In Fig.26, the reference numeral 1 denotes a P+ collector layer, the reference
numeral 2 denotes an N- layer, the reference numeral 3 denotes a P base layer, the
reference numeral 4 denotes an N+ emitter layer, the reference numeral 5 denotes
a trench, the reference numeral 6 denotes a gate insulating film, the reference
numeral 7 denotes a gate electrode, the reference numeral 8 denotes an interlayer
insulating film, the reference numeral 9 denotes an N+ buffer layer, the reference
numeral 10 denotes an emitter electrode, the reference numeral 11 denotes a
collector electrode, and the reference numeral 12 denotes a channel region.Next, operation of the IGBT will be described.When a certain collector voltage VCE is applied between the emitter electrode
10 and the collector electrode 11 and a certain gate voltage VGE is applied between
the emitter electrode 10 and the gate electrode 7, that is, when the gate is turned
on, the channel region 12 is inverted into the N-type and a channel is formed.
Electrons are injected from the emitter electrode 10 through the channel into the N-
layer 2. The injected electrons establish forward bias between the P+ collector layer
1 and the N- layer 2 and holes are injected from the collector electrode 11 via the
P+ collector layer
