<ABSTRACT>
A remote control system which makes it possible to form groups with respect to transmitters (1) which wirelessly transmit messages and/or with respect to receiving decoders (2) which preferably act on actuators (6). The system operates with decoders (2) which freely definably allocate a key address, oriented in accordance with instruction keys (7), to each received key address by means of memories which can be programmably occupied as allocation table (3). The key addresses are allocated to the actuators (6) at the output side (8).

<CLAIMS>
A remote control system which facilitates grouping 
in respect of transmitters which send wireless messages 

and/or in respect of receiving decoders (2) which 
preferably act on actuators (6) via a wired connection, 

in that by means of stores which are allocatable as 
association tables (3) in programmable fashion the 

decoders (2) cause each received key address, which 
latter is orientated in accordance with command keys 

(7), to be assigned, in a freely definable fashion, one 
or more key addresses on the output side (8) with 

respect to the actuators (6). 
A remote control system as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the key addresses both of the 

transmitters (1) and on the output sides (8) of the 
decoders (2) cooperate with base addresses which, in 

respect of transmitters (1) and decoders (2), correlate 
in accordance with an ordering principle which results 

in a specific assignment by the selection of an ordering 
element. 
A remote control system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the key addresses on the output 

side (8) of the association table (3) are in each case 
assigned, by the place value of the bits, to that output 

whose ordinal number corresponds to the place value. 
A remote control system as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that the base addresses are adjustable 

on each transmitter (1), in particular by a binary 
coding switch. 
A remote control system as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterised in that on the decoder (2) the key address  

 
which is addressed on the input side (9) can be 

indicated by a pointer.
