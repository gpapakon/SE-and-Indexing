<ABSTRACT>
A bearing set for a ball socket joint comprises an 
outer bearing (22) and an inner bearing (24) with a 

head (40) of a ball stud (42) engaging a spherical 
inner seat face (38) of each of the bearings. A 

compression pre-load is applied when the inner bearing 
(24) is inserted into a cavity (32) of the outer 

bearing (22), a cylindrical outer wedge surface (54) of 
the inner bearing (24) having a greater diameter than a 

corresponding diameter of an inner skirt (34) defining 
the cavity (32) of the outer bearing (22). The bearing 

set is subjected to additional compression pre-load 
when the bearing set and ball stud (42) are inserted 

into a socket (30) and the socket (30) is closed. The 
two-piece bearing set promotes easy joint assembly, 

results in a joint that is extremely tight with no 
axial or radial play, but allows necessary ball stud 

rotation and oscillation, and compensates for wear by a 
self-adjusting feature whereby some of the compression 

pre-load is released as wear takes place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ball and socket joint 
assembly for a wide range of applications, comprising a 
two-piece bearing set that engages a head of a ball stud when 
retained within a socket under a compression pre-load. Ball and socket joints are used in a variety of 
applications, including rack and pinion inner tie rod socket 
assemblies, steering knuckles, drag links, and connecting rod 
assemblies. Such joints typically include a cylindrical 
socket member adapted to receive a bearing together with a 
head of a ball stud. The bearing reduces the amount of 
friction between the socket and the head of the ball stud 
while frequently adapting for looseness between the stud and 
socket members resulting from wear. Such joints have been subject to many disadvantages, 
however. Assembly is difficult. Typically, the stud head must 
be forced into the bearing, and in turn the bearing forced 
into the socket. Cracked bearings result during assembly, 
particularly when very rigid, stiff, inelastic materials are 
used. To reduce such cracks, slots are often required within 
the bearing itself. Load distribution on such slotted 
bearings during operation typically results in undesirable 
wear between the various components. Further, the bearings of 
such joints can adapt for only limited wear, resulting in 
joint failure as stud head rotating torque decreases and axial 
end play increases. EP-A-342351 describes a bearing set, a ball and socket 
joint and a method for making a ball and socket joint as set out in the pre-characterising portion of claims 1, 6 
and 20 respectively. According to a first aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a bearing set for a ball and socket joint 
comprising: 
an outer bearing, said outer bearing including a first 
spherical inner seat face and a generally cylindrical inner 
skirt defining a cavity, extending axially about an axis of  
 
symmetry; and an inner bearing including a second spherical inner 
seat face and a generally cylindrical outer wedge surface, a 
diameter of said outer wedge surface being greater than a 
corresponding diameter of said inner skirt such that a 
pre-load results between said inner and outer bearings when 
said inner bearing is forced into said cavity of said outer 
bearing. According to a second aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a ball and socket joint comprising: 
a socket; an outer bearing disposed within said socket, said 
outer bearing including an outer surface adapted to conform to 
an inner surface
