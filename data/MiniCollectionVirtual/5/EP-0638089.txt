<ABSTRACT>
A new technique for generating mixtures of oligonucleotides in a single automated synthesis is taught. The method can be used to prepare mixed oligonucleotides ideally suited for creation of useful mixtures of oligo- or polypeptides or proteins. Additionally, the technique enables insertion and/or substitution and/or deletion of a nucleotide sequence at one or more sites. For protein mutagenesis, a trinucleotide can be inserted or substituted at codon boundaries. The invented technique makes possible the encoding of all possible single amino acid insertions, or any desired mixture of substitutions and insertions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the synthesis of oligonucleotides, and specifically a new method for generating mixtures of oligonucleotides in a single automated synthesis. The technique enables the generation of diverse mixtures of DNA which can be used to prepare large collections of oligo- or polypeptides and/or proteins.Methods of preparing DNA of mixed composition are becoming increasingly important in the study of biomolecular function as well as in the search for substances with new and useful properties. As DNA synthesis technology improved in the early 1980's, it became feasible to perform multiple syntheses as a means of generating mixtures of oligonucleotides. In principle, large and diverse collections could be made in multiple syntheses. In practice, several investigators realized that large numbers of oligonucleotides could be generated in a single synthesis by coupling mixtures of mononucleotides, instead of unique monomer building blocks. The complexity of the resulting collection or "library" of oligonucleotides is determined by the number of monomers coupled, and the number of sites at which mixtures of monomers are introduced.Oligonucleotides of mixed composition are increasingly being used in protein mutagenesis for the study of structure and function. By expressing DNA sequences of mixed composition, a corresponding library of mutant proteins is generated. Allied with appropriate screening techniques, such libraries can be searched for substances with altered properties, and are therefore useful in the study of biomolecular function. The most general class of mutagenesis methods employs oligonucleotides based on the sequence of the wild-type gene, and incorporating modifications that will eventually give rise to any desired amino acid sequence changes. These methods were recently reviewed in the August 1991 issue of Current Opinion in Structural Biology.Virtually all genetic studies of protein structure and activity employ substitution mutations: one or several amino acid side chains are replaced, but the length of the protein and the spacing of residues are conserved. In order to facilitate the generation of large numbers of substitution mutations in a single experiment, a number of prior art techniques have been developed (for review, see Botstein, D. & Shortle, D. (1985) Science 229, 1193-1201 and Zoller, M. J. (1991) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1, 605-610), the most popular of which involve the chemical synthesis of complex mixtures of oligonucleotides which are used either as

A method for inserting a trinucleotide sequence at one or more codon boundaries during the chemical synthesis of DNA, said method comprising the steps of:

(a) sub-stoichiometric coupling of a trinucleotide sequence bearing a 3'-phosphoramidite, and a 5'-protecting group that is cleaved under the conditions used to remove the 5'-protecting groups of monomer building blocks,
(b) cleaving all 5'-protecting groups,
(c) continuing DNA synthesis by coupling of either monomers or additional trinucleotide sequences.
