<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODSThis invention relates to a method of preventing or delaying the occurrence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive humans which comprises administering to such human an effective therefore amount of a substituted azaspirane.Background of the InventionThe use of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents has been shown to suppress viral replication.Specifically, immunomodulating CD8 lymphocytes have been shown to suppress replication of HIV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Waler et al. Science, 2-21:1563-6 (1986)) and activated CD8+ T cells have been shown to inhibit the replication of HIV in cultures of CD4+ cells from asymptomatic HIV seropositive individuals (Brinch ann et al. CD8+ T cells J. Immunol. 144 2961-2966 (1990)). Further, the immunosuppressive compound cyclosporin A (CsA) has demonstrated a protective effect in several animal models of viral infection. Particularly, chronic treatment with CsA before and after infection with LP-B 5 murine leukemia virus has proven effective against the development of immunodeficiency disease (Cerny, A. et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 21:1747-50 (1991)). Evidence that treatment 

of AIDS and HIV-seroposi ive non-AIDS patients with CsA increases T4 cells and inhibits lymphadenopathy has also been reported. (Andrieu et al. Clin. Immunol, and immnmopathol . 46:181-198 (1988)) .Badger, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,963,557 (Badger I) discloses compounds of the formulawherein: n is 3-7; m is 1 or 2; R^ and R^ are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen or straight or branched chain alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms contained by R^ and R^ when taken together is 5-10; or R?- and R2 together form a cyclic alkyl group having 3-7 carbon atoms; R^ and R^ are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen or straight chain alkyl having 1-3 carbon atoms; or R3 and R^ are joined together with the nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic group having 5-8 atoms; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate or solvate thereof.Badger I discloses compounds of Formula I as a novel class of compounds which induce an immunomodulatory effect which is characterized by the stimulation of suppressor cell activity.Badger I does not disclose the compounds of Formula I as agents for preventing or delaying the occurrence of AIDS in HIV seropositive humans. 

 Summary of the Invention This invention relates to a method of preventing or delaying the occurrence of AIDS in HIV seropositive humans
