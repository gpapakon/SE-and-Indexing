Dental tooth-cleaning instrument (1) with an elongated
handpiece which bears at its front end a tooth-cleaning

tool (3) that is capable of being caused to
vibrate by a motor-driven vibration generator (7)

assigned to the tooth-cleaning instrument (1), said
tooth-cleaning tool (3) comprising several wires (31)

arranged side by side, the points of which are
situated in a working surface (29) and which consist

of a material that is capable of eroding a tooth
deposit or a staining of the tooth surface by virtue

of the vibrating movement, said tooth-cleaning
instrument (1) being connected or capable of being

detachably connected to a supply hose (6) comprising
power lines and/or media lines,
characterised in that

the wires (31) consist of elastic synthetic material,
are juxtaposed in the form of a bundle of wires and

are received and secured in a pot-shaped tool head
(17) which is detachably connected to a support

pertaining to the tooth-cleaning tool (3).
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 1,
characterised in that

the working surface (29) is plane or curved or extends
radially with respect to the longitudinal centre axis

(28) of the tool head (18).
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that

the wires have a cross-sectional dimension from about
0.02 mm to 0.2 mm.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

the wires have a cross-sectional dimension from about
0.05 mm to 0.08 mm. 
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

the support is a shank (23) projecting from the
handpiece.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 5,
characterised in that

the shank (23) is of tubular construction.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that

the tool head (17) is bent by an acute angle (W) with
respect to the bottom end of the shank (23).
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 7,
characterised in that

the angle (W) amounts to about 30° to 60°.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 8,
characterised in that

the angle (W) amounts to about 45°.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

several tool heads (17) are provided with wires (31)
which can optionally be connected to the support.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

an illuminating device directed towards the tool head
(17) or towards the treatment surface is assigned to

said instrument. 
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 11,
characterised in that

the illuminating device comprises an optical waveguide
(11) with a surface for egress of light at the front

end of the handpiece.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

a rinsing and/or cooling device having an exit
aperture (35a) for the rinsing and/or cooling medium

directed towards the tool head (17) or towards the
treatment site is assigned to said instrument.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

a channel (24, 25) for a rinsing and/or cooling medium
extends in the rear region of the tooth-cleaning tool

(3) or over the entire length thereof, the orifice of
said channel being directed towards the treatment

site.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 14,
characterised in that

the channel (25) extends through the bundle of wires.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

the tooth-cleaning tool (3) is detachably connected to
the handpiece.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to Claim 16,
characterised in that

several tooth-cleaning tools (3) of differing 
materials, hardness, shape, rating (coarse, fine)

and/or size are provided which can optionally be
connected to the handpiece.
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

the handpiece is capable of being detachably connected
to a connecting piece (5) by means of a plug-in/rotating

coupling (4).
Tooth-cleaning instrument according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterised in that

the amplitudes of vibration of the tooth-cleaning tool
(3) are directed along and/or transverse to the

longitudinal centre axis of the handpiece.
