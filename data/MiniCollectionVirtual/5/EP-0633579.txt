<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved pinless connector for 
use in microelectronics having an elastomer resin comprising 

polysiloxane and filler. In particular the elastomer resin has a 

tensile strength greater than 170 psi and comprises (i) a crosslinked 
polysiloxane comprising about 70 to 90 weight % of a crosslinked random 

copolymer of dimethylsiloxane and diphenylsiloxane and (ii) about 10 to 
30 weight % of filler comprising zinc oxide and a lanthanide oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved pinless connector for
use in microelectronics and in particular relates to a pinless connector
comprising an improved elastomer.In the manufacture of circuit assemblies for large computers, a
plurality of integrated circuits such as semiconductor chips are
generally mounted on a multichip module. A multichip module is an
intermediate level of packaging between the chips and the circuit board.
Multichip modules are made up of a plurality of insulating and conducting
layers wherein the conducting, power, signal and ground layers deliver
power to the chips and distribute the input/output signals between chips
on the module or to/from the circuit board. Multichip modules typically
contain input/output pins on the bottom surface for connection to the
circuit board. However, in some cases, the pin connection between the
module and the circuit board are unsuitable for high frequency
applications due to the high inductance and capacitance coupling
generally caused by the longer pin length.In order to overcome this problem, pinless elastomeric connectors
also known as interposer connectors were developed. Pinless connectors
generally comprise conductive particles or fine wires embedded in an
elastomeric material. The preferred pinless connector comprises a
multitude of spaced apart fine wires embedded in an elastomeric material.
The wires extend through the material to opposite surfaces of the
material. The pinless connector is sandwiched and compressed between two
mated electronic components such as a module and circuit board to provide
electrical contact.Prior pinless connectors utilized silicon rubber as the elastomeric
material for the connector. However, the silicon rubber experiences
thermal degradation during use which can result in reliability problems.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
pinless connector comprising an improved elastomer. Other objects and
advantages will become apparent from the following disclosure.The present invention relates to an electrical connector and
process for making the connector. The connector comprises a dielectric 
composition having a first and second opposing surfaces and a plurality
of electrically conducting wires extending from the first to the second
opposing surface of the electrical connector, the connector being
characterised in that the dielectric composition comprises a crosslinked
polysiloxane having a high tensile strength greater than 1.172x106 Nm-2
(about 170 psi). The connector is
