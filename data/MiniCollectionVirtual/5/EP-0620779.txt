<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a retruder (re-verse ex-truder) (1) having at least one housing, feed (10) and discharge sites (11) and at least two meshing reverse worms (2, 3) that move in opposite directions (12, 13), moving the medium in advance (14) and reverse directions (15) simultaneously. Because the reversal of thrust reduces the axial bearing load of the reverse worms (2, 3) and the compression on the bearing gaskets, such machines permit increased feed pressure and greater frictional forces over worm extruders and other extrusion devices, without diminishing durability or service quality.

<CLAIMS>
Retruder for the continuous mixing and kneading of
media under increased pressure, comprising a drive

and at least one casing, and at least two
counterrotating (12, 13), intermeshing reversing

screws (2, 3) which move the medium in the conveying
direction (14) and in the reverse direction (15) such

that the medium is transported from the loading point
(10) to the discharge point (11) of the casing, which

is disposed vertically to the conveying direction
14).
Retruder according to claim 1, characterised by the
fact that the flank pitch (4) of the rev
ersing screws
(2, 3) is progressively degressive according to the

conveying direction (14, 15).
Retruder according to claims 1 and 2, characterised
by the fact that the reversing screws (2, 3) are of

one piece, monobloc construction.
Retruder according to claims 1 to 3, characterised by
the fact that the pitch (5) of the reversing screws

(2, 3) is different in the conveying direction (14)
and in the reversing direction (15). 
Retruder according to claims 1 to 4, characterised by
the fact that the raversing screws (2, 3) are

supported in bearings on only one side in the casing
(6).
Retruder according to claims 1 to 5, characterised by
the fact that the reversing screws (2, 3) are

supported in bearings on both sides in the casing
(6).
Retruder according to claims 1 to 6, characterised by
the fact that the width of the screw channel of the

reversing screws (2, 3) narrows progressively in the
conveying direction.
Retruder according to claims 1 to 7 characterised by
the fact that least one cooling jacket.
Retruder according to claims 1 to 8 characterised by
the fact that the casing (6) has at least one heating

jacket.
Retruder according to claims 1 to 9, characterised by
the fact that the drive of the counter-rotating

reversing screws (2, 3) is steplessly variable.
