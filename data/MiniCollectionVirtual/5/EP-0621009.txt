<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a minimally invasive surgical 
instrument comprising an elongate tubular section including a 

tubular portion (10) and an end effector mount (424) having first (420) 
and second (422) 

mount portions and a wrist mechanism (410) associated with the first 
and second mount portions for permitting adjustment of the 

angular orientation of the first mount portion relative to the 
second mount portion. The tubular portion is pivotably connected 

to a proximal end of the second mount portion. First and second 
end effectors (60,70) are further provided and are pivotably connected to 

a distal end of the first mount portion. Also provided is an 
actuator mechanism connected to the first and second end 

effectors for effecting pivotable movement of the first and 
second end effectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. 
Application Serial No. 07/959,017, filed October 9, 1992, and 
entitled "Rotational Endoscopic Mechanism with Jointed Drive 
Mechanism", (see EP-A-592 243 document under Art. 54(3) EPC). Generally, this invention relates to minimally invasive 
surgical instruments. More particularly, this invention relates 
to minimally invasive surgical instruments having end effectors 
such as graspers, dissectors, and scissors. Most specifically, 
this invention relates to minimally invasive surgical instruments 
having an elongate tubular portion pivotably connected to an end 
effector portion, wherein the latter includes first and second 
end effectors and an end effector mount having first and second 
mount portions and a wrist mechanism associated with the first 
and second mount portions for permitting adjustment of the 
angular position of the first mount portion relative to the 
second mount portion. Within minimally invasive surgery, there is a 
recognized need for simple devices such as graspers, dissectors, 
scissors, and other basic surgical instruments. These 
instruments are necessary in order to perform simple functions 
during surgical procedures. Specifically, devices such as 
graspers are necessary in order to properly clear the work site 
so that the tissue to be worked on may be isolated and surgery 
may be performed. Scissors may be needed in order to make an 
appropriate cut in tissue. Dissectors can be necessary to 
separate one portion of tissue from another. These instruments 
also enable other, larger instruments, such as staplers and 
ligating clip appliers, to have sufficient volumetric room to  
 
perform effectively during procedures such as appendectomies, 
cholecystectomies, herniorrhaphies, etc. Traditionally, minimally invasive surgical instruments 
such as graspers, dissectors, scissors and the like have been 
mounted on generally straight shafts. These shafts may or may 
not have been able to rotate about their longitudinal axes. 
Nonetheless, there has been perceived a need for the end effector 
portion of the shaft to be able to angulate with respect to the 
longitudinal axis of the shaft. This would enable the surgeon to 
attack tissue to be operated upon from an oblique angle. In 
fact, it may be desirable to have the shaft angulate up to 90° 
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the shaft. In many 
ways, this function can be analogized to the capability of the 
human hand to rotate around the "axis" of the arm, and also 
"angulate" about
