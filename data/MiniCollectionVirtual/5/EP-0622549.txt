<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal compressor comprises a centrifugal 
impeller (2) and a vaned diffuser (7). The diffuser (7) 

includes a pair of diffuser plates (3,4) and a plurality of 
guide vanes (5,6) arranged between the pair of diffuser plates (3,4) 

in a circular cascade manner. The guide vanes (5,6) are equal 
in leading-edge radius to each other, but are different 

in length from each other. At least one short guide 
vane (6) is arranged between the adjacent long guide vanes (5). 

The total number of the guide vanes (5,6) is more than the 
number of blades (13) of the impeller (2). A throat (10) is formed in 

only a part of flow passages between the guide vanes (5,6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a centrifugal compressor comprising a 
centrifugal impeller and a vaned diffuser arrangend downstream 
of said impeller, said vaned diffuser including a pair of 
diffuser plates and a plurality of guide vanes arranged between 
said pair of diffuser plates in a circular cascade manner, 
said circular cascade of said vaned diffuser comprising 
an inner circular cascade and an outer circular cascade, 
wherein the leading-edge radius of the guide vanes of the 
outer circular cascade is substantially the same in level as 
the trailing-edge radius of the guide vanes of the inner 
circular cascade.  
 In centrifugal compressors, conventionally a 
vaned diffuser has been often used when high efficiency 
is required. These are disclosed in Japanese Utility 
Model Examined Publication No. 63-45599 and the like, 
for example. In such centrifugal compressor having the 
vaned diffuser, flow of fluid is guided by auide vanes 
so that flow angle measured from a tangential direction 
increases, and the flow of fluid is turned into a radial 
direction. Thus, the flow is efficiently decelerated. 
In this manner, performance of the centrifugal 
compressor having the vaned diffuser generally increases 
in efficiency, as compared with a case of a vaneless 
diffuser. In the vaned diffuser, however, throats are 
generally formed or defined respectively in passages 
between the adjoining guide vanes. Accordingly, choke 
occurs at large flow rate, and deceleration from a 
diffuser inlet to the throat increases at low flow rate 
so that the flow stalls and surge occurs. Thus, the 
prior art has a problem that operating range of 
compressor having the vaned diffuser is less than that  
 
of compressor having the vaneless diffuser. Further, 
flow of the fluid at an impeller outlet of the 
centrifugal compressor is non-uniform or uneven in a 
peripheral direction, that is, in a vane pitch 
direction. Accordingly, periodically fluctuating flow 
enters into the diffuser. Frequency of the fluctuating 
flow is equal to blade passage frequency of the 
impeller, that is, (the number of blades of the 
impeller) x (rotational frequency). Accordingly, since 
the fluctuating flow impinges against the guide vanes of 
the diffuser, compressor with the vaned diffuser has a 
problem that high noise which prevails by a blade 
passage frequency component is generated as compared 
with compressor with the vaneless diffuser. Moreover, in order to solve the problem that 
the operating range of compressor having the vaned 
diff
