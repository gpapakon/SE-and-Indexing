<ABSTRACT>
A container comprises a base (10) and a peripheral wall 
(12) which define an upwardly-open containing space (14) 

and at least one partition (18) for dividing the 
containing space (14) adapted to be inserted in and 

removed from the containing space (14). The container 
further includes a base panel (16) adapted to be located 

removably on the base (10) and having a plurality of 
seats, preferably grooves (24), in its face opposite the 

base (10), it being possible to insert the lower edge of 
the at least one partition (18) in the seats.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container of the type 
comprising a base and a peripheral wall which define an 
upwardly-open containing space, and at least one 
partition for dividing the containing space adapted to be 
inserted in and removed from the containing space. Known containers of the type mentioned above usually 
include a plurality of partitions which may be located 
within the containing space in several predetermined 
arrangements so as to allow the subdivision of the space 
to be varied according to the type of object to be 
contained therein. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
container of the type indicated above in which the 
positioning of the partitions in the containing space is 
facilitated and made quicker. This object is achieved by virtue of a container of the 
type indicated above, characterised in that it includes 
a base panel intended to be located removably on the base 
and having, on its face opposite the base, a plurality of 
seats, preferably grooves, in which the lower edge of the 
at least one partition can be inserted. The grooves formed in the base panel of the container of  
 
the invention constitute reference guides for the lower 
edges of the partitions, facilitating their quick 
location in the space in the desired configuration. The presence of the base panel has the further advantage 
of stiffening the structure of the container so as to 
extend its use to containing heavier objects. The panel, which is the part of the container most likely 
to be soiled, being removable, may also facilitate 
washing, disinfection and the like. The container is 
thus more versatile in use and may be used to contain 
dirty objects without compromising its subsequent use for 
containing clean objects. Further advantages and characteristics of the present 
invention will become clear from the detailed description 
which follows, provided purely by way of non-limitative 
example, with reference to the appended drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the container of 
the invention in an assembled configuration, and Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the 
container of Figure 1. A container comprises a base 10 and a peripheral wall 12 
which define an upwardly-open containing space 14, a base 
panel 16 and a plurality of partitions 18a, 18b for  
 
dividing the containing space 14 and which can be 
inserted in and removed from the latter. The base 10 is rectangular while the peripheral wall 12 
is formed by four rectangular elements 20a,

<CLAIMS>
A container comprising a base (10) and a peripheral 
wall (12) which define an upwardly-open containing space 

(14), and at least one partition (18) for dividing the 
containing space (14) and adapted to be inserted in and 

removed from the containing space (14), the container 
being characterised in that it includes a base panel (16) 

intended to be located removably on the base (10) and 
having, on its face opposite the base (10), a plurality 

of seats, preferably grooves (24), in which the lower 
edge of the at least one partition (18) can be inserted. 
A container according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a plurality of holes (28) is formed in the base 

panel (16) for facilitating the positioning of objects in 
the containing space (14). 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the base (10) is 

rectangular and the peripheral wall (12) is formed by 
four rectangular elements arranged in facing pairs (20a, 

20b; 22a, 22b) which project upwardly each from a 
respective edge of the base (10), and in that the base 

panel (16) is rectangular and, on its face opposite the 
base (10), has a grid of intersecting grooves (24) 

oriented in two principle mutually-perpendicular 
directions parallel to respective edges of the panel (16). 
A container according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the intersecting grooves (24) divide the face of the 

panel (16) opposite the base (10) into a plurality of 
square compartments (26) in each of which there is a 

respective hole (28). 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
Claims 3 or 4, characterised in that it includes two sets 

of rectangular partitions (18a, 18b) of different 
dimensions corresponding respectively to those of the 

pairs of elements (20a, 20b; 22a, 22b) constituting the 
side walls (12) and intended to be positioned parallel to 

the elements (20a, 20b; 22a, 22b) of the side wall (12) 
of the corresponding dimension, the partitions (18a, 18b) 

of each set having a plurality of equispaced slots (30) 
extending from the edge intended to face the partitions 

(18b, 18a) of the other set so as to allow the 
interpenetration of the partitions (18a, 18b) of the two 

sets. 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the base (10), the 

peripheral wall (12), the partitions (18a, 18b) and the 
base panel (16) are made of plastics material. 
A container according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it comprises a second panel used as a lid 

of the container.
