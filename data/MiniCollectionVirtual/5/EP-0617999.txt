<ABSTRACT>
A mixer (2) is provided with a comminution device (4) whose operating head (5) is arranged in the interior (3) and whose motor (6) is arranged outside the interior (3). Between the motor (6) and the operating head (5), a magnetic coupling (9) is arranged outside the interior (3), its drive head (11) being coupled to the motor (6) and its driven rotor (22) being coupled to the operating head (5). A split pot (25) which surrounds the rotor (22) in a gas-tight and liquid-tight manner is arranged between the drive head (11) and the rotor (22). The coupling output-drive shaft (15), which connects the rotor (22) to the operating head (5), is passed through a sliding-ring seal (33) which is located in the container wall (1). The barrier liquid which is used for sealing it is passed through the interior (34) of the split pot (25).

Mixer with a container wall (1) surrounding an internal 
chamber (3), with a rotatable mixing device arranged in the 

internal chamber (3) and with a crushing system (4) which has 
a working head (5) arranged in the internal chamber (3) of the 

mixer (2) and is rotatably connected to an electric motor (6) 
arranged outside the internal chamber (3) of the mixer (2), 

wherein a shaft (15) which is rotationally engaged with the 
working head (5) and penetrates a recess (32) formed in the 

container wall (1) and provided with a seal (33) is coupled to 
an output shaft (10) of the motor (6), characterised in that 

between the output shaft (10) of the motor (6) and the shaft 
(15) driving the working head (5) and outside the internal 

chamber (3) of the mixer (2) there is provided a magnetic 
clutch (9) having a driving head (11) which is coupled to the 

output shaft (10) of the motor (6) and is provided with 
permanent magnets (14) on an internal wall (12) and having a 

rotor (22) which is arranged in a driving head (11), is 
provided, on an external wall (22a), with permanent magnets 

(23) allocated to the permanent magnets (14) of the driving 
head (11) and is rotationally engaged with a clutch output 

shaft (15) coupled to the driving head (5), in that a split 
pot (25) penetrating an air gap (24) between the permanent 

magnets (14, 23) and surrounding the rotor (22) in a gas-tight 
and liquid-tight manner is provided, in that the seal located 

in the recess (32) is designed as a simply acting sliding ring 
seal (33) which is open toward the internal chamber (34) of 

the split pot (25) and is connected to a barrier fluid supply 
duct (35) on its side remote from the internal chamber (3) of 

the mixer (2) and in that a barrier fluid discharge duct (36) 
issuing from the internal chamber (34) of the split pot (25) 

is provided. 
Mixer according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
rotor (22) with the clutch output shaft (15) is mounted freely 

rotatably and axially unmovably in a bearing (16) arranged 
within the split pot (25).  

 
Mixer according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
bearing (16) is designed as a sliding bearing. 
Mixer according to claims 1 and 3, characterised in that 
the sliding faces of the sliding bearing are connected to the 

internal chamber (34) of the split pot (25) by lubricating 
ducts (38). 
Mixer according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the barrier fluid supply duct (35) and the barrier fluid 

discharge duct (36) are contained in a closed barrier fluid 
circuit.
