<ABSTRACT>
A method of gas distribution in a four-stroke 
internal combustion engine with phase regulation and a 

device for its implementation are intended for ensuring 
optimal phases of gas distribution under all speed 

working conditions of the engine and thus increasing its 
power-economic and dynamic characteristics. The phase 

regulation is effected by means of angular shift of the 
camshafts (1, 2) in relation to the crankshaft (10), 

whereas in case of increase of rotation speed one 
camshaft (1) is shifted in the direction of its rotation and 

the other camshaft (2) against the direction of its 
rotation. A mechanism for gas distribution in a four-stroke 

internal combustion engine with phase regulation 
comprises two camshafts (1, 2) controlling the inlet (3, 4) 

and outlet (5, 6) valves by means of cams, and further 
comprises a device for angular shifting of the camshafts 

(1, 2) in relation to the crankshaft (10) by means of 
influencing a driving-element (7) with actuating 

mechanisms (15, 16) interconnected through a control 
unit (14) and provided with rollers (11, 12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to mechanical engineering namely 
to a method of gas distribuion in a four-stroke internal-combustion 
engine with phase regulation and a mechanism for 
realization thereof. It is known a mechanism of gas distribution in a four-stroke 
internal-combustion engine with changeable phases 
(SU Application No 1634809), containing a disk valve with 
springs and pusher, a hollow can shaft with two cams for 
each valve which provide phases of gas distribution. In the 
shutting-off state one cam is connected with the shaft 
through the torsion spring with possibility a relative angular 
shift, and in the engaged state through the rigid connection 
coupling which is carried out as a whole together with 
the cams of the cam shaft. Another cam is fastened on the 
shaft fixed. At the low rotation frequency phase diagram of gas distribution 
in the engine is defined by an action of fixed cam, 
and controllable cam makes small angular oscillations in relation 
to fixed cam (rotating by this together with the cam 
shaft) which are effected by a difference of these cam profiles. 
At the high rotation frequency fixed connection of 
controllable cam with the fixed cam and hence with the cam 
shaft is obtained. From this moment phase diagram of gas distribution 
in the engine is defined by the controllable cam 
which has more "full" profile than the fixed cam. Regulation of the gas distribution phases by this method 
can provide optimum duration of the phases for two speed modes  
 
of the engine action only, but at the rest range of the 
rotation frequencies a duration of the phases of gas distribution 
will not be optimum, and in these modes the engine 
power and hence dynamic characteristics will not reach their 
maximum values. To the shortcomings of said mechanism should be refered: 
sharp increasing of the specific pressure at the areas of 
the primary contact of the cam connecting elements in the moment 
of the switching, what will result in their speeded up 
wear, complicacy of the design because of the presence of the 
elements which demand particular attention during their manufacturing 
and handling in particular fixation of the springs 
on the controlling rod and the fixed cams on the cam shaft 
(particularly in the multi-cylinder engines), interaction of 
the controllable cam with the movable bush and with the 
spring which fastens it on the cam shaft, considerable remoteness 
of the spot of the cam contact from the valve axis. 
The above-mentioned shortcomings essentially decrease
