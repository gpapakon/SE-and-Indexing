throat (38) and adapted to send 
out the scraps (13) in the heat 

exchanger (39) to the raw material 
inlet port (37), the scraps being 

supplied substantially continuously 
to the furnace body 

(2) as they are preheated with 
a high-temperature exhaust gas 

from the furnace body (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for preheating scrap
or pig iron in the form of cold block (hereinafter referred to as scrap
material) and continuously charging the same into a melting furnace.In order to melt the scrap material, there have been used electric
melting furnaces such as DC or AC arc furnace or non-electrode type
melting furnaces in which the scrap material is charged into a furnace
shell preliminarily charged with molten steel and oxygen O2 and fuel
such as oil or coal are fed to the furnace shell to burn the fuel,
thereby heating and melting the scrap material.Conventionally, a furnace roof is opened when scrap material is to
be charged into a melting furnace of the type described above.Fig. 1 schematically illustrates a conventional melting furnace in
the form of a DC arc furnace which comprises a furnace shell 2 with a
bottom electrode 1 (anode) at its bottom, a furnace roof 3 for
selectively opening and closing an upper opening of the furnace shell 2,
an upper electrode 4 (cathode) vertically extending through the roof 3
coaxially of the latter, an exhaust duct 5 connected to the roof 3, a
roof opening-and-closing device 6 which supports the roof 3 for vertical
and pivotal movements of the latter and an electrode rising-and-lowering
device 7 mounted on the roof opening-and-closing device 6 for vertically
moving the upper electrode 4. The furnace shell 2 is rockably supported
by a lower supporting stand 8 through a curved rocker 9. When the
furnace shell 2 is tilted in the direction perpendicular to the Figure, 
molten steel 10 in the furnace shell 2 is poured through a spout (not
shown) into a ladle 12 on a carriage 11.A material preheating device (not shown) installed separately from
the furnace shell 2 receives high-temperature exhaust gases from the
shell 2 through the exhaust duct 5 to preheat the scrap material, the
exhaust duct 5 being midway provided with combustion cylinder means (not
shown) for complete combustion of unburned CO gas. The scrap material
13 which has been preheated by the material preheating device is charged
at the top of the furnace shell 2 with the roof 3 being opened, using a
bucket or the like.More particularly, in a melting operation of the scrap material
13, the roof opening-and-closing device 6 lifts up the roof 3 and swing
it outwardly to open the top of the furnace shell 2. Using a bucket or
the like, the scrap material 13 which has been preheated by the
preheating device are charged into the furnace shell 2. Then, the top
of the furnace
