<ABSTRACT>
A jamb bracket (10, 40) and track (30, 60) assembly for the support of overhead sectional doors and the like. The assembly comprises bracket means (10, 40) having tab means (20, 50) and track means (30, 60) having tab slots (34, 74). The tab means (20, 40) engage the tab slots (34, 74) for attachment of the bracket means (10, 40) to the track means (30, 60). A related jamb bracket (10, 40) comprises a U-shaped main body (14, 44), providing first and second perpendicularly disposed legs (16, 46 and 18, 48) and, tab means (30, 60) offset from the main body (14, 44).

<DESCRIPTION>
 JAMB BRACKET AND TRACK ASSEMBLY FOR SECTIONALOVERHEAD DOORSTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is directed toward jamb brackets and track assemblies for sectional overhead doors and the like. Each jamb bracket engages the track member and is in turn attached to the door jamb. The jamb bracket holds the track in a fixed position relative to the door so that the door may roll freely in the track. Such assemblies are typically used in conjunction with overhead sectional garage doors in both residential and commercial settings.BACKGROUND ARTTypically, jamb brackets are manufactured in a single piece from heavy angle iron or from stamped angles and flat stock, which must be fastened together with screws or rivets. Heavy material thicknesses are required with such brackets to provide the necessary strength. Attachment of the track to the jamb bracket has previously been accomplished by flat or round head bolts and nuts. Such bolts must be adjusted precisely in order to ensure adequate clearance for the door rollers1 in the track.Despite the years that jamb brackets and track assemblies have been employed and the various design variations, assembly and installation time as well as manufacturing costs can be significant. Installation and assembly involving numerous elements and fasteners is tedious and requires multiple adjustments to ensure smooth operation of the door.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a jamb bracket whereby a track member can be mounted to a door jamb.It is another object of the present invention to provide a jamb bracket and track member which can be manufactured from thin gauge material, yet still provide adequate strength. 

 It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a jamb bracket and track member which can be easily connected without the need for tools or separate fasteners.It is still another object of the present invention to provide a jamb bracket and track member which can be inexpensively manufactured using commonly available materials and conventional manufacturing techniques.At least one or more of the foregoing objects, together with the advantages thereof over known jamb brackets and track assemblies, which shall become apparent from the specification which follows, are accomplished by the invention as hereinafter described and claimed.In general, a jamb bracket and track assembly for the support of sectional overhead doors and the like comprises bracket means having tab means and track means having tab

CLAIMS
What is claimed is: 1. A jamb bracket and track assembly for the support of sectional overhead doors and the like comprising: bracket means having at least one tab means; and track means having at least one tab slot, said tab means being engagable with said tab slot for attachment of said bracket means to said track means.
2. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 1, wherein said tab slot of said track means is generally circular and is interrupted by rectangular notches and flared stops.
3. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 2, wherein said tab means includes first and second arms and ears extending perpendicularly therefrom.
4. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 3, wherein said tab means is inserted into said tab slots and said bracket means is rotated with respect to said track means.
5. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 3, wherein said ears frictionally engage said track member and said first and second arms frictionally engage said tab slot.
6. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 5, wherein said ears engage said flared stop.
7. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 1, wherein said tab slot of said track means is generally circular and is interrupted by opposed semi-circles and flared stops. 


8. A jamb bracket and track assembly, as set forth in claim 7, wherein said tab means includes first and second arms, joined along a common edge to form a saddle, and ears extending perpendicularly therefrom.
9. A jamb bracket comprising: main body means having a U-shaped cross-section providing first and second perpendicularly disposed legs; and tab means offset from said body means.
10. A jamb bracket, as set forth in claim 9, wherein said tab means comprises first and second arms, extending perpendicularly from said body, and ears extending perpendicularly therefrom and parallel to said body.
11. A jamb bracket, as set forth in claim 10, wherein said first and second arms are arcuate.
12. A jamb bracket, as set forth in claim 9, wherein said first and second legs include oblong apertures.
13. A jamb bracket, as set forth in claim 9, wherein said tab means comprises first and second arms, joined along a common edge to form a saddle, and ears extending perpendicularly therefrom and parallel to said body.
