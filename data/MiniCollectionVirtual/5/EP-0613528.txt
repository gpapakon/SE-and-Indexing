<CLAIMS>
A pump for conveying a fluid, having 

- a conveying device (3) housed in a pump housing, 
- a supply channel (33) for the fluid extending in the pump housing, 
- a regulating valve arranged between a pressure region and a suction region (27) of the 
conveying device (3), and having 
- an injector (53) which can be acted upon by fluid under high pressure and which 
conveys fluid from the supply channel (33) into the suction region (27) of the conveying 

device (3), the basic body (55) of the injector (53) being surrounded by an annular 
channel (67) connected to the supply channel (33), and a securing element in the form of 

a mounting sleeve (73) being associated with the injector (53), which securing element is 
supported on the one hand in the basic housing (5) of the pump (1) and on the other hand 

on the injector (53). 
A pump in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the ratios a:b:c = 
3.7:2.3:1 are selected for the diameter a of the annular channel (67), the diameter b 

of the channel portion (37), the diameter c of the outlet and/or the ratios d:e:f= 
1.6:0.85:1.1 are selected for a free stretch d of the stream flowing through the 

injector (53), part of the length e of the injector and for the height f of the annular 
channel (67), the value c = 1 being selected as the base. 
A pump in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the mounting sleeve 
(73) has an anchoring ring (75) which can be anchored in the housing (5) of the 

pump (1) and from which there issue struts (77) supported on the injector (53), 
preferably on its collar (71). 
A pump in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that the mounting sleeve (73) 
has two struts (77) issuing from the anchoring ring (75). 
A pump in accordance with Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the struts (77) are 

arranged in such a manner that the fluid sucked in by the pump can flow 
unhindered into the interior of the mounting sleeve (73).
