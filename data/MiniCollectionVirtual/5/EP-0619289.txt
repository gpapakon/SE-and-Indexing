<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for the synthesis of alkyl ketene 
dimers by the dehydrohalogenation of a C₆ - C₂₂ saturated or 

unsaturated linear fatty acid halide, comprising reacting the 
fatty acid chloride with a cyclic tertiary amine in an inert 

solvent at a temperature of up to 75°, separating tertiary amine 
hydrochloride salts from alkyl ketene dimer dissolved in the 

solvent, and recovering the alkyl ketene dimer from the solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the synthesis of
alkyl ketene dimers by the dehydrohalogenation of C8 - C22
saturated or unsaturated linear fatty acid chlorides with
tertiary amines in an inert solvent.It is well known to react reaction of saturated linear fatty
acid chlorides with linear tertiary amines in a variety of inert
solvents to make disubstituted ethanones, such as alkyl ketene
dimers, which are useful as constituents of paper sizes as well
as for other applications in industry. For instance, U.S.
Patents 2,238,826 and 2,369,919, and an article by J. C. Sauer,
Ketene Dimers from Acid Halides, in the Journal of the American
Chemical Society, 69 2444-8 (1947) describe such reactions.
Among the known useful solvents are benzene, toluene, xylene,
ligroin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, diethyl ether, dibutyl
ether, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and trichloroethylene.
The known families of solvents can be classified as:
1. alkanes and alkane petroleum fractions;2. cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane;3. aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and
xylene;4. chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene,
dichlorobenzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and
trichloroethylene; and5. ethers such as diethyl ether.The reaction in the said solvents to produce alkyl ketene
dimer (AKD) in solution also produces linear tertiary amine
hydrochloride (LTEA-HCl) as a finely divided precipitate. For 
some of the known solvent families, problems encountered in the
alkyl ketene dimerization reaction are low AKD selectivity
(<80%), an excessively viscous dimerization mixture, or very
small amine-hydrochloride crystals in the dimerization slurry
that are hard to separate by mechanical procedures such as
filtration and/or centrifugation and decantation.U.S. Patents 2,238,826 and 2,369,919 indicate that
saturated acyclic amines free of active hydrogen are preferred
for the said reaction, although they indicate that suitable
amines include 1-methylpiperidine, 1-isopropylpiperidine, and 1-methylpyrrolidene.
From the disclosure, of the '919 Patent it is
apparent that the use of the preferred linear amines requires a
very dilute reaction mixture (100-200 parts solvent per tenth
mol of each reactant to obtain a yield of 60 to 97%. That degree
of dilution appears to be necessary to prevent the dimerization
reaction slurry from becoming highly viscous, which would make
separation of a linear tertiary amine hydrochloride (LTEA-HCl)
precipitate from the reaction mixture extremely difficult
