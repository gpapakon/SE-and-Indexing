<ABSTRACT>
Fan-shaped depth sounders, which receive the emitted ultrasound pulses again in a large number of narrowly focussed receiving sectors, are used for charting and exploration of waterways. Since the predominant number of receiving directions are aligned such that they are inclined downwards, these ultrasound pulses propagate on a curved path, as a result of sound bending. The sound bending is caused by layers where the speed of sound differs, accurate knowledge of these layers being necessary in order to determine an average speed of sound. In the case of the proposed method, no separate measurement probe is required to determine the average speed of sound, but the average speed of sound is determined by a regression method based on the propagation time measurements of the ultrasound pulses. For this purpose, the bottom profile on which the measured propagation times are based is initially determined using an assumed average speed of sound and is compared with a bottom profile model which is composed of function elements modelled in a specific manner. Since a correction factor for the average speed of sound can be determined from the function elements, improved values for the depth of the bottom profile can be determined iteratively using the measured propagation times and the corrected speed of sound. Such a method can be used advantageously on research and survey ships in order to achieve the high accuracies required for survey technology.

Method of determining depth values of a stretch of water with a fan
sounder which on the basis of each emitted transmission pulse for a plurality of

predetermined reception directions receives sounding pulses scattered or
reflected by the bottom of the stretch of water, measures the travel time of these

sounding pulses and from the travel time, reception time and mean speed of
sound determines the respective depth value, characterised in that the depth

values T(i) associated with the respective reception directions i or deviations A(i)
are delivered to a regression computer (90) as input data, that the known method

of multiple linear regression is used to calculate coefficients K

equalising function which represents a model function of the profile of the

bottom of the stretch of water and which approximates the depth values T(i) with
minimum error, that at least one of the calculated coefficients K

 is an evaluation
factor for a part-function x

dependent upon the mean speed of sound, and that a corrected mean speed of

sound is determined for the evaluated part-function x

determination of the depth values.
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that for at least one further
iteration the corrected depth values are delivered to the regression computer (90)

as input data.

way that it has a constant depth for all reception directions or deviations A(i),

that a second part-function x

(i) is determined in such a way that the bottom
profile modelled thereby has a constant gradient, and that a third part-function

x

A(i) it corresponds to differential depths of the modelled bottom profile relative

to the determined depth values T(i) on the basis of a constant alteration of the
mean sound of speed c

Method as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
constant depth of the first part-function is 1 m, the constant gradient of the

modelled bottom profile of the second part-function is 1Â° and the alteration in the
speed of sound of the third part-function is 1 m/s.
Method as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
variance and/or the correlation factor of the corrected depth values are

determined and that the iterative calculation of the corrected depth values with
the corrected speed of sound is ended when the variance and/or the correlation

factor are smaller than a predeterminable threshold value.
