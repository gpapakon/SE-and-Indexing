<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an abrasive sheet member 
(110, 210, 310) produced from the interstitial sheet 

material (106, 206, 306) between circular abrasive discs 
during converting operations. The sheet material 

includes at least three projecting ends (112) separated 
from each other by a boundary (116, 216, 316) having a 

radius of curvature with a center of curvature located 
outside the sheet member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an abrading wheel 
including a plurality of individual sheet members that 
each have at least three projecting ends. Abrading wheels comprising one or more circular 
abrasive discs are often used to rotatively remove 
material from a surface. These circular discs are 
typically die cut from a larger sheet of abrasive 
material, which may comprise, for example, a backing and 
a plurality of abrasive grains bonded to the backing. 
An exemplary circular abrasive disc is available from 
the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. 
Paul, Minnesota under the designation Three-M-iteâ„¢ Resin 
Bond Disc. In the die cutting process used to produce circular 
abrasive discs, a plurality of circular dies are 
arranged to cut a like plurality of discs from the 
abrasive sheet member. The arrangement of the dies, and 
thus of the discs cut in the sheet, may be selected as 
desired. Two such arrangements are shown in Figures 1 
and 2. The circular abrasive discs are cut from a 
larger sheet 12 by a die cutting apparatus, leaving a 
sheet member having a plurality of arranged openings. 
This operation is known as "converting," and it is 
desirable in the converting industry to minimize waste 
when converting large abrasive sheet members into 
smaller circular abrasive discs. However, some amount 
of waste is almost unavoidable when cutting circular 
discs from a rectangular sheet member. This waste, 
referred to herein as the interstitial sheet material 
14, remains between adjacent circular discs after  
 
converting, and has heretofore been discarded. This 
interstitial sheet material can amount to a sizable 
percentage of the total area of the sheet material, and 
thus such converting operations can be wasteful and 
inefficient. It is therefore desirable to minimize the waste 
that has previously been the product of abrasive disc 
converting operations. The present invention includes an abrasive sheet 
member having at least three projecting ends, wherein 
each end is separated from each adjacent end by a 
boundary having a radius of curvature with a center of 
curvature located outside the sheet member. These 
abrasive sheet members may easily be cut from the larger 
abrasive sheet during converting operations, and thus 
reduce waste in converting. The sheet member may 
include, for example, three or more ends, a central 
aperture, and the respective radii of curvature may be 
equal to or different from each other. In another embodiment, an abrading wheel is 
provided, comprising a

<CLAIMS>
An abrading member comprising an abrasive 
sheet member (110, 210, 310) having at least three 

projecting ends (112), each end separated from each 
adjacent end by a boundary (116, 216, 316) having a 

radius of curvature with a center of curvature located 
outside the sheet member. 
The abrading member of claim 1, wherein said 
sheet member (110, 210, 310) includes a central aperture 

(114, 214, 314) formed therein. 
The abrading member of claim 2, further 
comprising: 


(a) a plurality of said sheet members (110, 
210, 310); 
(b) means (120, 122) for fastening said sheet 
members together through said respective central 

apertures thereby forming an abrading wheel (118); 
and 
(c) means (122) for enabling engagement of 
the abrading wheel (118) with a source of rotary 

power. 
The abrading member of claim 1 or 3, wherein 
the radius of curvature for each of the boundaries (116, 

216, 316) of the sheet member (110, 210, 310) is equal. 
The abrading member of claim 1 or 3, wherein 
each radius of curvature is constant for each respective 

boundary (116, 216, 316). 
The abrading member of claim 1 or 3, wherein 
the sheet member (110, 210, 310) is a coated abrasive 

sheet member. 
The abrading member of claim 1 or 3, wherein 
the sheet member (110, 210, 310) is a non-woven abrasive 

sheet member. 
The abrading wheel (118) of claim 3, wherein 
said fastening means and said engagement means comprise 

a bolt (120) for insertion through the respective 
central apertures (114, 214, 314) of the sheet members 

(110, 210, 310), and a mandrel (122) adapted to receive 
the bolt. 
A method of forming the abrasive sheet member 
(110, 210, 310) of claim 1, comprising the steps of: 


(a) providing an abrasive sheet material 
(100); 
(b) cutting the sheet member (110, 210, 310) 
from the sheet material (100) with a cutting die 

apparatus. 
The method of claim 9, wherein the die is also 
adapted to cut a circular abrasive disc from the sheet 

material (100), and wherein the method further includes 
the step of: 


(c) cutting a circular abrasive disc from the 
sheet material (100) concurrently with step (b). 
The method of claim 10, wherein at least a 
portion of said boundary (116, 216, 316) is formed by 

cutting said circular abrasive disc from the sheet 
material (100).
