<ABSTRACT>
Fax machine (1) configured to be linked to a data transmission line (2) which it shares with a terminal (3), comprising a transformer (4) configured in order, at the primary (5), to be linked to the line (2), at the secondary (8) to a data processing interface (9), and a circuit (7) for looping the line (2) configured to allow a loop current to pass when the line (2) is linked to the interface (9), the fax machine being characterised in that it includes control means (10) configured to be linked at high impedance to the secondary (8) of the transformer (4) and, depending on the nature of the data transmitted on the line (2), either to link the interface (9) to the transformer (4), or to isolate it therefrom and to inhibit the current from passing in the line looping circuit (7). Application to fax machines.

<CLAIMS>
Facsimile machine (1) arranged to be connected to a data
transmission line (2) which it shares with a terminal (3),

comprising a transformer (4), arranged in order, at the primary
coil (5), to be connected to the line (2), at the secondary coil

(8), to a processing data interface (9), and a circuit (7),
for looping the line (2) in order to connect the line to the

primary coil of the transformer,arranged to allow a loop current
to pass when the line (2) is connected to the interface (9), the

facsimile machine being characterized by the fact that it
comprises control means (10, 16) arranged to be connected at high

impedance to the secondary coil (8) of the transformer (4) and
thus in order, depending on the nature of the data transmitted

on the line (2), either to connect the interface (9) to the
transformer (4), or to isolate it therefrom and inhibit the

passage of current in the line looping circuit (7).
Facsimile machine according to Claim 1, in which the line
looping circuit (7) is connected to the line (2) through a switch

(13) controlled by a call detector circuit (60).
Facsimile machine according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in
which connection means (11), controlled by said control means

(10, 16), are provided for connecting the interface (9) to the
secondary coil (8) of the transformer (4).
Facsimile machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which the looping circuit (7) is implanted in parallel with

respect to the primary coil (5) of the transformer (4).
Facsimile machine according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in
which the looping circuit (7) comprises a direct current

generator whereof the current can be switched by said control
means (10, 16).
