<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a network management system for configurating and reading data and states of several network elements, such as telephone exchanges, of a telecommunication network by giving the network elements commands according to their internal command language when at least some of the network elements of the telecommunication network have mutually different internal command languages. The network management system of the invention comprises memory means (25) for storing parameters describing the command language of each network element, means for generating service requests (Rq) in a network element independent format, conversion means (21, 22, 23) for converting said network element independent service requests into commands according to the command language of the network element which is the target of service by means of parameters describing the command language of said network element, and means for sending the generated commands to the network element which is the target of service. The network management updates the parameter files automatically by giving the network elements a specific command which reads the internal data structures, such as syntactic, semantic and user help data, of any other internal command or command response of the network element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a network management
system for configuring and reading data and states of
several network elements, such as telephone exchanges,
of a telecommunication network by giving the network
elements commands according to their internal command
language when at least some of the network elements of
the telecommunication network have mutually different
internal command languages, the system comprising memory
means for storing parameters describing the command
language of each network element, means for generating
service requests in a network element independent
format, conversion means for converting said network
element independent service requests into commands
according to the command language of the network element
which is the target of service by means of parameters
describing the command language of said network element,
means for sending the generated commands to the network
element which is the target of service, means for
receiving command responses sent by the network element
which is the target of service and for converting them
into a network element independent format.Modern telecommunication networks comprise a
large number of different kinds of network elements,
such as telephone exchanges, transmission systems, etc.,
the states and data of which the network operator must
read and change daily. Typical examples of recurrent
changes are deletion, addition or modification of subscribers,
and different changes in routing for instance
when a network element is overloaded. The exchanges are
controlled either by remote control or locally by inputting
commands for configurating their data, changing
their states, etc. A modern telephone exchange may have
several hundreds of different commands by which exchange 
specific data can be modified. On the other hand, many
kinds of data are received from the exchanges: alarm
outputs, measurement reports, charging data.There have been attempts to develop network
management systems which in a centralized manner would
carry out the configuration and reading of data and
states of different network elements in a telecommunication
network. At present, the standardization organizations
(e.g. ETSI, CCITT) are specifying the management
standards for telephone exchanges and all network
elements in general. Such a concept is called a TMN
(Telecommunication Management Network). Standardized
interfaces between the control system and the network
elements are of crucial importance in standardization.
However, such new standardized solutions will not

<CLAIMS>
A network management system for configuring
and reading data and states of several network

elements (5, 6, 7, 8), such as telephone exchanges, of
a telecommunication network by giving the network

elements commands according to their internal command
language when at least some of the network elements of

the telecommunication network have mutually different
internal command languages, the system comprising


memory means (25, 26) for storing parameters
describing the command language of each network element

(5, 6, 7),
means (WS) for generating service requests (Rq)
in a network element independent format,
conversion means (21, 22, 23) for converting
said network element independent service requests into

commands according to the command language of the network
element which is the target of service 
by means of
parameters describing the command language of said network

element,
means (1) for sending the generated commands to
the network element which is the target of service,
means (24) for receiving command responses sent
by the network element which is the target of service

and for converting them into a network element independent
format, 
characterized
 in that
the internal commands of at least one network element

(5, 6, 7) include a reading command for reading the
internal data structures, such as syntactic, semantic

and user help data, of any other internal command or
command response of the network element, and that

the network management
system is adapted by means of said reading command automatically to update the parameters which 

describe the command language of the network element and
which are stored in said memory means (25, 26).
A network management system according to
claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said
conversion means comprises


command request means (22) for converting a
network element independent service request (Rq) into

a plurality of network element dependent command
requests, and
command generation means (23) for generating
network element dependent commands as a response to the

command requests received from the command request means
(22) by means of said parameters describing the command

language of the network element.
A network management system according to
claim 2, 
characterized
 in that said
conversion means comprises


means (22) for verifying the network element
independent service request, and
means (22) for starting the establishment of a
link to the network element which is the target of

service.
A network management system according to
claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in that the
internal data structures, such as the syntactic and

semantic structures, of the internal command languages
of network elements are substantially in compliance with

the CCITT recommendations Z.301-Z.341.

one of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that said means (WS) for generating service requests
comprise user application programmes.
A network management system according to
claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the user
application programmes comprise subscriber and line

deletion, closing, opening, or modification of subscriber

connections.
