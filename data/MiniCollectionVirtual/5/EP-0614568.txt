<ABSTRACT>
Programmable non-volatile analog voltage source devices (20) and methods wherein analog voltages may be sampled and stored in a non-volatile manner for output, typically through parallel output buffers (26). In one form and in a single integrated circuit, an input (VIN) provided to the circuit may be stored at any analog storage location as determined by an address (CS0-CS2) also provided to the circuit, the storage location determining at which of the outputs of the circuit the stored value will appear. While the storage (22), achieved by way of storage of differential voltages in floating gate MOSFET devices, is non-volatile, the same is also electrically alterable as desired. Various alternate embodiments and methods including the ability to address multiple pages of analog storage locations for storage of analog signals and selective parallel output of each page of the storage, output enable capabilities, parallel inputs and digital inputs are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of analog 
voltage storage and output devices, and circuits and methods of 
sensing, storing and outputting analog voltages. In the domain of analog electronics there is often a need 
for programmable DC analog voltages for system trimming, system 
control and system parameter setting applications. These 
voltages typically are set through the use of mechanical trim 
potentiometers (trim pots) or through digital to analog 
convertors (DACs) where digital bits are used to set the proper 
analog voltage storage through some form of digital to analog 
convertor, or through sample and hold networks for short term 
analog storage. Most such systems require more than one 
programmable voltage source, and in fact, some may need more 
then 100 such as an automatic tester. Some systems go through 
one time factory programming of these programmable voltage 
sources, other systems frequently set these voltage sources 
under user control, and yet other systems routinely perform auto 
calibration functions under the control of a microprocessor. 
The programming of the voltage sources are normally performed 
for various reasons, e.g.: compensating the long term system 
parameter drift, trimming the manufacturing tolerances of 
various components of a system in order to achieve optimum  
 
system performance or controlling the functionality of the 
multi-purpose programmable systems. Mechanical trim potentiometers are bulky and expensive, are 
sensitive to mechanical vibration and are effected by the high 
solder temperature they are exposed to during surface mount pc 
board bonding. Layout of a pc board and packaging also becomes 
cumbersome, since physical access routes for the mechanical 
adjustment probes have to be allowed for. Sample and hold 
networks avoid most of these problems, but have the problem of 
charge leakage, whereby frequent refreshing is required. 
Digital storage of analog voltages together with multiple 
digital to analog convertors when integrated in monolithic form 
use a lot of silicon real estate, hence, are expensive. Both 
the sample and hold networks and the digital to analog 
convertors are volatile voltage sources, in that sample and hold 
networks have to be refreshed frequently, and the input bits for 
digital to analog convertors have to be held fixed, 
respectively. For the multi DAC systems, non-volatility is 
achieved through the use of some kind of non-volatile storage 
media (EEPROM, EPRCMs, disk, etc.) to hold the input digital bit
