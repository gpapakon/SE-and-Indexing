<ABSTRACT>
A hologram structure for use in a holographic center 
high mounted stoplight system for a vehicle. The hologram 

structure includes an illumination source (30) for providing 
a reconstruction beam, a first array (31) of non-overlapping 

hologram cells and non-hologram cells, and a 
second array (32) of non-overlapping hologram and non-hologram 

cells. Each hologram cell of the first array 
produces a specular image that is viewable in a first 

predetermined angular field pursuant to diffraction of a 
portion of the reconstruction beam, and each hologram cell 

of the second array produces a diffuse image that is 
viewable in a second predetermined angular field pursuant 

to diffraction of a portion of the reconstruction beam. 
The specular images and diffuse images produced by the 

first and second holograms form stoplight illumination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The disclosed invention is directed generally to
holograms for center high mounted stoplights for vehicles,
and more particularly to a hologram that efficiently meets
the required brightness and angular coverage and to an
exposure technique for recording such hologram.Present US and also German federal regulations require center high
mounted stoplights (CHMSLs) in addition to the standard
stoplights mounted in the rear portion of an automobile.
The high mounted stoplights are intended to maximize the
visibility of the automobile braking indicators to drivers
following the braking vehicle, and are commonly mounted on
the rear window of an automobile.High mounted stoplights have commonly been implemented
as a standard lenticular lens, a red filter, an illuminating
incandescent bulb, and a reflector enclosed in a
housing that is typically secured adjacent the top or
bottom of an automobile rear window. However, the bulky
housing partially obscures the rearward vision of the
driver, and moreover imposes limitations on the design of
the automobile.Center high mounted stoplights have been also integrated
into automobile body parts such as rear decks,
spoilers, roofs, which to some degree substantially reduce
or remove the rearward vision problem. However, such 
stoplights are complex and may impose limitations on the
design of the automobile.Holographic center high mounted stoplights have also
been developed in order to efficiently meet the stoplight
regulations. A consideration with the use of holograms for
holographic center high mounted stoplights is the desire to
achieve an output having a lenticulated appearance that is
similar to that provided by conventional stoplights.Another consideration with the use of holograms for
holographic center high mounted stoplights is the complexity
in meeting governmental luminous intensity and angular
coverage requirements while utilizing a reconstruction
light source of minimum power. The luminous intensity and
angular coverage requirements generally include a quantitative
aspect that defines luminous intensity over a defined
central angular region, and a qualitative aspect that
requires visibility over a horizontal angular region that
is greater than the horizontal component of the defined
central angular region. Essentially, the regulations
require a brighter region generally in the center of the
entire angular field of coverage. From US-A-5 106 174 a hologram for a center high mounted
stoplight for vehicles is known that diffracts playback illumination
over a wide
