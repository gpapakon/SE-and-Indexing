<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is used for testing electric modules (M). In this connection, at least one container (B) is provided which has openings (OP) into which one module (M) can be inserted in each case in such a manner that the opening (OP) is closed tightly at least to an approximate degree and that the container (B) has at least one access (ZG) which can be connected to the output (AG) of a unit (T/F-A) which is suitable for emitting a medium (M) of selectable temperature and/or moisture content. The device provides for the functional testing of the modules (M) whilst, for example, cycling through temperatures or running other tests.

Apparatus for testing modules (M) having at
least one container (B) which has openings (OP) into

which modules (M) can be inserted in such a way that
the openings (OP) are sealed at least approximately

tightly, and having a unit (T/F-A) which is suitable
for changing the climate within the container (B),

characterized in that a conveyor apparatus (KLL;FB) is
provided, by means of which the container (B) can be

transported from a receiving site at least to the unit
(T/F-A) and further to a delivery site, and in that the

container (B) has at least one access (ZG) which can be
connected to an output (AG) of the unit (T/F-A) which

is suitable for the delivery of a medium (x) of
selectable temperature by way of the output (AG).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that the access (ZG) for the medium (x) is provided

on the lower side of the container (B) and can be
connected to the output (AG) of the unit (T/F-A) by way

of bellows (BWS).
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the conveyor apparatus (KLL; FB)

is a carousel or a conveyor belt.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the modules (M) are

provided with preferably optical transmission devices
(D) or contacts (STV) which, after the insertion of the

modules (M) into the container (B), are accessible from
the outside by way of a function testing device.
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized
in that the function testing device which can be

coupled to the module (M) is connected to the unit
(T/F-A) and in that the moisture supply, cooling or

heating procedure is controllable in dependence upon
the values measured by the function testing device.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a vibration apparatus is

provided, to which the containers (B) can be supplied.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the containers (B) have

contacts by way of which at least the supply voltage
can be supplied to the modules (M) contained in the

container (B).
