<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the manipulation of 
paper roll heads by means of a multi-axis robot (8). 

When the heads are fetched by means of the robot (8) 
from multiple piles (1 - 7), valid information on the 

position or height of the piles (1 - 7) is not known by 
the robot (8) after the piles are replenished. According 

to the invention, when the operation of the robot (8) is 
halted for the duration of, e.g., the replenishment of the 

head piles (1 - 7), the parameter data for all piles are 
set unknown. As the system operation is restarted, the 

robot (8) performs a slow-speed approach toward an 
uncalibrated pile, measures the pile data, that is, 

calibrates the pile height and position, and thus can 
perform the next pile approach through a normal fetch 

cycle on the basis of the measured data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1 
for fetching heads from a plurality of piles by means of a automatic multi-axis 
robot. In the wrapping of paper rolls the inner heads are first placed onto the ends of 
each roll, after which a sufficient length of the wrapper is wrapped about the roll 
and then the overlaps of the wrapper are crimped against the rims of the inner 
heads. Conventionally using a hot-melt glue, the outer head is next adhered to the 
end of the roll covering the crimped edge of the wrapper and the inner head. The 
inner head is usually relatively thick and thus capable of protecting the roll end 
against mechanical damage. The outer head can thus be thinner serving for the 
purpose of binding the wrapper at the roll ends and protecting the roll against 
humidity. Frequently, the coloring and printed pattern of the outer head are 
designed to give the roll a neat appearance. The heads can be placed on the roll ends in a number of different ways. Manual 
placing of the heads is the oldest method, and it is still suited for relatively small-capacity 
wrapping lines or applications not requiring an improved degree of 
automation. Here, the operator simply places the inner heads manually to the roll 
ends and the corresponding outer heads onto heated press platens, which next 
press the outer heads to adhere to the roll ends. The inner heads are held against 
the roll ends by means of separate retaining arms for the duration of the crimping 
of the wrapper overlaps against the roll ends. The adherence of the outer heads 
on the platens is in turn implemented with the help of a vacuum. Various kinds of automatic heading machines have long been in use and several 
different types of such equipment are known. A common feature for almost all 
automatic heading equipment is that, for each end of the roll, a separate heading 
machine with a head clamp is provided that serves for moving the head from the 
head pile to the roll end. In a prior-art heading machine, a rotatable arm is  
 
mounted on a vertical guide, said arm having at its end a rotatable vacuum clamp 
for grasping the heads. Such a heading machine is conventionally used in conjunction 
with different kinds of head storage shelves situated beside the heading 
machine. Using this machine, the heads are placed on the roll end so that the support 
arm of the clamp is transferred along the vertical guide to the level of the 
shelf containing the correct size of heads. Next, the support arm of

<CLAIMS>
A method for fetching heads from piles by means of a multi-axis robot (8), in 
which method: 


the heads are placed in at least two piles (1 - 7) within the operating 
area of the robot (8), and 
the heads are fetched from the piles (1 - 7) by picking with the help 
of a clamp (10) mounted to the end of the arm (9) of the robot, 
characterized
 in that 

in a halt situation of the operation of the robot (8), at least one of 
the pile data parameters is reset unknown for each pile, and 
said unknown pile parameter is resolved for each pile (1 - 7) in 
conjunction with the first fetch cycle of a head from the pile after said 

halt situation. 
A method as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said pile data 
parameter to be reset unknown is the height of the pile (15). 
A method as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said pile data 
parameter to be reset unknown is the position of the pile (15) in a predetermined 

direction. 
A method as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said pile data 
parameter to be reset unknown is both the height and position of the pile. 
A method as defined in claim 1, 3 or 4, 
characterized
 in that the 
height of the pile (15) is determined after the halt situation so that  

 

the presumed height of the pile (15) is set equal to the maximum 
height of the pile, 
the clamp (10) is controlled over the pile, to a preset distance above 
the preset maximum pile height, 
the clamp (10) is lowered toward the pile (15) until 


the upper surface of the pile (15) is detected, or 
the clamp (10) has been lowered by a preset distance, 
whereby 
if the proximity of the upper surface of the pile (15) has been 
detected, a slow-speed inching mode is assumed in which the lowering 

movement is continued to the instant in which either clamp contact 
with the pile upper surface is sensed, whereby the sensed pile height is 

set as the current pile height, or alternatively, the clamp has been 
lowered by a preset distance, and 
if the proximity of the upper surface of the pile (15), or a contact 
with the upper surface of the pile (15), has not been detected within 

the preset lowering distance, the movement of the clamp (10) is 
continued in preset lowering distances until either the upper surface of 

the pile (15) or a preset minimum height of the pile (15) is reached. 
A method as defined in any foregoing claim 1, 3 - 5, 
characterized
 
in that the position of the pile (15) is determined so that  

 

the clamp (10) is controlled above the pile (15) to a position 
corresponding to the initial picking position of heads from a correctly 

placed pile (15), which position is then used as the starting point of 
the position measurement, 
the clamp is next transferred toward the head pile edge radially with 
regard to the pile (15) until the edge of the pile (15) is detected, 
the difference (Î”X) between the distance from the initial point to the 
detected pile edge and the distance from the initial point stored in 

memory for each pile size to the edge of correctly positioned pile is 
determined, and the position information corrected by said difference 

is set as the valid position of the pile. 
A method as defined in claim 6, 
characterized
 in that the transfer 
path of the clamp (10) at least essentially traverses the symmetry axis (K) of the 

pile.
