<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous-based mixtures comprising colloidal vanadium oxide and a dispersed sulfonated polymer impart antistatic properties to coatings on a substrate and to self-supporting articles. The preferred colloidal vanadium oxide is alkoxide derived and provides mixed valence vanadium oxide wherein the vanadium ions are typically +4 and +5. Preferred sulfopolymers include sulfopolyesters, sulfopolyurethanes, sulfopolyurethanes/ureas, sulfopolyester polyols, and sulfopolyols. Antistatic composite structures comprising colloidal vanadium oxide and a sulfopolymer are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous-based polymeric 
compositions comprising colloidal vanadium oxide, a 
method therefor, and articles comprising this 
composition. The compositions impart antistatic 
properties to coatings on a substrate and to 
self-supporting articles. A build-up of electrical charges, known as "static 
electricity", can discharge suddenly and cause 
undesirable sparking particularly in rolled up or 
fibrous products such as carpets and brushes. It is 
known in the art that antistatic materials can avoid or 
compensate for the build-up of static electricity. 
Preferred antistats are electronic conductors which 
operate independent of humidity. Vanadium oxide dispersions are known in the art 
and have been reported to be effective antistatic 
layers. Such dispersions can be used in photographic 
constructions. Sulfopolymers are known in the art and have been 
disclosed. Utilities disclosed for these polymers 
include photoresists, sponges, binders, size coats, and 
adhesives. It is known in the art that aqueous copolyester 
dispersions wherein ionic antistatic agents, such as 
monosodium salt of vanadic acid, are added can form 
subbing layers for photographic media. It has generally not been possible to provide 
electron conducting, electrically dissipative coatings 
as thin, transparent, virtually colorless coatings 
formed from aqueous polymeric solutions or dispersions.  
 Briefly, the present invention provides an 
aqueous-based mixture comprising colloidal vanadium 
oxide and a dispersed sulfonated polymer. Antistatic 
coatings derived from aqueous dispersions are 
particularly desirable because they avoid environmental 
and waste disposal problems associated with organic 
solvents. In another aspect, the invention provides the 
above-described mixture on a support. A variety of 
supports can be useful in solid, film, and fibrous 
forms, and include, for example, polymeric, cellulosic, 
woven and nonwoven, metal, siliceous, and ceramic 
supports. In a further aspect, a dry coating comprising a 
mixture of vanadium oxide and sulfonated polymer on a 
support is provided by removal of the aqueous-based 
liquid. In yet a further aspect, a self-supporting article 
is provided which is a mixture, composite, or layered 
structure comprising colloidal vanadium oxide and 
sulfopolymer. In one embodiment, the article comprises 
a layer of vanadium oxide overcoated with sulfopolymer. 
In another embodiment, the article comprises a layer of 
sulfopolymer overcoated with vanadium oxide. Such
