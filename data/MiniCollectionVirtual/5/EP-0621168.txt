<ABSTRACT>
A torsion bar device includes a torsion bar 
(3) having a torsional portion (6), an upper connecting 

portion (5) associated with an input shaft, and a lower 
connecting portion (7) associated with an output shaft; a 

first cylinder (13) for encompassing the torsional 
portion, one end of the first cylinder being connected to 

one of the upper and lower connecting portions, and the 
other end of the first cylinder extending in the 

longitudinal direction of the torsion bar to the other 
connecting portion of the torsion bar; a second cylinder 

(20) for encompassing and being connected to the other one 
of the upper and lower connecting portions of the torsion 

bar; a first supporting member (14, 15) for supporting the 
torsion bar at the other end of the first cylind
er in a 
circumferential direction of the torsion bar; a second 

supporting member (21) for supporting the torsion bar in 
the circumferential direction at a portion of the second 

cylinder where the second supporting member is aligned 
with the first supporting member; and an elastic member 

(22) for elastically restoring the alignment of the first 
and second supporting members by applying a force in a 

direction opposite to a torsionally stressed 
circumferential direction of the torsion bar when a 

steering wheel is turned so as to regain the original 
neutral position of the steering wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a torsion bar device for a
power steering system according to the preamble of claim 1 and
known for example from WO-A-8702318.A power steering of an automotive vehicle
is a power-assisted device which facilitates the turning
of a steering wheel by a vehicle operator. In order to
achieve the function of the power steering, it is
necessary to provide a torsion bar device which stably
regains the original neutral position of the steering
wheel after the steering wheel is turned.A rotary valve type power steering system
including an input shaft, a torsion bar, and an output
shaft is known. The rotation of the steering wheel turned
by a vehicle operator is transferred to a rotary valve
through the input shaft, the torsion bar and the output
shaft. Pressure oil from an oil pump is supplied to a
power cylinder, and the supplied oil in the power cylinder
is supplied back to the oil pump, in accordance with the
rotation of the steering wheel. The turning of the
steering wheel by the vehicle operator is facilitated by
the power cylinder to which the pressure oil is supplied.The known power steering system includes a
valve mechanism which inherently lowers the rigidity of 
the steering gear mechanism when the steering wheel is
around its original neutral position. The known power
steering system has a problem in that the steering gear
mechanism becomes less rigid when the steering wheel is
around the original neutral position. This problem is
more appreciable to the operator during high speed running
or slalom running of the automotive vehicle.Several torsion bar mechanisms for
enhancing the rigidity of the steering gear mechanism of
the power steering system when the steering wheel is
around its original neutral position have been proposed. From the WO-A-87 02318 a generic torsion bar device is known
which comprises a metal bellows. This metal bellows is
deformable in the axial direction of a torsion bar and applies
a biasing force to a centering piece. Due to the special
arrangement of the recesses formed in the centering piece and a
second centering piece mounted on the second cylinder means a
force component is produced in the circumferential direction of
the torsion bar when the steering wheel is turned and the first
centering piece is pushed to compress the metal bellows. By
this way the metal bellows act for restoring the alignment of
the recesses elastically by applying the aforementioned force
component in a direction opposite to the torsionally stressed
circumferential
