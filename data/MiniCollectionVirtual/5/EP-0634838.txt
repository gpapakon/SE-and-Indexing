<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit assembly for controlling a 
push-pull stage comprising at least two metal-oxide 
semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistors including 
connectable charging and discharging circuits by means of 
which the gate-source capacitances can be charged and 
discharged according to a corresponding time constant, the 
value of which is a function of the internal resistance of 
the corresponding charging and discharge circuit respectively 
and of the corresponding gate-source capacitance. Particularly in power output stages it is often a requirement 
that the corresponding power MOS field-effect transistors 
need to be switched ON/OFF softly to ensure maintaining the 
specified maximum permissible values of the rise and fall 
times of the output voltage or output current. For this purpose suitable charging and discharge circuits are 
provided the internal resistance of which together with the 
associated gate-source capacitance determines the ON/OFF time 
constant., whereby the wanted rate of change of the 
corresponding gate voltage is normally defined by an ohmic 
resistance connected in series with the gate-source 
capacitance or by a current which is impressed on the 
charging or discharging circuit. Although controlling MOS field-effect transistors in this way 
results in the wanted limiting of the rise and fall rates of 
the output voltage or of the output current in push-pull 
stages too, whereby the internal resistance of the charging 
and discharging circuits is to be selected all the more 
higher, the lower the rate of change of the output signal is 
required, when the push-pull stages contain two MOS field-effect 
transistors in series, however, there is a problem 
that when changing over from one MOS field-effect transistor 
to the other a current flows through the series circuit  
 
containing the two MOS field-effect transistors which can 
assume relatively high values since in the transitional phase 
this current is usually limited by the drain-source 
resistances only of the MOS field-effect transistors which, 
at least partly, are in forward control. Such an unwanted 
flow of current will materialize due to both MOS field-effect 
transistors of the push-pull stage being simultaneously 
rendered conducting at least partly during the changeover 
phase. The duration of this critical changeover phase is all 
the more longer, the smaller the rate of change of the gate 
voltages is selected to achieve the wanted limited rise and 
fall times of the output voltage. In a
