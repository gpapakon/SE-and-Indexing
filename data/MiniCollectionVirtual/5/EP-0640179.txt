<ABSTRACT>
Described is a driver (17) used as the link-piece between the piston (1) of an injection pump and a drive element which rests freely against the end of the piston nearest the drive and moves with the piston. The driver is attached to the drive element in such a way that, in order to establish the link between the piston and the drive element, it can be rotated over the widened far face of a baseplate (2) located at the end of the piston until it reaches a final position in which it is secured by the fact that it grips the piston (1).

<CLAIMS>
Entrainment member (17) as a connection between the piston 
(1) of an injection pump and a driving member moving loosely 

towards the end of the piston on the driving side, corresponding 
to the piston stroke, the end of the piston being formed by an 

enlarged base plate (2) and the entrainment member (17) being 
pivotally attached to the driving member, characterised in that 

for producing the connection, the entrainment member (17) 
attached to the driving member may be pivoted across the rear 

side of the base plate (2) until it reaches an end position, in 
which it is secured by engaging around the piston (1). 
Entrainment member according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises a transverse part (19) engaging behind the base 

plate (2) of the piston (1), which transverse part is provided 
with slots or openings for the entry of the end of the piston 

between the transverse part (19) and driving member. 
Entrainment member according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that for securing the connection, resilient projections (26) are 

provided on the transverse part (19), which spring-in in the end 
position of the pivoting movement, engaging laterally behind the 

piston (1). 
Entrainment member according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that at least its transverse part (19) is constructed as a 

stamped sheet metal part. 
Entrainment member according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the transverse part (19) consists of two sheet metal flaps 

(20, 21) bent into a parallel position at a short distance apart, 
whereof the first (20) engages directly above the rear side of 

the base plate (2) and whereof the second (21) supports the 
resilient projections (26). 
Entrainment member according to Claim 5, characterised in  
 

that the first sheet metal flap (20) has a keyhole-shaped slot 
(22), whereof the enlarged part (23) facilitates the threading-in 

of the base plate (2) and whereof the narrow part (24) has 
dimensions corresponding to the piston diameter. 
Entrainment member according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the second sheet metal flap (21) has a slot (25) open in 

opposition to the pivoting direction, which, with respect to the 
end position of the pivoting movement, after a narrow portion 

formed by the resilient projections (26), is enlarged to form a 
round hole (27) corresponding approximately to the piston 

diameter. 
Entrainment member according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that integrally formed on opposite sides of the transverse part 

(19) are bearing plates (18), which are bent over in planes at 
right angles to the pivot axis (30) and comprise corresponding 

swivel bearing bores. 
Entrainment member according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that at least on their associated sides, the transverse part (19) 

and base plate (2) are constructed to be spherical corresponding 
to the pivoting trajectory of the entrainment member (17).
