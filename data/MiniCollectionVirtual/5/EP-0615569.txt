<ABSTRACT>
An insulated ventilation duct component having at least two connection openings for coupling to other components in a ventilation installation is disclosed. The duct component, comprising an external metal sheet casing (1), an internal insulating material layer and an internal metal sheet coating, forms a unitary, stable and fire isolating unit. The external and internal metal sheet casings are mutually connected by means of one ore more perforated metal sheet elements (2a etc., 2'a etc.), which cover the corresponding end surface of the insulating material layer (6a etc.) and which has a reduced capacity of conducting heat between the inside and the outside of the duct component by way of the perforations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Insulated ventilation duct component and method of producing the sameThe invention concerns an insulated duct component with at least two connecting openings for coupling to other components in a ventilation installation, said duct component comprising an external metal sheet casing enclosing the component all around, a layer of insulating material disposed inside the metal sheet casing, and an internal metal sheet coating. The invention also concerns a method of producing such a duct component.Ventilation ducts are often insulated in order to prevent the transfer of heat to the surrounding, so that e.g. heated supply air in a supply air duct will not cool down, or cooling air will not be heated. It is also desireable to maintain the heat contents in exhaust air in case of an exhaust duct being connected to a heat exchanger, where the heat carried by the exhaust air is normally transferred to the outdoor air, which is blown in through a supply air duct. Heat insulation of ventilation ducts is also essential from the point of view of fire hazard, and hot flue gases or flames should be conducted through a duct without causing a fire in the surrounding con¬ struction members in a building.The most common way of insulating ventilation ducts is to install a metal sheet duct system consisting of straight duct sections, bends, branches, dimensional shifts, sound dampers and other components, whereupon an insulating material is brought on externally, either in the form of mats or layers being laid onto the ducts and fastened in a suitable manner, e.g. by means of a threaded net, or in the form of preformed insulating bodies, e.g. tubular sections.Such mounting of insulating material is normally made largely at the site of the installation, which requires much work and 

 time and is consequently rather costly, in particular at joints and couplings of various kinds.It also well known to provide the inside of metal sheet ducts (in particular rectangular ducts) with insulating layers and to cover the insulating layers internally with loose metal sheets. This can be made in advance in a manufacturing plant, but the making of holes and the like for the connection of branch ducts or the like is made very difficult because the insulating layers and the associated loose metal sheets will easily be cut off and fall into separate pieces. Thus, prob¬ lems often arise at the installation site.The object of the present invention is to eliminate the above mentioned problems and to provide an insulated duct component, which
