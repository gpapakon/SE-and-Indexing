<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski binding having two ski-binding parts, namely a front jaw and a heel-retaining means, of which at least one is mounted in the longitudinal direction of the ski such that it can be moved longitudinally to a limited extent. The ski-binding parts are connected to one another by a length-stable band running at a distance from the upper side of the ski. A spacer is arranged between the front jaw and the heel-retaining means, on the upper side of the ski. According to the invention, the spacer (30 - 30p) is designed to be higher than the distance between the connecting band (20 - 20p) and the upper side (11) of the ski (19), when the latter is in a condition in which it is ready for travel and is not loaded by external forces.

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a ski binding and a ski (10), comprising 
two ski binding parts, namely, a front clamp assembly 

(14) and a heel retainer (15), whereof at least one part is 
mounted for limited displacement in the longitudinal direction 

of said ski (10), said ski binding parts being interconnected 
by a ribbon (20) of stable length extending at a 

distance from the top face of said ski, and a spacer element 
(30) disposed on the top face (11) of said ski (10) between 

said front clamp assembly (14) and said heel retainer (15), 
characterized in that the height of said spacer element (30-30p) 

selected so as to ensure that said interconnecting 
ribbon (20-20g) is in permanent contact with said spacer 

element (30-30g), and that in the standby situation of the 
ski (10), without the action thereon of any external forces, 

said interconnecting ribbon (20-20g) is biased to take support 
on said spacer element (30-30g), whereby said interconnecting 

ribbon (20-20g) acts to exert a pressure on the top 
face (11) of the ski (10). 
The combination according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said spacer element (30d) takes resilient support on 

the bottom side of said interconnecting ribbon (20d) and/or 
on the top face (11) of the ski (10). 
The combination according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said spacer element (30e-30n) is adjustable as regards 

its height and/or its longitudinal position. 
The combination according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said spacer element comprises a body (43e,43f,43m,43n) 

of any suitable shape, for instance in the form of a square 
block, with a passage (34e,34f,34m,34n) for said interconnecting 

ribbon (20e,20f,20m,20n) being formed therethrough 
in the longitudinal direction of the ski.  

 
The combination according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said body (43m) is formed with a vertical bore (44m) 

for receiving a screw (45m) therein, that said screw (45m) 
cooperates with a nut (46m) disposed thereon, and that 

in the mounted state of the ski binding said nut (46m( 
takes support on the top face (11) of the ski (10). 
The combination according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said body (43f,43n) supports in its lower portion a 

horizontal shaft (35f,35n) extending transversely of the 
longitudinal direction of the ski, that said shaft (35f,35n) 

has a roller (36f) or a cam (36n) mounted thereon, and that 
in the mounted state of the ski binding (13f,13m) said 

roller (36f) or said cam (36n), respectively, takes support 
on the top face (11) of the ski (10). 
The combination according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said spacer element (30h-30k) is composed of at least 

two wedges (38h-38k; 39h-39k) disposed at least partially 
between the top face (11) of the ski (10) and said interconnecting 

ribbon (20h-20k), and that the chamfer of said 
wedges (38h-38k; 39h-39k) is directed either in the longitudinal 

direction of the ski or transversely thereof. 
The combination according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the lower wedge (39k) is formed with a recess (41k) of 

approximately V-shaped configuration as viewed in longitudinal 
section, and that this recess (41k) is engaged by a 

horizontally directed projection (42k) of the upper wedge 
(38k). 
The combination according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the lower wedge (39j) is provided with a nose-shaped 

projection (35j) on its side facing towards the top face 
(11) of the ski (10), and that in the mounted state ot 

the ski binding said lower wedge (39j) takes support on the 
top face (11) of the ski (10) with its nose-shaped projectoon 

(35j).  
 
The combination according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said spacer element (30o) is configured as a disc-shaped, 

partially open hollow body, that said spacer element 
(30o) is secured to said interconnecting ribbon (20o) by 

means of a screw (45o) and a nut (46o), and that the securing 
assembly formed by said screw (45o) and said nut (46o) 

is mounted in said interconnecting ribbon (20o) with a 
slight play in the longitudinal direction. 
The combination according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said spacer element (30p) is adapted to be shifted from 

its active position to a neutral position in which it does 
not exert any pressure on the top face (11) of the ski (10). 
The combination according to claim 11, characterized in 
that said spacer element (30p) is mounted on an approximately 

disc-shaped mounting element (50p), that said mounting 
element (50p) is rotatable about an upright axis (90p), that 

said mounting element (50p) and said spacer element (30p) 
are each formed with mutually cooperating control curves 

(49p) or cam faces (52p), respectively, and that said mounting 
element (50p) is provided with an actuating lever (53p) 

by means of which said mounting element (50p) is adapted to

element (30p) is raised, and thus active, to a second position, 
in which said space
r element (30p) is lowered, and
