<ABSTRACT>
Improvements in the manufacturing and installation of 
induction hobs, of the type of which the cooking plate 

is mounted on an opening made to that purpose on the 
top of the furniture, for its location, being that 

induction hob composed by the cooking plate (1) and the 
module (6) including all electronic components, as well 

as the operation controls (9), in such a way that the 
above-mentioned module (6) is located under the cooking 

plate (1), being foreseen that in the module (6) a fan 
may be incorporated (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention, as stated in the heading of 
this descriptive memory, consists of some improvements 
in the manufacturing and installation of induction 
hobs, of the type of those formed by three modules, 
which are the cooking plate, the control module and the 
power module, in such a way that the cooking plate 
incorporates two cooking areas by radiation and other 
two cooking areas by induction, disposing of the 
control lights of residual heat. The improvements introduced in the manufacturing and 
installation of induction hobs are aimed to obtain an 
induction hob, with two modules, being one of them the 
cooking plate and the second one, located under the 
cooking plate, will have the operation controls and the 
power and control elements, obtaining therefore a more 
compact body, which means a simplification in terms of 
industrialization. The power and control module is basically formed by two 
or more power plates, a control plate, a fan and the 
operation controls, obtaining therefore a compression 
of electronics, by reducing the number of electronic 
components, which means the subsequent economic saving 
and a greater simplicity of installation. Conventionally, the induction hobs incorporate 
induction heating elements or combined with 
vitreousceramic elements by radiation, defined by 
corresponding coils located under the ceramic glass on 
which the recipient for cooking the food is located. The cooking plate will be installed in an opening made 
to that purpose on the top of the furniture on which it 
is mounted, being fixed to the top of the furniture in 
many different ways. The control module is formed by a 
frame with a keyboard to control the switch on and the 
power level of the four heating elements. The 
electronic control of the whole hob is performed by a 
microprocessor located in the control module. The control module will be installed in an opening made 
on the top of the furniture, separated a certain 
distance from the cooking plate in order to avoid 
splashing and, at the same time, to allow its 
connection with the power module.  The power module is formed by a metallic box having the 
electronic components that, controlled by the 
microprocessor, sees about powering the heating 
elements. This module will be connected to the mains 
for the current supply. In the installation of the power module, this is 
located in the lower part of the furniture, behind the 
wall tile, being connected to, apart from the mains as 
indicated above, the cooking plate and the

1.- IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MANUFACTURING AND INSTALLATION 
OF INDUCTION HOBS, of the type of which the cooking 

plate is mounted on an opening made to that purpose on 
the top of the furniture, mainly characterized because 

the induction hob is composed of the cooking plate (1) 
and the module (6), which groups all the electronic 

components, as well as the operation controls (9), 
being located under the cooking plate (1), being 

foreseen that in the module (6) is mounted a fan (10) 
attached to the internal side supplied with a grid (14) 

in order to allow the air intake that passing through 
the power plates (7) will go out through the front 

side, with the special feature that the front 
ornamental device it is defined by a bevel (12) that 

forms a hollow opened in the lower part, creating a 
passage (13) so that the air may be lead to the lower 

part.
