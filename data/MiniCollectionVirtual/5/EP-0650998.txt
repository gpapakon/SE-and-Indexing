<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for the acetylation of 
lignocellulosic materials (LM) by (a) bringing the LM into intimate 

contact with an acetylating agent comprising acetic anhydride at a 
temperature from 70-140°C and (b) bringing the acetylated LM from 

step (a) into contact with a superheated chemical agent comprising 
acetic acid and/or anhydride at a temperature above 140°C so as to 

reduce the acetic acid or acetic anhydride content of the acetylated 
LM to below 10% by weight. LM's treated in this manner have 

excellent dimensional stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of acetylated lignocellulosic materials
wherein the lignocellulosic material is treated with acetic
anhydride.By the expression "lignocellulosic materials" is
meant here and throughout the specification a material in
any shape or form such as e.g. shreds, fibres, splinters
and shives, and which are derivable from a source comprising
wood, sisal, jute, coconut and/or other plant material
and which have optionally been subjected to a pretreatment
with a non-acetylating chemical such as e.g.
sodium acetate in order to improve subsequent acetylation
thereof will hereafter be referred to as "LM" for convenience.It is well known in the art to improve the physical
characteristics of LMs and cellulosic materials by treatment
with acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride. A process
for acetylation of lignocellulosic board materials in order
to obtain high dimensional stability is described in
e.g.US-A-2,417,995. A process for acetylation of cellulose
fibres is described e.g. in GB-A-964,197. This process
according to this document comprises three steps: 1)
pre-swelling of substantially dry cellulose fibre with
acetic acid during 10-30 minutes, and removal of excess
acid if necessary, 2) saturation of the swollen fibre
with acetic anhydride at a temperature varying from ambient
temperature to 140°C, and 3) acetylation of the swollen
fibre with dry superheated vapour of acetic anhydride
at 150 - 220°C, preferably during 15-90 minutes.Processes by which LM's are treated in a single step
by immersion of the LM in liquid acetic anhydride followed
by heating and a drying step are known. A process
based on the immersion technique is described in EP-A-0
213 252. One of the problems with systems which use the
immersion technique is that they are usually batch processes 
which need drainage facilities for the liquid in
which the LM is immersed. A single step process of this
type also does not ensure acetylation of the lignocellulosic
material to the desired degree nor the removal of
all of the unreacted chemicals in the treated product.It has now been found that the above problems can be
mitigated by treating the LM with acetic anhydride in two
stages, if necessary, in a continuos process.Accordingly, the present invention is a process for
the 
acetylation of lignocellulosic materials (LM) comprising
a. bringing the LM into intimate contact with an acetylating agent
comprising acetic anhydride as the major component at a temperature
from 70-140°C andb. bringing the
