<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
educational methods at the classroom and individual level,
as well as systems for implementing such methods. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an
educational method which combines audio-visual and
computer technology to shift the teacher's role away from
mass pupil instruction and paperwork and back to the more
traditional role of helping each individual student with
his or her unique educational difficulties.Classroom teaching methods have changed very
little since the early days of our country. The bedrock
of education remains the teacher or professor lecturing to
groups of students, commonly in conjunction with a text.
homework is assigned to reinforce the lessons learned in
class and tests are administered to measure students'
aptitude and retention of the material. At the early
levels of education, the setting for this instruction has
and continues to be the schoolroom, public or private,
where a teacher is responsible for a group of, for
example, fifteen to forty students.The conventional classroom method of teaching a
subject typically involves a lesson plan which includes a
plurality of lectures each having an associated written
homework assignment for the student to reinforce the
lecture. The teacher collects and evaluates the homework
and occasionally gives tests to measure the students'
retention of the material. The teacher is also required
to perform a multitude of other subsidiary tasks, such as
report card generation and parent-teacher conferences, to
keep the community satisfied with both the students' and 
the teacher's performance. Thus under the conventional
classroom scenario, teachers must split their time to
assume the roles of administrator and public relation
officer, as well their supposedly primary role of teacher.Educators have long recognized that while the
classroom scenario provides economies of scale, one
drawback is that students of different ages and aptitudes
learn at differing rates and with the need for varying
amounts of individual attention. This recognition led to
the availability of private tutoring, for those who could
afford such, provides more flexibility to meet an
individual student's needs. On the other hand, private
tutoring has also been criticized since it does not
provide the student with the opportunity to develop social
skills which is inherent in the classroom setting.Although this traditional method of education
has changed little over the years, the amount of
information which students

<CLAIMS>
An educational method which provides an interactive
audio-visual system comprising the steps of :


developing courseware which presents audio-visual
material in a desired manner;
loading said courseware into a plurality of student
workstations (10) and a teacher workstation (40);
selecting one of a plurality of presentation modes
from a student workstation (10);
retrieving and presenting at the student workstation
(10) audio-visual material based on said selection

step;
displaying, at the end of said presenting step, a
plurality of questions based on said audio-visual

material;
comparing answers received at said teacher workstation
(4) to said questions to correct answers,
retrieving and presenting, on the basis of said
comparing step, audio-visual material relating to

questions answered incorrectly, and
monitoring student progress and alerting the teacher
of student need for remedial instruction.
The educational method of claim 1 further comprising
the steps of :


entering assignment answers into the system; and
grading said assignments by comparing the answers
entered into the system with correct answers stored in

the system.
The educational system of claim 2 wherein aid step of
entering assignment answers comprises the step of :


scanning said answers into the system.
The educational method claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3
further comprising the steps of:


printing progress and remedial action notices; and
recording acknowledgements of these notices.
The educational method of any one of preceding claims
1 to 4 wherein said step of presenting material further

comprises the step of :

providing audio instruction using voice synthesis
techniques.
An interactive educational system having a student
station and a teacher station for carrying out the educational

method set forth in claim 1 wherein :

said student station (10) comprises means for
outputting educational information to a user (16, 32),

means for receiving educational input data from a user
(18, 24), means for selecting one of a plurality of

presentation modes, means for processing said
information and data (14) and presenting it at said

student station (10) based on said selection, means
for displaying a plurality of questions, and means for

communicating with said teacher station (40); and
said teacher station (4) comprises means for
transmitting and receiving data to and from said

student station (10), means for analysing a progress
of said user based on said received data, means for

outputting an indication of said progress, means for
monitoring said progress, and means for generating

homework assignments based on said monitored progress.
The interactive educational system of claim 6 wherein:

said means for receiving educational input data from a
user (18, 24) include at least one of a 

touch-sensitive display, a pointing device, a
keyboard, and an optical scanner; and
said means for outputting educational information
to a user (16, 32) include at least one of a

display and an audio output device.
The educational system of claim 6 or claim 7
wherein said teacher station (4) further comprises :


means for storing and retrieving said received
data; and
means for selectively generating at least one
report based on said received data.
The educational system of claim 8 wherein :

said at least one report comprises one of a grade
report and a remedial action notice.
The interactive educational system of claim 8 or
claim 9 wherein :


said means for analysing a progress of said user
includes a database program for storing progress

data in teacher station memory means.
The interactive educational system of claim 10
wherein a teach station processor in said teacher station

(40), upon receipt of a report generation selection input
from at least one teacher station input device, retrieve

said progress data from said teacher station memory means
and directs said means for selectively generating at least

one report to generate at least one report based on said
progress data. 
The educational system of any one of preceding
claims 6 to 11 wherein said student station (10) further

comprises :

means for outputting said educational data as
audio-visual information and questions relating to

said educational data (16, 32);
means for comparing responses received from said
educational input data means to correct responses

(14); and
means for outputting remedial material based on
said comparison.
The educational system of claim 12 wherein said
student station (10) further comprises :


means for outputting additional questions related
to said remedial material;
means for comparing additional responses received
from said educational input data means to

additional correct responses; and
means for notifying said teacher station (40) based
on a result of said comparison.
The educational system of any one of preceding
claims 6 to 13 wherein said means for generating homework

further comprises :
