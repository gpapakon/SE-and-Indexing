<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method and a device for the treatment of mouldings of different polymers. In the case of this method, the mouldings are comminuted by impact loading or comminuted and at the same time disintegrated, and the particles are separated after comminution according to their size and/or shape by a classifying process. The device for carrying out this method comprises an impact pulveriser (2) and linear shaking screen or gyratory screen (8) arranged one behind the other.
