<ABSTRACT>
The method for the fabrication of a curved back projection screen includes coating (212) the screen (200) before forming a sheet into the proper curvature. In one embodiment the sheet includes lenticulations (210) to improve the perceived luminous intensity thereof. Through this method a back projection screen is provided that overcomes the manufacturing difficulties associated with previously known methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD OF BACKSCREEN FABRICATION USING PRE-COATED MATERIALFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention is directed toward a method for the fabrication of back projection screens. More particularly, the invention is directed toward the fabrication of such projection screens using a pre-coated material.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBack projection screens have become increasingly popular. These screens produce images when interposed between the viewer and the projection device. Back projection screens are usually made from a clear acrylic sheet which is coated with a diffusion coating which is usually translucent. The image to be displayed is projected onto the thermoplastic diffusion coating by a projector or the like. The translucent diffusion coating then transmits the image through the clear acrylic sheet where it is viewed by the viewer.Typically, curved back projection screens have been fabricated by forming the acrylic sheet to the proper curvature, for example through blow molding techniques, and then applying the coating material to the formed acrylic sheet. Hence, in the prior art, the coating material must be applied either by use of spraying techniques or by bonding the coating to the sheet after the sheet has been formed to the proper curvature. 

 Further, in the prior art, imperfections often occur during the application of the thermoplastic coating to the curved surface of the sheet. These imperfections often result in a complete loss or expensive rework of the entire part. When the applied coating is substandard the part is usually solvent-stripped and then recoated. The stripping of the coating from the acrylic sheet may result in the loss of the entire part as a result of solvent's effect on the quality of the acrylic sheet. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, this invention is directed toward a method for fabricating a back projection screen which uses a pre-coated acrylic sheet. Pre-coating the acrylic sheet allows the user of the invention to ensure that the coating meets the required specifications prior to forming. The method allows forming of the part without the possibility of marring the coating. The coating is not marred since the screen is formed on a tool having a convex curvature and only the concave uncoated surface of the screen is in contact with the forming tool.The method comprises applying a coating to a plastic sheet, the sheet having first and second planar surfaces, a boundary and a specified thickness. The coating is applied to the first surface. The second surface of the
