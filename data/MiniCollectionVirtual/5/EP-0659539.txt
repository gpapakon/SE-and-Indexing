<ABSTRACT>
Handles (6, 13) made from plastic strip (1) are successively brought, with holes (7) provided in each case at their ends, into a position, in relation to successively supplied containers (9), intended for the fastening of the handles (6, 13). Then in each case an eye (16, 17) is brought in front of a hole, the cylindrical part of which eye has an external diameter corresponding to the diameter of the hole (7) at the end of the handle (6, 13) and has bulges at its end facing the container (9) while its flange is directed away from the container (9). Then, welding electrodes, at the tip of which there are preferably centring pins, are guided against or into the eyes (16, 17) which are thus moved into the holes (7) in the handles (6, 13) until the bulges of the eyes (16, 17) butt against the outer wall of the containers (9), counter-electrodes in each case bearing against the inner side of the containers (9) and a welding current being supplied for bulge welding. The bulge welding is simple, does not affect the handles which are made of plastic and makes subsequent assembly operations superfluous.

A method for fitting bails to containers made of
metal,


in which bail strips (6) made of synthetic material
strip (1) having holes (7) provided at each of their

ends are bent to form a bail (13) and are brought
into a position determined for the attachment in

relation to consecutively supplied containers (9)
and in which
each time a spigot with a flange, whose cylindrical
part has an external diameter corresponding to the

hole (7) at the end of the bail strip (6) and whose
flange is directed away from the container, is

brought in front of each hole (7) of the bail strip
(6),
characterised in that
an ear (16, 17) in the manner of a full tubular
rivet is used as spigot, with a cylindrical part

which comprises, at the edge faced away from the
flange, projections for projection welding and
in that
 each respective ear (16, 17) is introduced
by means of a welding electrode preferably provided

with a centring point into the adjacent hole (7) in
the bail (13) and is forced by its projections

against the container (9), while at the same time a
counter-electrode is brought to abut an internal

wall of the container (9) and welding current is 
supplied for the projection welding of the ears (16,

17) with the container (9).
A method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the bails (13) are formed
directly before fitting on the containers (9), by a

strip of synthetic material (1) being unwound from
a reel and being cut into lengths corresponding to

the length of the bail strips (6) and during or
after the fitting the holes (7) being inserted into

the ends of the cut-to-length portions of the strip
of synthetic material (1) forming the bail strips

(6).
A method according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the formation of the bail
strips (6) or bails (13) and/or the fitting of the

bails (13) to the containers (9) takes place with
the progressive movement of the bail strips (6),

bails (13) and or containers (9).
A device for performing the method according to
Claim 1,
characterised by
transport means for transporting containers (9) made
of metal into an assembly station,
transport means for transporting bail strips (6)
each provided with holes (7) at their ends and bails

(13) formed therefrom to the assembly station, 
aligning means for aligning the holes (7) at the
ends of the bails (13) into a position determined

for the attachment in relation to a supplied
container (9),
supply means for supplying one ear (16, 17) every
time, which comprise a cylindrical part with

projections protruding from the one cylinder edge
and with a flange disposed on the other side, in

front of a hole (7) at the end of a bail (13),
alignment means for aligning the ears (16, 17) in
such a manner that they point with their edge having

the projections to the container (9) situated in the
assembly station,
welding electrodes (18, 19) which at each of their
contact ends have a spigot for centring and mounting

an ear (16, 17),
a feed device for feeding the welding electrodes
(18, 19) with an ear through a hole (7) at one end

of the bail (13) towards an opposite counter-electrode,
and
means of applying a welding current to the welding
electrodes (18, 19) and the counter-electrodes for

the projection welding of ears (16, 17) and
containers (9).
A device according to Claim 4,
characterised by
a reel for a roll of strip of synthetic material
(1),
transport means (2, 3) for supplying the strip of
synthetic material (1) into a length-cutting device

(5) for producing bail strips (6) according to the
length of the bail (13) to be produced and
means for producing a hole (7) at each of the ends
of the bail strips (6) or of the bails (13).
A device according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterised in that
 the transport means (2, 3; 8)
operate progressively.
A device according to Claim 2 or 5,
characterised in that
 direction of transport of the
strip of synthetic material (1) runs transversally

to the direction of transport of the containers (9).
