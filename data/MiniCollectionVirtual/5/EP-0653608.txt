<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating gyroscope (10) includes a vibrator (12). The 
vibrator (12) has a regular triangular prism-shaped vibrating 

body (14), and piezoelectric elements (16a,16b and 16c) are 
formed on side faces of the vibrating body (14). Resistors (26 

and 28) are connected to the piezoelectric elements (16a and 
16b), and an oscillation circuit (30) and a phase correction 

circuit (32) are connected between the resistors (26,28) and 
the piezoelectric element (16c). An opposite phase signal 

against a driving signal is supplied to a ground terminal of 
the vibrator (12). Output signals of the piezoelectric 

elements (16a and 16b) are supplied to a differential circuit 
(36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibrating gyroscope,
and particularly to a vibrating gyroscope for detecting a
rotational angular velocity by utilizing a bending vibration
of a vibrating body.Fig. 5 is an illustrative view showing an example of a
conventional vibrating gyroscope such as e.g. disclosed in US-A-5 111 083. A vibrating gyroscope 1
includes a vibrator 2. As shown in Fig. 6, the vibrator 2
includes a vibrating body 3 having, for example, a regular
triangular prism shape. Piezoelectric elements 4a, 4b and 4c
are formed respectively on three side faces of the vibrating
body 3. The piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b are used for
driving to generate a bending vibration to the vibrator 2,
and for detecting to obtain a signal corresponding to a
rotational angular velocity. The piezoelectric element 4c is
used for feedback when the vibrator 2 is driven. Supporting
members 5a and 5b are attached to a ridge line in the
vicinity of nodal points of the vibrating body 3. The 
supporting members 5a and 5b are formed with metal lead and
the like, and used for ground terminals.Resistors 6a and 6b are connected respectively to the
piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b. An oscillating circuit 7
and a phase correction circuit 8 are connected to the
resistors 6a and 6b. The supporting members 5a and 5b used
for ground terminals are connected to an intermediate point
of source voltage. Output signals of the piezoelectric
elements 4a and 4b are supplied to a differential circuit 9.
In the vibrating gyroscope 1, a driving signal as shown in
Fig. 7 is supplied to the piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b.
The vibrating body 3 bends and vibrates in a direction
perpendicular to the face of the piezoelectric element 4c by
the driving signal. When the vibrating body 3 rotates on its
axis, a vibrating direction of the vibrating body 3 changes
by a Coriolis force. Thus, a difference is produced between
output signals of the piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b. A
signal corresponding to a rotational angular velocity can be
obtained by measuring the difference between output signals
of the piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b by the differential
circuit 9. A rotational angular velocity supplied to the
vibrator 2 can be detected by measuring the output signal of
the differential circuit 9.However, in the vibrating gyroscope, only half voltage
A of maximum source voltage is supplied to the piezoelectric 
elements for driving as shown in Fig. 7, because the ground
terminals are connected to the intermediate point of source
voltage. In the
