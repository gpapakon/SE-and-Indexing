<ABSTRACT>
An attrition mill has a rotor (25) essentially comprising blades (33) and an annular stator (24) surrounding the rotor. The inner surface of the stator (24) is constructed as a rubbing surface (28) tapering in a truncated cone shape from a mixing material entry side (24a) to a mixing material exit side (24b). The width b of sheer gaps (38) formed between the blades (33) and the rubbing surface (28) is adjustable. Immediately adjacent to the mixing material entry side (24a) is arranged a liquid feed device (50).

A grinding mill 

comprising a mill base plate (22, 22') 
comprising a motor (17) connected with the base plate (22, 22') 
comprising a drive shaft (19, 19') coupled with the motor (17) and 
drivable for rotation about an axis (30) 
comprising an annular stator (24) connected with the base plate (22, 
22'), having an inner face (28) arranged concentrically of the axis (30) 

and being open within the inner face (28), and which comprises a 
mixing stock inlet side (24a) facing the base plate (22, 22') and a 

mixing stock outlet side (24b) spaced in the direction of the axis (30) 
comprising a rotor (25, 25') non-rotatably connected with the drive 
shaft (19, 19'), provided with wings (33, 33') which extend as far as 

into the vicinity of the inner face (28), formed to be open between the 
wings (33, 33') and, at the radially extreme ends of the wings (33, 33'), 

having edges (37) which extend substantially parallel to the inner face 
(28) and 
comprising a liquid supply arrangement (50, 50'), the liquid outlet (55, 
55') of which is directed directly into the area of the stator
characterized in
 
that the inner face of the stator (24) is formed as a grinding face (28) which 

tapers in the shape of a truncated cone in the direction from the mixing 
stock inlet side (24a) towards the mixing stock outlet side (24b) and
 
that the liquid outlet (55, 55') of the liquid supply arrangement (50, 50') is 

arranged to be directly adjacent to the mixing stock inlet side (24a) of the 
stator (24). 
A grinding mill according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the grinding 
face (28) is formed to be closed. 
A grinding mill according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
grinding face (28) is inclined in relation to the axis (30) at half an angle of 

taper (a), to which applies: 20° ≤ a ≤ 45°. 
A grinding mill according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
the rotor (25, 25') has a maximum radius (c) and, in the vicinity of its 

radially outer edges (37), an extension (d) in the direction of the axis (30), 
to the relation d/c of which applies:
 
0.4 ≤ d/c ≤ 0.6. 
A grinding mill according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 
the radially extreme edges (37) of the wings (33, 33') each delimit a 

shearing gap (38) towards the grinding face (28). 
A grinding face according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the width (b) 
of the shearing gaps (38) is adjustable. 
A grinding mill according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the rotor (25, 
25') is adjustable in the direction of the axis (30) in relation to the stator 

(24). 
A grinding mill according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the liquid 
supply arrangement (50) comprises at least one spray valve (54) arranged 

directly in front of the mixing stock inlet side (24a).  
 
A grinding mill according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the liquid 
supply arrangement (50') comprises a channel (63) guided through the drive 

shaft (19') and at least one outlet channel (64, 64') which is connected with 
the drive shaft (19') and extends as far as into the vicinity of the grinding 

face (28). 
A mixer comprising a grinding mill according to one of claims 1 to 9, a 
cylindrical receptacle (1) and a mixing unit (6) arranged to be rotatably 

drivable therein, the mill base plate (22, 22') being arranged in a wall (12) 
of the receptacle (1), the motor (17) being arranged outside of the 

receptacle (1) and the rotor (25, 25') and the stator (24) within the 
receptacle (1). 
A mixer according to claim 10, wherein the mixing unit (6) comprises a 
shaft (5) and mixing tools (10) which are connected therewith and are 

rotatably drivable in proximity to the wall (12) of the receptacle (1) and 
wherein the mixing tools (10) can pass between the wall (12) of the 

receptacle (1) on the one hand and the rotor (25, 25') and the stator (24) on 

the other hand.
