<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of a headlamp glass (1) intended to be fitted onto a support, especially a casing of an optical block, including the stage of pressing a gob of glass in a mould (2) so as to obtain a blank (3) larger in size than the headlamp glass (1), and in then cutting the said headlamp glass (1) out of the blank so as to obtain offcuts and a glass which has dimensions and/or shapes which cannot be obtained directly by a moulding operation employing the whole of the glass gob, the glass gob being deposited in the mould so that the defects inherent in the moulding may be found in the offcuts.

A method of fabricating a headlight glass (1) designed to
be mounted on a support, in particular a housing of a

headlight unit, the method being characterized in that it
comprises the step of pressing a drop of glass in a mold (2)

so as to obtain a blank (3) of size that is larger than the
headlight glass (1), and then cutting said headlight glass

(1) out from the blank in such a manner as to obtain scrap
and a glass having dimensions and/or shapes that cannot be

obtained directly by a molding that makes use of the drop of
glass in its entirety.
A method of fabricating according to claim 1, in which
the drop of glass is deposited in the mold in such a manner

that defects inherent to molding from in the scrap.
A method of fabricating according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the blank (3) is dish-shaped having a

substantially flat bottom (3Ã©) and a rim (33) projecting
from said bottom, said glass being cut out from the bottom

(32) of the blank (3) in such a manner as to define a
headlight glass (1) that is substantially flat and lacking

in peripheral skirts.
A mold for implementing the method of claim 1 or claim 2,
comprising a dish-shaped cup (21) having a bottom (211) and

a projecting rim (212), a circle (22) designed to be fitted
on the projecting rim (212), and a punch (23) that is

complementary in shape to the cup (21) and that is adapted
to be received in said cup (21) by passing through the

circle (22), the bottom (211) of the cup (21) and the
corresponding surface of the punch (23) comprising each an

optical treatment zone facing one another to impart the
optical qualities required for a headlight glass to be

molded blank (3) characterized in that said zones are formed 
locally in the parts of the bottom and the surface punch

defining the headlight glass (1) that is to be cut out.
A method of fabricating according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the blank is in the form of a dish

with a projecting rim (33), having a bottom (32) that
presents a depression (4), said depression (4) likewise

having a bottom (41) that is substantially flat and a rim
(42) projecting from the bottom of the dish-shape, said

headlight glass (1) being cut out from the bottom (32) of
said dish-shape at the edge (42) of the depression (4) so as

to define a headlight glass (1) that is substantially flat
and that is provided with a peripheral skirt.
A mold for implementing the method of claim 1 or claim 2,
comprising a dish-shaped cup (21) having a bottom (211) and

a projecting rim (212), a circle (22) designed to be fitted
on said projecting rim (212) of the dish-shape, and a punch

(23) that is complementary in shape to the cup (21) and that
is adapted to be received in said cup (21) by passing

through the circle, characterized in that the bottom has a
depression (4) also comprising a bottom (41) that is

substantially flat and a rim (42) connecting the bottom of
the dish-shape, the substantially flat bottom (41) of the

depression (4) and the corresponding surface of the punch
(23) comprising each an optical treatment zone facing one

another to impart the optical qualities required for a
headlight glass to be molded blank (3).
A mold according to claim 6, in which the bottom (41) of
the depression (4) and the portion of the punch (23) that is

complementary to the bottom (41) of said depression are
surface-treated in such a manner as to confer the optical

qualities required of a headlight glass to said molded blank
(3). 
A method of fabricating according to claim 3 or claim 5,
in which the outline of the glass for cutting out

incorporates fastening tabs (11) for fixing the glass (1) on
a support.
A method of fabricating according to claim 3, claim 5, or
claim 8, in which the glass is oblong in shape having a

length/width ratio that is greater than 4.
