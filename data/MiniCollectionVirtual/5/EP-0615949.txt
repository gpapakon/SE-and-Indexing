<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an industrial scale hydrogen
producing apparatus which manufactures hydrogen from a mixed
gas of steam and either hydrocarbons or methanol through a
steam reforming reaction. More specifically, this invention
relates to an industrial scale hydrogen producing apparatus
for obtaining hydrogen of sufficiently high purity for use
in solid polymer fuel cells (polymer fuel cells) at low
reaction temperatures.The content of CO in hydrogen for fuel cells, in
particular solid polymer fuel cells, is preferably less than
10 ppm. Hydrogen obtained from naphtha, natural gas and
town gas through a steam reforming reaction has low purity
and is not, as it is, suitable for fuel cells. Hydrogen
obtained through steam reforming reactions is often further
refined in a carbon monoxide reformer and a hydrogen refiner
to boost the hydrogen purity to a desired degree.This approach to obtaining high-purity hydrogen requires
complex manufacturing processes. These processes
require high temperature and high pressure equipment and
significant heat energy, with resultant high production 
cost. Hydrogen produced through such processes cannot be
economically used in fuel cells.As disclosed in documents, such as Japanese Patent
Provisional Publication (Kokai) No. 61-17401, proposals have
been made to obtain high purity hydrogen using permeable
membranes which is selectively permeable to hydrogen.The above Provisional Publication, for example, disclosed
a method and an apparatus for continuously separating
generated hydrogen through a selective hydrogen-permeable
partitioning wall, from a reaction space which is at a
temperature of 500-1000°C. This method and the required
equipment can be applied to CH4/H2O reforming reactions or
reactions for producing water gas. The publication
explained that it is possible to separate high purity hydrogen
through this method.Published documents, including the above publication,
disclose a hydrogen producing apparatus on the scale of a
laboratory, with its schematic chart shown in Figure 1. In
the conventional hydrogen producing apparatus shown in
Figure 1, reference numeral 90 indicates the reaction tube,
92 the reforming catalyst layer, and 94 the hydrogen permeation
tube. The mixture of steam and hydrocarbon gas is
introduced from below in the direction indicated by arrow X,
reformed in the reforming catalyst layer 92, and hydrogen
gas is generated. This hydrogen gas permeates the hydrogen-permeable 
tube 94 and flows out from the section marked with
arrow Y. The
