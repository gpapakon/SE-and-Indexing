<ABSTRACT>
The hatch (3), particularly for smoke- or heat-extraction, hinges on a frame (2) under the action of a variable-length actuator (1), which is coupled to it at the opposite side to the hinge. Inside the frame is a swing arm (5), coupled at its free end (E5) to that (E1) of the actuator. Mating fixings (6,7) are mounted on the arm and actuator ends, and are assembled together or separated without any tools being required but form a firm coupling when engaged. When detached, the actuator and arm fold into the space between hatch and frame.
