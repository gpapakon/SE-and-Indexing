<ABSTRACT>
A method of drilling a through-hole for inter-surface 
conduction in a laminate for a printed wiring board, the 

laminate comprising a metal foil attached to an insulating 
material, with a water-soluble lubricant sheet on one surface 

or on front and reverse sides of the laminate, the method 
comprising drilling the through-holes in the presence of a 

water-soluble lubricant sheet which is 0.02 to 3 mm thick and 
is formed from a mixture of 20 to 90 % by weight of a polyether 

ester with 10 to 80 % by weight of a water-soluble lubricant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metbod of 
drilling a through-hole for a double-sided or multilayered 
printed wiring board. US-A-4,781,495 and US-A-4,929,370 
disclose methods of drilling a hole for inter-surface 
conduction in a laminate produced by attaching a metal foil 
on an insulating material, with a water-soluble lubricant 
placed on one surface, or front and reverse sides, of the 
laminate. It is disclosed that these methods use a sheet 
prepared by impregnating paper, etc., with a mixture of a 
glycol such as diethylene glycol or dipropylene glycol, 
which is a solid water-soluble lubricant, with a rigid wax 
such as fatty acid or a nonionic surfactant. As a wax-like hardener component, a fatty acid ester can be used. However, the problem of the above methods is that 
the effect on the prevention of heat generation in a drill 
is insufficient, that a porous sheet is only poorly 
impregnated with the above mixture or that the sheet is 
sticking. JP-A-4-92488 to JP-A-4-92493 disclose methods of 
drilling a hole in a laminate with a specific water-soluble 
lubricant placed on the laminate. It is disclosed that 
in these methods the water-soluble lubricant is selected 
from polyethylene glycol having a weight average molecular 
weight of 600 to 9,000, monoether of polyoxyethylene, ester  
 
of polyoxyethylene, monoester of polyoxyethylene sorbitan 
and a polyoxyethylene-propylene block copolymer. These methods show some improvement, while the 
effect on the prevention of heat generation in a drill is 
not satisfactory. Further, JP-A-4-92494 discloses a water-soluble 
lubricant sheet which is 0.05 to 3 mm thick and is formed from 20 to 90 % by weight of a 
polyethylene glycol having a weight average molecular weight 
of at least 10,000 and 80 to 10 % by weight of a water-soluble 
lubricant. The above water-soluble lubricant sheet shows a 
sufficient improvement in the effect on the prevention of 
heat generation in a drill, while the defect with this sheet 
is that it is liable to break so that it is difficult to 
handle it. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a method of drilling a through-hole for a printed 
wiring board, in which the heat generation in a drill bit 
can be inhibited in drilling holes and quality holes can be 
highly efficiently made. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a method of drilling a through-hole for a printed 
wiring board, in which quality holes can be highly 
efficiently made in the presence of a novel water-soluble 
lubricant

<CLAIMS>
A method of drilling a through-hole for inter-surface 
conduction in a laminate, the laminate comprising a metal foil 

attached to an insulating material, in the presence of a water-soluble 
lubricant sheet on the front and/or reverse side(s) of 

the laminate, wherein the 
water-soluble lubricant sheet is 

0.02 to 3 mm thick and is formed from a mixture of 20 to 
90 % by weight of a polyether ester with 10 to 80 % by weight 

of a water-soluble lubricant. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the water-soluble 
lubricant is selected from at least one of polyethylene glycols having a weight 

average molecular weight of 600 to 9,000, polyoxyethylene monoethers, 
polyoxyethylene esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoesters, 

polyglycerin monostearates, and polyoxyethylene-propylene block 
copolymers. 
A method according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
polyether ester has a melting point or softening point of 30 

to 200°C. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the water-soluble 

lubricant has a melting point or softening point of 
30 to 200°C.
