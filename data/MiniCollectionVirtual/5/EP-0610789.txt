<ABSTRACT>
In order to eliminate bacteria and germs, especially salmonella, in a foodstuff, the elements which guide the product are heated by a heating system in an appropriate installation in such a way that the finished product can be delivered in a form which has a very high probability of being germ-free. The installation shown in Figure 1 has a product feed channel (8), a feeding assembly (2), a mixing assembly (3) and a product inlet channel (7) which of a dicing press (1) delivers the product from the mixer (3) to a pressing mould which is situated inside the casing (6). The product which has been pressed into cubes leaves the installation via the product outlet channel (9) into a cooler, for example. The corresponding heating elements are not shown in Figure 1, but are shown in the other Figures pertaining to the application. These are, however, means of heating up the aforementioned elements by means of convection through the air, electrically induced heat or infra-red radiation. This results in the advantage that a contaminated product can be sterilised shortly before it is stored ready for transport, in which position it only remains for a short time.

Process for eliminating bacteria and other germs in a
feeding stuff by means of a cube compression (1) and/or

expansion plant with a product inlet and product supply duct
(7, 8) with a feed (2) and mixing unit (3), with a compression

mould (4) and with a product outlet duct (9), characterised in
that product guiding units and parts, namely the mixing unit

(3) and, if necessary, adjacent regions of the feed unit (2)
or of the feed inlet duct (8), the product supply duct (7, 7a,

7b), the compression mould (4), and the product outlet duct
(9) are heated by steam-free heating means without spatial

interruption of the heat guidance on the radial circumference
and course of these units and parts and/or uninterruptedly

along the course thereof.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
product supply duct (8) and the feed unit (2) are also heated.
Process according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that
the heating of the units (8, 2, 3, 7, 4, 9) is by hot air,

heating mats, and/or by infrared lamps.
Process according to claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised in
that the product temperature is controlled and regulated.
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the temperature of the product to be

treated is measured and that product which falls below a
predetermined temperature is eliminated. 
Device consisting of a cube press (1) and/or an expansion
plant with a product inlet and a product supply duct (7, 8)

with a feed (2) and mixing unit (3), with a compression mould
(4) and with a product outlet duct (9) for carrying out the

process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that an
air circuit (19, 20, 21, 16, 14, 13, 15) with a fan (19), a

connecting line (20), an air heater (21), a lower air
connection (16) arranged laterally on the product outlet duct

(9) with an air inlet duct (14) and an air outlet duct (13)
with an upper air connection (15) arranged laterally on the

product supply duct (8) is provided for heating the product-guiding
units and parts (8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9), the air being

guided from the product outlet duct (9) via the compression
mould (4), the product supply duct (7), the feed and mixing

unit (2, 3) to the product inlet duct (8).
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the
air heater (21) comprises an inlet (22) and an outlet (23) for

the heating medium for heating the air for the air circuit.
Device according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that a
controller (31) with at least two temperature sensors (17,

18), a control valve (24) associated with the air heater (21)
and for controlling the heating medium, and control and

measurement lines (27, 28, 45) are provided for controlling
and regulating the temperature of the air circuit.
Device according to at least one of claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that additional means are provided for

measuring the temperature of the output product and for
eliminating that product which has not yet reached the

predetermined temperature.
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the
mixing unit (3) is a conditioner. 
Device according to claim 6 or 10, characterised in that
an expander (99) is arranged between the mixing unit (3) and

the product inlet duct (7).
Device for producing feeding stuff cubes or similar
products with a cube compression and/or expansion plant with a

product supply duct (7, 8), with a feed (2) and mixing unit
(3) with a compression mould (4) and a product outlet duct

(9), at least some of these elements being warmed for
eliminating bacteria and other germs, characterised in that

the product-guiding parts of the mixing unit (3), the product
inlet duct (7), the compression mould (4), the product outlet

duct (9) and, if necessary, the feed unit (2) and the product

inlet duct (8) are provided with heating mats in the form of
heating sleeves (62) or heating jackets (63, 64, 65, 66), a

controller (31) being provided for regulating the temperature.
