<ABSTRACT>
A roller bearing has working surfaces, that is surfaces 
where its rollers and races contact each other, which have 

extremely shallow irregularities that are nondirectional and thus 
render the working surfaces isotropic. Moreover, the isotropic 

surfaces have very low average asperity slopes and likewise a 
very low plasticity indexes. To derive the high quality working 

surfaces, the races and rollers are first ground or otherwise 
mechanically machined to provide the working surfaces with the 

proper profiles. Then the races and rollers are immersed in a 
liquid chemical which reacts with the metal at the surfaces and 

contemporaneously forms a protective coating which inhibits 
further reaction. Abrading elements within the chemical come 

against the races and rollers as they are agitated and 
continuously remove the coating from higher elevations of the 

working surfaces, so that the chemical continues to react with 
the metal at those higher elevations. The irregularities 

diminish to very shallow pits of no particular orientation, thus 
leaving the working surfaces isotropic. Thereafter, in the 

absence of the chemical, the protective coating is removed, 
exposing the high quality working surface. The bearing requires 

no run in, that is to say, after the initial loading its torque 
and temperature remain steady at low magnitudes. Moreover, the 

isotropic surface imparts greater fatigue life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for finishing a metal race according to the precharacterized portion
of claim 1 and a rolling element,bearing according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 12.This invention relates in general to antifriction bearings and, more particularly, to such bearings having superior
finishes on their critical working surfaces and a process for providing such bearings.From the standpoint of antifriction bearings, the tapered roller bearing has a rather complex geometry. A single
row tapered roller bearing, which is the most fundamental of that type of bearing, has two races, called the cup and
the cone, each provided with a tapered raceway, and tapered rollers arranged in a single row between the raceways
of the cup and the cone. Generally speaking, line contact exists between the tapered side faces of the rollers and the
raceways. In addition, one of the races, usually the cone, has a thrust rib against which the large ends of the rollers
bear. Indeed, were it not for the thrust rib, the rollers would be expelled from the annular space between the raceways,
since radial loads transmitted through the rollers translate into small axial components which urge the rollers up the
tapers of the raceways - and against the thrust rib.Initial impressions would suggest that the two raceways and the side faces of the rollers should lie in conical
envelopes having their apexes at a common point along the axis of rotation, for this would produce pure rolling contact
between the side faces of the rollers and the raceways. In actual practice, the roller side faces and the raceways have
slightly curved profiles to alleviate edge loading and accommodate eccentricity imparted by the load. Considerable
research nas focused on deriving the ideal configurations for raceways and roller side faces, and algorithms exist for
determining those configurations. See US-A-4,877,340.Apart from that, one would, upon initial consideration, conclude that the large end faces of the rollers should
be squared off with respect to the axes of the rollers. Actually the end faces have a slightly spherical profile, for this
enables the rollers, upon bearing against the thrust rib, to acquire the proper orientation along the raceways.The typical bearing is finished to within close tolerances with a final grind on its critical working surfaces. But
in some bearings, the finishing along the working surface is carried farther to reduce the run-in period for the bearing
and to enable it to operate at lower

higher regions of the working surface so that the chemical reacts with those higher regions,
