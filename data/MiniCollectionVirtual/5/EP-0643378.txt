<ABSTRACT>
The shutters can be actuated in order to modulate an incident beam (L). Microflaps (5) are attached to a substrate by means of attachments opposing their rotation from a rest position. The microflaps (5) are placed on optical paths (X-X), in order to be able to interrupt them or establish them. They are equipped with reflecting surfaces (7) to deflect the light when they are in the shuttering position. An additional reflecting surface (8), a diaphragm (6) and a means of focusing (4) are placed on each optical path (X-X). Thus, according to its position, each microflap can focus the light onto the diaphragm (6) in order to let it through or deflect it so as to block it. Application to the conversion of a beam (L) into a modulated beam (Lm).

Network (1) of miniature light obturators, 
intended more specifically to transform a luminous beam 

(L) into modulated light (Lm) formed by a matricial or 
linear set of points of light, each of such obturators 

being capable of selective activation or disactivation in 
order to allow passage of, or to block the light, said 

network (1) comprising a substrate (9) to which 
microshutters (5; 5A) respectively forming said obturators 

are attached by means of elastic fastenings (12) opposing 
resistance to their rotation away from a predetermined 

rest position, said network (1) also including control 
means (13) for the microshutters for selectively 

controlling the rotation thereof away from said rest 
position, said microshutters (5; 5A) being respectively 

placed in the optical paths (X-X) of said light in order 
to be able to interrupt or to establish said paths in 

accordance with their position, each microshutter (5; 5A) 
further being fitted out with a reflecting surface (7; 7A) 

for deflecting said light when it is in its blocking 
position, said network being characterized in that the 

network comprises, in the optical path (X-X) associated 
with each microshutter (5; 5A), a supplementary reflecting 

surface (8; 8A), a diaphragm (6; 6A) as well as a 
focussing means (4; 4A), the supplementary reflecting 

surface, the diaphragm and the focussing means being 
placed in a manner such that when said microshutter (5; 

5A) is in the one of its positions, the light is focussed 
on said diaphragm (6; 6A) in order to allow such light to 

pass and that the latter is deflected relative to said 
diaphragm (6; 6A) and consequently blocked, when said 

microshutter (5; 5A) is in its other position, in that 
said reflecting surface and the supplementary reflecting 

surface face each other, in that said diaphragm is 
arranged in one of said reflecting surfaces and in that 

said reflecting surfaces are parallel in the rest position 
of said microshutters.  

 
Network of obturators according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said supplementary reflecting 

surface (8) is provided at the center of said focussing 
means (4), and in that said diaphragm (6) is pierced in 

said microshutter (5). 
Network of obturators according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said microshutter (5A) is placed in 

the center of said focussing means (4A) and in that said 
supplementary reflecting surface (8A) is pierced in its 

center by said diaphragm (6A). 
Network of obturators according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said focussing means 

(4; 4A) is a converging lens. 
Network of obturators according to claim 4, 
characterized in that said lens (4; 4A) is a Fresnel type 

lens. 
Network of obturators according to claim 4, 
characterized in that said lens (4; 4A) is a diffracting 

optical element. 
Network of obturators according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said supplementary 

reflecting surface (8) is formed by a specular layer 
deposited at the center of said focussing means (4). 
Network of obturators according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that its microshutters 

(5; 5A) and their control means (13) are micromachined on 
a single silicon wafer (9) extending perpendicularly to 

said optical paths (X-X).  
 
Network of obturators according to claim 8, 
characterized in that said wafer (9) is assembled between 

two transparent plates (2, 3) parallel thereto, possibly 
with interposition of a spacer frame (10), said plates (2, 

3) respectively forming an input plate and an output plate 
for said network, and in that said focussing means (4) are 

micromachined in said input plate (2). 
Network of obturators according to any one of 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that its microshutters (5) 

and their control means (13) are directly micromachined on 
a transparent plate (3) forming an output plate for the 

network, and in that said transparent output plate (3) is
