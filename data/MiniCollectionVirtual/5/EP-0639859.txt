<ABSTRACT>
A packaging substrate (10) is populated with memory chip 
cube(s) (40) and horizontally mounted interconnect chip(s) 

(19) mounted on the substrate which are joined during 
assembly is fabricated with are two kinds of lead tin 

solder alloys used in forming the memory chip cube. One is 
a high melting point lead tin alloy (HMA), another is a 

lower melting point lead tin alloy (LMA). The memory chip 
pairs (11) of the memory cube are formed by placing functional 

memory chips over another functional memory chips 
before they were diced. The chip pads of the individual 

memory chips and the lead tin pads of the memory chips 
within the wafer are aligned and the high melting point 

lead tin solder are reflowed, forming a memory chip pairs. 
The memory cube (42) is formed by joining the memory chip 

pairs together in a boat (30) with a silicon bar (41) maintaining 
spacing during manufacture. The memory chip cube 

(42) as well as the supporting chips are then placed and 
joined to the packaging substrate. The supporting silicon 

bar is removed from the memory chip cube (42) by re-heating 
the cube after it is jointed to the packaging substrate. 

The package is completed by following with capping of the 
chip package of the paired memory chip cube with its 

attached packaging substrate by attaching to the base 
member substrate an appropriate heat sink after appropriate 

I/O flex lines are in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to electrical packaging methods 
and apparatus, and more particularly related to methods and 
apparatus mounting integrated circuit chips vertically to 
form a system module. As background for our invention there have been patents 
related to vertically mounted integrated circuit components, 
as illustrated by Malhi et al, U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,855,809 (8/1989) and 4,922,378 (5/1990). Generally today 
integrated circuits are placed in dual in line packages 
(DIPs) or surface mounted on a printed circuit board. The 
downscaling of devices in memory circuit technology has 
permitted an improvement in the density of memory circuits. 
While significant progress was made in improving the semi-conductor 
technology, the packaging technology has lagged. 
In 1976, Kolankowsky et al in "Silicon Memory Cube," IBM 
Technical Disclosure Bulletin vol.18, No.10, (March 1976) 
pp. 3239-42 described that if the memory chips and the 
supporting chip can be stacked into a cube,the memory performance 
can be improved. In 1978, Henle in "Vertical Chip 
Packaging," IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin vol.20, 
No.11A, (Apr. 1978) pp. 4339-40. described two methods 
to place chip vertically on the top surface of the packaging 
substrate. One method is to use a right angle 
metallic foil to support the chip. Another method is to 
creat a slot on the substrate and then stand the memory 
chip in the slot. In 1989 and later in 1990, Malhi et al 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,855,809 (8/1989) and 4,922,378 
(5/1990) used a technique similar to Henle's slot method to 
place chips vertically on packaging substrate. He chose 
the substrate to be another silicon block or wafer. He 
further proposed to create the slot in the silicon block by 
using chemical etching. The obvious drawback of the slot 
method is the complexity and the inconsistency in creating  
 
a well defined deep slot on the silicon surface and placing 
the chip into the slot. The complexity and the inconsistency 
of the problem addressed by the present invention is 
illustrated by these prior devices,and results from many 
aspects of the manufacture process tolerances. In considering 
packaging of vertically mounted devices,the thickness 
of the silicon memory chip need to be considered, as well 
as the process of placement of the chip in the manufacturing 
process. The problem addressed by the invention is 
to provide the high density memory chips for a computer for 
use in air cooled environment as well as fluid cooled environment.
