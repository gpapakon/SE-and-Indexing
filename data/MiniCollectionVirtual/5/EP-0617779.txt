<ABSTRACT>
Fuel injection nozzles used for reducing NOx in gas turbine engines has incorporated a variety of expensive and complicated techniques. For example, systems use schemes for introducing more air into the primary combustion zone, recirculating cooled exhaust products into the combustion zone and injecting water spray into the combustion zone. The present fuel injector (60, 166) reduces the formation of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides within the combustion zone by controlling the premix air/fuel ratio and more explicitly by controlling the air portion of the air/fuel ratio over the entire operating range of the engine (10). The present fuel injector (60, 166) includes a main body assembly (133), a wrapper member (84) being generally coaxially positioned about the main body assembly (133) forming a device (101) for bleeding a portion of the combustion air therefrom, a housing (150) being generally coaxially positioned about the main body assembly (133) and a portion of the wrapper assembly (84) forming an inlet passage (155) between the housing (150) and the wrapper member (84) and an air/fuel premix passage (156) between the housing (150) and the main body assembly (133). The fuel injector (60, 166) reduces the flow of compressed air into the combustor (42) by providing the device (101) for bleeding a portion of the flow of compressed air exiting a compressor section (22) within the fuel injector (60, 166) and into a combustor (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low 
emission combustion nozzle. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a combustion nozzle for 
controlling the combustible air to be mixed with the 
fuel to control the air to fuel ratio. The use of fossil fuel as the combustible 
fuel in gas turbine engines results in the combustion 
products of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water 
vapor, smoke and particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, 
nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Of these above 
products, carbon dioxide and water vapor are 
considered normal and unobjectionable. In most 
applications, governmental imposed regulation are 
further restricting the amount of pollutants being 
emitted in the exhaust gases. In the past the majority of the products of 
combustion have been controlled by design 
modifications. For example, at the present time smoke 
has normally been controlled by design modifications 
in the combustor, particulates are normally controlled 
by traps and filters, and sulfur oxides are normally 
controlled by the selection of fuels being low in 
total sulfur. This leaves carbon monoxide, unburned 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides as the emissions of 
primary concern in the exhaust gases being emitted 
from the gas turbine engine. Oxides of nitrogen are produced in two ways 
in conventional combustion systems. For example,  
 
oxides of nitrogen are formed at high temperatures 
within the combustion zone by the direct combination 
of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen and by the presence 
of organic nitrogen in the fuel. The rates with which 
nitrogen oxides form depend upon the flame temperature 
and, consequently, a small reduction in flame 
temperature can result in a large reduction in the 
nitrogen oxides. Past and some present systems providing 
means for reducing the maximum temperature in the 
combustion zone of a gas turbine combustor have 
included schemes for introducing more air at the 
primary combustion zone, recirculating cooled exhaust 
products into the combustion zone and injecting water 
spray into the combustion zone. An example of such a 
system is disclosed in U.S.-A-4,733,527. 
The method 
and apparatus disclosed therein automatically 
maintains the NOx emissions at a substantially 
constant level during all ambient conditions and for 
no load to full load fuel flows. The water/fuel ratio 
is calculated for a substantially constant level of 
NOx emissions at the given operating conditions and, 
knowing the actual fuel flow to the gas turbine, a 
signal is generated
