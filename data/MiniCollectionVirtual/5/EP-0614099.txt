<ABSTRACT>
A coated optical fiber unit having at least two coated 
optical fibers (13,14) each of which has a coloring 

layer (12) as the outermost 
layer and which are coated together with a bundling 

coating layer (11), in 
which the bundling coating layer and the coloring layer are both 

treated to suppress their bonding, by which the coloring layer is not 
removed at the same time as the removal of the bundling coating 

layer, the releasing agent added to the bundling coating layer and the 
coloring layer does not swell the resins in the layers, or cause 

peeling of the protective coating layer from the optical fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coated optical fiber 
unit comprising at least two fibers which are coated together with a 
bundling coating layer, and each of which has a protective coating 
layer around an optical fiber. In particular, the present invention 
relates to improvement of a resin of a bundling coating layer and a 
coloring layer. Since an optical glass fiber to be used as an optical 
transmission medium (hereinafter referred to as "optical fiber") has 
a diameter of 150 µm or less usually, and is made of a fragile 
material, namely glass, its surface tends to be easily flawed during 
its production or cable assembling, or storage, and the stress is 
concentrated on the flawed part so that the optical fiber is easily 
broken when an external force is applied thereon. Since it is very difficult to use the optical fiber as such 
as an optical transmission medium, the surface of optical fiber is 
coated with a resin to maintain an initial strength just after the 
production and to be worthy for long term use, and the coated optical 
fiber is practically used. Examples of the conventionally used resinous coating 
material are thermosetting resins (e.g. silicone resin, epoxy resin, 
urethane resin, etc.), actinic ray (UV light)-curable resins (e.g. 
polyepoxy acrylate, polyurethane acrylate, polyester acrylate, etc.), 
and the like. Since these materials are organic materials, it is  
 
known that they suffer from denaturation such as oxidation, or 
deterioration. To prevent denaturation, they are treated to suppress 
the generation of hydrogen gas (H₂) as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
KOKAI Publication No. 113711/1989. To improve the handling easiness and a density of the 
optical fibers, a coated optical fiber unit in which two or more 
coated optical fibers are coated together with a bundling coating 
layer. When the single optical fiber of the coated optical fiber 
unit is fusion connected with an optical fiber or the single optical 
fiber of other coated optical fiber unit, or with a connector, an end 
part of the bundling coating resin should be removed to separate the 
single optical fibers. Each coated optical fiber has a coloring layer 
around the protective coating layer to identify each optical fiber 
when it is separated as above. When a bond strength between the bundling coating resin 
and the coloring layer is larger than that between the coloring layer 
and the protective coating layer, the coloring layer is removed when 
the bundling protective resin is removed, so that the
