<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a feeder (1) for transporting 
particles, comprising a container (5) for receiving particles (3), 

said container (5) having a discharge area; a nozzle (9) having an 
inlet end disposed adjacent said discharge area; and means (19) 

for creating relative motion between said inlet end and said 
discharge area. 
The invention also provides a method of delivery 
particles to a discharge nozzle (26), comprising the steps of 

providing a source of particles; providing a suction nozzle (9) 
which is in fluid communication with said discharge nozzle (26), 

said suction nozzle (9) having an inlet end; moving said 
parti
cles (3) toward a discharge area; moving said inlet end 
relative to said discharge area; aspirating said particles 

into said suction nozzle (9); and conveying said particles (3) 
through a supply line (25) which fluidly connects said discharge (26) 

nozzle to said suction nozzle (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to feeders for feeding particulate material for 
transportation by a transport gas, such material including carbon dioxide pellets or particles, 
powder, grain or other granular type material. The invention will be specifically disclosed in 
connection with a feeder for use with particle blast systems, and more specifically, systems 
utilizing carbon dioxide pellets as the blast media. Feeders for feeding particulate material, such as powder, granular material, carbon dioxide 
into a flow of transport gas are well known in the art. Such prior art units include a container 
for holding the particles to be fed, a suction nozzle mounted on the container with an open inlet 
disposed near the bottom of the container. The suction nozzle is connected to a flow of gas so 
as to create suction at the nozzle inlet. The container is configured so as to direct the particles 
toward and into the inlet end of the suction nozzle. With such conventional feeders, which are constructed in a way only to utilize the suction 
force present at the inlet end of the nozzle to draw in adjacent particles, the suction nozzle can 
become clogged by the particles, thereby reducing the efficiency of the feeder. In some 
instances, the particles become unable to flow into the inlet of the suction nozzle, instead 
collecting in the vicinity thereof. It is object of this invention to obviate the above-described problems and shortcoming of 
the prior art heretofore available.  It is another object of the present invention to provide a feeder for feeding particles into 
a flow wherein the flow of particles is substantially uniform, while preventing the suction nozzle 
of the feeder from clogging up with the particles. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a feeder for transporting 
particles in which the particles do not collect around the opening of the nozzle of the feeder 
thereby interfering with the uniform flow of the particles into the nozzle. It is another object of the present invention to provide a feeder which is simple, can be 
manufactured at lower cost, and in addition, can be easily moved to any given place for use. It is still further object of the present invention to provide a particular blast cleaning 
system which utilizes the improved feeder described herein. Additional objects, advantages and other novel features of the invention will be set forth 
in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art 
upon
