<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing additive composition treated multi-ply tissue products is disclosed. In accordance with the present invention, at least one (1) ply of the tissue product is treated with an additive composition, such as a lotion. Once the additive composition is applied to the tissue product, the tissue is then hot embossed by being fed through, for example, a heated bonding nip. It has been discovered that the hot embossing step improves the adhesion between the multiple plies.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLY BONDED LOTION TREATEDTISSUE AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAMEField of the InventionThe present invention relates to tissue products. More particularly, the invention pertains to multi-ply, additive composition treated tissue products and to a method for making the products. Background of the Invention Consumer tissue products such as facial tissue and bath tissue are generally used to absorb body fluids and leave the skin dry. The tissues are predominantly formed of cellulosic paper-making fibers by manufacturing techniques designed specifically to impart softness to the tissue. Despite specific efforts to select fibers and form the tissues with high levels of softness, these consumer tissue products may still have a tendency to abrade the skin. In an attempt to reduce skin abrasion, additive compositions have been applied to the tissue. The additive compositions, sometimes generally referred to as lotions, function either to provide lubricity causing the tissue to glide across the surface of the skin, or to leave the tissue and be deposited on the skin for a skin health/cosmetic benefit. Additive compositions have been applied to tissues by techniques such as printing or spraying and at levels typically above 1 weight percent to as much as 30 weight percent, based on the weight of the tissue.In the past, however, various problems have been experienced in constructing tissue products with lotions. For instance, lotions tend to cause multi-ply tissues to deply. It is theorized that ply bonding is impaired because these formulations contain oily, waxy, or both oily and waxy components which hinder bonding between the plies. It appears that the lotion may actually interrupt fiber-to-fiber bonding between the plies. Moreover, it is theorized that conventional mechanical ply bonding processes such as embossing and crimping 

are inherently ineffective for ply bonding of lotion treated tissues. Specifically, the tackiness of the lotion tends to cause the outer plies of the tissue to stick to the embossing or crimping rolls, thus separating the individual plies from one another as the tissue exits the bonding nip.A variety of approaches have been employed over the years in an attempt to improve the ply bonding of lotion treated tissues. One approach has been to apply the lotion formulation after the tissue has been ply bonded. While this approach partially improves ply bonding, it continues to have inherent deficiencies because the mechanical forces associated with applying lotion to the tissue may disrupt the
