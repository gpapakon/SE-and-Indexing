A device for providing a rigid mechanical link with frequency cutoff 
between two structures, the device comprising a member for 

transmitting static forces between the two structures (10, 12) and a 
sealed cylinder-piston assembly, the piston (18) of which is secured 

to one structure and the cylinder (16) of which is secured to the 
other structure (12), the device being characterized in that the 

member for transmitting static forces is a tie-rod (14) of high 
stiffness, parallel to the axis of the cylinder-piston assembly, and 

the ends of the tie-rod are secured to the structures (10, 12), and 
in that the device comprises means for generating inertia 

instantaneously opposing the displacement of the piston in the 
cylinder in response to an impulsive or quasi-impulsive acceleration, 

these means comprising at least one duct (22) of small cross-section 
relative to that of the piston (18), the duct interconnecting the two 

chambers formed in the cylinder (16) on either side of the piston, 
and a substantially non-viscous liquid which completely fills the 

cylinder (16) and the duct (22), the cylinder and duct being 
substantially rigid and dimensionally stable under the effect of 

pressure variations, so that the transmission to one of the 
structures of an impulsive or quasi-impulsive acceleration applied to 

the other structure, which causes displacement of the piston (18) in 
the cylinder (16) in one direction, is opposed by the inertia of the 

liquid displaced in the opposite direction in the duct (22), this 
inertia as seen at the piston (18) being equal to the mass of the 

liquid contained in the duct (22), amplified by the square of the 
ratio of the working cross-sectional area of the piston (18) over the 

internal cross-section of the duct (22). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
dimensions of the duct (22) and the ratio of the cross-sectional 

areas of the piston (18) and of the duct (22) are determined as a 
function both of the stiffness of the tie-rod (14) and of an 

excitation frequency, so as to substantially cancel or at least very 
much reduce the transmission of that excitation frequency.  

 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that 
the static pressure of the liquid in the cylinder (16) and the 

aforementioned duct (22) is greater than at least half the total 
amplitude of the pressure variations, so as to avoid cavitation 

phenomena in the liquid. 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
it includes at least two ducts (22, 22') of different dimensions 

interconnecting in parallel the two chambers formed on either side of 
the piston in the cylinder, and controllable means, such as solenoid 

valves (28) for example, for closing one or other of the ducts. 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 

the aforementioned tie-rod (34) passes axially through the 
aforementioned piston (38) and cylinder (40). 
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the piston 
(38) and cylinder (40) are annular in shape and surround the tie-rod 

(34) axially. 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized the tie-rod 
(34) is a cylindrical tube. 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
the aforementioned duct (44) is wound helically around the cylinder. 
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
aforementioned duct comprises a helical groove (44) formed in the 

outside surface of the cylinder (40) and opening at its ends to the 
inside of the cylinder, and a cylindrical envelope (46) secured to 

the cylinder and applied sealingly over the outside surface thereof. 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
it comprises a plurality of pistons (18) slidably mounted in series 

in the same cylinder (16), each piston including a duct (58) of small 
cross-section, the ends of which open out into the cylinder on either 

side of the piston, a plurality of tie-rods (14) connecting the  
 

pistons (18) together and connecting an end piston (18) to an end of 
the cylinder (16) that comprises means for securing to one of the 

structures, securing means passing sealingly through the other end of 
the cylinder (16) for connecting the other end piston (18) to the 

other structure, and a substantially non-viscous liquid filling the 
cylinder (16) and the ducts (58) of the pistons (18), this device 

constituting a low-pass filter as regards the vibratory forces 
applied to one of the structures. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that it comprises a plurality of the aforementioned devices mounted 

in series between the structures to constitute a comb filter, each 
device being tuned to a different low frequency from that of the 

other devices.
