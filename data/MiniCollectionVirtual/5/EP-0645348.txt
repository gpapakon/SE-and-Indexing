<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical glass of a SiO2 - TiO2 - K2O - RO (where R represents Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn
metal elements) system which is free of PbO, has an excellent property against devitrification and has optical constants
of a refractive index (Nd) of about 1.58 - 1.75 and Abbe number (v d) of about 28 - 45.As a glass having the above mentioned optical constants, there is known a silicate glass containing PbO. For coping
with environmental problems arising in the process of manufacturing a glass, however, various glasses which do not
contain a toxic PbO ingredient but instead contain a TiO2 ingredient have been proposed. For example, the specification
of German Patent No. 973350 discloses a silicate glass containing TiO2 and fluorine and the specification of Japanese
Laid Open Patent Publication No. Sho 54-105119 discloses a SiO2 - TiO2 - K2O - BPO4 and/or Al(PO3)3 system glass.
These glasses, however, are insufficient in stability against devitrification. Besides, the former glass is hard to homogenize
in melting due to evaporation of the fluorine ingredient. The specification of USP 4,812,423 discloses a glass of
a SiO2 - TiO2 - Li2O - K2O system.This glass, however, is also insufficient in stability against devitrification.US-A-2 554 952 describes a titania-containing silicate glass having a high refractive index (1.57 to 1.65), with a
composition based on soda-lime-silica glass ( 73 % SiO2, 17 % Na2O, 8 % CaO and 2 % minor ingredients) of which at
least 10 % and up to 30 % of the SiO2 is replaced by TiO2 for increasing the refractive index, part of (up to 12 %) of the
Na2O is replaced by K2O for color improvement and parts of the CaO are replaced by BaO and MgO for color improvement.FR-A-23 20 031 describes an optical glass having a refractive index of 1.65 to 1.75 and Abbe numbers of 26.6 to
33.7 consisting of 36 to 47 % SiO2, 3 to 17 % K2O, 0 to 14 % Na2O, 0 to 2 % Li2O, 6 to 14 % RO (CaO, BaO, SrO), 20
to 30 % TiO2 and as optional components ZrO2 (0 to 3.5 %) and Nb2O5 (0 to 2.5 %).It is, therefore, an object of the invention to comprehensively improve the disadvantages of the prior art optical
glasses and provide an optical glass having the above mentioned optical constants and having an improved property
against devitrification.Accumulated studies and experiments made by the inventors of the present invention for achieving the above
described object of the invention have resulted in a finding, which has led to the present invention, that a desired glass
