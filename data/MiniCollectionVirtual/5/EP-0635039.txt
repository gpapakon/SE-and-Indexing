<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to correction
fluids.Correction fluids for correcting
handwritten, typewritten or photocopy markings
on paper are well known and their performance
characteristics are well defined. Essential
performance characteristics include the ability
to provide a film or coalesced residue on drying
which can both effectively cover erroneous
markings on a paper surface and receive a
corrected marking. Preferably, the film
covering the marking should be strongly bonded
to the paper surface and should also be
sufficiently flexible so that the film will not
be removed under normal conditions of handling.
Additionally, the correction fluid should not
interact with the marking to cause excessive
discoloration of the resulting film (bleeding).
Another important performance characteristic
involves the drying rate of the composition
which should be as rapid as possible so that
corrections can be made relatively quickly.
Normally, commercial correction fluids form
films which are sufficiently dry to receive a 
corrected marking in about 30-40 seconds.Correction fluids typically are a
dispersion, i.e., a suspension of solid
particles in a liquid. When a correction fluid
sits around for some length of time the solid
particles begin to settle, causing the fluid
near the bottom of the container to become more
compact. Compact settling is undesirable
because it is no longer easily redispersed
thereby reducing coverage or the ability of the
fluid to cover markings.Correction fluids typically include
some standard ingredients, including an
opacifying agent, a film-forming polymeric
material, a volatile solvent, and a dispersing
agent. The opacifying agent is the solid that
is dispersed in the fluid and provides the basis
white color which can be toned with other
pigments to provide a correction fluid closely
corresponding to the color of the paper to which
the fluid is to be applied. The film-forming
polymeric material is substantially soluble in
the selected solvent and binds pigment to paper
and helps to form the flexible but solid
covering that remains once the solvent
evaporates. The volatile solvent is a carrier
for all ingredients mentioned herein. The
dispersing agent is included to stabilize the
dispersion, i.e., to help ensure that the
opacifying agent remains uniformly dispersed in
the solvent.Historically, halogenated hydrocarbons
have been the solvents of choice for correction
fluid compositions. Halogenated hydrocarbon
solvents present special advantages primarily
because they have evaporation
