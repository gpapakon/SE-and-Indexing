<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for determining the 
slack in articulated joints and for measuring the steering 
angles of motor vehicles. In motor vehicle service stations devices are provided 
for measuring the slack in the vehicle articulated joints. 
These devices comprise a lower plate and an upper plate 
movable horizontally relative to the lower plate in the two 
perpendicular directions. These devices are generally 
installed in pairs on a vehicle lift, the lower plate being 
fixed to the corresponding runway and the upper plate 
supporting a wheel of the vehicle which is to be checked and 
which has previously been driven onto the lift. To determine 
the presence of any slack in the articulated joints of the 
steering system and to measure its extent, the upper plate is 
made to move relative to the fixed lower plate while 
observing the behaviour of the vehicle during these 
movements, viewing from below with the aid of an electric 
lamp. A drawback of this known device is that it has a rather 
large height (about 7 cm), and as it is generally installed 
permanently on the vehicle lift this can in practice be used 
only for this purpose. Circular ball plates are also known for measuring the  
 
suspension geometry and the wheel steering angles. There are 
also generally mounted on the vehicle lift runways in 
suitable recesses provided within them, so restricting their 
use to this one purpose because of their particular 
configuration and the nature of the functions performed. Hence those vehicle service stations equipped both for 
determining slack and for measuring steering angles must 
necessarily be provided with two vehicle lifts or in any 
event two separate stations, one equipped with the 
accessories of one type and the other equipped with the 
accessories of the other type, with obvious cost and space 
considerations. Alternatively, the accessories for the two different 
measurements could be mounted interchangeably on one and the 
same vehicle lift, but this would require a series of 
operations for installing the appropriate accessories before 
effecting a given type of measurement and their removal after 
making this measurement. FR-A-2571495 discloses a device combining a slack 
determination assembly, comprising an intermediate plate 
which is movable under the action of actuators in two lateral 
orthogonal (x,y) directions with respect to a base or frame, 
with a steering angle measurement arrangement of a rotatable  
 
plate with rotation axis laterally movable (in x,y 
dire
