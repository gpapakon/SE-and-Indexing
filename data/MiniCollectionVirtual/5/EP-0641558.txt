<ABSTRACT>
An oral composition and method is provided that includes a peroxygen compound 
such as hydrogen peroxide, a fluoride-containing anticaries agent and 

a zinc compound such as zinc citrate. The presence of the zinc compound 
inhibits decomposition that ordinarily would be induced by the presence of 

fluoride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dental products for promoting health in the oral cavity.Oral compositions containing both a peroxide and sodium bicarbonate have
been acclaimed by the dental profession, especially through the work of Keyes.
See Keyes et al. "Periodontics and Oral Hygiene", January 1978, pages 51-56.
Formulations based on the Keyes technology, especially the peroxide
component, are particularly prone to decomposition. The literature has reported
considerable research directed at the stability problem. For instance, see U.S.
Patent 3,577,521 (Scheller), U.S. Patent 4,837,008 (Rudy et al), U.S. Patent
4,130,501 (Lutz), U.S. 4,895,721 (Drucker) and U.S. Patent 4,343,785
(Schmolka). A quite successful approach to the problem has involved physical
segregation of the peroxide into a compartment separate from co-reactive
ingredients. U.S. Patent 4,849,213, U.S. Patent 4,687,663 and U.S. Patent
4,528,180, all to Schaeffer, disclose a package with a dual-compartment
respectively storing a peroxide gel and a bicarbonate paste.Related technology is described in U.S. Patent 4,487,757 (Kiozpeoplou) which
describes a toothpaste in a dispenser that physically separates sodium bicarbonate
from acidic ingredients, e.g. citric or ascorbic acids, to prevent contact
therebetween prior to usage. In U.S. Patent 4,788,052, U.S. Patent 4,839,156 and U.S. Patent 4,839,157
(all to Ng et al) are described aqueous hydrogen peroxide gel dentifrices that
can be stabilized by use of a combination of hydrophillic and hydrophobic
fumed silica. Aqueous mouthrinses have been described in U.S. Patent
5,104,644 (Douglas) that contain hydrogen peroxide. Also present at relatively
low concentrations are such additives as zinc chloride, surfactant, sodium
citrate and citric acid. It should be noted that neither the Ng et al nor Douglas
patents include fluoride anions within the suggested compositions. In RO-A-800100249
a toothpaste is described containing inter alia zinc chloride,
magnesium peroxide and sodium fluoride, but no bicarbonate. It does,
furthermore, not disclose a two-composition dental product.From the aforementioned art, it becomes apparent that hydrogen peroxide
compositions should be formulated as simply as possible to minimize potential
interactions between the peroxide and the remaining ingredients.Fluoride anion is known by those skilled in the art as a destabilizing factor in
peroxide gels. The desirability of achieving anticaries protection for oral
products has prompted formulators to seek a satisfactory means to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An oral dental product comprising a first composition comprising:

(i) from 0.1 to 10% by weight of a peroxygen compound;
(ii) a physiologically-acceptable fluoride-containing compound present
in an effective amount to inhibit formation of caries on teeth; and
(iii) a zinc compound present in an effective amount to stabilize the
peroxygen compound against decomposition by the fluoride-containing

compound.

and a second composition comprising from 0.5 to 80% by weight of an
alkalimetal bicarbonate and a physiologically-acceptable fluoride-containing

compound present in an effective amount to inhibit formation
of caries on teeth, the first and the second composition being held in a

separate compartment of a dual-compartment dispenser.
A dental product according to claim 1 wherein the fluoride anticaries
agent is sodium fluoride.
A dental product according to claim 2 wherein the sodium fluoride is
present in a concentration from 0.01 to 5% by weight.
A dental product according to claim 1 wherein the zinc compound is
zinc citrate.
A dental product according to claim 1 wherein the zinc compound is
present in an amount from 0.01 to 10% by weight.
A dental product according to claim 1 wherein the zinc compound is
present in an amount from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight. 
A dental product according to claim 6 wherein the first composition is a
clear gel.
