<ABSTRACT>
A valve head (13) is actuated, on the one hand, by a return spring (15) and, on the other hand, by the rotor (4) of a motor (3, 4) which acts on a nut-and-bolt system (5, 6). The rotor (4) of the motor is axially coupled to a plunger (11) of an electromagnet (10). The valve head (13), the rotor (4) of the motor and the plunger (11) of the electromagnet are thus movable axially in common. In the rest position, and during a breakdown in the power supply, the valve is closed by a spring (15) and the rotor (4) and the plunger (11) of the de-excited electromagnet are axially displaced. In the working position, the plunger (11) is attracted and held in the working position towards a pole piece (20) of the electromagnet and the rotor (4) is also held in the working position in order to adjust the position of the valve head (13) with the aid of the nut-and-bolt system (5, 6).

Linear actuator, comprising an electric motor (3, 4) 
whose rotor (4) acts on a screw-and-nut system (5, 6) for 

displacing the actuated element (7), reset means (15) for 
returning the actuated element in a rest or safety position, 

and an electromagnet (10, 11) for retaining the actuated 
element (7) in working position, said electromagnet 

(10) acting on a movable element (11), the screw-and-nut 
system (5, 6) being coupled to the movable element (11) of 

the electromagnet (10, 11) and capable of being displaced 
axially together with said movable element of the electromagnet, 

characterised in that the rotor (4) of the motor 
(3, 4) is axially displaceable, said nut being constituted 

by said rotor. 
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the rotor (4) is located, in its working position, at least 

approximately in a symmetrical position with respect to the 
stator (3) of the motor for allowing an operation in both 

rotational directions. 
Actuator according to one of claims 1 and 2, comprising 
a control circuit capable of automatically powering the 

motor (3, 4) on restoring the current in the direction of 
displacing the movable element (11) of the magnet (10, 11) 

into working position by means of the screw-and-nut system 
(5, 6). 
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
nut is axially displaceable with respect to the rotor but 

actuated by the latter.
