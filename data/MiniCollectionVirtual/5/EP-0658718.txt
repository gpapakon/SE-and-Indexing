<ABSTRACT>
An optical sensing array (12) and method of operation 
for controlling the acceptance angle of light beams 

(26) which are iteratively strobed in side-by-side 
channels between light transmitters (14) and light 

receivers (16). The light beams (26) in at least a 
pair of channels are directed along axes which are 

intentionally mispointed or squinted. A control 
circuit (100) measures the amplitudes of signals 

produced responsive to light being received by the 
light receivers (16) and compares the ratio of those 

amplitudes to the ratio of predetermined high and low 
amplitude values which provide a threshold window. 

When the ratio of the signal amplitudes exceeds the 
ratio of the window threshold values, an output signal 

is produced indicative of an unsafe operating 
condition. The control circuit (100) further 

maintains the gain of the signals from the light 
receivers (16) to stay within the range of the 

predetermined window threshold values.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to optical sensing
arrays for detecting the movement or intrusion of
objects into guarded zones. Preferred embodiments
relate to optical sensing arrays such as light
curtains of the type that provide protection for human
operators who are working with machines and other
industrial equipment.Optical sensing arrays such as light curtains employ infrared beams to
provide operator safety in a variety of industrial applications. The
optical sensing arrays typically are employed for operator protection
around machinery such as punch presses, brakes, molding machines,
automatic assembly equipment, coil winding machinery, robot operation,
casting operations and the like. The systems employ light transmitters
having light emitting diodes that are mounted at spaced positions along
one side of the guard zone together with light receivers mounted at the
opposite side of the zone. Modulated infrared light beams are strobed 
along separate parallel channels toward the light receivers. When the
beams are blocked by penetration of an opaque object, such as the
operator's arm, the control system shuts the machinery down, prevents
the machine from cycling or otherwise safeguards the operator from
injury, or the machine and/or work piece from damage.In light curtains and other similar optical sensing arrays it is desirable to
control the maximum angle of acceptance, which is the maximum angle
between the transmitted light beam and the light receiver element at
which the system can be expected to properly operate. Relatively large
angles of acceptance are undesirable in light curtains because they make
it more difficult for the control system to properly discriminate between
signals from the light beams and signals from spurious or transient
sources such as light reflections from the work piece or surrounding
environment. Such conditions could cause the control system to detect
the spurious light and produce a false signal that the light beams are
unbroken when in fact objects are penetrating the guarded zone. This is
a highly unsafe condition in that the light curtain system would then not
properly shut down or safeguard the area when the person's arm or
other object penetrates through the light beams.Safety laws and regulations in many states and countries are in effect or
have been proposed requiring that light curtain systems, before they can
be certified for sale and use, meet certain minimum criteria for angle of
acceptance accuracy. Typically the maximum allowed acceptance angles
