<ABSTRACT>
A pushchair comprises a frame onto which is hinged a 
reclinable backrest (24). On opposing sides of the 

reclinable backrest (24) the frame supports arms (20) 
pivotally rotatable in a vertical plane between a first 

position and a second position. Each arm (20) comprises a 
plurality of engaging notches (19) disposed along a path 

(23) along which slide pins (18) protruding laterally from 
the backrest (24). In the first position each arm (20) 

engages with one of the notches (19) the corresponding pin 
(18) protruding from the backrest, so as to block the 

movement of the backrest in a pre-established angular 
position and in the second position disengages the notches 

(19) of the plurality from the pin (18) to allow free 
movement of the backrest. Disposed on the backrest is a 

manual control to engage the arms (20) and move them 
simultaneously between the first and the second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a pushchair with a reclinable
backrest having a centralized device for releasing and
adjusting its angle of inclination.In particular, the pushchair is of the type known as
apushchair which folds up "umbrella fashion", that is to
say with a folding movement in both a lengthwise and
crosswise direction, by suitable articulation of the
frame.A known pushchair of this kind is for example the one
described in the Italian Utility Model patent NÂ° 213.692
on behalf of the same Applicant, to which the reader is
referred for further details. The aforesaid pushchair is
provided with a backrest foldable in a crosswise direction
by means of a plurality of arms articulated in the form of
a parallelogram. Said backrest is moreover angularly
reclinable in a plurality of positions by engagement of
one of its pairs of lateral teeth in a plurality of
notches made in movable arms situated longitudinally on
each side of the pushchair itself.The backrest is adjusted by manually lifting the two
movable arms so as to simultaneously release the teeth
from their respective notches and fitting them into the
notches corresponding to the desired new position. This
obviously involves the need to use both hands and bend
down to the height at which the aforesaid mechanisms are 
located. These operations are not always easy to carry
out, especially whenever one hand is occupied holding a
bag or the baby itself.The general scope of this invention is to obviate the
aforementioned problems by providing a pushchair with
backrest adjustment by centralized control, which makes it
possible to carry out the operations of locking/releasing
and adjusting the angle of inclination of the backrest
with one hand and without bending.This scope is achieved, according to the invention, by
providing a pushchair comprising a frame onto which is
hinged a reclinable backrest, the frame supporting arms on
opposing sides of the reclinable backrest which are
pivotally rotatable in a vertical plane between a first
position and a second position, each arm comprising a
plurality of engaging notches disposed along a path along
which slide pins protruding laterally from the backrest,
in the first position each arm engaging with one of the
notches the corresponding pin protruding from the
backrest, so as to block the movement of the backrest in a
pre-established angular position, and in the second
position disengaging the notches of the plurality from the
pin to allow free movement of the backrest, characterized
by the fact that disposed

Pushchair comprising a frame onto which is hinged a
reclinable backrest (24), the frame supporting arms (20)

on opposing sides of the reclinable backrest (24) which
are pivotally rotatable in a vertical plane between a

first position and a second position, each arm (20)
comprising a plurality of engaging notches (19) disposed

along a path (23) along which slide pins (18) protruding
laterally from the backrest (24), in the first position

each arm (20) engaging with one of the notches (19) the
corresponding pin (18) protruding from the backrest, so as

to block the movement of the backrest in a pre-established
angular position, and in the second position disengaging

the notches (19) of the plurality from the pin (18) to
allow free movement of the backrest, characterized by the

fact that disposed on the backrest are means which have a
manual control element (49) connected to movable elements (37) disposed

on the backrest close to each arm (20) to engage and
move the arms (20) simultaneously between the first and the second

position.
Pushchair as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the first position of the arm (20) is a lowered

position and the second position is a raised position, the
movement between the first and second position occurring

against the action of a spring (22).
Pushchair as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the
fact that

each 
movable element (37) has a kinematic link with the control

element (49) to shift, upon operation of the control
element, between a first position of non-interference and

a second position of interference with the corresponding
arm in which said movable element (37) biases the arm (20)

towards the second position.
Pushchair as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the
fact that each movable element is composed of a tooth (37)

protruding from an element (39) pivoted to the backrest so
as to rotate on command of the control element (49), the

positions of interference and non-interference being
angular positions of the pivoted element.
Pushchair as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the
fact that the kinematic link comprises a tie (41)

connected between the rotatably pivoted element (39) and
the control element (49).
Pushchair as claimed in claim 5, characterized by the

fact that the tie (41) is a flexible cable.
Pushchair as claimed in claim 5, characterized by the
fact that the control element (49) is a handle pivoted to

the backrest so as to move between a rest position and a
tie pulling position.
Pushchair as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the
fact that the movement of the movable element (37, 39)

between the first position of non-interference and the
second position of interference occurs against the action

of a spring (40).
Pushchair as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the frame and the backrest can be folded at

least in a crosswise direction.
Pushchair as claimed in claim 9, characterized by the
fact that the backrest comprises a central body (33)

supporting the control element (49) and connected to
lateral uprights (12) of the backrest by means of pairs of

arms (27, 28) hinged so as to form a double parallelogram
for crosswise folding of the backrest.
Pushchair as claimed in claims 3 and 9, characterized
by the fact that the movable elements (37, 39) are each

disposed close to the pivots between one of the arms of
the pair and the relevant upright (12).
Pushchair as claimed in claims 6 and 11, characterized
by the fact that the cable (41) runs through a housing

(45, 43) made in the body and through said one arm of the
pair.
