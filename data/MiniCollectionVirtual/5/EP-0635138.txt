<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an optical component (1), which comprises preferably two prisms (2, 3) and an intermediate transmission grating (4). The radiation is directed by means of the prisms (2, 3) and the radiation is dispersed or collated by means of a grating (4) with big dispersion to direct the wished radiation wavelengths into wished directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical component. According to prior art there is known optical 
components, such as a lense, a prism, a grating, with 
which optical radiation, such as radiation in the visible 
wavelength range and in the near infrared range 
can be processed, e.g. directed, collated and/or diffused 
into spectral parts. From these optical basic 
components it is known to assemble optical devices for 
processing radiation. A drawback of using separate components, e.g. 
prisms and gratings and arranging them into lensesystems, 
is that carrying out the wished function requires 
an exact optomechanical implementation and also assembling 
and adjusting the apparatus. That is why the 
assembling of optical apparatuses from separate components 
in the mentioned way is very slow and expensive. Other prior art devices are known from WO-A-9 007 723, US-A-4 747 655 and US-A-3 922 089. The object of the present invention is to 
achieve a novel optical component, which eliminates the 
mentioned drawbacks. It is a particular object of the 
invention to achieve a novel component which can be 
used in several different apparatuses for processing 
optical radiation. The features defining the 
invention are set out in claim 1. According to the invention the optical component 
comprises a combination of two or more prisms 
and a transmission grating, which is formed as a compact 
component, in which the radiation is directed with 
the prisms and the radiation dispersion is 
acheived by means of the transmission grating to direct 
the wished radiation wavelengths into one or more wished 
directions. According to the component of the invention  
 
radiation is processed such that it can be diffused 
into wavelength components of the radiation directed 
into wished directions or conversely the radiation 
components coming from several sources can be collated 
into one compact radiation beam. According to one aspect of the invention the 
optical component comprises two prisms and an intermediate 
transmission grating. This configuration is the 
minimum configuration of the optical apparatus to acheive 
the wished features. According to one aspect of the invention the 
transmission grating is a holographic transmission 
grating of volume type. According to one aspect of the invention the 
prisms are identical. This invention has the following advantages. 
The mean advantage of the optical component is that by 
means of this component big optomechanical configurations 
can be constructed, in which among others
