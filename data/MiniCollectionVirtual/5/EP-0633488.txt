<ABSTRACT>
A display is provided which is easy in the fabrication, highly 
resistive to heat 

and ultraviolet ray, and suited for a large-screen. The magnetic fluid 
display 

comprises a magnetic fluid display board (1) having a magnetic fluid 
(4) which contains 

magnetic particles (4A) dispersed uniformly and suspended constantly 
and is filled in a 

space provided between two equally spaced transparent panels (2), 
and an image 

display controlling means (5) for generating selectively in response 
to the data of an 

image signal a matrix of magnetic fields towards pixel areas on and 
across the 

thickness of the magnetic fluid display board. When the magnetic fluid 
in the 

magnetic fluid display board is activated by a desired number of the 
magnetic fields 

determined by the image signal, its magnetic particles are controlled in the 
orientation. Accordingly, a combination of resultant light passing and 

light blocking 
areas of the pixels will is created in the magnetic fluid forming an image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic display and more particularly, a 
magnetic fluid display using a novel magnetic fluid therein and to an image display 
controlling apparatus for use with the magnetic fluid display and its producing 
method. Liquid crystal displays have widely been utilized in calculators, personal 
computers, and television receivers because of its space-saving size and visual 
quality. The display screen of such a known liquid crystal display is somewhat a 
combination of tiny ICs which are too delicate to permit dusts of micrometers in size 
during the production. Therefore, the production of liquid crystal displays is hardly 
guaranteed for high yield, delivering an negligible number of defectives. Generally speaking, the liquid crystal displays in the current market are not 
uniform in the quality and difficult in reducing the cost, suffering from some 
substantial technical problems. In particular, the liquid crystal displays have a disadvantage such that the 
screen is limited to a small size but not a large size because of its difficulty of 
fabrication. It is also admitted that the liquid crystal displays are rather inferior in the 
resistance to heat and ultraviolet ray due to their materials, thus rarely ensuring the 
durability. The applicants of the present invention have developed and invented a novel 
magnetic fluid display which is easy in the fabrication, highly resistive to heat and 
ultraviolet ray, and applicable to a large-size screen, thus eliminating the foregoing 
problems of conventional liquid crystal displays. The magnetic fluid display according to the present invention is intended to be 
used as a large-screen display and more specifically, a on-the-wall display. For minimizing the space of installation on a wall, it is requested for the 
magnetic fluid display to have the thickness reduced to as small as possible not to 
project too much from the installed wall. It is also an object of the present invention, in view of satisfying the above 
request, to provide an image display controlling apparatus for the magnetic fluid 
display in which the behaviour of a magnetic fluid is correctly controlled with the  
 
use of small currents and a method of producing the same. A magnetic fluid display according to the present invention which has a display 
unit carrying a multiplicity of pixel areas thereof arranged variable in the 
transmittance of light with image data, comprises: a magnetic fluid display board 
comprising a magnetic fluid which contains
