<ABSTRACT>
A manipulator (10), usable in particular as palette transfer device, is specified, having a machine frame and a boom which is movable in the vertical direction and in the horizontal direction and on which a coupling element for receiving a gripping device is provided. The boom has a first oscillating crank (S1) which is mounted on the machine frame and is driven to be rotatable about a horizontal axis of rotation and at the free end of which a second oscillating crank (S2) is rotatably arranged and is constrainedly coupled with the first oscillating crank (S1) via a mechanism in such a way that, upon rotation of the first oscillating crank (S1), the coupling element describes a locus curve (11) having substantially linear horizontal and vertical sections. The two oscillating cranks (S1, S2) are preferably constrainedly coupled in such a way that, upon imaginary rotation of the first oscillating crank (S1) about 360 DEG , an essentially quadratic locus curve in a vertical plane results. The device requires only one NC axis to be able to reach any point on the locus curve (11) and is of simple and space-saving construction.

Handling apparatus, in particular pallet moving apparatus, 
with a machine frame (12) and with an extension arm, movable 

in the vertical direction and in the horizontal direction, 
on which is provided a coupling element (18) for receiving 

a gripping device (13), wherein the extension arm has a 
first rocker (S
1
) that is mounted on the machine frame (12) 
and is driven rotatably about a horizontal rotation axis 

(15); and a second rocker (S
2
) is arranged rotatably on 
the first rocker (S
1
) and is positively coupled to the first 
rocker (S
1
) via a first linkage (Z
1
, Z
2
, 16) in such a way 
that when the first rocker (S
1
) rotates, the coupling 
element (18) describes a locus curve (11) in a vertical 

plane, characterized in that the transmittion ratio (i
1
) 
of the first linkage (Z
1
, Z
2
, 16) is 1:4, and in that the 
arm length ratio (k) defined by the quotient of the arm 

length of the second rocker (a
2

axial spacing between the rotation axis (17) of the second 

rocker (S
2
) and the center axis (19) of the coupling device 
(18) - and the arm length (a
1
) of the first rocker (S
1
) 
- which is defined by the axial spacing between the rotation 

axes (15, 17) of the first and second rockers (S
1
, S
2
) - lies 
in the range between approximately 0.09 and 0.25: 


0.09 ≤ k = a
2
/a
1

so that the locus curve comprises considerably linear 

horizontal and vertical portions. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
two rockers (S
1

element (18) describes a substantially U-shaped or L-shaped 

locus curve in a vertical plane.  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
coupling element (18) is rotatably mounted on the second 

rocker (S

in that the coupling element (18) is positively coupled 

to the first rocker (S
1
) via a second linkage (Z
3
, Z
4
, Z

angular position with reference to the machine frame (12) 

remains unchanged.

arm length ratio lies between approximately 0.12 and 0.15. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
arm length ratio lies between approximately 0.125 and 0.135. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
arm length (a
