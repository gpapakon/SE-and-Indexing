<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blends of water-dispersible
polyesters or polyamides with styrene/
hydroxyethyl acrylate or styrene/hydroxyethyl
methacrylate copolymer.Many water-based polymer systems for water-based
inks and overprint varnishes are readily coatable onto
paper, plastic or metal substrates.Such polymeric systems are disclosed in the
following patents:U.S. Patent 4,946,932 assigned to Eastman Kodak
Company discloses water-dispersible polyester and
polyesteramide blends with certain vinyl polymers. The
products are obtained via semi-batch emulsion polymerization
of one or more vinyl monomers in the presence of an
aqueous dispersion of a preformed water-dispersible
polyester or polyesteramide. The product is a milky
latex dispersion having particle sizes in the range of
150 nm to 500 nm.U.S. Patent 4,939,233 assigned to Eastman Kodak
Company discloses an aqueous dispersion comprising a
water-dispersible polyester or polyesteramide and a
vinyl polymer having a majority of repeat units from
vinyl acetate wherein the latex polymer is formed via
emulsion polymerization of the vinyl monomer in the
presence of an aqueous dispersion of the polyester or
polyesteramide. However, some of these polymeric
materials retain an undesirable water sensitivity when
the coatings are dried. This water sensitivity can
result in blocking or transfer of color if the wet 
surface comes in contact with another substrate. Such
sensitivity can also result in total removal of the ink
film from nonporous substrates such as plastic film or
metal foil.EP-A-0 365 388 discloses a blend of a water-dissipatable
polyester material, an acrylic polymer and
a water-dissipatable vinyl polymer, not a styrene
polymer.WO-A-92/02583 discloses a polymer blend comprising
polyesters oder polyester amides and a styrene polymer. In
particular a polymer blend is disclosed comprising:
(A) about 5 to about 75 weight % of at least one
water-dispersible sulfonate group-containing
polyester or polyesteramide,(B) about 25 to about 95 weight % of a styrene
polymer comprising:
(a) about 30 to about 100 weight % of
repeating units from at least one styrene
compound, and(b) up to about 70 weight % of repeating
units from at least one (meth)acrylate
compound.Thus, it is desirable to have water-dispersible
polymeric compositions which exhibit excellent dry- and
wet-block resistance in overprint varnish applications
and/or excellent water-resistance, adhesion and
printability in ink applications.According to the present invention, there is
provided aqueous
