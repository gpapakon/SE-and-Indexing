<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a waste collection device.It is known that collection of municipal solid waste
performed by means of roadside containers entails
considerable disadvantages from the aesthetic and hygienic
viewpoints as well as due to the space occupied by these
containers.In order to obviate these drawbacks, devices have been
devised in which the waste containers are stored in a pit
which is closed at the top by a lid which has pillars for
the insertion of waste; the containers are caused to rise
from the pit only when they must be emptied. Such a device, having the features comprised in the preamble of
claim 1, is known from the document EP-A-480 326.A pit with a pivoted lid for a waste container is known from
US-A-2 528 056.)These devices have excellent functionality, but new
studies have led to the creation of the device to which the
present invention relates.The aim of said device is to maximally facilitate the
operations for emptying the containers, particularly when
they are handled automatically by devices connected to the
collection trucks with a single operator on board.The aim is achieved by a waste collection device
according to the features of Claim 1. The characteristics and advantages of the invention
will become apparent from the following detailed description
of a preferred but not exclusive embodiment thereof,
illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the
accompanying drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a perspective view of the device according
to the invention, with the lid closed and the lifting unit
at its lower stroke limit;figure 2 is a sectional view, taken along the plane II-II
of figure 1;figures 3 and 4 are views, similar to figure 2, of the
device according to the invention with the lid and the
lifting unit respectively in an intermediate position of
their stroke and at the upper stroke limit.With reference to the above figures, the reference
numeral 1 designates a pit provided with a monolithic lid 2
that comprises pillars 3 and 4 that allow users to insert
the waste, optionally in bags, respectively into containers,
designated by the reference numerals 3a and 4a, which will
be described hereinafter.Said lid is pivoted to the upper edge of the pit at 5
and 6, and is kinematically connected to a lifting unit 
contained in the pit, which will be described hereafter, so
as to move between the closed position shown in figures 1
and 2, at the level of the paving 7 that surrounds the pit
1, and the fully open position shown in figure 4.The lifting unit contained in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Waste collection device comprising a pit (1)
provided with a lid (2) that is openable and walkable in

closed position at the level of the surrounding paving (7),
a lifting unit (8-19) that is suitable to move at least one

waste container (3a,4a), which rests on a platform (20)
included in said lifting unit, from a position in which it

is fully inserted in the pit to a position in which it is
fully extracted from it, said lid having a monolithic

configuration and being provided with at least one pillar
(3,4) to allow users to insert waste into the at least one

container, 
characterized in that
 said lid (2) is associated
with an upper edge of said pit (1) by being pivoted (5, 6)

thereto at one of its sides, and is kinematically connected
to said lifting unit (8-19) so as to perform the opening and

closing motions respectively during the ascending and
descending movements of the lifting unit, and in that said

lifting unit (8-19) comprises rising means (8,9) which are
suitable to cause at least part of the rising motion of the

lid before the ascending motion of the platform that
supports the at least one waste container has begun, and to

complete the closing motion of the lid only after said
platform has reached the lower stroke limit.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said rising means comprise a first section (8, 9) actuatable

in a first phase ascending motion for gradually rising the
lid (2) while said platform (20) remains motionless, and a

second section (18, 19) actuatable in a second phase
ascending motion, jointly with said first section (8, 9),

after said lid (2) has opened so as to prevent collision 
with a rising said at least one container (3, 4), said first

and second sections being further actuatable for a two-phase
descending motion also, in a first one of which the two

sections are moving jointly for lowering the at least one
container (3, 4), and a second one in which the second

section (18, 19) remains motionless with said platform (20)
at said lower stroke limit and the first section (8, 9)

moves downward for completing closure of the lid (2).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said first section (8,9) has

actuation means (12,13) and is connected to the lid (2) so
that each movement thereof is matched by a movement of said

lid, said first section being suitable to move rigidly with
said second section (18,19), which includes said platform

(20) for supporting at least one container (3, 4), only
above a certain level with respect to the lower stroke

limit.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first section of the

lifting unit has guides (8e,9e), which are inclined with
respect to the direction of motion and are associated with

wheels (10,11) rigidly coupled to the lid, and has abutment
elements (8c,9c) which are suitable to make contact with

complementarily shaped elements (18c,19c) which are rigidly
coupled to the second section only after a first portion of

the ascending motion to disengage them before the last
portion of the descending motion, so as to move said second

section during contact.
