<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method of producing a thin metal ribbon (5) 
by pouring a molten metal onto the surface of a quench 

roll (1) rotating at a high speed so as to rapidly cool and 
solidify the metal to form the ribbon, separating the 

ribbon from the quench roll and conveying the same to a 
take-up device. A compressed gas (6) is blown tangent to the 

quench roll to separate the ribbon from the quench roll. 
The separated ribbon is sucked and caught by a suction 

conveyor (7) which runs at a velocity greater than the speed 
of production of the thin meal ribbon thereby imparting 

tension to the ribbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for producing a thin metal ribbon by quenching
employing a quench roll. More particularly, the present
invention pertains to novel separation, guiding and
transfer of the thin metal ribbon immediately after being
peeled off the quench roll.In recent years, progress has been made in production
of thin metal ribbons by quenching using a quench roll.
In order to carry out this process industrially, it is
important to be able to wind and take up the quench-solidified
thin metal ribbon into a coil at high velocity.Means for guiding, conveying and taking up a thin
metal ribbon can be broadly sorted into two types: namely,
a first type in which a take-up reel is moved to a region
in the vicinity of the quench roll so that the thin metal 
ribbon is attracted by and wound on the reel, and a second
type in which the thin metal ribbon is conveyed and
delivered to and wound on a take-up reel which is spaced
apart from the quench roll.An example of the first type is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 57-95553, wherein the end of the thin
metal ribbon is magnetically attracted to enable coiling.An example of the second type is disclosed in
Japanese patent Laid-Open No. 1-92716. This apparatus
provides means for storage of the quench-formed thin metal
ribbon, means for detecting the amount stored, and a
control device for controlling the speed of the take-up
roll. In one embodiment a pneumatic suction nozzle is
used for conveying the thin metal ribbon to the storage
section and further to the take-up reel, after the
separation from the quench roll.A ribbon take-up apparatus of the second type also is
shown in Japanese patent Laid-Open No. 57-39030, wherein
an air sucking roll is used.Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-45455 proposes a
technique in which the thin metal ribbon is conveyed from
a quench roll to a take-up reel while being clamped by
clamping means such as a pair of endless belts.Various other methods also have been proposed such as
using a conveyor belt incorporating magnetic means
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-36029), employing a
running ejector (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-151251),
and a pair of pinch rolls carried by a conveyor truck, one 
of the rolls being a brush roll (Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 3-77752).The method disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
57-95553 encounters a problem in that it is not easy to
magnetically attract the leading end of the thin metal
ribbon without fail, because of lack of stability of
