<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a method for ensuring electrical continuity of the screens, when making the electrical connection of bundles (1) of screened electrical cables (3), each of the said screened cables (3) including a metal screen surrounded by an insulating outer sheath. - According to the invention, for each of the said bundles (1):   . each of the said screened cables (3) is stripped, at least partially, by removing the said insulating outer sheath over a stripping region (40); . the said screened cables (3) with their stripped regions (40), are placed in a conducting coupler (28) intended to be connected to the connector associated with the said bundle (1); and . the said screened cables (3) are fastened to the said coupler (28) by means of an electrically conducting fixing means (41) which makes it possible to ensure, in addition, electrical connection between the said stripped regions (40) and the said coupler (28).

Electrical connection element (28) intended for 
electrically connecting screened bundles (1) of electrical 

cables (2, 3), at least some of the said electrical 
cables being screened, the said connection element (28) 

being joined, via one of its ends (29), to a screened 
bundle (1) of electrical cables (2, 3) to be connected 

and, via the other end (34), to a connector associated 
with the said bundle and intended to make the electrical 

connection with an interacting connector associated with 
at least one other bundle of screened cables,
 
its end (29) facing the said bundle being made in the 

form of a tube (30) shaped to receive on its external 
face (43) the screen (10) of the said bundle (1), the 

cables of the bundle passing through the hollow internal 
space of the tube (30), characterized in that the said 

connection element (28) includes an inner tube (31), of 
smaller diameter than the said tube (30), which is fixed 

coaxially to the latter, establishing electrical linkage 
between the two tubes (30, 31), the external face (39) of 

the said inner tube (31) being shaped so as to allow an 
electrical linkage to be made with the screen (6) of each 

of the screened electrical cables (3). 
Electrical connection element (28) according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the said tube (30) and the 

said inner tube (31) are offset with respect to each 
other along their axis (Y-Y), the said tube (30) extending 

beyond the said inner tube (31) facing the said 
connector and the said inner tube (31) extending beyond 

the said tube (30) facing the said screened bundle (1). 
Electrical connection element according to either 
of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the said tube 

has a circular section. 
Electrical connection element according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the said tube has an 

oval section. 
Electrical connection element according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it is made in two  

 
symmetrical parts. 
Electrical connection element according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it includes a transverse 

base plate (35) enabling this connection element to 
be connected to an electrical connector equipped with a 

module holder and with a wiring chamber. 
Connection of screened bundles (1) of electrical 
cables (2, 3), some of the said electrical cables (3) 

being screened and the other electrical cables (2) being 
unscreened, using an electrical connection element (28) 

according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that the unscreened cables (2) pass 

through the hollow internal space (37) of the inner tube 
(31), in that the screened cables (3) pass through the 

space (38) between the said inner tube (31) and the said 
tube (30) and are fixed to the external face (39) of the 

said inner tube (31), and in that the screen (10) of the 
bundle is fixed to the external face (43) of the said 

tube (30). 
The connection of screened bundles (1) of electrical 
cables (2, 3), some of the said electrical cables 

(3) being screened, using an electrical connection 
element (28) according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that the said electrical cables (2, 3) 

pass through the hollow internal space (37) of the said 
inner tube (31), in that the screen (6) of each of the 

screened cables (3) is connected to an individual electrical 
conductor (44), the said individual electrical 

conductors (44) going around the end (46) of the inner 
tube (31) facing the connector and being fixed to the 

external face (39) of the said inner tube (31), and in 
that the screen (10) of the bundle (1) is fixed to the 

external face (43) of the said tube (30).
