<ABSTRACT>
Use is provided of a low-MW (1000-60,000) block copolymer comprising 20-95 mole % of itaconic acid units and 5-80 mole % of vinyl alcohol or vinyl acetate units, as an antiscalant in machine dishwashing operations. The polymer is biodegradable and can be incorporated as ingredient in the main wash machine dishwashing compositions or in rinse aid compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MACHINE DISHWASHING AND RINSE AID COMPOSITIONSField of the inventionThis invention relates to machine dishwashing and warewashing compositions. These compositions are used for the cleaning of house and kitchenwares, such as pots, pans, dishes, cups, saucers, bottles, glassware, crockery, cutlery and other kitchen utensils in automatic dishwashing and warewashing machines. For brevity's sake, these compositions are referred to hereinafter as machine dishwashing compositions. The invention also relates to rinse aid compositions for use in the final rinse step of the washing machine operation.Background of the inventionMachine dishwashing compositions usually contain, as main components, a builder or builder mixture, buffering and/or alkaline agents, and optionally a surfactant, a bleaching agent which may be a chlorine or oxygen bleach, and lately often also enzymes (e.g. protease, amylase, cellulase. Upases and mixtures thereof) . Rinse aid compositions usually comprise an aqueous liquid containing, as major components, a low-foaming nonionic surfactant and an organic chelating agent, e.g. citric acid.It is known that high concentrations of carbonic species during the main wash cycle and final rinse in a dishwasher can lead to the formation of calcium carbonate deposits (scaling) on the washed articles, visible particularly on glasses as white deposit, and also on machine parts, especially the heater elements. Tap water of a relatively high water hardness and insufficient softening in the machine increase the problem dramatically. Other parameters involved in the scaling process are temperature (high temperature increases deposition) and pH (higher pH appears to increase scaling) . This phenomenon can occur with any machine dishwashing product formulation, although to a much 

lesser extent with conventional products based on the highly effective sodium triphosphate builder. In the last few years, however, machine dishwashing product manufacturers have gradually changed over to low-phosphate, non-phosphate and even zero-P product formulations. These products have currently become an important part of machine dishwashing products on the market. Because non-phosphate and zero-P formulations inherently contain less effective builders as phosphate replacements, e.g. citrates, carbonates, zeolites, which also have inadequate scale- inhibiting properties, the risk of scaling with these products is higher than with the conventional sodium triphosphate products.Scale formation on dishes and machine parts is
