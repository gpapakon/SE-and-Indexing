<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a zein-cellulose derivative gum ingredient is disclosed. Preferably, a solution of zein and water at a pH of between about 11.5 and about 12.1 is prepared, containing between about 10 % and about 20 % by weight zein, and the aqueous zein solution is combined with a cellulose derivative such as HPMC to form a zein-coated ingredient. The zein-cellulose derivative ingredient is then used to make chewing gum. The zein-cellulose derivative ingredient has been found to reduce late chew bitterness and harshness in high mint-flavor content gums.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STRONGLY MINT-FLAVORED CHEWING GUMS WITH REDUCED BITTERNESS AND HARSHNESSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to chewing gum, and more particularly to a gum ingredient which has been found to reduce bitterness and harshness in strongly mint-flavored chewing gums.Gums that contain high levels of mint-flavor (high ratios of flavor to base) achieve high flavor impact upon chewing. While this high flavor impact is desired by many consumers, the high flavor level may result in undesirable flavor characteristics later in the chew. These may include bitterness (a true taste) or unpleasant trigeminal effects often described as harshness, sharpness, burning or bite. For simplicity, these trigeminal effects will be referred to as "harshness," keeping in mind that perceptions and descripters will vary from person to person, and that several slightly different phenomenon may be included within this term. These undesirable sensations effec¬ tively limit the level of mint-flavor that may be used in a chewing gum product which, in turn, limits the initial flavor impact.It would be of benefit to be able to use high levels of mint-flavor, or high flavor/base ratios, in gum without the bitterness, harshness, sharpness, burning or bite generally accompanying such high flavor usage levels. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt has been surprisingly discovered that the use of a granulated ingredient containing zein (an alcohol soluble protein obtained from corn) and a cellulose derivative such as hydroxypropylmethyl- cellulose (HPMC) serves to moderate the negative flavor characteristics caused late in the chew by high levels of mint-flavor. The present invention thus includes methods of making chewing gum with high levels of mint- flavor and the unique granulated ingredient, as well as the gum composition using the unique ingredient and the ingredient itself.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGFIGS. 1-4 depict the results of a panel taste test for 12 minutes of gum chewing, comparing gum compositions that were very similar except for the inclusion of a unique granulated product of zein, HPMC and a small amount of sodium hydroxide. FIG. 1 depicts the bitterness rating; FIG. 2 depicts the sharpness/ bite rating; FIG. 3 depicts the harshness rating and FIG. 4 depicts the mint-flavor rating.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTIONUnless specified otherwise, all percents used herein and in the appended claims are weight percents.

WE CLAIM:
1. A method of producing high-impact mint-flavor chewing gum comprising the steps of: a) preparing an ingredient comprising zein and a cellulose derivative and b) mixing the zein-cellulose derivative ingredient in a chewing gum formulation comprising about 5% to about 95% gum base, about 5% to about 95% bulking agent and about 0.1% to about 10% of a mint- flavoring agent.
2. The method of Claim 1 wherein the cellulose derivative is selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) , hydroxymethyl¬ cellulose (HMC) , hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) , ethyl- cellulose, methylcellulose, sodium hydroxymethyl¬ cellulose, carboxy methylcellulose and combinations thereof.
3. The process of claim 1 wherein a food grade base and the zein are first mixed together in an aqueous solution which is then used to coat the cellulose derivative.
4. The method of Claim 3 wherein the coating step is select from the group consisting of spray drying, fluid bed coating, coacervation, granulation, agglomeration and combinations thereof.
5. The method of Claim 3 wherein the solution contains about 0.1% to about 3% sodium hydroxide.
6. The method of Claim 3 wherein the solution comprises about 10% to about 20% zein. 


 7. The method of Claim 3 wherein one portion of the cellulose derivative is first hydrated and mixed into the solution and the mixture is then mixed with a second portion of the cellulose derivative in powder form to form a heavy paste which is then dried and ground to pass through a U.S. standard 60 mesh sieve.
8. The method of claim l wherein the zein- cellulose derivative ingredient is added to the gum composition at a level of about 0.02% to about 1% of the gum composition, based on zein and cellulose derivative content of the ingredient.
9. A high-impact mint-flavor chewing gum composition comprising: a) about 5% to about 95% gum base, b) about 5% to about 95% bulking agent, c) about 0.1% to about 10% mint-flavor and d) an effective amount of an ingredient comprising zein and a cellulose derivative to reduce bitterness and harshness during chewing of the gum.
10. The chewing gum composition of claim 9 wherein the bitterness reducing ingredient comprises about 0.02% to about 1% of the gum composition, based on the zein and cellulose derivative content of the ingredient.
11.

 12. The chewing gum composition of claim 9 wherein the zein-cellulose ingredient further comprised a food grade base.
13. The chewing gum composition of claim 9 wherein the zein-cellulose derivative ingredient comprises zein and the cellulose derivative at a ratio of between about 5:1 and about 1:5.
14. The chewing gum composition of claim 9 wherein the zein-cellulose derivative ingredient comprises zein, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and sodium hydroxide.
15. An ingredient for reducing bitterness and harshness in high-impact mint-flavor gums comprising: a) zein and b) a cellulose derivative selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) , hydroxymethylcellulose (HMC) , hydroxypropyl¬ cellulose (HPC) , ethylcellulose, methyl¬ cellulose, sodium hydroxymethylcellulose, carboxy methylcellulose and mixtures thereof; the ratio of the zein and cellulose derivative being between about 5:1 and about 1:5
16. The chewing gum ingredient of claim 15 wherein the ratio of zein to cellulose derivative is between about 1:1 and about 1:4.
17. The chewing gum ingredient of claim 15 wherein the ingredient further comprises about 0.1% to about 10% of a food grade base. 


 18. The chewing gum ingredient of claim 15 wherein the ingredient contains less than about 8% moisture.
19. The chewing gum ingredient of claim 15 wherein the ingredient is sized to pass through a U.S. standard 60 mesh sieve.
20. The chewing gum ingredient of claim 15 wherein the zein coats the cellulose derivative.
