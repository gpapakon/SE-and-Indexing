<ABSTRACT>
A gaming system (10) is provided including a central game processor (12), a plurality of master processing units (14) and a plurality of slave terminals (16) operable by players to play the game. The central game processor (12) communicates with the master processing units (14) and supplies the various games available to the system. The masterprocessing units (14) store and administer the games as they are played on the slave terminals. A preferred game includes a fixed pool of game plays and a predetermined number of winning plays within each pool. Each player, through his or her slave terminal (16), can purchase plays in each fixed pool stored in the master processing unit (14) to which that unit is coupled. When a particular pool is exhausted, for example, through the purchase of all plays, the central game processor (12) provides another fixed pool of plays to that master processing unit to enable continuous play.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video lottery games
and other video games of chance, and in particular, to a
video gaming system providing games including a fixed
pool of game plays and a predetermined number of winning
plays within each pool.Lottery games where a player purchases a
printed ticket and gambles on winning a prize or sum of
money are known in the art. Lottery games of this type,
however, generally require little or no skill on the part
of the player to play the game. At most, some minimal
physical act may be required of the player to reveal a 
preordained outcome included on the ticket. The outcome
of the ticket has likely been determined in advance of
the purchase, usually at the time the tickets are
printed. In these games, a player can determine
immediately whether the ticket was a winning ticket by
simply examining the face of the ticket.Other lottery-type games that require
additional, non-skilled acts on the part of the player
are also known. These games may involve the scratching
of a removable surface deposited on the face of the
ticket in order to reveal whether the ticket constitutes
a winning hand. The information printed on the ticket
will usually also indicate the amount of any prize won.
In paper pull-tab versions of this type of lottery game,
the player may peal back or tear off a paper covering to
determine if the ticket was a winner. Even this version
of the lottery ticket, however, lacks a sense of
competition between other players or any feeling that a
player can affect the outcome of the game.The recent proliferation of the video game has
provided greater reach or marketability for such lottery
or gambling devices. Video games of chance, such as
video poker or video black jack, are examples of such
video gambling machines. These video games are very
accessible and can be installed in bingo parlors or
gambling halls so that many players can play at one time.Even where these video lottery games or
gambling devices have succeeded in attracting more
players, they also have lacked an element of competition
whereby a player can compete not simply against a
machine, but against other players as well. Such
competition would provide an element of thrill to the
known lottery game, or even require a degree of skill
from a player. In the prior paper lottery systems or
video gambling machines, the player essentially competes
against the machine and has no indication that other
players are also competing to win the same or different prizes. What is lacking, therefore is a lottery game

<CLAIMS>
A gaming system network comprising:

a memory device (74,76) operative to store a
fixed pool of game plays, the fixed pool containing a

predefined number of winning and losing play records
for respective game plays wherein each game play

record contains an indication of whether the
particular play constitutes a winning or losing play

and the amount won;
a master processing unit (14,70) coupled with the
memory device (74,76), the master processing unit

operative to distribute game plays from the fixed pool
of game plays so that any game play from the fixed

pool can be used only once;
a communication interface (80) coupled to the
master processing unit (70);
a plurality of slave terminals (16), each slave
terminal being coupled to the communication interface

(80) to receive a game play record for a game play
