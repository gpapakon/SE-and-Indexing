<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for checking a camshaft (4), in particular for checking the parameters of the profiles of cams (5-12), comprises means (3, 19, 20, 21) for positioning and axially rotating the shaft, first checking elements (27-39) for determining radial dimensions of cams (5-12) in the course of the rotation, second checking elements (40-47), distinct from the first, for cooperating with a reference portion of the shaft (4) and locating an angular reference position, a rotary transducer (26) for defining said angular position and angular detection positions, and a control unit (63) for receiving and processing signals arriving from the checking devices and from the rotary transducer. For each cam there is memorized (74) and processed (75) a sequence of values (h(i)) pertaining to its profile, there is calculated (76, 77) the value (xBF) of the mutual phase difference with respect to a nominal profile (T), and the actual profile to be checked (H) is inspected with reference to a second nominal profile (T') determined by angularly displacing the nominal profile (T) of an angle equal to the value (xBF) of the calculated phase difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for checking 
geometric and dimensional characteristics of a shaft with 
cams, comprising a support structure with elements for the 
support and the mechanical reference of the shaft that 
define a longitudinal geometric axis, drive means, checking 
means, coupled to the support structure, comprising first 
checking elements adapted to cooperate with the outer 
surface of the cams and providing signals responsive to the 
radial dimensions of the cams, scanning means, and a 
memorizing, processing and display unit, connected to the 
checking means and to the scanning means, for processing 
said signals responsive to the radial dimensions of the 
cams. 
The invention also relates to a method for checking the 
features of a shaft with cams, in particular parameters 
regarding the profiles of the cams, by means of an 
apparatus with checking elements, comprising the steps of 
generating mutual rotational displacements between the 
shaft and the checking elements, detecting, in the course 
of the rotation, by means of first checking elements, 
measurement values relating to the radial dimensions of the 
shaft that define actual profiles of said cams, and 
calculating values of deviation between the measurement 
values and the values of corresponding nominal profiles, 
for checking said parameters. Among the dimensional inspections that are normally 
carried out on a camshaft for an internal combustion  
 
engine, in addition to the simple dimensional and geometric 
characteristics of the main journals and the cams, nowadays 
there are also those for checking other parameters of the 
cam profile as, for example, the slope and the slope 
variations of the profile. Inaccurate values of these 
parameters may, in fact, affect the running of the engine 
where the shaft is fitted, and cause, in particular, the 
improper opening and/or closing of the associated valves. 
In turn this may produce, for example, violent impacts 
between valves and valve seats, thereby causing noise, wear 
and damage to the valves and/or the detrimental emission of 
combustion components and consequently the dispersion of 
pollutants into the atmosphere. In order to be in a position to fully evaluate the 
above parameters, it is necessary to gain information 
pertaining to the profile trend of each cam. A method and a device for measuring the profile of a 
cam are disclosed in British patent GB-A-1273479, wherein 
the radial dimensions of a cam placed in rotation are 
measured at specific angular
