<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a pipe disconnector having a throughflow housing (1) which exhibits a supply line and a discharge line (2,3) and in which a central chamber (5) is arranged between a spring-loaded supply valve and a spring-loaded discharge valve, the two spring-loaded valves are each equipped with a valve disc (4) and a cage (41) which exhibits a guide part (43) for fixing it radially in the throughflow housing (1) and a seat collar (42) for fixing it axially therein, the end surfaces of the two cages (41) being designed as a valve seat. In order to be able to use identically designed parts for the two spring-loaded valves, which exhibit different loading springs (44,45), without it being possible to confuse the two non-return valves and use them incorrectly, the throughflow housing (1) is designed such that in each case only the supply valve can be installed into the supply line (2), and only the discharge valve can be installed in the discharge line (3), of the central chamber (5).

System separator comprising a flow casing (1) fitted with
a feed port and a discharge port, in which a spring-loaded feed

valve and a spring-loaded discharge valve are disposed with an
intermediate chamber (5) arranged between the two valves, and

the two spring-loaded valves (4; 4'; 104; 104') each have a
valve plate and a cage, which has a guide element for radial

fixation in the flow case (1) and a seat collar for axial
fixation, characterized in that the two spring-loaded valves (4;

4'; 104; 104') are composed of identically formed parts (41, 42,
43, 46, 47; 41', 42', 43', 46', 47'; 141, 142, 143, 146, 147;

141', 142', 143', 146, 147'), but include different loading
springs (44,45), and that a sealing face each is provided on the

side of the seat collar and and the side of the guide element
(43, 43'; 143, 143') of the valve cage (41, 41'; 141, 141') and,

in addition, that the flow casing (1; 101) is designed in such a
way that only the feed valve (4; 104) may be mounted in the

inlet (2; 102) and only the discharge valve (4; 104) may be
mounted in the outlet (3; 103) of the intermediate chamber (5;

105).
System separator as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the flow casing (1; 101) includes a shoulder (11; 111) at

the inlet (2; 102) in continuation of the flow opening of the
valve cage (41; 141), whose distance (L1) from the cage seat is

larger than the length (L2) of the guide element (43; 143), but
is smaller than the length (L2) of the guide element (43; 143)

and the thickness (L3) of the valve disk (4'; 104'), and that a
stop (6; 61) is provided at the outlet (3; 103) in the direction

of the valve disk axis at a distance from the closed-position
valve disk (4'; 104') which is smaller than the sum of the

opening travel (H) of the valve disk (4; 104) and the solid
length (B) of the spring (44, 45), but is larger than the

opening travel (H) of the valve disk (4; 104).
System separator as claimed in one or more of the claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the stop (6) is disposed in the

centre of the outlet (3).
System separator as claimed in one or more of the claims
1 to 3, characterized in that at least the spring-loaded valve

(104') at the outlet (103) is disposed at an angle with respect
to the intermediate chamber (105).
System separator as claimed in claim 4, characterized in
that the two spring-loaded valves (104, 104') are seated in an

oblique position in the flow casing (101).
System separator as claimed in claim 5, characterized in
that the intermediate chamber (105) includes an opening (117)

capable of being closed by a lid (112), whose surface is at
least large enough to cause the projection of the surfaces

receiving the check valves (104; 104') to be located in the
direction of the axis of the guide pins (146; 146') within the

opening (117).
System separator as claimed in one or more of the claims
4 to 5, characterized by the fact that the wall of the casing is

formed so as to act as a stop (51).
System separator as claimed in one or more of the claims
1 to 2, 4 to 7, characterized in that the outlet (3; 103) is

conducted in the direction of flow downstream of the check valve
(4; 104') at an angle to the valve axis in such a way that the

wall of the casing extends at a distance from the closedposition
valve disk (4; 104') which is which is smaller than the

sum of the opening travel (H) of the valve disk (4; 104) and the
solid length (B) of the spring (44, 45), but is larger than the

opening travel (H) of the valve disk (4; 104).
System separator as claimed in one or more of the claims
1 to 8, characterized in that a safety retaining ring (7) each 

is provided to fix the valves (4, 4'; 104, 104') in the flow
case (1; 101).
System separator as claimed in one or more of the claims
1 to 9, characterized in that the two front faces of the cage

(41, 41'; 141, 141') are formed as valve seats.
System separator as claimed in claims 9 or 10, characterized
in that a shoulder (144, 144') is provided between

the seat collar (142, 142') and the guide element (143, 143') of
the cage (141, 141'), whose diameter D
k
 is larger than the
inside diameter D
s
 of the safety retaining ring (7) when in a
compressed state as required for assembly.
