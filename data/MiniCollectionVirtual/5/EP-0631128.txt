<ABSTRACT>
The gas investigating arrangement contains a measurement chamber in which the gas is passed along a measurement path parallel to an optical beam. The chamber has a gas inlet (19) and outlet (20) arranged at its ends and wrt the beam so that the flow directions at the inlet and outlet make defined angles wrt. the beam direction. The input of a bypass channel (22) is coaxial with flow direction in the inlet. The output of the bypass channel is coaxial with the flow direction in the outlet. The angles between the flow and beam directions are at least approximately 90 deg.

<CLAIMS>
Device for examining a gas, having a measuring
chamber (10) which, together with a radiation source

(13) and a radiation sensor (14), forms an optical
measuring section (18), and in which the gas to be

examined is led, over a predetermined distance,
essentially parallel to optical radiation (12), having

an inlet (19), arranged at one end of the measuring
chamber (10), and having an outlet (20), arranged at

the other end of the measuring chamber (10), for the
gas to be examined, the inlet (19) and the outlet (20)

being arranged in relation to the optical radiation
(12) in such a way that the direction of flow (24) in

the inlet (19) and the direction of flow (25) in the
outlet (20) are each at a predetermined angle (26, 27)

to the direction (11) of the optical radiation (12),
characterized in that an entrance (21) of a bypass (22)

is arranged opposite the inlet (19) as a continuation
of the direction of flow (24) prevailing in the inlet

(19), the exit (23) of the said bypass being located
opposite the outlet (20) as a continuation of the

direction of flow (25) prevailing in the outlet (20).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the angle (26, 27) is fixed at approximately 90Â°.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the bypass (22) has a cross-sectional narrowing

for fixing that part volume flow (30) of the gas to be
examined which occurs in the bypass (22). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a quartz bar (15, 15') is provided at at least one

end of the measuring chamber (18).
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that heating (16, 16') is provided for the quartz bar

(15, 15').
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that a diaphragm (17, 17') is arranged between the

measuring chamber (18) and the quartz bar (15, 15').
Use of the device characterized in Claim 1 for
examining gases having non-gaseous constituents.
Use according to Claim 7, an exhaust gas from a
combustion operation being provided as the gas to be

examined.
Use of the device characterized in Claim 1 in a
meter for examining exhaust gases from a diesel

internal combustion engine.
