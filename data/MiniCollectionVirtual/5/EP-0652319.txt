<ABSTRACT>
The machine for treating socks with a well-defined heel 
includes a carousel (1) on which multiple pairs of tubular 

templates (2a, 2b) are distributed peripherally; respective 
pairs of men's socks are meant to be fitted on the 

templates. The carousel is suitable to be actuated stepwise 
at a station (4) for fitting the pairs of socks on the 

tubular templates, at least one station (5,6) for treating 
the socks, and a station (7) for removing the pairs of socks 

from the templates, in which the socks are paired together. 
The templates (2a, 2b) are adapted to alternately be 

arranged in a single plane, for example at the fitting 
station (4) and a drying/pressing station (6), or in 

respective parallel planes, for example at the removal 
station (7) and a steam-fixing station (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for treating 
socks, particularly men's socks with a well-defined heel. It is known that in the manufacture of men's socks said 
socks are subjected to appropriate heat treatments before 
being sent to packaging. In particular, the socks are 
generally subjected to pressing and/or fixing treatments. 
Appropriate infrared-ray devices are used for example to 
perform pressing, whereas pressurized steam chambers are 
particularly used to perform fixing, which gives the fabric 
a permanent deformation. Machines for drying and pressing men's socks are 
currently known which are constituted by a carousel provided 
with appropriate templates over which said socks are fitted 
and stretched. The socks fitted on the templates are carried 
by the carousel inside a fixing chamber, for example of the 
steam type, and then inside a drying and pressing chamber, 
for example of the infrared-ray type; the socks are then 
removed to be sent to the further packaging steps. The socks are fitted, treated and removed individually 
from said carousel and therefore must be appropriately 
paired during packaging. This operation is hindered by the 
fact that the socks that are obtained are not all perfectly 
identical, since they assume lengths that are generally 
different as a consequence of the heat treatments they have 
undergone. Accordingly, the personnel must manually select 
the socks to be paired, with an obvious increase in 
production costs related to labor and an evident limitation 
of the productivity of the plant. The fact of operating individually on the socks in the  
 
above mentioned carousel furthermore entails considerable 
space occupation and proportionally high construction costs 
in comparison with productivity. Due to a hitherto undisputed technical prejudice, the 
templates used to treat men's socks are constituted by a 
solid profile having the contour of the socks to be 
produced; said profile is formed for example by an elongated 
metal plate that shapes the contour of the foot at its top. 
The sock is fitted manually over the template by the 
assigned personnel, who then stretch it uniformly and also 
check for the presence of any defects. The sock is instead removed automatically from the 
template in an appropriate station arranged downstream of 
the provided treatment stations. The steps for fitting the socks on the corresponding 
templates and for removing them -from said templates are 
rather difficult and require the application of a certain 
force to

Machine for treating socks with a well-defined 
heel, characterized in that it comprises: a carousel (1) on 

which multiple pairs of tubular templates (2a, 2b) are 
distributed peripherally, respective pairs of socks being 

meant to be fitted on said templates, said carousel being 
suitable to be actuated stepwise at a station (4) for 

fitting said pairs of socks on said tubular templates; at 
least one station (5,6) for treating said socks; and a 

station (7) for removing said pairs of socks from said 
templates in which said socks are paired together. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said templates are constituted by respective tubular 

elements (2a, 2b) which are appropriately bent so as to 
form, in an upper part, the contour (2c) of the foot which 

shapes the heel (2d), the longitudinal extension of said 
foot being tilted at an angle of no more than 25o with 

respect to the longitudinal axis of the respective template. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said tubular templates (2a, 2b) are supported so that they 

can move with respect to each other between a spaced 
position, in which they are arranged substantially on a same 

vertical plane, at said sock fitting station (4), and a 
position in which they are mutually adjacent on parallel 

planes, in order to remove said socks in pairs in said 
removal station (7). 
Machine according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said pairs of tubular templates have a first template (2a) 

that is rotatably supported about a vertical axis on said 
 

carousel and a second template (2b) which is rigidly coupled 
in fixed position on a vertical plane that is substantially 

tangent to said carousel, said templates being arranged 
symmetrically with respect to one another, in said spaced 

position, so as to have a corresponding contour in the 
mutually adjacent position. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said tubular templates are suitable to be fed with 

compressed air which is meant to exit through multiple holes 
(32) formed at the top of said templates, so as to produce a 

jet that is suitable to direct the corresponding end of said 
socks towards pick-up means (33) provided in said removal 

station. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said removal station has means (33) for gripping the top of 

said tubular templates and for lifting the end of said 
paired socks, said means having at least one pair of arms 

(34) that are oscillatable on a horizontal plane, have a 
corresponding pad, and can be actuated so as to mutually 

open and close on supporting means (35) which are meant for 
alternating vertical sliding, said pads being meant to clamp 

said tubular templates at an upper part that forms the 
contour of the foot. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said sock treatment stations comprise at least one fixing 

station (5) inside a chamber (9) which is supplied with 
steam and in which said pairs of tubular templates are 

arranged in a position in which they are mutually adjacent 
on parallel planes. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
 

said sock treatment stations comprise at least one pressing 
station (6) inside a chamber (14) provided with infrared-ray 

lamps (15), in which said pairs of tubular templates are 
arranged preferably in a spaced position in which said 

templates are arranged substantially on a same vertical 
plane.
