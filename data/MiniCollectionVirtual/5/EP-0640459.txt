<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an injection unit 1 for injection machines for processing thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers and silicone plastics, in which the plastication unit 2 has a screw which is arranged in a screw barrel 3 and can be driven in a rotary manner for the metering movement, and in which the axial injection movement of this screw relative to the screw barrel 3 can be effected by a feed drive engaging at the rear end of the screw - at the screw shaft 14. In order to provide a simple design for the injection unit 1, the metering drive 16, 17 for the screw or screw shaft 14 includes the coupling piece of a screw coupling 15, which has its axial and, if appropriate, also its radial counterbearing on the feed drive 19. This feed drive 19 comprises a hydraulic piston/cylinder unit 20, 21, 11, whose piston rod 21 forms the support for the coupling piece, while the piston 20 of this piston/cylinder unit 20, 21, 11 is supported hydrostatically in the injection cylinder 11 of the feed unit 19.
