<ABSTRACT>
Absorbable composite materials are described that comprise 
a collagen matrix reinforced with a layer of a bioabsorbable 

polymer. A chemotherapeutic agent is dispersed in the 
composite material. The layer of bioabsorbable polymer is 

preferably a woven, nonwoven or knitted mesh layer of a 
synthetic bioabsorbable polymer such as 

polylactic/polyglycolic acid copolymer, or oxidised 
regenerated cellulose. The chemotherapeutic agent may be an 

antibiotic, an anaesthetic, an antiseptic or an anti-inflammatory. 
Strips of the composite material are inserted 

into the periodontal pocket, where they are retained in 
place and provide effective sustained release of the 

chemotherapeutic agent over an extended period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of absorbable composite materials in the 
form of a strip or film for the preparation of medicaments for use in the treatment of 
periodontal disease. "Periodontal disease" is the term commonly used to describe inflammatory disease 
of the periodontium (tooth-surrounding tissue). It is a widespread disease in mammals, 
particularly humans, and chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD) is the major 
cause of tooth loss in adults. CIPD results from the accumulation of dental plaque in the gingival crevice, i.e. the 
gap between the gingiva and the tooth which is normally about 1mm deep. The epithelial 
attachment to the tooth forms a barrier between the external environment in the mouth and 
the tooth-supporting tissues. An increase in dental plaque leads to gingivitis, and 
successive inflammatory reactions cause the progressive erosion of the tooth-supporting 
tissues which are the collagenous fibres and the bone socket in which the tooth sits. This 
erosion is manifested by an enlargement of the gingival crevice which may become many 
millimeters deep. Treatment of CIPD has traditionally been focused on the destruction or removal of 
the bacterial plaque whose accumulation perpetuates the disease. This is commonly 
practised by one or both of two approaches: surgical intervention and non-surgical 
treatment. The surgical approach comprises reflecting the gingival tissue to expose the 
tooth root in order that mechanical removal of the plaque may be accomplished directly, by 
e.g. scraping, the use of ultrasonics or laser methods. Following this debridement, the 
gingival tissue is sutured back in position. This procedure is time-consuming, painful and 
requires substantial specialist resources. The non-surgical approach usually comprises limited mechanical debridement (e.g. 
scraping and irrigation) via the entrance to the periodontal pocket, followed by antibacterial 
chemotherapy. This chemotherapy may take the form of systemic antibiotics, of which 
tetracyclines and  
 
imidazoles are commonly used, or the localised application 
of the antibacterial agent via the periodontal pocket. In 
addition to antibiotics, antiseptics such as chlorhexidine 
can be introduced to the periodontal tissues in this manner. 
Advantages of the local administration of antibacterial 
agents are the relatively higher concentrations achievable 
in the periodontal tissues, compared with those obtained by 
systemic therapy, and also a decreased risk of producing 
bacterial
