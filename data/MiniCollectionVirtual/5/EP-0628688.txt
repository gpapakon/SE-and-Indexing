<ABSTRACT>
A bearing part, serving preferably as a bearing part (1) on a fixed frame, of a bearing for the at least pivotable mounting of a sash/leaf, of a window, of a door or the like on a fixed frame or a second sash/leaf is provided with three bearing eyelets (5, 6, 7) which are preferably arranged at the same distance from one another. Moreover, it has two fastening extensions (15, 16) on the rear side of its basic body (4). Located on the third or central bearing eyelet (7) is a securing device (19) for a bearing bolt (3) which is plugged into all the bearing eyelets. Pivoting a securing member (20) of the securing device (19), of which the two arresting extensions (24, 25) engage into an assigned annular groove (27) of the bearing bolt (3), achieves a reliable connection of said bearing part to a second bearing part (2) via the bearing bolt (3).

A mounting for at least rotatably mounting a movable leaf of a 
window, a door or the like on a fixed frame or a second movable leaf, with 

a mounting member (2) for the movable leaf and with a mounting member (1) 
for the fixed frame, with three mounting eyes (5, 6 and 7) which are 

arranged on a main body (4) in displaced relationship in the direction of 
the axis of rotation, for receiving a mounting pin (3), wherein the 

mounting member (2) for the movable leaf has two mounting sleeve portions 
(30, 31) which are displaced in the longitudinal direction of the axis of 

rotation of the mounting and which engage respectively between the central 
and an outer mounting eye (7, 5; 7, 6) of the mounting member (1) for the 

fixed frame, with slight axial clearance, characterised in that in the 
region of the third mounting eye (7) the mounting pin (3) has an annular 

groove (27) with which there is associated a securing member (20) which is 
mounted rotatably in the central mounting eye (7) and whose axis of 

rotation extends transversely with respect to the mounting axis and whose 
first rotational position is a release position for the mounting pin (3) 

in the longitudinal direction of the axis of the mounting while a second 
rotational position which is displaced with respect thereto, preferably 

through about 90°, is a locking position for the mounting pin (3), in 
which at least one locking projection (24, 25) engages into the annular 

groove (27). 
A mounting according to claim 1 characterised in that disposed 
at the rear side of the main body (4) at least in the region of the outer 

mounting eyes (5, 6) is a respective fixing projection (15, 16), in 
particular a fixing pin whose mounting axis extends perpendicularly to the 

axis of rotation of the mounting. 
A mounting according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that two fixing bores (11, 12; 13, 14) for the main body (4) are 

respectively disposed between each two adjacent mounting eyes (5, 7; 7, 
6).  

 
A mounting according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the securing member (20) is rotatably mounted in a 

radial bore (21), which is reduced in a step-wise manner in an outward 
direction, in the third mounting eye (7), and is axially supported against 

the step in the radial bore (21). 
A mounting according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
mounting or radial bore (21) for the securing member (20) is disposed on 

the region of the third mounting eye (7), which is most remote from the 
main body (4). 
A mounting according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the securing member (20) has two locking projections 

(24, 25) which are displaced through 180° and which form a longitudinal 
groove (26) whose cross-section is in the form of a circular arc, the 

radius of the arc approximately corresponding to that of the full cross-section 
of the mounting pin (3). 
A mounting according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the peg-like portion (22) of the securing member 

(20), which projects into or passes through the reduced part of the radial 
bore (21) of the third mounting eye (7), is provided with a slot (28), a 

cross slot or the like. 
A mounting according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the mounting member (1) is of a symmetrical 

configuration relative to a notional central transverse plane. 
A mounting according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the first mounting member (1) has a drilling pattern 

which is identical to the drilling pattern of another mounting mounted 
symmetrically relative to the centre of the vertical frame member, at the 

rotary axis side, of the fixed frame.
