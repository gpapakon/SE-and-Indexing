<ABSTRACT>
To enable management by a center of data transferred
to a user terminal from the center, use is made of an ISDN

which has a call connecting means which forms a signal
channel before forming a data channel between a user

terminal and center and enables user to user transfer of
data on that signal channel. In a control routine, control

data regarding data management which prohibits or releases
copying or reediting between a center and user is

transferred between the center and user terminal. The
data, after transfer to the user terminal, can also be

managed from the center.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the management of data in a 
data communication system using, for example, a 
communication line. At the present time, as means for preventing the 
transfer to other parties of data, music, video and other 
software obtained by a user from a data storage apparatus 
of a data center (hereinafter referred to as "data etc."), 
use has been made of a method of burying control data 
relating to the data management such as the prohibition of 
copying or reediting (hereinafter referred to as the 
"control data") in the data etc. at the time of transfer of 
the data etc. from the data center to the user terminal and 
a method of deliberately scrambling the data etc. and 
giving at the same time decoding data. The methods of transfer of control data and deliberate 
scrambling and giving decoding data are performed using a 
communication channel (hereinafter referred to as a data 
channel) after that communication channel is formed between 
the user terminal and the center in the same way as the 
transfer of the data etc. In the above-mentioned methods, it is not possible for 
the data center to manage the data etc. after transfer to 
the user terminal. Therefore, up to now, there has been 
the problem that the data center could not determine if the 
data etc. was being copied or reedited or the deliberately 
scrambled data was being maliciously restored. An embodiment of the invention described hereinbelow 
seeks to resolve the above problem and provide a method and 
system enabling a data center to manage the data etc. 
transferred to a user terminal. The present invention takes note of the fact that in 
an ISDN (integrated services digital network), a signal 
channel is established between the user terminal and the 
data center before the formation of the data channel and 
that there is a control routine relating to call connection  
 
enabling transfer of user-user information on that channel 
and therefore enables control data relating to the data 
management, such as prohibition or release of copying or 
reediting, to be transferred between the data center and 
the user terminal in the control routine. As a result, in 
embodiments of the invention, it is possible for the data 
center to manage the data etc. after transfer to the  
 
user terminal. Therefore, according to the present invention, there 
is provided a data management system and method in a data 
communication system which has a control means or step 
which, when performing communication between a first 
communication
