<ABSTRACT>
A first surface (46a) of a diaphragm (46) is exposed 
to high temperature gas in the combustion chamber of an internal 

combustion engine. The curvature of the diaphragm (46) changes 
in response to the gas pressure. Three optical fibers (40, 42, 

44) are spaced along a radius of the diaphragm (46) and have 
ends which face a second surface (46b) of the diaphragm (46). 

A light source (50) injects light into a center fiber (40), 
which is displaced from the center of the diaphragm (46) by 

a predetermined distance. Outer fibers (42, 44) receive light 
from the center fiber (40) after reflection from the diaphragm 

(46). The relative intensities of light reflected from the 
diaphragm (46) into the outer fibers (42, 44) correspond to 

the curvature of the diaphragm (46) and thereby to the pressure. 
The outer fibers (42, 44) have a larger numerical aperture than 

the center fiber (40), and the light source (50) fully populates 
all of the optical modes of the center fiber (40) to reduce 

modal noise caused by physical perturbation of the fibers (40, 
42, 44). A computer (56) computes the pressure in response to 

the relative reflected light intensities. A temperature sensor 
(58) provides an input to the computer (56) which enables 

compensation for variation of the sensitivity of the diaphragm 
(46) with temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the art of
optoelectronic sensing, and more specifically to an
improved fiber optic sensor for sensing the pressure in a
high temperature, high pressure environment such as the
combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine.U.S. Patent No. 4,799,751, entitled "DETECTION DEVICE
USING FIBER OPTIC TECHNIQUES", issued Jan. 24, 1989 to V.
Tekippe, discloses a pressure sensor such as illustrated in
FIGS. 1a to 1c and 2 and designated as 10. The sensor 10
includes a flexible disc or diaphragm 12 having an upper
first surface 12a which is exposed to a pressure to be
sensed.Light is injected into the lower end of a first or
center optical fiber 14 as indicated by an intensity I0, and
propagates upwardly through and is projected by the fiber
14 onto the second surface 12b of the diaphragm 12. The
light path through fiber 14 to the diaphragm is indicated
by hatching. Second and third outer optical fibers 16 and
18 are spaced on the opposite sides of the fiber 14. The
fibers 14, 16 and 18 are parallel, at least at their upper
end portions which are adjacent to the diaphragm 12.Light which emerges from the upper end of the fiber 14 
is reflected from the surface 12b and enters the upper ends
of the fibers 16 and 18 as indicated by downward directed
arrows. The reflected light propagating through the fibers
16 and 18 is designated as intensities IIN and IOUT respectively.The center of the inner fiber 14 is spaced from the
center of the diaphragm 12 by a distance x. The fiber 16
is radially inward of the fibers 14 and 18. Preferably, x
= r/31/2, where r is the radius of the diaphragm 12. At this
point the radial slope of the diaphragm 12 exhibits a
maximum and provides the sensor 10 with maximum sensitivity.
The upper ends of the fibers 14, 16 and 18 are spaced
from the surface 12b of the diaphragm 12 by a distance y
and are perpendicular to the diaphragm 12 when the diaphragm
12 is flat.FIG. 1b illustrates the case in which the pressure P
which is applied to the surface 12a of the diaphragm 12 is
zero, and the diaphragm 12 is flat. The upper ends of the
fibers 14, 16 and 18 are all spaced from the diaphragm 12
by the distance y, and the same amount of light is reflected
from the surface 12b of the diaphragm 12 into both
fibers 16 and 18 such that IIN = IOUT.FIG. 1a illustrates the pressure P as being greater
than zero. The diaphragm 12 is curved by the applied
pressure such that the surface 12b which faces the fibers
14, 16 and 18 is convex. Since the fibers 14, 16 and
