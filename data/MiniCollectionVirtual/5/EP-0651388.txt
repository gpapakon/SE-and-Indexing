<ABSTRACT>
A spindle control circuit of an optical disk drive 
capable of performing a high precision and high stability 

spindle control by preventing an off-control even if the 
rotation speed is shifted from a predetermined linear 

velocity such as when a spindle starts rotating or during 
a search. First and second band-pass filters are 

provided having a narrow band and a broad band, with the 
center frequency of the band being set to the center 

frequency of a wobble signal picked up from an optical 
disk. An output of the second band-pass is selectively 

outputted until a lock state is detected, and an output 
of the first band-pass filter is selectively outputted 

after the lock state is detected. A linear velocity 
control is performed in accordance with a selected output 

of the first and second band-pass filters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spindle control
circuit of an optical disk drive, and more particularly
to a spindle control circuit of an optical disk drive for
performing a constant linear velocity (CLV) control in
accordance with a wobble signal.In a conventional optical disk drive, a spindle
control for controlling the rotation of a spindle motor
so as to maintain the rotation of an optical disk at a
constant linear velocity is performed in accordance with
a wobble signal picked up from the optical disk. An
optical disk is recorded with an FM modulated signal
having a carrier frequency of 22.05 kHz and a frequency
deviation of +/- 1 kHz, as data of 3150 bit/s at a biphase
clock of 6.3 kHz. A wobble signal can be detected
from a rotating disk as a tracking push-pull error.
Center frequency components of the wobble signal are
detected, and a spindle control is performed in
accordance with detected control information. In order
to realize a high precision spindle control, the control 
information is derived from the wobble signal by using a
narrow band (high Q) band-pass filter BPF. If the center
frequency of the wobble signal shifts to the outside of
the band of BPF such as when a spindle starts rotating or
during a search, no output is obtained from BPF. It is
therefore necessary to control the spindle rotation at a
high precision by using an external FG signal and pick
position information until the center frequency of the
wobble signal enters the band of BPF.Fig.3 is a block diagram showing the structure of a
spindle circuit system for a conventional optical drive
system. A reproduction signal is picked up from an
optical disk 1 by a pickup 3. A wobble detector 4
detects a wobble signal from the reproduced signal. The
detected wobble signal is supplied to a band-pass filter
5 to obtain information for the spindle control. A CLV
controller 8 performs a constant linear velocity (CLV)
control in accordance with the control information from
the band-pass filter 5 and a standard clock from a
standard clock generator 9.A pick position detector 13 detects pickup position
information from a reproduction signal picked up by the
pickup 3. An FG detector 14 detects FG information from
a spindle motor 2. A rotation detector or controller 15
receives the picks position information, FG information, 
and standard clock signal, and outputs a spindle control
signal for the rotation control.A selector 10 controlled by a micro-processor 12
selects a control signal from the rotation controller 15
until a
