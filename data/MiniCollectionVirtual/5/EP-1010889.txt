<ABSTRACT>
A turbocharged V type engine can be equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation cooler
integrated into the intake manifold, so as to achieve efficiency, cost reductions and space

economization improvements. The cooler can take the form of a tube-shell heat exchanger that
utilizes a cylindrical chamber in the air intake manifold as the heat exchanger housing. The

intake manifold depends into the central space formed by the two banks of cylinders on the V
type engine, such that the central space is effectively utilized for containing the manifold and

cooler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine air intake manifold, and particularly to an intake
manifold having an intercooler supported within a cavity formed in the manifold.This invention further relates to an engine air intake manifold having an intake
manifold and an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) cooler supported within a cavity formed in
the manifold.Some diesel engines employ turbocharger systems and exhaust gas recirculation in
order to meet performance, fuel economy, and emission requirements. Typically exhaust gas
recirculation is used during low to mid speeds, and while the engine is under partial load.
Exhaust gas recirculation is often controlled by an electronically actuated exhaust gas
recirculation valve located between the exhaust manifold and the intake manifold.In some cases an exhaust recirculation gas cooler (intercooler) is added to lower
exhaust gas temperatures for enhanced oxides of nitrogen (NOx) reduction. The exhaust gas
cooler may be located either upstream or downstream from the exhaust gas recirculation valve.
Engine coolant can be used in the cooler to cool the recirculating exhaust gas.The present invention incorporates the exhaust gas recirculation cooler into the intake
manifold. Exhaust gas recirculation passages are integrated into the intake manifold and
cylinder heads to eliminate external exhaust gas recirculation passages. In a preferred
embodiment of the invention, the air intake manifold has two side extensions that form covers 
for the valve- actuation rocker arms. This arrangement eliminates the need for separate rocker
arm compartment covers.The invention achieves some cost reductions when used on turbocharged V
configuration internal combustion engines. Various housings, brackets, clamps, tubes, seals,
fasteners, and gaskets are eliminated, resulting in some savings as regards materials and
installation expenses.Additionally, the location of the cooler and exhaust gas recirculation valve within the
intake manifold minimizes noise transmission to the surrounding environment, since the gas
passages are buried within the manifold and are insulated by water jackets which dampen
sound energy. The gas passage system is somewhat simplified so that adequate gas flow rates
can be achieved without excessive pressure losses.In preferred practice of the invention a venturi system is provided in the intake
manifold for assimilating the recirculating exhaust gases into the airstream flowing into the
intake manifold. The venturi system promotes a high gas flow rate for enhancing
