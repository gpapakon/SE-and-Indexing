<ABSTRACT>
A sign assembly 10 is formed by attaching several 
modules 12,14,16,18 together. Each module 12-18 includes a 

lamp assembly 90,92 for back lighting the sign display, and 
has walls 21-24 with a plurality of dovetail grooves 26 in 

their exterior surfaces. Double dovetail unions 34 engage 
the dovetail grooves 26 in abutting walls 22,32 of a pair of 

modules 14,16 to fasten those modules together. Other 
dovetail unions 56 fill in exposed grooves or fasten a frame 

19 around the perimeter of the sign assembly. Each module 
has a wiring assembly with connectors 74,76 at each corner 

so that adjoining modules can be electrically 
interconnected. This enables electricity to be externally 

applied to only one module 14 of the assembly with the other 
modules 12,16,18 receiving electricity directly or 

indirectly from that one module 14.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to back lighted display 
signs, and more particularly to such signs which are formed 
by modules that can be combined side-by-side to form a wide 
variety of different sized and shaped sign assemblies. Above a counter in fast food restaurants, there is 
often a large sign presenting the menu and prices of food 
items offered for sale. Typically, these signs consist of a 
number of panels with each panel displaying a different 
category of items. For example, one panel may list hot 
sandwiches, with another panel for cold sandwiches, and yet 
another panel listing beverages and desserts. A panel may 
also display a photographic reproduction of a food item 
being offered for sale as a way in which to create customer 
interest. Quite often these signs are back lit with the 
lettering and photographic image being translucent to emit 
light. Because the display area varies from restaurant to 
restaurant, and because of a need to create a distinctive 
appearing sign for various restaurants, modular sign systems 
have been devised. Previously, such signs were created by 
side-by-side combinations of a number of square modules 
having a frame which contain light bulbs over which a 
translucent message panel was mounted. Such square units 
could be combined in horizontal and vertical lines, or in a 
two-dimensional array to form different sized and shaped 
sign assemblies. Often, the individual modules of the sign assembly had 
to be attached together so that the entire display could be 
suspended from a ceiling or mounted in some other fashion as 
a single unit. It is therefore desirable to provide a 
mechanism by which the different modules can be attached to 
one another without visible fastening mechanisms or the need 
for special tools. Furthermore, since each module contains 
its own lamp assembly, a mechanism for supplying electrical 
current to each module has to be provided. It is  
 
undesirable to have a separate external cord for each module 
as the number of such cords because of the numerous cords 
that would extend from a large sign assembly. It is also 
desirable to provide a mechanism by which a trim frame can 
be attached around the perimeter of the assembled sign in 
order to create a decorative appearance to the overall sign 
and set it apart from its surroundings. US-A-3934365 describes a modular sign assembly in which 
two modules each having a plurality of walls, are abutted 
wall-to-wall and each contain a light bulb for illuminating 
a respective display
