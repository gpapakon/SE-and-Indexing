<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel intermediates which may be used in a process for
producing enyne derivatives. More particularly, it
relates to intermediates which may be used in a process for producing enyne derivatives
which are useful for the preparation of compounds showing
strong inhibiting activities against squalene·epoxidase
of Eumycetes and thus being useful as anti-Eumycetes
agents (typical example being Terbinafine: J. Med. Chem,
27, 1539 (1984)), compounds selectively inhibiting
squalene·epoxidase of mammals and having strong anti-cholesterol
activities (substituted alkyl amine
derivatives; Japanese Patent Application No. 296840/1988)
and their precursors. Moreover, the present invention relates to a process for producing such intermediatesHeretofore, the following methods have been known for
the preparation of acetylene-conjugated allylamine
derivatives. J. Med. Chem., 27, 1539 (1984) and
Tetrahedron, 41, 5685 (1985) disclose a method for
producing an acetylene-conjugated (E)-allylamine
derivative by reducing with Dibal (diisobutylaluminum
hydride) a conjugated 1,3-diynyl amine obtainable by 
coupling a terminal acetylene of a propargyl amine
derivative with a bromoacetylene in the presence of
copper chloride, or by subjecting a 1,3-diyne, a
secondary amine and paraformaldehyde to Mannich reaction.Tetrahedron Lett., 3145(1979) also discloses a method
for obtaining an enyne derivative by a similar method.
However, in these methods, at the same time as the
formation of the desired product, a diene derivative is
produced as a by-product in substantially the same amount
as the desired product. Therefore, silica gel
chromatography is required for the separation, and the
yield of the (E)-enyne derivatives is low.J. Med. Chem., 27, 1539 (1984) and the sections for
starting materials in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publications No. 123177/1982, No. 146580/1983, No.
208252/1983, No. 23841/1988 and No. 313753/1988 disclose
processes wherein an acetylene compound is lithiated with
n-butyl lithium and then reacted by 1,2-addition with
acrolein to obtain a secondary alcohol, and then an
aqueous hydrogen bromide solution is reacted thereto to
obtain a bromo derivative of an enyne, and then it is
reacted with an amine. However, in these methods, the
product is a mixture of E:Z = 3:1. In order to isolate a
desired (E)-enyne amine, silica gel chromatography is
required.In Tetrahedron Lett. 29, 1509 (1989), a secondary
amine is lithiated at -78°C, then propargyl bromide is 
reacted thereto to obtain a
