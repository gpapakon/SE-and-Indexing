<ABSTRACT>
A methanediphosphonate derivative represented by general formula (1), wherein R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ represent each independently 
a pharmacologically acceptable cation, hydrogen, or C₁-C₄ linear or branched alkyl; R₅ represents hydrogen or 

trialkylsilyl; m represents an integer of 0 to 3; n represents an integer of 1 to 3; R₆ and R₇ represent each independently hydrogen 
or alkyl; X represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy or alkylthio. This compound is excellent in anti-inflammatory 

effect, antipyretic and analgesic effects or the effect of ameliorating bone anomaly caused by rheumatism, arthritis, osteoporosis 
and so fo
rth, thus being useful as anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic and a remedy for bone metabolism disorder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel methane
diphosphonic acid derivatives, useful as pharmaceuticals
such as an anti-inflammatory drug, antirheumatic drug, bone
metabolic disease drug and so forth, and its production
process.Compounds having a diphosphonate structure are known
for use as anti-inflammatory drug, antiarthritics and so
forth according to, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 59-42395, Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 58-174393 and Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 58-174394.
Moreover, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
No. 60-174792 contains a description to the effect that 1-substituted-amino-1-substituted-thioalkylmethylene
diphosphonate is effective as an antirheumatic drug. In
addition, clinical studies have been conducted using sodium
(1-hydroxyethylidene)bisphosphonate as a drug for treatment
of osteoporosis. Although various other compounds having a
methane diphosphonate structure have been studied for use
in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and calcium
metabolism disorders, these compounds are still inadequate
in terms of their inhibitory effects on inflammation, thus
resulting in a desire for further improvement.On the other hand, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor in the
arachidonic acid cascade, an inhibitor for Interleukin-1
which is an important inflammatory cytokine, and an
inhibitor (antioxidant) for active oxygen released by
neutrophils at sites of inflammation, and so forth have
recently attracted attention as new non-steroid antiinflammatory
drug, and research has been conducted actively
on these compounds. For example, 2,4-di-isobutyl-6-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)phenol, 
i.e., a compound which
demonstrates both antioxidative action and action that
inhibits the production of Interleukin-1, is disclosed in
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63-258410;
4,4-(isopropylidenedithio)bis(2,6-di-tert-butyl)phenol,
as an inhibitor for the production of
Interleukin-1, is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 63-258408; and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxycinnamic
amide as an inhibitor for 5-lipoxygenase is
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
No. 63-130570. However, in all cases, anti-inflammatory
effects are either weak or not observed in vivo, thus
making it difficult to say that these substances have
reached a practical level.Conventional synthetic methods employed for the
hydroxymethane diphosphonates pertaining to the compounds
