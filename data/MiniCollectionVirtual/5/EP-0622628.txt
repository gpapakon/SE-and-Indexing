<ABSTRACT>
A device for determining the material humidity of a medium by determining its dielectric constant. The medium forms the dielectric of a measuring lead. A signal transmitter feeds into one end of the measuring lead a pulse-shaped signal. At the other end of the measuring lead, a receiver is connected which receives the reflected signal. The time which elapses between the beginning of feeding in the signal and the arrival of the reflected signal is measured by a device. The measuring lead is designed as a probe 1'. The body 2' has electric leads 7e, 7f in the region of its surface.
