<ABSTRACT>
A frequency multiplier of a character generating 
circuit is disclosed, wherein two frequency doublers 

which include a phase inverter (30) for inverting a 
phase by inputting a color sub-carrier signal, a 90° 

phase shifter (40) for shifting a phase by 90° by 
inputting the color sub-carrier signal, and an analog 

multiplier (50) for outputting a doubled signal that 
multiplies the output of the phase inverter by the 

output of the 90° phase shifter, are connected in 
series so as to generate a clock to create a blue 

screen, to thereby reduce product cost and noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frequency 
multiplier, and more particularly to a frequency 
multiplier to be applied to a character generating 
circuit. When a video signal cannot be input to an 
integrated circuit for character generation used in a 
television or a video tape recorder, a blue screen 
created in the integrated circuit is embodied using a 
color sub-carrier signal which is quadrupled 
externally. The color sub-carrier frequency is 
3.58MHz in the case of NTSC systems, and is 4.43MHz 
for PAL systems. In the conventional art, an externally provided 
quartz-crystal oscillator supplies an integrated 
circuit with a 4fsc signal (the color sub-carrier 
frequency signal fsc quadrupled), to create a clock in 
a character generating integrated circuit. Then, using 
an internal inverter, the character generating 
integrated circuit conditions the 4fscsignal for use 
as a clock to generate the blue screen signal. 
However, if such an external quartz-crystal oscillator 
is utilized, the system becomes overly large and noise 
increases. The object of the present invention is to provide  
 
a frequency multiplier that has a simple circuit 
construction. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a frequency multiplier which can reduce noise 
by generating a frequency multiplied signal inside an 
integrated circuit, without using a quartz-crystal 
oscillator. To accomplish one or both of the above objects, 
there is provided a frequency multiplier circuit which 
generates a clock to create a blue screen by serially 
connecting two frequency doublers both of which 
comprise:
 
   phase inverting means for receiving a color sub-carrier 
signal and inverting the phase of a signal;
 
   90° phase shifting means for receiving the above 
color sub-carrier signal and shifting the phase by 
90°; and
 
   multiplying means for exclusive OR-multiplying 
the output signals of the phase inverting means and 
90° phase shifting means and for outputting the 
multiplied signal. This is to say, the above clock 
generating circuit for the use of a blue screen is 
integrated within the character generating circuit. Other aspects and embodiments of the invention 
are as recited in the claims. The above objects and other advantages of the  
 
present invention will become more apparent by 
describing in detail a preferred embodiment thereof 
with reference to the attached drawings in which: 
FIG.1 is a block diagram of a frequency 
multiplier of the present invention; FIG.2 is a block diagram of a
