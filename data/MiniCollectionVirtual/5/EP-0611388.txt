<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent for use in absorption refrigeration systems, air conditioning systems, heat pumps or dehumidifiers comprising a solution of potassium formate. The absorbent is relatively non-toxic and relatively non-corrosive towards metals. The absorbent is generally water-based but may also comprise ammonia or methanol. Additives such as corrosion inhibitors or other absorbent salts may be included.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorption refrigeration 
and more particularly to absorbents for absorption 
refrigeration systems. The invention also relates to 
absorbents for use in heat pumps, dehumidifiers and air 
conditioning systems which operate according to the absorption 
principle. A description of the operation of a typical absorption 
refrigeration unit is given in the introduction to US-A-4311024. Absorption refrigerators and heat pumps utilise the 
latent heat of evaporation required when a solution is 
concentrated by removal of a solvent. The absorption 
refrigeration cycle uses two fluids in a totally enclosed 
system. One fluid is the refrigerant which provides the 
cooling effect, the other is the absorbent which carries the 
refrigerant through part of the cycle. The absorbent is 
commonly a solution containing the refrigerant. In operation, the refrigerant vapour is generated by 
heating the absorbent solution. This is then condensed by a 
cooling air or water stream. The vapour generator and 
condenser operate at the highest pressure in the system and 
the condensed refrigerant is expanded into a lower pressure 
region where it evaporates and absorbs heat from the 
surroundings, thereby cooling them. The refrigerant vapour 
then passes back into the contact with the absorbent, forming 
a refrigerant-rich solution which is returned to the generator 
again. Commonly, in commercial units the working fluid is a 
solution of lithium halide in water. Water is the refrigerant 
and the lithium halide solution is the absorbent. Absorption refrigeration systems find widespread use in 
large scale air-conditioning systems. In certain instances 
adequate air conditioning can be achieved by using 
concentrated absorbent solutions to provide direct air 
dehumidification. Hospital operating theatres, for instance,  
 
are major users of dehumidification plants which contact 
incoming air directly with a concentrated solution of lithium 
chloride or lithium bromide. By operating an absorption refrigerator "in reverse" it 
is possible to provide an absorption heat pump. Many different refrigerant and absorbent pairs have been 
cited in the literature, but the most important commercial 
systems are based on either: 
1. A lithium bromide-water pair, with an evaporating 
temperature >+10°C. 2. An ammonia-water pair, with an evaporating 
temperature of between +10°C and -60°C. The lithium bromide-water combination, where the lithium 
bromide acts as the absorbent, is particularly favoured e.g. 
for
