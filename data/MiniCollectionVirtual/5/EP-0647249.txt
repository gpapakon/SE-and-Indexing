<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for producing an
ionomer. The invention relates more in particular to the
producing of an ionomer from a plastic which initially usually
contains no incorporated ion compounds in addition to the
normal organic covalent bonds.This method for producing ionomers comprises
the steps of:
i) taking a plastic;ii) placing a metal ion supplying, electrically
conducting medium in contact with a surface of the
plastic;iii) applying an electrical field over the surface and
across the plastic,
this, such that electrically and chemically bonded,
ionogenic groups comprising the metal ions, supplied by
the conducting medium, occur in the plastic.It has been found, namely, that if a plastic is loaded
with an electrical field in the presence of an electrically
conducting medium, groups are radicalized or ionized from the
external and/or internal plastic surface in the direction of
the electrical field in the plastic, which groups are converted
as a result for instance of oxidation reactions into
for example carboxylic acids and/or sulphonic acids. Understood
by plastic surface is, among other things, an external
plastic surface optionally provided with grooves, scratches
or other surface defects and walls of cavities in the plastic
which may contain contaminants. Under the influence of the
electrically conducting medium these oxidized groups will
dissociate and in the presence of metal ions form the characteristic
ionogenic, functional groups, i.e. chemically bonded
salt groups. Thus formed in the generally amorphous phase of
the plastic are hydrophilic channels which are however semi-permeable.
The electrically conducting medium, for instance
water, is mobile in these channels but hydrated ions can only
displace in these channels under the influence of the electrical
field. Depending on the nature and composition of the
electrically conducting medium and the applied electrical
field an ionomer according to the invention can also be
provided with cavities in which salts are entrapped. Both liquids and gases can be used as electrically
conducting medium. The latter has the particular objective
that the oxidized groups can dissociate and form an ionogenic,
functional group with the metal ions supplied by the
medium. The electrically conducting medium can be an inorganic
medium such as water and ammonia. The electrically conducting
medium can likewise be an organic medium such as
alkanols, for instance methanol and ethanol. If the electrically
conducting medium has an inherent insufficient
