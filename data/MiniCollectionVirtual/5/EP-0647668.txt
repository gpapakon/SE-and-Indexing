<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high molecular weight aliphatic 
polyester which can be biodegraded by micro-organisms in soils and which 
can be utilized as a molded article and to a method of preparing the same. Synthetic fibers, films and other molded articles utilize plastic 
materials which are light in weight, tough, and are capable of being mass-produced 
stably at a low cost, whereby having been providing a convenient 
satisfactory life which is so-called a plastic civilization. However, recent 
concerning on global environment raises a demand for the polymeric materials 
which can be degraded in environment. Among such materials, plastic 
materials capable of being degraded by microorganisms are especially 
attractive and expected to be used as environment-conscious materials as well 
as novel functional materials. It is well known that aliphatic polyesters are biodegradable. 
Representatives of such polyesters are poly-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) which 
is produced by micro-organisms and poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and 
polyglycolic acid (PGA) which are synthetic polymers. Although the polyesters mainly consisting of PHB have excellent 
compatibility with the environment as well as physical properties and are 
produced in an industrial scale, their producibility is poor and they are of only 
limited use in view of the cost when used as the substitutes of widely-employed 
plastics such as polyethylene (See "Fibers and industry", Vol.47, page 532 
(1991)). On the other hand, PCL provides highly polymerized materials 
capable of being formed into fibers or films, but has poor heat resistance due to  
 
its melting point as low as 65 °C or lower, resulting in impossibility of being 
applied widely (See "Polym. Sci. Technol.", Vol.3, page 61 (1973)). PGA and 
glycolide-lactide (9:1) copolymer which are used practically in biocompatible 
sutures are non-biologically hydrolyzed and then metabolized and absorbed in 
vivo, but are expensive and have poor water resistance, thus being not suitable 
to be employed widely. Aliphatic polyesters obtained by melt condensation polymerization 
of α, ω-aliphatic diols and α, ω-aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as 
polyethylene succinate (PES), polyethylene adipate (PEA) and polybutylene 
succinate (PBS), are well known, which can be produced at a low cost and are 
proven in in-soil tests to be capable of being biodegraded by microorganisms 
(See "Int. Biodetetn. Bull.", Vol.11, page 127 (1975) and "Polym. Sci. Technol.", 
Vol.3, page 61 (1973)). However, these
