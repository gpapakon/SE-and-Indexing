<ABSTRACT>
Ceiling luminaires, in particular built-in ceiling luminaires often have to be accessible from below and therefore have a corresponding constructive structure of the luminaire housing. The light source which can be inserted in a main reflector of the luminaire is in this case usually arranged at a socket holder which is mounted on the luminaire housing. In high-quality ceiling luminaires, specific photometric requirements must be met which in particular assume that the focal spot of the light source is arranged at a photometrically specified point with reference to the main-beam axis of the luminaire. In known ceiling luminaires, tolerances in terms of material and production result in this focal spot being repositioned.   To compensate for tolerances of luminaire dimensions, the vertex plane of the main reflector (3) of the luminaire is selected as reference plane. The light source (5), together with its socket (10) and the socket holder (9, 11) is constructed as a unit with narrow tolerances, which is supported directly, preferably movable along the main-beam axis, on the main reflector in this reference plane. This solution can be advantageously used in particular in high-quality ceiling luminaires, in which light-shaping elements, such as diffusing screens, filters and the like, and whose thickness dimensions frequently have large tolerances due to production, are arranged in the light exit opening.

<CLAIMS>
Ceiling luminaire having a luminaire housing (2), 
a main reflector (3) arranged in the luminaire housing, 

a socket mounting (9, 11) to accommodate a socket (10) of 
a light source (5) which is arranged, in relation to the 

main reflector, with its focal spot at a predetermined 
location on the luminaire main beam axis, the socket 

mounting, the socket and the light source forming one 
unit which is supported directly in the vertex plane with 

axial pre-tension, characterized in that the main reflector 
(3) is arranged fixed in the luminaire housing (2), 

the socket mounting (9, 11), by contrast, is mounted 
independently thereof in the luminaire housing so as to 

be displaceable along the luminaire main beam axis, and 
hence the closely toleranced unit formed by the socket 

mounting, socket (10) and light source (5) is arranged so 
as to be axially movable in relation to the main reflector 

and is supported with its dead weight in the vertex 
plane of the main reflector, this vertex plane being 

selected as a reference plane for compensating tolerances 
of luminaire dimensions. 
Ceiling luminaire according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the socket mounting (9, 11) has a fastening 

angle (9) which is bent over twice in a U-shape, 
between the limbs of which the socket (10) for the light 

source (5) is arranged and which is supported with its 
limbs on the vertex of the main reflector (3), and in 

that the socket mounting furthermore has attachments 
(110) which point parallel to the luminaire main beam 

axis and face away from the fastening angle and are 
guided in cutouts (210) which are provided in a top  

 
surface (21) of the luminaire housing (2) which lies at 

right angles to the luminaire main beam axis. 
Ceiling luminaire according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that, between the socket mounting (9, 11) and 

the top surface (21) of the luminaire housing (2), 
provision is made for a spring element (14) which pretensions 

the socket mounting in the direction of the main 
reflector (3). 
Ceiling luminaire according to either of Claims 
2 and 3, characterized in that the socket mounting (9, 

11) has a centring element (111) which is arranged 
coaxially with respect to the luminaire main beam axis 

and is supported so as to be vertically displaceable in 

the top surface (21) of the luminaire housing (2). 
Ceiling luminaire according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, in which, in the light exit opening formed by the 

outer edge of the main reflector (3), there is arranged 
an essentially planar light-shaping covering element (6), 

characterized in that an insert (8) which can be pushed 
from below onto the luminaire housing (2) is provided as 

a receptacle for the covering element (6) and is designed 
in such a way that this covering element, supported 

directly on the outer edge of the main reflector (3), is 
fixed in a defined way in the light exit opening.
