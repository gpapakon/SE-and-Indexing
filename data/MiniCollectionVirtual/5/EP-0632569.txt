<ABSTRACT>
Circuit arrangement for converting a DC voltage into a partial voltage, which can be tapped on a buffer capacitor (8), a first pole (11) of the voltage source (1) being connected, via a circuit containing capacitors (41 to 45) and diodes (51 to 54, 61 to 64, 71 to 74), to a first pole (81) of the buffer capacitor (8), and the second pole (12) of the voltage source (1) being connected to the second pole (82) of the buffer capacitor (8). In this case, the first pole (11) of the voltage source (1) is connected to the input of a first switch (31), to the output of which switch there is connected the series circuit of at least one capacitor (41 to 44) and in each case a first diode (51 to 54), the last diode (54) of the series circuit being connected to the first pole (81) of the buffer capacitor (8), one pole of the at least one capacitor (41 to 44) being connected, via in each case one second diode (61 to 64), to the input of a second switch (32), the output of which switch is likewise connected to the first pole (81) of the buffer capacitor (8), and, furthermore, the second pole (12) of the voltage source (1) is connected, via in each case one third diode (71 to 74), to the other pole of the at least one capacitor (41 to 45).
