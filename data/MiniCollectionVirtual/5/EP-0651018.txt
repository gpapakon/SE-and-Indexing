<ABSTRACT>
Polymeric compositions basically consisting of polyamides 
(nylon) and acrylic rubber, are characterized by 

their high shock-resistance and modulus, together with 
high thermal characteristics. They are used in the 

production of moulded products, which can be used in 
fields which require high thermal characteristics and 

high modulus and at the same time a good surface 
appearance and excellent anti-shock properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric compositions,
basically consisting of polyamides (nylon) and
acrylic rubber, characterized by their high shock-resistance
and modulus, together with high thermal
characteristics.The present invention also relates to the use of
these compositions for the manufacturing of products
having a high shock-resistance, excellent surface
appearance and good processability (mouldability) and
which can be used in fields in which high thermal
characteristics and high modulus are an essential
characteristic.It is known that polyamides (nylon) in general and
polycaprolactam (polyamide-6 or nylon-6) in particular
have a low shock-resistance immediately after moulding,
whereas this property is reacquired with time following
the progessive absorption of water. This characteristic 
of absorbing water, on the one hand, can be considered
positive in that, as already mentioned, it raises the
shock-resistance values, whereas on the other hand it
can prevent the immediate use of the moulded items
without further treatment (forced absorption of water,
also called conditioning process). Water absorption is
also a characteristic of all polyamides which eventually
causes a lowering of the stiffness values.Numerous methods have been proposed in the art for
overcoming the above drawbacks. Among these particular
importance has been given to the use of various rubbers
as they are able to provide much higher shock-resistant
characteristics in all operating conditions and even at
low temperatures.In these compositions however, besides an immediate
improvement in the shock-resistant properties,
there was a lowering of the thermal characteristics,
for example Vicat (Vicat refers to the Temperature at
which a pinpoint with a diameter of 1 mm penetrates for
a depth of 1 mm into the material being tested when
subjected to a constant load; ASTM D 1525) and modulus,
together with a deterioration of the surface appearance;
deterioration probably caused by the presence of
high quantities of rubber phase and by the appearance
of phase separation phenomena. A first answer was found in the use of a low
density polyethylene (LLDPE) grafted with maleic
anhydride (see for example patent application EP 0 157
984). The result, extended to olefinic rubbers of the
series ethylene-propylene, suitably grafted with maleic
anhydride, had the consequence of taking into consideration
the use of compositions based on polyamides
(nylon) grafted with ethylene-propylene polymers; in
these polymers, the lack of phase
