<ABSTRACT>
In an AV system constituted of a plurality of AV devices, a ROM (5A) stores a plurality of preset connections 
of the AV devices in order to reduce its capacity required. In addition, an SIP (system information pointer) memory 

(6) temporarily stores an SIP which designates one of the connections stored in the ROM (5A). The SIP is finally 
stored in a nonvolatile memory (7) so that it is retained even after the power supply to the AV system is turned off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an AV (audio/video)
system composed of a plurality of AV component devices
and a method of establishing a connection setting for the AV
component devices.AV systems are composed of a plurality of AV component
devices including a TV (television) set, a VTR (video
tape recorder), an LDP (laser disc player), etc. which are
connected in a certain configuration.Since such AV systems allow their component devices
to be connected in all possible configurations, it is necessary
for a ROM to have a large storage capacity for storing
system configuration information, and'the user finds it difficult
to establish a connection setting for the component
devices of the system.In the conventional AV systems, the system configuration
representing a connecting setting for a plurality of
AV component devices is stored as it is in a nonvolatile memory
(NVRAM). Since the nonvolatile memory is expensive, the
storage capacity thereof needs to be as small as possible.In view of the above conventional problems, it is a 
first object of the present invention to provide an AV system
having a nonvolatile memory of as small a storage capacity as
possible for storing system configuration information.A second object of the present invention is to provide
an AV system which allows the storage capacity of a ROM
for storing system configuration information in advance to be
as small as possible.A third object of the present invention is to provide
a method of simply establishing a connection setting for
AV component devices.According to the present invention, there is
provided an AV system comprising a plurality of AV
component devices, including an AV center;
   said AV center comprising:
configuration storage means for storing a
predetermined system configuration of the AV component
devices; anda non volatile memory for storing at least pointer
information of the predetermined system configuration
stored in said configuration storage means.This arrangement allows a given system configuration
of the AV component devices to be stored well.Preferably, the non volatile memory stores
difference information indicative of the difference
between the system configuration stored in said 
configuration storage means and a given system
configuration.This arrangement allows given system configurations
of the AV component devices to be stored, and any one of
the system configuration is indicated by a pointer,
reducing the storage capacity for storing the system
configurations.Preferably, the configuration storage
