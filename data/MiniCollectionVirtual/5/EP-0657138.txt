<ABSTRACT>
A multi-position ratchet mechanism for holding a surgical 
retractor blade (18) which permits a retractor blade to be 

rotated into the wound and retracted at the same time to 
duplicate the natural "toe-in" method of retraction 

achieved with the hand. The ratchet mechanism includes a 
ratchet holder (30) to which is pivotally attached a ratchet 

pivot housing (32). The retractor blade is mounted in an 
opening (42) projecting through ratchet pivot housing and held 

in position by a retractor pawl (44) attached to the ratchet 
pivot housing. The ratchet pivot housing also has a 

curved ratchet (68) which depends into a cooperating slot (70) in 
the ratchet holder and engages a ratchet release bar (80) which 

is mounted on the ratchet holder and spring biased into 
the ratchet slot. One end of ratchet release bar is 

positioned under an actuating surface (52) of the retractor 
pawl. The application of pressure on the actuating 

surface will release both ratchets to allow adjustment of 
the retractor blade.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-position ratchet
mechanism for holding a surgical retractor blade and, more
particularly, to a quick-release ratchet mechanism which
permits the retractor blade to be tilted into the wound
and retracted at the same time. A single thumb piece can
be manipulated to permit simultaneous in and out motion of
the retractor blade and tilting of the retractor blade.In surgical operations of the chest or abdomen, it is
customary to employ a retraction apparatus to retain
tissue away from the operative site. Such a retractor
system is shown in U.S. Patent 4,254,763, and in U.S.
Patent 4,424,724. The retractor shown in U.S. Patent
4,424,724, upon which the preamble of claim 1 is
based, is a multi-position ratchet mechanism which
permits a retractor blade to be rotated into the wound and
retracted at the same time to duplicate the natural toe-in
method of retraction achieved if the retractor was held by
hand. These ratchet mechanism are employed in a surgical
retractor assembly which includes a support post which
attaches directly to the surgical operating table. An
extension arm may be attached to the support post for
supporting an oval or round or other shape ring above the
surgical incision. One or more retractor blades can be
attached to the ring by means of the retractor ratchet
mechanisms. Retractor blades of different sizes and
shapes may be used to obtain the desired positioning and
retraction of internal organs and tissue so that the
operative site may be completely exposed for the surgeon.
In the retractor system shown in the U.S. patent 
4,424,724, the retractor can be rotated by tilting the
blade into the wound so that organs can be retracted and
lifted at the same time. It is particularly advantageous
to be able to retract toward the ring to obtain exposure
under an organ, such as lifting on the thoracic cage to
reach a hiatal hernia. By rotating the blade down into
the wound, and then lifting and retracting at the same
time, one duplicates the natural "toe-in" method of
retraction that would be achieved by the hand. This type
of retraction enables the surgeon to see the underlying
organs better than if the retractor can only move away
from the operative site without lifting. The ability to
lift the retractor blade also enables a single retractor
blade to be used at different depth rather than to use
different retractor blades for different depths in the
body.The retractor ratchet system shown in U.S. Patent
4,424,724 employs two ratchet mechanism to allow the
ti

<CLAIMS>
A multi-position ratchet mechanism comprising:

a generally rectangular ratchet holder (30) having top,
bottom, front, rear, left and right surfaces, a ratchet

pivot housing (32) pivotally mounted on said ratchet
holder;
a bore (42) extending through said ratchet pivot housing
to receive a retractor blade stem (22); said retractor blade

stem having a ratchet (24) on a surface of said stem;
a first pawl (44) pivotally affixed to said ratchet
housing and having a pawl blade (46) at one end to engage

the ratchet (24) on said retractor blade stem (22), and an
actuating surface (52) at a second end to pivot the pawl

blade out of engagement with said retractor blade stem
ratchet when force is applied to said actuating surface;
means (64) attached to said ratchet pivot housing (32)
for biasing said first pawl (44) into engagement with said

ratchet (24);
a slot (70) on said ratchet holder (30) extending from
its rear surface toward its front surface and extending from

said top to said bottom surface;
a curved pivot ratchet (68) integral with and depending
from said ratchet pivot housing (32) into said slot (70) of

said ratchet holder (30) and;
a second paw] (88) having a surface positioned to engage

said curved ratchet (68);
characterised in that said second pawl (88) comprises
a ratchet release bar (80) pivotally affixed on the top

surface of said ratchet holder (30) and extending over said
slot (70) on said ratchet holder;
said ratchet release bar (80) having a first surface
comprising said surface engaging said curved ratchet (68),

and second surface extending along the ratchet housing and
underlying the actuating surface of said first pawl (44),

whereby the movement of said actuating surface will release
the pawl blade (46) engaging the ratchet (24) on the

retractor blade stem (22) and the ratchet release bar (80) 
engaging the curved ratchet (68).
The ratchet mechanism of claim 1 including means (90)
to bias the ratchet release bar (80) into engagement with

said curved ratchet (68).
The ratchet mechanism of claim 1 in which one end of the
ratchet release bar (80) extends beyond the end of the

actuating surface (52) of said pawl blade (46).
