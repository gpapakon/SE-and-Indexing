<ABSTRACT>
A precordial system and method having a strip assembly (321) for use on a patient having skin, right and left arms and legs and a heart with a precordium lying thereover comprising an elongate strip (321) having first and second surfaces. Six conductive contact elements identified as V1 through V6 are mounted in space apart positions along the length of the strip (321). The strip (321) is connected to an amplifier (381) which is connected to an encoder modulator (382) which is connected to a transmitter (383) for frequency transmission of signals to receiver (388). Decoded signals are filtered by filter (396) and output to ECG printer (397) or monitor (398) or Holter recorder (399).

<DESCRIPTION>
 WIRELESS ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM AND WIRELESS ELECTRO ASSEMBLIESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to medical instrumentation and to a system for the use thereof, as well as to a system and method of monitoring certain physiological parameters, and for the detection and transmission of these without the use of wires to suitable display and/or recording monitoring equipment. This invention is described in detail with reference to electrocardiographic and cardiocirculatory monitoring equipment and method and system relating thereto. According to this invention, other or further physiological data of a patient can be measured and if desired, wirelessly transmitted to suitable equipment for detection, monitoring and evaluation.In my previous US Patent No. 4,981,141 there is described and claimed, amongst others a wireless electrocardiographic monitoring system for displaying detected heart-signals, said system including:right arm, left arm, right leg and left leg electrodes for attachment to the indicated limbs of a patient; right arm heart-signal transmitting means electrically couplable to said right arm electrode for radiating a signal corresponding to the heart-signal at said right arm electrode; left arm heart-signal transmitting means electrically couplable to said left arm electrode for radiating a signal corresponding to the heart-signal to said left arm electrode; left leg heart-signal transmitting means electrically couplable for radiating a signal corresponding to the heart-signal at said left leg electrode; 

a plurality of signal receiving means, one each for receiving and detecting said radiated heart-signals from said left arm, right arm and left leg electrodes, respectively, to individually produce a received left arm heart-signal, a received right arm heart-signal and a received left leg heart-signal. means for combining said individually received left arm, right arm and left leg heart-signals to produce a reference potential; reference potential transmitting means coupled to said combining means for transmitting said reference potential; right leg signal receiving means electrically couplable to said right leg electrode for receiving said reference potential and applying said reference potential to said right leg electrode; a set of precordial electrodes for attachment to the chest of a patient; a set of precordial heart-signal transmitting means each one electrically couplable to different ones of said precordial electrodes in said set for individually radiating signals
