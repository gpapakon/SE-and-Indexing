<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gastroplasty ring consisting of a flexible strip (1) that is closed towards its two ends (5, 5') with a closing system (10, 10b, 11, 12, 12', 13), around the stomach. Said strip comprises an annular compression chamber (2) which is connected by a regulating catheter (4) to a device (6) for regulating the internal pressure of the chamber. The invention is characterized in that the closing system (10, 10b, 11, 12, 12', 13) comprises reversible ring blocking and loosening means (10, 10b, 12, 12', 13), comprising a male element (11) and a female element (10, 10b), said female element forming a cavity into or against which the male element reversibly expands and is blocked. The invention is suitable for a gastric implant for treating obesity.

Gastroplasty ring formed by a flexible band (1) intended to be closed towards its two ends (5, 5') by a closure system (10, 10b, 11, 12, 12', 13) around the stomach in order to reduce the diameter of the stoma, the said band comprising an annular compression chamber (2) with an adjustable volume and a substantially constant cross-section connected by an adjustment catheter (4) to a device (6) for adjusting the internal pressure of the said chamber, in order to adjust its diametral expansion, 
characterised in that
 the closure system (10, 10b, 11, 12, 12', 13) comprises reversible means (10, 10b, 11, 12, 12', 13) of locking and releasing the ring, comprising a male means (11) and a female means (10, 10b) forming a cavity in or against which the male means (11) is expanded and locked in a reversible manner, making it possible to ensure, from its diametral locking position, its momentary diametral release by relative movement of the two ends (5, 5') whilst constantly forming a closed loop around the stomach.
Ring according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the locking and releasing means involve fluid means, such as air or a liquid.
Ring according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
, in the closure system (10-13):

- the male means (11) and the female means (10) are fixed to the band (1) and mounted on it while extending it at its two ends (5, 5') so that, when they are mutually connected, the band (1) is closed, forming a loop,
- the reversible locking and release means (12, 12', 13) are mounted on the male means (11) and able to slide in the female means (10) between a locking position and a release position.
Ring according to claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that
 the female means is formed by an eyelet (10, 10b), the male means is formed by an inflatable catheter (11) intended to be slipped into the eyelet (10, 10b), the reversible
 locking and release means being connected to the catheter (11) and comprising at least one deformable zone (12, 12') able firstly to form locally a protrusion (13) in the event of increase in pressure in the catheter, the said protrusion bearing in or against the eyelet (10) in order to lock the ring in the closed position, and secondly to resume its idle shape in the event of return to normal pressure, to allow the free sliding of the inflatable catheter (11) in the eyelet (10, 10b) and the release of the loop.
Ring according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the deformable zone (12, 12') is a zone of less strength formed on the inflation catheter (11).
Ring according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the deformable zone (12, 12') is formed by a pouch (12a) extending the end (5') of the flexible band (1) and to which the inflation catheter (11) is connected.
Ring according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that
 the inflatable catheter (11) comprises two zones (12, 12') of less strength, spaced along the said catheter.
Ring according to claim 4, 5 or 7, 
characterised in that
 the flexible band (1) is provided at one end (5') with a hollow sleeve (15) to which one end (16) of the inflatable catheter (11) is fixed, the said sleeve comprising an opening (17) so that the other end (5) of the band (1) can be inserted in the sleeve (15), the adjustment catheter (4) passing through the opening (17) in order to form the loop of the ring.
Ring according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the eyelet 10) is disposed at a distance from one end (15) of the band (1) in order to create a free portion of the chamber (2) intended to be inserted in the hollow sleeve.
Ring according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the flexible band (1), the compression chamber (2) and the female means (10, 10b) form a single piece produced from the same plastics material.
Ring according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the compression chamber (2) extends over the whole of the periphery of the ring.
Ring according to one of claims 4 to 11, 
characterised in that
 the inflatable catheter (11) is connected to a compressing/decompressing device.
