<ABSTRACT>
Physiological monitoring of a baby is carried out from a fabric patch (2) that is attached by fibre hook-and-eye fastening to the baby's conventional, stretchable vest (1). The laminated patch (2), which bridges the baby's thoracic and abdominal regions, includes a concealed substrate (4) that carries piezo-electric film strips (10, 11) which sense, in those regions respectively, elastic deflections of the vest (1) caused by the baby's respiratory and heart functions. Signals from the strips (10, 11), together with a body-temperature signal from a thermistor (17, Figure 4), are processed and transmitted via an inductive-loop antenna (19) of the patch (2), to a remote unit (21, Figure 5) for further, more detailed processing to derive representation inter alia of thoracic-abdominal synchrony/asynchrony. The result is stored and monitored against stored clinical-data for display and alarm operation; the stored data is accessed by a data logger (31, Figure 5) for detailed analysis. Patch-attachment can be under a flap (43, Figure 6) bridging an opening (44) in the vest (41), or may be internally, rather than externally, of the vest.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Health MonitoringThe present invention relates to health monitoring, and is especially concerned with monitoring one or more vital signs of a human or animal subject.Facilities for monitoring vital signs (embracing respiration, pulse, body temperature and blood pressure) of a subject are readily available in the context of a hospital or clinic. Whereas such facilities can, as a general matter, also be used and adapted for monitoring a subject out of that context, for example in the home environment, the equipment involved is normally not only expensive, but also obtrusive, cumbersome and inconvenient to an extent that its use is unacceptable or creates an undesirable intrusion into everyday life.It is one of the objects of the present invention to facilitate the monitoring of vital signs in a less obtrusive, cumbersome and inconvenient manner than with known equipment.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for monitoring vital signs of a human or animal subject, wherein the subject wears a vest in the form of a garment that has stretch both laterally and longitudinally of the subject's body to fit the body closely, elastic deflections of the vest related to respiratory and/or heart functions of the subject are sensed in both the thoracic and abdominal regions of the subject by sensors that are carried by a common carrier attached to the vest, and signals dependent on the sensed deflections are transmitted for reception and analysis remotely of the subject.According to another aspect of the invention a system for monitoring vital signs of a human or animal subject, 

 comprises a vest for wear by the subject in the form of a garment that has stretch both laterally and longitudinally of the subject's body to fit the body closely, sensors that are carried by a common carrier attached to the vest for sensing in both the thoracic and abdominal regions of the subject elastic deflections of the vest related to the subject's respiratory and/or heart functions, and means for transmitting signals dependent on the sensed deflections for reception and analysis remotely of the subject.The method and system of the invention are of especial advantage where monitoring is to be carried out in circumstances, which may occur in the environment of a hospital or clinic, but may be more significant in the home environment, where the presence and use of conventional health monitoring equipment is likely to cause distraction and anxiety for the subject concerned, and, possibly also, for

Claims :
1. A method for monitoring vital signs of a human or animal subject, wherein the subject wears a vest in the form of a garment that has stretch both laterally and longitudinally of the subject's body to fit the body closely, elastic deflections of the vest related to respiratory and/or heart functions of the subject are sensed in both the thoracic and abdominal regions of the subject by sensors that are carried by a common carrier attached to the vest, and signals dependent on the sensed deflections are transmitted for reception and analysis remotely of the subject.
2. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the sensors comprise piezo-electric sensors that are located on the common carrier to lie respectively within the thoracic and abdominal regions of the subject.
3. A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the subject's body temperature is sensed by sensing means carried by the common carrier, and the transmitted signals include a signal dependent on the sensed temperature.
4. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the signal transmission is by electromagnetic- wave transmission from the common carrier.
5. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the transmitted signals received remotely are processed to provide representation dependent on thoracic-abdominal motion synchrony/asynchrony.
6. A method according to any one Claims 1 to 5 used for apnoea-monitoring of a baby. 


 7. A system for monitoring vital signs of a human or animal subject, comprising a vest for wear by the subject in the form of a garment that has stretch both laterally and longitudinally of the subject's body to fit the body closely, sensors that are carried by a common carrier attached to the vest, for sensing in both the thoracic and abdominal regions of the subject elastic deflections of the vest related to the subject's respiratory and/or heart functions, and means for transmitting signals dependent on the sensed deflections for reception and analysis remotely of the subject.
8. A system according to Claim 7 wherein the sensors comprise two piezo-electric sensors that are located on the common carrier for responding to the elastic deflections of the vest in the thoracic and abdominal regions respectively.
9. A system according to Claim 7 or Claim 8 including temperature-sensing means carried by the common carrier for responding to the subject's body temperature, and wherein the signals transmitted by the transmitting means include a signal dependent on the response of the temperature-sensing means.
10. A system according to any one of Claims 7 to 9 wherein the common carrier is attached to the vest to bridge the subject's thoracic and abdominal regions.
11. A system according to any one of Claims 7 to 10 wherein the common carrier is a patch that is removably attached to the vest.
12. A system according to Claim 11 wherein the patch is attached to the vest by a fabric fastening involving the inter-engagement of hook fibres with fibres of the vest. 


13. A system according to Claim 11 wherein the patch is attached to the vest under a flap or within a pocket of the vest.
14. A system according to any one of Claims 11 to 13 wherein the patch is of laminate form having a fabric top layer.
15. A system according to any one of Claims 7 to 14 wherein the transmission means is means for electromagnetic-wave transmission of the signals dependent on the sensed deflections.
16. A system according to Claim 15 wherein the transmission means is carried by the common carrier.
