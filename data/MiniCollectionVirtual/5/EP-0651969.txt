<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blood pressure
monitor system which continuously measures intra-arterial
blood pressure of a living subject and particularly relates
to the art of improving the accuracy of blood pressure
measurement.There has been proposed a blood pressure monitor
system including a pressure sensor having a press surface
and including one or more pressure sensing elements provided
in the press surface; a pressing device which presses the
pressure sensor against an arterial vessel of a living
subject such as a patient via a body surface of the subject
so that each pressure sensing element of the pressure sensor
measures pressures at the body surface of the subject;
pressing-force determining means for determining an optimum
pressing force of the pressing device at which a portion of
a wall of the artery is flattened under the pressure sensor
pressed by the pressing device; and blood-pressure
determining means for operating the pressing device to
maintain the determined optimum pressing force and press the
pressure sensor against the artery via the body surface or
skin, and continuously determining intra-arterial blood 
pressure values of the artery, based on the pressure
magnitudes or values measured by the pressure sensor at the
body surface. An example of this monitor system is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 5,119,822 or U.S. Patent No. 5,179,956.In the above-indicated prior monitor system, the
pressure sensor is pressed against the artery via the body
surface or skin, such that the wall of the artery is partly
flattened under the pressure sensor. Since the pressure
values measured by the pressure sensor through the flattened
wall of the artery are free from adverse influences of the
tensile forces produced in the arterial wall, they well
reflect intra-arterial blood pressure values of the artery.
According to this blood pressure measurement principle, the
prior monitor system continuously measures the blood
pressure of the subject by using the pressure sensor pressed
at the optimum pressing force.Meanwhile, the experiments the present inventors
conducted have elucidated that the blood pressure values
continuously measured by the above-indicated prior monitor
system tend to be higher than the blood pressure values
measured using an inflatable cuff, and do not enjoy
sufficiently high measurement accuracy. In this background,
the present inventors have made various studies and
experiments, and found that the soft and elastic
subcutaneous tissue exists between the arterial vessel and
the
