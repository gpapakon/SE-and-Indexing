 Description.A Multi-function Tool for the Cleaning of Surfaces,Technical Field.The invention relates to a multi-function tool for the cleaning of surfaces.Background Art.The prior art teaches very varied structural types of tools used for the cleaning of rooms or surfaces in general, such as for example brooms, brushes, sponges etc.: those of a traditional type are essentially constituted by a support of the cleaning body to which a handle is associated.This handle can be associated to the support in a fixed position, hinged to the said support in such a way as to adapt to the movements of the user, or it can be screwable at one end into a corresponding seating realised on the surface of the support; in this last case the two elements can be put into separate wrappings, where the handle is of a universal type, while in the two preceding cases the handle is commercialised only in a single wrapping, that is, in a kit-form, with the rest of the tool.These solutions however present some drawbacks of practical and economic natures: the first kind of drawback regards the use of the tools, due to the fact that if the 

 tool is of the separate-element kind it is necessary for the user to make continuous substitutions of the cleaning body in accordance with the kind of cleaning operation to be performed (brushing or wahing of surfaces, glass cleaning etc.); the poor economy of such solutions is due to the fact that in practice, especially in the household context, the user is obliged to equip the various supports bearing relative cleaning bodies with corresponding handles, especially if the support bodies exhibit different fixing systems (joint-type or screw-type for example).A further drawback is due to the considerable mass created by all of the elements which obviously is more greatly felt in the small cupboards, such as those in recently- built housing, which are dedicated to the housing of such tools.The aim of the present invention is there ore to eliminate the abov-mentioned drawbacks by providing a multi-function tool for cleaning and treatment of various surfaces, which tool envisages a single variously-positionable handle and a single cleaning surface support adaptable to several types of cleaning surfaces, thus to be defined a practical, functional and economical tool.Disclosure of the Invention.The technical characteristics of the invention, according to the above-mentioned aims, are clearly represented in the following claims and the advantages of 

the invention will better emerge from the
