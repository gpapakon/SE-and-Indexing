<CLAIMS>
A thin-walled hollow object manufactured from a precious metal or from a precious
metal alloy using the electro-forming method, for use as an ornament or

as jewellery 
characterised in,
 that there is provided a core (6) of an injectable
thermoplastic plastic material for permanently supporting the thin

outer wall (1, 2), in which core is inserted a functional element (3, 5, 7).
A hollow object according to claim 1, 
characterised in,
 that the core (6) comprises
a metallic functional element (3, 5, 7) which is directly joined to the

outer wall (1, 2) and consist of the same material as the outer wall.
A method of manufacturing a hollow object according to claim 1 by

injection molding the core in a negative mold of the hollow object
metallizing the core,
strengthening the metalization by electrolytic metal deposition,
characterised in,
 that the core is formed from a thermoplastic plastic material
and that a functional element of the ornament or of the jewellery is inserted

into the core.
Method according to claim 3, 
characterised in,
 that the functional element is
embedded into the core during the injection molding thereof. 
Method according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in
, that the strengthening of
the metallization is terminated when a thickness thereof of 75 µm at most,

preferably 40 to 60 µm at most, is reached.
Method according to claim 5, 
characterised in,
 that the functional element (3,
5, 7) consists of the same material as the outer wall of the hollow object and is

so embedded that it protrudes at least at one location from the core material.
