pulse signal generating means (25) for detecting a 
change in address input and generating a pulse signal; 

and data detecting means (21) for detecting data stored

connected to the pulse signal generating means (25) and 
controlled by said pulse signal from said pulse signal

detect a width of said pulse signal generated by said 

pulse signal generating means (25), and generate a 
pulse signal when the width of said pulse signal 

outputted from said pulse signal generating means (25) 
is greater than a predetermined value. Data latching 

means (22; 27) latch the data detected by said data

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit (IC) and, more particularly, to a 
semiconductor memory having an output buffer circuit 
through which a large current flows. This is a demand for higher processing speed of a 
semiconductor integrated circuit. For example, in a 
semiconductor memory, a fast access time and a decrease 
in power consumption become important subjects. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional 
random access memory (RAM) in which an operation of an 
internal circuit is controlled by a pulse signals this 
pulse signal is generated in synchronism with a change 
of an address input signal. A fast access time and a 
decrease in power consumption are attempted by using the 
pulse signal. In this case, in order to simplify a 
description, a circuit portion associated with data 
writing is omitted. Referring to Fig. 1, reference 
numerals 11 denote a plurality of address input 
terminals; 12, a column address buffer; 13, a row 
address buffer; 14, a column decoder; 15, a row decoder; 
16, column selection lines; 17, row lines: 18, a memory 
cell array having a plurality of memory cells (not 
shown) in a matrix form to be selected by signals 
through row lines 17; 19, bit lines; 20, a column gate 
circuit; 21, a sense amplifier; 23, an output buffer 
circuit; 24, a data output terminal; and 25, a pulse  
 
signal generator. Column and row address buffers 12 and 13 respectively 
generate internal address signals corresponding 
to column and row address input signals externally 
supplied from circuits outside the memory. Pulse signal 
generator 25 receives the internal address signals 
output from column and row address buffers 12 and 13, 
and outputs a pulse signal when the logic level of at 
least one of the address signals is changed. The pulse 
signal output from pulse signal generator 25 is supplied 
to memory cell array 18, sense amplifier 21, and output 
buffer circuit 23. Operation of memory cell array 18, 
sense amplifier 21, and output buffer circuit 23 are 
controlled by this pulse signal. For example, a 
precharge operation of each bit line in memory cell 
array 18, a sensing operation of data in sense amplifier 
21, and an output operation of data in output buffer 
circuit 23 are respectively controlled by this pulse 
signal. The above pulse signal is set to have a pulse 
width enough to allow memory cell array 18, sense 
amplifier 21, and output buffer circuit 23 to be 
operated with a sufficient margin. In a semiconductor memory, a large
