<ABSTRACT>
Modulators of NET-4 are provided that reduce the expression or biological activities of NET-4 or the expression of NET?4 mRNA in a mammalian cell. NET-4 modulators include antisense molecules, ribozymes, antibodies and antibody fragments, proteins and polypeptides as well as small molecules. NET-4 modulators find use in compositions and methods for decreasing NET-4 gene expression as well as methods for inhibiting the proliferation of mammalian cells, including tumor cells, and methods for treating neoplastic diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING NEOPLASTIC DISEASE USING NET-4 MODULATORSTECHNICAL FIELD The invention provides compositions and methods for inhibiting NET-4 gene expression and/or biological activity. Such compositions and methods find utility in the treatment of neoplastic disease.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNET-4 is a member of the tetraspan transmembrane receptor family. There have been no published reports disclosing the function of the molecule. The tetraspan family is discussed in Maecker, H.T. et al., FASEB J. --7:428-442, 1997.Expression of tetraspan genes in lymphoma cell lines is discussed in Ferrer, M. et al.,Clin. Exp. Immunol. 113:346-352, 1998.Thus, there is a need in the art for correlation between this protein family and essential or pathological processes. The present invention helps to fulfill this need by disclosing the use of NET-4 antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides, in one embodiment, inhibitors of NET-4. Inventive inhibitors include, but are not limited to, antisense molecules, ribozymes, antibodies or antibody fragments, proteins or polypeptides as well as small molecules. Exemplary antisense molecules comprise at least 10, 15 or 20 consecutive nucleotides of or hybridize under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:l. More preferred are antisense molecules that comprise at least 15, 20 or 25 consecutive nucleotides of or hybridize under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. Representative antisense molecules are provided herein as SEQ ID NO:2-6. 

 In farther embodiments, compositions are provided that comprise one or more NET-4 inhibitor in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Additional embodiments provide methods of decreasing NET-4 gene expression or biological activity. Each of the methods of the present invention has in common the administration of one or more inventive NET-4 inhibitor to a mammalian cell.The invention further provides a kit for detecting a colon tumor cell, comprising at least one oligonucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFigure 1 illustrates the schematic structure of tetraspan proteins. Amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini and extracellular and transmembrane domains are indicated in boldface. Highly conserved amino acids found in 12 of 18 tetraspan genes, are shown in circles. Highly conserved amino acids found in 14 or more tetraspans are shown in boldface
