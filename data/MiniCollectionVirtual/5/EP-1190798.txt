<ABSTRACT>
The positioning drive has a gearbox (18) that can move relative to the housing (12) to adjust the cutter (76) or tool holder, driven by a motor (24) via a power supply (26). Within the housing is a hollow shaft (50) coupled to the gearbox. The shaft rotates but cannot slide and the gearbox slides relative to it. The motor is actually in two sections around the periphery of the shaft, driving it with gears (62,70). The hollow shaft has an inner thread engaging an outer thread on the gearbox. The electric motors use numerical control and are either stepping motors or servomotors.

Tool head for use in machine tools comprising a basic
body (12), a tool shank (16) projecting axially beyond

the basic body (12) and connectable to a rotating
machine spindle (14), a thrust element (18)

displaceable relative to the basic body (12) for
adjusting at least one cutting-edge carrier or cutting

tool (76), an electric motor arrangement (24) disposed
in the basic body (12) and connectable to the thrust

element (18), and a power supply device (26) for the

motor arrangement (24), 
characterized by
 an
interchangeable cutting head (84), which is disposed on

the front of the basic body (12) and carries at least
one tool tip, and by a coupling element (74, 132),

which is disposed in the interior of the basic
body (12) and is axially displaceable with the aid of

the motor arrangement, for receiving a reaming or
drilling tool (76), which engages through a front

central opening (86) of the interchangeable cutting
head (84) and is selectively retractable into the

interior of the basic body (12) and/or of the
interchangeable cutting head (84).
Tool head according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the coupling element is designed as a chuck (74), in
particular as a collet chuck quill.
Tool head according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the coupling element (132) has an internal thread (130)
for receiving the reaming or drilling tool (76), which carries a

complementary external thread (134). 
Tool head according to claim 3, 
characterized in that

the coupling element is mounted with play and locked
against rotation and displacement in a head piece (138)

of the thrust element (18).
Tool head according to claim 4, 
characterized in that

the coupling element (132) comprises an, in contour,
polygonal driver portion (140) and two spherical

cups (142) adjoining the driver portion on opposite
sides.
Tool head according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 a reamer (76) for machining a
tappet guide bush (90) of a cylinder head is

connectable to the coupling element (74, 132).
Tool head according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the interchangeable cutting
head (84) carries an adjustable-angle tool tip (96) for

effecting the high-precision cutting of a valve seat
ring (92), which is coaxial with the tappet guide bush.
Tool head according to claim 7, 
characterized in that

the interchangeable cutting head (84) carries at least
one further tool tip (98, 100) for producing an

external and/or internal chamfer delimiting the valve
seat.
Tool head according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 the power supply device (26)
comprises an inductive current and data transfer link

comprising a primary coil disposed in a machine-side
coil housing (34) and a secondary coil (32) disposed in 

a tool head-side coil housing (30) encircling the tool
shank (16), wherein, when the tool shank (16) is

coupled to the machine spindle (14), the coil
housings (30, 34) are separated from one another by an

air gap.
Tool head according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 a
primary or secondary electronic device connected to the

primary or secondary coil is disposed in the machine-side
and/or tool head-side coil housing (34, 30) for

current conditioning and/or current stabilizing
purposes.
Tool head according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in
that
 the machine-side coil housing (34) extends in a
segment-like manner only over a portion of the

circumference of the tool shank (16), leaving the
predominant portion of the shank circumference free and

forming a clearance to provide access for a tool
gripper.
Tool head according to one of claims 9 to 11,

characterized in that
 the motor arrangement is
numerically controllable via the inductive transfer

link (32, 34).
Tool head according to one of claims 9 to 12,

characterized in that
 the coil housings (30, 34) are
separated from one another by an axial air gap.
