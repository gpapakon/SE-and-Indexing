A control lever device with a cylindrical pivot pin (20) mounted rotatably in a 
housing (11) and connected to a control lever (18), a lever centring spring (80) which 

biases the control lever (18) into a central position, detent means (50, 26, 76) through 
which the control lever (18) is held releasably in a first displaced position and 

attachment means (94, 95) for a transducer (100) which generates electric signals in 
dependence on the position of the control lever (18), characterized in that 


a pivot pin slot (16) is so formed in the housing (11) to receive the pivot pin 
(20) that the control lever (18) can pivot about the pivot pin axis and can slide 

perpendicular to the pivot pin axis, 
the control lever (18) has a first arm (70) projecting from the pivot pin (20) and 
a second arm (72) projecting in the opposite direction from the pivot pin (20) and can 

pivot about the pivot pin axis out of a central position into at least one first displaced 
position and 
at least one stop part is so arranged in the pivoting path of the control lever 
(18) that it only allows the deflection of the control lever (18) out of its central 

position into a displaced position when the control lever (18) is shifted within the pivot 
pin slot (16) perpendicular to the pivot pin axis. 
A control lever device according to claim 1, characterized in that the stop part 
has a curved guide surface (60) which extends along an arc whose centre of curvature 

lies within the pivot pin slot (16), a stop surface (62) which adjoins the guide surface 
(60) and is aligned substantially perpendicular thereto, and a ledge surface (66) which 

adjoins the stop surface (62) and is aligned substantially parallel to the arc, wherein the 
distance between the pivot pin slot (16) and the ledge surface (66) is greater than the 

distance between the pivot pin slot (16) and the guide surface (60), and in that a lever 
arm part (71) preferably projects from the control lever (18) and cooperates with the 

stop surface (62). 
A control lever device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by detent means 
with a part (26, 28) which is movable relative to the housing (11) and includes a first  

 
operating surface (34, 38) generally facing the central region of the housing (11) and 

inclined relative to an arc whose centre lies in the region of the pivot pin slot (16), a 
second operating surface (35, 40) which extends substantially parallel to the arc and a 

spine-like protuberance (33) between the first and second operating surfaces, projecting 
in the direction of the pivot pin slot (16). 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized by 

at least one part (26, 28) movable relative to the housing (11) and comprising a 
second operating surface (35, 39) facing the pivot pin slot (16) and a third operating 

surface (36, 40) which is inclined relative to the second operating surface (35, 39) and 
faces generally away from the control lever (18), insofar as this is in its central 

position, wherein the control lever (18) engages directly or indirectly with the 
operating surfaces (35, 36, 39, 40) in its displaced position, and 
spring means (50) which bias the movable part (26, 28) in the direction of the 
pivot pin slot (16) and form the detent means in conjunction with the movable part (26, 

28) and its operating surfaces (35, 36, 39, 40). 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 

the housing (11) comprises a side wall (12) and a front wall (14) projecting therefrom, 
in that the pivot pin slot (16) is formed in the front wall (14) and/or that the guide 

surface (60), the stop surface (62, 64), the ledge surface (66) and/or the movable part 
(26, 28) are integrated in the housing (11) or formed thereon. 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
at least one projecting, curved wall (30, 32) spaced from the pivot pin slot (16) stands 

out from the side wall (12) and forms an arc whose centre of curvature lies in the 
region of the pivot pin slot (16) and which terminates in the vicinity of the detent 

means. 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the second arm (72) carries a roller (76) which engages with the curved wall (30, 32), 

a stop part (64) and/or the detent means (26, 28) and which first rolls over the curved  
 

wall (30, 32) on pivoting the control lever (18) and then passes beyond its range of 
influence into engagement with the detent means (26, 28). 
A control lever device according to any of claims 3 to 7, characterized in that a 
recess (90) is formed in the housing (11) and at least part of the third operating surface 

(36) is received thereby. 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that 
the housing (11) comprises means (94, 95) for releasable attachment of the transducer 

(100) and in that the second arm (72) comprises means (74) for engaging an input part 
(102) of the transducer (100). 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 
the attachment means for the transducer (100) include a an input arm (102) whose first 

end (106) is coupled to the transducer (100) and whose second end (104) is guided 
slidably in a slot (74) formed at the free end of the second arm (72). 
A control lever device according to any of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
the pivot pin slot (16) extends in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the pivot pin 

along an axis which lies substantially parallel to a stop surface (64).
