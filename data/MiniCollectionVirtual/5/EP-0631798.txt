<ABSTRACT>
A playing device having a display device (20) having in turn a playing display screen (2) and control means (7) for initiating 
a game when a playing medium is deposited and paying back playing media as a reward when certain conditions are met. 

This playing device comprises a deposit counting device (3) for counting the accumulated number of deposited playing media 
and outputting the number so counted, a pay-back counting device (4) for counting the accumulated number of playing media to 

be paid back and outputting the number so counted, calculating means (5) for determining the difference in output numbers between 
the deposit counting device (3) and the pay-back counting device (4) and outputting the difference as the number of playing 

media gained or lost, and memory means (6) for successively storing the number of playing media gained or lost that is output 
from the calculating means (5) every predetermined period of time in relation to each storing time. The control means (7) has a 

processing section (17) for displaying on a part of the playing display screen (2) changes in the number of playing media gained 
or lost that are stored in the memory means (6) in relation to the respective times.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a game machine for displaying a 
game play image on a display screen, to enable a player to play a 
game, and in particular to a game machine having a function of 
displaying information indicating the operation state of the game 
machine. With some game machines in game houses, a player inputs 
game play media such as coins, medals, chips, or balls to the game 
machine in order to start playing a game, and if they satisfy a 
given condition while playing the game, a predetermined number 
of game play media are paid out to the player for the winning 
game, from the game machine. Game machines of this type 
include slot machines and pinball machines, for example. In the game house, as part of management it is necessary to 
know how the game machines operate. For example, at some 
game machines, it may be extremely easy for players to win 
games and at some it may be extremely difficult for players to 
win games. If the number of the former game machines increases, 
the game house suffers a great loss. In contrast, if the number of 
the latter game machines increases, the players lose interest in  
 
playing, and as a result, the game house will lose customers. 
Therefore, in the game house, it becomes necessary to adjust the 
ease with which players can win games for each game machine, 
change locations of the game machines, or replace the game 
machines with new ones. For these purposes, management data is 
required. Management data of this kind includes profit/loss count data 
representing change with time of the difference between the 
number of input game play media and the number of paid-out 
game play media (profit/loss count), for example. Ease of players 
winning games is adjusted by changing a setting of the payout 
rate, a control target value of the ratio of the number of paid-out 
game play media to tile number of input game play media for 
each game machine, based on the data. The management data also includes sales data indicating the 
sales of each game machine. Whether or not specific game 
machines should remain installed and whether or not the locations 
of specific game machines are to be changed are determined by 
management based on the sales data. Management data of this kind is automatically provided and 
stored by a computer or the like which controls the game 
machines in the game house. However, the data on the game 
machines is usually displayed in batch from only on a display or 
the like of a management computer which manages the entire 
game house.
