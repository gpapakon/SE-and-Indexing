<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an N-aryl-α-amino
acid, a photoinitiator composition using an N-aryl-α-amino
acid and a 3-substituted coumarin and/or an
azabenzalcyclohexanone, a photoinitiator composition
using an N-aryl-α-amino acid, a 3-substituted coumarin
and a titanocene,
a photosensitive composition using one member selected
from the group consisting of these photoinitiator
compositions, a photosensitive material using one member
selected from the group consisting of these photoinitiator
compositions and a process for forming patterns
using the photosensitive material.Photosensitive compositions are widely used for
forming letterpresses, relief images, photoresists, and
the like generally using ultraviolet (UV) light as a
light source, and are desired to have a higher sensitivity.
Particularly, when photosensitive compositions
are used for scanning light exposure by means of laser
beams, they are required not only to be highly sensitive
but also to have sufficiently high sensitivity to visible
light (458, 488, 514.5 nm) which is an output wavelength
of an argon laser. Further, in the case of photosensitive
polyimide for thick films usable in semiconductors, 
it is required to have sufficient sensitivity
to a g-line stepper using monochromic light (light of
435 nm), a contact exposing equipment using the whole
wavelengths of a mercury lamp, and a mirror projection
type exposing equipment, and to have good photosensitive
wavelength properties.In order to enhance the sensitivity, various
studies have been done on photoinitiators. As the
photoinitiators, there have been known benzoine and
derivatives thereof, substituted or non-substituted
polynuclear quinones, etc. But substances having
excellent sensitivity meeting the above-mentioned objects
have not been known yet.On the other hand, polyimides or precursors
thereof having photo-patterning properties by themselves
are called as "photosensitive polyimides", which are used
as a surface protective film for semiconductors. In
order to impart photosensitivity to polyimides, various
methods have been known. For example, Japanese Patent
Examined Publication (JP-B) No. 55-41422 proposes a
method for esterifying a poly(amic acid) with hydroxy
acrylate. Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (JP-A)
Nos. 57-170929 and 54-145794 propose to introduce a
photosensitive group by means of a salt bond by mixing
poly(amic acid) with amino acrylate. In the case of the
former (JP-B), the photo-patterning properties are
relatively good, but since it is difficult to obtain a
