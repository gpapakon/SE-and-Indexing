<ABSTRACT>
In a prior art temperature sensor, mechanical-vibration effects can cause the connector leads to break. The aim of the invention is to avoid this and also to shorten the response time of the sensor to changes in temperature. In the temperature sensor (1) proposed, the resistor element (7) is disposed in a flow aperture (14) formed by a U-shaped guard frame (10) which projects out into the flow line (20). At least one of the connection leads (5, 6) has at least one bend point (18) in it which is held in at least one retention slot (17) in the guard frame (10), thus stabilizing the leads (5, 6). The temperature sensor proposed is intended for use in measuring the temperature of the air in an air-intake line in an external-ignition gas-compression-type internal combustion engine.

Temperature probe for measuring the temperature 
of a medium flowing in a flow line of internal combustion 

engines, having a temperature-dependent, electrical 
resistance element exhibiting two rigid connecting wires 

and a carrier body holding the connecting wires, characterized 
in that a protective bracket (10), which encloses 

a flow window (14), is connected to the carrier body (2) 
and the resistance element (7) is disposed in the flow 

window (14) projecting into the flow line (20), and at 
least one of the connecting wires (5, 6) exhibits a 

curved bend point (18, 18'), which projects into at least 
one retaining opening (17, 17') formed in at least one of 

the walls of the protective bracket (10). 
Temperature probe according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the protective bracket (10) has two limbs 

(11, 12) and a base side (13) remote from the carrier 
body. 
Temperature probe according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the protective bracket (10) is firmly 

connected to the carrier body (2) by extrusion coating of 
the limbs (11, 12). 
Temperature probe according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the at least one bend point (18) is 

bonded in the retaining opening (17, 17'). 
Temperature probe according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the protective bracket (10) is part of 

the carrier body (2) and the at least one retaining 
opening (17, 17') for the at least one bend point (18, 

18') is formed in at least one of the walls of the 
protective bracket (10).  

 
Temperature probe according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the connecting wires 

(5, 6) are electrically conductively connected to plug 
lugs (3, 4), which, being disposed parallel to one 

another, extend along the longitudinal axis of the 
carrier body (2) at least partially in the interior of 

the carrier body (2), the carrier body (2) enclosing the 
plug lugs (3, 4) in an insulating fashion. 
Temperature probe according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that an integral plug element (30) is formed 

at that end of the plug lugs (3, 4) which is remote from 
the connecting wires (5, 6). 
Temperature probe according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the carrier body (2) 

penetrates a through-bore (22) formed in the wall of the 
flow line (20) and at least that region (34) of the 

carrier body (2) which is situated in the through-bore 
(22) has a cylindrical external surface with an annular 

groove (24), in which a sealing ring (23) sealing the 
interior of the flow line (20) with respect to the surroundings 

of the flow line (20) is disposed. 
Temperature probe according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that, on the carrier body (2) between plug 

element (30) and the cylindrical external surface, there 
is formed a securing flange (29), by which the depth of 

penetration of the carrier body (2) into the flow line 
(20) is determinable, and the carrier body (2) encloses 

in the securing flange (29) a casing body (35) with a 
through-opening (36), through which the carrier body (2) 

can be fixed to the wall of the flow line (20), for 

example by means of a screw connection. 
Temperature probe according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that those regions of the 

connecting wires (5, 6) of the plug lugs (3, 4) and of 
the resistance element (7) which project into the flowing 

medium are provided with a protective varnish which is 
resistant to chemical and abrasive influences.
