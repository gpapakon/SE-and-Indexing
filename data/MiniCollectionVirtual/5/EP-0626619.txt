<ABSTRACT>
The exposed photosensitive materials are staggered 
into two lines, while being fed to the developing unit, for 

higher efficiency in development. The carrier unit B has a 
staggering unit and a parallel carrier path having a pair 

of parallel paths. The staggering unit staggers the 
photosensitive materials into each of two parallel paths 

alternately while moving in a direction perpendicular to 
the direction of feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for developing photosensitive material
of the type as indicated in the pre-characterizing portion of claim 1. Such an
apparatus is disclosed in DE-A-41 30565. The conveying means of said conventional
apparatus comprises a pair of conveyors which are commonly driven at the same
speed.Ordinarily, on a photograph printing apparatus, a photosensitive materials fed
continuously from a roll to an exposure table provided in the exposure unit where an
image on the negative film is printed on each frame by exposing it to the light. Next,
the photosensitive material is fed to a developing unit by a carrier unit. It is developed
while passing through a tank containing different developing solutions. The
photosensitive material is then dried and the photographs are delivered.The photosensitive material to be exposed to the light on the exposure table is
previously cut into sheets of paper for the convenience of developing. The sheets are
fed in line to the developing unit in which a space of several tens of millimeters is
provided to avoid contact between each pair of sheets of the photosensitive material.In such conventional film printing apparatus, the developing speed for developing the
photosensitive material was usually much lower than the speed for printing the
photosensitive material by exposing it to the light. Thus, 
in order to improve the treatment capacity of the film
printing apparatus, it was necessary to improve the
treatment capacity of the developing unit.However, in such a conventional method, although the
treatment speed for each frame was set as high as possible,
there was a limit. In order to overcome this problem, it
has been proposed to increase the rack length of the
carrier unit for carrying the photosensitive material in
the developing unit to increase the number of the sheets
developed per hour, and thus increase the treatment speed
in the developing unit.With increase in the rack length, the entire size of
the developing unit as well as the size of the tank
increased, too. Thus, the amount of developing solutions,
both main and supplemental solutions, inevitably increased.
For example, in the photosensitive material having a
certain width, to increase the treatment capacity from 500
sheets per hour to 1000 sheets per hour, the rack length
had to be 210 % longer and the amount of the main and
supplemental developing solutions had to be increased to
200 %.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method and apparatus for developing

and a carrier unit (B) for feeding photosensitive material sheets to said developing

unit, wherein said carrier unit comprises a conveying means (20) arranged to feed the
photosensitive material sheets to said developing unit along a plurality of parallel

conveying paths, a staggering unit (10) placed upstream of said conveying means
including a conveyor (13) which, by means of an alternate movement in a direction

perpendicular to the conveying direction, distributes the photosensitive material
sheets from a single fed line over said plurality of parallel conveying paths in a zigzag

arrangement, and variable speed driving means for changing the feeding speed of
said photosensitive material sheets,
characterized in that
 said conveying means (20) comprises a plurality of parallel
conveyors (20A, 20B) and in that each parallel conveyor is separately driven by said

variable speed driving means.
