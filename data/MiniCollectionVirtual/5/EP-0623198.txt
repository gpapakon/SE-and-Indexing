<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE: POWER TRANSMISSIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION:5 This invention relates to power transmission.In a particular aspect this invention relates to the use of a continuously variable output gear system in a power transmission.10BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION:When a front end loader comprising a tractor and an hydraulically operated bucket is used to dig soil,15 substantial power is required at the commencement of lifting of the bucket, commonly called breakout, while at the same time it would be usual for the tractor to be advancing forwardly at a very slow speed. To achieve the power necessary for breakout, it is usual to drive the20 engine of the tractor at high output to generate the necessary power for breakout but this is likely to also cause substantial power to be transmitted to the wheels of the tractor with resultant wheel spin and damage to the tyres.25Similar problems occur with respect to ditch diggers, graders, bulldozers, track vehicles in general and harvesters.30 Many of the above problems can be overcome by the use of a full hydraulic transmission in which an engine drives an» hydraulic pump which in turn drives a motor for the wheels or tracks of a vehicle and further the hydraulic power«* generated can also be used for front end buckets and other35 things.However, such hydraulic transmissions are expensive, have 

substantial losses and require the storage and cooling of large volumes of hydraulic fluid.Applicant has considered the use of continuously variable transmission as a means of controlling speed and/or torque but investigations have shown that continuously variable transmissions have substantial problems as is generally indicated by the following papers:-1.
