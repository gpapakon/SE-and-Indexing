<ABSTRACT>
Radiant energy is directed from a source 
(14,16) to an illumination plane (28) where the light 

receiving ends of groups (36) of optic fibers are 
arranged in coplanar striations (100), after which the 

radiant energy passes through the groups of optic 
fibers into individual exposure columns (40) and on to 

an exposure plane (42) where a radiation sensitive 

sample is exposed in individual areas to different, 
readily adjustable levels of illuminance from each of 

the groups of optic fibers, while shutter means are 
positioned between said source and said illumination 

plane for sequentially illuminating said striations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns methods and 
apparatus for exposing radiation sensitive materials. 
More particularly, the invention concerns sensitometric 
methods and apparatus in which photosensitive papers or 
films are exposed in separate areas to increasing 
illuminance. Then, the exposed papers or films are 
processed and analyzed to determine the density of the 
image produced by the exposure in each area, the 
density being a measure of the acceptability of the 
papers or films. Apparatus known as sensitometers have been used 
for many years to expose samples of photographic papers 
and films in a very precise manner for subsequent 
densitometric analysis in which the density is measured 
of the image produced by such exposure. Such apparatus 
and the associated methods must be capable of exposing 
the photosensitive sample with a high degree of 
precision, accuracy and repeatability. More 
particularly, excellent control must be achieved for 
factors such as the illuminance at the exposure plane 
or the amount of radiant energy per unit area of the 
sample at a given point in time, the exposure time or 
the period during which the sample is exposed to 
radiant energy of such illuminance, the color 
temperature or spectral distribution of the radiant 
energy reaching the sample and the uniformity of the 
exposure across the surface of the sample. In the  
 
testing of photographic films and papers, a further 
concern is to be able to test the sample at 
illuminances, exposure times and color temperatures 
which closely approximate those to which end users 
subject the actual products. For testing purposes 
incident to manufacture of such films and papers, these 
three aspects of the exposure must be controlled more 
precisely than ever would be required by the end user. 
To maintain high productivity, some end users want to 
expose the product at faster and faster shutter times. 
To test a sample at such exposure times, the 
illuminance at the exposure plane must be increased in 
inverse proportion to the exposure time if the sample 
is to receive the same total amount of radiant energy 
as at a slower shutter speed. The flexibility to meet 
such changing test requirements has been largely absent 
from known sensitometric systems in which radiant 
energy requirements are high. In known sensitometers, the radiant energy source 
typically is located far enough away from the sample 
that the sample is essentially uniformly illuminated 
and still receives enough radiant energy for proper 
exposure.
