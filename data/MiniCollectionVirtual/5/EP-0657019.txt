<ABSTRACT>
A wide-field high-resolution airborne camera device for use both as a line-scan camera and as a target-tracking video camera, wherein the wide field is achieved by juxtaposing shots taken at different angles. For this purpose, a video camera (2) is attached to an angular motion assembly so that the camera axis rotates through a series of steps (4-10) about an axis (3) parallel to the direction in which the aircraft (21) is travelling, then swings back to its starting position. The device is further provided with a picture selection unit for taking a picture at each step, whereafter the pictures are transmitted to the ground or recorded on board the aircraft. The device is instantly convertible into a tracking device by directly servo-controlling the camera axis direction.

Wide-field, high-resolution camera device for 
aircraft, of the type comprising: 


a camera (2) capable of taking television-type 
pictures, 
a means for orienting the camera axis (1) of said 
camera about at least one axis (3), 
a means for controlling and monitoring the 
orientation of said camera axis according to several 

successive angular positions (4), (5), (6) in a plane 
perpendicular to the direction of travel (21) of the 

aircraft, 
a means for transmitting images to a remotely-located 
or on-board utilisation means by recording, 
 
characterised in that said camera (2) is of variable 

focal length and in that it comprises: 

a sequencer (26) to compute the focal length of the 
camera, the angle between two successive angular 

positions and the transit time between said two 
successive angular positions, said sequencer using 

width information on the field to be explored, altitude 
data concerning the aircraft and information concerning 

the speed of said aircraft, 
a means for selecting images using signals from the 
camera and from said sequencer. 
Wide-field, high-resolution camera device for 
aircraft as claimed in claim 1 and comprising a 

steerable camera unit composed of a camera (2), fitted 
with a zoom lens (22), mounted on a bracket (38) 

articulated inside a case (36) by means of an axis 
(37), and being controlled about this axis (37) by 

orientation control electronics (27),
 
characterised in that said sequencer (26) computes the 

focal length instruction to be transmitted to said lens 
as a function of the width of the field to be explored,  

 
the number of images to be taken within said width, and 

the altitude of the aircraft, and in that the 
orientation control electronics (27) are controlled by 

said sequencer (26) which computes and produces a 
periodic angular control signal (72) from the 

aircraft's altitude and speed data, the width of the 
field to be explored and the number of images to be 

taken within said width, and in that said periodic 
angular control signal is corrected to offset the roll 

of said aircraft by means of angular speed signals 
provided by a gyrometer (30). 
Wide-field, high-resolution camera device for 
aircraft as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2 and 

mounted mobile on a yaw axis inside another case (40),
 
characterised in that it is automatically controlled by 

a yaw control signal, of saw-tooth shape with a steep 
return edge, also produced by the sequencer (26) from 

the aircraft's altitude and speed, and compensated to 
offset the yaw motion of said aircraft by means of an 

angular speed coming from said gyrometer (44) mounted 
preferably on the case (36). 
Wide-field, high-resolution camera device for 
aircraft as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 or 3,
 
characterised in that it comprises an image selector 

(31) controlled by the sequencer (26), the latter using 
the video signal from the camera (2) to synchronise the 

image selection. 
Wide-field, high-resolution camera device for 
aircraft as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 or 3,
 
characterised in that it comprises a second steerable 

camera unit having its camera axis preferably oriented 
towards the rear of the aircraft in relation to the 

camera axis of the camera (2). 
Wide-field, high-resolution camera device for 
aircraft as claimed in claims 5,
  
 

characterised in that the second steerable camera unit 
is preferably included in the same case (40) and 

comprises a camera (46) fitted with a zoom (52) of 
variable focal lenght and mounted on a bracket (48) 

articulated inside a case (49) by means of an axis 
(54), situated preferably in a vertical plane 

containing the direction of travel (21) of the 
aircraft, driven b
y a motor (51) and providing its 
angular position in relation to the case (49) by means 

of an angle detector (50), the orientation of said axis 
being controlled by orientation control electronics 

(53) from angular control signals coming from the 
sequencer (26) and from angular speed signals coming 

from the gyrometer (30), said case (49) being itself 
mounted mobile about an axis (54), constituting a yaw 

spin axis inside the case (40), and automatically 
controlled by a variable yaw control, the automatic 

control being controlled by a yaw orientation control
