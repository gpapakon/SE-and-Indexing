<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to derivatives of 6,7-dihydroxy-4-thiaheptanoic 
acid, which are useful as 
therapeutic agent of leukocytopenia or thrombocytopenia 
caused by various resons, diseases due to a decrease of 
leukocyte or thrombocyte, diseases requiring, from the 
therapeutic viewpoint, increase of bone marrow cells, 
leukocytes or thrombocytes. In Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift fur Physiologische 
Chemie) 364, 593-606 (1983), a lipoprotein peptide of 
the E. coli origin, which is shown by the formula: 
is disclosed. And, in JPA H4(1992)-46194, WS 1279A substance 
shown by the formula: 
is disclosed. Optical active compounds of these are described in 
JP-AH4(1992)-099796; Chem. Pharm. Bull. 39, 2590-2596 
(1991) and Peptide Chemistry, 29, 361-366 (1991).] However, these 4-thiaheptanoic acid compounds have 
C₁₅H₃₁CO- substituted amino at the 2-position. On the 
other hand, the compounds of the present invention have  
 
amino acid sequence-substituted amino at the 2-position. 
Thus the compounds of the present invention 
are structurally different from prior art compounds as 
mentioned above. Moreover, the prior art references do 
not describe the therapeutic action of 
thrombocytopenia. Abbreviations of amino acid, peptide or the like 
used in the present specification are based on those in 
according with IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical 
Nomenclature or those conventionally used in the 
relevant fields, and possible optical isomers of amino 
acid are L-isomers, unless otherwise specified. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy of cancers causes 
serious leukocytopenia or serious thromobocytopenia. 
The former induces lowering of resistance against 
infections or other various diseases so that sufficient 
therapeutic effects are not expected. The latter 
induces insufficiency of hemostatic mechanism so that 
sufficient therapeutic effects are not expected. These 
are being taken up as a grave concern in the field of 
cancer therapy. Under such circumstances, development 
of drugs, which mitigate the suppression of 
hematopoietic function caused by these therapeutic 
methods and are capable of promoting the recovery of 
leukocyte number or thrombocyte number, has been 
ardently desired. Further, in the therapy by bone 
marrow transplantation, drugs capable of promoting the 
proliferation of bone marrow cells then transplanted 
and capable of recovering the number of leukocyte 
promptly are desired. Furthermore, these drugs can be 
used for therapeutic agents of thrombocytopenia after 
bone marrow
