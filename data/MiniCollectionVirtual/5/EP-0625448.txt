<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle occupant air bag module safety apparatus 
includes an inflatable air bag cushion (48), an inflator 

(50) for inflating the air bag cushion, and a module 
housing (52) or mounting plate for supporting the air bag 

cushion (48) and the inflator (50) on a steering wheel. 
For securing the air bag (48) to the inflator (50) and the 

module housing (52) or mounting plate an annular portion of 
the air bag adjacent its gas inlet opening (49) is clamped 

by studs (78) and nuts (80) directly between the module 
housing (52) located exteriorly of the air bag (48) and an 

inflator flange (60) located interiorly of the air bag 
(48). An annular portion (76) of the air bag (48) 

immediately surrounding its inlet opening (49) is clamped 
between an annular curved portion (74) of the module 

housing (52) and a complementarily curved region of the 
inflator (50) connecting the inflator flange (60) to a 

lower wall portion (68) of the inflator (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inflatable type
occupant restraint system comprising an air bag module
assembly which is provided in automobile or other
automotive vehicles for the protection of the driver
and/or passengers in the event of a collision. More
particularly, the invention relates to an improvement in
the method and means provided for holding the air bag or
cushion in the air bag module assembly.The assembly of an air bag module involves the
manufacture, installation and checking of many
components. Among such components that are common to
all air bag modules are the cover, a cushion, cushion
holder means including an annular retainer or retaining
ring, a supporting plate such as a module housing or
mounting plate, fasteners, a gas generator or inflator,
and means to attach the assembly to a steering wheel,
dashboard or another appropriate part of the vehicle. In such air bag modules, a central inflating gas
inlet opening of an air bag cushion is held, that is,
clamped, between a flange of an inflator and an annular
retaining ring through a module housing or mounting
plate. Rivets or other fasteners are used to attach the
retaining ring to the gas inlet opening of the cushion.
The edge of the opening of the cushion is disposed in a
substantially even manner with the inner circular edge
of the retaining ring. The retaining ring with the air
bag cushion affixed thereto is then bolted to the module
housing and the flange of the inflator with the inflator
so arranged that the flange thereof is positioned
externally of the cushion and the module housing.The force holding the air bag cushion to the
inflator and module housing is concentrated in the
shearing resistance of that part of the cushion which
has a width corresponding to the diameter of the rivet
or other fastener and a length corresponding to the
distance from the rivet to the edge of the gas inlet
opening of the air bag cushion. An example of such an
arrangement is described in patent US 5,002,306.The use of rivets to attach the air bag cushion to
the retaining ring and thereby to the module housing and
inflator is a major cause of reworking inflator module
assemblies in the manufacture thereof. When reworking
is not possible, the defective, air bag modules must be
discarded. This results in lost production and
increased cost of manufacturing. The non use of the
retaining ring and associated rivets or other fasteners
in the manufacture of the air bag module assembly would
eliminate a major cause for reworking and disposal of
defective
