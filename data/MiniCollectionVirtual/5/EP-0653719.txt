<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an electric switch (10) of the type including a trip button (14) which is mounted slideably in a switch casing (12), a movable contact element (62) which is linked to the button (14) and which cooperates with at least one fixed contact element (50, 52) carried by the casing (12) of the switch, and means (44, 62) for elastically restoring the button (14) to a stable rest position, for which the value of the restoring force (F) decreases when the actuation travel (C) of the button (14) exceeds a predetermined value (C1), characterised in that the said predetermined value (C1) of the travel corresponds to the tripping of the switch.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical switch (10) of the type containing an
actuating plunger (14) which is mounted in a sliding manner

in a switch housing (12), a moving contact element (62)
which is connected to the plunger (14) and which interacts

with at least one fixed contact element (50, 52) carried by
the switch housing (12), and means (44, 62) for elastically

returning the plunger (44) to a stable position of rest, in
which the value of the return force (F) decreases when the

actuating travel (C) of the plunger (14) exceeds a
predetermined value (C1), characterised in that said

predetermined value (C1) of travel corresponds to the
actuation of the switch, and in that the value of the

return force (F) increases then decreases during the
actuating travel, passing through a maximum (Fmax)

corresponding to actuation of the switch.
Switch according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
elastic return means contain at least one return spring

(44) arranged between the plunger (14) and the switch
housing (12) and which pushes the plunger (14) into its

stable position of rest.
Switch according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
return spring is an arched coil spring (44) arranged inside

the housing (12) and which extends in a transverse
direction substantially perpendicular to the direction of

displacement of the plunger (14) whose triggering end (40)
interacts with the convex central part (42) of the arched

spring (44).
Switch according to Claim 3, characterised in that
each end (46) of the spring (44) is accommodated in a

housing (48) whose axis is inclined with respect to the
direction of displacement of the plunger (14) so as to give

the spring (44) a stable curvature at rest, the convexity 
(42) of which is directed towards the triggering end of the

plunger (14).
Switch according to any one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the moving contact (62) includes at

least one elastically deformable contact blade (68, 70), a
free end (76, 78) of which interacts with the fixed contact

element (50, 52) and which, in the rest position of the
plunger, exerts an elastic force on the plunger (14) which

opposes the force exerted on the return spring.
Switch according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
contact blade (68, 70) extends in a direction substantially

parallel to the direction of sliding of the plunger (14)
and in that its free end (76, 78) interacts with a ramp

(58, 60) which is formed on the fixed contact (50, 52) and
which is inclined with respect to the direction of

displacement of the plunger (14).
Switch according to one of Claims 5 or 6,

characterised in that in the rest position of the plunger,
the free end (76, 78) of the elastically deformable contact

blade (68, 70) is in electrical contact with the fixed
contact element (50, 52) so as to apply to the plunger (14)

an elastic force opposed to that which is applied to it by
the return spring (44).
Switch according to any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the switch has symmetry of design

with respect to a median plane passing through the axis of
displacement of the plunger (14).
Switch according to Claim 8 taken in conjunction with
any one of Claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the moving

contact (62) contains two elastically deformable contact
blades (68, 70) arranged symmetrically on either side of

the body (24) of the plunger (14). 
Switch according to any one of the preceding Claims,
for detecting the presence of a card (C) in a device for

reading the data contained in the card, in particular an
electronic memory card, characterised in that an actuating

end (18, 88) of the plunger (14) projects from the housing
(12) in order to interact with the front transverse edge

(16) of the card perpendicular to the direction (I) of
insertion of the card, the actuating plunger (14) being

mounted in a sliding manner in a direction substantially
parallel to the direction (I) of insertion of the card.
