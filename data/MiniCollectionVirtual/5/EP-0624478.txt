<ABSTRACT>
A computer printer tray system comprising a paper 
input tray (20) and a paper output tray (70), neither of which 

is required to have any moving parts. The output tray (70) is 
supported in part by the input tray (20) and both trays of the 

system are semi-permanently cantilever supported from the front 
of the printer so that neither tray has to be removed when 

loading an unprinted stack of cut sheet paper or removing 
printed paper. The output tray (70) has a first portion (74) 

which is inclined from a second portion (76) by about 10° to 
correct paper curl caused by a wet printing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to paper input and output 
trays for computer driven printers, and, more particularly, for 
inkjet printers. Inkjet printers have been provided with permanently 
attached paper input trays which necessarily give the printer a 
larger footprint during shipping thus requiring larger containers 
than are required for printers having detachable paper input 
trays. Printer paper input and output trays are regularly 
accessed by the printer operator and may be removable or 
permanently attached trays. The former are removed from the 
printer whenever the paper supply is exhausted for refilling with 
a stack of cut sheet paper. Printers with removable trays, e.g. as shown in EP-A-0 498 561, occupy 
a smaller footprint and therefore can be shipped in smaller 
containers but they have other drawbacks. Removable trays 
usually have a spring biased pusher plate beneath the paper stack 
for urging paper upwardly toward the printer feed rollers which 
remove one sheet at a time from the stack. Repeated removal, 
loading and reinstallation of the paper tray in the printer is 
a relatively easy task provided that care is taken to properly 
remove the tray, load the paper and reinstall the tray. Despite 
ordinary precautions, through repeated usage, removable paper 
trays, and the parts thereon such as the pusher plate and 
particularly the parts thereof that connect the tray to the 
printer, are subject to wear and eventual breakage. Similarly, paper output trays are ordinarily easily 
removable trays which are hung on the front of the printer with 
plastic hooks or the like which are subject to breakage.  
 
Particularly in printers such as inkjet printers which apply 
print to the paper using wet ink, paper curl which usually takes 
place about the long center axis of the paper is also a problem. Accordingly, a semi-permanently attached paper tray 
system for a printer such as an inkjet printer is desired which, 
after installation by the user, is intended to remain in place 
on the printer even during paper loading so as to minimize the 
frequency of tray removal and attendant breakage. Both trays of 
the system should still be removable when desired without special 
tools and both trays should be easily accessible, preferably from 
the front of the printer, whereby paper can be loaded into the 
input tray without removal of either the paper input tray or the 
paper output tray. The paper input tray preferably should have 
no moving parts. The present invention provides a paper input

<CLAIMS>
A paper input tray (20) for a printer comprising: a 
generally horizontal paper shelf (22), a pair of upstanding 

sidewalls (24, 26) and a front endwall (29) having a portion 
extending upwardly from said shelf (22), each of said sidewalls 

(24, 26) having a cantilevered tray support arm (25, 27) extending 
rearwardly therefrom, said arms each having an upper edge (28, 40) 

for supporting a paper output tray (70) and a hook (34, 46) at a 
free end thereof, each hook being receivable in a pocket (60, 62) 

in said printer (10), characterised in that at least one of said 
arms (25, 27) is resilient so that it latches semi-permanently in 

its pocket (60, 62) to retain the input tray (20) in position on 
said printer. 
A computer printer paper tray system comprising: a paper 
input tray (20); a paper output tray (70); and means (28, 40) for 

supporting said output tray on said input tray cantilevered from 
a printer (10); said input tray being as defined in claim 1. 
The tray system of claim 2, wherein said at least one hook 
includes a bevelled camming surface (36) which causes said hook 

to move horizontally against the bias of said resilient arm as 
said hooks are inserted into said pockets, said hooks also having 

a forwardly facing stop shoulder (38) engageable with a rearwardly 
facing stop shoulder (58) in said pocket to resist removal of said 

input tray from said printer. 
The paper tray system of claim 2 or 3, wherein said tray 
support surfaces on said arms extend in generally horizontal 

planes. 
The paper tray system of claim 4, wherein said arms comprise 
inverted channels each having spaced vertically extending interior 

and exterior flanges (30, 32; 42, 44) and a horizontal web (28, 
40). 
The paper tray system of claim 5, wherein said interior 
flanges (32, 42) are each resilient in a horizontal direction and 

have a shaped male end (33, 43) which facilitates insertion of 
said arms into complimentary shaped female receiving apertures in  

 
said printer, said hooks (34, 46) being on said male ends. 
The paper tray system of claim 6, wherein said arms each 
have an abutment thereon which prevents insertion of said arms 

into said apertures beyond predetermined limits. 
The paper tray system of claim 7, wherein said resilient arm 
(27) is longer than the other arm (25) to provide greater 

horizontal movement of said hook thereon. 
The paper tray system of claim 8, further comprising 
interengaging means 
(37, 47; 110, 112) on said input tray and said 
output tray to position said output tray on said input tray. 
The paper tray system of claim 9, wherein said interengaging 
means comprise upwardly facing notches (37, 47) on said support 

surfaces (28, 40) and downwardly facing projections (110, 112) on 
the paper output tray (70). 
The paper tray system of claim 10, further comprising a 
downwardly extending resilient rearwardly facing hook (48, 49) on 

said shelf for engaging printer structure to resist upward 
movement of the front edge of said paper input tray (20). 
The paper tray system of any of claims 2 to 11, wherein said 
output tray (70) comprises a shelf having a front horizontal 

portion (74) and a rear portion (76) downwardly inclined from said 
front portion, a pair of side walls (78, 80) and a rear end wall 

(82) each upwardly extending from said rear portion; a pair of 
downwardly extending guide ears (88, 90) at the lateral edges of 

said rear portion, each ear having a rearwardly open generally 
horizontally extending elongated slot (92, 94) therein; said tray 

having a rearwardly and forwardly extending guide wing (100) 
depending downwardly from the undersurface of said rear portion 

proximate one side edge thereof, said wing having a rearwardly and 
upwardly extending guide surface (102) and a forwardly and 

upwardly extending guide surface (104) respectively for engaging 
printer structure (50) for lifting said one tray edge during 

attachment to and removal of the tray from the printer; and a 
horizontally extending output tray support surface (107, 109) on 

the underside of said inclined portion beneath said side walls  
 

thereof. 
The paper tray system of claim 12, further comprising a 
vertically extending stop surface thereon on each of said 

sidewalls to prevent insertion of said output tray into said 
printer beyond a predetermined limit. 
The paper tray system of claim 13, wherein said output tray 
guide wing (100) is located laterally inwardly of the sidewall 

closest thereto and laterally outwardly of the ear on said 
sidewall. 
The paper tray system of claim 12, wherein said rear portion 
(76) is inclined about 10° from said front portion (74). 
A computer printer (10) comprising: a chassis (50, 60); a 
paper input tray (20); a paper output tray (70); and means for 

semi-permanently supporting said output tray on said input tray 
cantilevered from said chassis; said input tray being as defined 

in claim 1.
