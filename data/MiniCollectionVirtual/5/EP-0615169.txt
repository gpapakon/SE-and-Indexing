<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a sheet convey 
apparatus comprising a sheet stacking plate, supply 

means for conveying a sheet from the sheet stacking 
plate to a treatment portion, convey means for 

conveying the sheet on the treatment portion, 
discharge means for discharging the sheet from the 

treatment portion onto the sheet stacking plate again, 
and an apparatus body cover. Wherein, the sheet 

stacking plate cooperates with the cover to form a 
substantially horizontal sheet stacking surface and 

is arranged immediately above the convey means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet
convey apparatus for automatically supplying and
discharging a sheet with respect to a treatment
portion. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a sheet convey apparatus adapted to
automatically supply and discharge a sheet with
respect to an image reading portion of an image
forming apparatus such as a copying machine, laser
beam printer (LBP), image reading apparatus, image
recording apparatus and the like, and an image forming
apparatus having such a sheet convey apparatus.Fig. 12 shows an example of a conventional
sheet convey apparatus. The sheet convey apparatus
shown in this example is an original (document) feed
apparatus (ADF).In Fig. 12, a platen glass 2 acting as an
image reading treatment portion is fixed to an upper
surface of a body 1 of an image forming apparatus such
as a copying machine, LBP and the like. An internal
construction of the image forming apparatus will be
described later.An original convey apparatus including the 
platen glass 2 is generally designated by the
reference numeral 3 and is mounted on the upper
surface of the image forming apparatus. The original
convey apparatus 3 comprises an outer cover (main
cover) 4, and an original tray 5 acting as an original
stacking plate on which sheet originals S are stacked
in such a manner that leading or tip ends of the sheet
originals are inserted in an original inlet portion
20.When a semi-circular sheet supply roller 6 is
rotated in response to an original supply start
signal, a positive feeding force is applied to a
lowermost sheet original of the sheet original stack
S on the original tray 5, and the lowermost sheet
original alone is separated from the other sheet
originals at a separation and supply portion
comprising a feed roller 7 and a separation belt 8,
and the separated sheet original is supplied into the
original convey apparatus 3. The separated sheet
original passes through a sheet path a, a pair of
regist rollers 9 and a sheet path b, and is sent
between the platen glass 2 and a rotatable original
convey belt 10.The pair of regist rollers 9 serve to correct
the skew-feed of the sheet original by abutting the
tip end of the sheet original against a nip between
the rollers and also to provide the sheet supply 
timing with respect to the platen glass 2.The rotatable original convey belt 10 serves
to convey the sheet original on the platen glass 2,
and extends between and wound around a drive roller
11 disposed at a left end of the platen glass 2 and
a turn roller 12

<CLAIMS>
A sheet convey apparatus comprising:

a sheet stacking plate (5);
supply means (6) for conveying a sheet from said sheet
stacking plate (5) to a treatment portion (2);
convey means (13) for conveying the sheet on said
treatment portion (2);
discharge means (14) for discharging the sheet from said
treatment portion (2) onto said stacking plate (5) again;

and
the sheet stacking plate (5) being substantially
horizontally arranged above said convey means (13),
characterized in that
said sheet stacking plate (5) cooperates with an apparatus
body cover (4) to provide a substantially horizontal original

stacking surface above said treatment portion (2),
wherein said discharge means (14) discharges the sheet
reversely conveyed by a reverse rotation of said convey means

(13) from said treatment portion onto said sheet stacking plate 
(5) again from the same side as said supply means (6), and said

discharge means (14) is arranged above and upstream of said
supply means (6) in a sheet supplying direction so that a trail

end of the sheet discharged onto said stacking plate viewed in
a discharging direction thereof is located upstream of said

sheet supply means (6) viewed in the sheet supply direction.
A sheet convey apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising sheet re-supply preventing means (35) for preventing

the sheet discharged on said sheet stacking surface from re-supplying.
A sheet convey apparatus according to claim 2, further
comprising sort means (32, 33) for sorting non-treated sheets

rested on said sheet stacking surface and to be supplied to
said treatment portion from the sheets discharged onto said

sheet stacking surface.
A sheet convey apparatus according to claim 2, further
comprising a stopper member (34) adapted to be abutted against

an upper surface of a stack of the sheets rested on said sheet
stacking surface and to be supplied, said stopper member being

arranged between a discharge opening (15) of said discharge
means (14) through which the sheet is discharged onto said

sheet stacking plate and said supply means.
A sheet convey apparatus according to claim 2, further
comprising holding means (60) for holding tip ends of the

sheets discharged onto said sheet stacking surface, said tip
end being a leading end of the sheet in a sheet discharging

direction.
An automatic original reading apparatus which has a
sheet convey apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 and in

which the sheet on said treatment portion is read by an optical
system. 
An image forming apparatus which has a sheet convey
apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 and in which the

sheet on said treatment portion is read by an optical system
and an image is formed at an image forming

portion to produce a copy sheet.
