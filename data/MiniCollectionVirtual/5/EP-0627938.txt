<DESCRIPTION>
 A pH SENSITIVE, REVERSIBLE GELLING, ERODIBLE DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMField of the InventionThe present invention relates in general to sustained release gel-like drug delivery systems. More particularly, the present invention is directed to liquid mixtures of poly( ethylvinylether/maleic acid) intended for use in treating and diagnosing ocular diseases and diseases in similar physiological environments. The erodible drug delivery systems reversibly gel in response to changes in pH and adhere to mucosa making them particularly suitable for use as dropable or injectable drug delivery systems for the sustained delivery of pharmaceutical compounds.Background of the InventionA problem with the administration of many pharmaceutical compounds and diagnostic compounds has been the need to retain sufficient quantities of these compounds in contact with the target tissues for a period of time sufficient to accomplish the therapeutic or diagnostic purpose. This problem is particularly acute in connection with compounds administered to the eye. In the ocular environment, tear turnover and drainage through the lacrimal system quickly remove a major portion of any compound administered directly to the eye so that only a small fraction of the original dosage remains in the eye for an extended period of time. In order to keep the pharmaceutical compound present at a therapeutic level, repeated administrations of fairly large doses are required to compensate for the loss from tear turnover and drainage. Similar problem are also encountered in connection with the nasal mucosa, oral cavity and similar physiological environments.Early approaches to the solution of the problems associated with ocular drug delivery systems utilized semi-solid ointments or gels applied directly to the 

conjunctiva or cul-de-sac of the eye to retain the pharmaceutical agents contained therein on the ocular surface. Though reasonably effective at retaining adequate drug dosages in contact with the surface of the eye, a major disadvantage associated with ointments and gels is the difficulty in delivering controlled amounts. Many patients experience difficulty in applying the appropriate amount of the ointment or gel to the eye. Additionally, many of the ointments and gels cause unpleasant side effects including blurred vision and the formation of crusts around the eye and on the eyelids.Another problem associated with the use of semi-solid gels and ointments is the tendency for many of these delivery systems to migrate within the cul-de-sac or
