<ABSTRACT>
Air bag apparatus comprises at least an air bag (114) 
for protecting a driver of a vehicle upon collision of the 

vehicle, a base plate (108) for mounting thereon a gas 
inflator for inflating the air bag, and a pad cover 

(107) secured to the base plate (108) for accommodating the 
air bag and the gas inflator therein. Part of the base 

plate (108) is deformed into a predetermined shape to secure 
the pad cover (107) to the base plate. 
Preferably, part of the base plate (108) is bent to form a 
side inner face portion and is further folded back to 

form a side outer face portion, and a terminal portion 
of the pad cover (107) is held between and secured by 

the side outer face portion and the side inner face 
portion of the base plate (108). Methods and apparatus (101,102,104) for 

assembly of the air bag system are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure relates to air bag apparatus for
mounting on a steering wheel, front instrument panel,
front door trim or the like of an automobile, and more
particularly to the arrangement for mounting and securing
the pad cover of such apparatus onto a base plate which
is mounted on the steering wheel etc. by way of a
mounting plate or a like element.The present disclosure relates also to an assembling
process for such air bag apparatus.The pad cover is also referred to in the art as
"module cover", "receiving cover", "lid", "cover door" or
"deployment door", and is used as a case or housing for
receiving an air bag or acting as cushioning.Known arrangements of the type mentioned are
disclosed, for example, in JP-A-55/110643, JP-A-63/184549,
JP-A-4/27639 and US-A-5201541.FIG. 24 shows the arrangement of JP-A-4/27639. Air
bag apparatus includes an air bag 21 mounted on a
mounting plate 23 and an air bag cover 24 which covers
the air bag 21. An upright portion 26 extends around the
edge of a flat portion 23A of the mounting plate 23 on
which the air bag 21, an inflator 22 and a ring-like bag
retainer 18 are mounted. A side wall 25 of the air bag
cover 24 is held against the upright plate portion 26 by
an outer stiffening collar 12 secured by rivets 13. This 
is a "rivet type" mounting arrangement.FIG. 25 shows the arrangement of JP-A-55/110643. A
mounting plate 23 and the circumferential wall 25 of the
air bag cover 24 are snapped together by a pawl plate 14
and a retaining wall 16 around the mounting plate's edge
which fits in an insertion groove 17 around the lower
face of the cover wall 25. The arresting pawl 15 engages
a groove 28 on the inner face of the cover wall 25. This
is a "snap-in type" mounting arrangement.These conventional arrangements use a plurality of
plates or parts and the structure is complicated.
Consequently, the number of production steps is large,
leading to high cost. Also the device is heavy which at
a central portion of a steering wheel results in a large
moment of inertia around the axis of the steering wheel.US-A-5201541, which shows the features of the preamble of
claim 1 describes air bag apparatus in which
the upturned periphery of the base plate has a series of
resilient fingers, each bent outwardly and downwardly at
its top so as to snap through corresponding slits in the
re-entrant downward wall of the cover which is pushed
over it, trapping the cover in place.General aims herein are proposals of new and useful
structures for air bag mountings, and methods and means

<CLAIMS>
Air bag apparatus for vehicle driver protection
comprising an air bag (1), a base plate (3) for mounting

a gas generator (2) for inflating the air bag, and a pad
cover (4) to accommodate the air bag and gas generator,

the pad cover having a lower extremity (5) at which it is
secured to the base plate (3),

characterised in that

for securing the pad cover (4) the base plate (3) is
formed with a downwardly-extending part forming an

outwardly-directed inner face portion (6), a bottom
portion (6A) contiguous with the inner face portion (6)

and extending outwardly from the bottom thereof, and an
inwardly-directed outer face portion (7) extending

upwardly from the bottom portion (6A), the lower
extremity (5) of the pad cover being held caulked between

the opposed inner and outer face portions (6,7) so as to
be secured thereto.
Apparatus according to claim 1 in which the pad
cover (4) is trapped against removal from the base plate

(3) by mechanical interlock of the lower extremity (5)
thereof with the inner face portion (6) or outer face

portion (7).
Apparatus according to claim 1 in which the
lower extremity (5) of the pad cover (4) has an

outwardly-projecting flange (5A) and the outer face
portion (7) has a part (7A) extending inwardly above the 

flange (5A) to prevent escape thereof from between the
inner and outer face portions (6,7).
Apparatus according to claim 1 in which the pad
cover's lower extremity (5) has a hole (10) or groove (8)

engaged by an inwardly-projecting part (7A) of the outer
face portion (7) or an outwardly-projecting part (9,9A)

of the inner face portion (6).
Apparatus according to claim 4 in which the
inwardly-projecting or outwardly-projecting part

(7A,9,9A) has the form of a pawl angled to resist removal
of the pad cover from the base plate.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims in which the inner and outer face portions (6,7)

and bottom portion (6A) are provided as an elongate
formation extending continuously along a side of the base

plate (3).
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims in which the base plate (3) has a central flat

plate portion (3A) for mounting the gas generator (2) and
air bag (3), with a peripheral downward bend to said

downwardly-extending part forming the inner face portion
(6).
A method of making air bag apparatus as defined
in claim 2 in which the pad cover (4) is positioned on

the base plate (3) and the periphery of the base plate
for forming the outer face portion (7) is then deformed

inwardly to form the mechanical interlock between the 
base
 plate periphery and the pad cover's lower extremity
(5).
A method of making air bag apparatus according
to any one of claims 1 and 3-7 in which the pad cover (4)

is positioned on the base plate (3) and the base plate
periphery is deformed to bring the inner and outer face

portions (6,7) into the caulking relationship with the
pad cover's lower extremity (5).
A method according to claim 9 in which said
deformation is made by means of a cam slide apparatus disposed

around the air bag apparatus which acts to convert a
vertical pressing force into a horizontal caulking force

acting on the outer face portion (7) of the base plate
(3) to deform it inwardly.
