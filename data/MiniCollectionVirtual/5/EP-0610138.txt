Preparation process for the compounds of formula (I): 

 
in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an ester remainder, 

characterized in that a compound of formula (II): 

 
is treated with an oxidizing degradation agent, in order to 

obtain a compound of formula (III): 

 
of which the ketone function in position 3 is protected in 

the form of the enol ether or ester and, if appropriate, of 
which the acid function in position 17beta is protected in 

the form of the ester, in order to obtain a compound of 
formula (IV):  

 

 
in which R is defined as previously and R
1
 represents a 
remainder of enol ether or ester, on which an electrophilic 

fluorination agent is reacted, in order to obtain a compound 
of formula (V): 


 
which is treated with a nucleophilic fluorination agent, in 

order to obtain the expected compound of formula (I), which, 
if appropriate, when R represents an ester remainder, is 

saponified in order to obtain the corresponding acid. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
firstly the acid function of the compound of formula (III) is 

protected, in order to obtain a compound of formula (III'): 

 
in which R' represents an ester remainder, of which the 

ketone function in position 3 is protected in the form of the  
 

enol ether or ester, in order to obtain a compound of formula 
(IV) as defined in claim 1, in which R has the definition of 

R' indicated above and the synthesis is continued as 
indicated in claim 1. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that in 
the same operation the ketone function in position 3 and the 

acid function in position 17beta are protected in the form of 
the enol ether and ester respectively, in order to obtain a 

compound of formula (IV) as defined in claim 1, in which R 
and R
1
 represent the same protector group and the synthesis 
is continued as indicated in claim 1. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that only 
the ketone function in position 3 is protected in the form of 

the enol ether or ester, in order to obtain a compound of 
formula (I) as defined in claim 1, in which R represents a 

hydrogen atom, then the synthesis is continued as indicated 
in claim 1. 
Process according to any one of claims 1, 2, or 4, 
characterized in that the ketone in position 3 is protected 

in the form of the enol ester. 
Process according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 5, 
characterized in that the acid function in position 17beta is 

protected in the form of the alkyl ester. 
Process according to claim 1 or 3, characterized in that 
the ketone function in position 3 and the acid function in 

position 17beta are protected in the form of the silylated 
ether and ester respectively. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the oxidizing degradation agent is 

periodic acid. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the electrophilic fluorination agent is 

N-fluoro N-chloromethyl triethylene diamine bis tetrafluoroborate. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the nucleophilic fluorination agent is 

the hydrofluoric acid - dimethylformamide complex.

or fluorine atom and Y combined with the dotted lines 
represents a 3-keto 4 system or X represents a hydrogen 

atom and Y combined with the dotted lines represents a 
3-OR
1
 3,5 system, R
1
