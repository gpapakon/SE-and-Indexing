<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fabric softening compositions which contain
as essential constituent a biodegradable quaternary ammonium compound.
Softening compositions of the above-mentioned type have earlier been
suggested in US-A-A 767 547. Preferred among the plurality of
compositions described therein are those containing as essential
constituent compounds of the formula
N,N-di(alkanoyl-oxy-ethyl)-N,N-dimethyl ammonium chloride, their
principal representative being
N,N-di(tallowoyl-oxy-ethyl)-N,N-dimethyl ammonium chloride.
However, further improvement of the biodegradability of said compounds
was desired, as was further improvement of their toxicity to algae and
their suitability to form concentrated dispersions and/or solutions. WO-A-91/16880 relates to liposomes containing quaternary ammonium compounds
and to a process for the preparation of said liposomes. This document does not
relate to the technical problem of the instant invention, i.e. the provision of a fabric
softening composition containing as essential constituent a biodegradable quaternary
ammonium compound. In Examples 11 and 14 two compounds are disclosed, i.e.
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-N,N,N-trimethylglycine ester chloride and 1,3-dioleoylglycero-2-N,N,N-trimethylglycine
ester chloride, for which no protection is sought.JP-A-59142299 discloses cationic surfactants comprising a long-chain fatty acid
ester of a cationised polyol containing a tertiary or quaternary nitrogen substituent
and their use in detergents and shampoos. These compounds bear no chemical
relation to the compounds of the presently claimed composition. The invention now provides fabric softening compositions comprising
quaternary ammonium compounds which, by and large, satisfy the above-listed
desires.The invention consists in that the fabric softening compositions of
the known type mentioned in the opening paragraph contain as essential
constituent a quaternary ammonium compound of the formula:
wherein X is an anion, A is an (m+n) valent radical remaining after
the removal of (m+n) hydroxy groups from an aliphatic polyol,
natural polyol, oligomer and/or polymer containing repeating units of vinyl alcohol
having p
hydroxy groups and an atomic ratio of carbon to oxygen in the range of
1,0 to 3,0 and up to 2 groups per hydroxy group selected from ethylene
oxide and propylene oxide,m is 0 or an integer from 1 to p-n, n is an integer from 1 to p-m, andp is an integer of at least 2,B is an alkylene or alkylidene group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are,
