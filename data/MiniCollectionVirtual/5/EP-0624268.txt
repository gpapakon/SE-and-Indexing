<ABSTRACT>
A system and devices for publication of newspapers and the like. The system uses an electronic memory/display unit (24) which preserves the convenience of printed material, but which has the advantages of a computer display. The system utilizes a cable television (CATV) network to distribute the information. Data are transmitted over the system from a newspaper publication facility (2). The newspaper publication facility is provided with a data processing facility (4) that transmits newspaper data (6) to a satellite transmitting facility (8). The transmitted data are provided to a cable television satellite receiving station (12) by way of satellite link (14). Signal generators (16) are coupled to the satellite link and provide appropriate signals to a CATV network transmission facility (18). Network transmission facility (18) transmits newspaper signals over a CATV line (20) to a plurality of subscriber facilities (22) with the electronic memory/display units.

<DESCRIPTION>
WO 91/05436 discloses a publication system comprising (a) means at
a publisher's facility for producing a periodical in digital form, (b) means for
transmission by satellite to a cable television service provider, and (c) a memory
and display system at a subscriber location.WO 91/12578 discloses a portable computer adapted for facilitated data
collection and recording.The present invention relates to the field of
computer devices and especially computer devices for
publishing information such as text and graphics. In one
specific embodiment, the invention provides a method and
device for publication of materials such as newspapers,
magazines, and the like.The classical system for publication of
newspapers and magazines in paper form presents a number
of difficulties. For example, the cost of the present
methods of printing and distribution tend to be quite
high. This high cost results from a number of factors
including high and increasing labor costs, high material
costs, and the like. It has been estimated that the cost
of printing and delivering a newspaper is 50 to 60% of
the cost of providing a newspaper to the consumer.Additional problems result from the
environmental and monetary cost of disposing of used
paper products such as newspapers. Approximately 1000
acres of trees are estimated to have been cut for the
printing of a single Sunday edition of the United State's
newspapers. Recycling has been widely adopted, but about
66% of all newspapers still continue to be deposited in
landfills. Even when recycling has been adopted, it
results in a degree of inconvenience to the consumer,
and requires the construction of the infrastructure to 
implement the recycling program at substantial cost. The
volume of waste generated by the newspaper industry is
particularly disturbing when one considers that the
average reader actually reads only 10 to 20% of a
newspaper.Other problems with conventional newspapers
also exist. For example, ink rub-off is frequently
a problem which has not been overcome. Further,
advertisement in a newspaper is relatively inefficient
from the advertiser's viewpoint since it is relatively
untargeted. Still further, timeliness of newspaper
delivery is a problem since the content for a 6:00 A.M.
newspaper is typically set in large part by 8:00 P.M.
the preceding day. These time restraints also create
language barriers. Although a newspaper could quickly be
translated into various languages, the time for actually
printing the newspaper in various languages often makes
timely
