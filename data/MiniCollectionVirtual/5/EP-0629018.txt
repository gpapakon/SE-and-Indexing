electric heating type defogger having heating strips and 

a bus bar for feeding a current to the heating strips and 
an antenna conductor having antenna strips arranged to 

form a pattern, which are fitted on the rear window glass 
fitted to a rear window opening formed in an automobile, 

wherein the defogger and the antenna conductor are spaced 
apart from each other with a predetermined small space in 

a capacitive coupling relation so that a high frequency 
current is caused to flow but a direct current is not 

caused to flow between them; a reactance circuit is 
connected to the defogger to effect anti-resonance 

between the defogger and the rear window opening of the 
body of the automobile at the central frequency in terms 

of logarithmic scale of a broadcast frequency band 
region; a quality factor value is determined by the 

inductance of a chock coil in the reactance circuit and 
the stray capacitance between the defogger and the rear 

window opening of the body of the automobile so that the 
ratio of an input impedance to a receiver to the 

impedance of the antenna conductor viewed from the side 
of a power feeding terminal becomes 1; and a matching 

circuit is inserted between the power feeding terminal of 
the antenna conductor and the receiver so that the sum of 

the impedance of the antenna conductor viewed from the 
side of the input terminal of the receiver and the  

 
functional part as an antenna in the rear window glass

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna device 
for an automobile for suppressing generation of noises. As an antenna device for receiving radio waves for an 
automobile, there has been known such ones having antenna 
conductors for AM broadcasts, FM broadcasts or AM/FM 
broadcasts which are provided on the surface or inside 
the rear window glass of the automobiles instead of rod 
antenna. The antennas provided on or in the rear window 
glass of the automobiles, having no part projecting from 
the car body unlike the rod antenna or the lid antenna, 
have many advantages that they are harmless to persons, 
are not easily broken, do not become rusty, hence there 
is no change of performance, and provide excellent 
appearance for the automobiles. In such type of antenna devices, it is possible to 
obtain desired performance, i.e. increasing a gain of 
antenna by suitably designing the pattern of an antenna 
conductor or antenna conductors provided on or in a glass 
plate. However, the surface area of the glass plate is  
 
not sufficiently large when the antenna device is 
installed in a window glass for an automobile. 
Accordingly, the distance between the antenna conductors 
and the body of an automobile can not be sufficiently 
large, whereby a leak current from the antenna conductor 
is large and a gain of antenna becomes insufficient. In case of the antenna device to be installed in or 
on the rear window glass of an automobile, an electric 
heating type defogger for preventing the rear window 
glass from being cloudy is provided together with the 
antenna conductor formed in a predetermined pattern. In 
particular, when the antenna conductor is placed reclose 
to a heater, a current in the antenna conductor leaks to 
the body of the automobile through the power feeding part 
of the electric heating type defogger thereby resulting 
in a loss of the gain. In order to eliminate the loss of 
gain, there has been proposed to attach a choke coil to a 
suitable position of a power feeding point of the 
electric heating type defogger. However, there is a 
tendency of reducing the antenna gain because the choke 
coil has not a sufficient high frequency current 
preventing function when the choke coil is used for an 
antenna device for an automobile. In a conventional antenna device, there was practiced 
to insert a pre-amplifier 331 at a suitable position of a 
power feeding line between the power feeding terminal 311 
of antenna conductors 306 and a radio wave receiver 312  
 
in order to compensate a
