<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel polytelomerization process 
and to the materials so produced. Such products shall be referred 
to as polytelomers. Some of these polytelomers have been 
found to have adhesive properties. It is known that free radical polymerization of monomers, e.g. 
styrene, esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid, butadiene, and 
their mixtures, give polymers that have been widely used as 
plastics, rubbers, adhesives, etc. as is described in textbooks 
of polymer science, e.g. L. Mandelkern: An Introduction to Macromoleculs, 
Springer Verlag, New York, 1972, chap. 1. The molecular 
weight of such polymers is controlled by small amounts of chain 
transfer agents (typically less than 3%), as is commonly known 
and described, e.g. in the book by. G. Odian: "Principles of 
Polymerization", John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1970, chaps. 3.5 
and 3.6. The process known as telomerization is also mentioned in 
this book on p. 226-227. In this process the products so obtained 
have a very low molecular weight which is achieved by using a 
large amount of a chain transfer agent (typically 3-50%) of the 
total composition. The present invention is concerned with sequentially 
combined processes of polymerization and telomerization, 
which shall be referred to as polytelomerization. The 
products of this process shall be referred to as polytelomers. 
The kind and amount of monomers and chain transfer agents to be 
used in the first polymerization process shall be referred to as 
the polymeric stage, and the kind and amount of monomers and 
chain transfer agents to be used in the second telomerization 
process shall be referred to as the telomeric stage. The polymeric 
and telomeric stages generally (but not necessarily) differ 
in the monomeric compositions. E.g. useful polytelomers for adhesives 
formulations are obtained when monomeric compositions that 
yield polymers with glass transition temperatures below about 25째C 
are used in the polymeric stage, and monomeric compositions that 
yield telomers with glass transition temperatures above 
-10 째C in the telomeric stage. In particular this invention relates to the polytelomerizations 
that are conducted in aqueous emulsions of substantially water 
insoluble monomers, incorporating emulsifiers and other additives 
as is commonly practiced in the art of emulsion polymerization, 
and which is described in the book by D.C. Blackley: Emulsion 
Polymerization, Applied Science Publishers, London, 1975. More  
 
particularly still, the present

<CLAIMS>
An aqueous polymer dispersion obtainable by free-radical 
aqueous emulsion polymerization of at least two batches A and 

B, with the proviso that: 

the free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerization of the 
two batches A and B takes place in one polymerization 

vessel, 
the polymerization of batch A commences at a different 
point in time to that of batch B, 
the composition of monomers and chain transfer agent of 
batch A contains 0-3% by weight of chain transfer agent 

and the composition of monomers and chain transfer agent 
of batch B contains more chain transfer agents than 

batch A, with the proviso that the amount of chain 
transfer agent in batch B is at least 5% by weight if the 

total amount of chain transfer agent in A and in B is 
less than 2.5% by weight of the total composition of 

monomers and chain transfer agents of batch A and B, or

agent are at least partially continuously added to the 
polymerization vessel, 
batch A contains 85 - 50% by weight butadiene, 15 - 50% 
by weight styrene and 0 - 20% by weight carboxylic acids 

or non acidic polar monomers and 
the monomer composition of batches A and B are such that 
the glass transition temperature resulting from the application 

of the Fox equation to the monomer composition 
of batch A is at least about 5째C different from the glass 

transition temperature resulting from the application of 
the Fox equation to the monomer composition of batch B.
