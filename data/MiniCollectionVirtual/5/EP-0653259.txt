<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for setting blind rivets and blind rivet nuts and of a setting apparatus, in which a tensile force is produced during a setting operation with the aid of an electric motor (3). During this process, the rivetting or setting operation is to be monitored without the need for additional mechanical components. For the purpose of monitoring the operation, the input current of the motor (3) is monitored with the aid of a circuit device which has a current-measuring device (8) that monitors the power consumption of the motor and is connected to an evaluation device (10).

Method for setting blind rivets and blind rivet nuts 
in which, in a setting process, a traction force is 

produced with the aid of an electric motor, 
characterised in that a desired current range for 

the input current is selected as a function of the 
material and dimensions of the blind rivet or of the 

blind rivet nut and there is monitoring of whether 
the actual input current reaches a maximum value 

during the setting process which lies in this 
desired current range. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the desired current range is compensated for 

temperature and/or input voltage. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the desired current range is determined by 

means of one or more test rivet joints under 
conditions which are comparable to those of a 

desired real rivet joint. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
in the case of the test rivet joints the current 

variation or at least one quantity derived therefrom 
is stored, this quantity being used later for 

generating the desired current range. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the current supply to the 

motor is interrupted as soon as the input current 
attains a predetermined maximum value. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the optionally temperature-compensated 

and/or voltage-compensated input current 
variations or quantities derived therefrom from 

successive setting processes are stored.  
 
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the input current characteristic or the quantities 

derived therefrom are classified, wherein only the 
numbers of occurrences per class are stored. 
Setting device for blind rivets and blind rivet nuts 
for carrying out the method according to one of 

Claims 1 to 7 having a traction mechanism driven by 
an electric motor, characterised in that a circuit 

device is provided which has a current measuring 
device (8) monitoring the current consumption of the 

motor (3) and connected to an evaluation device 
(10), wherein the evaluation device has a comparator 

(10). 
Setting device according to Claim 8, characterised 
in that the comparator (10) is connected to a 

threshold value pick-up (11, 12) which issues one of 
at least two externally preselectable threshold 

values. 
Setting device according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that a motor temperature measuring device (14) 

and/or a motor voltage meter (15) are provided which 
are connected to the threshold value pick-up (11, 

12), wherein the threshold value pick-up (11, 12) 
changes the preselectable threshold value as a 

function of the motor temperature (T) and/or the 
motor input voltage (U). 
Setting device according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in that the threshold value pick-up 

(11, 12) has a memory device (12) in which various 
threshold values are stored. 
Setting device according to Claim 11, characterised 
in that the memory device (12) is connected to a 

read-in device (20, 21) which has a peak current  
 

meter (8, 20), an intermediate memory (20) for 
depositing several peak current values and a 

calculating device (21) for determining a mean value 
and/or a tolerance band from the stored peak current 

values. 
Setting device according to one of Claims 8 to 12, 
characterised in that the comparator (10) is 

constructed as a window comparator. 
Setting device according to one of Claims 8 to 13, 
characterised in that a position sensor (16) for the 

traction mechanism (1) is provided which is 
connected to the evaluation device (10). 
Setting device according to Claim 14, characterised 
in that the position sensor (16) is constructed as a 

limit switch.
