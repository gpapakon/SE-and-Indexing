<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission
comprising a hydraulic pump connected to the crankshaft
of an engine, a hydraulic motor having a motor output
shaft coaxial with the hydraulic pump and connected to
the hydraulic pump by a closed circuit, and a static,
hydraulic continuously-variable-speed transmission
mechanism contained in a casing with its axis in
parallel to the crankshaft. A transmission similar to this transmission is
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open
(Kokai) No. 4-203554.In the transmission disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-open (Kokai) No. 4-203554, the output shaft of a
hydraulic motor included in a static, hydraulic
continuously-variable-speed transmission mechanism
serves as the output shaft of the transmission.
Therefore, the static, hydraulic continuously-variable-speed
transmission mechanism must have a large torque
capacity to provide the transmission with a large
transmission gear ratio and, consequently, the static,
hydraulic continuously-variable-speed transmission
mechanism inevitably has a large size. If the
transmission is provided with a static, hydraulic
continuously-variable-speed transmission having a small
torque capacity, the transmission gear ratio of the
transmission is variable in a narrow range of
transmission gear ratio. EP-A-323 633, in the embodiment of Figs. 20 and 21, discloses a
transmission according to the preamble part of claim 1. There the electric
motor and the generator are disposed at opposite ends of the unitary
combined engine and transmission mechanism and therefore have to be sealed
separately in a water-proof manner.It is an object of the invention to provide a hydrostatic continuously-variable-speed
transmission wherein water-proof sealing can be achieved in a
more simple manner.The object is achieved by a transmission comprising: a hydraulic pump
drivingly connected to a crankshaft of an engine; a hydraulic motor having a
motor output shaft coaxial with the axis of rotation of the hydraulic pump and
connected to the hydraulic pump by a closed circuit so as to form a
hydrostatic continuously-variable-speed transmission mechanism; a casing
containing said hydrostatic continuously-variable-speed transmission
mechanism; an output shaft of the transmission being supported for rotation
on the casing in parallel to the axis of the hydrostatic continuously-variable-speed
transmission mechanism, the motor output shaft and the output shaft
being interconnected by a reduction mechanism, a generator connected to one
end of the
