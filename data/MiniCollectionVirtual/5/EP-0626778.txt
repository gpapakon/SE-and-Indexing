<ABSTRACT>
A method and associated apparatus for enhancing the 
display or print of greys in a two-tone digitised image 

consisting of storing a portion of a binary image map 
including a central bit under examination to be displayed 

and in testing if the said central bit is representative 
of an isolated dot or whether in a region around the said 

central bit in one of a plurality of predetermined 
directions there is an isolated dot at a predetermined 

distance from the said central bit, to display the 
central bit as a dot of reduced dimensions in such a way 

as to convert the display of an isolated dot in the 
display into a plurality of smaller dots with aggregate 

areas equivalent to the isolated dot and distributed 
around the location of the isolated dot identified from 

the image map.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for improving the representation of greys in a digitised 
image. It is known that any image can be represented and 
described as a matrix of elementary areas or pixels, to 
each of which is assigned one of two tones, black and 
white respectively, to which is associated one of two 
logic or electrical levels. In this case each pixel is described and can be 
represented by a single bit of information. The pixel can easily be displayed with high contrast 
display devices and processes (on screen or by printing). This method of description and generation of images also 
lends itself, as is known, to describing and displaying 
images having several tone levels or greys, obtained not 
by modulation of the optical density of the image dots, 
but by local variation of the ratio between light and 
dark areas.  Below a threshold size the human eye integrates the 
perception of separate areas in view into a single area 
of uniform intermediate tone. Although it is today possible, with high contrast display 
devices and processes to vary within the ambit of one 
image pixel the width of the dot represented, either 
black on white or white on black, and therefore modulate, 
pixel by pixel, the ratio between the black and white 
areas and thus the apparent grey level, this involves the 
necessity of using more information bits at the digital 
image description level to describe the state of each 
individual pixel. For example, with two bits a pixel can be described as 
white, black or characterised by two different dimensions 
and therefore two apparent separate grey levels. With 3 bits the possible number of tones rises to 8 
(black and white included), with 4 bits to 16 and with 5 
bits to 32. Since digital display devices presuppose a digital 
description of the image stored on a physical support of 
optical, magnetic or electronic type, that is to say in 
a "memory", it is evident that a considerable increase in 
the memory capacity is required to describe a digitised  
 
image with a predetermined resolution, for example of 300 
x 300 dpi (dots per inch) if each dot has to have 
information on the grey level associated with it. To overcome this disadvantage software digital processing 
techniques have been known for some time, known as 
methods of "dithering" which, given a certain image 
resolution, take into consideration a 
plurality of contiguous pixels generally organised in a 
square matrix, defined as a superpixel, (not necessarily 
with sides

A method for enhancing the display of greys in a 
two-tone digitised imagine comprising steps of: 


a) generating a binary signal having first and 
second logic leve
ls representative of at least one image 
map of a desired image having more than two tones; 
b) storing in a temporary memory N consecutive 
bits in M consecutive rows of the said image map forming 

a subgroup of the said image map, 
c) extracting from the said temporary memory a 
plurality of the said bits forming a scanning window 

comprising a central bit and a predetermined number of

d) identifying, via the bits of the said window an 
isolated image bit with the said first logic level, 

surrounded by bits at the said second logic level, at a 
distance from other bits of the said window at the said 

first logic level greater than two bits, and satisfying 
one of the following conditions: 


the said isolated bit coincides with the said 
central bit, 
the said central bit is at the said second logic 
level and the said isolated bit is located at a 

predetermined distance from the said central bit in one 
of a plurality of pre-determined directions in the said
