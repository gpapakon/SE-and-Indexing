<ABSTRACT>
High yields of vanadium containing virtually no nickel or 
magnesium are obtained from natural bitumen ash consisting of up to 

5% carbon, more than 95% of water-soluble compounds of vanadium, 
nickel and magnesium by mixing the ash with water to produce a 20% 

solids slurry of pH below 6.5 and temperature of 80-85° C oxidizing 
any reduced vanadium in the slurry and then separating and removing 

the resulting polyvanadate precipitate from the liquid phase 
containing substantially all the nickel and magnesium values of the 

ash.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the hydrometallurgical
art, and is more particularly concerned with a novel method of
separating vanadium values from ORIMULSION® natural bitumen ash in high yields
and substantially free from nickel and magnesium values in the ash.As has been long known, vanadium-containing fuel oil ashes can
be treated with mineral acid to dissolve the vanadium.
(See e.g. US-A-4 788 044 where the residues from the combustion of
petroleum fractions, such as ash and soot, are leached with
aqueous H2SO4 to extract vanadium.). Recovery is
improved by adding a reducing agent to the leach solution prior to
filtering to remove the ash residue from the acidic leach liquor.
But this procedure is useful to advantage only if the vanadium
recovery need not be so high that other metal values in the ash
such as nickel and magnesium interfere with vanadium separation,
making more complex and expensive vanadium separation steps
necessary.Another procedure for recovering vanadium from such ash
containing 10 to 80% carbon involves selectively dissolving the
vanadium in a caustic soda solution. An oxidizing agent is used in
sufficient quantities to oxidize the vanadium as reduced vanadium
is difficult to dissolve under alkaline conditions. The nickel and
magnesium are left behind in the ash residue as vanadium is removed
from the solution by solvent extraction, ion exchange or
precipitation. But when the ash is that of natural bitumen and
contains 10% or more of magnesium as the sulfate, for example, 
reagent consumption must be high in order to obtain soluble
vanadium recoveries as high as 80-90%. Additionally, leaching at
high base concentration is required for efficient reaction rate and
further significantly increases the cost of the alkali leach
process.It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved method of
recovering vanadium values from ORIMULSION natural bitumen ash.This object according to the invention is accomplished by means of the
method of claim 1.Thus, in accordance with this invention, based upon our discovery
and novel concepts, it is possible to recover
vanadium in very high yields from ORIMULSION natural bitumen ash in condition
of purity amenable to furnacing or conventional vanadium recovery.
Moreover, nickel and magnesium values can also be recovered in high
yields and virtually free from vanadium and each other. Further,
these new results can be obtained economically and without complex
processing or high capital cost.We have found that ORIMULSION natural

magnesium values which comprises the steps of slurrying

the ash with water, then adding oxidizing agent and
sulfuric acid to maintain the resulting slurry at a pH

of between 2 and 3, thereafter agitating the said slurry
for 1 to 24 hours at temperatures between 20°C and

100°C, and then separating and removing the solid phase

The method of claim 1 including the steps of leaching
substantially all the vanadium from the solid phase by

contacting the solid phase with aqueous alkali solution.
The method of claim 4 wherein the steps of leaching
substantially all the vanadium values from the solid

phase is carried out after separating and removing the
solid phase from the liquid phase containing the nickel

and magnesium values.
