<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a dismountable container, in which firstly an essentially hollow-cylindrical body part is formed from a first material, in particular cardboard or plastic material, the body part (12) is sealed at one end face with a first covering forming a bottom, the part-container consisting of the body part and the first covering is filled with a filler material, and the body part is finally sealed tightly at its end face, facing away from the first covering, with a second covering (14) forming a lid, the connection at least of the second covering (14) to the body part (12) being brought about by producing a folded sealing edge, consisting both of the first material and of the material of the (relevant) covering, by means of a fold sealing machine having a leading roll and a trailing roll (20), and at least one separation line (12c), which forms a closed circle and is concentrical to the longitudinal axis of the container, being applied directly adjacent to the folded sealing edge. The manufacturing method is characterised in that at least the second covering (14) is formed from a second material, in particular sheet metal, which differs from the first material, and in that the separating line(s) (12c) is/are made by (a) cutting device(s) (30), adjacent to the leading and/or trailing roll (20) of the fold sealing machine as line(s) of weakness (12c) which do(es) not pass right through the material of the body part (12) or of the (relevant) covering(s).

A method of manufacturing a dismountable container 
(10), wherein a substantially hollow cylindrical body 

part (12) is first made from a first material, more 
particularly cardboard or plastics, an end of the body 

part (12) is closed by a first cover forming a base, a 
filling material is poured into the partial container 

consisting of the body part and the first cover, and 
finally the end of the body part (12) remote from the 

first cover is sealed with a second cover (14) forming 
a lid, the join between at least the second cover and 

the body part being made by producing a folded seam 
closure edge consisting both of the first material and 

of the material of the cover (14), using a folded seam 
jointing machine comprising a front roller and a back 

roller (20), and at least one closed circular parting 
line (12c) concentric with the longitudinal axis of the 

container is made in the immediate neighbourhood of the 
folded seam closure edge, characterised in that at 

least the second cover is made of a second material, 
more particularly sheet metal, different from the first 

material, and in that the parting line or lines (12c) 
are made in the same working step as the production of 

the folded seam closure edge, by one or more cutting 
devices (30) adjacent the front and/or back roller (20)
 
of the folded seam jointing machine and are in the form 

of a weakening line or lines (12c) which do not extend 
through the material of the body part or the associated 

cover or covers.  
 
A method according to claim 1, characterised by 
use of a cutting device adjacent the back roller (20) 

of the folded seam jointing machine. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
by use of a cutting device (30) adjacent the front 

roller of the folded seam jointing machine. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by use of one or more cutting devices 

(30) firmly connected to the folded seam jointing 
machine. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a weakening line (12c) is formed 

in the body part near the folded seam closure edge of 
the second cover (14). 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a weakening line (12c) is formed 

in the lid of the second cover (14) near the folded 
seam closure edge. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a weakening line (12c) is formed 

in the body part (12) near the folded seam closure edge 
of the first cover. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a weakening line (12c) is formed 

in the bottom of the first cover near the folded seam 
closure edge of the first cover.  

 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by use of a cutting device (30) 

comprising at least one cutting edge. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by use of a cutting device (30) having a 

cutting edge in the form of toothed profiles. 
A method according to claim 9, characterised by 
use of a cutting device (30) having a cutting edge in 

the form of at least one knife blade. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by use of a cutting device (30) 

comprising adjustable knife blades. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by use of a cutting device (30) in the 

form of a trailing knife. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised by use of a cutting device (30) in the 

form of a revolving knife. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that at least one weakening line (12c) 

is formed by a grooving device.
