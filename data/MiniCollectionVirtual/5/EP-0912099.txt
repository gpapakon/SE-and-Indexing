<ABSTRACT>
A cake mould (1) is described, which is suitable for containing a substance to be baked. This cake mould comprises at least a bottom plate (3) and a wall (2) positioned basically perpendicular to the bottom, the wall being detachable from the bottom plate. In addition, wall (2) is flexible and is combined with the bottom plate by means of fastening organs, which include first fastening organs (6) which are shaped according to a pattern in bottom plate (3), as well as second fastening organs (4), which are part of wall (2). When the fastening organs cooperate mutually, the shape of wall (2) basically matches the pattern of the first fastening organs (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
Cake MouldThe present invention concerns a cake mould, which is suitable for containing a substance to be baked, at least comprising a bottom plate and a wall positioned basically perpendicular to the bottom plate, the wall being detachable from the bottom plate.Cake moulds with a detachable wall are commonly known. One could, for example, think of a springfoim pan, as described, for example, in the German 'Gebrauchsmuster', no. 92 17 802.2, which has a round bottom plate surrounded by a ringform wall which is detachable and clamped around the bottom by means of a suitable clamp. The inside of the wall is commonly equipped with a groove which allows the ridge of the bottom plate.These type of cake moulds commonly have a fixed, mostly round shape, whereas the present invention aims at providing a cake mould according to the one referred to at the beginning, which need not necessarily have a round shape, yet can have various shapes. Although these type of 'fantasy' cake moulds are already known, they only involve cake moulds with a bottom plate and the wall made of one piece.The present cake mould referred to at the beginning is characterised in that the wall is flexible and is attached to the bottom plate by means of fastening organs, said fastening organs comrising first fastening organs which are provided at the bottom plate according to a pattern, as well as second fastening organs which are provided at the wall, and in that by mutual cooperation of fastening organs it is basically the wall that follows the pattern of the first fastening organs.The bottom plate contains the first fastening organs, which are provided in the bottom plate according to a certain pattern. The wall is flexible and, if not combined, it is primarily straight. In addition to this, the wall is provided with the second fastening organs which can cooperate with the first fastening organs. 

When attaching the first fastening organs to the second fastening organs, the wall will be bent and shaped according to the pattern of the first fastening organs. The pattern of the first fastening organs thus determines the final shape of the cake mould. Since the wall is commonly straight if not combined, yet can take any shape, it is the same for every desired shape. Subsequently, by providing different bottom plates with different patterns of the first fastening organs, cake mould bottoms of different shapes are possible due to the flexible wall. In practice, this means that the cake mould can be supplied by means of one or more bottom
