<DESCRIPTION>
 TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION CIRCUITRY EMPLOYING A SINGLE TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION ELEMENT This invention relates, generally to the field of temperature compensation circuitry, and more particularly, to an improved temperature compensation circuit employing a single temperature compensation element which is used to compensate for the effects of temperature on both the signal gain and offset of a sensor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the fields of process parameter measurement and process control, it is frequently desirable to employ and/or locate sensors at stages or steps of a processing chain for the purpose of measuring process variables at that particular stage or step. Many different types of sensors may be utilized to measure many different process control variables such as temperature and pressure. Some examples of common sensors include strain sensors for measuring torque and pressure, and mass flow controllers which are used to measure and control the flow of gas through a tube. In the electronics industry, such mass flow controllers are often used in the fields of semiconductor processing and fabrication where it is necessary to accurately and precisely measure the temperature and pressure of a gas or other chemical agent at individual points in the processing path. An example of a sensor used with a mass flow controller can be found in U.S. Patent 4,464,932 issued to MKS Instruments, Inc. of Andover, Massachusetts, the present assignee. This patent illustrates an improved mass flow controller which incorporates a number of sensors for measuring the temperature and flow of a gas. While such measurement techniques are well known, it is also well known that ambient temperature may affect the sensitivity and gain of such sensors, and may further superimpose an undesirable offset on the output of such sensors. Therefore, when designing electronic circuitry that is used to interface a sensor for the purpose of measuring some physical parameter with that sensor, it has been a common practice to correct for the effects of temperature on the sensor, or the effects of temperature on the associated sensor circuitry, by adding elements with known repeatable temperature coefficients in such a way as to null the thermal effects on the sensor and its circuitry. An example of this practice has been to include in the sensor signal output path a temperature compensation element such as a resistor with known and repeatable temperature coefficients (like a thermistor), incorporated in such a way as to change the
