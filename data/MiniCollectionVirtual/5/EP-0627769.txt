<ABSTRACT>
A resonant tunneling diode (30,40,50) having a quantum 
well (32,42,52) sandwiched between first and second tunnel 

barrier layers (33,34; 43,44; 53,54) and the quantum well 
and tunnel barrier layers sandwiched between an injection 

layer (36,46,56) and a collector layer (38,48,58). The 
improvement includes a relatively thin layer (35,49,55,59) 

of semiconductor material sandwiched between either the 
first tunnel barrier layer (33,43,53) and the injection 

layer (36,46,56) and/or the first tunnel barrier layer 
(33,43,53) and the quantum well (32,42,52). The thin 

semiconductor layer (35,49,55,59) has a valence band with an 
energy level lower than the valence band of the first tunnel 

barrier layer (33,43,53) so as to prevent minority carriers 
from travelling toward the injection layer (38,48,58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to resonant tunneling
diodes and more specifically to resonant interband tunneling diodes
with reduced valley current.In resonant tunneling diodes, the valley current is a
leakage current that degrades performance. It is believed
that the valley or leakage current has several origins, such
as conduction through defects in the barrier, phonon
assisted tunneling, thermally excited tunneling, hole
conduction and others. Generally, a resonant tunneling
diode, of the double barrier type, includes an injection
layer, a first tunneling barrier layer, a quantum well, a
second tunneling barrier layer and a collector layer all
sandwiched together in the listed order. In an InAs-AlSb-GaSb-AlSb-InAs
double barrier diode, for example, the
electron confinement is good while hole confinement is poor. Such a resonant interband tunneling diode is known from US-A-5 113 231.With bias applied to the double barrier diode, normal
current flows in the following manner. When the bias is
sufficient to approximately align the ground state for holes
in the quantum well with electrons in the conduction band of
the injection layer, resonant tunneling occurs. That is,
resonant tunneling occurs when one of the electron bands in
the injection layer has the same energy as the ground state
for holes in the quantum well. Then an electron from the
filled ground state can transfer to the collector layer and
an electron from the injection layer can replace the
transferred electron. Valley current occurs if the hole that is created in
the quantum well moves to the negative terminal, the
injection layer in this example. Further, as the bias
increases, the barrier to holes decreases in height and
thickness and valley current increases even more.It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a
new and improved resonant tunneling diode with reduced
valley current.It is a further purpose of the present invention to
provide a new and improved resonant tunneling diode with
reduced valley current by introducing a complex band edge to
extend the effective barrier into the valence band.The above problems are solved and the above
purposes are realized in a resonant interband tunneling
diode as featured in claim 1.Referring to the drawings:
FIG.1 illustrates a typical energy level diagram for a
double barrier, resonant tunneling diode;FIG.2 illustrates the energy level diagram of FIG. 1
with a bias applied thereto; FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 illustrate three embodiments of a
double barrier, resonant tunneling diode embodying
