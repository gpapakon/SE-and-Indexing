<ABSTRACT>
Isoparaffins and olefins are alkylated by contact with a solid 
superacid such as sulfated zirconia optionally containing added metals, 

and containing added heteropolyacids (HPA's) or polyoxoanions (POA's). 
The presence of HPA's or POA's in the solid superacid catalyst results 

in higher yields of desired high-octane components in the product 
mixture than are obtained in the absence of HPA's or POA's.

<DESCRIPTION>
The reaction of isobutane with low (C2-C5) molecular weight 
olefins to produce C6-C9 paraffins is commonly referred to as 
alkylation. In commercial practice this reaction is carried out in the 
presence of acid type catalysts such as concentrated sulfuric acid or 
HF. The reaction is an important process to the petroleum industry as it 
upgrades chemical compounds in crude oil for which there may be little 
value to high octane fuel components. The two acids mentioned above 
are the catalysts of choice as the process is now practiced 
commercially, but each of them while producing a satisfactory alkylate 
for fuel blending has serious drawbacks. The use of HF presents a 
significant ecological hazard should it escape into the atmosphere, and 
the sulfuric acid process is very corrosive and energy consuming as it 
needs to be operated at below ambient temperatures in order to provide a 
satisfactory alkylate. Certain solid compositions with acidic 
properties have been found to catalyze this reaction as subsequently 
disclosed. Solid superacid catalysts have been proposed for use as alkylation 
catalysts. See for example Hollstein et al U. S. Patents Nos. 4,918,041 
and 4,956,519 issued April 17, 1990 and September 11, 1990 respectively, 
disclosing solid superacid catalysts useful in alkylation and other 
reactions comprising a sulfated calcined metal oxide or hydroxide of 
Group III or Group IV, e.g. zirconium; metal oxide or hydroxide of Group 
V, Group VI or Group VII, e.g. manganese; 3 0 and a metal oxide or 
hydroxide of Group VIII, e.g. iron. See also Angstadt et al U. S.  
 
Patent 5,212,136 issued May 18, 1993, disclosing solid superacid 
catalysts useful as alkylation catalysts comprising sulfated and 
calcined mixtures of a support comprising an oxide or hydroxide of a 
Group IV-A element, an oxide or hydroxide of molybdenum and an oxide or 
hydroxide of a Group I-B, II-B, III-A, III-D, IV-B, V-A or VI-A metal 
other than molybdenum, or a metal of the Lanthanide Series of the 
Periodic Table. See also Angstadt et al U.S. Patent 5,214,017 issued 
May 25, 1993, disclosing solid superacid catalysts useful as alkylation 
catalysts, comprising sulfated and calcined mixtures of a support 
comprising an oxide or hydroxide of a Group IV-A element, an oxide or 
hydroxide of a Group VI, VII or VIII metal, an oxide or hydroxide of a 
Group I-B, II-B, III-A, III-B, IV-B, V-A or VI-A metal and an oxide or 
hydroxide of a metal of the Lanthanide Series of the Periodic Table.
