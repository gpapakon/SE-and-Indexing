<ABSTRACT>
A workpiece holder for angularly reciprocatory friction 
welding apparatus includes clamp members for clamping the 

workpiece to a mounting table. The height and 
circumferential position of a drum is adjustable to 

facilitate blade attachment in manufacture of a blum. 
Means are also described for reinforcing the drum during 

blade attachment in order to absorb welding forces which 
might otherwise distort the drum surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to to 
friction welding. It has been known for many years that two components, 
even metal components can be welded together by 
reciprocating at least one of the components and urging 
the components together, the frictional heat generated 
between the components melting the material of at least 
one component, and more usually both components, so as to 
form a friction weld. One example of a technical field 
in which friction welding is currently seen as having 
useful applications is in the field of making compressors 
or turbines for aircraft engines. Compressor assemblies 
may comprise a blisk (blades plus integral disc), or a 
blum (blades plus integral drum) which is effectively 
several blisks joined together. A friction welding machine adapted for joining circular 
workpieces such as shafts, rings and the like to very 
close concentricity tolerances is described in US Patent 
No 4,033,501. The machine has a unitised headstock and 
tailstock assembly in which the headstock is rotatably 
and slidably disposed within a rigid tailstock. The two 
annular parts to be joined by friction welding are 
mounted one within a hollow headstock and the other 
within a hollow tailstock with the whole assembly being 
concentric about a common axis. The annular parts are 
held firmly in place within the headstock and tailstock 
as appropriate by radially gripping collet chuck jaws. 
In the welding operation itself the two parts are brought 
together in end-to-end abutment and one is spun rapidly 
relative to the other to create an annular abutment weld.  
 The process maybe used to join several rotor discs to 
form a multi-stage drum to which radial blades can be 
subsequently joined to create blums (bladed drums). 
However, the described welding machine totally encircles 
the workpieces rendering their circumferences 
inaccessible for the welding-on of these blades. The 
problem of clamping the drum for the later joining of 
blades to its circumference is not addressed. According to a first aspect of the invention we provide a 
workpiece holder for holding an annular workpiece (90) 
during a friction welding operation comprising a first 
drum-like clamp member (95) the interior of which defines 
a chamber or recess for receiving the workpiece (90) and 
which is adapted to engage one end thereof, characterised 
in that there is provided a second clamp member (101) to 
engage an opposite end of the annular workpiece (90) and 
clamp force means (100) operative to urge the first and 
second

A workpiece holder for holding an annular workpiece 
(90) during a friction welding operation comprises a 

first drum-like clamp member (95) the interior of 
which defines a chamber or recess for receiving the 

workpiece (90) and which is adapted to engage one 
end thereof,
 
characterised in that
 
there is provided a second clamp member (101) to 

engage an opposite end of the annular workpiece (90) 
and clamp force means (100) operative to urge the 

first and second clamp members (95,101) towards each 
other to frictionally engage opposite ends of the 

workpiece (90), and wherein the drum-like clamp 
member (95) has a base (99) to engage and support 

the workpiece (90) at a height within the chamber 
such that a welding location(92) on the 

circumference of the workpiece (90) to which 
radially extending components (91) are to be welded 

is accessible between the clamp members (95,101).

workpiece (90) internally thereof. 
A workpiece holder as claimed in claim 9 adapted to 
reinforce a workpiece (90) consisting of a generally 

cylindrical exterior having at least one internal 
annulus (131) co-axial with the cylindrical 

exterior, comprises a reinforcing diaphragm adapted  
 

to engage said at least one annulus (131) and to
