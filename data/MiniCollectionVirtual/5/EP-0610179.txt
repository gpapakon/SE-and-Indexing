<ABSTRACT>
A soluble antibody conjugate comprising an antibody linked to a structure which is recognizable by T-cells and has the ability to direct T-cells to lyse the target cell, which is recognized by the antibody. The conjugate is characterized by the structure being a superantigen. One important mode is a method for the lysis of target cells, wherein the target cells are contacted with a target cell lysis effective amount of the conjugate. The method of lysis is part of a potent treatment regimen for cancer, autoimmunity, parasitic infestations and fungal, viral and bacterial infections. The specification also describes modes such as the synthesis of the conjugate and pharmaceutical compositions and their manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns antibody conjugates which 
are capable of activating cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). The 
conjugates are useful for destroying undesired cells that are 
associated with i.a. cancer forms, autoimmune processes, 
parasitic infestations and bacterial, viral and fungal 
infections. Attempts have been made over the past years to use 
antibodies in combination with agents that directly exert a 
toxic effect on target cells (cytotoxic agents, cytotoxins) 
in order to provide a selective action on target cells and to 
prevent and minimize the non-specific effect on other cells. 
The combinations suggested have ranged from covalently bonded 
complexes using linkage-providing molecules and non-covalently 
bonded complexes to simple mixings (e.g. Ghose et 
al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 61(1979)657-676 and Carlsson et 
al., Biotechnology 7(1989)567-73). Suggested cytotoxins have 
been i.a. diphteria toxin, ricin, subunit A of ricin, 
gelonin, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (Takeda 
Chemical Ind., EP-A-336,405 and Pastan et al., WO-A-88/00703, 
and US-A-4,545,985 and Neorx, EP-A-306,943). With the advent of the hybridoma technology and the 
accompanying availability of monoclonal antibodies, it has 
been feasible to use the concept of complexes between 
antibodies and cytotoxic agents to more specifically direct 
the cytotoxic agents to the intended target cell population. In view of the recognized damaging effect of cytotoxic 
agents on other cells than target cells, one has suggested to 
replace the cytotoxic agents with immune stimulators that 
trigger T-lymphocytes and activate CTLs. Specific proposals 
have been concerned with antibodies conjugated to  
 
(i) antibodies that are directed against a T-cell receptor 
or compounds that are able to bind to a T-cell receptor 
(Mass. Inst. Techn., EP-A1-180,171); (ii) compounds, such as antigens, mitogens, other foreign 
proteins, and peptides that activate cytotoxic T-cells 
(Neorex Corp., EP-A1-334,300); (iii) MHC antigens, (Behringwerke AG, EP-A1-352,761); (iv) antigens against which the individual to be treated 
has immunity, (Med. Res. Counc. WO-A-90/11779 (publ. 1990-10-18)); 
and (v) an unnamed bacterial enterotoxin (Ochi and Wake, UCLA-Symposium: 
Cellular Immunity and the Immunotherapy of 
Cancers, January 27-February 3, 1990, Abstract CE 515. page 
109). However, the immune stimulators suggested hitherto have 
been either too specific or too general in their action. For 
instance classical antigens activate only about 1 out of
