<ABSTRACT>
A material delivery system using buckets suspended from a driven chain is 
capable of being driven in a first and a subsequent second direction. Further, the 

buckets in the system have interacting edges that close the gap between buckets when 
the buckets are urged to do so by cam elements integral with the buckets interfacing 

with cam actuation elements positioned adjacent the buckets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention has to do with distribution systems for distributing bulk
flowable materials by means of a bucket style conveying system. More specifically a
means for determining the quantity of material in a bucket is incorporated in a control
system which will direct a controlled vibratory feeder to fill a particular bucket with
an amount of bulk flowable material necessary to fill or otherwise load a bucket with
a quantity of material.It is known to have bucket conveying systems that are used to transport
flowable bulk materials. Buckets are filled at a filling or loading station and then
unloaded at a packaging or processing station. Systems are also known wherein
buckets can be circulated through the system and returned to the filling station
without having been dumped. In such situations it is necessary to move the bucket
through the filling station without the bucket being overfilled by filling with more
than the quantity necessary to fill the empty, partially full or fully filled bucket.An alternative system is known from US-A-4 892 179, in which a
proximity sensor, an encoder, and tripper switches at feed and unloading
zones are used by a central controller to keep track of bucket
position and fill status (empty, half-full, full). Further US-A-4 580 698
and DE-A-3 521 657 show continuous self-regulation of metering using
feedback schemes.The invention is defined in claims 1 and 4. According to an embodiment of the present invention a bucket conveyor distribution system,
primarily for use in food packaging processes, includes control elements in the in-feed
zone that will determine the fill level of individual buckets as they approach the
in-feed station and regulate the amount of product being fed into a particular bucket
depending on and responsive to packaging system demands of a downstream
processing station.The system is self-regulating based on volumetric demands responsive to
packaging station's processing and consumption of product served to the packaging
stations by the bucket conveyor system.One advantage of the system is that an operator is not required to adjust the
in-feed volume being loaded into the conveyor buckets. The status; empty, full, or
partially full; of each bucket is sensed dynamically and the response of the in-feed
filling apparatus is generated without operator adjustment.Another advantage of the invention is that varying discharge demands, each
with varying volume demands, may be accommodated by the system with no in-feed
calibration required by operating

<CLAIMS>
A bulk material handling conveyor system (10) having a set of buckets (26)
transportably carried in a continuous manner from an infeed zone where said buckets

are filled with product by means of a metering vibratory feeder (14) having a product
outlet to an unloading zone and back to the infeed zone, said buckets capable of being

selectively at least partially emptied in said unloading zone further
comprising:


a proximity trigger (54) for sensing the presence of a bucket;
a processing unit (66) electrically connected to said proximity trigger for
receiving and storing the output of said proximity trigger;
a fill determining sensor (50) mounted proximate to said buckets between
said unloading zone and said metering vibratory feeder, said fill determining

sensor for determining the fill status of each bucket and being electrically connected to said processing unit whereby said processor (66)
receives and stores the fill status of said buckets prior to said buckets traveling

in said conveyor system to said metering vibratory conveyor;
a feeder control (72) electrically connected to said processor for cycling
said metering vibratory feeder on and off responsive to signals from said

processor, said processor signaling said feeder control to cycle on when a
bucket of said set of buckets having been sensed by said fill determining

sensor to be less than full is proximate the outlet of said metering vibratory
feeder.
The invention in accordance with Claim 1 wherein said proximity
trigger is mounted proximate a bucket location at the product outlet of said metering

vibratory feeder.
The invention in accordance with Claim 2 wherein said fill
determining sensor is capable of discriminating between an empty bucket and a full

bucket and any fill status between these two conditions.
In a bucket conveyor system (10) including a set of buckets transportably
carried in a continuous manner from an infeed zone where said buckets may be filled

with product by means of a metering vibratory feeder (14) to an unloading zone where
said buckets may be unloaded and back to the infeed zone, a proximity trigger (54)

mounted proximate to said set of buckets, a fill determining sensor (50) mounted
proximate to said set of buckets for sensing the amount of product in each of said

buckets (26) of said set
and a processor (66) for receiving signals from said proximity trigger and said fill

determining sensor, a method of determining the fill status of each bucket and filling 
each bucket responsive to its fill status comprising the steps of:


determining the presence of a bucket at a particular location in the belt
conveyor system by means of said proximity trigger;
storing the occurrence of the presence of a bucket determined by said
proximity trigger in said processing unit;
determining the fill status of a bucket at the time said proximity
trigger is triggered by the presence of a bucket;
actuating said metering vibratory feeder by means of said processor
sending a signal to a feeder control (72) for controlling said metering vibratory

feeder at the time when said proximity trigger is triggered by the presence of
a bucket in order to fill a bucket previously determined to be less than full.
The invention in accordance with Claim 4 wherein said processor
stores the fill status data until such time as said bucket having that particular fill

status is proximate the outlet of said metering vibratory feeder.
