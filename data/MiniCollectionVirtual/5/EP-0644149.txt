<ABSTRACT>
An escalator handrail drive system includes a 
powered drive belt (8) which engages the underneath 

surface of the handrail (2) along the return path of 
travel of the latter. A series of pressure rollers (74) 

engage the outer surface of the handrail to press the 
latter against the drive belt. The pressure rollers are 

all biased against the handrail by a single spring (60). 
The drive belt is pretensioned by an adjustable 

pretension spring assembly (40-48) which can apply a 
fixed pretensioning force-to the drive belt which will 

not substantially change irrespective of whether the 
handrail is being driven in the "up" direction or in the 

"down" direction on the escalator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a handrail drive assembly
for use in a passenger conveyor such as an escalator,
and more particularly to a handrail drive assembly which
includes a powered drive belt to supply the motive power
to the handrail.Moving handrails on an escalator or moving walkway
are typically driven by passing the handrails through a
driving pressure nip along the return path of travel of
the handrail beneath the balustrades. The nip may be
formed by a pair of cooperating rollers, or by a driven
belt which cooperates with a plurality of backup
rollers. The nip will be powered by chains or the like
which are driven by the main drive mechanism of the
escalator. Soviet Patent No. 501286-493A, U.S. Patent
No. 4,134,883, and Austrian Patent No. 247,236 disclose
variations of the prior art drive systems described
above.U.S. Patent No. 5,117,960, granted June 2, 1992 to
H.W. Ahls, et al. discloses a handrail drive system
which uses a powered drive belt and a pressure belt to
drive the handrail along its path of travel. The drive
belt is entrained on a powered drive roller, and a free
wheeling idler roller. The idler roller is biased by a
spring to provide an adjustable tension to the drive
belt. A series of adjustable but non-biased backup
rollers provide a backing force for the drive belt which
holds the latter against the handrail between the drive
roller and the idler roller. The pressure belt is
entrained on a pair of idler rollers, one of which is
spring biased to provide pressure belt tension. A
plurality of pressure rollers are disposed between the
pressure idler rollers and are individually spring
biased against the pressure belt so as to press the 
latter against the handrail.The handrail drive system described in the
aforesaid 5,117,960 patent is serviceable, but exhibits
certain drawbacks. The use of a pressure belt requires
additional hardware to mount the pressure belt and does
not add any drive power or stability to the system. The
use of individual pressure roller springs renders the
drive assembly difficult to properly adjust. The
individual pressure springs also limit the flexibility
of the force imparted to the handrail which presses the
handrail against the drive belt. Finally, the
tensioning spring assemblies which are used to impart
tension to the drive belt and the pressure belt, and
thus reduce or eliminate belt slippage, are vulnerable
to forces which emanate from the handrail that tend to
vary the belt tension depending on whether the handrail
is being moved in the upward or

<CLAIMS>
A drive assembly of a handrail (2) on a passenger
conveyor, said drive assembly comprising:


a) a drive belt (8) engaging a first surface on the
handrail and supplying a motive force to the

handrail;
b) a powered pulley (10) engaging one end of the drive
belt, and a tension pulley assembly (12) engaging an

opposite end of the drive belt, said powered pulley
being operable to drive the drive belt through an

endless path of travel defined by the powered pulley
and the tension pulley;
c) reaction means (6) engaging a second surface on the
handrail to bias the handrail against the drive belt;
d) automatic tension adjustment means (40-48) operable to
adjust the position of said tension pulley assembly

relative to said powered pulley so as to adjust the
degree of pretension of the drive belt; and
e) means (38) associated with said tension
adjustment means and operable to prevent movement of

said tension pulley assembly toward said powered
pulley when said drive belt is moving the hand-rail

from said powered pulley toward said tension pulley
assembly thereby preserving the degree of pretension

applied to said drive belt.
The drive assembly of Claim 1 wherein said tension
adjustment means comprises a coil spring (40) engaging

said tension pulley assembly (12); a fixed stop (38)
adjacent to said coil spring; threaded means (44)

engaging said spring for varying compression of said
spring; and an adjustable stop (42) mounted on said

threaded means, said adjustable stop being movable on
said threaded means to a fixed stop-engaging position

wherein said spring is rendered noncompressible. 
The drive assembly of Claim 2, wherein said threaded
means (44) comprises a bolt adjustably mounted on a

truss member of the passenger conveyor.
The drive assembly of any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein
said reaction means (6) comprises a plurality of rollers

(74) engaging the hand-rail (2), said rollers being
mounted on a pyramidal stack of brackets (64,68,72), all

of which are biased toward the handrail by a single
spring means (60).
The drive assembly of Claim 4 wherein said rollers
(74) are associated in pairs and wherein each pair of

associated rollers is mounted on a proximal bracket (72)
in a series of the latter in said pyramidal stack, said

proximal brackets being closest to the handrail (2); and
additionally comprising medial brackets (68) adjacent to

said proximal brackets, each of said medial brackets
having proximal brackets pivotally mounted thereon; and

a distal bracket (64) furthest from the handrail, said
distal bracket having medial brackets pivotally

connected thereto, said distal bracket engaging said
single spring means (60).
A drive assembly for moving a handrail (2) on a
passenger conveyor, said drive assembly comprising:


a) a drive belt assembly (4) for engaging a first surface

handrail; and
b) reaction means (6) for engaging a second surface on the
handrail and for biasing the handrail against the drive

belt (8), said reaction means comprising a plurality of
rollers (74) for engaging the handrail, said rollers being

mounted on a pyramidal stack of brackets (64,68,72),
all of which are biased toward the drive belt by a single

associated rollers is mounted on a proximal bracket (72)
in a series of the latter in said pyramidal stack, said
