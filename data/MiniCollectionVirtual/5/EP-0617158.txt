<ABSTRACT>
A method of stabilizing a hygral expansion of a protein fiber product which comprises the steps of preparing a water-soluble 
solution by dissolving a polyoxirane derivative of PEGDE or PPGDE having a water solubility of 95 wt.% or above in a solvent 

which has a solubility parameter of 13.0-10.1 (cal/cm³)
1/2
 and a boiling point of 101-190 °C and is freely miscible with 

water, preparing a treatment solution by adding to the obtained solution an aqueous solution containing at least two catalysts 
for oxirane compounds selected from the group consisting of dicyanodiamide, hydroxy carboxylic acid salts, thiocyanic 

acid salts and L-cysteines, dipping a protein fiber product in the treatment solution followed by dehydration, cross-linking 
the dehydrated fiber product with the polyoxirane derivative by heat treating the fiber product, and removing by-products 

from the heat-treated fiber product. This method serves to stabilize a hygral expansion of a protein fiber product with more 
certainty and remove difficultly water-soluble by-products formed by the heat treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for stabilizing 
the hygral expansion behavior of protein fiber products without 
deteriorating flexible feeling. It is known that protein fiber products such as wool 
products cause a so-called hygral expansion phenomenon in which 
the length of a fiber product expands and contracts depending on 
difference in water-containing rate even when relaxation 
shrinkage is completely removed. Resulting from this phenomenon, 
there has been such an inconvenience that when the temperature 
and humidity of an atmosphere in which the protein fiber product 
is placed change, the size of the fiber product is not 
stabilized, and when the fiber product is woolen fabric, 
deficiency in quality is caused such as puckering, bubbling, non-uniform 
sizes and the like. In the prior art, in order to stabilize the hygral expansion 
behavior, the fiber product is subjected to a water repellent 
treatment, the fiber product is subjected to a water repellent 
treatment followed by a baking treatment, or the fiber product is 
subjected to a treatment using a thiol derivative followed by an 
oxidation treatment. However, the stabilization effect on the 
hygral expansion is not sufficient even by these treatment 
methods, in which there has been a room to make improvement yet. As a method for improving such a point, a method for 
stabilizing the hygral expansion behavior of high grade woolen  
 
fabric has been proposed in which ethylene glycol diglycidyl 
ether (hereinafter referred to as EGDE) or propylene glycol 
diglycidyl ether (hereinafter referred to as PGDE) is used as a 
main agent, and polyvalent carboxylic acid or its salt is used as 
a catalyst thereof (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 55-36343). In this stabilization method, the woolen fabric is immersed 
in a weakly acidic treatment solution comprising the above-mentioned 
EGDE or PGDE and the above-mentioned catalyst, 
squeezed, and preliminarily dried, followed by a heat treatment 
at 150°C, so as to suppress the behavior in which crimping of 
yarn is increased or reduced depending on a degree of hygroscopic 
absorption or evaporation of moisture. However, in the above-mentioned stabilization method, EGDE 
or PGDE is made into a water-soluble solution using a solvent of 
isopropyl alcohol having a solubility parameter of 1.15 
(cal/cm³)1/2 and a boiling point of not more than 100°C so that 
in the prepared treatment solution, a reaction amount with the 
woolen fabric is not so large, and this solvent film disappears 
upon a
