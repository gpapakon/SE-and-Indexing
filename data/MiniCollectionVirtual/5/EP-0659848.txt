<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition 
for coating materials and an antifouling coating composition 
to be used for preventing attachment of marine 
organisms to the underwater or submarine structures such 
as ships, fishing nets, drainage conduits, etc. Numerous species of marine organism, such as 
barnacle, ascidian, serpula, mussel, laver, etc., live 
in the seawater. When a structure such as a ship, 
fishing net, drainage pipe,etc., is set or placed in 
commission in or on the sea, the marine organisms cling 
to the structure and grow to give various kinds of 
damage to the structure. For instance, if the ship's 
bottom is incrusted with marine organisms, the frictional 
resistance of the seawater increases to cause a 
reduction of cruising performance of the ship, so that 
if it is tried to keep a constant cruising speed of the 
ship, its fuel consumption increases to pose a serious 
economical problem. Also, if the marine organisms cling 
to the fishing net used for ocean culture, the meshes of 
the nets would be clogged up, which could prove fatal to 
the cultured fishes and shellfishes. Hitherto, in order to prevent attachment of 
the marine organisms to the underwater structures such 
as mentioned above, antifouling paints using homopolymers  
 
or copolymers of organotin-containing unsaturated 
monomers as resinous component (see Japanese 
Patent Examined Publication (JP-B) Nos. 40-21426, 
44-9579, 46-13392, 49-20491, 51-11647, 51-12049, 
52-48170, etc.) have been applied to said structures. 
These polymers have their organotin portion hydrolyzed 
with the seawater (pH: 8.0-8.3). As a result, not only 
the organotin serves as an antifouling agent, but also 
the polymer surface which has been made soluble in 
seawater is gradually eroded by the moving seawater to 
bare out the new coating surface, thus producing a 
long-lasting stabilized antifouling effect. However, 
the organotin released into the seawater from the paints 
is hard to decompose and may be taken in by and accumulated 
in marine organisms and, through the food chain, 
it may get into the human system. This involves the 
possibility of causing serious physical trouble such as 
deformity. So, use of the dangerous organotin compounds 
has been restricted. Request is now voiced in the art for the 
development of a resin for antifouling paints which are 
capable of producing a long-lasting stabilized antifouling 
effect, in place of the highly dangerous organotin-based 
resins. Ideally speaking, it is desirable that
