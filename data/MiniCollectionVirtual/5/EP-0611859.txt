<ABSTRACT>
A security fitting 9 concealed in the rebate 10 between a vent frame 2 
and a surrounding fixed frame 3 to resist forced entry by a tool inserted into 

the rebate 10 when the vent frame 2 is closed. The fitting 9 comprises 
respective formations 16,18 arranged to extend lengthwise of opposed side 

edges 5 and 13 respectively of the vent frame 2 and fixed frame 3 and to 
interlock when the vent frame 2 is closed to anchor the vent frame 2 and 

prevent the opposed side edges 5,13 being forced apart in the plane of the 
fixed frame 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to security fittings for windows, doors 
and the like closures. Casement windows are susceptible to forced entry by a lever force 
applied to the opening vent frame by a crowbar or the like inserted into the 
rebate between the vent frame and the surrounding fixed frame to force 
apart the vent frame and fixed frame. In an attempt to improve security, various locking mechanisms have 
been proposed including multi-point locking mechanisms such as 
espagnolettes arranged to secure the vent frame at a plurality of spaced 
apart positions around the periphery. The effectiveness of such mechanisms however depends on the 
ability of the window, and more especially the materials used to construct 
the vent and fixed frames, to resist the applied forces. Thus, timber 
windows may be forced by splitting or breaking the timber section in which 
the fixings employed to secure the locking mechanism are located while 
plastic windows may be forced by deforming the frame section to spring 
open the locking mechanism. The present invention has been made from a consideration of this 
problem and has for its object the provision of a security fitting of simple 
construction that resists forcing of the vent frame when closed. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
security fitting for a window, door or the like comprising a vent frame 
supported for opening movement relative to a surrounding fixed frame, the 
fitting comprising respective coupling means arranged in use to extend 
lengthwise of opposed side edges of the vent frame and fixed frame and cooperating 
within a rebate or gap between the opposed side edges when the 
vent frame is closed to resist separation of the side edges in a direction 
substantially normal to the direction of opening movement of the vent frame. The invented security fitting anchors the vent frame against 
application of a lever force applied by inserting a crowbar into the rebate 
between the vent frame and fixed frame whilst permitting normal opening 
and closing of the vent frame. Advantageously, the coupling means have respective formations 
arranged in use to interlock when the vent frame is closed to prevent the 
side edges being forced apart in the plane of the fixed frame. For example,  
 
the formations may be generally of L or U shape providing interlocking 
flanges extending parallel to and spaced from the side edges. Preferably, each coupling means is separate from the associated 
frame and may be secured thereto by any

A security fitting for a window, door or the like comprising a vent 
frame (2;102) supported for opening movement relative to a surrounding 

fixed frame (3;103) characterised in that the fitting (9;109) comprises 
respective coupling means (11,12;111,112) arranged in use to extend 

lengthwise of opposed side edges (5,13;105;113) of the vent frame (2;102) 
and fixed frame (3;103) and co-operating within a rebate or gap (10;110) 

between the opposed side edges (5,13;105,113) when the vent frame (2;102) 
is closed to resist separation of the side edges (5,13;105,113) in a direction 

substantially normal to the direction of opening movement of the vent 
frame (2;102). 
A security fitting according to Claim 1 characterised in that the 
coupling means (11,12;111,112) comprise respective 

formations (16,18;116,118) of L or U shape arranged in use to interlock 
when the vent frame (2;102) is closed to prevent the side 

edges (5,13;105,113) being forced apart in the plane of the fixed 
frame (3;103). 
A security fitting according to Claim 2 characterised in that each 
coupling means (11,12;111,112) is adapted for securing to the associated 

frame (2,3;102,103). 
A security fitting according to Claim 2 characterised in that one or 
both coupling means is formed integrally with the associated frame. 
A security fitting according to any one of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that the coupling means (11,12;111,112) are associated with 

fastening means (4;104) for securing the vent frame (2;102) closed. 
A security fitting according to Claim 5 characterised in that one of the 
coupling means (112) is provided by a keeper (130) for the fastening 

means (104). 
A security fitting according to Claim 6 characterised in that the 
fastening means (104) has a bolting member (133) movable from an 

inoperative position to an operative position for engagement with the
