<DESCRIPTION>
Regular use of chemicals to control unwanted organisms can select for drug resistant
strains. This has occurred in many species of economically important pests. The development
of drug resistance necessitates a continuing search for new control agents having different modes
of action.Many hundreds of strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) produce insecticidal toxins
designated as delta endotoxins. They are synthesized by sporulating B.t. cells. When toxin is
ingested by a susceptible insect, the cells of the gut epithelium are destroyed.The reported activity spectrum of B.t. covers insect species within the orders Lepidoptera
and Coleoptera, many of which are major pests in agriculture and forestry. The activity spectrum
also includes the insect order Diptera, which includes mosquitoes and black flies. See Couch, T.L.
(1980) "Mosquito Pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis," Developments in
Industrial Microbiology 22:61-76; Beegle, C.C. (1978) "Use of Entomogenous Bacteria in
Agroecosystems," Developments in Industrial Microbiology 20:97-104. Two varieties of B.t. known
to kill mosquitos and blackflies are B.t. israelensis (B.t.i.) (Goldberg, L.J., J. Margalit [1977]
Mosquito News 37:355-358) and B.t. morrisoni (B.t.m.) (Padua, L.E., M. Ohba, K. Aizawa [1984]
J. Invertebrate Pathology 44:12-17). These are not harmful to non-target organisms (Mulla, M.S.,
B.A. Federici, H.A. Darwazeh [1982] Environmental Entomology 11:788-795), and play an
important role in the integrated management of dipteran pests. They are safe to use in urban
areas, and can be used in aquatic environments without harm to other species. Dipteran insects
are serious nuisances as well as being vectors of many serious human and animal diseases such
as malaria, onchocerciasis, equine encephalitis, and dog heartworm.A small number of research articles have been published about the effects of δ-endotoxins
from B. thuringiensis species on the viability of nematode eggs. Bottjer, Bone, and Gill
(Experimental Parasitology 60:239-244, 1985) have reported that B.t. kurstaki and B.t. israelensis
were toxic in vitro to eggs of the nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis. In addition, 28 other
B.t. strains were tested with widely variable toxicities. Ignoffo and Dropkin (Ignoffo, C.M. and
Dropkin, V.H. [1977] J. Kans. Entomol. Soc. 50:394-398) have reported that the thermostable
toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (beta exotoxin) was active against certain nematodes. Beta
exotoxin is a generalized cytotoxic agent with little or
