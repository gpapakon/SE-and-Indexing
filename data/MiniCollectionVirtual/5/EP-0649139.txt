<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus reproduces data from a recording 
medium by a partial response method and decodes data by 

use of a shift register by the Viterbi decoding technique. 
The shift register has flip-flops Da
j
 which latch data 
and are connected in series, and the XOR gates (31a to 

31d) connected between the flip-flops Da
j
 and used as 
operating means for calculating the exclusive disjunction 

of the outputs of the flip-flops so that CRC operation is 
executed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
reproducing apparatus suitable for use in a case where
information recorded on, for example, a magnetic disc, a
magnetic tape, an optical disc, a magneto-optical disc and so on
is decoded with a maximum likelihood decoding method such as a
Viterbi decoding method or the like.A partial response is used as a modulation code used
in a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus or an optical
recording and reproducing apparatus. Of kinds of the partial
response, PRS (1,1) (class I), PRS (1,-1), PRS (1,0 -1) (class
IV) and so on are used frequently. An arithmetic circuit 101
shown in FIG. 6(a) uses the PRS (1,0,-1). Arithmetic circuits
102, 103 shown in FIG. 6(b) use the PRS (1,-1). A system
polynomial G(D) of the PRS (1,0,-1) is G(D)=1-D2 and a system
polynomial G(D) of the PRS (1,-1) is G(D)=1+D, where reference
letter D represents a delay operator.The arithmetic circuit 101 is a circuit which
successively outputs data of 1, 0 and -1 when an independent
logic 1 is input. The arithmetic circuits 102, 103 are circuits
which successively output data of 1 and -1 when an independent
logic 1 is input.The arithmetic circuit 101 (PRS(1,0,-1)) shown in FIG. 
6(a) has the system polynomial of G(D)=1-D2 and hence always
calculates input data yk inputted at a certain sampling time k
as a two previous sample yk-2. Accordingly, an odd number sample
and an even number sample are substantially independent of each
other and can be regarded as independent series of the partial
response PRS (1,-1). The circuit shown in FIG. 6(a) is equal to
a circuit shown in FIG. 6(b) in which the odd and even number
samples of input data are respectively supplied to and processed
by the arithmetic circuits 102, 103 for calculating the partial
response PRS (1,-1) by switching a switch 104 and outputs of the
arithmetic circuits are synthesized by a switch 105 to be
output.Decoding in which the arithmetic circuits 102, 103
(PRS (1,-1)) are used with being interleaved is substantially
the same as decoding carried out by the arithmetic circuit 101
(PRS(1,0,-1)). Here, the partial response PRS (1,0,-1) will be
explained by way of example.The partial response PRS (1,0,-1) itself has property
of permitting an error to be propagated and hence is followed by
a risk such that if one bit error is caused under a certain
condition, then a fatal error is caused. Therefore, in order to
prevent such error from being caused, it is necessary to precode
data before recording them. This pre-coding can be
