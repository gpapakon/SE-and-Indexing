<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an electric razor with a foil and a shaver head which works in conjunction with the foil and which is driven by an optionally electronically timed motor. Fitted to the razor is a display (4) which is connected to an operating-time measurement device (2) and/or a device for measuring the load on the foil and an evaluation circuit. This improves the operational safety of the razor.

Electric shaver comprising a shaving foil and a shaving 
head cooperating with said shaving foil and actuated by a 

motor, as well as a display means (4) and a running-time meter 
for foil exchange recommendation, characterized in that the 

display means (4) is connected with a means for recording the 
load on the shaving foil and with an evaluation circuit. 
Electric shaver comprising a shaving foil and a shaving 
head cooperating with said shaving foil and actuated by an 

electronically clocked motor, as well as a display means (4) 
for foil exchange recommendation, characterized in that the 

display means (4) is connected with a running-time meter (2) 
triggered by the clocking of the motor and with an evaluation 

circuit. 
A shaver according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
means for recording the load on the shaving foil is comprised 

of a power consumption meter whose measured values are 
connected to the display means (4) via an evaluation circuit, 

in particular an integrator. 
A shaver according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
means for recording the load on the shaving foil comprises 

pressure sensors cooperating with the shaving foil. 
A shaver according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
battery or accumulator voltage change during operation is 

evaluated as a signal for recording the load on the shaving 
foil. 
A shaver according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the display means (4) is clearable via a 

switching contact (5) resetting the meter (2).  
 
A shaver according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
switching contact (5) is mechanically coupled with the shaving 

foil, being automatically actuatable at an exchange of the 
shaving foil. 
A shaver according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 
the metering or evaluation circuit, respectively, connected 

with the display means (4) comprises a settable and resettable 
flip-flop (3) capable of being set by the metering or 

evaluation circuit, respectively, and reset by a switching 
contact (5).
