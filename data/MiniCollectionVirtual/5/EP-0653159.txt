<ABSTRACT>
The composition contains either an amino derivative or an aldehyde derivative, and comprises at least 0.001% of a pyrrolidone derivative in order to avoid the caking of agglomerates or adhesion on use of the composition by bringing into contact either with an aldehyde derivative or an amino derivative. The invention makes it possible to avoid the formation of caking of agglomerates, or adhesion.

Use of a pyrrolidone derivative to prevent agglomeration or adhesion when
a composition containing amino derivatives or aldehydic derivatives is brought into

contact with incompatible chemical substances such as amino derivatives when the
composition contains aldehydic derivatives, or aldehydic derivatives when the

composition contains amino derivatives.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that said composition contains at
least 0.001% by weight of the above-mentioned pyrrolidone derivative.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the pyrrolidone
derivative is a polyvinylpyrrolidone.
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
polyvinylpyrrolidone concentration is at least 0.001% up to a maximum

concentration allowing manufacture and formulation as lozenges, tablets or
powder.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the amino
derivative is a primary and/or secondary and/or tertiary amine derivative and/or an

alkyl and/or aryl derivative and/or a polyamine and/or an alkylaminoglycine and/or
a tertiary alkylamine.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the amino
derivative is a diaminopropyllaurylamine.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the aldehydic
derivatives are formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde.
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
composition is produced in the form of a liquid, a gel, capsules, lozenges or

powder.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
concentration of the above-mentioned amino derivatives is between 0.001% and

10% by weight.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the
concentration of ald
ehydic derivatives is between 0.001 and 10% by weight and
preferably between 8 and 10%.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the
concentration of pyrrolidone derivatives is between 0.01% and 5% by weight.
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 11 in the field of disinfection or 
cleaning.
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 11 in the field of the cleaning and
disinfection of surgical equipment, for example, and more particularly, the cleaning

and disinfection of endoscopes, i.e. exploratory instruments used in the medical
field which are equipped with microducts necessary for taking biopsy specimens by

aspiration, said composition making it possible, during contact with incompatible
chemical substances such as aldehydic derivatives when the composition contains

amino derivatives, or amino derivatives when the composition contains aldehydic
derivatives, to avoid agglomeration or adhesion, which forms blockages rendering

the equipment unsuitable for the intended use.
Disinfection or cleaning method comprising the use of a disinfecting or
cleaning composition containing either an amino derivative or an aldehydic

derivative in an effective amount for carrying out disinfection or cleaning,
characterized in that at least 0.001% by weight of a pyrrolidone derivative is added

to said composition prior to said disinfection or cleaning so as to avoid
agglomeration or adhesion during contact with incompatible chemical substances

when said composition is used.
Method according to Claim 14, characterized in that it is applied to the
disinfection or cleaning of surgical equipment, for example, and more particularly,

the cleaning and disinfection of endoscopes, i.e. exploratory instruments used in
the medical field which are equipped with microducts necessary for taking biopsy

specimens by aspiration, thereby avoiding agglomeration or adhesion, which forms
blockages rendering the equipment unsuitable for the intended use.
Composition containing amino derivatives except for quaternary amines, or
composition containing aldehydic derivatives, which can be brought into contact

with incompatible chemical substances without agglomeration or adhesion,
characterized in that it contains essentially either said amino derivative, or said

aldehydic derivative, and a pyrrolidone derivative at a concentration of between at
least 0.001% and 5% by weight, with the exclusion of a polyvinylpyrrolidone

concentration of 5% by weight when the aldehydic derivative is glutaraldehyde.
Composition containing amino derivatives, characterized in that it contains
essentially, as the amino derivatives, an amine selected from the group consisting

of an amine of one or other of the following structural chemical formulae: 


in which:

N;
or a fatty acid/alkyleneamine addition product such as lauryldiethylamine or
laurylpropyleneamine, which is primary, secondary or tertiary or in the form of a

diamine or triamine;
and a pyrrolidone derivative at a concentration of between at least 0.001% and 5%
by weight.
