<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to (i) homogeneous polyethylenes having 
a narrow molecular weight distribution and a narrow comonomer 
distribution and (ii) ethylene/propylene copolymer rubbers (EPRs), 
which include ethylene/propylene copolymers (EPMs) and 
ethylene/propylene/ethylidene norbornene terpolymers (EPDMs), 
generally having a crystalline content of less than 15 percent by 
weight, and a process for their production. Homogeneous polyethylenes and EPRs are elastomeric 
copolymers and terpolymers used in such applications as hose and 
tubing, wire and cable, gaskets, and single ply roofing. They are 
usually formulated with fillers, oils, processing aids, and stabilizing 
agents. The EPRs are presently manufactured commercially in 
solution and slurry processes with soluble vanadium catalysts. These 
processes are very expensive to run, requiring solvent removal and 
steam stripping steps. In addition, these solution catalysts do not 
provide satisfactory particle morphology in a fluidized bed. 
Improvement in these processes would be desirable and, particularly, 
the development of a gas phase process to produce these same products 
would be more economically attractive because little post-reaction cost 
will be incurred, and particle morphology would, expectedly, be 
improved. One of the catalyst systems selected to produce these polymers 
in the gas phase is described in United States patent 4,508,842. 
Typically, the catalyst system is comprised of a catalyst precursor, 
which is the reaction product of vanadium trichloride and an electron 
donor, the precursor being reacted with an aluminum containing  
 
modifier, and impregnated into a silica support; a promoter such as 
chloroform; and a triisobutylaluminum cocatalyst. This catalyst 
system produces a compositionally heterogeneous resin. It does 
achieve good particle morphology, but the non-uniform composition 
and broad molecular weight distribution results in polyethylene 
products with poor transparency and poor heat-sealing properties. In 
addition, EPRs made with this catalyst exhibit poor cure and contain 
much high temperature crystallinity. This is believed to be the result 
of poorly distributed propylene, and, in the case of the EPDMs, poorly 
distributed diene. An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a process for 
the production of homogeneous polyethylenes and EPRs, i.e., those 
having a crystallinity of less than 15 percent by weight, which 
are relatively free of the deficiencies mentioned above. Other objects
