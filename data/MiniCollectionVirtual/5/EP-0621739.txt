<ABSTRACT>
A thermally insulating layer (7) is located between an induction hotplate (5), which is made from a temperature-sensitive material, and the bottom (17) of the cooking vessel. The gap between the induction coil (3) and the underside of the hotplate (5) is cooled by a high-pressure blower (8,9) whose intake opening is connected to the open centre of the induction coil (3). For thermostatic control, the temperature of the food to be cooked is sensed by a hydraulic sensor (19) in the bottom (17) of the cooking vessel and is transmitted mechanically in the form of a movement to a switching permanent magnet (16) which, for the purpose of switching the cooking power, actuates in a wire-free manner a reed contact (14) arranged under the hotplate (5). The regulator for the temperature of the food to be cooked is constructed as a plug-type thermostat which can be removed from the cooking vessel (32) and carries a rigid enclosing tube (35) which contains the temperature sensor and which is inserted into a hole (34) in the bottom (33) of the cooking vessel. When using the cooking-vessel plug-type thermostat for conventionally heated cooking zones (31,47,48) a reed relay (50,51) and additionally a time switch element (52) is used under the hotplate (31), which time switch element operates as interval switch and generates periodically for in each case a specific duration in the coil (51) of the reed relay a weak counter-excitation with respect to the field of the switching magnet (42).

Cooking system, consisting of an induction cooking hob which has a cooking
surface (5) of temperature sensitive material, preferably of wood, plastic,

ceramic, slate, marble or granite and which is cooled from below, as well as a
cooking pot (6), suitable for inductive heating, which is characterised by a

thermally insulating layer (7) arranged between the upper side of the cooking
surface (5) and the heated bottom of the cooking pot (6), and a gap (10),

present between the induction coil (3) and the lower side of the cooking
surface (5), in which a cooling air flow is caused by a blower (8, 9) producing a

strong pressure and joined directly with the open centre of the induction coil
(3), whereby the blower (8, 9) is preferably joined with its suction aperture to

the open centre of the induction coil (3).
Cooking system according to Claim 1, characterised in that the outlet end (11)
of the blower (8, 9) is passed into the power supply (12) for the induction coil

(3) and the cooking surface (5) provided with ribs on its lower side which are
arranged radially and joined to the induction coil (3).
Cooking system according to Claims 1-2, characterised in that at least one
magnetically operated contact (14) (reed contact) is arranged as switching

point for a power feed and a temperature probe (19) is provided under the
cooking surface, which is arranged at the side on the bottom or in a horizontal

hole (18) in the bottom of the cooking pot (6) and on heating beyond a set
temperature moves a permanent magnet (16) mounted on the side of the

cooking pot via an expansion element (21), so operating the contact (14) which
switches off a cooking power feed and which, on undercutting the set

temperature, moves the permanent magnet (16) back so that the contact (14)
switches on the cooking power.
Cooking system according to Claim 3, characterised in that the permanent
magnet (16) of the cooked food temperature control device acts on various

contacts (14) which switch different power stages of the power supply
depending on the rotated position of the cooking pot (6).
Cooking system according to Claim 3, characterised in that a thermostat,
mainly consisting of the temperature probe (35), switching magnet (42) and

temperature setting device (40, 43), is formed as an autonomous component,
so that it can be used for cooking pots of different size and type and is fitted to

the cooking pot (32) preferably using a jacket tube (35) rigidly mounted on the
thermostat and containing the temperature probe which can be inserted in the

horizontal hole (34) in the bottom of the cooking pot (33) reaching
approximately to the centre of the cooking pot or which even completely

penetrates the bottom, and in that releasable mounting aids are provided which
hold the insertion thermostat on the cooking pot (32), whereby the mounting

aids can be so formed that they act as a type of switch-on block and the
temperature dependent lateral movement or rotational movement of the

switching magnet (42) or the influence on the reed contact (50) by the 
switching magnet (42) is only possible if the insertion thermostat is mounted

properly on the cooking pot (32).
Cooking system according to Claim 5, characterised by a jacket tube (35)
which itself forms the temperature probe and is divided internally by a partition

(36) such that only the front part contains liquid (37) and the capillary (38)
already begins within the jacket tube (35) at the partition (36).
Cooking system according to Claim 5, characterised in that the temperature
probe arranged inside the jacket tube (35) is formed as an extensible rod which

moves the switching magnet (42) depending on the temperature and its
temperature expansion coefficient which differs from that of the jacket tube

(35).
Cooking system according to Claim 5, characterised in that instead of the
switching magnet (42) being moved in the thermostat, a ferromagnetic screen

between the switching magnet (42) and the reed contact (50) is moved
depending on the temperature.
Cooking system according to Claim 5, characterised in that to facilitate the
correct positioning of the insertion thermostat on the reed contact switching

surface

either the cooking hob (31) above the reed contact (50) is provided with a
hump which engages in a corresponding recess in the bottom of the insertion

thermostat,
or the reed contact switching surface is enlarged by a number of adjacently
arranged reed contacts (50) electrically connected in parallel.
Cooking system according to Claim 5, characterised by the formation of the
reed contact (50) as a reed relay and a timer (52) arranged under the cooking

hob (31) which operates as an interval switch and which periodically applies an
electrical direct voltage for a certain time interval to the coil (51) of the reed

relay, the direct current of which acts as a weak magnetic counter-excitation to
the field of the switching magnet (42) on the reed contact (50) but which is not

itself sufficient to operate the reed contact (50).
