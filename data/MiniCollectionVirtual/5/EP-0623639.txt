<CLAIMS>
A process for oxidizing a polymer containing thioether 
groups, which comprises oxidizing the polymer 

in solid form in a suspension medium at reaction 
temperatures of from -10 to +80Â°C with ozone. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
suspension medium used is a mineral acid, an aliphatic 

alcohol or an aliphatic carboxylic acid each 
having 1-6 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, a 

carboxylic ester of these compounds, halogenated or 
non-halogenated hydrocarbons having 1-12 carbon 

atoms, or a mixture of the specified compounds. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
reaction times are up to 2 hours. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the polyarylene thioethers used have 

recurring units of the formulae:  
 


The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the polyphenylene thioether used has an 

average molecular weight of from 4000 to 200,000 and 
an average particle size of from 5 x 10
-6
 to 
500 x 10
-6
 m. 
A process for producing molded and functional parts 
as claimed in any of claimns 1-5, which comprises 

carrying out thermoplastic processing or sintering 
in a further process step.
