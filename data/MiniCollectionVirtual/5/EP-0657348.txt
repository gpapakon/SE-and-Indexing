<ABSTRACT>
A water jet propulsor powered by an integral canned 
electric motor includes a hollow housing (4) having a 

hermetically sealed stator (14) mounted therein. The 
stator is electrically connected to a source of 

electrical energy (18) in the vessel. An impeller 
assembly (20) that includes a tubular suction shroud 

(22) and impeller (24) is rotatably mounted inside the 
housing. Th
e impeller assembly includes a hermetically 
sealed rotor (26) which is mounted around the suction 

shroud and positioned inside the stator in operative 
association therewith. Energizing the stator rotates 

the rotor, which in turn rotates the impeller to pump 
water from the intake end (10) of the housing to the 

outlet end (12) of the housing and adds velocity and 
head to the water to be discharged from the outlet end. 

The discharged water creates thrust which propels the 
vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water jet propulsor for
a marine vessel.Water jet propulsors are often used as the main
drives for high cruising speed leisure, commercial and
naval marine vessels. The basic operating principal of
water jet propulsion is similar to that of a screw-type
propeller system. The propelling force is generated by
adding momentum to the water by accelerating a certain
flow of water in an astern direction. Water from under
the vessel is fed through an inlet duct to an onboard
pump which adds head to the water. This head is then
applied to increase the velocity when the water passes
through an outlet nozzle into the ambient atmospheric
pressure. Steering and reversing forces are generated
by deflecting the discharged flow using a flow
deflection bucket which is typically hydraulically
operated. The water jet system is typically located in
the stern of the vessel and is positioned at an
elevation which enables it to be self priming when
activated and which maximizes propulsion efficiency.Benefits of water jet propulsion include reduced
noise, improved maneuverability, protected propulsion
installation and shallow draft. The fuel efficiency of
water jet propulsors is often better than with
traditional sub-cavitating propellers at speeds above 20
to 25 knots, depending on the type of vessel.Figure 1 schematically illustrates a typical water
jet installation of the prior art. The prior art water
jet propulsion system of Figure 1 requires a power
source, such as a diesel engine, steam turbine or gas 
turbine, P to be located near the water jet impeller I. In addition, the power
source P must be mechanically coupled to the impeller I by a drive shaft D
through gear box and clutch T. Drive shaft D must be located within water flow
conduit C, thereby interfering with the flow of water. In addition, seals are
required around drive shaft D where it passes through the wall of water flow
conduit C. This arrangement limits the flexibility for designing the vessel within
which such a system is utilized. With this type of arrangement, most of the
propulsion weight must be located in the stern of the vessel and the location of
the pump center line is dictated by the size of the propulsion components.There remains a need for a water jet propulsor that does not require a drive
shaft to be located in the water flow conduit and which does not require the seals
associated with a drive shaft passing through the walls of the water flow conduit.
There also remains a need for a water jet propulsor which can
