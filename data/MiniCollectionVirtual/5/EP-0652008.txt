<ABSTRACT>
Despite its potency and broad spectrum 
antibacterial activity, the therapeutic effectiveness of 

ciprofloxacin is limited in that it has a short elimination 
half-life and its potency against some bacteria may be 

compromised by the ability of some intracellular bacteria to 
reside and multiply within the human host cells where they 

are protected from the antibiotic. These problems can be 
solved by encapsulating the antibiotic within the 

microscopic lipid vesicles called liposomes, which protect 
the drug from dilution and elimination from the body. 

Moreover, the liposome-encapsulated antibiotic is naturally 
taken up by phagocytic cells which results in the delivery 

of the drug to intracellular sites of infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of improving 
the effectiveness of an antibiotic, and specifically to a 
method of improving the therapeutic effectiveness of 
ciprofloxacin. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutically 
active ciprofloxacin composition. New antibiotics which are more powerful and which 
display a broad spectrum activity against a number of 
different bacteria than existing compounds are continuously 
being developed. Among these new generations of antibiotics 
are a family of antibiotics called quinolones. Quinolones are very powerful antibiotics because 
they are structurally unrelated to the conventional 
antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins and 
tetracyclines. Therefore, many of the pathogenic bacteria 
which are resistant to the conventional antibiotics are 
highly susceptible to the bactericidal actions of 
quinolones. Moreover, the quinolones have significantly 
higher bioavailability rates than conventional penicillins, 
ranging from 75% to approaching 100% (compared to 45-50% for 
penicillin G). Ciprofloxacin is the most potent member of 
quinolones. As with other quinolones, ciprofloxacin's 
bactericidal action is achieved through inhibition of 
bacterial DNA gyrase system, which is an essential component 
of the bacterial DNA replication system. The antibacterial 
activity of ciprofloxacin is further enhanced by its unique  
 
cyclopropyl side chain. In addition to its potency, 
ciprofloxacin has broad spectrum activity and is extremely 
effective against most gram negative and some gram positive 
pathogenic bacteria, with low occurrence of resistance to 
the drug. Despite its potency and broad spectrum activity, 
the therapeutic effectiveness of ciprofloxacin as an 
antibiotic is limited by the following factors: 
(a) ciprofloxacin has a short elimination half-life of only 
4.0 hours (compared to 10.0 hours for pefloxacin, another 
quinolone). Once administered, the drug is rapidly diluted 
and cleared from the body, thus making it difficult to reach 
therapeutic concentrations; (b) ciprofloxacin has been known to increase serum levels 
and hence the toxicity of concurrently administered 
theophylline. One study found that 20 of 33 patients taking 
both drugs developed increases of theophylline, many to the 
toxic range; (c) the potency of ciprofloxacin against some pathogenic 
bacteria may be compromised by the ability of some 
intracellular bacteria to reside and multiply within human 
host cells, and hence remain protected from the powerful 
antibiotic.
