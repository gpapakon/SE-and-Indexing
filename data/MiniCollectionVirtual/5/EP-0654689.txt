<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
module for two-way transmission.In recent years, research and development of
application of an optical transmission system to subscriber
systems has been pursued on an implementation
level. For example, it is proposed that a two-way optical
transmission system through the use of the same
wavelength or wavelength multiplex be applied to subscriber
systems. The proposed system is such that
carries on two-way optical transmission through a single
optical fiber linking the station and each subscriber's
terminal, and the establishment of technology to mass-produce
the optical module for two-way transmission
functioning for transmission and reception in the subscribers'
terminal devices is one of the key technologies
in implementing the system.The commonest structure to achieve transmitting
and receiving functions in a subscriber's device in the
subscriber system to which two-way optical transmission 
can be applied includes an LD module structured so as to
converge light emitted from a laser diode chip into the
excitation end of a first optical fiber, a PD module
structured so as to converge light emitted from the
excitation end of a second optical fiber into a photodiode
chip, and an optical coupler for coupling the first
and the second optical fibers to a third optical fiber as
the optical transmission path. Since the above mentioned
structure is disadvantageous in terms of downsizing and
cost reduction, there are proposed optical modules for
two-way transmission in which the functions of transmission
and reception can be achieved by a single unit.An example of an optical module for two-way
transmission in the related art includes an LD collimator
formed by integrating a laser diode chip and a lens, a PD
collimator formed by integrating a photodiode chip and a
lens, a fiber collimator formed by integrating an end of
an optical fiber and a lens, and an optical coupler
structured by forming a filter film on a glass substrate.
The LD collimator, PD collimator, fiber collimator, and
the optical coupler are for example fixed on the substrate
in predetermined relative positions. A transmitted
light output from the LD collimator is for example reflected
by the filter film and input to the fiber collimator, 
while a received light output from the fiber
collimator is for example allowed to pass through the
filter film and a glass block and input to the PD collimator.Another example of an optical module for two-way
transmission in the related art includes a Y-branch
type
