<ABSTRACT>
An attachment for a hairdryer is disclosed which comprises 
a attachment member 100 for connection to the nozzle of a 

hairdryer and a flow diverter 200. The flow diverter 
diverts the direction of air flow from that shown by arrows 

A to arrows B. The diverter is rotatable relative to the 
member 100 and vanes 220 are provided slanted to the 

direction of air flow from the hairdyer, so that 
impingement of air on the vanes 220 causes the diverter 200 

to rotate thus providing air flow having a continually 
varying flow direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hairdryers. Hairdryers which blow a stream of hot air onto hair to be 
dried have been known for many years. A basic hairdryer 
comprises a fan, a heating element and a casing forming a 
direction nozzle through which air heated by the heating 
element is blown by the fan. It is a object of the invention to provide hairdrying 
apparatus which provides an improved hair drying function. According to the invention there is provided a nozzle for 
a hairdryer including means for varying the direction of 
air flow therefrom. Preferably, the means comprises a rotatable flow director 
and means for driving the flow director in rotation. Preferably the rotation means comprises a turbine means 
having at least one vane disposed in the nozzle, the vane 
being slanted relative to the direction of air flow, so 
that air impingement causes a rotation force to be applied 
to the director.  Preferably the flow director has an outlet for directing 
air at an angle to the axis of rotation of the director. In the embodiment of the invention described, the flow 
director rotates by virtue of the vanes disposed therein 
causing the flow direction of the air from the hairdryer 
also to rotate, thus disturbing the hair to a greater 
extent than direct impingement of air and causing the hair 
to dry more quickly and to be disturbed more thus giving 
greater body when dried. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way 
of example with reference to the accompanied drawings in 
which: Figure 1 shows two views of an attachment member for 
connection to a hairdryer, Figure 1A being a cross 
sectional view and Figure 1B being a view in the direction 
of arrow 1 of Figure 1A. Figure 2 shows two views of a flow director, Figure 2A 
being a cross sectional view and Figure 2B being a view in 
the direction of arrow 2 of Figure 2A. Figure 3 is a cross 
sectional view through a vane of the director of Figure 2 
in the direction 3'-3' of Figure 2A.  Figure 4 is a cross sectional view showing the attachment 
member and flow director of Figures 1-3 connected together. With reference to Figures, an embodiment of the invention 
is shown which comprises a member 100 for connection to a 
hairdryer and a flow director 200 connected to the 
attachment member 100 so as to be rotatable relative 
thereto. Attachment member 100 includes a connector portion 110 
arranged to engage an internal corresponding snap fit 
connector of a hairdryer nozzle (not shown). It will be 
readily understood that this connector
