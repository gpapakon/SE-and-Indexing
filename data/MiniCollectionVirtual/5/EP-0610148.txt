<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of measuring the temperature of the space of one or more workpieces which is subjected to a temperature rise during a welding or crimping operation. It consists in using the thermoelectric sources formed at at least one of the interfaces which is located between at least one electrode (5; 10, 11) and the said workpieces (1; 13, 14) and between the said workpieces, in causing the said thermoelectric sources to output into an electrical resistor (16), in measuring the current which passes through said resistor (16) and in deducing a temperature signal therefrom. The invention also relates to methods of controlling at least one welding or crimping parameter of a welding or crimping operation, these methods forming applications of such a measurement method.

Process for measuring the temperature of the space of 
one or several parts (1; 13; 14) which undergoes a rise in 

temperature during a welding or crimping operation, consisting 
in utilizing the thermoelectric sources formed at at least one 

of the interfaces located between at least one electrode (5; 
10, 11) and the said parts (1; 13, 14) and between the said 

parts, the said electrode or electrodes (5; 10, 11) which are 
in contact with the said space, in feeding the said 

thermoelectric sources into an electric resistance (16), in 
measuring the current which passes through the said resistance 

(16) and in deducing from this a temperature signal. 
Measurement process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the said resistance (16) has terminals 

(16a and 16b) which are connected, respectively, to one 
electrode (5; 10, 11) or to one of the said parts (1; 13, 14) 

and to the other electrode (11, 10) or to another part (1; 14, 
13). 
Process for controlling the magnitude of at least one 
welding parameter of a spot-welding operation, the operation 

consisting in subjecting several parts (13, 14) to the passage 
of a welding current between two electrodes (10, 11) for the 

purpose of raising the temperature of the space contained 
between the said two electrodes (10, 11) and enabling the said 

parts (13, 14) to be welded, and furthermore consisting in: 

a) measuring the intensity of the current passing 
through a resistance (16) whose terminals (16a and 16b) are 

connected, respectively, to an electrode (10) or to one of the 
said parts (13 or 14) and to the other electrode (11) or to 

another part (14 or 13), the said current being generated 
thermoelectrically at at least one of the interfaces between 

the electrodes (10, 11) and the said parts (13, 14) and/or 
between the parts (13, 14),  

 
b) comparing the value of the measured current 
intensity with a predetermined value, and 
c) adjusting the magnitude of the said welding 
parameter or parameters as a function of the result of the 

said comparison. 
Process for controlling the magnitude of at least one 
welding parameter of a hot-crimping operation, the operation 

consisting in subjecting the end (2) of a part (1) to a 
crimping force against another portion (6) of the said same 

part (1) by means of an electrode (5) while passing a current 
into the space contained between the said end (2) and the said 

other portion (6) for the purpose of raising its temperature 
and enabling the said end (2) to be crimped on to the said 

portion (6), and furthermore consisting in: 

a) measuring the intensity of the current passing 
through a resistance (16) whose terminals (16a and 16b) are 

connected, respectively, to an electrode (5) and to the 
portion (6) of the said part (1), the said current being 

generated thermoelectrically at the interface between the 
electrode 
(5) and the end (2) of the said part (1), 
b) comparing the value of the measured current 
intensity with a predetermined value, and 
c) adjusting the magnitude of the said crimping 
parameter or parameters as a function of the result of the 

said comparison.
