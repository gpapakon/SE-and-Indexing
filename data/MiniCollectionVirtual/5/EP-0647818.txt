<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a decentralised heating system for buildings, of multiple out-flow pipe design. A central pipe system of at least three lines (Z, G, K) comprises a pipeline (K) which carries a flow medium at a first (high) temperature, and a second pipeline (Z) for a heat transfer medium which is heated to a second (low) temperature, as well as a third pipeline (G) which is provided as central return. The central pipe system (100) extends over the entire building and is branched locally via branch modules (50-54) into local pipe systems which can be designed for individual storeys. Suitable as branch modules are modules for supplying conventional radiators or modules for domestic water heating (51a). Thus, the invention simplifies the installation of individual heating systems for buildings, while at the same time reducing the storage of pipes, modules and other components of a heating system to be constructed. Owing to the decentralised domestic water heating (51, 51a), hygiene requirements can be better fulfilled.

A decentralised modular bus-type or multiple flow-path 
heating system comprising : 


(a) a central bus (100; G, K, Z) with at least three tracks 
or paths comprising a first pipe system (K) for a heat transfer 

medium heated to a first temperature, a second pipe system (Z) 
for a heat transfer medium heated to a second temperature, and 

a third pipe system (G), the systems being closely adjacent and 
insulated from one another; and 
(b) a number of branch modules (50 to 55) coupled to the 
central bus at required places, at least two of the pipe systems 

(Z, G, K) being coupled to, or uncoupled from, a local bus for 
flow purposes; 
(c) wherein the free end of each local bus formed by a 
branch module leads to a domestic water heater (51) disposed 

inside the module or to a heat exchanger (heat supplier; 60; heat 
consumers; V1, V2, V3) disposed outside the module. 
A heating system according to claim 1, wherein the central 
bus (100) contains a fourth pipe system which conveys a cooling 

medium, and a cold generator can be connected as the heat 
supplier and a cold supplier as the heat consumer. 
A heating system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein each 
branch module contains three or four short pipe portions (40, 41, 

42) in line with the central bus (100) and at least two pipe 
portions (11, 21) which branch transversely from the central bus 

via fittings such as pumps (20), valves, flow-meters or mixers, 
or open into a heat exchanger (51a). 
A heating system according to claim 3, wherein the central 
bus pipe portions (40, 41, 42) end in connecting devices which 

project little if at all beyond the boundary of the branch 
module. 
A heating system according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the  
 

local branch modules for hot-water supply or production comprise 
a pressure connection (FW₁, FW₂, FW₃) for fresh tap water, a local 

domestic-water connection (WW1, WW2, WW3) for heated water for 
domestic use, and a heat exchanger (51a) constituting a consumer 

and coupled via the decentral local bus to the corresponding 
short central-bus pipe portions (40, 41, 42) for flow purposes. 
A heating system according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein a branch module (53) couples a solar collector (60) to 

two of the pipe systems in the central bus (100) in order to 
supply heat decentrally. 
A method of decentralised heat distribution in a large 
building, wherein 


at least two pipe systems (K, Z) supply an entire building 
with hot water separately at different temperatures via a 

central bus (100) and one pipe system (G) in the central 
bus provides a return flow from the entire building at an 

appreciably reduced temperature, and 
decentralised branch modules (50 to 56) connect the central 
bus (100) locally to individual local flow buses in order 

to connect it to heat consumers (V1, V2; 51a; VO) or heat 
suppliers (60) to the central bus. 
A branch module for a modular heating system according to 
any of the preceding claims, wherein at least three main pipe 

portions (40, 41, 42) extend substantially parallel in a narrow 
space and have connections at both ends, and at least two local 

pipe portions (11, 21) branch substantially at right angles 
therefrom and are, or can be, connected to a local heat exchange 

system (70; 51a; VO, VLi, Ri, Vi, WP) or a heat reservoir (SP). 
A branch module according to claim 8, comprising at heat 
exchanger (51a) which constitutes the local heat exchange system 

in that its primary side is connected to two of the substantially 
parallel main pipe portions (G, Z) and its secondary side 

connects a branch module inlet (FWi) for fresh water to a branch  
 

module outlet (WWi) for domestic water which is hot during 
operation. 
A branch module according to claim 8, wherein the two 
branching local pipe portions (11, 21) constitute a local outflow 

pipe (VL
i
) and a local return pipe (R
i
) for a heat-dissipating 
heat sink (V1, V2, V3) or a heat-supplying heat source (60, WP, 

SP). 
A branch module according to claim 10, wherein the two 
branching local pipe portions (11, 21) have connecting means (12, 

22) disposed outside the branch module for a locally-extending 
outflow pipe (VLi) and a return pipe (Ri).
