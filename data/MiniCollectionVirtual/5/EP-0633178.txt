<ABSTRACT>
A brake for the wheels on one axle (24) of a 
pushchair or perambulator comprises a series of radially 

oriented ribs on one side face of each of the wheels and a 
respective brake member (42, 44) mounted for reciprocating 

movement parallel to the axle into and out of engagement 
with the ribs on a corresponding wheel. Each of the brake 

members (42, 44) has a cam follower (38, 40) on its inboard 
end engaging with a cam member (30) which is mounted for 

angular movement about a horizontal axis perpendicular to 
the axle (24). A foot-operated lever (32) is coupled to 

the cam member (30) so that downward pressure on one end 
causes angular movement of the cam member (30) in a first 

direction and downward pressure on the other end causes 
angular movement of the cam member (30) in a second 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brake for a pushchair 
or perambulator having a pair of wheels on opposite ends of 
an axle, the brake being of the type comprising a series of 
radially oriented ribs on one side face of each of said 
wheels, a respective brake member mounted for reciprocating 
movement parallel to the axle into and out of engagement 
with the ribs on a corresponding wheel, and a foot-operated 
control arranged to move the brake members into and out of 
engagement with the ribs on their respective wheels. US-A-4527665 discloses a known brake of this type, 
in which the control is mounted for angular movement about 
a vertical axis. The user's foot has to be pressed against 
one side of the control to cause engagement and the other 
side to cause disengagement. It is also known for the 
foot-operated control to be mounted for angular movement 
about the axle, downward movement causing the brake to be 
engaged and upward movement causing the brake to be 
disengaged. Consequently, it is necessary for a user's toe 
to be hooked under the foot-operated control in order to 
cause disengagement. With both of these known arrangements 
there is a risk of scuffing the user's shoe during 
operation of the brake. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a brake of the type described above in which both 
engagement and disengagement can be effected by downward 
pressure. According to the invention, in a brake of the type 
described above, each of the brake members has a cam 
follower on its inboard end engaging with a cam member 
which is mounted for angular movement about a horizontal 
axis perpendicular to the axle, and the foot-operated 
control comprises an operating lever coupled to the cam 
member so that downward pressure on one end causes angular 
movement of the cam member in a first direction and 
downward pressure on the other end causes angular movement 
of the cam member in a second direction. Preferably the cam followers on the brake members  
 
are biassed by respective springs into engagement with the 
cam. The cam member may include depressions in its surface 
positioned to receive the cam followers when the brake 
members are in their engaged positions so that displacement 
of the cam from its engaged position is resisted by such 
springs. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a pushchair 
having a brake in accordance with the invention: Figure 2 is

<CLAIMS>
A brake for a pushchair or perambulator having a 
pair of wheels (18, 20) on opposite ends of an axle (22), 

the brake comprising a series of radially oriented ribs 
(46) on one side face of each of said wheels (18, 20), a 

respective brake member (42, 44) mounted for reciprocating 
movement parallel to the axle into and out of engagement 

with the ribs (46) on a corresponding wheel (20, 18), and 
a foot-operated control (32) arranged to move the brake 

members (42, 44) into and out of engagement with the ribs 
(46) on their respective wheels (20, 18), characterised in 

that each of the brake members (42, 44) has a cam follower 
(38, 40) on its inboard end engaging with a cam member (30) 

which is mounted for angular movement about a horizontal 
axis perpendicular to the axle (22), and the foot-operated 

control comprises an operating lever (32) coupled to the 
cam member (30) so that downward pressure on one end causes 

angular movement of the cam member (30) in a first 
direction and downward pressure on the other end causes 

angular movement of the cam member (30) in a second 
direction. 
A brake according to claim 1, wherein the cam 
followers (38, 40) are biassed by respective springs (48, 

50) into engagement with the cam member (30). 
A brake according to claim 3, wherein the cam 
member (30) includes depressions (52, 54) in its surface 

positioned to receive the cam followers (38, 40) when the 
brake members (42, 44) are in their engaged positions.
