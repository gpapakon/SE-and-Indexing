<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an item of crockery for presenting a waiter's bill. This item of crockery comprises a body with a base (3) circumscribed by a rim (8), and holding means (1, 2), such as a lid, which lies on the base (3) of said body in order to exert pressure on the top of the waiter's bill inserted between the base (3) of said body and the holding means (1, 2), which item is characterised in that the holding means (1, 2), which are in the general form of a lid, are hinged to the rim (8) of said body in such a way as to enable it to occupy two extreme positions with respect to the base (3) of said body, in one of which it rests on this base so as to hold the bill between the base (3) and the holding means, while in the other it is moved away from said base (3) to give free access (1, 2) to the base (3), the freely pivoting assembly of the holding means (1, 2) on the body being such as to enable the holding means (1, 2) to be moved by hand and by inertia. For service outdoors.

<CLAIMS>
Item of crockery such as a tray, saucer or plate of the type comprising a body with a
bottom (3) circumscribed by an edge (8), and holding means extending against the bottom (3)

of the said body to exert a pressing force against the top face of an information medium such
as a bill inserted between the bottom (3) of the body and the holding means (1, 2),

characterised in that the holding means (1, 2), generally in the form of a cover comprising at
least one surface of any form intended to cover the bottom (3) of the body at least partially,

are articulated on the edge (8) of the said body in such a way as to be able to occupy two
extreme positions with respect to the bottom (3) of the said body, a position of pressing on

this bottom (3) to enable an information medium to be held between the bottom (3) and the
holding means (1, 2), the other position being remote from the said bottom (3) to permit free

access to the bottom (3) of the said body, this freely pivoting mounting of the body/holding
means (1, 2) permitting the holding means (1, 2) to be manoeuvred by inertia by means of the

hand holding the item of crockery.
Item of crockery according to claim 1, characterised in that the holding means (1, 2) for the
information medium are mounted in a pivoting manner on the edge (8) of the said body by

means of a hinge-type connection.
Item of crockery according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the holding
means are in the form of a cover (1, 2) of single or double thickness, of which the end which is

to be articulated on the edge (8) of the said bottom (3) provides a housing (5) able to pivot
about an axis (4) provided on the edge (8) of the said body.
Item of crockery according to claim 3, characterised in that the holding means are in the
form of a cover (1, 2) comprising at least one surface (2) in any form, intended to cover the

bottom (3) of the body at least partially, this surface having an extension forming an arm (2')
which is raised with respect to the surface (2) of the cover and comprising at its free end one

(5) of the articulation elements. 
Item of crockery according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the holding
means are in the form of a cover (1, 2) of which the exte
nsion, having to be articulated at the
edge (8) of the said body, is shaped to form the pivot axis (13) of the cover on the edge (8) of

the said body, this pivot axis (13) passing into a slot, an open housing (12), a notch or
between tabs provided on the edge (8) of the body.
Item of crockery according to claim 5, characterised in that the pivot axis (13) of the cover
(1, 2) is in the form of a cylinder terminating at each of its ends by pins or journals (10) coaxial

with the longitudinal axis of the cylinder.
Item of crockery according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the edge (8) of
the said body comprises a bead (4) constituting the upper edge of a slot provided in the edge

(8) under the said bead in such a way as to permit the holding means (1, 2) to fit around the
said bead and to pivot about the said bead which forms an axis.
Item of crockery according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the holding means
are formed by a first element (1) lined with a second element being in the form of a generally

flat transparent piece (2) able at least partially to cover the surface of the face forming the
bottom (3) of the said item, the said elements (1, 2) being able to be pressed against or fixedly

attached to each other in a removable manner in order to define between the said elements a
space (9) inside of which an advertising medium such as in interchangeable notice is held.
Item of crockery according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the holding means
(2) are formed by an arm (2') terminating, at its end in abutment against the bottom of the

item, in a cavity having an opening orientated towards the bottom of the saucer and inside
which an advertising medium may be inserted.
Item of crockery according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the opening angle
of the holding means is between 0 and 220Â°.
