<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a truck van or cubicle comprising a quadrilateral floor bed, and more 
particularly to closure means for a truck van or cubicle having a movable 
closure web having an access opening which is positionable on the rear or on either side of the 
truck to facilitate loading and unloading the truck, the web aperture being disposed at 
the front of the van in order to effect closure thereof. US Patent 3,709,552 issued January 9, 1973 discloses a truck van having an open side 
which is closable by a slidable curtain suspended from the roof of the van body. US Patent 4,545,611 issued October 8, 1985 discloses a van body having pleated sides 
which afford side openings which are closable by slidable door structure consisting of 
two solid end doors interconnected and bridged by a foldable curtain. US Patent 4,844,524 issued July 4, 1989 discloses a truck trailer closure assembly for 
tensioning a flexible curtain over an opening which includes a shaft with a vertical axis 
together with bearing members rotatably connecting the shaft to the truck trailer. According to one aspect of this invention, a truck van comprises a quadrilateral floor 
bed characterised by a plurality of rollers mounted respectively at the corners of said 
floor bed and having vertically disposed axes, an endless web disposed about said 
rollers and in close contact therewith, an access aperture formed in said web and means 
for imparting bodily movement to said web about said rollers so as selectively to locate 
said access aperture at the front, rear or at either side of said truck van. According to a feature said endless web may comprise a curtain and an endless upper 
and an endless lower belt secured respectively to the upper and lower edges of said 
curtain. According to a further feature some of said rollers may be idlers and at least one of 
said rollers is a drive roller.  
 According to yet another feature web tensioning means may be associated with at least 
some of said rollers for imparting limited web tensioning movement thereto. According to a yet further feature each of said web tensioning means may include 
upper and lower devices associated respectively with the upper and lower ends of at 
least one of said rollers and wherein each of said upper and said lower devices which 
are associated with said rollers are fixedly interconnected by a connecting bar for 
movement in unison. According to yet another feature the upper and lower end portions of said rollers may 
be of reduced diameter for
