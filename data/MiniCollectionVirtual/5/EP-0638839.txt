<ABSTRACT>
In a photosensitive material processing 
apparatus (1), a photosensitive material taking on the form 

of a long strip (A) is fed into a conveyance mechanism and 
conveyed in this form along a predetermined conveyance 

path. An exposure device, a reservoir section, a 
development processing section (4), and a cutter (6) are located 

in the conveyance path. The exposure device (31) carries out 
scanning exposing operations on the long strip of the 

photosensitive material and thereby forms latent images 
on the long strip of the photosensitive material (A). In the 

reservoir section, a looped portion for serving as a 
buffer for conveyance is formed in the long strip of the 

photosensitive material, on which the latent images have 
been formed. In the development processing section (4), 

development processing is carried out on the long strip 
of the photosensitive material (A), which is fed via the 

reservoir section. The cutter cuts (6) the long strip of the 
photosensitive material, which has been subjected to the 

development processing, into sheets having a 
predetermined length.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photosensitive
material processing apparatus, wherein a photosensitive
material is scanned with and exposed to light, latent
images are thereby formed on the photosensitive material,
the photosensitive material is then subjected to
development processing, and positive images are thereby
formed on the photosensitive material. This invention
also relates to a photosensitive material exposing
apparatus for use in the photosensitive material
processing apparatus.Miniature development laboratories and
photosensitive material processing apparatuses, which are
referred to as photoprinters, are provided with an
exposing section, in which a photosensitive material is
exposed to light and a latent image is thereby formed on
the photosensitive material, a development processing
section, in which development, fixing, and washing are
carried out, a drying section, and the like. The
operation for exposing the photosensitive material to
light is carried out by irradiating light, which has
passed through a negative film, to the photosensitive
material. The exposing operations are classified into a 
surface exposing operation and a scanning exposing
operation, which is carried out via a slit.The exposing operation and the development
processing are carried out by conveying the
photosensitive material from the exposing section to the
development processing section. Such operations are
classified into a system, wherein the photosensitive
material is formed into a plurality of sheets before
being exposed to light and the sheets are conveyed one
after another at predetermined intervals, and a system,
wherein a roll of photosensitive material is subjected to
the exposing operation and the development processing and
is finally cut and finished to predetermined lengths by
using a cutter.In the past, a photosensitive material was
subjected to an analog exposing operation, in which the
photosensitive material was exposed to light having
passed through a negative film. Recently, it has been
proposed to carry out a digital scanning exposing
operation, in which a laser beam is modulated in
accordance with image information having been obtained by
reading out an image recorded on a negative film, and a
photosensitive material is scanned with and exposed to
the modulated laser beam. However, in order for the
digital scanning exposing operation to be carried out,
the accuracy, with which the adjustment of the position
of the photosensitive material, conveyance of the
photosensitive material, or the like, is
