<ABSTRACT>
Fastening device, particularly for sports shoes 
including a first flap (4) and a second (5) flap which 

mutually overlap. In the device, at least one flexible tab 
(7) is associated with the first flap or protrudes therefrom 

and has a lever (12) at one end; its other end overlaps the 
second flap. The tab is also interposed between the first 

and second flaps and a covering element (8) which is in turn 
associated, at its end, with the second flap and the lever. 

The first and second flaps are in mutual contact. It is thus 
possible to achieve optimum tightness against water or snow 

at the overlapping regions of the flaps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastening device 
particularly for sports shoes of the type comprising a shell 
or at least one quarter which have a first flap and a second 
flap that mutually overlap. The need to limit water infiltration during sports 
practice inside the shell or the quarters that constitute 
the shoes is currently strongly felt, as said shells or 
quarters have flap overlap regions. The overlap of the flaps in fact never manages to 
eliminate infiltrations of water inside the shoe, such as 
for example a ski boot or an ice skate. Said flaps are in fact made of a relatively rigid 
material and are subject, during use, to mutual sliding 
motions that form small gaps especially along the edges of 
the flaps, particularly when the levers are loosened to 
allow the foot to relax after skiing or skating. In order to obviate these drawbacks, it is known to 
apply a pad made of rubber or plastics especially at the 
transverse edges of the flaps. The purpose of the pad is to 
create a mechanical obstacle to the flow of water from the 
toe unit to the flaps during sports practice. Watertight sealing devices are also known which are 
constituted by two separate inserts which are applied 
separately to different edges of the flaps of the shell. One 
of the two inserts can be arranged at a longitudinal edge of 
a flap. The second insert is in turn constituted by two parts: 
one can be inserted at the transverse edges of the flaps of 
the shell, and the other one is associated, transversely to  
 
the first one, towards the toe of the boot. Even this known solution, disclosed in the Italian 
patent no. 1,039,942 filed on July 18, 1975, has drawbacks: 
first of all there are three components which must be 
partially assembled to each other and to the shell, and, 
moreover, the interaction of all these components with each 
other and with the flaps still does not ensure optimum 
watertightness between them. The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the 
described technical problems in the prior art, by providing 
a device that allows optimum tightness against water 
infiltrations in shoes such as ski boot, roller skates, or 
ice skates which comprise a shell or a quarter provided with 
overlapping flaps. Within the scope of this aim, an important object is to 
provide a device which is structurally simple and easy to 
apply to the sports shoes. Another important object is to provide a device which 
is reliable and safe in use and maintains an optimum 
aesthetic configuration for the shoe.

Fastening device, particularly for sports shoes 
comprising a first flap (4,104) and a second flap (5,105) 

which mutually overlap, characterized in that at least one 
flexible tab (7,107) is associated with said first flap and 

has means for engagement with a lever (12,112), said tab 
being interposed between said first flap and said second 

flap and a covering element (9,109) which is associated with 
said second flap and said lever. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said at least one tab (7,107) is longitudinally extended and 

is arranged transversely to said first (4,104) and second 
(5,105) flaps so as to at least partially surround said 

first and second flaps. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said at least one tab (7,107) is associated, at one end, 

externally to said first flap by at least one first rivet 
(6,106), its free end being directed towards said second 

flap (5,105). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said at least one tab (7,107) protrudes above and externally 

to said first flap (4,104), its free end being directed 
towards said second flap (5,105) and surmounting it. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said at least one tab (7,107) 

surmounts at least part of said first (4,104) and second 
(5,105) flaps and is interposed between said first and 

second flaps and an overlying covering element (8,108). 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
 

said covering element (8,108) is arranged transversely to 
said first (4,104) and second (5,105) flaps and has a first 

end (9,109) which is associated with said second flap 
(5,105) by means of at least one second rivets (17,117). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that 
said covering element (8,108) has a second end (11,111) 

which is associated at said underlying lever (12,112). 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that 
said lever has temporary engagement elements (14) which 

selectively interact with engagement means (15) provided on 
said at least one tab (7) at the end that is associated with 

said first flap or protrudes therefrom. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that 
said engagement means are constituted by a rack-like region 

(15) formed on the surface that lies opposite to said first 
(4) and second (5) flaps. 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that 
said engagement elements are constituted by a cross-member 

(14) which is interposed between the wings (13) that 
constitute said lever (12). 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that 
said engagement elements are constituted by a ratchet-like 

element (118) which can be deactivated by a release button 
(120) and is transversely associated between the wings of 

said lever (112). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said lever (112) is slidingly 

associated with said at least one tab (107).
