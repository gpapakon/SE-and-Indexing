<ABSTRACT>
There is described an anchoring strip (2) for an insertion strip (11) which is used for profiling upholstery (4), covered on its outside by a covering material (12), of upholstered parts (1) and for this purpose has along one longitudinal edge a sew-on lug (13) which can be joined to the covering material (12). The anchoring strip (2) consists of a plastics moulding which is formed in one piece, has a flexible base web (5) capable of being anchored to the upholstery (4) and is equipped, along the longitudinal extent of said base web, with receiving members (6) for the insertion strip (11), which receiving members are arranged at distances from one another and face the outside (8) of the upholstered part (1) and to which said insertion strip (11) can be locked from the outside (8) of the upholstered part (1) to form a firm holding engagement.

An anchoring strip (2) for a pull-in rod (11) for forming the profile on upholstery 
material (4) covered on their outside by a covering material (12) and consisting of foam 

material in the case of upholstered furniture and the like upholstered parts (1) such as seat and 
back parts, the pull-in rod (11) carrying along a longitudinal edge an acceptance tab 

(13) which can be connected to the covering material (12) while the anchoring strip (2) 
consists of, formed in one piece, a synthetic plastics moulding which comprises a flexible 

base web (5) which can be anchored on the upholstery material (4) and which has along 
its longitudinal extension receiving members (6) directed towards the outside (8) of 

the upholstered part (1) and for the pull-in rod (11) and with which this latter can be 
engaged from the outside (8) of the upholstered part (1) to establish a rigid holding 

engagement, characterised in that the receiving members (6) are provided as individual 
spaced-apart receiving members (6) in the basic form of a C-profile on the integrally 

formed synthetic plastics mouldings, the interior of the C-profile having adapted to the 
cross-section of the pull-in bar (11) a receiving space (10) for this while the open side of 

the C-profile is substantially closed by a profiled member (14) adapted to be bendable 
elastically outwardly while being integrally moulded on the open side of the C-shaped 

profile, the outwardly directed profile member (14) having directed towards the outside 
of the upholstered part (1) and diverging from the C-shaped profile a projection (15) 

which forms an insertion mouth for the pull-in rod (11). 
An anchoring strip (2) according to claim 1, characterised in that the base web (5) 
assumes the form of a flat profile orientated crosswise to the longitudinal extension of the 

receiving members (6). 
An anchoring strip (2) according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the base web 
(5) is provided with through bores (9) through which the upholstery material (4) can foam.  

 
An apparatus for the profiled shaping of upholstery materials (4) of foam material 
covered on the outside by a covering material (12) and in the case of upholstery furniture 

and the like upholstered parts (1) such as seat and back rests of chairs, consisting of an 
anchoring strip (2) according to one of claims 1 to 3 and a pull-in bar (11) of synthetic 

plastics material with a separately produced stitch-on tab (13) for the covering material 
(12), characterised in that opposite each area of engagement the stitch-on tab (13) is 

provided with a receiving member (6) with a punched aperture (16) for an adjacent part 
(17) of the receiving member (6).
