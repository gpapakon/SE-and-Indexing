<CLAIMS>
A spinning head for spinning polymer melts having an 
upper part (14) and a nozzle block housing (7) 

having a nozzle plate (9) with a maximum area of 90 
cm
3
 and a melt channel (6) with filter cartridge 
(1),
characterised in that
a single filter cartridge is disposed in the 
direction of flow in front of each nozzle plate (9), 
the filter cartridge (1) consists of a seamless 
metallic cloth cylinder (la), through which the flow 

radially passes from the outside to the inside, 
having an end cap (2a) at the upper end and having 

a downwardly tapering conical connection piece (3) 
with melt passage (4b) at the lower end, 
and the zone (11) of the melt channel receiving the 
filter cartridge, at least in the lower third (llb), 

is constructed as a cone in such a manner that the 
conical connection piece (3) of the filter cartridge 

is pressed in a self-sealing manner into the cone by 
the polymer melt. 
A spinning head according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the ratio of the filter area 
(la) to the area of the nozzle plate (9) is at least 

0.5 : 1. 
A spinning head according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the filter cartridge (1) 
comprises a maximum filter length of 15 cm, and the 

ratio of the filter area (la) to the area of the 
nozzle plate (9) lies in the range of 0.5 : 1 to 2 

: 1.  
 
A spinning head according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the conical connection piece 
(3) corresponds to a taper of 1 : 20 to 1 : 50. 
A spinning head according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the conical connection piece 
(3) corresponds to a taper of 1 : 50. 
A spinning head according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 the filter cartridge has a 
filter mesh of 5 to 20 Âµm and a maximum permissible 

differential pressure of 350 bar. 
A spinning head according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the zone (11) of the melt 

channel receiving the filter cartridge has a conical 
construction in the lower region (llb) and a 

cylindrical construction in the upper region (lla). 
A spinning head according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the zone (11) of the melt 
channel receiving the filter cartridge has a conical 

construction over its entire length. 
A spinning head according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 

characterised in that
 the seamless metallic cloth 
cylinder (1a) of the filter cartridge is electron-beam 

welded on one side with the end cap (2a) and on 
the other side with the conical connection piece 

(3). 
A spinning head according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 

characterised in that
 the nozzle block housing (7) 
is round and is connected to the upper part (14) via 

bolts (12) latchably engaging in slots (13) having 
a curved configuration, and the sealing of the melt  

 
channel (6) at the connecting faces inside the 

nozzle block housing is performed by sleeve seals 
(15), which are expanded in a pressure-tight manner 

by the locking when connected to the upper part.
