<ABSTRACT>
An article is provided for applying a temperature indicating composition (8) on to the surface of a heat recoverable substrate. The article comprises the following four layers: backing layer (2), release layer (4), indicating composition (8), heat-activatable adhesive layer (10). The conversion temperature of the temperature indicating composition (8) is higher than the melting temperature of the release layer (4) and the melting temperature of the release layer (4) is the same as or higher than the activation temperature of the adhesive (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to artides and methods for applying
temperature indicating compositions to heat recoverable artides.Temperature indicating compositions are typically compositions which
change colour on being heated to a typical, usually well-defined, temperature.
The change in colour is frequently reversible and associated with a reversible
chemical change which occurs at that temperature. Such materials are
discussed and reviewed, for example, in two artides by Jess He Day in chem.
Rev. 63, 65 (1963) and Chem. Rev. 68, 649 (1968).Typically temperature indicating compositions are used as warning
indicators that a certain maximum safety temperature has been reached or as
means whereby a subsequent check will reveal that some critical temperature
was attained.One especially interesting application of temperature indicating
compositions has been in the field of heat-recoverable artides. Heat
recoverable articles include heat-shrinkable polymeric sleeve described and
daimed, for example, in US Pat Nos. 2,027,962; 3,086,242; 3,957,372; 3,379,218
and British Pat Nos. 1,155,470; 1,211,988 and 1,346,479, and also heat
recoverable articles based on fabrics as described for example in EP-A-0116393
(MP0790) and EP-A-01176026 (RK176) and EP-A-0116392 (RK178).
These comprise a recoverable fabric in conjunction with a polymeric matrix
formed by laminating a polymeric material to one or both sides of the fabric
to render it impervious. Another type of heat-recoverable artide is described
in British Pat. No. 1,440,524 in which an elastomer member such as an outer
tubular member is "held out" in a stretched state by a second member, such as
an inner tubular member, which upon heating weakens and thus allows the
elastomeric member to recover.These heat-recoverable artides are typically provided with a sealant
coating, for example on the inner surface of a heat-shrinkable sleeve, so that a
seal is made between the sleeve and a substrate such as a pipe or cable when
the sleeve shrinks around it. The sealants are usually mastics or hot-melt
adhesives. In such cases, heat is required both to shrink the sleeve and to
melt the sealant. The heating may be by an externally applied torch or may 
be electrically applied, e.g. by forming the sleeve of a conductive polymeric
material, or by laminating electrical wires in the sleeve, as described for
example in EP - 158519 (B100COM EPC). Whichever heating means is used it
is desirable to ensure that the sleeve does not become too hot to deteriorate it,
and yet, on the other

<CLAIMS>
An article (1) for applying a temperature indicating composition onto the
surface of a heat recoverable substrate (12) comprising:


(i) a backing layer (2),
(ii) a meltable release material (4) mounted on one surface of the
backing layer (2),
(iii) a temperature indicating composition (8), which changes its visual
appearance when heated above a pre-selected temperature T
c
(iv) a heat activatable adhesive layer (10) for bonding the temperature
indicating composition to a surface of a heat recoverable article (12)

wherein the temperature indicating composition is positioned between
the release material (4) and the adhesive layer (10), and wherein T
c
 is higher
than the melting temperature T
m(r1)
 of the release material (4), which is,
in turn, the same as, or higher than the activating temperature T
a(a1)

of the adhesive layer (10).
An article according to claim 1, wherein the release material (4) is in the
form of a continuous layer.
An article according to claim 1 or 2, comprising a protective material (6)
positioned between the temperature indicating composition (8) and the

release material (4).
An article according to claim 3 wherein the protective material (6) is in the
form of a continuous layer.
An article according to any of claims 1-4, wherein T
c
 is at least 10°C
higher than T
m(r1)
. 
An article according to any of claims 1-5, wherein T
m(r1)
 is at least
10°C higher than T
a(a1)
.
A method of applying a temperature indicating composition onto the
surface of a heat recoverable substrate, comprising


(a) positioning an article according to any preceding claim over the
surface of the heat recoverable article (12),
(b) heating the article (1) to a temperature of at least T
a(a1)
 to activate
the adhesive layer (10), and thereby securing the article (1) to the surface of the

heat recoverable substrate (12), then
(c) heating the article (1) to a temperature that is at least as high as
T
m(r1)
 but is lower than T
c
, thereby releasing the backing layer (2) from
the article, but not effecting the change in visual appearance of the

temperature indicating composition (8).
A method according to claim 7 wherein T
a(a1)
 is lower than T
m(r1)
 and
wherein step (b) involves heating the article (1) to a temperature that is at

least as high as T
a(a1)
, but is lower than T
m(r1)
.
A method according to claim 7 or 8, wherein pressure is applied to
urge the article (1) against the substrate (12), simultaneously with, or

subsequent to the heating in step (b).
