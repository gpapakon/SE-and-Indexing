Fibre predominantly made from polyethylene 
terephthalate as the fibre polymer, characterised in 

that it contains 0.1 to 5 wt.%, relative to the fibre 
polymer, of a 50 to 90% imidised polymethacrylic acid 

alkyl ester, predominantly in the form of inclusions. 
Fibre according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
contains 0.1 to 5 wt.%, relative to the fibre polymer, 

of a 50 to 90% imidised polymethyl methacrylate. 
Process for the production of melt-spun fibres 
substantially consisting of polyethylene terephthalate 

by melting the fibre polymer and subsequently spinning 
the melt, characterised in that 0.1 to 5 wt.%, 

relative to the fibre polymer, of a polymer which is 
only partially soluble in the fibre polymer and is 

made of substantially imidised polymethacrylic acid 
alkyl esters, which are 50 to 90% imidised by the 

reaction of polymethacrylic acid alkyl esters, the 
ester group of which contains an alcohol having 1 to 

6 C atoms, with a primary amine with 1 to 3 C atoms, 
and the acid and/or anhydride content of which esters 

is less than 0.25 milliequivalents per g, is mixed 
into the fibre polymer, optionally with further 

additives, prior to melt spinning. 
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that 
0.3 to 1.0 wt.%, relative to the fibre polymer, of the 

imidised polymethacrylic acid alkyl esters are mixed 
into the fibre polymer. 
Process according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that imidised polymethacrylic acid alkyl esters which 

were obtained by imidisation of pure methacrylic 
homopolymers, in particular of pure polymethyl 

methacrylate, with methylamine are mixed into the 
fibre polymer.  

 
Process according to one or more of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that imidised polymethacrylic acid 

alkyl esters with a molecular weight of 50000 to 
300000 are mixed into the fibre polymer. 
Process according to one or more of claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that the fibre polymer is 

polyethylene glycol terephthalate. 
Process according to one or more of claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that pellets of imidised 

polymethacrylic acid alkyl esters are introduced into 
a stream of polyethylene terephthalate pellets 

upstream from the extruder. 
Process according to one or more of claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that a melt of imidised 

polymethacrylic acid alkyl esters is introduced into 
the polyethylene terephthalate melt in the extruder or 

melt lines between the extruder and spinneret and the 
two melts are optionally mixed. 
Process according to one or more of claims 3 to 9, 
characterised in that the polymer is extruded as a 

melt through conventional spinnerets, whereupon the 
filaments solidified from the melt are wound at a 

speed of 500 to 10000 m/min. 
Process according to one or more of claims 3 to 9, 
characterised in that the filaments are wound at 

speeds of up to 8000 m/min in order to produce 
partially oriented yarns.
