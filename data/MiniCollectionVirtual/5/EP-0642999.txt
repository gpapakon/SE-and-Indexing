<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises an introduction channel (51) in which the sheets are stacked on a support (52). Upon selection of the upper sheet (53a), bearing members (66) push the sheets (53) against the entrainment rollers (11) which convey the upper sheet until its front edge enters into contact with a fixed alignment stop (67). After alignment of the sheet, deflector elements (68) bring the front edge towards the entrainment rollers (11) so that the sheet enters into contact with the periphery of these rollers (11) in order to be entrained opposite the writing head. Reliable selection and transportation of the sheets is thus obtained with precise alignment, while the overall size of the device is reduced.

A device for introducing sheets into printers or typewriters including 
a channel (51) for introducing sheets, exhibiting a support (52) 

designed for retaining a pile of sheets (53), drive rollers (11) arranged 
on a drive shaft (12) so as to move the upper sheet (53a) of the 

pile to bring it to face a writing head (6) and an alignment stop (67) 
arranged upstream of the introduction channel (51), characterized in 

that the alignment stop (67) is fastened and arranged in such a manner 
that the upper sheet (53a) be biased in a first phase by the drive rollers 

(11) with its front edge against said alignment stop (67) and at 
least one movable deflector member (68) is designed for cooperating 

with this upper sheet (53a) to remove, in a second phase, its front 
edge from the alignment stopper (67) and to bring this edge to the 

drive rollers (11) in such a manner that the upper sheet (53a) comes in 
contact with the periphery of the drive rollers (11). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that it includes 
movable retractable guide members (60) arranged in said introduction 

channel (51) opposite the support (52) in such a manner as to direct 
the sheets (53) inside retaining corners (56) of this support (52) upon 

insertion of a pile of sheets (53) into the introduction channel (51). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the support 
is provided with movable biasing members (66) designed for biasing 

the sheets (53) against the driving rollers (11) by means of resilient 
rods (93) when the upper sheet (53a) of the pile must be selected to be 

brought opposite the writing head (6).  
 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that it includes movable retractable loading stops (64) arranged close 

to said support (52) and driven in such a manner as to protrude in the 
introduction channel (51) to retain a pile of sheets (53) upon its insertion 

into the channel and in such a manner as to be retracted upon 
the displacement of the upper sheet (53a) towards the wr
iting head (6). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that it includes a control shaft (13) running parallel to the drive 

shaft (12) of the rollers (11) and having first cams (78) designed for 
controlling the motion of the movable deflector member (68). 
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the drive 
shaft (12) of the rollers (11) and the control shaft (13) are connected 

to a single motor (10) capable of rotating in both directions, the 
drive shaft (12) being provided with a unidirectional coupling arranged 

in such a manner as to be engaged with the motor (10) in a first direction 
of rotation of this motor and the control shaft (13) being provided 

with a second unidirectional coupling arranged in such a manner as 
to be engaged with the motor (10) in the second direction of rotation 

of this motor. 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that the control 
shaft further includes respectively second and third cams (91, 100) arranged 

in such a manner as to control the forward motion of the movable 
guide members (60), respectively of the movable loading stops (64), in 

the introduction channel (51), to facilitate the insertion of the 
sheets into the introduction channel (51) and the retraction of these 

guide members (60), respectively of these loading stops (64), upon the  
 

displacement of the upper sheet towards the writing head (6), fourth 
cams (94) arranged in such a manner as to control the forward motion of 

the movable basing members (66) under the action of resilient members 
(93) for the displacement of the upper sheet selected and the retraction 

of these members (66) against the action of said resilient members 
(93) when the displacement of the upper selected sheet is finished. 
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that it includes 
control members (14) arranged in such a manner as to control, during a 

displacement cycle of the upper sheet (53a) towards the writing head 
(6) 


in a first phase of the cycle, a rotation of the motor (10) in said 
second direction to produce the forward motion of the biasing members 

(66) by means of the fourth cams (94), to bias the upper sheet against 
the drive rollers (11) and the retraction of the guide members (60) and 

of the loading stops (64), by means of the second and fourth cams (91, 
100), 
in a second phase of the cycle, a rotation in the first direction to 
produce the driving motion of the rollers (11) and the displacement of 

the upper sheet (53a) in such a manner as to bias the same by its upper 
edge against the alignment stop (67),
