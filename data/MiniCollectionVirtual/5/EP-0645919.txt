<ABSTRACT>
For the transmission of message cells via virtual path pairs in each case formed from two separate paths (AP, EP), it is provided that each received message cell for each of the paths of a path pair is prefixed with a separate internal cell header at least by a coupling device (CCa) located at the start of the respective path pair. These internal cell headers have a number of header parts which corresponds to the number of coupling stages of the respective coupling device. When a message cell occurs, the header parts of the internal header cells which determine the respective coupling stage and which are allocated to one another are compared with one another by each of the coupling stages of the respective coupling device (CCa). Depending on the result of the comparison, the message cell concerned is then either forwarded unchanged or is duplicated. The two resulting message cells are then forwarded via separate paths within the respective coupling device according to the relevant header parts of the two internal cell headers.
