<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid circuit structure (110) that includes a metal
substrate (112), an inorganic electrical insulator layer (120) and at

least one inorganic thick-film passive circuit element (114,116,118),

such as a thick-film resistor (116), capacitor (118) or conductor (114).
An interface layer (122) is provided between the insulator layer (120)

and the circuit element (114,116,118) to prevent the detrimental
effects of interlayer diffusion. The composition of the interface layer

(122) is selected to prevent the diffusion of constituents from the
inorganic insulator layer (426), and to have a CTE near that of the

circuit element (114,116,118) to reduce thermal fatigue. As a result,
the passive circuit element (114,116,118) can be formed of essentially

any one of a number of conventional inorganic thick-film materials
that are widely used on alumina substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to thick-film
materials and processes. More particularly, this invention relates to
a thick-film hybrid circuit structure processed on a metal substrate,
wherein the circuit structure includes inorganic thick-film passive
circuit elements, a dielectric insulator layer that electrically
insulates the passive devices from the steel substrate, and a barrier
layer that prevents diffusion from the insulator layer into the circuit
elements.Insulated metal substrates have been used in the
fabrication of electronic circuits to yield circuit board structures with
thermal resistances lower than circuits formed on conventional
alumina substrates. Typical metal substrate materials include steel,
clad metal and aluminum alloys. Electrical insulation of metal
substrates has been achieved using inorganic insulator coatings
formed from such materials as porcelain enamels and glass
dielectrics, and organic insulator coatings formed from such
materials as KAPTON®, TEFLON®, acrylics, epoxies and phenolic
polymers filled with ceramics.Porcelain insulator coatings are fired at temperatures
sufficiently high (e.g., about 600°C to about 900°C) to allow printing
and firing of inorganic thick-film resistive, dielectric and conductive
inks to form thick-film passive circuit devices and conductors. While
effective in electrically insulating thick-film circuit elements from
metal substrates, porcelain enamel coatings have coefficients of
thermal expansion (CTEs) higher than conventional inorganic thick-film
materials, which if not compensated for promotes thermal
fatigue. (As used herein, the term "conventional inorganic thick-film
materials" are those resistive, dielectric and conductive materials
designed for use on alumina (e.g., 96%) substrates and characterized 
by sufficient process insensitivity, consistency, predictability and
power dissipation to be suitable for high-volume applications, such as
automotive electronic applications. Conventional inorganic thick-film
resistive materials are also understood by this definition to have
sheet resistances of up to at least 100 kilo-ohms/square.) To avoid a
CTE mismatch, inorganic thick-film circuit elements formed on
porcelain insulator coatings have been specifically formulated to be
compatible with the particular porcelain material used for the
insulator coating. Materials for inorganic thick-film circuit elements
formed on porcelain insulator coatings must also tolerate the
diffusion of constituents from these coatings, which would
