<ABSTRACT>
An instrument for characterizing tumor tissue 
includes a broad-band light source (10), a monochromator (12) for 

filtering collimated light from the broad-band light source, 
a scanner for scanning the monochromator through a range 

of predetermined wavelengths, and a hollow needle (20) 
including a shaft (30) with a tip (32) on one end and a base (34) on the 

other end. An optical fiber (14) is positioned within the hollow 
needle for delivering light from the monochromator through 

the tip to a desired tissue region. A photodiode (24) is mounted 
in the shaft and has a light sensitive surface facin
g 
outward from the shaft for detecting back-scattered light 

from the tissue region. The back-scattered light detected 
by the photodiode is monitored by a computer (36) which records 

the optical absorption spectrum of light back-scattered 
from the tissue region at discrete locations in the tissue as 

the needle is inserted or withdrawn through the 
mammographically abnormal tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an instrument for
diagnosing cancer, and, more particularly, to a hollow
needle, including a fiber optic illuminator and a photodiode,
for insertion into breast tissue to detect and analyze shifts
in hemoglobin oxygenation.In a conventional procedure, a radiologist performs x-ray
mammography. If an abnormal breast process recorded
on the resulting mammograms is considered suspicious, a
surgical biopsy can be ordered. Immediately prior to the
biopsy, the radiologist takes several more views or
projections of the breast during preoperative localization
of the abnormality and marks the location of the suspicious
abnormality by impaling the region with a thin, hooked guide
wire. The patient is then taken to an operating room and a
surgeon performing the biopsy follows the hooked wire
guide to the precise location of the suspected abnormality.
The most common form of biopsy involves surgically
removing the suspected region. One of the less invasive
forms of biopsy, stereotactic fine needle aspiration biopsy,
aspirates a small amount of cells for cytologic analysis.
The advantages of this technique are that it is minimally
invasive, is accurate to less than 2 mm in lesion
localization, has a sensitivity greater than 90%, and is less
expensive than surgical biopsies. But since small (22
gauge) needles are used, cytology on the small amount of
material removed is not easy. Far more accurate is large-core
needle biopsy (using stereotactic positioning or 
ultrasound guidance), another alternative to surgical biopsy.
Core biopsies remove a 1 mm x 17 mm core of tissue (if a
14 gauge needle is used) for standard histological
examination. However, benign histological diagnoses are
difficult to make. In fact, for both fine needle aspiration
biopsy and core biopsy, the techniques are only useful when
they return a positive result for malignancy. In all other
cases, the suspicious lesion must undergo incisional or
excisional surgical biopsy.False negatives in analyzing an x-ray mammogram
occur when benign tumors or "normal" breast tissue with
radiological densities similar to cancer completely or
partially mask a malignant tumor which does not exhibit
primary or secondary mammographic signs of carcinoma.
False positives are also problematic because they reduce
the acceptability of mammography by the general public and
lead to unnecessary biopsies.Attempts have been made to use fibers to study
biochemical and hemodynamic processes in tissues and to
determine tissue type by using
