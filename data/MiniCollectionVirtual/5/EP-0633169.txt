<ABSTRACT>
The articulated support is noteworthy in that it comprises a base (10) which can receive a retractor ( epsilon ) and which is mounted so that it can move relative to the back (D) between a normal active position and an inactive tilted position, an articulation (20) connecting the back and the base in order to allow the latter to tilt, a bolt (30) which is partly carried by this base and partly carried by the passenger compartment (H) of the vehicle and which can be moved between a locked position in which both the back is held normally upright and the retractor can operate normally, and another position, an elastic stressing member (40) for tending normally to place the bolt in its locked position, and a control device (50) for placing the bolt in this other position and the base in its tilted position against this elastic stress action so as to make it possible to fold the normally upright back with respect to the seat. Application to motor vehicle rear seats.

Support for a safety belt strap winding device (E) to 
be mounted on a movable seat back (D) which is 

normally erect and may be folded down to face the 
seating surface of a seat intended for positioning in 

the passenger module (H) of a land motor vehicle, 
characterised in that said support is articulated and 

comprises a base section (10), which is capable of 
receiving this winding device (E) and is mounted to 

move relative to the seat back (D) between an active 
normal position and an inactive tilted position, an 

articulation (20) connecting this seat back (D) and 
this base section (10) to allow the latter (10) to 

tilt, a bolt (30) supported partially by this base 
section (10) and partially by said passenger module 

(H), and which is movable between a locked position, 
in which the seat back (D) is held in a normally erect 

position and at the same time the winding device (E) 
is capable of functioning normally, and another 

position, a flexible stressing means (40) for 
endeavouring to normally place the bolt (30) in its 

locked position, and an operating device (50) for 
placing the bolt (30) in its other position and the 

base section (10) in its tilted position against the 
action of this flexible stressing means (40) to enable 

the normally erect seat back (D) to be folded down to 
face the seating surface. 
Support according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the base section (10) comprises a base (11) which is 

able to receive a winding device (E) and at least one 
wing (12) which is coupled to the articulation (20) 

which supports part of the bolt (30) and is connected  
 

to the operating means (50). 
Support according to Claim 1 or 2 for a seat, the back 
(D) of which has a reinforcement (O), characterised in 

that the articulation (20) comprises an axis (21) 
fixed to the reinforcement (O) of the seat back (D) 

and at least one bearing (22) supported by a wing (12) 
of the base section (10). 
Support according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the bolt (30) comprises a fixed 

latch (31) attached to the passenger module (H) and a 
locking bar (32) supported by the base section (10) 

and movable between the locked position and this other 
position. 
Support according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the locking bar (32) is an integral part of the wing 

(12) of the base section (10) and is constructed in 
the form of a hook (321) with a ramp section (322) 

enabling them both to cooperate with the latch (31). 
Support according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the flexible stressing means 

(40) is provided by a spring which abuts against the 
base section (10) and against the operating device 

(50). 
Support according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the operating device (50) 

comprises an operating lever (51) and a link (52) 
positioned between this lever (51) and the base 

section (10).  
 
Support according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
lever (51) comprises a rod (511) and a small rod 

(512), both of which are fixed in rotation on a pivot 
(510) mounted to freely rotate on the seat back (D), 

in particular on its reinforcement (O). 
Support according to either of Claims 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the link (52) comprises a cam 

(521) which is supported by the base section (10) and 
a cam follower (522) which cooperates with this cam 

(521) and is supported by this small rod (512). 
Use of a support in accordance with any one of Claims 
1 to 9 for a fold-down back of a se
at, in particular a 
rear seat.
