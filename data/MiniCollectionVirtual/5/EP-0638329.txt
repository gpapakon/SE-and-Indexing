<ABSTRACT>
A medical device comprising a voltage source arranged in a housing and a pulse generator circuit for generation of electrical voltage pulses is created for treating urinary incontinence. This medical device permits simple application, which is safe over prolonged periods, for the purpose of stimulating fairly large muscle and nerve regions. For this purpose, it is intended that the housing of the device be composed of several parts, at least one of which has a reception chamber for the voltage source. Another reception chamber houses the pulse generator circuit and a Reed contact as operating switch. This is provided in the connection line between the voltage source and the pulse generator circuit and is closed in the resting position. The device is furthermore equipped with three electrodes emitting the voltage pulses. One of these electrodes is designed as a positive pole and two mutually connected electrodes are designed as negative poles. A magnet for opening of the Reed contact is arranged in a container for storage of the device when the latter is not in use.
