<ABSTRACT>
A two stage liquid ring vacuum pump having a selectively variable flow rate 
of service liquid through a first stage and a second stage. The flow rate through the 

second stage is reduced by venting service liquid from the second stage prior to 
normal passage through a discharge port. The vented service liquid is introduced in 

the first stage to enhance the pumping capacity of the first stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid ring vacuum pumps, and more
particularly, to varying the flow rate and the volume of a service liquid in the stages
of a two stage liquid ring vacuum pump.Liquid ring vacuum pumps are well known and widely used in industrial
applications for a smooth nonpulsating gas or vapor removal. The working parts of
a liquid ring vacuum pump include a multi-bladed impeller eccentrically mounted in
a cylindrical casing which is partially filled with a service liquid. As the impeller
rotates, the liquid is thrown by centrifugal force to form a liquid ring which is
concentric with the periphery of the casing. Due to the eccentric positioning of the
impeller relative to the casing and the liquid ring, the spaces or cells between
adjacent impeller blades are cyclically filled and emptied with the service liquid as
the impeller rotates. During rotation of the impeller any air or gas trapped in the cell
is compressed and discharged from the casing through an outlet port leaving the cell
available to receive air or gas which is presented to the suction port of the casing.Two stage liquid ring vacuum pumps are used in applications requiring
relatively high vacuums. The two stage liquid ring vacuum pump can produce and
efficiently maintain suction pressures from 150 to 25 mm Hg absolute. A two stage
liquid ring vacuum pump has two impellers working in series on a volumetric ratio
which can be as high as 3:1, first stage to second stage. The impellers are affixed to
a common shaft and are rotated at the same rotational speed. The two stages can
accommodate a greater capacity at lower absolute suction pressures than a single
stage of compression. However, two stage liquid ring vacuum pumps exhibit the
inherent problem of lower capacity at high absolute suction pressures.To maximize efficiency, the desired operating parameters and required
system component sizes must be matched for a given two stage liquid ring vacuum
pump. However, the relatively large range of operating parameters forces trade offs
in matching component capabilities. That is, some individual components may not
be maximized in view of trade offs with other components at certain operating
conditions.Two stage liquid ring vacuum pumps are well suited for efficiently and
reliably maintaining the low absolute pressure at the holding point. However, the
two stage liquid ring vacuum pumps require a substantial period of time to 
completely evacuate a vessel. In fact, evacuation with a
two stage liquid ring vacuum pump is
