<ABSTRACT>
An impact damping element (10) is provided including an annular bumper portion (12) and a seal portion surrounding the bumper portion for engaging an inner wall of a cylinder (60) in sealing contact. The impact damping element (10) is adapted to absorb the impact between a piston (50) and the end of a cylinder wall. In one embodiment of the invention, a primary (12) and a secondary bumper (14) are provided wherein the primary bumper (12) has a greater height than the secondary bumper (14) such that the primary bumper absorbs an initial impact between the piston (50) and the cylinder wall and the secondary bumper (14) absorbs the remaining force to prevent direct contact between the piston and the cylinder wall. The materials forming the seal portion (16) and the bumper portion (12) are preferably co-molded together such that the impact element is formed as an integral unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPACT DAMPING MEANS FOR POWER CYLINDERS Background Of The Invention This invention relates to a damping or absorbing element for absorbing the impact of pistons upon the ends of a power cylinder. More specifically, this invention relates to an impact damping element positioned on the ends of the cylinder or the facing surfaces of the piston for absorbing the impact of the piston against the cylinder end and preventing the piston from directly engaging the ends of the cylinder.Generally, there are various types of impact elements used to dampen the impact of a piston against the ends of a cylinder at the end of each piston stroke in order to reduce the noise which may result from metal- to-metal contact as the piston engages the cylinder ends. U.S. Patent 3,913,460, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a damping or cushioning piston impact element in the form of a contoured impact ring. The ring incorporates a resilient bumper portion and a resilient sealing lip. The sealing lip entraps the cylinder fluid between the. piston and the cylinder end at the end of the' piston stroke to provide an initial slowing of the piston as the piston approaches the end of the cylinder. The main impact damping effects of the impact element described in the '460 patent are performed by the bumper portion of the impact ring. As the piston moves into close proximity to one of the cylinder end walls, the bumper portion is compressed between the piston and the cylinder end wall such that the bumper portion absorbs the energy of the impact. The bumper is designed such that under normal operating conditions, the piston will not engage the cylinder end.As the velocity of the piston within the cylinder is increased or the weight of any element actuated by the piston is increased, resulting in increased kinetic energy, the load exerted on the bumper 

portion will also increase such that under certain extreme operating conditions, the bumper portion may compress sufficiently to permit metal-to-metal contact between the piston and the cylinder end. This contact between the piston and cylinder typically produces undesirable noise which the impact damping element is intended to prevent.Conventional bumpers, such as the one described in the above referenced U.S. patent, are typically formed of a single homogeneous material such that the material characteristics of the sealing lip are the same as the material characteristics of the resilient bumper portion. Unfortunately, the material characteristics which are

 CLAIMS:
1. An impact damping element for use with a power cylinder having a piston positioned for reciprocating movement within a cylinder having opposing cylinder ends, said element being adapted to be mounted within said cylinder to cushion impact forces between said piston and said cylinder ends, said element including a bumper portion for forming a cushioning element between said piston and one of said cylinder ends and a seal portion for engaging a surface of said power cylinder in sliding and sealing contact, wherein said element is characterized by: said bumper portion and said seal portion being formed integrally with each other and having different material characteristics.
2. The element as in claim 1 wherein said bumper portion and said seal portion are formed of different materials.
3. The element as in claim 2 wherein said material forming said bumper portion is blended into said material forming said seal portion.
4. The element as in claim 1 wherein the material forming said bumper portion has greater rebound characteristics than the material forming said seal portion.
5. The element as in claim 1 wherein the material forming said bumper portion has a greater capacity for dissipating impact energy than the material forming said seal portion.
6. The element as in claim 1 wherein said bumper portion and said seal portion are formed of a common material and said seal portion includes a friction reducing additive not present in said bumper portion. 


7. The element as in claim 1 wherein said bumper portion and said seal portion are formed as annular members and said element includes a flange portion extending radially inwardly for mounting said element to said piston.
8. The element as in claim 1 wherein said bumper portion is formed as an annular member of a first material extending to a first height and said bumper portion includes a second material extending to a second height less than said first height.
9. The element as in claim 8 wherein said second material is formed as discrete land members circumferentially spaced on said bumper portion.
10. The element as in claim 1 wherein said bumper portion and said seal portion have multiple durometer hardnesses.
11. The element as in claim 1 wherein said bumper portion has a different durometer hardness than said seal portion.
12. The element as in claim 11 wherein said bumper portion and said seal portion are made of the same material.
13. The element as in claim 11 wherein said bumper portion and said seal portion are made from different materials. 


14. Impact damping means for use with a power cylinder having a cylinder housing defining opposing first and second end faces and a piston having opposing first and second end surfaces movable between and into close proximity with respective ones of said first and second end faces, said impact damping means having a body portion defining a facing surface and forming an impact absorbing element between said end surfaces and said end faces, wherein said impact damping means is characterized by: a primary bumper portion extending from said facing surface a first distance in a direction substantially perpendicular to said facing surface; a secondary bumper portion extending from said facing surface a second distance less than said first distance in a direction substantially parallel to said primary bumper portion; and wherein said primary and secondary bumper portions are formed as impact absorbing elements for preventing contact between said end surfaces and said end faces during movement of said piston toward said end faces.
15. The impact damping means as in claim 14, wherein said primary bumper portion is more compressible than said secondary bumper portion.
16. The impact damping means as in claim 14, including an annular seal portion radially spaced from said primary and secondary bumper portions.
