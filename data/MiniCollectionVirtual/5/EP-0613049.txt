<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is described for the processing of sheet material. The 
apparatus comprises a tank (10) and at least one removable rack (12) 

located in said tank (10). Each rack (12) has opposite side plates 
(14a, 14b). At least one pair of guide rollers (16, 18, 20) define 

a transport path (15) for the sheet material. Liquid inlet openings 
(24a, 24b) are included in one side plate (14a), and liquid outlet 

openings (26a, 26b) are included in the opposite side plate (14b). 
A pump (28) feeds processing liquid to the liquid inlet openings 

(24a, 24b) to circulate the processing liquid under pressure of the 
pump through the rack (12). The liquid inlet and liquid outlet 

openings (24a,24b, 26a, 26b) being so positioned to provide a 
circulating flow of the processing liquid closely adjacent the 

surface of the sheet material across the transport path (15) in a 
direction parallel to the guide rollers (16, 18, 20). The output 

side (30) of the pump (28) is in liquid communication with an 
upwardly facing connection port (34). The rack (12) includes pipe-work 

(32) leading from the liquid inlet opening (24a, 24b) to a 
downwardly directed pipe end (36), engageable in the upwardly 

facing connection port (34). The apparatus provides good 
circulation without the use of high flow-rate pumps and without the 

use of rinsing chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for the processing
of sheet material, in particular film or other photo-chemical
material. In such a process the sheet material is brought into
contact with aqueous processing liquids, and rinsing water in a
processing machine.The reaction between the sheet material and the processing liquid
takes place in a thin reaction zone or layer of the liquid close to
the surface of the sheet material. As the reaction proceeds, active
chemicals in the reaction zone become used up and this zone becomes
saturated with reaction products. It is necessary for fresh active
chemicals to diffuse into this zone from the bulk of the liquid and
for the reaction products to diffuse away. To achieve this
continuous refreshment of the reaction zone, circulation of the
processing liquid is often employed.In a known processing machine there is an open-topped tank divided
into a number of compartments, in each of which is located a
removable rack. Each rack has opposite side plates carrying at
least one pair of guide rollers to define a transport path for the
sheet material. A number of liquid inlet openings are provided in
one side plate, and a number of liquid outlet openings are provided
in the opposite side plate. The side plates of the rack are spaced
from the sides of the tank to form there-between a liquid inlet well
on one side and a liquid outlet well on the other. A pump feeds
processing liquid to the liquid inlet well and withdraws processing
liquid from the outlet well. Processing liquid circulates through
the rack under pressure of the small liquid head in the inlet well.There is a need for a variety of reasons to employ processing
apparatus which is as small as possible and which uses as small a
volume of processing liquid as possible. Thus while volumes of
processing liquid such as 24 l/m2 of sheet material were used in
earlier devices, volumes as low as 0.25 l/m2 are now desirable,
generating a need for even more effective refreshment of the 
reaction zone. While this may be achieved by increasing circulation
rates, it is essential that the refreshment of the reaction zone is
as uniform as possible over the width of the sheet, otherwise
inconsistent processing results. If, in the type of processing
apparatus referred to above, the pump pressure was to be increased,
high flow rates through the rack might be achieved, but not without
the generation of turbulence. Too much turbulence, and/or the
generation of waves can lead to overflowing of liquid from the tank.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the processing of sheet material, comprising a
tank (10) and at least one removable rack (12) located in said tank

(10), each rack (12) having opposite side plates (14a, 14b), means
defining a transport path (15) for the sheet material including at

least one pair of guide rollers (16, 18, 20) carried by said side plates,
a liquid inlet opening (24a, 24b) in one side plate (14a), a liquid outlet opening (26a,

26b) in the opposite side plate (14b), and a pump (28) for feeding
processing liquid to and from the tank (10) to circulate the

processing liquid through the rack (12), the output side (30) of the
pump (28) being in liquid communication with the liquid inlet

opening (24a, 24b) to feed processing liquid under pressure of the
pump (28) into the rack (12), wherein the liquid inlet

and liquid outlet openings (24a, 24b, 26a, 26b) are positioned only
proximate said transport path (15) so that a circulating flow of the

processing liquid is provided closely adjacent the surface of the
sheet material across said transport path (15) in a direction

parallel to the guide rollers (16, 18, 20).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the transport path
(15) is further defined by one or more guide plates (14a, 14b).
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the transport
path (15) is further defined by at least a second pair of guide

rollers (16, 18, 20).
