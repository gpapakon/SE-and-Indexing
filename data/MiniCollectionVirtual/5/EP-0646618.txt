<ABSTRACT>
In the preparation of organopolysiloxane microemulsions, the components     A) organopolysiloxane,   B) emulsifier,   C) water, optionally   D) cosurfactant and optionally   E) acid are combined and mixed in any desired sequence. Microemulsions form spontaneously without the input of energy in the form of heat or strong shear forces.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of organopolysiloxane 
microemulsions, in which the components 


A) organopolysiloxane in amounts of from 10 to 40% by 
weight, based on the total weight of the microemulsions, 
B) at least one emulsifier which contains diethylene 
glycol monobutyl ether, 
C) water, if appropriate 
D) cosurfactant and if appropriate 
E) acid. 
 
are brought together and mixed in any desired sequence, 

with the proviso that the introduction of energy in the 
form of strong shear forces and heat is not necessary. 
Process according to Claim 1, where the 
organopolysiloxanes A employed are organopolysiloxanes of 

the general formula (I) 

R

wherein 


the Rs
are identical or different, optionally substituted 
hydrocarbon radicals or hydrocarbonoxy 

radicals having in each case 1 to 18 carbon 
atoms, 
the R's
are identical or different Si-C-bonded substituted 
hydrocarbon radicals containing polar 

groups, or hydroxyl groups, 
n
is an integer having a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3 and 
m
is an integer having a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3, 
 
and the sum of n+m has an average value of 1.8 to 2.2 and 

m is chosen such that the polyorganosiloxane contains at 
least one radical R'. 
Process according to Claim 2, where the R's are 
radicals of the general formula (II)

Organopolysiloxane microemulsions which comprise 
the components 


A) organopolysiloxane in amounts of from 10 to 40% by 
weight, based on the total weight of the microemulsions, 
B) at least one emulsifier which contains diethylene 
glycol monobutyl ether, 
C) water, if appropriate 
D) cosurfactant and if appropriate 
E) acid. 
Use of the organopolysiloxane microemulsions 
according to Claim 4 or prepared according to one of 

Claims 1 to 3 as agents or in compositions for 
impregnating and coating textile fibres and textile 

fabrics.
