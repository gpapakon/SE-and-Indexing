<ABSTRACT>
Two chitinases from (Trichoderma harzanium) P1 (ATCC 74058) show chitin-containing-fungus-inhibiting activity. One is an endochitinase and the other is a chitobiase. Both have molecular weights of 40 kDa and isoelectric points of 3.9. A (lambda)gtll recombinant encoding for the endochitinase has been prepared (ATCC 55338) and the gene encoding for the endochitinase has been removed from the DNA of the recombinant by the restriction enzyme, (Not) I. Endochitinases and chitobiases including the two purified from (Trichoderma harzanium) strain P1 demonstrate synergy with each other in anti-fungal effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PURIFIED CHITINASES AND USE THEREOFThis invention was made in part with Government support under U.S.-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) grant number US-1723-89. The Government has certain rights in the invention. Gross-Reference to Related ApplicationThis is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/716,134, filed June 17, 1991. Technical FieldThis invention is directed to isolation of chitinases for biological control of chitin- containing fungi and insects. Background of the InventionApplication of broad-spectrum pesticides is the primary method used for controlling fungal and insect pests. Such application has resulted in significant environmental pollution and ecological disruption. Pesticide residues are found in food and groundwater and often eliminate beneficial organisms resulting in emergence of secondary pests. Furthermore, as the target pests become less susceptible to the pesticide, there can be a resurgence of the original pest, requiring application of excessive quantities of pesticides for control.A number of strategies for biological or biorational control of fungal and insect pests have been envisioned. Among the more attractive strategies are those that target an attribute that is pest specific. One target that has been selected is the structural polymer chitin, which is present in insects and some fungi that attack plants, but is absent in higher plants and vertebrates. U.S. Patent No. 4,751,081 follows 

this approach and is directed to novel chitinase- producing bacteria strains for use for inhibiting chitinase-sensitive plant pathogens (fungi and nematodes) . The approach of U.S. 4,751,081 lacks flexibility.Summary of the InventionAn object of the invention herein is to provide purified chitinases which can be used per se to inhibit fungi and insects that contain chitin or can be used to provide novel chitinase- producing bacteria as in U.S. Patent No. 4,751,081 or can be used to isolate genes coding for them which can be inserted into a genome of a plant needing protection from a chitin-containing pest.The chitinases that are the subject of the instant invention are isolated from Trichoderma harzianum strain PI. This strain was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852 on May 20, 1991, under the terms of the Budapest Treaty, and has been assigned accession number ATCC 74058.The chitinases herein inhibit chitin- containing fungi and insects.One chitinase herein is an essentially pure protein
