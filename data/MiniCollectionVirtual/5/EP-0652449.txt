<ABSTRACT>
A well logging tool in accordance with the present
invention is provided for emitting neutron bursts, and

determining inelastic energy spectra and thermal neutron
capture cross sections during a single logging pass over a

well depth interval. Inelastic energy spectra are
determined, in part, by measuring exponential decay rates

for thermal neutrons capture events that occur during decay
periods which extend for at least several thermal neutron

lifetimes following each of the neutron bursts, and by
using the measured exponential decay rates to project from

thermal neutron capture spectra detected during the decay
periods a value for thermal neutron capture components of

the total energy spectra detected during neutron burst
periods.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a well logging tool and a method for logging a well by
emitting a series of neutron bursts into a formation and
detecting gamma radiation emitted by the formation in
response to the neutron bursts, and in particular, to a
well logging tool for measuring inelastic energy spectra of
the resultant gamma radiation. Prior art well logging tools have been used for
emitting pulses of fast neutrons and detecting a resultant
gamma radiation from a formation. Fast neutrons are
generated in pulses, or bursts, of neutron emissions and
typically have an initial energy level of 14 MeV. The
detected resultant gamma radiation is utilized to
determine various formation parameters, such as porosity,
lithology, water saturation, and hydrocarbon saturation.These prior art well logging tools are typically
operated in either a sigma logging mode or a spectroscopy
logging mode. Prior art well logging tools which are
operated in the sigma logging mode have been used during
the last thirty years for logging wells to determine
thermal neutron capture cross sections, or sigma, for
formations. During the last twenty years, prior art well
logging tools which are operated in the spectroscopy
logging mode have been developed for measuring inelastic
energy spectra for the gamma rays which are emitted as a
result of inelastic collisions between the fast neutrons
and formation nuclei.The inelastic energy spectra measured during a
spectroscopy logging mode contain signature energy peaks
which may be processed to determine the relative amounts of
particular types of nuclei included within a formation.
For example, when nuclei of carbon and oxygen are impacted
by fast neutrons having energy levels which range from 5
MeV to 14 MeV, or greater, gamma radiation having gamma
rays at discrete energy levels are emitted as a result of
the impacts, or collisions. These discrete energy levels
of emitted gamma rays are different for nuclei of carbon 
than for nuclei of oxygen, providing signature peaks in the
detected energy spectra for a formation interval.Prior art logging tool detectors have been used for
measuring inelastic spectra to determine the relative
amounts of these discrete energy levels from gamma
radiation energy spectrum data samples. Although these
discrete energy levels are "smeared" together by compton
scattering and the response characteristics of logging tool
detector means, they still may be used to provide
characteristics of the formation, such as, for example, a
Carbon/Oxygen ratio, or "C/O" ratio.
