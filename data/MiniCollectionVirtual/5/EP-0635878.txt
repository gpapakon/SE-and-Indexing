<ABSTRACT>
In a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, a 
metal film (7) comprising a predetermined metal element is 

formed on a wiring base layer by ion beam assisted CVD, more 
specifically, by selectively irradiating a predetermined 

region of the wiring base layer with focused ion beam (4) 
while blowing organic metal gas (6) containing the 

predetermined metal element onto the region irradiated with 
the ion beam (4). Thereafter, a low-resistance metal layer 

(9) is formed on the metal film (7) by electroless plating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a semiconductor device, a method of restoring 
a wiring pattern, and a method of changing a wiring pattern 
and, more particularly, to a method of forming a metal 
wiring with a predetermined pattern without using a mask for 
patterning a metal layer. Figs. 5(a)-5(e) are sectional views showing an example 
of a wiring forming method used in the conventional 
manufacturing method of a semiconductor device, and Figs. 
6(a)-6(f) are sectional views showing photolithographic 
process in the wiring forming method. A semiconductor 
substrate 1 may comprise any material, such as Si or GaAs, 
if it is normally used in a semiconductor device. A metal 
film 2a is formed on the semiconductor substrate 1. A metal 
wiring 2 (referred to as a wiring hereinafter) with a 
predetermined pattern is formed by patterning the metal 
film. A resist mask 3a is used in patterning of the metal 
film 2a. In addition, a liquid resist 3a is dropped on the metal 
film 2a on the semiconductor substrate 1. A liquid resist 
3b is spread over the entire surface of the metal film 2a. 
A resist film 3c is formed by baking the liquid resist in  
 
heat treatment. A resist film 3d is formed by performing 
exposure process onto the resist film 3c. A resist mask 3 
with a predetermined pattern is formed by developing the 
exposed resist film 3d with developing solution 13. Figs. 7, 8(a)-8(c), 9, 10, 11, and 12 are schematic 
views showing structures of several processing apparatuses, 
such as a sputtering apparatus or a resist applying 
apparatus, used in steps of the wiring forming method. As shown in Fig. 7, a sputtering apparatus 210 
comprises a substrate table 211 on which the semiconductor 
substrate 1 is set, a sputtering source 213 generating 
sputtering particles 213a toward the surface of the 
semiconductor substrate 1, and an electron gun 212 emitting, 
for example, electron beams toward the sputtering source 
213. As shown in Fig. 8(a), a resist applying apparatus 220 
comprises a wafer carried-in portion 220a provided on one 
end of the apparatus body, a resist applying portion 220b 
provided in the center of the apparatus body, and a baking 
portion 220c provided on the other end of the apparatus 
body. As shown in Fig. 8(b), a rotating table 221b on which 
the semiconductor substrate 1 is set is provided at the 
resist applying portion 220b. Above the rotating table 
221b, there is provided a nozzle 222b for dropping the  
 
liquid resist 3a onto the semiconductor
