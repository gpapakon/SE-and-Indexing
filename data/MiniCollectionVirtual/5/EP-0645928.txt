<ABSTRACT>
A microcomputer (48) reads out cassette management 
information from an IC memory (51) on a cassette to give the 

same to a D-IF formatter (49). The D-IF formatter outputs 
the cassette management information by a digital interface 

format which packages a reproducing digital image 
and audio signals from an error correction circuit (35), and 

a sub-code and the cassette management information. 
Upon dubbing recording, a separation circuit (47) extracts 

the cassette management information from dubbing input 
to give the same to the microcomputer. The microcomputer 

creates the cassette management information 
corresponding to a program to be dubbed, on the basis 

of the inputted cassette management information, to 
store the same into the IC memory. In this manner, 

upon dubbing, the image and audio information is recorded 
on a tape, and the cassette management information 

is automatically recorded on the IC memory. Thus, 
complicated information input of a user is dispensed 

with.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
information-signal recording apparatus, an information-signal 
reproducing apparatus and an information-signal 
recording and reproducing apparatus, which are capable 
of performing dubbing. In recent years, a cassette management system 
has been developed in which the contents of a plurality 
of programs which are recorded in a cassette video tape 
are automatically displayed on a television image plane 
or a cassette body. A VTR (video tape recorder) which 
loads this system has also been merchandised. When a 
library of the cassette video tapes increases, it 
becomes difficult to grasp in how cassette tapes a 
desired program is stored, and the recorded position. 
The cassette management system displays management 
information every recording, to thereby facilitate 
retrieval operation of a user. Various methods have been considered as the 
cassette management system. For example, there is a 
method in which a non-volatile memory is provided in a 
VTR body, and the contents thereof are stored  
 
correspondingly to numbers of all the cassettes. 
However, in case where there are many in number the 
cassettes to be managed, the memory capacity required 
increases. Accordingly, a method which has a recording 
medium on the side of the cassette is normally adopted 
as one for public welfare. For example, there are a 
method in which exclusive or dedicated bar code labels 
are stuck to the cassettes, a method in which the IC 
memory is attached to the cassettes, and the like. Fig. 11 is an explanatory view showing an 
example of the former. As shown in Fig. 11, a cassette deck body 1 
is provided with a bar code reading writing section 2. 
When the cassette tape is loaded, a label 5 which is 
stuck onto a cassette 3 is opposed against the bar code 
reading writing section 2, and a bar code 4 on the 
label 5 is read by the bar code reading writing section 
2. Cassette management information is recorded by the 
bar code 4. The cassette management information is 
displayed on, for example, an image plane on the basis 
of a signal from the bar code reading writing section 
2. The bar code reading writing section 2 can 
also record cassette management information upon a 
loading state or condition of the cassette 3. During 
recording of the program, or after the recording, the 
bar code reading writing section 2 records the cassette 
management information onto the label 5 which is stuck  
 
to the cassette 3, as the bar code 4, automatically or 
on the basis of
