region in which a source and a channel are formed. A drain drift region is 

further formed partly in the SOI region and partly in the bulk silicon region 
beyond SOI and a gate is coupled to said SOI channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of semiconductor 
integrated circuits, and more particularly the present invention relates to 
high voltage devices. There has been much recent progress in the field of power transistors, 
such as LDMOS (lateral double diffused MOS) power transistors with low 
"on-resistance" (RdsON), and RESURF (reduced surface field) devices. 
Please refer to Appels, J. A. and Vaes, H. M. J., "High Voltage Thin Layer 
Devices (RESURF Devices)," IEDM Tech. Digest, pp. 238-241, 1979, for a 
more detailed description of the RESURF technology. Power devices are typically used in two circuit configurations, as a low 
side driver or a high side driver. In a low side driver circuit configuration, 
the drain of the power device is coupled to the power supply through a load 
circuit, and its source is coupled to ground. In a high side driver circuit 
configuration, the drain is coupled directly to a power supply, and the source 
is coupled to ground through a load circuit. RESURF LDMOS transistors are 
commonly used in the low side driver configuration because the source is 
structurally coupled to the substrate which in turn is coupled to ground. 
Therefore, these power devices are not used in high side driver applications 
and other applications where electrical isolation between the source and 
substrate is desirable. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a high voltage device with 
electrical isolation between source and substrate to be used as a high side  
 
driver. Additionally, it is necessary that such high power device exhibit low 
on-resistance (RdsON) characteristics. In accordance with the present invention, a high voltage high-side 
driver RESURF LDMOS is provided which eliminates problems associated 
with prior RESURF LDMOS power transistors. In one aspect of the present invention, a high voltage transistor 
includes a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) region in which a source and a 
channel are formed. A bulk semiconductor drain drift region is further 
formed beyond the SOI region and a gate is coupled to said SOI channel. In another aspect of the present invention, a method for fabricating a 
high voltage transistor includes forming a localized SOI region in a 
semiconductor substrate, and forming a source region in the SOI region. A 
drain and a drain drift region is further formed in the substrate generally 
outside of the SOI region. A gate is then formed above the SOI channel and 
between the source region and the drain drift region. An important technical
