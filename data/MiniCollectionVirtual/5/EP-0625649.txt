<ABSTRACT>
A vibration proofing structure for a driver's seat 
of a car or the like capable of effectively absorbing 

vibration. A lower oil damper (20) mounted on a lower base 
10 includes a first tank (19), first pistons (25) arranged in 

the tank (19), and a first vertical rod (27) connected at a 

lower end thereof to the pistons (25) and at an upper end 
thereof through an intermediate plate (34) to a second tank (45) 

of an upper oil damper (44), in which second pistons (47) are 
arranged. The second pistons (47) are connected thereto a 

lower end of a second vertical rod (27), of which an upper end 
is connected to an upper base (54). A support (38) is arranged 

on each of both sides of the lower oil damper (20) and a 
horizontal rod (41) is connected to each of the supports (38) 

so as to extend through a rubber pad (43) to the intermediate 
plate (34). Thus, vibration applied to the lower base (10) is 

absorbed by the lower oil damper (20). A portion of the 
vibration which fails to be absorbed is prevented from being 

transmitted to the upper oil damper (44) by the horizontal 
rods (41), so that the vibration is prevented from being 

transmitted from the lower base (10) to the upper base (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vibration proofing
structrue,and more particularly to a vibration proofing
sturcture suitable for use for various applications including a
seat for a vehicle or the like, a construction, an internal
combustion engine,a rotary machine,a machine tool,a precision
instrument,a measuring instrument and the like.Conventionally,a vibration proofing structure which is
constructed so as to incorporate a spring therein has been
principally used for a driver's seat of each of a car and a
truck,a seat provided in a driver's cab of each of a train and a
construction machine and the like. Also,a vibration proofing
mechanism or structure having a vibration proof rubber, an oil
damper or the like incorporated therein has been used for a
construction such as a general construction,nuclear facilities,
a tank,plant facilities or the like. Further,a vibration
proofing structure in which a spring,a vibration proof rubber,
an oil damper or the like is incorporated has been used for an
internal combustion engine,a rotary machine,a machine tool,a
precision instrument, a measuring instrument or the like.Unfortunately, such conventional vibration proofing
structures as described above each fail to exhibit a satisfactory
vibration proofing function. In view of the above,the inventor
developed a vibration proofing mechanism or structure which is
capable of effectively absorbing vibration,as disclosed in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No.
140651/1991 (Japanese Patent No 2,676,559) showing the prior art according to the preamble of claim 1.
The vibration proofing structure disclosed is
constructed in such a manner that a base and an oil damper
including a cylinder in which a piston and a rod connected to
each other are connected to cacti other through a guide
mechanism for guiding the base and oil damper so as to
permit both to be linearly reciprocated relative to each other.
Also, the vibration proofing structure includes a mounting bar
which is mounted at one end thereof on the rod in a manner to 
extend perpendicularly to the rod and projected at the other end
thereof from the cylinder.The vibration proofing structure disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 140651/1991 which is
constructed as described above is substantially increased in
vibration proofing function as compared with the above-described
conventional structures and exhibits satisfactory applicability
to various technical fields. Nevertheless, the vibration
proofing structure disclosed is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vibration proofing structure comprising:

a first base (10);
a first oil damper (20) mounted on said first
base (10);
said first oil damper (20) including a first tank
(19) mounted on said first base (10), first pistons (25)

arranged in said first tank (19), and a first rod (27)
having a first end and a second end, said first end of

said first rod (27) being mounted on said first pistons
(25) so as to render an axis of said first rod (27)

perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of said first
pistons (25), said second end of said first rod (27)

outwardly extending from said first tank;

characterised by:

a second oil damper (44) including a second tank
(45), second pistons (47) arranged in said second tank

(45), and a second rod (49) having a first end and a
second end, said first end of said second rod (49) being

mounted on said second pistons (47) so as to render an
axis of said second rod (49) perpendicular to a

longitudinal axis of said second pistons (47), said
second end of said second rod (49) outwardly extending

from said second tank (45); and
a second base (54) on which the second end of
said second rod (49) is mounted;
said first and second oil dampers (20,44) being
juxtaposed to each other;
said second end of said first (27) rod being
connected to said second tank (45) of said second oil

damper (44), and said first rod (27) of said first oil
damper (20) being connected to said second tank (45) of

said second oil damper (44) so as to permit said first
and second oil dampers (20,44) to rotate relative to each

other.
A vibration proofing structure as defined in
Claim 1, wherein said first tank (19) of said first oil

damper (20) is mounted on said first base (10) so as to
permit said first oil damper (20) and first base (10) to

rotate relative to each other.
A vibration proofing structure as defined in
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said second end of said second rod

(49) is mounted on said second base (54) so as to permit
