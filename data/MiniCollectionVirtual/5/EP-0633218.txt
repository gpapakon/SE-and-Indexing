<ABSTRACT>
Cutting device (1) for cutting in peripheral direction through the 
jacket (25) of a cylindrical holder, comprising three blades (3) 

connected to a base element (2) and rotatable in the same cutting plane 
for cutting at three locations through the cylindrical jacket to be 

arranged rotatably relative to these blades, positioning means (8,9,10) 
for carrying the blades from a free position into an active position 

wherein the blades cut through the jacket, in addition to control means 
(11) for rotating the jacket and the blades relative to each other 

through an angle such that the jacket is cut through completely, wherein 
the base element is provided with blade guides (4) for displacing the 

blades therealong, and the positioning means comprise a system of 
mutually coupled connecting arms (8) connected to these blades.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cutting device for cutting in 
peripheral direction through the jacket of a cylindrical holder, 
comprising three blades connected to a base element and 
rotatable in the same cutting plane for cutting at three 
locations through the cylindrical jacket to be arranged 
rotatably relative to these blades, positioning means for 
carrying the blades from a free position into an active position 
wherein the blades cut through the jacket, in addition to 
control means for rotating the jacket and the blades relative to 
each other through an angle such that the jacket is cut through 
completely. Such a cutting device is known in the form of a can 
opener from the American patent no. 2 515 362. The known can opener consists of a substantially 
triangular base plate to which two rotatable blades are fixedly 
attached and a third blade is connected to a gear rack for 
movement in a direction transversely of the connecting line 
between the two first blades. The rack in the known can opener 
co-acts with a toothed wheel, the shaft of which protrudes 
through the base plate and is connected to a transverse arm. In 
order to open a can with the known cutting device the movable 
cutting wheel is placed using the transverse arm at a distance 
from the two other cutting wheels such that a can for opening 
can be placed between the three cutting wheels. In practice the 
can for opening is placed upright and the cutting device is 
placed thereon such that the cutting wheels are situated below 
and the shaft with the transverse arm above the base plate. By 
rotating the shaft the movable cutting wheel is pulled onto the 
jacket of the can for opening, with further rotation the movable 
cutting wheel is pressed into the jacket of the can and the two 
fixed cutting wheels are also pressed into the can. The  
 
displacement of the movable cutting wheel caused by the movement 
of the rack is in radial direction relative to the axis of the 
can for opening. When this displacement in radial direction 
undergoes sufficient resistance the cutting device will, when 
the transverse arm is further displaced, begin to turn relative 
to the can for opening, wherein the cutting wheels cut through 
the can in peripheral direction. A number of drawbacks are associated with the known 
cutting device. Due to the fixed position of two cutting wheels 
the known can opener is only suitable for opening cans of one 
particular diameter. When a can is clamped by the three wheels 
of the can opener the mutual distances
