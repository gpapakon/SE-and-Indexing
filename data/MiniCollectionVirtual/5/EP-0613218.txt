<ABSTRACT>
A mother board to-daughter-board electrical connector 
(2) comprises a metal housing (8) having mounting feet 

(58) for securing it to a mother circuit board (MB), and 
a rocker assembly (10) consisting of an elastomeric 

electrical connector element (4) and a metal spring 
support (6) fixed together in internested relationship. 

The connector element (4) has an upright arm (14) and a 
transverse arm (16), a first node (22) projecting from the 

upright arm (14) and a second node (26) projecting from 
the transverse arm (16). Printed conductors (28) on the 

connector element (4) have contact surfaces (30,32) 
extending over the nodes (22,26). The metal support (6) 

has trunnions (44) which engage in circular openings (60) 
in side plates (50) of the housing (8). The daughter 

circuit board (DB) can be inserted into the housing (8) in 
a vertical, pre-loaded position and can be tilted towards 

the rocker assembly (10) so as to be latched thereagainst 
by latching tongues (56) on the housing (8), in a 

connecting position, in which conductors (PC2) on the 
daughter board (DB) engage respective ones of the contact 

surfaces (30) on the first node (22). The contact 
surfaces (32) on the second node (26) engage the 

conductors (PC1) on the mother board (MB). As the 
daughter board (DB) is tilted to its connecting position, 

the rocker assembly (10) is tilted in the same direction 
against the resilient action of the spring support (6) 

whereby contact surfaces (30) on the first node (22) are 
spring loaded against the conductors (PC2) of the daughter 

board (DB).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elastomeric electrical
connector for connecting conductors on a daughter
circuit board to respective conductors on a mother circuit
board.There is disclosed in US-A-4,693,529, an electrical
connector for interconnecting first conductors on a
mother circuit board to respective second conductors on a
daughter circuit board, the connector comprising; an
elastomeric connector element having first and second
substantially orthogonally projecting nodes and
conductors each having a first contact circuit on the
first node and a second contact surface on the second
node; and a housing receiving the connector element, the
housing having means for securing it to the mother board
with the second contact surfaces engaging respective ones
of the first conductors, and means for latching the
daughter board to the housing in a latched position with
the first contact surfaces engaging respective ones of the
second conductors.A disadvantage of using an elastomeric element for
supporting the third conductors is that, in time, the
elastomeric material of the connector element tends to set
thereby impairing the electrical connection between the
conductors of the mother and daughter circuit boards.According, therefore, to the present invention, an
electrical connector as defined in the second paragraph of
this specification is characterized in that the
elastomeric connector element is mounted in the housing on
a spring support so as to be rockable against the action
thereof by the act of latching the daughter board to the
housing, whereby in the latched position of the daughter
board the first contact surfaces are spring loaded by said
spring support against the second conductors. Thus, the first contact surfaces will follow the set
of the elastomeric material of the connector element,
should such set occur over the passage of time.The spring support is preferably L-shaped, the
elastomeric connector element also being L-shaped and
being internested in the spring support.The conductors of the elastomeric connector element are preferably printed on to the
elastomeric material thereof.According to the embodiment described herein, the
elastomeric connector element is fixed, for example by
means of an adhesive, to the spring support, the spring
support being rockable about pivot means comprising part
circular trunnions projecting from opposite ends of the
support and being rotatably received in respective holes
in opposite side walls of the housing. The end edges of
each trunnion define a slot into
