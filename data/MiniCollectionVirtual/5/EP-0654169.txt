<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming crystalline metal oxide thin films on silicon and the resultant structure. A crystalline buffer layer (10) of yttria-stabilized zirconia is deposited on a silicon substate (12). A thin template layer (14) of an anisotropic perovskite such as bismuth titanate or yttria barium copper oxide is deposited on the buffer layer under conditions favoring (c)-axis oriented growth. A nominally cubic metal-oxide layer (16) is deposited on the template layer which facilitates its singly crystalline growth. The metal oxide, often a nominally cubic perovskite, may be a conductive electrode, a ferroelectric, a non-hysteretic dielectric, a piezoelectric, or other class of material.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, the invention relates to crystalline thin films and their
growth. In particular, it relates to the growth of cubic perovskite or metal oxide thin
films on a silicon substrate with intermediate buffer layers.Epitaxial thin films, once the nearly exclusive preserve of
semiconductor technology, have been recently used to advantage in several other
technologies.High-temperature superconductors, such as YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO),
exhibit the best and most reproducible superconductive behavior when they are
epitaxially grown as singly crystalline thin films on a crystalline substrate. Most of
these high-temperature ceramic superconductors have an anisotropic perovskite
crystalline structure. For instance, YBCO has a- and b-axis lattice parameters of
0.382 and 0.388 nm but a c-axis lattice parameter of 1.168 nm. Inam et al. have
disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 07/531,255, filed May 31, 1991, a
superconducting Josephson device in which two YBCO electrodes sandwich an
insulating or at most semiconducting or normally conducting layer of
PrBa2Cu3O7-x. All three layers are epitaxially grown with a c-axis orientation;
that is, the c-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the film.I and my co-inventors have extended this approach to ferroelectric
materials for use in memories. In U.S. Patents 5,155,658 and 5,168,420, both
incorporated herein by reference and commonly assigned with the present invention,
I and my co-inventors describe a device in which two YBCO electrodes sandwich a
ferroelectric layer of, for example, PbZrxTi1-xO3, where 0<x<1 (PZT). which is
only slightly distorted from a cubic lattice structure. All the three layers are
epitaxially grown so as to be singly crystalline thin films. In one embodiment, the 
YBCO is c-axis oriented, that is, the c-axis is perpendicular to the film surface and
the bottom YBCO layer is grown directly on a LaAlO3 substrate. It is not anticipated
that such ferroelectric memories would operate at superconducting temperatures;
instead, they rely on the normal conductivity of the YBCO electrodes.Both superconductive devices and ferroelectric devices would enjoy
greater commercial success if they could be integrated on a silicon substrate with
silicon electronic circuitry. As a result, the technology has developed for epitaxially
growing YBCO on Si. Fork et al. have disclosed such a technique in "High critical
currents in strained epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7-δ on Si," Applied Physics Letters, volume
57, 1990, pp. 1161-1163. They first deposit a layer of yttria-stabilized
