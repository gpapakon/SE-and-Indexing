<ABSTRACT>
Packaging machine for manufacturing filled and sealed packaging 
containers (32), said machine including an endless conveyor (2) along 

which are disposed replaceable machine modules (16,17,18). Each of the 
modules is driven by an individual motor (24,28). The different motors 

are controlled by a common control unit. Along the conveyor are disposed 
a first station (16) where the containers are transferred and 

bottom-sealed and a second station (17,18) for top-sealing of the 
containers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging machine for manufacturing
filled and sealed packaging containers, comprising an endless, horizontal conveyor
and two or more workstations disposed therealong, said workstations are in the form
of replaceable machine modules, each of which is drivable by means of an
associated motor, whereby the motors of the different modules are controlled by a
common control unit.Trends within the field of packaging machines point towards
increasingly high capacity machines intended for rapid, continuous
production of a very large number of identical or similar packaging
containers, e.g. such as are intended for liquid contents such as milk, juice
and the like. However, even though the various functions of such packaging
machines are greatly integrated with a view to restricting the size of the
machines, the space requirements continue to grow. The state-of-the-art
generation of high capacity filling machines for, for example, milk, are of
such size that, for reasons of space, they are often incapable of replacing
an older machine of lower capacity but instead require as good as the same
space as two such prior art models. In addition, from the point of view of
capacity, two slower machines may occasionally be comparable with a
single modern high capacity machine and, moreover, afford a higher
degree of flexibility when it comes to the simultaneous manufacture of
packaging containers of different sizes or types, or packaging containers
which are to be filled with different types of liquid contents.Many of the prior art packaging machines which are currently in
operation on the market manufacture single-use disposable packages of
laminated, plastic-coated fibre material which, in the form of flat-laid blanks,
is fed to a magazine in the packaging machine. Each packaging container
blank is transferred from the magazine to a mandrel which serves as backup
counterface when the one end of the packaging container blank is
folded down and heat-sealed for forming a liquid-tight bottom in the
packaging container. The blank is then placed in a conveyor which is
advanced stepwise so that the blank passes stations for top-forming, filling
and top-sealing, whereafter (possibly after final forming) it is discharged
from the packaging machine in the form of a filled and sealed packaging
container. The stepwise advancement in the transport sequence is 
restricted - in both frequency and speed - by the fact that the packaging
containers which are located between the filling station and the

<CLAIMS>
A packaging machine for manufacturing filled and sealed packaging containers,
comprising an endless, horizontal conveyor and two or more workstations disposed

therealong, said workstations (16, 17, 18) are in the form of replaceable machine
modules, each of which is drivable by means of an associated motor (24, 28),

whereby the motors of the different modules are controlled by a common control

unit, 
characterized in that
 said endless conveyor (2) constitutes a main conveyor
immediately below which an infeed conveyor (8) extends partly in parallel, whereby a

combined transfer-and bottom sealing station (16) is located at the mutually parallel
sections of the conveyors (2, 8) in order, in connection with the transfer of the

packaging container blanks between said conveyors, to cater for an end sealing of
the packaging container blanks before reaching a second station (17, 18) for filling

and top-sealing of packaging container blanks.
The machine as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the conveyor (2) has a
first part along which said transfer and bottom-sealing station is placed and disposed

simultaneously to process a group of packaging container blanks, said filling and top-sealing
station (17) disposed along the same conveyor part being operative to fill and

seal a portion of the packaging containers included in said group, the machine
including, along a second, return part of the conveyor (2), a second filling and top-sealing

station (18) for filling and sealing the remaining packaging container blanks
included in said group.
The machine as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 each one of the two
filling and top-sealing stations (17, 18) has a capacity which is half of the capacity of

the other stations.
The machine as claimed in any one or more of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that

the transfer section of said first station (16) includes reciprocal lifting devices (19),
which are disposed, during simultaneous configurational action on the one end of the

packaging container blank, to displace said blank from the infeed conveyor (8) to the
main conveyor (2). 
The machine as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 both the main conveyor
(2) and the infeed conveyor (8) are divided into compartments.
The machine as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the bottom-sealing
portion of said first station (16) is located between the parallel sections of the

conveyors (8, 2).
The machine as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the bottom-sealing
portion of said first station (16) is located immediately beneath the main conveyor (2)

and is disposed to seal the end portions of the packaging container blanks extending
outside the compartments of the main conveyor (2).
The machine as claimed in any one or more of claims 6 or 7, 
characterized in
that
 the second station (17, 18) is located above the conveyor (2) and is disposed to
seal the opposite end of the packaging container blanks after filling of the packaging

containers with their contents.
The machine as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the sealing and filling
portions of the second station (17, 18) are located at the same place along the

conveyor (2).
The machine as claimed in any one or more of claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in
that
 the filling portion of the second station (17, 18) includes filler pipes (29) which
are located above the devices of the sealing portion for sealing the packaging

containers.
