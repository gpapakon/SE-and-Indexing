<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method for increasing the ultraviolet light stability 
of articles made from macromolecular materials comprising: forming a flame-retarded 

formulation containing macromolecular material and a mixture of (i) a first 
alkylenebis(tetrabromophthalimide) flame retardant having a yellowness index (YI) value 

ranging from 20 to 40 as determined by ASTM D-1925; and (ii) a second alkylenebis(tetrabromophthalimide) 
flame retardant having a yellowness index (YI) value (ASTM D-1925) 

ranging from 2 to 15 whereby the uv stability of a test plaque made from the flame-retarded 
formulation is greater than the arithmetic average of the uv stabilities of a test 

plaque made from a flame-retarded formulation containing (i) but not (ii) and of a test 
plaque made from a flame-retarded formulation containing (ii) but not (i).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unique blend of flame retardant components which provide a synergistic increase in ultraviolet (uv) stability of articles made from polymeric formulations containing the flame retardant components.Typically, the uv stability of polymeric materials is provided by uv stabilizers which are colorless or nearly colorless organic substances. Ultraviolet radiation contains a quantum of energy sufficient to exceed the dissociation energy of covalent bonds found in polymeric materials. Without the use of uv stabilizers, visible light containing uv radiation tends to cause polymeric materials to discolor and become brittle; protective coatings to crack, chalk, and delaminate; and dyes and pigments to fade. Accordingly, additives which increase the light stability of flame-retarded formulations are generally required. For the purposes of this invention, the term "uv stability" shall also refer to the light stability of the formulation, blend, or articles made from such formulations or blends.Classes of compounds used to reduce light-induced degradation of polymeric materials, include uv absorbers, hindered amines, nickel chelates, hindered phenols, and aryl esters. Commercially available uv absorbers include derivatives of 2-hydroxybenzophenones, 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazoles, diphenylacrylates and oxalanilides. Hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) include bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl) sebacate, CHIMASSORB速 944, and TINUVIN速 622. Depending on their structures, nickel chelates, such as CYASORB速 UV 1084, IRGASTAB速 2002, and nickel dialkyldithiocarbamates, contribute to light stabilization of polymeric substances by decomposing hydroperoxides, scavenging free radicals, absorbing uv radiation, and quenching photoexcited chromophores. Suitable aryl esters include resorcinol monobenzoate, phenyl salicylate, substituted aryl salicylates, diaryl terephthalates, and isophthalates.While the use of uv stabilizer additives provides a significant increase in the uv stability of polymeric materials containing them, there continues to be a need to increase the uv stability of macromolecular formulations without increasing the amount of uv stabilizer additive required.EP-A-0 327 324 discloses a process for enhancing the properties of alkylene (C1-C6)-bis-(tetrabromophthalimide) or bis-(tetrabromophthalimide) products. These products are used in molding and extrusion compositions.It has been discovered, inter alia, that the uv stability of articles made from macromolecular formulations
