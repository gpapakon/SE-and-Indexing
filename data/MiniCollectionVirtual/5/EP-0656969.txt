<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a method of making a wet formed, sheeted, readily reslurriable sheeted crosslinked cellulose and the products made by the method. Crosslinked wood pulp fibers tend to be quite brittle. If crosslinked while in sheeted form, the sheets cannot be readily defibred, either in a wet or dry state, without serious fiber degradation. The sheet products of the present invention can be easily redispersed or repulped in water without significant fiber breakage. The present products are made by including within the sheet, while still in wet form, a debonding or softening agent which is preferably added before the latent crosslinking reactant. Most preferably the debonder is added prior to the headbox of a paper machine and the crosslinking reactant is applied near theend of the forming wire or at the press section. The treated sheet is dried conventionally. Crosslinking may occur entirely during drying or during a period of additional heating, usually at a temperature in excess of 100  DEG C for a short period of time. Conventional debonding agents and crosslinking reactants are suitable. The softening agent apparently reduces or prevents adhesive bonding between adjacent fibers caused by polymer formation external to the fibers under reaction conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of making a sheeted
crosslinked cellulose and the product resulting from the process. The invention is
especially directed toward a crosslinked cellulose sheet which can later be easily
reslurried in water without excessive fiber breakage.Crosslinked cellulose products have been described in the chemical
literature for many years. These products are normally made by reacting a material,
usually bifunctional, that will tie together hydroxyl groups on neighboring cellulose
chains. Formaldehyde and various derivatives of urea have been the crosslinking
agents which have received the greatest study. However, many other materials
which have actual or latent bifunctional reactive groups have also been reported.Crosslinked celluloses are of great commercial importance in the textile
industry where they are widely used for the production of wash-and-wear and other
wrinkle-resistant types of fabrics. Crosslinked cellulose fluff has also been described
for use in disposable absorbent products such as diapers. Here advantage is taken
of the fact that crosslinked fibers are normally stiffer than their untreated
counterparts. The fluff products formed from these fibers are of somewhat lower
density (or greater bulk) and tend to hold retained liquid better under compressive
forces encountered during use of the product.While the advantages contributed to disposable absorbent products by
crosslinked cellulose fibers are real, products using these crosslinked fibers have
never become commercially important. This is apparently because of the difficulty 
of making a sheeted crosslinked fiber product that can be later refiberized at the
point of use without creation of an excessive amount of fines. Unfortunately,
crosslinking also results in considerable fiber embrittlement. Additionally, most of
the crosslinking agents which have been used serve to give both chemical and
physical bonding between adjacent fibers in the sheets. This, in addition to the
increased fiber brittleness, has made mechanical wet or dry defiberization of sheeted
crosslinked pulps impractical. In an effort to overcome this problem, various
workers have considered treating sheeted pulp with a latent crosslinking material,
fluffing, and then carrying out the crosslinking reaction by heating the cellulose fluff.
An example of this is seen in Bernardin, US-A-3,224,926. Van Haaften,
C-A-A-806,352 treats loose fibers with a crosslinking material and catalyst.
These moist fibers are then expanded into a loose
