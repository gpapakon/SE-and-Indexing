<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to new fusion proteins which consist of a 
tumor-associated targeting element preferentially a monoclonal antibody 

or a fragment thereof recognizing a molecule which is preferentially 
expressed on human tumor cells such as the human epidermal growth 

factor receptor (EGFR), and a biologically active ligand such as a growth 
and/or differentiation factor. The resulting fusion protein may be used to 

deliver the biologically active ligand to a specific target cell or tissue. The 
new immunoconjugates can be used in tumor therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new fusion proteins which consist of a
tumor-associated targeting element preferentially a monoclonal antibody
or a fragment thereof recognizing a molecule which is preferentially
expressed on human timer cells such as the human epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), and TNFα.
The resulting fusion protein may be used to
deliver the biologically active ligand to a specific target cell or tissue. The
new immunoconjugates can be used in tumor therapy.A variety of different therapeutic concepts have been used for the treatment
of cancer patients. In the past years clinical trials have been performed
with monoclonal antibodies, which recognize specifically or preferentially
cell surface molecules expressed on malignant cells. Aim of this
approach is the induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC) or complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) to eliminate tumor
cells. A second approach is the cytokine-mediated activation of an
immune response.The cytokine-induced anti-tumor activity can be mediated
by:
1) a direct cytotoxic/cytostatic effect of the cytokine on tumor growth2) tumor-antigen-nonspecific mechanisms such as LAK activity or monocyte/macrophage
mediated cytotoxicity3) tumor-antigen specific immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8-positive
T cells. In this situation a systemic immunity against the tumor
has been observed in animal models.Unfortunately, systemic application of cytokines such as IL-2 or TNFα is
hampered by their toxicity (Rubin, Cancer Invest. 11:460-472, 1990;
Balkwill, Nature 361:206-207, 1993). To ensure a sufficient cytokine concentration 
at the tumor site rather high doses have to be administered and
the maximumly tolerable dose is below the dose required for efficacy.
Therefore, the negative effects of cytokines are mainly a consequence of
the systemic application, but their clinical relevance in tumor therapy is
undoubted. In animal models it was demonstrated that in situ presence of
the cytokine either by intratumoral injection or by secretion of transfected
tumor cells may lead to tumor regression (Hock et al. PNAS 90:2774-2778,
1993; Colombo et al. Cancer Res. 52:4853-4857, 1992; McBride et
al., Cancer Res. 52:3931-3937, 1992; Tepper et al., Science 257:548-551,
1992; Mullen et al., Cancer Res. 52:6020-6024, 1992; Blankenstein
et al., J. Exp. Med 173:1047-1052, 1991; Gansbacher et al., J. Exp. Med.
172:1217-1224, 1990). In these systems, cytokines do not impair tumor
proliferation, but are capable of activating a rapid and

<CLAIMS>
A fusion protein comprising a monoclonal antibody or a fragment thereof directed to
a tumor cell bearing an antigen epitope of the epidermal growth factor receptor

(EGF-R) and a biologically active cytokine which is fused to said antibody or
antibody fragment and having a cytotoxic capacity to lyse the tumor cell specifically,

wherein the cytokine is TNFα and wherein said antibody consists essentially of the
variable region of the antibody heavy chain, the CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains of the

constant region, and the appropriate light chain (antibody-CH3 fusionprotein) or
wherein said antibody fragment consists essentially of the variable region of the

antibody heavy chain, the CH1 and CH2 domains of the constant region, and the
appropriate light chain (antibody-CH2 fusionprotein).
A fusion protein according to claim 1 wherein said monoclonal antibody is murine,
chimeric or humanized MAb 425.
A fusion protein according to claim 1 or 2 selected from the group MAb 425-CH2-TNFα
