<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the purification of pentafluoroethane (F125) containing chloropentafluoroethane (F115). The F125-F115 mixture to be purified is subjected to a fluorination stage in order to convert the F115 to hexafluoroethane (F116), which is then separated from the F125, for example by distillation.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the purification of a crude pentafluoroethane 
containing chloropentafluoroethane, 

characterized in that it consists in subjecting the crude 
pentafluoroethane to a catalytic fluorination to convert 

chloropentafluoroethane to hexafluoroethane, and then in 
isolating the hexafluoroethane formed. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the 
hexafluoroethane for
med is isolated by distillation. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
fluorination is performed in the gas phase by means of 

hydrofluoric acid. 
Process according to Claim 3, in which the 
fluorination is carried out at a temperature of between 

300 and 600°C, preferably between 350 and 550°C, and more 
particularly between 380 and 480°C. 
Process according to Claim 3 or 4, in which the 
contact time is between 3 and 300 seconds, preferably 

between 15 and 200 seconds. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 5, in 
which the molar ratio HF/pentafluoroethane + chloropentafluoroethane 

is between 0.05 and 20, preferably between 
0.5 and 10, and more particularly between 0.6 and 5. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 6, in 
which the fluorination is performed at a pressure ranging 

from 0 to 25 bars gauge, preferably at atmospheric 
pressure. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 7, in 
which the fluorination is performed in the presence of 

oxygen. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 8, in  
 

which a mixed catalyst is employed which is based on 
nickel and chromium oxides, halides and/or oxyhalides 

which are deposited on a support consisting of aluminium 
fluoride or of a mixture of aluminium fluoride and 

alumina. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 8, in 
which a bulk Cr₂O₃ or Ni-Cr catalyst is employed.
