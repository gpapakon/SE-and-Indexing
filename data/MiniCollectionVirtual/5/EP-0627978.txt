<ABSTRACT>
Manufacturing process of panels or finished products, particularly for thermic, sound and similar insulation, by using raw materials like the paper, the Bristol board, the cardboard and similar materials, which are in succession or at deferred times cut to obtain particles with reduced dimensions, mixed to fire-retardant, adhesives, and bonding agents, and additives of various types and compressed at heated or cooled conditions and finally dried and packed. There are described different possibilities of performing the process and different embodiments as well as use modes of the so obtained panels or finished products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a manufacturing process for 
products of insulating 
material, in particular thermic insulating material, to 
be installed in habitable buildings, and also concerns 
a product in particular a thermic and sound insulating panel, 
obtained by such manufacturing process.  
 From JP-A-59 026 208 is known a manufacturing process of heat 
insulating moulding, using a mixture obtained by adding a 
finely ground styrene resinous foam as essential raw material 
and a thickener, a flame-retarding agent or a water-repellent 
agent or their mixture to a waste paper, wetted under 
immersion in water and shredded in particles and fibers of 
reduced dimensions, and by press moulding into required form 
such mixture of ground styrene resin foam, waste wetted paper 
and thickener, flame-retarding agent or water-repellent 
agent, and by drying it. In contrast to the process according to JP-A-59 026 208, 
the present invention relates to a manufacturing process which 
dispenses with the use of styrene resinous foam.  
 This process is defined in the appended claim 1. The present invention will result more comprehensive 
from the following description, given solely by way of 
a not limitative example, and with reference to the 
single enclosed drawing showing schematically a system 
for the industrial production of panels or similar 
finished products in accordance with the process of the 
present invention. The present process is substantially provided for the 
manufacturing of finished products of various 
type, form and dimensions in particular panels to be installed in 
civil and 
industrial and promiscuous habitable buildings, for 
insulation purposes, specially for the thermic 
insulation of the internal and external ambients of 
such buildings and for partition and equipped walls. This process substantially provides the use of 
insulating materials like paper, cardboard, and similar 
material which are generally rejected after the use and 
which otherwise would be abandoned or in case recovered 
for their recycling in other application fields, as for 
example the manufacturing of recycled paper, cardboard, 
with per se known methods and uses. These papers, cardboard and the like materials may be 
of any type, forms, dimensions, specific weights, 
compositions and quantities and are collected from the 
collecting and storage places thereof, in order to be 
treated in the ways and for the purposes hereinafter 
described. In particular, in the case in which as raw 
material for the following
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Manufacturing process of various types of products for the 
most different uses, particularly thermic and sound 

insulating panels for internal and external habitable 
ambients of buildings as well as partition and equipped 

walls, by employing raw materials consisting of paper, Bristol board, 
cardboard and similar materials, which have been rejected after 

their use, as well as cellulose and wastes of natural or synthetic 
fabrics from the clothing industry, which raw materials may be used 

separately or in combination with one another, and  
 

are preferably 
submitted to preventive drying, and by submitting in 

succession or at different periods said raw materials to a 
first step in which they are cut on particles of reduced 

dimensions with the form of strips and fibers by 
trituration, crushing, grinding and similar processes, a second 

step in which said particles of raw materials are mixed, 
preferably within mixing-containing devices, with adhesives 

and bonding agents, fire-retardant and water repellent 
substances, 

as well as at least one additive material suitable to confer 
special features to the mixture, 

and a third step in which said mixed particles 
are submitted to compression operations like moulding, 

pressing and the like, to obtain the product which 
subsequently is dried. 
Manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said additive materials comprise liquid
 and 
condensate absorbing substances, anti-mildews substances, 

anti-corrosive and anti-odour substances, as well as 
bactericide, disinfectant, sterilizing and fertilizing 

substances, at different and variable ratios. 
Manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said fire-retardant substances are constituted by 

carbonates, silicates, urea, micronized silica, borax, boron 
derivatives, antimony dioxide and antimony trioxide, kaolin,  

 
aluminium hydrate, talk and bentonite, which also absorb the 

humidity. 
Manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said mixture of adhesives, bonding agents, raw 

materials and additive materials is moulded or pressed at 
cooled conditions, so as to obtain the crystallization 

thereof. 
Product, particularly thermic and sound insulating panel 
for internal and external habitable ambients of buildings as 

well as for partition and equipped walls, characterized in 
that it is formed with the manufacturing process according to 

claims 1-4.
