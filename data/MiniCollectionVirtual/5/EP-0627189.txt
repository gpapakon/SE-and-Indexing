<ABSTRACT>
A dust bag (1) is equipped on its front side (1a) with a double-layer holding plate (2) for fastening in a vacuum cleaner. An inlet opening (3) of the holding plate (2) can be closed by means of a closure strip (4) made along its entire length of flexible material. To avoid a lateral drawing-together of the closure strip (4) upon closure of the inlet opening (3), said closure strip is of relatively rigid construction at least immediately above its through-opening (4a).

<CLAIMS>
A filter bag (1), in particular for vacuum cleaners, with a holding plate (2) 
designed with twin layers (2a, 2b), which is provided with an intake opening (3), 

as well as with a closing strip (4) mounted for displacement and consisting over 
its whole length of a material elastic in flexure, which is also provided with a 

through opening (4a) that is in the working position coincident with the intake 
opening (3), and which is with one end (4c) secured on the holding plate (2), so 

that a part zone (4b) of its reach projects in the form of a loop out of the holding 
plate (2), and its other end (4e) projects as a gripping part (4d) out of the holding 

plate (2), 
characterized in that
 the closing strip (4) is stiffened at least directly 
above the through opening (4a). 
A filter bag according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the stiffened 
section of the closing strip (4) is in the working position disposed at least partly 

between the layers (2a, 2b) of the holding plate (2). 
A filter bag according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the closing 
strip (4) is stiffened at least directly above the through opening (4a) by a 

reinforcing strip (6) extending at least approximately over its whole width. 
A filter bag according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcing 
strip (6) extends over the whole zone of the closing strip (4) having the through 

opening (4a). 
A filter bag according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcing 
strip (6) is connected solely to the closing strip (4). 
A filter bag according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in 
that
 the strip (4) has a coating on its surface which increases its ability to slide.  
 
A filter bag according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in 
that
 the closing strip (4) has an improved ability to slide, due to inserts (2c) 
provided between the two layers (2a, 2b) of the holding plate (2) which are 

provided in the zone of the two longitudinal edges (2e). 
A filter bag according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in 
that
 the lateral guidance for the closing strip (4) between the two layers (2a, 2b) 
of the holding plate (2) is formed by rivets (7) provided in the zone of the longitudinal 

edges (2e), which hold the two layers (2a, 2b) together. 
A filter bag according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in 
that
 the handle (4d) projects as a flexurally elastic section from the holding plate 
(2).
