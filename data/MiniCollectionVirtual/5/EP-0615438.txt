<ABSTRACT>
A composition for the sustained release of a biologically active therapeutic agent wherein the matrix of the sustained release composition is composed of an amorphous carbohydrate glass matrix comprising a suitable carbohydrate and an agent which retards the recrystallization of the carbohydrate and a biologically active therapeutic agent and a water-insoluble wax dispersed throughout the matrix. Biologically active therapeutic agents which can be incorporated into the carbohydrate glass matrix include prolactin, growth hormones, serum albumins, growth factors or any biologically active fragment or recombinant form thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a novel 
composition of matter for the sustained release of a 
therapeutic agent. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to a composition for the sustained 
release of a biologically active therapeutic agent from 
a biodegradable, amorphous carbohydrate glass matrix. 
Upon administration to a mammal, the amorphous 
carbohydrate glass matrix slowly dissolves, releasing 
the biologically active therapeutic agent into the 
physiological fluids of the animal. The preparation and employment of amorphous 
carbohydrate glasses are known in the "candy industry" 
as well as in the production of medicated lozenges. 
However, amorphous carbohydrate glasses have not been 
employed as matrix material for sustained release 
polypeptide compositions. Various sustained release 
methods and compositions are known for administering 
therapeutic agents to both humans and animals alike. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,671,953, issued to Stanley et al. in 
1987, describes a method and composition for 
administering sedatives, analgesics and anesthetics to 
a patient by incorporating the therapeutic agent into a 
lollipop. The lollipop is composed of a carbohydrate 
matrix or "candy matrix" with the therapeutic agent 
dispersed throughout the matrix. As the patient licks  
 
or sucks on the "candy matrix" the matrix breaks down, 
releasing the drug into the oral cavity where the drug 
is absorbed across the mucosal cavity. A serious 
limitation to this method of administering a 
therapeutic agent to a patient is that the therapeutic 
agent must be sufficiently lipophilic that it will 
readily pass across a mucosal membrane. Examples of 
therapeutic agents which can be administered by this 
method include morphine, fentanyl, valium, midazolam 
and the like. Polypeptides are not sufficiently 
lipophilic such that they could be administered to a 
patient by this means. U.S. Patent No. 4,765,980, issued to DePrince et 
al. in 1988, describes a method for stabilizing 
porcine growth hormone with porcine serum albumin in 
sustained release implant devices for swine. The 
porcine growth hormone and stabilizing amount of 
porcine serum albumin are compressed into a tablet or 
pellet with binders such as sodium bentonite, ethyl 
cellulose, stearic acid, adipic acid, fumaric acid, 
polyethylene glycol, deacetylated chitin and cellulose 
acetate. The pellets or tablets are loaded in a 
reservoir which can be implanted subcutaneously in 
swine where the growth hormone is slowly released from 
the
