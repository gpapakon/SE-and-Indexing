<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of automatically cutting indexes and an automatic index cutting machine (10) for carrying out the method. The inventive index cutting machine (10) is constructed of (n) number of modules (12:1-12:n), where each module includes a counting arrangement which functions to count a predetermined number of pages automatically for a specific index indentation, and a knife arrangement for cutting this predetermined number of pages. The book is transported between the modules (12:1-12:n) hanging from a transporting arrangement which includes a transporter (20) which holds the book hanging from its spine. Each module (12:1-12:n) counts up to an index indentation and the index indentation is then cut in the knife arrangement, whereafter the book is transported to the next module in which a count is made to the next index indentation and the index indentation is cut, this procedure being repeated module after module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of automatically 
cutting book indexing indentations and an automatic 
index cutting machine for carrying out the 
method. Present-day machines which cut indexing indentations 
or index tabs in pages that are larger than A5 are 
semiautomatic. A greater part of the work with these 
index cutting machines is effected manually. The 
number of pages that shall lie beneath a given index 
indentation or index tab are turned over by hand and 
then inserted manually beneath the reference. The work 
that is carried out automatically in such semiautomatic 
index cutting machines is the work of cutting an 
index indentation and re-adjustment to the next following 
index indentation. These procedures are carried 
on a book that lies flat on a supportive surface. An example of such 
a machine is described in US-A-2 763 324. The 
drawbacks with such semi-automatic index cutting 
machines is that they require a work force to carry 
out the manual procedures and that production is 
relatively low. These drawbacks are eliminated by the 
inventive automatic index cutting machine and automatic 
index cutting method having the characteristic 
features set forth in the characterizing clause of 
Claim 1 and Claim 7 respectively. The inventive index 
cutting machine is constructed of modules, where each 
module includes a counter which automatically counts a 
predetermined number of pages for a specific index 
indentation, and knife means for cutting said predetermined 
number of pages. The book is transported 
between the modules while hanging from a transportation 
device. In each module, a count is made up 
to the page on which an index or reference indentation 
is to be made and the page is then cut in the knife 
arrangement, whereafter the book is transported to the 
next module where a count is made to the intended  
 
place of the next index indentation and this page is 
cut, this procedure being repeated in module after 
module. The present invention will now be described in more 
detail with reference to an exemplifying embodiment 
thereof and also with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which 
Figure 1 is a schematic elevation of one embodiment of 
the inventive automatic index cutting machine; Figure 2 is a sectional view of part of the inventive 
automatic index cutting machine shown in Figure 1; and Figure 3 is a perspective view of a counter included 
in the inventive automatic index cutting machine. The exemplifying embodiment of the inventive automatic 
index

<CLAIMS>
An automatic book index cutting machine (10), including 
a plurality (n) of 

modules (12:12:n) each including a counter arrangement (32) which functions to count a 
predetermined number of pages for an index indentation specific for the modul, and a 

knife arrangement (28) for cutting said predetermined number of pages for one specific 
index indentation for the modul ; and in that the index cutting machine (10) also includes 

a plurality of transporters (20) which are made to hold and transport the books (26) by 
their respective spines. 
An automatic index cutting machine (10) according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the machine also includes a book storage device (14), a 
book input device (16) feeding a book from the storage device (14) to one of said transporters 

(20), and a book output device (18) feeding indexed books (26) out of the 
machine. 
An automatic index cutting machine (10) according to Claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the machine also includes control means for controlling the 
counters (32), such that each counter (32) will count a predetermined number of pages for 

a specific index indentation by the means of a programming unit connected to said control 
means. 
An automatic index cutting machine (10) according to Claim 3, 

characterized
 in that each counter (32) includes an oscillatable tongue-like 
element (34) provided with a hole (36) and oscillated by a motor by means of said control 

means, and a pin (38) which is rotated by means of said control means and said motor, 
wherein a page of the book (26) is sucked firmly against the tongue-like element (34) by 

vacuum acting through the hole (36) in said element, and wherein the two movements 
coact mutually in a manner to separate the counted pages from uncounted pages by means 

of the tongue-like element (34). 
An automatic index counter (10) according to Claim 4, 

characterized
 in that each knife arrangement (28) includes a spring-biassed anvil 
means which holds firmly the pages to be cut, and a linearly movable knife means (30) 

which is driven by a pneumatic piston-cylinder device included in said knife arrangement 
(28), via a link system. 
A method for automatically index cutting books with the aid of an index 
cutting machine (10) involving the steps of  

 

a) feeding a book (27) by means of an infeed device (16) to a transporter (20) 
included in the index cutting machine (10) and holding the book (26) firmly by its spine; 
b) folding a cover side by suction beneath a tongue-like element (34) included in a 
counting arrangement (32) of the index cutting machine (10); 
c) transporting the book (26) suspended by the transporter (20) to a first module 
(12:1) of the index cutting machine (10); 
d) counting by means of said counting arrangement (32) a predetermined number of 
pages corresponding to the first index indentation which is folded down beneath the 

tongue-like element (34); 
e) transporting the book to the knife arrangement (28) in the module (12:1) for 
cutting of the first index indentation; and 
f) transporting the book (26) to a following module (12:2-12:n) of the index 
cutting machine (10) and repeating the steps d) and e) for a total of n number of times.
