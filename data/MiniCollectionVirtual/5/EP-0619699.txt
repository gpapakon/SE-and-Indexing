<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for an automated clip control device for maintaining a predetermined clip at varying ground speeds, heights of cut, and other changed conditions. The reel speed of the mower (10) is controlled based upon a feed-back control loop, using as input the ground speed of the mower (10), the actual speed of the reel (48, 50, and 52), the number of blades on the reel, and height of cut, among other factors. A microprocessor (102) uses control process equations to determine the duration of an output pulse width modulated signal which is provided to a valve (702, 706) controlling hydraulic fluid flow to the reel motor (71-75). The target value of the reel speed is determined by reading the desired height of cut value and the number of blades per reel, and then going to a look-up table which contains optimized "linear distance traveled per time grass is cut" values. Once the appropriate look-up table target value is found, the target reel speed is determined by finding the product of the number of blades on the reel times the target clip times the ground speed times a constant (to correct for units).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to turf 
maintenance, and more particularly to an automated 
controller which includes as one feature adjusting reel 
speed relative to ground speed to optimize the clip. Commercial riding lawn mowers of the type used on 
golf courses, athletic fields and the like, are 
relatively large machines which often utilize cutting 
reels as opposed to rotary blades. Typically on such 
mowers two or three cutting reels are provided across 
the front of the mower. Additionally, one or more 
cutting reels are positioned in trailing relationship 
behind the gaps between the front cutting reels. The 
cutting reels make direct contact with the grass when 
cutting, following the contour and undulations of the 
terrain as the mower moves over the ground. The Toro 
Company, which is the assignee hereof, manufactures and 
sells several examples of such mowers. Although the present invention relates to turf 
maintenance vehicles usable in a large variety of 
situations (including but not limited to cutting grass 
in parks, athletic fields, golf courses, etc.), the 
maintenance of golf courses will be utilized herein for 
the purposes of illustration. Now continuing with the 
golf course example, it will be immediately appreciated 
that cutting grass on a golf course is a recurring and 
time consuming task. Further, the particular tee or 
fairway is typically taken out of service while the 
cutting is occurring. Accordingly, it is desirable to 
drive the mower as fast as possible while maintaining 
the desired cutting height and quality of cut, since the 
ground speed of the mower while cutting is directly 
related to the time necessary to cut the particular tee 
or fairway. However, in such settings the potential 
ground speed depends upon the ability of the cutting 
reels to maintain the desired quality of cut. Those  
 
skilled in the art will appreciate that the potential 
ground speed is also affected by variations in the 
terrain, the experience of the operator, and the turf 
conditions. Still other considerations include the type 
of grass, the moisture on the grass and/or the moisture 
content of the grass, and the desired cutting height of 
the grass. In determining whether the cutting reels are 
maintaining the desired quality of cut, two broad 
categories may be considered. The first category is 
whether the cut is "clean." A clean cut may be defined 
as the absence of straggler or uncut blades of grass 
after the reel passes over the turf. A cleaner cut 
results in a
