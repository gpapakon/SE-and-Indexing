Gearwheel change transmission for motor vehicles, 
in which both a countershaft (4) and an output shaft (5), 

capable of being brought into constant drive connection 
with drivable vehicle wheels, are each arranged parallel 

to an input shaft (6) drivable from an engine, and in 
which the countershaft is in constant drive connection 

with the input shaft by means of a bound gearwheel stage 
(7), the middle gearwheel of which is arranged as a loose 

wheel (8) on the output shaft, and in which the loose 
wheel (9) of a gearwheel stage (10) of one forward gear, 

the fixed wheel (11) of which is arranged on the output 
shaft, can be coupled to the countershaft by means of a 

non-positive first shift coupling (K2), and in which the 
loose wheel (12) of a gearwheel stage (13) of a further 

forward gear, the fixed wheel (11) of which is assigned 
to the output shaft, can be coupled to the input shaft by 

means of a non-positive second shift coupling (K4), and 
in which a three-membered gearwheel stage (14) of reverse 

gear, in which the fixed wheel (15) is assigned to the 
output shaft and a middle gearwheel (25) reversing the 

direction of rotation is arranged rotatably as a 
reversing wheel on an additional intermediate shaft (16), 

can be inserted into the force flux between the input and 
output shafts by means of an additional shift coupling 

(KR) as a drive connection, characterized in that the 
gearwheel (17), used as a loose wheel, of the gearwheel 

stage (14) of the reverse gear both is arranged independently 
of the shift coupling (K4), connected to the input 

shaft (6), of the further forward gear on the  
 

countershaft (4) and can be coupled to the countershaft 
(4) by means of the additional shift coupling (KR), and 

the fixed wheel (15) of the gearwheel stage (14) of the 
reverse gear is constantly connected fixedly in terms of 

rotation to the output shaft (5), in that the fixed wheel 
(11) of the gearwheel stage (10), couplable via its loose 

wheel (9) to the countershaft (4) by means of the first 
shift coupling (K2), of the one forward gear meshes 

additionally with the loose wheel (12), couplable to the 
input shaft (6) by means of the second shift coupling 

(K4), of the gearwheel stage (13) of the further forward 

gear, and in that the fixed wheel (15) of the gearwheel 
stage (14) of the reverse gear meshes additionally with 

the loose wheel (19) which is associated with a gearwheel 
stage (18) of a third forward gear and which can be 

coupled to the input shaft (6) by means of a non-positive 
fourth shift coupling (K3). 
Gearwheel change transmission according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the shift coupling (KR) used as 

a connection between the loose wheel (17) of the 
gearwheel stage (14) of the reverse gear and the 

countershaft (4) is non-positive.
