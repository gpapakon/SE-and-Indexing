<ABSTRACT>
Two annular guide bearings (28, 30) that guide a needle (34) are mounted in a tube (26) disposed in a bore (33) of a valve body (12) to provide improved alignment of the bearings with a valve seat (44) and a solenoid actuator (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrically operated valves, such
as fuel injectors for injecting fuel into an internal combustion engine, and
particularly to a bearing cartridge for such a valve.The movement of certain electrically-operated valves, such as
certain fuel injectors, comprises a needle that is reciprocated axially within
the interior of the valve's body in response to electrical energization and
de-energization of an electro-mechanical actuator to thereby selectively
open and close a flow path through the valve. The needle of some fuel
injectors has a rounded tip end that, when the actuator is not energized,
seats on a frusto-conical valve seat at the fuel injector's nozzle end to
close a flow path through the fuel injector. When the actuator is
energized, the needle is axially displaced to unseat its tip end from the
seat and thereby open the flow path. The typical actuator is a solenoid
that is mounted on the valve body and that has a guided armature to
which the needle is operatively connected.Such a fuel injector also comprises two axially spaced apart
bearings that, in conjunction with the guided armature provide guidance
for the axial reciprocation of the needle. For assuring proper operation
and avoiding leakage when the flow path is closed, the precision and
alignment of such bearing arrangements is vital. First, the bearings
individually need to be highly circular. Second, they must be highly
concentric, not just with each other, but also with the guided armature and
the valve seat. Third, the bearings' cylindricity must be highly precise,
particularly, if they have a significant length/diameter ratio. Lack of
precision in the individual bearings and in their mounting arrangement on
the valve body is apt to lead to loss of a fuel injector's performance. For
example, faults may appear as objectionable wear, if the tolerance in the
clearance of the fit between the needle and the bearings is not sufficiently
strict; as objectionable leakage, if the bearings are eccentric to the valve
seat, even if the bearings themselves are correctly mutually concentrically 
aligned; as needle jamming, if the bearings are misaligned or lack proper
cylindricity; or as erratic dynamic flow, if the bearing/needle clearance is
too loose and the bearings are not sufficiently precisely aligned.Since the bearings mount on the valve body, the process of
manufacturing the valve body and/or the valve body's constructional
features may have an effect on the ability to secure precise bearing
alignment. For
