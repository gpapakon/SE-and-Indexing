<ABSTRACT>
For motor-vehicle doors which are suspended on the vehicle body by means of an articulated parallelogram so as to be pivotable about two axes, in such a way that, during the opening and closing of the door, it will execute, in each case, a pivoting movement on which a transverse movement is superposed, there is proposed a door-locking device which comprises at least two rotary latches, there being arranged on each of the two door end faces at least one rotary latch cooperating with a [lacuna] on the associated door column, A-column and B-column, and the two rotary latches being coupled to one another by means of a drive connection, and, furthermore, a length adjuster being inserted into the drive connection between the two rotary latches.

<CLAIMS>
Door closing system for motor vehicle doors, which are
hung on the vehicle body so as to be able to pivot

around two axes by means of a parallelogram-type
coupling, comprising at least one support part and at

least one control part, in such a manner that they
respectively perform a pivoting movement superposed by a

transverse movement upon opening and closure of the
doors, and in which at least one fixed closing strap or

closing bolt (1 and 2) is respectively arranged on the
two door pillars defining a door opening in the 
vehicle
body, in particular A and B pillar, and at least one

respective rotary latch (3 and 4) is arranged on both
face ends of the vehicle doors, the first being formed

by the lock latch (3) of the door lock and the second
being formed by a rotary latch (4) of catch-like

construction, whereby the two rotary latches (3 and 4)
stand in driving connection with one another via drive

connection means (30) transmitting pressure and tensile
forces in such a way that the first rotary latch (3) is

the driving latch and the second rotary latch (4) is the
driven latch,

and whereby the two rotary latches (3 and 4)
respectively have an engagement area (11 and 12)

characterising a capture or initial latching position of
the doors and a closing or locking position of the

doors, and at least one of the two rotary latches (3 and
4) has an adjustable pivoting restriction means

determining their end positions allocated to it, this
pivoting restriction means being formed by the drive

connection means (30).
Door closing system according to Claim 1, characterised
in that a means (33) for adjusting the effective length

of the drive connection means or the effective length of 
one of its parts is connected into the drive connection

means (30) forming the drive connection between the two
rotary latches (3 and 4).
Door closing system according to Claim 1 and 2,
characterised in that the drive connection means

connecting the two rotary latches (3 and 4) to one
another is formed by a Bowden cable (30), whereby the

casing of the Bowden cable (30) forms the pivoting
restriction means for at least one of the two

interconnected rotary latches (3 and 4) and is divided
into two length sections (31 and 32) interconnected by

means of a length adjustment means (33).
Door closing system according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the length adjustment means (33) comprises a

first part (34) connected against rotation and torsion
to one length section (31) of the casing of the Bowden

cable (30) and a second part (35) also connected against
rotation and torsion to the other length section (32) of

the casing of the Bowden cable (30), whereby the two
parts of the length adjustment means (33) are

interconnected via a screw thread so as to be adjustable
in length.
Door closing system according to Claim 4, characterised
in that the first part of the length adjustment means

(33) connected against rotation and torsion to one
length section (31) of the casing of the Bowden cable

(30) is formed by a threaded casing (34) having an
external thread, and the second part also connected

against rotation and torsion to the other length section
(32) of the casing of the Bowden cable (30) comprises a

housing (35) having an internal thread (36). 
Door closing system according to Claim 3 to 5,
characterised in that a drive system assuring fine

adjustability is connected in the length adjustment
means (33) connecting the two length sections (31 and

32) of the casing of the Bowden cable (30) to one
another.
Door closing system according to Claim 6, characterised
in that the internal thread (36) provided in the part of

the length adjustment means (33) formed by a housing
(35) is arranged in an adjustment wheel (38), which is

provided with outer peripheral profiling, is aligned
coaxially to the threaded casing (34) and is rotatably

mounted in the housing (35).
Door closing system according to Claim 7, characterised
in that the outer peripheral profiling of the adjustment

wheel (38), which is aligned coaxially to the threaded
casing (34) and rotatably mounted in the housing (35),

is formed by a peripheral tooth arrangement (37) and
meshes with a drive worm (39) itself rotatably mounted

in the housing (35).
Door closing system according to Claim 8, characterised
in that the shaft member (40) housing the drive worm

(39) in the housing (35) and connecting with the drive
worm (39) against rotation, in particular constructed in

one piece, projects above the housing (35) with at least
one of its ends and at its end projecting above the

housing (35) is equipped with a tool attachment, in
particular a slot (41).
Door closing system according to one of Claims 5 to 9,
characterised in that a rotation locking means is 

allocated to the threaded casing (34) penetrating into
the housing (35) and connected to one length section

(31) of the casing of the Bowden cable (30) against
rotation and torsion.
Door closing system according to Claim 10, characterised
in that the rotation locking means allocated to the

threaded casing (34) penetrating into the housing (35)
is formed by a headless screw (42) engaging into a

longitudinal groove (44) of the threaded casing (34).
