<ABSTRACT>
Dry, particulate abrasive for use in abrasive blast 
cleaning of a ship hull (16,26) is supplied to blasting pots 

(36) from abrasive supply hopper assemblies (38,40) lifted 
into place from a recycling station (34). Spent abrasive, 

with debris, is collected and placed on a conveyor belt (28) 
extending parallel to the keel blocks (18), for conveying the 

collected material to the recycling station (34). There, the 
collected material is processed to remove undersized and 

foreign material from the reuseable abrasive grit. The latter 
is loaded into supply hopper assemblies (38,40), which are 

crane-lifted back into supplying relation with respective 
blasting pots (36). By preference, the abrasive blasting work 

takes place from elevatable, curtain-enclosed platforms (70) 
supported on a drydock floor (12), the blasting pots (36) are 

located on the drydock wing wall (14), the abrasive grit is 
ferromagnetic and recovered from the drydock floor (12) partly 

with the aid of a magnetic abrasive pick-up unit (112), and 
the recycling station (34) is located on a barge (32) moored 

at an end of the drydock (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
and a method of performing external surface work on
ship hulls.In general, the invention relates to providing an
atmospherically controlled sealed enclosure which
permits economical staging access to and coating of
exposed areas of ships' hulls of varying
configurations both afloat and in drydock during the
abrasive blasting, spray painting and solvent
evaporation phases of the coating process so as to be,
so far as practically possible, in full compliance
with requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean
Water Act.The present invention relates to apparatus and a
method for supplying abrasive blast media to workers
working inside an enclosure, retrieving and recycling
used abrasive, which improve upon the apparatus and
methods which are disclosed in U.S. patent US-A-5,211,125
(Garland et al), issued May 18, 1993
corresponding to EP-A-0539212, and other copending
patent applications EP-A-0597643 and EP-A-0614802.
These are collectively referred to herein as the
baseline apparatus and methods.Ships' hulls are very large and are complexly
contoured in both the vertical and longitudinal
directions. The world's population of ships has a
very significant number of different sizes and shapes.Coating of the exterior of ships requires using
abrasive blasters for surface preparation and painters
for application of paint. Both blasters and 
painters must be brought into close proximity to the
portion of the hull they are working. Neither
blasters nor painters can perform their work on much
more than 75 square feet of hull surface without
moving or being moved to another location.In earlier times, worker movement from place
to place around a ship's hull was accommodated by
building staging around the ship.Also, in earlier times, the coating of the
exterior hull above the waterline was most often done
with the ship afloat. However, enactment in the U.S.
of the Clean Water Acts all but eliminated this
practice since coating of this area of a ship afloat
deposited significantly more spent abrasive and paint
overspray in the water than did coating in a drydock.More recently, required worker movement has
been accomplished through the use of manlifts. A
conventional manlift includes a staging basket mounted
on an arm which has the capability of being
hydraulically lifted, extended and rotated; this arm
being mounted on a carriage powered by an internal
combustion engine. The carriage has the capability of
being moved from place to place on a horizontal
surface.Even
