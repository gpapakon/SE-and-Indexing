<CLAIMS>
A pulley (1) which has a substantially pot-shaped 
profile and is bounded at least in the axial direction on 

one side by an integrally moulded-on rim disc (2), the rim 
disc (2) being connected to an inertia ring (6) by means of 

a damping ring (5) made of elastomer material, and the rim 
disc (2) extending substantially in the radial direction and 

being connected to the damping ring (5) and the inertia ring 
(6) on the side facing away from the belt running surface 

(7), characterized in that - viewed in cross-section - the 
inertia ring (6) is of angular design and is fixed by its 

axial projection (9) on the inner side of the belt running 
surface (7) by means of the integrally designed, 

correspondingly shaped damping ring (5), in that the damping 
ring (5) covers the end face of the axial projection (9) and 

extends up to the base of the pot-shaped pulley (1), in that 
the elastomer material of the damping ring(5) is fixed only 

on the axial projection (9) or on the pulley (1) so that 
the elastomer material is supported in a non-adhering and 

sliding manner on the opposite side in the axial direction. 
A pulley according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
inertia ring (6) consists of sheet-metal and is provided 

with a bead-shaped thickening (8) in the region of its outer 
circumferential boundary. 
A pulley according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
thickening (8) consists of the shaped sheet-metal edge of 

the inertia ring (6). 
A pulley according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the sheet-metal edge is flanged. 
A pulley according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the belt running surface (7) and the 

axial projection (9) extend parallel to each other, and in 
that the rim disc (2) and the axially adjacent radial  

 
projection (10) of the inertia ring (6) bound a gap (11) 

which, as its radial extent increases, has an increasing 
axial width.
