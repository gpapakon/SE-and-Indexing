<ABSTRACT>
The fastener head recess has a pair of 
radial slots (16, 18) formed in the head (12), a ledge 

(20) in each recess being located a short distance 
axially below the head surface (13) and extending a 

predetermined angular length from the axial portion of 
the ledge (20). The dimension of the ledge (20) is 

adjustable to accommodate the strength of fastener 
material in a manner such that the displacement 

formation of recess material on the surface (13) of the 
fastener head (12) is prevented during normal 

installation procedures. The drive angle on the recess 
is designed to be zero degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recessed fastener heads and,
in particular, to a fastener head having a radial slot
configuration, each slot configuration having a ledge formed below
the head surface.Most prior art internal wrenching recesses perform adequately
when installation and removal torque loads are low and if the
fastener material is at higher strength levels. Often at these
higher strength levels the results of repeated usage shows some
recess distortion and indications of recess material displacement.
However, when the same recess is fabricated from a softer material
that has high malleability characteristics, one torsional cycle
often is sufficient to deform the recess configuration to cause the
raised material (burrs) to appear on the fastener head surface.
Repeated drive tool usage often results in camout and destruction
of the recess making the fastener useless. Deformation of the
recess usually begins at the junction of the recess and the surface
head of the fastener, and displays itself by a deformed edge of
raised material. This raised material is unsightly, can inflict
some minor physical damage to persons who contact the area where
the fastener is installed, and with regards to aerodynamic
smoothness, is unacceptable.All materials will deform to some extent when the load exceeds 
the yield point, but if the load is constant for all materials, it
becomes readily obvious that softer materials will deform much more
easily than harder materials. Currently available internal driving
recesses do not take in account fastener material strength in order
to minimize recess deformation and are configured identically the
same for soft or hard materials. In other types of recesses, the
installation tool is inserted into the mating internal wrenching
recess. As torque is applied, contact between the tool's driving
surface is resisted by the recess reacting surface. As torque
increases and the fastener is seated, continuous torque could cause
deformation to the upper surface of the recess. The reason for the
deformation is the fact that this is the portion of the recess that
has the weakest unsupported area and is susceptible to movement.It is also noted that some prior art fastener recesses have
drive angles ranging from fifteen to ninety degrees. The drive
angle is the resultant radial force transmitted by the wrenching
tool to the fastener material of the recess. As an example, the
hexagon recess internal wrenching tool, commercially available, has
six external corners. When these corners
