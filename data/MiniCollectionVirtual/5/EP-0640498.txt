<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire having a block design suited for 
off-road use, modified to improve rolling resistance 

and noise properties when used on paved surfaces, has 
a tread design having angled lateral grooves between 

the blocks in each circumferential row of blocks in 
the tread. Narrow grooves separate the blocks in 

several of the rows of blocks, and tie bars are 
present in the lateral grooves separating blocks in 

other rows of blocks. Void areas in the shoulder area 
of the tire enhance traction in mud and sand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pneumatic tire treads as 
well as to pneumatic radial tires comprising such a 
tread, such tires being suited for use on or off-road. Off-road tires tend to have an aggressive, all 
block tread pattern, which provides good traction by 
digging into the ground. When used on paved surfaces, 
however, the tires cause a rough ride and tend to be 
very noisy. Partly because of the roughness of the 
ride, such tires have a high rolling resistance on 
paved surfaces. It is known in the art that ribbed tires, i.e. 
tires having continuous "ribs" of tread rubber 
annularly around the tread, provide a smooth quiet 
ride on paved surfaces. Such tires provide poor 
performance when used off-road since there are no 
aggressive blocks for digging into the ground. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
tire that provides good off-road traction, while 
providing a quiet, smooth ride on paved surfaces, as 
compared to conventional off-road tires. It is a further object to provide a tire tread 
having an improved rolling resistance, as compared to 
conventional tires used off-road. The tire of the invention comprises at least a 
pair of annular beads, at least one carcass ply 
wrapped around the beads, a ground contacting tread 
portion disposed over the carcass ply in a crown area 
of the tire and sidewalls disposed between the tread  
 
and the beads. In one embodiment, the ground 
contacting portion of the tread has five rows of 
blocks annularly around the tire comprising two rows 
of shoulder blocks, a center row of blocks and two 
intermediate rows of blocks. The center row of blocks 
corresponds substantially with the equatorial plane 
(EP) of the tire and narrow grooves between blocks in 
the center row have a width of 1% to 5% of the length 
of a block. Similar narrow grooves separate at least 
a portion of the shoulder blocks. In a second embodiment, the ground contacting 
part of the tread has four rows of blocks annularly 
around the tire comprising two rows of shoulder blocks 
and two intermediate rows of blocks. A center groove 
corresponds substantially with the equatorial plane of 
the tire. Narrow grooves, having a width of about 1% 
to 5% of the length of an intermediate block separate 
at least a portion of the shoulder blocks. In the illustrated embodiments of the invention, 
narrow lateral grooves in the shoulder rows of blocks 
(and in the center row of blocks in the first 
embodiment) are angled in substantially the same 
direction with respect to the EP of the

tread portion (11) comprising circumferentially and 

laterally extending grooves defining at least four 
circumferentially extending rows (31-35) of blocks (21-25) 

comprising 
two rows (34,35) of shoulder blocks and at least two 

intermediate rows (32,33) of blocks adjacent to said rows of 
shoulder blocks, characterized 


in that a first set of laterally extending grooves (44) 
having a width of 1% to 5% of the block length 

separate at least a portion of the blocks (24,25) in said 
shoulder rows (34,35) of blocks; and 
in that a second set of laterally extending grooves (41) 
having a width of 8% to 25% of the block length and

the blocks in said intermediate rows of blocks, the 

first and second set of grooves being angled in 
substantially the opposite direction with respect to 

the equatorial plane EP.

sipes (47,48) oriented substantially parallel to said 
EP.
