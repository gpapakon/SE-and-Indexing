<ABSTRACT>
In a pressure meter, actuation of a microswitch (7) 
takes place upon command of a movable element (11) 

having a plate-like conformation, disposed in a plane 
parallel to a base wall (15) being part of a support 

structure (2) carrying the microswitch (7). Interposed 
between the movable element (11) and base wall (15) is a 

plenum chamber element (16) consisting of two 
polyethylene layers (16a, 16b) heat sealed along their 

edges (16c), inside which a branching chamber ("C") is 
defined which communicates with the environment the 

pressure variations of which are to be checked. Pressure 
variations in the environment to be checked cause, when 

a given threshold is overcome, the displacement of the 
movable element (11) in a direction opposite to that 

resulting from the action of its own weight and an 
optional preloading spring (14), so that the microswitch 

(7) is operated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-sensitivity and 
accuracy pressure meter, of the type comprising: a 
support structure: a switching member engaged to the 
support structure and operatively associated with a 
signalling circuit for selectively switching over said 
circuit from a first use condition to a second use 
condition and vice versa; transducer means put into 
fluid communication with an environment to be checked so 
that, upon pressure variations in the environment 
itself, switching-over of the signalling circuit 
between the first and second use conditions is caused 
upon command of the switching member. In particular, the pressure meter in reference is 
designed to be used when very low pressure variations 
need to be detected in environments in which the actual 
pressure, that is the detectable difference in pressure 
relative to the surrounding atmosphere is very limited 
too, in the range of 0.05 to 3 millibar. It is known that pressure meters generally provide the 
use of a switching member, usually consisting of a 
microswitch engaged to a support structure and operable 
upon command of transducer means put into fluid 
communication with an environment to be checked for the 
purpose of causing, following pressure variations in 
said environment, switching of the operating state of an 
electric signalling circuit connected to the 
microswitch. In particular, the transducer means usually 
comprises a diaphragm made of elastomeric material, 
sealingly engaged on the periphery thereof to an 
appropriate support structure so that the opposite faces 
of said diaphragm respectively communicate with one 
environment which is generally the environment the 
pressure of which is to be checked, and a second 
environment which is generally the outside atmosphere.  Thus the diaphragm is subjected to elastic deformation 
as a result of variations in the differential pressure 
taking place between the two environments. The deformations in the diaphragm give rise to an axial 
displacement of a transducer rod slidably guided in the 
support structure and acting on the microswitch so as to 
cause switching of the operating state of the electric 
circuit when the differential pressure exceeds a 
predetermined threshold. The foregoing being stated, it is to be pointed out that 
the use of the above described pressure meters brings 
about several problems and difficulties in those cases 
in which switching of the electric circuit is required 
following very low variations in the differential 
pressure,
