<ABSTRACT>
A contents which can be compressed in a vertical 
direction is tightly wound. Upon descending of the 

elevator 1, the compressive receiving plates 3, 3 are 
projected above the contents B, thereafter the elevator 

1 is ascended to hold the contents B between the 
compressive receiving plates 3, 3, thereby the contents 

B is compressed in the vertical direction, the winding 
guides 2, 2 are approached to each other while the 

contents B is being compressed, both ends A1, A2 of the 
packaging sheet A are connected by the fixing means C1, 

C2, C2 and then the compressive receiving plates 3, 3 
are pulled out.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wrapping packaging apparatus or device for use in covering
substantially rectangular shaped contents with a packaging sheet of craft paper or the like.It is known that contents comprising piled-up items, for example, piled-up papers, books,
clothes, zigzag folded fabrics or accumulated boxes, can be wrapped by being placed above a
packaging sheet which in turn is above an elevator, followed by the folding of the packaging sheet
in a substantial U-shape so that it lies along the bottom and side surfaces of the contents by
descending the elevator. To complete the wrapping, both ends of the packaging sheet are folded
along the upper surface of the contents and are sealed together.An example of this kind of packaging device is disclosed in the gazette of Japanese Utility
Model Publication No. 3-11125, which discloses a system in which the packaging sheet is
supplied onto the elevator as it is ascending. The contents are manually placed at a predetermined
position on the packaging sheet after the elevator has stopped at an upper limit position, following
which, a switch is manually operated to cause the elevator to be lowered. As a result, both ends of
the packaging sheet are folded onto the sides of the contents so that the sheet takes up a
substantial U-shape, around the contents, and thereafter the contents are transported horizontally.
A frictional rotating member is abutted against one end of the folded packaging sheet and the
frictional rotation member is rotated, thereby one end of the packaging sheet is pushed back in the
opposite direction to that in which the contents are moving, and at the same time, the other end
of the packaging sheet folded on the upper surface of the contents, is caused to pass below
another frictional rotating member, whereby the other end of the packaging sheet is forcibly 
pushed in the direction of movement of the contents and under the frictional resistance of these
two members the packaging sheet is folded, and thereafter an adhering tape is adhered to both
ends of the packaging sheet so that the sheet remains wrapped without any looseness.In addition, there is disclosed in each of Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-14685, and
Japanese Patent Publication No. JP-A-63-125111, a device in which the packaging sheet is
supplied onto the elevator during its ascending operation, and after the elevator is stopped at its
upper limit position, the contents are manually placed at a predetermined position on the
packaging sheet. A switch is manually

<CLAIMS>
A packaging apparatus of the type for the wrapping of a substantially rectangular shaped
article (B), wherein a wrapping sheet is positioned above an elevator (1) of the apparatus and the

article (B) is positioned above the sheet (A), and the sheet (A) is folded into U-shape around the
bottom surface (B4) and the opposing sides (B1, B1) of the article (B) by lowering the elevator

(1), sheet (A) and article (B) together in a descending path to a descended position, the apparatus
comprising wrapping guides (2) having inner ends (2b) and being mounted for reciprocation towards

and away from each other over the upper surface of the article (B) when in the descended position
to cause the inner ends (2a) to wrap the ends of the sheet over the upper surface of the article and

fix them together, characterized in that the apparatus includes compressing plates (3) arranged to
lie between the wrapping guides (2) and the top surface (B3) of the article (A) when in the

descended position, said plates (3) being mounted for movement into and out of the descending
path so that they can be positioned selectively above the article upper surface (B3), and the

elevator (1) can be ascended from the descended position to compress the article (B) against the
said plates (3) whilst the ends of the sheet (A) are wrapped by the wrapping guide ends (2a) over

the article (B) and are fixed together.
A packaging device according to Claim 1 wherein the elevator (1) is adapted to be slightly
descended to enable the compressing plates (3) to be moved out of the descending path.
A packaging device according to Claim 1 including sheet pressers (2d) reciprocally
arranged to be moved towards and away from the upper surface of the wrapping guides (2).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 including a packaging start position (P1) from which the
elevator (1), sheet (A) and article (B) together are descended to the descended position and the

wrapping guides (2) form the sheet (A) to tubular form around the article (B), and including a
transporting means (4) for horizontally transporting the article (B) and the sheet (A) in tubular

form along the mounting surface (1a) of the elevator (1) when in the descended position to an 
intermediate position under a packaging completion position (P2), said elevator (1) being

arranged to raise the article (B) and sheet (A) from the intermediate position to the packaging
completed position (P2) which is adjacent the packaging start position (P1), and further including

end folding means (5, 6, 7) for folding each of the ends of the tubular form sheet (A) along the
adjacent end of the article (B) as the article advances from the descended position through to the

packaging complete position (P2).
Apparatus according to Claim 4 in which there is provided a guiding passage (A1)
extending between the packaging start position (P1) and the packaging complete (P2) position.
