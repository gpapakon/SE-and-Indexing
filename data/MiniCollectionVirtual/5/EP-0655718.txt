<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a POS system which employs a purchased commodity 
accommodating and transporting apparatus having a self scanning function and 

is improved in that the access time for data transfer processing is reduced 
to reduce the time required for settlement of accounts and complete transfer 

of data is assured to enhance the reliability. A two-dimensional bar code 
printing section (7) is provided on the purchased commodity accommodating 

and transporting apparatus (1) and prints commodity code information from a

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a POS system which
employs a purchased commodity accommodating and
transporting apparatus such as a shopping cart (hand
cart) or a shopping basket for use in the distribution
industry, particularly in a store such a mass sales
store, a convenience store or a supermarket to allow a
customer to accommodate and transport a purchased
commodity, and more particularly to a POS system which
employs a purchased commodity accommodating and
transporting apparatus (scanning cart) having a self
scanning function to allow a customer to purchase a
commodity while the customer himself reads a commodity
code such as a bar code applied to the commodity.Generally, a POS system is employed in various
stores such as supermarkets and convenience stores. In
the POS system, a customer walks around in a store
pushing a shopping cart or carrying a shopping basket,
places commodities to be purchased into the shopping
cart or the shopping basket, and comes to a settlement
POS terminal (POS register).Then at the settlement POS terminal, an operator 
takes out the commodities one by one from the shopping
cart or the shopping basket and reads the bar codes
(commodity codes) applied to the commodities by means of
a scanner to effect registration processing. In
particular, in accordance with commodity code
information read from each bar code, the price of the
commodity corresponding to the commodity code is
retrieved from a commodity price file (PLU (Price Look
Up) file), and a total amount of money of the purchased
commodities is calculated to settle the accounts.With such POS system, however, since an operator
must perform a reading operation of a commodity code of
each commodity, much time is required for such reading
operation and a settling operation, which causes the
customer to wait for a long time. Accordingly, in a
time band in which customers are crowded, a queue of
customers is produced in front of a settlement POS
terminal, and besides, the burden on the operator is
heavy.Thus, in recent years, a shopping cart (scanning
cart) or a shopping basket having a scanner (commodity
code reading section) for reading a bar code (commodity
code) applied to a commodity has been developed and are
disclosed in various publications including, for
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Applications No.
Showa 63-145591, No. Heisei 2-277412 and No. Heisei 5-81559. In a POS system which employs a shopping cart or
a shopping basket of the type mentioned, a customer
itself reads a bar code applied to a commodity to be
