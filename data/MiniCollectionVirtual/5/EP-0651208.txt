<ABSTRACT>
Enamelled baking and roasting oven muffle (1), in particular for electrically heated ovens with pyrolytic self-cleaning, the opening region (2) of which, closeable by means of a door (3), is bordered by a U-shaped muffle frame (4), of which one U-limb (5) is welded to the muffle wall (1') and of which the part (7) connecting the two U-limbs (5, 6) has a bead (8) for a door seal (18). In order to prevent the occurrence of tensile stresses in the flange region of the oven muffle, a stiffening connection (9) is established between the part (7) of the U-shaped muffle frame (4) connecting the two U-limbs (5, 6) and the muffle wall (1').

<CLAIMS>
An enamelled baking and roasting oven muffle (1), in particular for electrically 
heated cookers with catalytic self-cleaning, whose aperture region (2) closable with a 

door (3) is encompassed by a U-shaped muffle frame (4), whose one U arm (5) is 
welded to the muffle wall (1') and whose part (7) connecting the two U arms (5, 6) has 

a bead (8) for a door seal (18), characterised in that between the part (7) of the U-shaped 
muffle frame (4) connecting the two arms of the U, a reinforcing joint (9) is 

produced. 
Baking and roasting muffle according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
reinforcing joint (9) consists of an angle profile rail (10), whose one flange (10') is 

welded to the muffle wall (1') and whose other flange (10") is welded to the muffle 
frame (4). 
Baking and roasting muffle according to claim 2, characterised in that the angle 
profile rail (10) is welded to the base convexity (8') of the muffle frame bead (8). 
Baking and roasting muffle according to claim 1, characterised in that the reinforcing 
joint (9) is produced in the aperture region (2) of the oven muffle (1) by a flange edge 

(11) associated with the muffle frame (4) and bent up vertically. 
Baking and roasting muffle according to claim 4, characterised in that the muffle 
flange edge (11) is welded to the base convexity (8') of the bead (8).
