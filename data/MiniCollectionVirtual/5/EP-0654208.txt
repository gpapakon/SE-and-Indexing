<ABSTRACT>
The appts. has a number of parallel, spaced, co-rotating separator rolls (13-19) which are arranged transversely to the direction (20) of travel of the appts. and which have radial fingers (23). The rollers rotate in mutually axially offset staggered planes. The separator roller (13-19) are height adjustable relative to one another and pref. have an adjustable spacing between their axes. The inclination of the appts. to the soil surface may also be variable. All rollers may be driven by a chain drive.

An apparatus (6) for separating stones and/or root crops from earth, with a
number of separating rollers (13 to 19) disposed serially and at intervals from one another

crosswise to the direction (20) in which excavated earth is fed to the apparatus (6), the
said rollers being orientated parallel with one another and being driven to rotate in the

same direction as one another, being constructed as toothed rollers having approximately
radially orientated lingers (23) which respectively rotate in planes which are axially offset

and staggered in respect of one another from one separating roller to the next,
characterised in that the separating rollers (13 to 19) can be adjusted vertically in respect

of one another.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the interval between the
axes (23) of the separating rollers (13 to 19) can be adjusted in and against the direction

(20) in which the apparatus (6) is fed.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the even-numbered
separating rollers (14, 16, 18) are supported in such a way as to be adjustable in the

sequence of separating rollers (13 to 19) which coincides with the direction (20) in which
the apparatus (6) is fed.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the adjustable
separating rollers (14, 16, 18) are at their ends respectively mounted on a common

positioning member (27, 28) and can be adjusted jointly in height and/or distance between
their axes in relation to those of the odd-numbered separating rollers (13, 15, 17, 19).
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that for their
vertical adjustment, the adjustable separating rollers (14, 16, 18) can be displaced downwards

out of a plane common with the rigidly supported separating rollers (13, 15, 17,
19). 
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that starting with
the separating roller (14) which is second in the direction (20) in which the apparatus (6)

is fed, the adjustable separating rollers (14, 16, 18) can be vertically adjusted.
An apparatus according to claim 3 and 6, characterised in that by means of the
Positioning members (27, 28), it is possible for the distance between the axes (26) of the

even-numbered separating rollers in relation to those of the odd-numbered separating rollers
(13, 15, 17, 19) to be adjusted jointly in and against the direction (20) in which the

apparatus (6) is fed, but independently of any vertical adjustment.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6, characterised in that the
even-numbered and/or the odd-numbered separating rollers (13 to 19) are supported to

be adjustable individually in and against the direction (20) in which the apparatus (6) is
fed.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the angle of
inclination of the apparatus (6) is adjustable in relation to ground level.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that a chain
transmission (47) common to all separating rollers (13 to 19) is provided with a

compensating and tensioning device (53).
An apparatus according to claim 10, characterised in that the chain transmission
(47) is guided in encapsulated manner in a part of an apparatus housing (12) which is

constructed as a box member.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that it forms a
constituent part of a mobile working appliance (1) which has an earth-receiving means (5)

upstream of the separating rollers. 
An apparatus according to claim 12, characterised in that the working appliance
(1) comprises a screening belt (7) downstream of the separating rollers.
An apparatus according to claim 13, characterised in that downstream of the
screening belt (7) of the working appliance (1) there is a lateral conveyor (8), a transfer

grid (9) engaging over this latter and a bin (10) on the downstream side of the grid (9).
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterised in that each
separating roller (13 to 19) comprises a polygonal shaft (24) and stellate members (25)

arranged adjacent one another on the said shaft (24).
An apparatus according to claim 15, characterised in that the end of the polygonal
shaft (24) of the separating roller
s (13 to 19) on the chain transmission side of the
apparatus (6) is pushed into a bearing socket (63) and can be withdrawn therefrom

towards the side remote from the chain transmission (47) for dismantling purposes.
