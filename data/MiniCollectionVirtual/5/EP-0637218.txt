<ABSTRACT>
A guide wire (15) for supporting monopolar arcing for cutting tissue and for ablating occlusions includes a flexible metal wire (302) including a distal end, an electrically insulating coating (306) extending along the wire, and an electrically and thermally insulating tip (310) having a distal end and attached to the wire, the wire extending through the electrically and thermally insulating tip and forming an electrode (312) at the distal ends of the wire and the tip. An electrosurgical apparatus for cutting tissue and for ablating occlusions includes a pulse generator (5, 6) having a variable output impedance for selectively generating a train of pulses of electrical energy for application to a guide wire (15) having an attached electrode. The pulse generator senses the load impedance and adjusts the output impedance to match the load impedance. The generator measures the relative electrical energy produced by an arc in response to a pulse, compares the relative electrical energy to a predetermined value to determine an energy difference, and adjusts the energy of a subsequent pulse to reduce the energy difference toward zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROSURGICAL APPARATUS AND METHODTechnical FieldThe present invention concerns an electrosurgi- cal apparatus and method for ablating tissue and occlusions, particularly within liquid-filled lumens and organs of animals, such as arteries and vessels of a human, with an electrical arc produced at an electrode and without damaging adjacent tissue. More particularly, the invention concerns (i) an apparatus providing an impedance match between an electrosurgical electrode and its environs and the source of electrical pulses and controllably adjusting the electrical energy of the pulses to produce an arc of desired energy, (ii) a guide wire having an electrode for supporting monopolar arcing, particularly within a lumen, and (iii) a method of supplying pulsed energy for cutting tissue and ablating occlusions without damaging adjacent tissue.Background ArtThe use of electrical arcing in surgical proce¬ dures has been known for some time. In one external application, an electrical scalpel, sometimes re- 

ferred to as a Bovee knife, is employed to simulta¬ neously make an incision and cauterize the incised tissue. In the use of that apparatus, a surgeon can visually observe the arcing between the knife and tissues and the cutting of the tissue. The surgeon can make adjustments in the position of the scalpel or in the electrical signal for controllably making and cauterizing an incision. For example, if the arc is observed to be too strong, either the elec- trical energy supplied to the scalpel can be reduced or the scalpel can be moved to a position farther from the tissue.Electrical ablation of occlusions within lumens, such as arteries and vessels, has also been known for some time. In that technique, a wire, catheter, or other implement, generically referred to here as a wire, having an electrode at its end is inserted into a vessel or artery and moved to a po¬ sition adjacent an occlusion. Once an occlusion is encountered, electrical energy, usually in the form of pulses, is supplied to the electrode so that arc¬ ing occurs. The plaque forming the occlusion is vaporized or reduced to very small particles if the arcing ablation proceeds as intended. In some appa- ratus, for example, the type described in U. S. Pat¬ ent 4,682,596 to Bales et al, a bipolar catheter is employed. In a bipolar catheter, two wires are in¬ serted in the lumen and two electrically isolated electrodes are present at the end of the catheter. Arcing occurs between the two electrodes. In other known apparatus, an example of which
