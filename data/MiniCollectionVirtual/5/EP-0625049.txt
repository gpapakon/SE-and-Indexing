<ABSTRACT>
A method for delivering a polypeptide to the interior of a cell of a vertebrate ex vivo is provided comprising the steps of: removing live cells from the vertebrate, contacting the cells with a preparation comprising an effective amount of polynucleotide operatively coding for the polypeptide and lipid effective to deliver the polynucleotide in the cells; and freezing or returning the cells to the vertebrate within 48 hours after the contacting step so that the cells express the polynucleotide in vivo. The method additionally can comprise substantially separating the cells from the surrounding extracellular matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EX VIVO GENE TRANSFER Field of the Invention The present invention relates to methods for delivering polynucleotide to the interior of a cell of a vertebrate ex vivo. In particular this invention is directed - rapid and convenient methods for introducing genetic material into cells, which may then be returned to the vertebrate. The genetic material may be introduced into the cell to correct a functional cellular defect, to augment an immune response or to express a foreign protein.Background of the Invention Gene transfer is a term that broadly encompasses methods for the introduction of gene sequences into a cell or group of cells. There are a variety of methods currently in use to introduce exogenous genetic material into cells. These methods include calcium precipitation, viral vector-mediated delivery, electroporation and liposome-mediated delivery.Gene transfer in vitro is used to study the effect of a given gene and its resulting gene product on a given population of cells. Early work in the field of gene transfer was directed to the areas of gene replacement and augmentation. Gene augmentation includes approaches for introducing a correct copy of a mutated gene into defective cells or a copy of a foreign sequence for gene expression within that cell. Gene replacement includes approaches to correct defective genetic sequences through site-specific recombination, thus permitting targeted homologous recombination for a known gene sequence. It is generally assumed that both approaches require the stable expression of exogenous polynucleotide sequences.Following transfection, cells stably expressing the polypeptide encoded from the transfected gene are selected for further analysis. Examples of stable transfectants selected for gene therapy directed to skeletal muscle and hematopoietic cells are found, in publications by Sal inen et al. and Dick et al. (Hum. Gene Ther. 2:15-26, 1991 and Blood 78:624-634, 1991 

respectively) which are hereby incorporated by reference. Stable expression is thought to require either stable integration or homologous recombination of DNA into the host chromosome, although there is some evidence that polynucleotide formed as episomal-like structures may be able to direct the stable expression of polypeptide as well.There are a variety of methods, known to those with skill in the art, for introducing genetic material into a host cell. Viral vectors encapsulated in virus particles are among the more efficient methods for gene delivery. Many viral vectors require gene
