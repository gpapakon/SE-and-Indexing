<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for drawing on textile articles of elongate shape consists of three essential elements, namely the transfer station (3), the drawing-on station (7) and the synchronously working drawing-on rollers (24). The transfer hooks (4) located at the transfer station (3) and moving about their own axes and, in the case of socks, the hooks (4a) transfer the stocking (2) to the drawing-on hooks (9) and, in the case of socks, to the hooks (9a) of the drawing-on station (7) by means of a freely programmable control (38). At the highest point of the drawing-on station (7), the stocking (2) is drawn onto the form (21) via a flap (29) by means of the two synchronously working drawing-on rollers (24), so that the advantage of the machine according to the invention is to be seen in easier work for the operators and in higher efficiency and rapidity.
