<ABSTRACT>
A collection processor which regenerates a recording medium 
on which data can be erasably recorded and which can be repeatedly 

usable. The processor is provided with a main transport path (17) for 
transporting a recording medium (3) fetched from the outside; a recorded 

data reading unit (15) which reads at least the data indicating 
the number of regenerations written in a specific area of the recording 

medium fetched from the outside; a control device (110) which 
determines whether or not the recording medium is to be reused in 

accordance with the number of regenerations thus read, and if not be 
reused, an throw-away instruction is issued, while, if to be reused, the 

number of the regenerations is updated, and data representing the 
number and an instruction to write this number are output; and a separation 

processing unit (16) which separates the recording medium 
instructed to the throw-away instruction of which has been issued 

from the main carrier path; and a number writing unit (19) which receives 
the instruction to write the number of regenerations, and then, 

writes the data representing the number of regenerations of the recording 
medium in the specific area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collection and processing 
apparatus of recording media on which necessary items are 
erasably recorded for transferring information, and in particular 
to a recording medium collection and processing apparatus which 
separates recording media according to whether or not they can 
be used, and processes only usable recording media so as to 
recycle them. In a gaming house containing gaming machines such as 
pinball machines, a player plays games at a gaming machine and 
obtains game play media by winning games. The number of game 
play media won by the player is counted using a game play media 
counter, for example. The game play media counter records the 
count result on paper, such as thermosensible paper, using a 
recording head, and issues a receipt. For recording, digits and a 
bar code indicating the number of game play media are printed on 
paper, for example.  In such a gaming house, the player receives the receipt and 
can exchange the receipt for a prize equivalent to the number of 
game play media indicated on the receipt at an adjustment 
counter or window. The player may exchange the receipt for cash 
if such a transaction is legal. Incidentally, the applicant proposed use of repeatedly 
usable recording media of card type in place of such receipts to 
avoid wasting of resources in Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 
3-272659 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-111570, laid 
open to public on May 7, 1993) and Japanese Patent Application 
No. Hei 3-260879 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-96058, 
laid open to public on April 20, 1993). Since the recording media 
can be recycled, excellent effects of contributing to cost 
reduction, resource conservation, etc., can be expected. However, 
the number of times such a recording medium can be repeatedly 
used is finite; to secure reliability in recording data, the 
recording media need to be discarded within certain limits. To use a large number of such recording media, for example, 
in a gaming house, the recording media may be replaced with new 
ones all together. However, this method requires collection of a 
large number of recording media and replacement of them all with 
new ones, which is labor consuming, and is not an easy method. 
Simultaneous replacement of recording media having different 
usage conditions introduces the following problem: When the 
recording media are considered individually, replacement of those  
 
frequently used is delayed; whereas replacement of those less 
frequently used is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A recording medium collection and processing apparatus 
for recycling recording media which are capable of erasably 

recording data and are repeatedly usable, said apparatus 
comprising: 

   a main transport passage for transporting a recording 
medium taken in from outside; 

   a record data reader for reading at least data indicating the 
number of recycle times of the recording medium taken in from 

the outside, written in a specific area of the recording medium; 
   a controller for determining whether or not the recording 

medium is to be reused based on the read data indicating the 
number of recycle times, if the recording medium is not reused, 

said controller outputting a discarding command and if it is 
reused, said controller updating the number of recycle times and 

outputting data indicating the updated number of recycle times 
and a number-of-times write command; 

   a separation section for separating the recording medium 
for which the discarding command is issued from said main 

transport passage; and 
   a number-of-times writer for writing data indicating the 

number of recycle times of the recording medium into a specific 

area of the recording medium upon receipt of the number-of-recycle-times 
write command. 
The recording medium collection and processing 
apparatus as claimed in claim 1 further including an eraser for 

erasing record data written onto the recording medium to be 
reused. 
The recording medium collection and processing 
apparatus as claimed in claim 2 further including a display for 

displaying contents of record data read by said record data reader. 
The recording medium collection and processing 
apparatus as claimed in claim 3 further including a first stacker 

for storing recycled recording media and a second stacker for 
storing recording media to be discarded. 
The recording medium collection and processing 
apparatus as claimed in claim 4 wherein said controller 

comprises means for counting the number of recycled recording 
media and means for counting the number of recording media to be 

discarded. 
The recording medium collection and processing 
apparatus as claimed in claim 5 further including a display for 

displaying the number of recycled recording media counted by said 
counting means and a display for displaying the number of 

recording media to be discarded, counted by said counting means. 
The recording medium collection and processing 
apparatus as claimed in claim 6 wherein said controller checks 

whether or not the number of recycled recording media reaches a 
capacity of said first stacker and whether or not the number of 

recording media to be discarded reaches a capacity of said second 
stacker, and if either of the numbers reaches the capacity of the 

corresponding stacker, causes said display for displaying the 
contents of record data to display a prestored message requesting 

the recording media to be taken out from said stacker.
