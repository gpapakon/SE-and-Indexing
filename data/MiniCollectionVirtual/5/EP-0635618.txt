<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an elastic sealing profile having a lower sealing foot (2) and an upper sealing head (1) which is connected to said foot via a rear web (3), forms a closed hollow cross-section (II) and exhibits a side web (4) for abutment against a counter-surface to be sealed. In the case of said elastic sealing profile, the side web (4) is connected to the rear web (3) via an upper transverse web (5) and, at the bottom, merges into a connecting web (6) which, at a distance from the rear web (3), opens into a second transverse web (7) projecting therefrom. Said second web runs obliquely downwards from the rear web (3) and, at its end, is supported with respect to the sealing foot (2) via a supporting web (9), the second web forming a closed hollow cross-section (II) with the rear web (3) and the supporting web (9). The connecting web (6) has two web regions (6', 6''), of which the first (6') is fastened at the bottom of the side web (4), is essentially rectilinear and runs approximately parallel to the second transverse web (7). The second web region (6'') is curved, runs non-tangentially from the first web region (6'), and can be laid, essentially over its entire length (L) on the second transverse web (7) if the sealing gap reaches a predetermined gap width.
