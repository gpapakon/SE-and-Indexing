<ABSTRACT>
A winding assembly especially suitable for use in conjunction with a system for 
automated imaging of lithographic plate material, including on-press imaging systems. 

A feeder spool (105) installed within a plate-support cylinder (12) contains a rolled 
supply of plate material, which wraps around the cylinder (12) and is received by an 

uptake spool (110), also located within the cylinder (12). The assembly is driven by 
the same power source used to rotate the plate-support cylinder (12), and maintains a 

strong tension along the wrapped material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to planographic 
printing, and in particular to an apparatus for continuously 
supplying new plate material to the plate cylinder of 
planographic printing press or plate-imaging apparatus. Traditional techniques of introducing a printed image 
onto a recording material include letterpress printing, gravure 
printing and offset lithography. All of these printing methods 
require a plate, usually loaded onto a plate cylinder of a 
rotary press for efficiency, to transfer ink in the pattern of 
the image. In letterpress printing, the image pattern is 
represented on the plate in the form of raised areas that 
accept ink and transfer it onto the recording medium by 
impression. Gravure printing plates, in contrast, contain 
series of wells or indentations that accept ink for deposit 
onto the recording medium; excess ink must be removed from the 
plate by a doctor blade or similar device prior to contact 
between the plate and the recording medium. In the case of offset lithography, the image is present 
on a plate or mat as a pattern of ink-accepting (oleophilic) 
and ink-repellent (oleophobic) surface areas. In a dry 
printing system, the plate is simply inked and the image 
transferred onto a recording medium; the plate first makes 
contact with a compliant intermediate surface called a blanket 
cylinder which, in turn, applies the image to the paper or 
other copying medium. In typical rotary press systems, the  
 
recording medium is attached to an impression cylinder, which 
brings it into contact with the blanket cylinder. In a wet lithographic system, the non-image areas are 
hydrophilic, and the necessary ink-repellency is provided by an 
initial application of a dampening (or "fountain") solution to 
the plate prior to inking. The fountain solution prevents ink 
from adhering to the non-image areas, but does not affect the 
oleophilic character of the image areas. The plates for an offset press are usually produced 
photographically. In a typical negative-working subtractive 
process, the original document is photographed to produce a 
photographic negative. This negative is placed on an aluminum 
plate having a water-receptive oxide surface coated with a 
photopolymer. Upon exposure to light or other radiation 
through the negative, the areas of the coating that received 
radiation (corresponding to the dark or printed areas of the 
original) cure to a durable oleophilic state. The plate is 
then subjected to a developing process that removes the uncured 
a

Apparatus for winding lithographic plate material (13) onto a plate 
cylinder (12) adapted for rotation about a longitudinal axis, the apparatus 

comprising: 

a plate cylinder (12); 
supply means (105), located within the plate cylinder (12), for 
dispensing lithographic plate material (13) in web form; and 
uptake means (110), located within the plate cylinder (12), for
