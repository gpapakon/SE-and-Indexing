<CLAIMS>
A drive apparatus for tightening a vehicle safety belt comprising
a guide tube (7), a piston (2) which is guided in the guide tube and which

is drivable by a gas generator (1) arranged in the piston, a pulling means
(15) which connects the piston to a portion to be driven, and a pressure

chamber which is formed in the guide tube and into which a propellent gas
produced in the interior of the piston by the gas generator issues through

at least one outlet opening in the piston, wherein the gas generator (1)
has a propellant outlet side which is directed into an internal space in

the piston and which is opened by the fired propellant in the gas
generator, and the internal space in the piston is in the form of a

combustion chamber for the propellant issuing from the gas generator,
characterised in that the guide tube (7) is stationarily supported and that

provided at the piston end in the drive direction is a return motion
blocking means (9) which for blocking a piston movement in the opposite

direction to the drive direction can be brought into engagement with the
inside wall of the guide tube (7), to block the piston movement.
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the pressure
chamber (6) is closed off at the end of the guide tube (7) by a closure

element (8) which is in the form of a filter for firing residues.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the return motion blocking means (9) has a blocking element (10) which is

radially expandable relative to the axis of the guide tube (7) and which
is guided on a conical projection portion (11) of the piston (2) in such

a way that the blocking element (10) can be freely guided in the drive
direction against the inside wall of the guide tube (7) and in the case of

a piston movement which is directed in the opposite direction to the drive
direction can be expanded by the conical projection portion (11) for

locking engagement with the inside wall of the guide tube (7).
Apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in that the conical 
projection portion (11) is hollow and includes the at least one outlet

opening (5).
Apparatus according to claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in that
the inside wall of the guide tube (7) has peripherally extending grooves

(12) with which the expanded blocking element (10) can be brought into
engagement.
Apparatus according to one of claims 3 to 5 characterised in that
the blocking element (10) has a pointed edge (13) which comes into

engagement with the inside wall of the guide tube (7) upon expansion of the
ring.
Apparatus according to one of claims 3 to 6 characterised in that
the blocking element (10) is carried in a biased condition on the conical

projection portion (11).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that
the gas generator (1) is so designed that the propellent gas issues in at

least two stages, wherein the gas which issues during the first stage
exerts a drive action on the piston (2) which is reduced relative to the

gas of the subsequent second stage or subsequent stages.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that
the gas generator (1) has an electrical firing device (14).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that
the pulling means (15) is in the form of a tension cable and is fixedly

supported on the piston (2) by way of a cable pressing portion (17) which
is of a larger diameter than the tension cable.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in
that in normal operation the piston (7) is supported against the closure

element (8).
Apparatus according to claim 10 characterised in that the at 
least one outlet opening (5) is provided by an orifice in a support ring

(19) which is formed on the cable pressing portion (17) and which is
fixedly supported against the piston end portion in the interior of the

piston.
Apparatus according to one of claims 3 to 12 characterised in
that the conical projection portion (11) is formed externally on the piston

end portion (18).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in
that at the end of the drive movement of the piston (7) the pulling means

(15) is guided to be further movable on the piston in the drive direction
with a braking effect.
Apparatus according to claim 14 characterised in that provided
between the piston (7) and the cable pressing portion (17) is a brake (16)

which brakes the further movement of the pulling means (15) relative to the
stopped piston (7).
