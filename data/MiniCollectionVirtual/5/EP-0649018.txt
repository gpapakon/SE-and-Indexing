<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for continuous monitoring of the concentration of at least one gaseous component in gas mixtures. A disadvantage with known devices is, however, their complex construction, their high energy demand, their large spatial requirement and, as a result of the large mass, inhomogeneous temperature distribution, with the consequence of measurement inaccuracies, and their inertia, especially in the starting phase. The disadvantages with the prior art are avoided in the device according to the invention in that a support is designed as a lamina, on one side of which at least two electrodes are applied as mutually separated thin films, in that, on one side of the ceramic wafer, a temperature sensor separated from the electrodes is furthermore applied and in that, on the other side of the lamina, an electrical heating resistor film is provided for heating.

Device for the continuous monitoring of the concentration of at least one
gaseous constituent in gas mixtures having


a) at least two electrochemical half cells with an oxygen-ionic conducting
solid electrolyte,
b) a non-ionic conducting ceramic layer on top of the solid electrolyte and
onto which preferably metallic and/or metal-oxide-containing electrodes

interacting with the gaseous constituents are applied in the form of a thin layer
by means of screen printing, wherein an electric measuring signal dependent on

the concentration of the gaseous constituents is produced,
c) a heating device,
d) electric leads to connect and to tap off the electrical measuring signals
and having at least two electrodes in the form of thin layers arranged at a

distance from one another on one side of the device, wherein a temperature
sensor at a distance from the electrodes is further applied on the same side and

has an electrical resistance heating layer provided as a heating device on
another side of the device,

sensor (8) as well as the solid electrolyte (12) in the form of a layer on which the

electrodes (11a, 11b) are applied, wherein the layers of the temperature sensor
(8) and of the solid electrolyte (12) are applied by means of screen printing, and

that the electrical measuring signals appear between the temperature sensor (8)
or the electrical resistance heating device (10) on the one hand and each of the

electrodes (11a, 11b) on the other hand for the measurement of a plurality of
