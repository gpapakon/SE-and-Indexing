<ABSTRACT>
Beading machine comprising an external roll (12) and 
a core-support (13) comprising two internal rolls (28,29), 

the leading edge (56) of the external roll being 
approximately elliptical. 
This machine is thus suitable for forming a 
deep bead on a metal cylindrical element such as a can 

body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to annular beading of a metal 
cylindrical element. In particular the invention relates 
to the annular beading of a can body formed from sheet 
metal, more particularly from a sheet of double 
reduced thin steel. The invention also concerns a beading machine for 
forming such a metal cylinder. Patent Application FR 88 15 548 describes a process 
for forming an internal annular flange in a can body. 
This annular flange, situtated slightly axially spaced 
from the open end of the can body, allows a flexible cover 
hermetically closing the opening to be sealed, until the 
first removal of the product contained in the can. This 
annular flange is the result of two operations. First of 
all one makes an annular beading, at a slight axial 
distance from the opening and one then carries out an 
appropriate flattening of this bead. The bead has to be 
relatively deep in order subsequently to give rise to an 
annular flange sufficient for the heat-sealing of the 
cover. This can pose problems with certain metals or 
alloys, such as in particular the "double reduced" steel, 
used more and more, with which one makes metal cans of 
low thickness and high mechanical strength. The invention in particular allows these objectives 
to be attained and these problems to be solved. According to a first embodiment of the invention, 
there is provided a machine for annular beading of a metal 
cylindrical element such as for example a can body, the 
machine comprising an external roll, characterised in that 
the machine further comprises a core-support comprising 
two internal rolls designed to hold the cylindrical 
element and to support it on both sides of a beading zone, 
the external roll and the core-holder having parallel 
respective axes of rotation and one of them being 
displaceable in the direction of the other in order to 
make the beading, and in that the leading edge of the  
 
external roll has a profile approximately elliptical in 
section in a plane containing its axis of rotation. Thus, the beading machine as defined above, although 
suitable for all types of beading, can be used 
advantagously for carrying out the first stage, as 
described above, of the formation of an internal annular 
flange in a can body of a metal container with a flexible 
cover, especially where this can body is made from a thin 
sheet of "double reduced" steel. Preferably, the edges of the internal rolls situated 
in the vicinity of the beading zone are rounded. Advantageously, at least one of these edges has

Machine for annular beading of a metal cylindrical 
(15), the machine comprising an external roll (12), 

characterised in that: 
   the machine further comprises a core-support (13) 

comprising two internal rolls (28, 29) adapted to hold the 
cylindrical element and to support the cylindrical element 

on both sides of a beading zone (30); 
   in which the external roll (12) and the core-support 

(13) have parallel axes of rotation, one of the roll (12) 
and the core-support (13) being displacable towards the 

other in order to form the beading; 
   and characterised in that the leading edge (56) of 

the external roll (12) has a profile approximately 
elliptical in section in a plane containing its axis of 

rotation. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the core-support (13) comprises two coaxial parts (25, 26) 

respectively carrying the internal rolls and at least one 
of which is mounted so as to be axially displaceable and 

is elastically urged towards the other coaxial part and in 
that the edges (28b, 29b) of the internal rolls (28, 29) 

situated in the vicinity of the beading zone (30) are 
rounded. 
Machine according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
at least one of the edges (28b, 29b) has a profile 

approximately elliptical in section in a plane containing 
the axis of rotation of the corresponding internal roll. 
Machine according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the edges (28b, 29b) of the internal rolls situated in the 

beading zone (30) each have an approximately elliptical 
profile. 
Machine according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the two edges have the same approximately elliptical 

profile. 
Machine according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
the approximately elliptical profile of the two edges 

(28b, 29b) is the same as that of the external roll (12). 
Machine according to any one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that the median plane (Po) of the 

external roll (12) passing through the leading edge (56) 
is offset axially, in the disengaged beading position, in 

relation to the plane of the front face (28a) of a first 
internal roll (28). 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the first internal roll (28) is 

mounted so as to be axially displaceable and is biassed by 
a spring (39) towards the second internal roll (29) and in 

that the axial position in the absence of beading is 
stabilised by stopping means (40). 
Machine according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the second internal roll (29) is biassed by a spring (46) 

towards the first internal roll and in that the machine 
further comprises stopping means (50) adapted to enter 

into contact with a circular edge of the cylindrical 
element (15) in order to determine the position of the 

roll (29) on the cylindrical element.
