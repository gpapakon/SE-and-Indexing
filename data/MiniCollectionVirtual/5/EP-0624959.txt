<ABSTRACT>
Receiver intended for receiving a predetermined FM signal in which a message signal A(t) modulates the frequency of a carrier, including a local oscillator (23), a heterodyne stage (24) and a demodulator stage (33). The heterodyne stage comprises a signal generator (25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32) for generating n signals a1...an, each signal comprising the message signal modulated at the said intermediate frequency. These signals have the following relationship with each other

 n being a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and i possibly taking any value of positive integers less than or equal to n. The heterodyne stage also includes a multiplier (28) multiplying the n signals together so as to produce an output signal of the heterodyne stage in which the message signal is modulated at a frequency equal to n times the intermediate frequency. Layout making it possible to stretch the possible bandwidth of the message signal without increasing the intermediate frequency.
