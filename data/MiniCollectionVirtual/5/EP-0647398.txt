<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organ 
storage solution or perfusate to be used when an organ is 
extirpated. The drastic improvement of performance record 
of organ transplantation is attributable to the progress 
of organ storage solution or perfusate as well as the 
progress of surgical operations and the advancement of 
antibiotics and immunosuppressants. In organ transplantation, perfusion of the 
transplanted organ is essential, but when perfusing the 
organ which is in an ischemic state, ischemic perfusion 
trouble is unavoidable. Thus, minimization of the 
cellular trouble caused in the process of perfusion is a 
key factor for the success of organ transplantation. Hitherto, UW solution (JP-A-1-246201; a 
solution composed of potassium lactobionate, potassium 
dihydrogenphosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium 
hydroxide, raffinose, adenosine, glutathione, insulin, 
bactrim, dexamethasone, allopurinol and hydroxyl ethyl 
starch) has been used the storage solution, and Ringer's 
solution or Carolina Rinse solution (a solution composed 
of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium 
chloride, sodium lactate, adenosine, allopurinol, 
desferrioxamine and glutathione) has been used as the  
 
perfusate. Further, the modified versions of these 
solutions featuring incorporation of proteinase inhibitors 
such as nafamostat mesilate in the compositions have been 
reported: Shinryo to Shinyaku (Clinic and New Drugs), 
Vol. 29, No. 1, p194-197, (1992). Of these organ storage solutions and perfusates, UW 
solution was developed by Belzer et al in 1987 and has 
phenomenally prolonged the organ preservable period. 
However, since this solution contains hydroxyl ethyl starch 
as noted from its composition, the solution is increased in 
viscosity in use, making it difficult to remove blood from 
the organ. Also, because of high potassium concentration, 
this solution gives detrimental effect to the vascular 
endothelium. This solution is also unsatisfactory in its 
buffering action. Further, it is costly as it contains 
insulin. The organ preservable period of Ringer's solution or 
Carolina Rinse solution is 24 hours at most. This is 
rather unsatisfactory for a storage solution. The object of the present invention is to provide an 
organ storage solution or perfusate at a low cost which is 
designed to safely preserve the organ to be transplanted or 
to protect the organ from cellular trouble caused in the 
process of perfusion. The present inventors have tried to incorporate 
electrolyte, osmotic pressure
