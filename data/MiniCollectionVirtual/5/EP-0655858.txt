<ABSTRACT>
A method for gray scale printing combining row integration and pulse 
width modulation. A spatial light modulator (102) has one line (104) 

designated to perform PWM within a given line time. Another area of the 
modulator (106) has lines designated to perform row integration on the print 

image, allowing for more gray levels. An additional area (108) can be 
designated to correct for defects in the illumination profile and the printed 

images.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to gray scale imaging.Achieving gray scale with a spatial light modulator presents several
difficulties. One occurs when using binary SLMs, whose elements can only be
either ON or OFF. In printing systems, that means either the photosensitive
media either receives light from that element or not. If it does not receive
light, the drum does not pick up any toner, and the resulting page remains
blank (white) at that spot. If the photosensitive media does receive light, the
drum picks up toner and the resulting page becomes black at that spot. In
most binary SLMs, there exists no way to expose a photosensitive media so as
to pick up a lesser amount of toner in an analog-fashion.Laser printing systems can achieve gray scale by modulating the light
in an analog fashion, typically using the power of the laser. However, laser
systems cannot normally modulate in this analog fashion fast enough to
achieve more than a minimum number of gray levels. Laser scanning
systems print pixel-by-pixel by scanning the laser beam along raster lines.
For example, the user wants to print an 8.5" by 11" paper with 600 dots per
inch (dpi) at 40 pages per minute. Each page requires 11" x 600 dpi, or 660
lines. At 40 pages per minute this equals 4400 lines per second, where each
line has 8.5 x 600, or 5100 pixels. This requires 22.44 x 106 pixels per
second, allowing 44.6 nanoseconds per pixel. Lasers cannot modulate fast
enough in an analog fashion to give gray-scale exposure during the short
pixel time. Some SLMs have this capability.US-A-4 750 010 discloses a circuit for generating a set of
center pulse-width modulated waveforms comprising a counter
having a time changing count, and comparators which compare
the count with respective preset counts. The preset counts
to the comparators are set so that the set of waveforms
created is center pulse-width modulated.EP-A-0 467 048 discloses an arrangement for field updating a
deformable mirror device array. A bistable deformable mirror
device circuitry used in a high-definition television
application must be capable of supporting at least 128 gray
levels, using pulse-width modulation. If the deformable
mirror device is line-updated, then the minimum field time
to support 128 gray level cannot be achieved because of the
time required to perform a resonant reset once each line. In
the field-update technique the deformable mirror device is
operated in a mode where the beams are electronically latched
to their old landing angles and cannot respond to the

<CLAIMS>
A method of gray scale imaging comprising the steps of:

performing pulse width modulation within rows of a
first region of a spatial light modulator; and
performing row integration within at least one of a
second region of a spatial light modulator not including

said first region, such that row integration determines the
integer part of a gray level, and said pulse width

modulation determines the fractional part of said gray level
for an image.

performing corrections to said image in a third region of

said modulator, said third region being other than said first

width modulation is symmetric pulse width modulation.
A method of pulse width modulation for gray scale imaging
