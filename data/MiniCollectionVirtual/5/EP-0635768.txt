<ABSTRACT>
An image-forming device with a repeatedly usable image-recording element 
bearing a dielectric surface layer (7) and beneath it a system of each separately 

energisable image-forming electrodes (5). Directly beneath the dielectric surface layer 
the image-forming electrodes (5) are interconnected by a material whose resistance is 

between that of the dielectric surface layer and that of the image-forming electrodes and 
is preferably a factor of 10²-10⁴ lower than that of the dielectric surface layer. 

Preferably, the dielectric surface layer and the material having the lower resistance are 
formed as one continuous layer (7) which in the bottom part has a lower resistance than 

in the top part. Preferably, this layer consists of silicon oxide SiO
x
, where x in the bottom 
part of the layer is on average about 0.4-0.65 and in the top part of the layer on average 

about 1.2-1.6.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image-forming device having a movable 
image-recording element comprising a support with a dielectric surface layer beneath 
which there is disposed a system of separately energisable image-forming electrodes, 
an image-forming zone situated along the path of movement of the image-recording 
element, in which zone a counter electrode is disposed a short distance above the 
dielectric surface of the image-recording element, energisation means for applying a 
voltage between the image-forming electrodes and the counter electrode in accordance 
with an image pattern to be recorded, in order that toner powder supplied in the 
image-forming zone may be deposited on the surface of the image-recording element in 
accordance with the image pattern. 
The invention also relates to an image-recording element for use in such an 
image-forming device. 
Image-forming devices and image-recording elements usable therein as referred to 
above are described, inter alia, in European patents 0 191 521, 0 247 694 and 0 247 699. 
In these known devices, a toner powder image recorded on the image-recording 
element in the image-forming zone is transferred directly or indirectly via an 
intermediate to a receiving material, such as ordinary paper, and fixed thereon. The 
image-recording element is then used again for a subsequent image-recording cycle. 
With this type of image-forming devices, of course, the longest possible life is required 
for the image-recording element. One problem which arises is that the repeated 
mechanical, electrical and thermal loading to which the image-recording element is 
subjected causes one or more fractures to occur in the image-forming electrode or 
electrodes themselves or in the connection between the image-forming electrode or 
electrodes and the electric energising means, so that the electrode "floats" and is no 
longer energised. A floating image-forming electrode provides no further contribution 
to the image-forming, and this becomes visible on the print in the form of a fine 
tonerfree streak in the image pattern. In addition, it is regularly observed that toner is 
deposited in the imagefree portions, so that a fine toner streak is formed on the print in 
those portions. One floating image-forming electrode, therefore, already makes it 
desirable to replace the image-recording element. The invention provides an improved image-forming device of the kind referred to in 
the preamble, having an improved image-recording element so that the above adverse
