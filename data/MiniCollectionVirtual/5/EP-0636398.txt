<ABSTRACT>
The unit comprises an alcoholometer-carrier (1) whose downward conduit (4) opens to the atmosphere at its top through a lid (32) which can be opened to give access to a removable filter (29, 30); a valve (23) made so as to prevent, when it is in a stop position, the distillate from entering the alcoholometer-carrier (1); and locking means (33, 34, 35) intended to lock the lid (32) in a closed position while the valve (23) is not in a stop position, and vice versa.

A spirits distillation installation equipped with an
alcoholmeter carrier (1) comprising a horizontal distillate entry

pipe (3), which opens into a descending vertical pipe (4) the
base of which is connected to at least one alcoholmeter reception

unit (5) and the top of which is open to the atmosphere through
a vent adapted to prevent access to its interior, characterized

in that:

the said vent (31) is carried by a cover (32) which can
be opened to gain access to a removable filter (29, 30) located

inside the descending pipe (4);
it is equipped at the upstream end of the said entry pipe
(3) with a valve (23, 24; 50) adapted to prevent, when it

is in a stop position, the distillate being able to enter the
alcoholmeter carrier; and
it is also equipped with blocking means (33, 34, 35; 33
34', 51-54) for blocking the said cover (32) in a closed position

as long as the said valve (23, 24; 50) is not in the stop
position and to block the said valve in the stop position when

the cover is not in the closed position.
An installation according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the said blocking means comprise :


an adjustment element (34, 34');
means (35; 53, 54) for connecting in movement the
adjustment element (34, 34') and the obturator of the valve (23,

24 ; 50);
means (35; 51, 52) for mounting the adjustment element
adapted to allow it to move only along a predetermined path along

all of which it remains fixed to the rest of the installation,
the said path including one end corresponding to the stop

position of the valve and being intersected near this end by the
cover when the latter is not in the closed position, and
means (33) for mounting the cover (32) adapted to allow
it to move only along a predetermined path along all of which it 

remains fixed to the rest of the installation, the said path
including one end corresponding to the closed position, and being

intersected near this end by the adjustment element when the
latter is not in the stop position.
An installation according to either one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that:


the cover (32) is mounted articulated around a horizontal
pivotment axis, with a path terminated at the bottom by the

closed position, and it has a flat upper surface which is
horizontal in the closed position; and
it is provided with an adjustment element (34; 34')
mounted articulated around a vertical pivotment axis, connected

in movement with the obturator of the said valve (23, 24;
50), and having a flat horizontal lower surface, which is located

at a level corresponding to that of the upper face of the cover
(32) when the latter is closed, the cover being overlapped by at

least a portion of the adjustment element (34; 34') in all
positions of the valve other than the stop position, in

which the cover is at least partially located at right angles to
the adjustment element, just in front of the latter, while it is

not closed.
An installation according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the adjustment element (34) is mounted articulated by fixing it

to the obturator of the said valve (23) which rotates
around a vertical pivotment axis.
An installation according to Claim 4, characterized in that
the cover (32) is mounted articulated by means of a hinge (33)

disposed transversely above the entry pipe (3).
An installation according to Claim 5, characterized in that:

the cover (32) comprises two opposite longitudinal edges
(36) and a transverse edge (37) the ends of which each join the

end of one of the longitudinal edges (36) which is situated 
towards the entry pipe (3), the said hinge (33) being fixed to

the cover by the said transverse edge (37);
the adjustment element (34) comprises a front face (40)
which, when the valve is in the stop position and the cover

is closed, fits closely against one of the longitudinal edges
(36) of the cover.
An installation according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the adjustment element (34) comprises a face shaped like a

portion of a circle, centred on its pivotment axis, and having
a diameter corresponding to the distance between the said axis

and the end of the cover opposite to the transverse edge (37).
An installation according to Claim 7, characterized in that:

the cover (32) comprises, opposite the said transverse
edge (37), a rounded edge (38) the ends of which each join the

end of one of the longitudinal edges (36), and
the adjustment element (34) has a front face (40) which,
when the valve is in the stop position and the cover is

closed, also fits closely against a predetermined portion of the
said rounded edge (38) and then joins the said face (39) which

is a portion of a circle.
An installation according to Claim 8, characterized in that
a hook (41) fixed to the descending pipe (4) is provided opposite

the said hinge (33) with a lug just overlapping the adjustment
element (34) when the valve is not in the stop position.
An installation according to any one of Claims 2 to 9,
characterized in that:


the cover (32) is formed from a plate in which ventilation
holes (31) are made in the region corresponding to where a filter

cloth is fitted internally, and
the adjustment element (34, 34') is formed from a plate
and it comprises a central aperture to allow the said ventilation

holes to be open to the atmosphere when the alcoholmeter carrier
is supplied with distillate.
