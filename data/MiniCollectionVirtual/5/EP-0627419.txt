has been made on the synthesis of an optically active
form of the compound of the formula (II).The present inventors conducted extensive
research on processes for preparing the optically active
form of the compound of the formula (II) and found that a
1-phenylpyrrolidone derivative having optical activity
and represented by the formula (I) which is a novel
compound undisclosed in literature is useful as an
intermediate for preparing the optically active form of
the compound of the formula (II). The present inventors
completed this invention on the basis of this finding.The present invention provides a 1-phenylpyrrolidone
derivative having optical activity and
represented by the formula (I)

as defined in Claim 1 The present discloses also describes a 1-phenylpyrrolidone
derivative represented by the formula
(I-a)

which is an intermediate for preparing the 1-phenylpyrrolidone
derivative of the formula (I) having
optical activity.The present invention further provides a
process for preparing the foregoing 1-phenylpyrrolidone
derivative having optical activity and represented by the
formula (I), characterized in that the process comprises
the steps of:
i) reacting the foregoing compound of the formula (I-a)
with a chlorinating agent in a solvent which does not
participate in the reaction to convert the compound to
the acid chloride thereof,ii) reacting the acid chloride prepared in the step i)
with an optionally substituted optically active α-phenylethylamine
(formula IV described herein after)
in the presence of a basic compound in a 
solvent which does not participate in the reaction to
give a mixture of diastereomers of a compound represented
by the formula (I)

wherein R is as
