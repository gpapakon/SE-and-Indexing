The device for implementing the process of the invention consists of a hollow body (1) with an inlet aperture (7) and an outlet aperture (8), in which a powdered first silica-gel-based material (10) is inserted into the hollow body (1) between two securing devices (5 and 6) and a second material (11) is arranged between the first material (10) and the outlet aperture, whereby the first and second materials (10, 11) have different adsorption characteristics for nucleic acids.
