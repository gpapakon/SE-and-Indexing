<ABSTRACT>
Underpants (1) with menses excretion absorbing element as 
an integral part (2), which do not inflate the woman's 

figure (9) which is reflected through the clothing as 
diapers do.

 
These underpants do not have the disadvantage of causing 

poisoning as tampons do. These underpants do not move out 
of place or fold in the pudenda, nor do they stick its hair 

with moist adhesiv and enable menses flowing and staining 
the clothing as hygienic pads do. These underpants prevent 

menses from staining the clothing in any pose, also when 
menses flowing backwards while lying on the back.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to menses excretion
absorbent means.All means existing today to absorb menses excretion
suffer disadvantages.Therefore there is an importance and great use for women
in a new and ideal invention to absorb menses excretion that
is free of the disadvantages.The existing means and their disadvantages are:
A. Tampons: Cause a feeling of inconvenience, dryness and
irritation in the vagina. There are some which are
dangerous, that during heavy absorption, their fibers
penetrate the blood system through cuts in the vagina, and
cause poisoning and death.B. Cotton wool, or hygienic pads: Cause a feeling of
inconvenience, lack of freedom, dryness irritation and
rubefaction in the pudenda and between the legs. It is
necessary to attach them to the pudenda lips which will hold
them. When a woman is moving, they move out of place, and
there is a possibility of staining the clothes.C. Hygienic pads with adhesive strips to the underpants: It
is necessary to peel the protective cover off the moist
adhesive, to direct and stick the pad right to its place in
the underpants. This act is inconvenient and a nuisance. In
order to make it work, it is preferred to remove and stretch
the underpants. This is hard to perform in public toilets,
and especially when the underpants are moist from sweat. The
adhesion does not hold together in all situations and the pad
moves (for instance while walking or dancing and heavy
perspiration). With a pad with a better adhesion, it often
happens that only part of the adhesion deteriorates, and then
the pad folds in the pudenda and the menses flow to the
underpants. And if the pad also turns over when it folds, the
pudenda hair sticks and entangles with the moist adhesive 
that's in it. It also happens that the upper part of the pad
sticks to the menses, the lower part is attached to the
underpants and then the pad deteriorates and falls apart by
the friction produced by walking or movement. When lying on
the back, the menses flow backwards, passing the rectum and
staining the underpants. Even a pad with an adhesive gives a
feeling of lack of freedom and clothes staining is possible.
During heavy excretion the menses accumulate at the side of
the pad attached to the leg openings in the underpants and
the menses flow to the clothing. Even if there was a pad
with an excellent adhesion which guarantees no movement, then
since the pad is not an integral part of the underpants, it
is another layer between the underpants and the pudenda.
While walking, dancing, etc.,

<CLAIMS>
Underpants for use by women during a menstrual period,
comprising an undergarment (1) having openings for a wearer's

loins and legs respectively, 
characterised in that
 as an
integral part of the undergarment, there is provided:


an outer layer made of a smooth menses sealing material
(1), which is pleasant to the touch, in the shape of

underpants tailored to conform to one of a plurality of
selected body sizes and figure models,
an inner layer made of a smooth menses permeable
material which does not stick to menses and which is pleasant

to the touch, in the same shape as said outer layer, and
a menses absorbing element (2) coupled between said
outer and inner layers, said menses absorbing element having

relatively high capacity for absorbing and retaining menses
with relatively minimal expansion in thickness,

   said menses absorbing element (2) extending at
least within the crotch area and lengthwise from the top of

the pudendal area of the wearer along the inside of the leg
openings to the upper rear edge (4) of the underpants in a

thin, flat, not bulky manner,

   wherein the edges of said menses absorbing element
are formed in a graded, sloping shape so as to form a

continuous connection with no sharp boundary with said outer
and inner layers, so that the underpants smoothly fit the

body of the wearer and do not inflate the figure reflected
through tight clothes;

and wherein each of the loins and legs openings,
together with the edges of the layers and the element along

each opening, are elasticated, so as to prevent leakage of
menses through the opening.
Underpants for use by women as claimed in Claims 1,

characterised in
that
 as an integral part of the undergarment (1), there is
provided a thin menses absorbing element (2) comprising


one or more layers of materials having high capacity for
absorbing and retaining menses with minimal expansion in

thickness, so as not to inflate the figure of the wearer as
seen through tight clothes,
the menses absorbing element (2) being positioned within
the crotch area of the undergarment (1) and extending

lengthwise at least from the pudendal area of the wearer to
the upper rear edge (4) of the undergarment, and being

contoured to smoothly fit the body of the wearer, and
a menses permeable layer, which does not stick to
menses, as the inner surface of the undergarment.
Underpants as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
menses absorbing element extends throughout the whole

underpants area and is affixed to each of the elasticated
openings.
Underpants as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the menses
absorbing element includes more than one layer, and the

layers are arranged in a graded form, with the maximal
thickness of the menses absorbing element in the pudenda

area, and gradually reduced towards the margins, so as to
maintain a smooth, continuous fit over the body.
Underpants as claimed in any of the preceding claims and
further comprising elements which enable opening and closing

of the underpants between the wearer's loins and legs to
facilitate wearing and removal of the underpants, the

elements being smoothly integrated in the underpants so as
not to be visible through tight clothes.
Underpants as claimed in any of the preceding claims and
further comprising holes (8) for ventilation.
