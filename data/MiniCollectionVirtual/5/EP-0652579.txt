<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on the object of producing a circuit breaker (switch), which has a contact arrangement which is suitable for arc quenching by means of arc splitter plates, with an arc chamber with arc quenching buckets (baskets) (3), for relatively low powers. The stationary contact parts (1) are formed at their ends as guide rails (2) which project through a cut out (6) in the arc quenching buckets (3).
