<ABSTRACT>
A racket string consists of lengthwise sections having 
different tensile elastic moduli with at least one section of the 

string having a tensile elastic modulus higher than other 
sections. A stringed racket includes at least one string 

constituting the central stringed area of the racket with higher 
tensile elastic modulus, and a peripheral stringed area with 

sections of the string having lower tensile elastic modulus. 
Another stringed racket includes at least one string constituting 

the central stringed area of the racket with lower tensile 
elastic modulus and a peripheral stringed area with sections of 

the string having higher tensile elastic modulus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a string for tennis rackets,
badminton rackets, squash rackets and the like, and stringed
rackets with such strings. More particularly, the invention
relates to a string which has at least one lengthwise section
with a tensile elastic modulus higher than other sections, and
stringed rackets with such strings.One of the most important concerns in manufacturing a
racket is how to enlarge the sweet spot.The stiffness distribution of the racket head (stringed
area) of a racket was observed by measuring the tensile strength
of each section of the strings of the stringed racket. According
to the measurements, the central section of the stringed area is
macroscopically much stiffer than the peripheral sections. This
is thought to be a product of the vertical and horizontal length
of a racket frame.Hitting a ball on the sweet spot provides an effective
elastic rebound of the ball from the racket. However, if a ball
is hit on a non-sweet spot area (off-spot area), vibrations and
shocks are generated by the hit and a forceful ball cannot be
returned.Since increasing the area of a racket head is effective,
the racket head of popular tennis rackets was increased from 
typically 581 cm2 (90 square inches) to the current 710 cm2 (110 square inches). A
tennis racket with a head area as large as 125 square inches is
widely used by beginners and the aged. As the area of the racket
head is enlarged, the sweet spot area also increases, so that
difficult, off-center balls can be easily returned. However, the
head area may become too large to play with good control and
quick reaction. Thus, there is a limit to making an effective
racket simply by enlarging the area of the head.A tapered string and a stringed racket with such strings,
whose central stringed area has a larger string diameter than the
peripheral area, are disclosed in Published Unexamined Japanese
Utility Models Sho No. 52-16848 and Sho No. 52-16849 by the
inventors of this invention.According to US-A-4,015,133 it has been proposed
to irradiate polyamide strings for rackets and musical
instruments to increase their elasticity and lower their
damping.Professional tennis players who usually hit the ball on
the sweet spot have been requesting a sweet spot with a more
effective elastic rebound. However, in conventional
technologies, it is too costly to manufacture a string which can
form such a sweet spot, thus the string is not practical to
manufacture. In order to solve the problems of conventional strings
and stringed rackets with such
