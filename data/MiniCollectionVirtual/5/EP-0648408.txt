<ABSTRACT>
A haymaking machine (M), especially a rotary windrower, for front mounting has a machine mounting, on which a running-wheel chassis and at least one implement rotor (1) drivable in rotation are provided. A supporting frame (G) guiding the machine is pivotable upwards out of a lowered working position by means of a pull element (Z) about a transverse axis (9) parallel to the ground on a three-point front retention (F) of a tractor (S). There is provided between the free end of the supporting frame (G) and the machine at least one machine axis (8) which is parallel to the transverse axis and about which the machine is pivotable to a limited extent relative to the supporting frame. The machine (M) can be adjusted upwards about the machine axis (8) relative to the supporting frame (G) forwards in the direction of travel, specifically by means of a positive forced-pivoting mechanism (B) actuable between the supporting frame (G) and the machine (M) by means of the pull element (Z).
