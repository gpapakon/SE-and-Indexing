<ABSTRACT>
A display system for displaying occurrence of events in a game machine island (10) having at least one row of game machines, 
in which a plurality of game machines (1) are disposed side by side. There are provided a display system (200) for performing 

the display in a display area provided along the row of the game machines in the game machine island (10) and a display 
control device (300) for controlling the operation of this display system. With a position corresponding to a position of a game 

machine, on which an event occurs as a reference, a plurality of display units are divided into two groups, one including those on 
the left side and the other including those on the right side when one faces the game machine row. Display is performed in such a 

manner that display units on the left side take on a display mode showing a direction from the left end toward the above-described 
reference position and display units on the right side take on a display mode showing a direction from the right end toward 

the above-described position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a display system for making an 
effective appeal with respect to a game machine where trouble or 
the like occurs or in the event of a winning condition of a game 
machine where a player wins game plays at a game machine 
island (dome) having a plurality of game machines such as slot 
machines. In a game house having a number of game machines such as 
slot machines, problems may occur at the machines, or a player 
may perform an illegal or cheating act. If a player meets a given 
condition while playing at a game machine, game play media such 
as medals are paid out to the player for the winning game plays 
from the game machine. If the player wins game plays 
repeatedly at the game machine, the game machine may be locked 
onto a win, namely, placed in a closed condition. In such a case, 
the player needs to call personnel in the game house so that they 
can take appropriate action.  When the need to call personnel occurred, hitherto, the 
player pressed a call switch, or the game machine automatically 
caused a call lamp or buzzer installed on the game machine to 
blink or beep to inform only personnel near to the game machine 
unit. Thus, the related art was not satisfactory to give personnel 
in the game house immediate and obvious information about the 
game machine where problems or the like occurred. This is 
because it is next to impossible for personnel to observe a large 
number of game machines at any one time or because personnel 
do not always exist at a position near the game machine to such a 
degree that they can recognize the produced indication or alarm 
for the game machine promptly. In a game house, when a player wins a game play at a game 
machine such as a slot machine, the game machine uses display 
means installed on the game machine to make representation such 
as displaying graphics representing the winning game play, 
blinking flash lamps, and producing sound through a loudspeaker 
celebrating the winning game play, applauding the player, and 
congratulating the player on his or her luck. In such a case, the successful player would want to feel a 
sense of his or her own superiority over other players. On the 
other hand, unsuccessful players raise the sense of expectation of 
their own success from the success of another person. The players 
in such a mental state will be intent on playing games; this effect  
 
is favorable to game house managers for effective use of game 
machines. However, the conventional appeal for winning game plays 
has been
