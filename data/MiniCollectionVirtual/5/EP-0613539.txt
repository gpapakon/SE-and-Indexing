<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held support for a sighting means comprising a mounting means (2), a pair of handles (4) which extend in a downwards direction from the mounting means (2) and a restraining means (12) which extends rearwardly from the mounting means (2) and which is adapted in use to extend about the upper part of a user's body. The sighting means (6) is rigidly mounted on the mounting means (2). To use the support, a user lifts the handles (4) forwards and upwards, the restraining means (12) restrains the mounting means (2) from forward motion and the support pivots about the point of contact between the restraining means (12) and the user to urge an eyepiece (10) of the sighting means (6) against the user's eye. In a preferred embodiment there are articulations (14) between the mounting means (2) and the restraining means (12) such that the support also pivots about an axis passing through the articulations (14) to urge the eyepiece (10) against a user's eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Hand-Held Support for a Sighting MeansThis invention relates to a hand-held support for a sighting means and in particular for a sighting means which forms part of an optical apparatus or which is alligned with an optical apparatus additionally supported on the hand-held support.Hand-held supports for optical apparatuses which include a sighting means are known which aim to reduce the level of fatigue felt by the user of the apparatus when the user holds the apparatus at eye level for long periods of time. One such support is described in UK Patent No 2,173.016 and comprises mounting means on which the optical apparatus is supported, two arms that extend downwards from the mounting means each arm having a handle at the end of the arm distant from the mounting means and a neck strap the ends of which are connected to respective handles. In use a user holds the handles at waist level and the entire weight of the apparatus is taken by the neck strap. Such supports also aim to improve the steadiness with which the optical apparatus can be held at eye level.Although such supports do improve the steadiness to some extent, they are not generally steady enough to replace a tripod in situations where it is necessary to focus the optical apparatus accurately on a single spot for a relatively long period of time, for example, when a long exposure time is required to take a photograph. Also they are generally not ideally suited to situations where it is desirable to pan the optical apparatus accurately across a field of view in order to keep a moving object at the same position within its sights.The present invention seeks to overcome at least some of the aforementioned disadvantages by providing a hand-held support for a sighting means that can be successfully used to hold a sighting means at eye level for a long period of time with increased steadiness. 

 According to the present invention there is provided a hand-held support for a sighting means with an eyepiece, comprising a mounting means upon which the sighting means is rigidly supported, a p'air of handles which extend from the mounting means in a predominantly downwards direction, restraining means extending rearwardly from the mounting means and adapted in use to extend around the upper part of a user's body to restrain the mounting means against forward motion in such a manner that when forwards and upwards pressure is applied to the handles by the user's hands to lift the sighting means to eye level the support pivots about the point or region of

CLAIMS
1. A hand-held support for a sighting means with an eyepiece, comprising a mounting means upon which the sighting means is rigidly supported, a pair of handles which extend from the mounting means in a predominantly downwards direction, restraining means extending rearwardly from the mounting means and adapted in use to extend around the upper part of a user's body to restrain the support against forward motion in such a manner that when forwards and upwards pressure is applied to the handles by the user's hands to lift the sighting means to eye level the support pivots about the point or region of contact between the user and the
*
 restraining means to urge the eyepiece against the user's eye.
2. A hand-held support according to claim 1 wherein there are one or more articulations between the restaining means and the mounting means arranged so that when forward and upward pressure is applied to the handles by the user's hands to lift the sighting means to eye level the mounting means pivots about the one or more articulations as well as the point or region of contact between the user and the restraining means to urge the eyepiece against the user's eye.
3- A hand-held support according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the restraining means comprises a flexible neck strap.
4. A hand-held support according to claim 2 and claim 3 wherein the articulations are formed by the attachment of the two ends of the neck strap to the mounting means.
5. A hand-held support according to claims 3 or claim 4 wherein the neck strap is adjustable in length.
6. A hand-held support according to any of the preceding claims wherein the sighting means is operated by controls located on at least one of the handles. 


 7.. A hand-held support according to any of the preceding claims wherein the sighting means is part of an optical apparatus -and the optical apparatus is mounted on the mounting means.
8. A hand-held support according to any of claims 1 to 6 wherein an optical apparatus is additionally mounted on the mounting means and the optical axes of the sighting means and the optical apparatus are substantially alligned.
9. A hand-held device according to claim 7 or claim 8 wherein the optical apparatus is operated by controls located on at least one of the handles.
10. A hand-held support according to any one of the preceeding claims wherein the eyepiece has a surround which is resilient in the direction of the line of sight.
11. A hand-held support according to claim 10 wherein the surround is made from a cylinder of an elastically deformable material configured as a concertina.
12. A hand-held support according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the optical apparatus is a camera.
