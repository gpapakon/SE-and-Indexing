<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
photosensitive drum usable in a process cartridge for image formation in an
image forming apparatus, a process cartridge
detachably mountable relative to an image forming
apparatus and including the photosensitive drum, and
an electrophotographic image forming apparatus.The image forming apparatus may be in the
form of a laser beam printer, a LED printer, an
electrophotographic copying machine, a facsimile
machine, a wordprocessor or the like.In a transfer type electrophotographic
copying machine or electrophotographic printer as
examples of conventional image forming apparatus, a
toner image is formed on a photosensitive drum through
known processes including charging, image exposure,
development or the like on the photosensitive drum,
and the image is transferred onto a recording material
such as transfer sheet, and thereafter, residual toner
remaining on the photosensitive drum is removed by a
cleaner.In such an image forming apparatus, a
photosensitive drum and at least one of a charger, a
developing device, a cleaner or other process means 
are unified for the purpose of downsizing and easy
maintenance, and the unit is made detachably mountable
relative to the image forming apparatus (process
cartridge). This is disclosed for example, in U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,985,436, 4,500,195, 4,540,268 and
4,627,701. In U.S. Patent No. 4,829,335 having been
assigned to the applicant hereof the application has
proposed that a helical gear is mounted to a
longitudinal end of the photosensitive member.
According this proposal, when the driving through the
helical gear is effected, thrust force is produced,
and the force is usable for correct positioning of the
photosensitive member in the thrust direction, and
therefore, the proposal is practically significantly
effective.U.S. Patent No. 5,126,800 which has been
assigned to the applicant hereof proposes
that an image bearing member is provided with first
and second drive transmitting portions according to
this invention, by a selective engagement between the
first and second transmitting portions and a third
drive transmitting portion of a developer carrying
member, a rotational speed of the developer carrying
member is selectively changeable despite the common
image bearing member is used. For this reason, this
invention is practically effective. U.S. Patent No. 
5,126,800 provides a process cartridge which is
detachably mountable to a main assembly of an image
forming apparatus, the cartridge comprising: a
photosensitive drum
