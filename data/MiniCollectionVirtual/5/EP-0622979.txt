<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to an electron accelerator which is employed 
for sterilizing packaging material and which is included as a part of an 

aseptic packaging machine which is initially sterilized by means of an 
oxidizing chemical sterilizing agent such as H₂O₂ and steam. The "window" 

(20) of the electron accelerator, which is covered by a metallic window foil 
(19), displays a thin coting of glass disposed on the window foil (19) which 

protects the window foil (19) against chemical action, principally oxidation 
which the chemical sterilizing agent H₂O₂ can give rise to.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron accelerator comprising a 
vacuum chamber including a cathode and an outlet aperture, a so-called 
window, 
means to generate electrons, an anode to accelerate the electrons and a 
composite foil through which the accelerated electrons depart from the 
electron accelerator and which covers the outlet aperture, wherein the 
composite foil comprises a metal layer. 
The invention further relates to a packaging 
machine for aseptic packaging of sterile contents, comprising such electron accelerator. It has long been known in the art to sterilize, for example packages 
and packaging material webs with the aid of accelerated, energy-enriched 
electrons by means of which the webs or the packages are bombarded. The 
electron beam requisite for the sterilization is generated by means of a so-called 
electron accelerator which basically consists of a closed vacuum 
chamber which houses a cathode. From the cathode, electrons can be 
emitted in different ways and these are accelerated towards an anode 
which has high electric potential difference as compared with the cathode. 
The generated electrons accelerated towards the anode depart from the 
electron accelerator through a so-called window which in general consists 
of a thin metal foil and is aimed at the object intended for sterilization. Such 
a sterilization with the aid of energy-enriched electrons has proved to be 
highly efficient for neutralizing micro-organisms and many drawbacks which 
are associated with chemical sterilization and thermal sterilization are 
avoided in particular to materials which are not resistant to the chemical 
agents and/or to heat. One drawback in the electron accelerators which are employed today 
is that the window foil often breaks, since it is subjected to extreme stresses, 
and replacement of window foil is generally a complicated and time-consuming 
operation, which involves considerable operational disruption 
and costs. The window foil largely consists of an extremely thin aluminium 
foil or titanium foil and the stresses to which it is exposed are, on the one 
hand, the mechanical stress which has its basis in the pressure difference 
between the vacuum chamber and the ambient environment surrounding 
the vacuum chamber, and on the other hand, the fact that the electron 
beam through the foil entails a heating of the foil. Since the thin window foil  
 
makes up a part of the wall of the vacuum chamber, it must mostly be 
supported by some form of grid or mesh in order that
