<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an axisymmetric nozzle with adjustable cross-section intended to equip a turbomachine and including at least one ring of flaps, said ring of flaps including a series of operated flaps (3) and a series of interposed follower flaps (5), each follower flap (5) straddling the internal surfaces of the two adjacent operated flaps (3) and being held on the said operated flaps by fastening means, characterised in that the means for fastening a follower flap (5) include a double pin (6) acting like a spring for holding the said follower flap (5) against the internal surfaces of the two adjacent operated flaps (3), the said pin (6) including, upstream, two end portions (11, 12) articulated respectively to the two adjacent operated flaps (3) and, downstream, a middle portion (15) fixed to the said follower flap (5) by fixing means (17).

Axisymmetric nozzle with adjustable cross-section 
intended to equip a turbine engine, and including at 

least one ring of flaps, the said ring of flaps comprising 
a series of driven flaps (3) and a series of interposed 

follower flaps (5), each follower flap (5) overlapping 
the inner surfaces of the two adjacent driven flaps 

(3) and being retained on the said driven flaps by 
fastening means, characterized in that the means of 

fastening a follower flap (5) include a double pin (6) 
performing the function of a spring for holding the said 

follower flap (5) against the inner surfaces of the two 

adjacent driven flaps (3), the said pin (6) including, 
upstream, two end portions (11, 12) articulated respectively 

onto the two adjacent driven flaps (3) and, 
downstream, a central portion (15) fixed onto the said 

follower flap (5) by fixing means (17). 
Nozzle according to Claim 1, in which the follower 
flaps (5) are lobed. 
Nozzle according to Claim 2, in which the follower 
flap (5) has the shape of a frustoconical sector 

(7) which terminates downstream in a spherical part (8). 
Nozzle according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the end portions (11, 12) of the 

pin (6) are divergent.
