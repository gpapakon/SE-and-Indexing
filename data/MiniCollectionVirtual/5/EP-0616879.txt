<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a hydraulic ram 
operated extruder (10,11,13,14) having an extrusion 

die (12) from which an extrudate is delivered and a 
motor driven cutter (48,49) at the die to sever the 

extrudate repeatedly to produce individual pieces of 
extrudate. A hydraulic fluid circuit comprising a pump 

(16) and control valves (19,22,23) delivers hydraulic 
fluid to the ram of the extruder at a substantially 

constant volume flow-rate and a control device (41) 
responsive to the speed of advance of the ram in the 

extruder controls the motor device (48) of the cutter to 
produce blanks of substantially equal volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydraulic ram operated
extruders for producing pieces of extrudate of
substantially the same size.A particular application of such apparatus is the
production of blanks or "pre-forms" of rubber or
similar elastomeric material for subsequent moulding
in compression moulds. In such processes, it is
preferable for all blanks presented to a given mould
to be of exactly the same volume so as to eliminate or
reduce to a minimum wastage of material, or the
production of rejects in the case where undersized
blanks are supplied. However rubber or rubber-like
compounds have a tendency to "recover", that is shrink
in the longitudinal direction after extruding with the
result that the cross-sectional area may increase by
up to 100% or more when leaving the extrusion die.
This shrinking in length and increase in
cross-sectional area may not be uniform along the
length of the extrudate and thus, when cut into pieces
of equal length, the pieces may be of different volume
due to these variations in cross-sectional areas.U.K. Patent No. 1,141,033, upon which the preamble
of claim 1 is based, was directed to an
improved form of hydraulic ram extruder to overcome
the above difficulties by producing pieces of
extrudate of substantially equal volume, the extruder
having a hydraulic ram the plunger of which was
arranged to apply pressure to the material to be
extruded and valve means were provided for controlling
and maintaining a substantially constant rate at which
the fluid was supplied to the hydraulic ram. The ram
had a die-shape to extrude the material in the form of 
a continuous length of appropriate cross-sectional
shape and cutting means were arranged to sweep across
the outlet of the die at equal time intervals to sever
the extrudate into pieces of equal volume. Although
the extruder had a valve arrangement for metering
hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic ram aimed to provide
fluid at a constant volume flow-rate to ensure that
the ram-extruded material from the die at a constant
volume flow-rate, small inaccuracies in the volume of
the blanks produced still arise.A further relevant reference is EP-B- 0 107 778.It is an object of the present invention to
further improve the accuracy of blank forming in a
hydraulic ram operated extruder.This invention provides a hydraulic ram operated
extruder having an extrusion die from which an
extrudate is delivered, cutter means at the die to
sever the extrudate repeatedly to produce individual
pieces of extrudate, means to deliver hydraulic fluid
to the

A hydraulic ram operated extruder
(10,11,13,14) having an extrusion die (12) from which

an extrudate is delivered, cutter means (48,49) at the
die to sever the extrudate repeatedly to produce

individual pieces of extrudate, means (16) to deliver
hydraulic fluid to the ram of the extruder at a

substantially constant volume flow-rate characterised
by control means (40), responsive to the speed of

advance of the ram, in the extruder for controlling
the speed of the cutter means (48,49) to produce

blanks of substantially equal volume, the control
means (40) including means to determine and store a

control ratio equal to the ratio of the cutter speed
to the ram velocity and means for varying the control

ratio to allow blanks of a predetermined volume to be
produced.
A hydraulic ram operated extruder
(10,11,13,14), as claimed in claim 1, characterised in

that the control means (40) comprise a microprocessor
for controlling the speed of a variable speed cutter

means (48,49) in relation to the speed of the ram to
produce blanks of the requisite volume.
A hydraulic ram operated extruder
(10,11,13,14) as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,

characterised in that the means to determine the speed
of the ram comprise a linear transducer responsive to

movement of the ram.
A hydraulic ram operated extruder
(10,11,13,14) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that a screw extruder is connected to 
the hydraulic ram extruder adjacent to the die thereof

for charging the cylinder of the ram during or between
extrusion operations of the ram.
