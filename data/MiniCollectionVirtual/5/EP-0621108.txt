<ABSTRACT>
A machine for dispensing stackable roofing washers of 
small size (18) or large size (24) individually and for 

driving fasteners (16) through such washers (18, 24) 
includes a shuttle (50) actuatable to displace the lower-most 

washer (18, 24) from a stack. A gate (100) is biased 
towards a lowermost position wherein it provides sufficient 

clearance for the lowermost washer (18, 24) but not any 
overlying washer to pass beneath it. A pawl (110) mounted 

pivotally to the gate (100) is biased to a lowermost 
position wherein the pawl (110) engages a small washer (18, 

Figure 18) displaced by the shuttle (50) so as to restrain 
it against backward movement. A stop (120) is adjustable 

so as to limit movement of a washer (18, 24) of whichever 
size is being displaced. A measuring bar (160) is mounted 

via the stop. A screw gun (60), provides a primary 
handle, and a secondary handle (200) are mounted to an
 
upright element (62, 64) so as to be independently 

adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to improvements in a machine 
for dispensing stackable roofing washers individually from 
a stack of such washers and for driving fasteners through 
such washers. Such a machine is useful for fastening one 
or more layers of roofing material to an underlayment. A machine for dispensing stackable roofing washers 
individually from a stack of such washers and for driving 
fasteners through such washers is exemplified in Beach et 
al. U.S. Patents No. 4,890,968, No. 5,042,142, and No. 
5,056,684. Such a machine is useful for fastening one or 
more layers of roofing material, such as a roofing membrane 
or one or more layers of roofing insulation, to an 
underlayment. As exemplified in the patents noted above, the 
washer-dispensing features of the machine comprise a base, 
a shuttle mounted movably to the base, and a mechanism for 
moving the shuttle. The shuttle is movable to a washer-releasing 
position relative to the base and to a washer-engaging 
position relative thereto and is biased to the 
washer-releasing position. The shuttle is adapted to 
remove a lowermost washer from the stack and to cause 
movement of the lowermost washer to a discharge position by 
positive engagement of the shuttle with the lowermost 
washer when moved from the washer-engaging position to the 
washer-releasing position. The shuttle-moving mechanism, 
which is actuatable by a user, moves the shuttle from the 
washer-releasing position to the washer-engaging position 
when actuated. Such mechanism, which is deactuated 
normally, permits the shuttle to return to the washer-releasing 
position when deactuated. Such washer-dispensing 
and fastener-driving machines are available commercially 
from ITW Buildex (a division of Illinois Tool Works Inc.) 
of Itasca, Illinois, under its ACCUTRAC trademark.  
 Stackable roofing washers useful in such washer-dispensing 
and fastener-driving machines are available 
commercially from ITW Buildex, supra, in plural sizes 
having different features and including relatively large, 
generally square, stamped steel washers and relatively 
small, generally circular, stamped steel washers with 
plastic inserts. As used commonly over a layer of roofing 
insulation, such relatively large, generally square, 
stamped steel washers are exemplified in Beach et al. U.S. 
Patents No. 4,890,968 and No. 5,042,142. As used commonly 
over roofing membranes, such relatively small, generally 
circular, stamped steel washers with plastic inserts are 
exemplified in Beach et al. U.S.

<CLAIMS>
A washer-dispensing machine for dispensing stackable 
roofing washers individually from a stack of similar 

washers comprising: 

(a) a base (30); 
(b) a shuttle (50) mounted movably to the base (30), 
movable to a washer-releasing position relative to the base 

and to a washer-engaging position relative thereto, biased 
to the washer-releasing position, and adapted to displace 

a lowermost washer (18, 24) from the stack and to cause 
movement of the lowermost washer to a separated position by 

positive engagement of the shuttle with the lowermost 
washer when moved from the washer-engaging position to the 

washer-releasing position; 
(c) means (68) actuatable by a user and deactuated 
normally for moving the shuttle (50) from the washer-releasing 

position to the washer-engaging position when 
actuated and for permitting the shuttle (50) to move from 

the washer-engaging position to the washer-releasing 
position when deactuated, and 
(d) means for restraining the washer overlying the 
lowermost washer against being displaced with the lowermost 

washer when the shuttle (50) is moved from the washer-engaging 
position to the washer-releasing position, the 

washer-restraining means including a gate (100) movable 
vertically toward and away from a lower position wherein 

the gate provides sufficient clearance for the lowermost 
washer from the stack to pass beneath the gate to the 

separated position but insufficient clearance for any 
overlying wash
er also to pass beneath the gate, the gate 
being biased toward the lower position;
