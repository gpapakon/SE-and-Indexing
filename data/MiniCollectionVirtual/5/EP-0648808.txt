<ABSTRACT>
A cellulose molding solution excellent in flow and moldability and suitable for producing moldings such 
as fiber or film, which solution is prepared by mixing a component [I]
 comprising a cellulose having a degree of 
polymerization of 500 to 2,000 with a component [II]
 comprising at least one member selected from among celluloses 
having a degree of polymerization of 350 to 900, which is 90 % or less of that of t
he cellulose of component [I], 

cellulose derivatives and polysaccharides in a ratio of the component [I] to the component [II]
 of 95:5 to 50:50 by 
weight, and dissolving the obtained mixture in a solvent mixture composed of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide and a 

solvent which can be homogeneously mixed therewith but cannot dissolve cellulose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cellulose
solution for shaping and a method of shaping the same.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
cellulose solution capable of stably forming therefrom
filaments or films at a high velocity and a method of
shaping the cellulose solution, especially a spinning
method of the cellulose filaments.The viscose rayon method and cupro-ammonia method
are well known as methods for producing cellulose
filaments or fibers. These conventional methods are
disadvantageous in that the solvents for cellulose are
difficult to recycle and the discharge of the solvent
causes environmental pollution.In consideration of environmental safety, Japanese
Examined Patent Publication No. 60-28848 (which
corresponds to U.S Patent Nos. 4,246,221 and 4,416,698)
discloses a method of producing shaped cellulose
articles, for example, filaments or fibers or films, by
dissolving cellulose in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide to
provide a dope solution, and then shaping the cellulose
dope solution. This method is advantageous in that the
solvent for cellulose can be recovered from the dope
solution and reused.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 4-308220
or the corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,252,284 discloses
a method of spinning the cellulose solution similar to
that mentioned above through a spinning nozzle having a
small hole diameter at a low spinning draft to form small
denier filaments.Generally, the solution of cellulose in
N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide has a high viscosity and 
exhibites significant elastomeric behavior. Since this
high viscosity solution is difficult to deform, it is
difficult to make a large spinning draft ratio (the ratio
of the take-up velocity to an extruding velocity of
solution through a nozzle orifice).Also, where the shaping procedure is carried out by
using a nozzle having a small orifice diameter or a slit
having a small width, an increase in the extrusion rate
of the solution results in the generation of melt
fractures which means a melt flow instability of the
solution through a nozzle orifice. Therefore, the
shaping conditions under which the solution can be stably
shaped are limited to a range in which melt fractures are
not generated, and this limitation reduces productivity.To conduct the shaping procedure without
reducing the productivity, the viscosity of the solution
is reduced. Where a low viscosity solution is used, the
generation of melt fractures is restricted and thus the
shaping stability of the solution is enhanced. Also,
since a low
