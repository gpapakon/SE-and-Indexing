System for the analysis of sample liquids comprising:

a measuring instrument (1) with a source of radiation, radiation receiver,
evaluation and display device and
a storage container (2) for holding test elements

wherein the test elements (20) are sealed onto a foil (16) in such a manner
that test zones (24) located on the test elements are sealed in a water-vapour-tight

manner by means of the sealing of the test elements on the foil.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which a test element is transported from the
storage container by means of the foil.
System as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which a test zone (24) of the test element
is made accessible by peeling the foil from the test element.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the test element has a pin (21) which is
surrounded by a sheath (23) which protrudes above the pin and is attached to

the foil.
System as claimed in claim 1 or 4, in which the test elements (20) have a test
zone (24) on the front side of a transparent pin.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the test elements are linked together by
the foil (16) and the system has devices (17, 18) with which the test elements

that are linked together by the foil are transported through the storage
container (2) by winding the foil onto a spool core (17) and a test element 

emerging from the storage container is detached from the foil (16) by means
of a roller (18) or an edge.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the source of radiation and the
radiation receiver are arranged on the side of the test zone that is opposite to

that of sample application.
System as claimed in claim 1, which has a pin (26) with an optical system (25)
and the pin (26) can make a relative movement such that a test element can

be transported from the opening of the storage container into a sample
application position using the pin (26).
System as claimed in claim 1 in which a spiral (15) is located inside the
storage container which stabilizes a spiral arrangement of test elements.
Storage container (2) for test elements (20) for the analysis of sample liquids
comprising an arrangement of test elements which are sealed onto a foil (16)

in such a manner that test zones (24) located on the test elements are sealed in
a water-vapour-tight manner by means of the sealing of the test elements on

the foil.
Storage container as claimed in claim 10 containing a spiral (15) in its interior

which stabilizes a spiral arrangement of test elements.
Storage container as claimed in claim 10, wherein the foil is attached to the
sheath (23) of each test element (20) in such a manner that the test zone (24)

prevents access of air humidity.
Storage container as claimed in claim 10 comprising an edge or roller (18)
over which the foil can be pulled in order to detach a test element from the

foil. 
Method for the analysis of sample liquids using test elements that are sealed
onto a foil (16) and are linked together by the foil comprising the steps:


a) transporting a test element from the storage container by means of the
foil (16)
b) opening the seal of the test element by pulling off the foil (16) from the
test element such that a test zone (24) of the test element becomes

accessible
c) applying a sample liquid onto the test element
d) carrying out the measuring process while irradiating the test element
and measuring the reflected or transmitted radiation
e) calculating an analytical result from the measurement
f) ejecting the used test element from the system.
Method as claimed in claim 14 in which in step a) the foil (16) is wound on by
means of a spool core (17) and in step b) the foil (16) is pulled off from the

test element by guiding the foil (16) over a roller (18) or an edge.
Arrangement of test elements (20) in which the test elements are sealed onto a
foil (16) which is essentially impermeable to water vapour in such a manner

that the sealing onto the foil protects the test zones (24) of the test elements
from access of water vapour.
Arrangement of test elements as claimed in claim 16 in which the foil is
attached to a sheath (23) of each test element (20).
