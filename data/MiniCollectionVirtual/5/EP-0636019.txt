<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to post-foaming shaving gel 
compositions absent a secondary non-ionic surfactant having 
excellent skin conditioning properties. The practice of removing hair from the body extends back 
through recorded history. A number of different methods to remove 
hair have been used. Shaving hairs or whiskers off at skin level 
using a sharpened blade, or razor, is probably the best known of 
such methods. Topical compositions, or shaving aids are continually being 
developed not only to make shaving easier, but, to achieve a 
closer, less skin irritating shave. One such composition is a 
shaving cream. Shaving creams are used particularly by men for 
removing beard growth from their faces; aerosol shaving creams 
being the best known. Aerosol shaving creams, usually packaged in 
pressurized metal cans, are white, voluminous, creamy foams, are 
disclosed in U.S.-A-3,330,730, Hernandez, issued July 11, 
1967; US-A-3,655,865, Murphy, issued April 11, 1972 and US-A-3,923,970, 
Breuer, issued December 2, 1975. A relatively recent shaving composition is the post-foaming 
shaving gel. These compositions are designed to be dispensed from 
the can as a clear, translucent gel, which is converted to a foam 
when rubbed into the palm or against the face. Such compositions 
are described in U.S.-A-3,541,581, Monson, issued November 
17, 1970; U.S.-A-4,528,111, Su, issued July 9,1985; U.S.-A-4,957,732, 
Grollier et al., issued September 18,1990; U.S.-A-5,034,220, Helioff 
et al, issued July 23,1991; GB-A-1,279,145, 
published June 28, 1972 and GB-A-1,444,334, published 
July 28, 1976; and WO-A-91/07943, Chauduri, 
published June 13, 1991.  
 Since shaving, particularly daily shaving, can irritate the 
skin around the neck and face manufacturers of the shaving 
compositions often add ingredients to minimize skin irritation, 
and impart good skin feel both during and after shaving. These 
ingredients include humectants, emollients, and moisturizers. 
Such ingredients include aloe, menthol, lanolin, yucca, silicones, 
and other ingredients known for use in cosmetic compositons. 
Additional ingredients may be be added to impart therapeutic 
benefits to the skin. These ingredients include antiseptics for 
treating razor cuts and nicks. It is known in the art that silicone oils form a protective 
coating on the skin by filling the crevices and follicular 
openings of the skin. This protective coating reduces water loss 
through the stratum corneum and avoids tightening of the skin. 
Silicones are also
