<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a connector which prevents 
female and male terminals from coupling partially to 

each other upon coupling and detaching of female and 
male connectors. in the assembly, the male connector 

is provided with a guide rod (13) which projects in a 
coupling direction. The female connector is provided 

with a guide hold (20) through which the guide rod 
passes. Upon coupling of both connectors, the guide 

rod passes through the guide hole to position an 
insertion direction. The male terminal enters the 

female terminal without inclining and partially 
contacting.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector assembly and
more particularly to a connector assembly comprising a male
connector and a female connector.For convenience of explanation, a conventional
connector assembly will be described below by referring to
FIG. 13. FIG. 13 is a longitudinal sectional view of the
conventional connector assembly.In the conventional connector assembly, as shown in
FIG. 13, a male housing 61 is provided on one side with
a male hood 62 in which male terminals 63 project outwardly.
On the other hand, female terminals 65 are attached in
a mating female housing 64. When both housings 61 and 64
are coupled to each other, the male terminals 63 are fitted
in the female terminals 65, respectively. Upon coupling
of both housings 61 and 64, they are coupled to each other
after they are completely opposed. Accordingly, even if
they are being coupled to each other in an inclined posture,
their relative insertion direction is gradually corrected by
the male hood 62.However, when a distal end of the male terminal 63
reaches an inlet 66 of the female housing 64, the coupling
directions of the male and female terminals 63 and 64 are
not coincidental with each other and there a small angle Î±
(FIG. 13) exists between the coupling directions.
Consequently, the distal end of the male terminal 63 is
inserted into the female terminal 65 while the distal end
partially contacts with the insertion port 66 or a coupling
aperture of the female terminal 65. The male terminal 63
may be bent by such partial contact.In the case where coupling and detaching of the male
and female terminals under partial contacts are repeated or
where coupling and detaching of the male terminal 63 under
its partial contact due to its deflection are repeated, the
distal end of the male terminal 63 is worn and this results 
in a failure of an electrical contact between the male and female terminals
63 and 65. In particular, in a connector with a gold-plating layer for
enhancing reliability of contact, the gold-plating layer will become worn.In addition, manual work of fitting an end face of the female
housing 64 to the male hood 62 tends to be carried out roughly. When
the female housing 64 is forcibly fitted to the hood 62 while the
housing 64 is inclined, the end face of the housing 64 pushes slantwise
against an opening edge of the male hood 62 and they may be deformed or
broken.We are also aware of European Patent Application No.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A connector assembly comprising a male connector (1) having a
projecting male terminal (3) and a male hood (10) around the male

terminal coupled to a female connector (2) having a female terminal (4) to
interconnect the male and female terminals, in which;


a first one of said male and female connectors is provided with a
guide rod (13) projecting in a coupling direction and having a distal end

remote from said first connector, and a second one of the connectors is
provided with a guide hole (24) for introducing the guide rod and a rear

face at the end of said guide hole furthest from said first connector, said
rear face facing away from the first connector, so that a coupling

direction of the female terminal (4) is constrained in an extending
direction of the male terminal (3) when the guide hole (24) introduces the

guide rod (13) so that a distal end of the male terminal (3) contacts with a
distal end of the female terminal (4),
the guide hole extends through the second connector in the coupling
direction thereof and the guide rod has a length longer than that of the

guide hole in the coupling direction, so that the distal end of the guide rod
(13) extends through the second connector and projects beyond the rear

facing face, and characterised in that said male hood surrounds a front
portion of said female connector when said male and female connectors

are fully interconnected, and in that said guide rod (13) projects beyond
said male hood so that when said male and female connectors are initially

connected, said guide rod (13) enters said guide hole before said male
hood surrounds said female connector.
A connector assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in that
said guide rod and hole (13, 24) are circular in cross section. 
A connector assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in that
said guide rod and hole (13, 24) are polygonal in cross section.
The connector assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in that
said male hood (10) surrounds a front portion of said female connector.
