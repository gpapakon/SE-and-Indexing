<ABSTRACT>
An adder (20), a quantizer (22), and a variable integrator (24) 
execute A/D conversion and the result is stored in a memory (12). 

A time constant of the variable integrator at this time 
is controlled by a time constant controller (25). On the other 

hand, data from the memory is integrated by a variable 
integrator (28) to provide an analog signal. At this time, 

control data of the time constant controller (25) is 
transferred via a memory (32) to a time constant controller (33), 

which then uses the transferred control data to control the 
time constant of the variable integrator (28). When a mode is 

changed, switches (34 and 35) are turned off. Therefore, a 
signal with no input can be written into the memory (12) for 

initializing the memory (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a delay circuit using an A/D
converter, a memory, and a D/A converter used to produce a
surround sound of an audio machine, etc.Hitherto, a surround sound of an audio machine has been
produced by delaying a reproduced sound for a predetermined
time, attenuating, and superposing the resulting sound. Such
reproduction modes as a stadium mode and a church mode adapt
different manners of delaying and superposing reproduced
sounds.One of the delay circuits used for such purposes is
shown in Figure 1. In the circuit, an analog reproduction
signal is temporarily converted into digital data by an A/D
converter 10 and the digital data is stored in a memory 12.
The data read from the memory 12 is converted back into
analog data by a D/A converter 14. In the circuit, the delay
of the read timing from the write timing is varied and the
difference therebetween becomes a delay time.Used as the A/D converter 10 is one as shown in Figure
2. The A/D converter 10 comprises an adder 20, a quantizer
22, a variable integrator 24, and a time constant controller
26; an analog output of the variable integrator 24 is fed 
back into the adder 20 to which an analog signal is input.
The quantizer 22 comprises a comparator 22a which outputs
high or low in response to input signal voltage and a latch
circuit 22b which latches the output of the comparator 22a in
response to a predetermined clock for converting an input
signal into a 1-bit digital signal. The variable integrator
24 integrates outputs of the quantizer 22 for providing an
analog signal corresponding to the input signal. The output
of the variable integrator 24 is fed back into the adder 20,
which then finds a difference between both the signals; for
the input signal with no change, the quantizer 22 outputs
high and low alternately.On the other hand, the controller 26 changes a time
constant in the variable integrator 24 in response to the
output condition of the quantizer 22. That is, if the output
level of the adder 20 is large and the quantizer 22 makes an
unbalanced output between "0" and "1," the time constant of
the variable integrator 24 is made small; if the output level
of the adder 20 is small and the quantizer 22 outputs "0" and
"1" keeping a balance therebetween, the time constant of the
variable integrator 24 is made large. Under such control,
when there is no sound, the time constant can be made large
to suppress occurrence of high-frequency noise; when the
input signal changes, the time constant can be made small to
output a high
