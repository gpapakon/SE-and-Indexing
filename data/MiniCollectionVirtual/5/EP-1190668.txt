<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide an ear type
clinical thermometer in which the main body can be held

according to the position of the eardrum of the person whose
temperature is being measured. There is provided an ear type

clinical thermometer comprising: a main body to be held by hand
at a time when an eardrum temperature is to be measured; and

a probe fixed to the main body while protruding from the main
body and to be inserted into an external auditory canal of a

person whose eardrum temperature is to be measured at the time
when the measurement
 is to be taken. The main body has a side
at which the probe protrudes from the main body and a side

opposite to this side, and the side opposite to the side at which
the probe protrudes from the main body is constructed of a curved

surface having a substantially constant curvature along a
direction perpendicular to a reference plane containing the

center axis of the probe. Further, the main body has an
indicator for allowing a user to recognize a plurality of

methods of holding the main body which differ according to
directions in which the probe is to be inserted into the external

auditory canal of the person whose temperature is to be
measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an ear type clinical
thermometer for measuring a temperature of an eardrum by detecting
infrared rays emitted from the eardrum.There was proposed an ear type clinical thermometer for
measuring a temperature of an eardrum by measuring infrared rays
emitted from an eardrum, measuring the rays by means of an infrared
ray sensor in noncontact way. The ear type clinical thermometer
substantially has the following construction. Namely, the ear type
clinical thermometer has a main body and a probe which projects
outward from the main body and is inserted into an ear hole (i.e.,
external auditory canal) When the eardrum temperature is to be
measured. On the interior of the main body there are mounted the
infrared ray sensor for detecting infrared rays which have penetrated
into the inside of the probe from the eardrum when the probe was
inserted into the external auditory canal, and a microcomputer for
calculating the eardrum temperature based on the results of the
detection performed by the infrared ray sensor. The eardrum 
temperature calculated by the microcomputer is displayed on a display
device provided to the main body.When a user is to measure the eardrum temperature, he grips
the main body and inserts the probe into the external auditory canal
of a person whose eardrum temperature is to be measured, and then
the user presses a start-measuring switch. When this occurs, the
infrared ray sensor detects the infrared rays from the eardrum,
and the microcomputer causes the eardrum temperature obtained on
the basis of the infrared rays detected to be displayed on the display
device. The user references the eardrum temperature displayed on
the display device, whereby he learns the body temperature of the
person who was measured.When the eardrum temperature is to be measured, the user grips
the main body and inserts the probe into the external auditory canal,
thus assuming the posture taken at the time when the measuring is
to be performed. In order to make the measuring posture (i.e., the
ear type clinical thermometer's appropriate positioning vis-Ã -vis
the body) easier to assume, innovations were made to the conventional
ear type clinical thermometer in order to make it easier for the
user to grip its main body.For example, in an ear type clinical thermometer disclosed
in U. S. Patent. No. 4,993,424 (hereinafter, referred to as "precedent
example 1"), a gun grip is provided to the main body and the user
grips the gun grip, whereby the measuring posture becomes easier
