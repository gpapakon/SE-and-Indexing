<ABSTRACT>
Retaining means for the vibration-isolated fastening of an essentially plate-like machine element having at least one cutout. The retaining means comprises a hollow-cylindrical sleeve (1) which consists of a hard/tough material and is radially enclosed, in a relatively non-rotatable manner, by an elastomeric material body (2) on the outer side. The material body (2) exhibits an annular groove (3) which encloses the sleeve (1) and has an axial extent corresponding essentially to the thickness of the machine element in the region of the cutout and has a groove base (4) adapted to the shape of the cutout. The groove base (4) and the boundary of the cutout can be brought into engagement with one another, with elastic prestressing.

A holder for vibration decoupling fastening of a 
substantially disc-shaped machine element, having at 

least one recess, the holder comprising a hollow-cylindrical 
sleeve (1) which is made of a tough material and 

is surrounded in the radial direction on the outside by 
an elastomer material body (2) so as to be relatively 

non-rotable, the material body (2) having an annular 
groove (3) which surrounds the sleeve (1), having an 

axial extent which substantially corresponds to the 
thickness of the machine element in the region of the 

recess, and having a groove base (4) which is adapted to 
the shape of the recess, it being possible for the groove 

base (4) and the boundary of the recess to be brought 
into engagement with one another under elastic prestress, 

and the groove base (4) having at least three elevations 
(8.1, 8.2, 8.3;...) which are distributed evenly in the 

circumferential direction and extend radially in the 
direction of the boundary of the recess, characterized in 

that the radial elevations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3,...) have an 
axially shorter extent than corresponds to the width of 

the annular groove (3), such that annular cavities are 
produced in the annular groove (3) on both sides of the 

radial elevations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3,...), which cavities are 
bounded radially on the outside by the boundary of the 

recess and radially on the inside by the groove base (4), 
and which are connected to one another axially via the 

gaps formed in the circumferential direction between the 
radial elevations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3,...). 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the elevations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3,...) are designed to  

 
be sinusoidal and to merge into one another. 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the elevations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3,...) are formed by 

eight cams arranged in the radial direction. 
A holder according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, by virtue of the manufacture, the 

material body (2) is of integral design. 
A holder according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the material body (2) is of three-part 

design, in that the annular groove (3) is bounded by a 
bush (5) surrounding the sleeve (1) and forming the groove 

base (4) and by two circular annular discs (6, 7), and in 
that the discs (6, 7) and the sleeve (1) connected to the 

bush (5) are designed to be plugged together. 
A holder according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the bush (5) and the discs (6, 7) are formed by 

materials having different damping properties. 
A holder according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the material body (2) is provided 

in each case with a friction-reducing surface coating at 
least on the mutually facing axial boundary surfaces (9, 10) 

of the annular groove (3). 
A holder according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the surface coating is formed by a PTFE film (11), 

and in that the film (11) and the boundary surfaces (9, 10) 
are adhesively connected. 
A holder according to any one of claim 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the material body (2) has a rigidity 

under loads acting axially in the direction of a side 
bounding the annular groove (3) which is 10 to 80, 

preferably 40 to 60, times greater than the rigidity under 
loads acting radially on the bush (5). 
A holder according to claim 9, characterized by 
the use for receiving an airbag in the steering wheel of 

a motor vehicle.
