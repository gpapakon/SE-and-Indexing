<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to endless belts and, more particularly, to a wide belt that
can be used to cooperate with a rotating toothed wheel on a corrugated board paper
production line.In one known corrugated board paper producing apparatus, steam is used to heat
a core paper to make it more pliable. The core paper is fed stepwise between a pair of
toothed rollers which have meshed teeth that produce a uniform, undulating pattern for
the core paper. Starch paste is applied on the crests of the formed core paper. In a
separate line, the coated, formed core paper is mated with a liner paper which is fed to
a press machine, which has cooperating rollers and a heat resistant backing belt. The
formed core paper and liner paper are then bonded together to define a completed sheet
which can be formed as desired. Because the formation of the core paper, bonding of
the core and liner paper, and sheet forming steps are separately carried out, this type
of system is generally relatively inefficient.To simplify the above system, and enhance production efficiency, it is known
to combine in a single procedure the steps of forming the core paper with the
cooperating toothed rolls, pressing the formed paper through a toothed wheel against
a backing belt, and bonding the formed core paper to a liner paper. One modified form of corrugated board paper producing apparatus is shown
schematically at 10 in Fig. 3. A core paper 12 is fed continuously between a pair of
cooperating rolls 14, 16. The rolls 14, 16 have equidistantly spaced, peripheral teeth
18, 20, which are meshed as the rolls 14, 16 rotate about their respective, parallel axes
22, 24. The meshing teeth 18,20 produce corrugations in the core paper 12.A coating mechanism 26 applies a starch paste to the crests 28 on the formed
core paper 12 as it is advanced in the direction of the arrow 30.The corrugated core paper 12 is continuously applied to a liner paper 32,
advancing in the direction of the arrow 34, at a station 36. At the station 36, a wide belt
40 is trained around a pair of spaced rollers 42, 44. At the station 36, heat is applied
to the corrugated core paper 12 from a source 46 through at least one of the rollers 42,
44, the belt 40 and roll 16. The heat vaporizes water absorbed by the corrugated core
paper 12.The rollers 42, 44 are situated so that the teeth 20 on the roll 16 bear against the
outside surface 48 of the belt 40, over a substantial circumferential extent, as the
system operates. The teeth 20 maintain the proper registration of the
