<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
manufacturing system with a self-diagnosing function and a
self-diagnosing method thereof, and more particularly to a
semiconductor manufacturing system with a self-diagnosing
function and a self-diagnosing method thereof, for inspecting
the positioning accuracy, mechanical accuracy, rotational
accuracy and the like of a semiconductor manufacturing system
such as a dicing machine.In JP-A-63-080529 there is desclosed a semiconductor manufacturing system,
in which distances I1 - I4 and I'1 - I'4 between an alignment mark RM on a
reticle and an alignment mark WM on a wafer are measured so as to
determine a positioning error of the X-Y-plane.There are many semiconductor manufacturing systems which
have a moving mechanism for three axes such as X, Y and Z axes
and rotary mechanism, etc. turning about these axes. For
example, when a wafer is aligned by a dicing machine, a wafer
table mounted thereon is moved in directions of X
and Y axes and the wafer table is rotated about its center, so
that the wafer can be aligned.In recent years, miniaturization of a semiconductor chip
is planned, and there is required a semiconductor manufacturing
system of high accuracy for manufacturing thus miniaturized
semiconductor chip. However, even the semiconductor
manufacturing system, which has been originally manufactured
with high accuracy, deteriorates in the accuracy thereof due to
mechanical wear, slight loosing of screws and and the like
in the course of the operating time. Accordingly, it is necessary
that the semiconductor manufacturing system is inspected in
each predetermined operating period, and, for inspecting the  
accuracy of the system, a reference wafer is used
for example. On the surface of the reference wafer
there are formed patterns for
inspecting at regular intervals. When this reference wafer
is used in a dicing machine for
example, the reference wafer is
moved in directions of X and Y axes to detect the regular
patterns, and the thus detected position is compared with an
interval between patterns to
thereby inspect the accuracy of the dicing machine as a manufacturing system.In the standard reference wafer, the
patterns are formed at regular intervals. Hence,
the accuracy of the dicing machine at the time of moving by a
predetermined interval can be inspected, however, the accuracy
of the dicing machine at the time of moving by a random interval
can not be inspected. However, when a wafer is worked on by the
dicing machine actually, the dicing machine is
