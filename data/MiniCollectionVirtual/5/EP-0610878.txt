<ABSTRACT>
A corner cupboard, in particular kitchen corner cupboard, has rotatable shelving which comprises at least one shelf (9) connected to a rotating column (8). The shelf (9) has a recess (12) running from the periphery of the shelf to the central area of the shelf, via which recess the shelf (9) can be pushed onto the rotating column (8) from the side and the inner end of which forms a bearing surface (15) for the rear side of the rotating column (8). The front side of the rotating column (8) is assigned a holding device which is to be mounted on the shelf (9) in the region of the recess (12) and is intended for securing the shelf (9) in position on the rotating column (8). The holding device has a clamping part (16) supported on the shelf (9), between which clamping part and the bearing surface (15) of the shelf (9) the rotating column (8) can be non-positively gripped.
