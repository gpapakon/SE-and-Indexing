<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to providing a medicinal rod with a shell. The shell is formed from a hose, which is expanded by pressurizing its inner space. The medicinal rod is pushed into the expanded hose, after which the pressure is relieved. The hose tightens over the rod after the pressure relief.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an equipment for providing 
a medicinal rod with a shell. The medicinal rod may 
be comprised e.g. of a medicine embedded in a plastic 
material, which medicine is intended to diffuse from the 
plastic material carrier over a long period of time. The 
plastic material may be a silicone plastic and the medicine 
may be e.g. a contraceptive substance. For controlling 
the release of the medicine more accurately, the 
medicinal rod is provided with a shell, i.e. the medicine 
is encapsulated. Such a shell, which is comprised e.g. of 
silicone plastic, is tightened around the medicinal rod 
for achieving a proper capsule. Said capsule may be installed 
on a suitable fastener e.g. for inserting it inside 
the womb. In the inventive equipment, as disclosed in claim 1, the above-mentioned 
capsule provided with a shell is prepared by starting from a 
tubular or hose-like shell material, whose inner diameter 
is less than the outer diameter of the medicinal rod, as 
well as from a medicinal rod. In the equipment, the shell 
hose is expanded such that the medicinal rod may be 
inserted inside it, after which the shell hose is allowed 
to tighten over the inserted medicinal rod. In the equipment, 
the expansion of the shell hose has been achieved 
by blowing compressed air inside the hose. The construction of the inventive equipment as well as 
its operation appear best on the basis of the accompanying 
drawing and on a description related thereto. In the drawing: 
Fig. 1 shows the equipment at the start of an operating 
sequence, or in the insertion step of a shell hose and a 
medicinal rod to be encapsulated;  
 Fig. 2 shows the equipment in the following operating 
step, after a sufficient shell hose length has been fed 
in and when the medicinal rod to be encapsulated is in 
its positioner; Fig. 3 shows the equipment in the initial situation of 
the insertion step of the medicinal rod; Fig. 4 shows the equipment in the expansion step of the 
shell hose by utilizing compressed air blown inside the 
hose; Fig. 5 shows the equipment in a step, where the medicinal 
rod is inserted into the expanded shell hose; Fig. 6 shows the equipment at the final step of the insertion 
of the medicinal rod; Fig. 7 is a more detailed partial view of the initial 
step of the insertion of the medicinal rod; Fig. 8 is a more detailed partial view of the finishing 
step of a coated medicinal capsule; Fig. 9 shows the equipment in the finishing step of the 
medicinal capsule; Fig. 10 shows the

<CLAIMS>
An equipment for providing a fixed-size medicinal rod 
(8) with a shell, by means of which equipment the medicinal 

rod is placed in a hose-like shell blank (1) and the 
shell blank is tightened into a shell around the rod, 


characterized
 in that the equipment comprises: 

a feeder (2) for the shell hose (1), which is provided 
with a through-opening (3) for the shell hose of a continuos 

length, which through-opening continues on the 
outlet side of the feeder as a needle-like feed guide 

(3') exceeding the length of the medicinal rod to be encapsulated, 
as well as clamp elements (4) extending into 

the through-opening (3) on its inlet area for grasping 
the shell hose as well as for closing it, which feeder is 

arranged to perform a reciprocating axial feeding movement 
in the direction of the through-opening (3); 
a medicinal-rod inserter (5), which is provided with a 
inserting nose (6) directed towards the shell-hose feeder 

(2), which nose has a through-opening (7) corresponding 
to the outer diameter of the medicinal rod as well as a 

pusher (9) arranged reciprocatively in the opening for 
discharging the medicinal rod (8) placed in the opening 

from the inserting nose towards the shell-hose feeder, 
which inserter (5) for receiving the medicinal rod is arranged 

to perform a reciprocating transverse movement 
relative to the direction of the trough-opening (7), as 

well as a reciprocating axial movement in the direction 
of the trough-opening (7) towards the feeder (2) as well 

as away therefrom for releasing the medicinal rod; 
an expander (10), which is placed between the shell-hose 
feeder (2) and the medicinal-rod inserter (5) to 

cooperate with the medicinal-rod inserter and which is 
provided with an axial seat (11) corresponding to the  

 
outer diameter of the inserting nose (6) for receiving 

the inserting nose, the bottom of which seat is formed 
by expander jaws (12), which are arranged to move away 

from each other in a direction perpendicular to the axial 
direction of the seat and to be joined together correspondingly; 
a connector (13), which is placed between the expander 
(10) and the shell-hose feeder (2) and which comprises a 

through-opening (14) for receiving a feed guide (3') of 
the shell-hose feeder (2), as well as cutting elements 

(15) for trimming the end of the shell coated capsule and 
for separating the capsule from the shell hose; and 
elements for supplying pressurized air to the connector 
(13) via the expander (10). 
An equipment according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that the pressurized air is arranged to be supplied to 

the connector (13) in a space between the inserting nose 
(6) in the seat of the expander (10) and the seat. 
An equipment according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that the pressurized air is arranged to be supplied to 

the connector (13) in a space via an opening (7) of the 
inserting nose (6) in the seat of the expander (10).
