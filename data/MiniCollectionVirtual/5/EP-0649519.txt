<ABSTRACT>
The device for measuring the switching force in railway points has a measuring bolt (5) which can be inserted into a joint in the points drive. At the free end of the measuring bolt there is a head (7) in which is fitted an electromechanical sensor (8). The measuring bolt (5) is precisely adjusted in the joint using a spacer (10) which also facilitates the removal of the measuring bolt after the measurement has been completed.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for measuring the switch setting force at
rail switches, comprising a sensor and a measuring pin (5)

connected with the sensor and designed as a deformation body,
which measuring pin is insertable into a joint provided in the

switch drive, characterized in that the sensor (8) is designed
as an electromechanical sensor and is arranged beyond the

point of impact on the measuring pin (5) within a head (7)
connected with the measuring pin.
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in
that the head (7) is designed to be slitted transverse to the

axis of the pin (5) for receiving the measuring sensor (8).
An arrangement according to claims 1 and 2, characterized

in that the head (7) forms a stop shoulder (14) for an
intermediate piece (10) destined to receive the measuring

sensor (8), the intermediate piece (10) having working sites
(17) for a tool for extracting the measuring pin (5) and

embracing a portion of the joint in which the measuring pin
(5) is inserted.
An arrangement according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the measuring pin (5) is designed to be

slitted in the axial direction and that the axial slit (16)
extends as far as to the first slit (11) of the head (7)

extending transverse to the axis of the pin (5).
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the head (7) comprises two slits (11)

offset in the axial direction.
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the stop shoulder (14) of the head (7)

has a contour that deviates from the circular shape in respect
of axial symmetry and cooperates with a recess or with

projections of the intermediate piece (10) with a view to
securing the rotary position.
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the sensor (8) is connected with a

standard interface via a signal amplifier and an 
analog/digital converter, in particular, with a serial

interface comprising a computer having a storage and a
display.
