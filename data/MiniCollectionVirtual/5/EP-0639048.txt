<ABSTRACT>
Biologically active material is encapsulated by first blending such material with hardenable liquid, e.g., hardenable by polymerization, followed by dispersing the resultant composition in a non-flowable but stirrable aqueous gel, and hardening the dispersed droplets containing the biologically active material to form a stable dispersion of microcapsules containing such material in the gel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE MICROENCAPSULATION This invention relates to the microencapsulation of biologically active material within polymer particles,- which is useful for slow release of the biologically active material.Handjani et al., U.S. 5,139,783, discloses alginate capsules which may contain a cosmetic active agent such as a biological compound, and which may be contained in an external gel phase. The present compositions differ from those of Handjani et al. in that the biologically active material is introduced during the formation of the microcapsules, not afterwards.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides a process for encapsulating biologically active material in which equipment costs and power needs are low, effective encapsulation of insoluble biological active material is accomplished, microcapsule dispersions of long-term stability are obtained, and such dispersions can be advantageously used.One embodiment of the present invention is-the process for microencapsulating biologically active material, comprising forming a thixotropic gel which is essentially nonflowable but is stirrable without fracturing, forming a substantially homogeneous carrier composition of said biologically active material and hardenable immiscible organic liquid, combining said gel and said homogeneous carrier composition one with the other in a proportion in which said gel is the continuous phase and said homogeneous carrier composition is the dispersed phase in the resultant combination in the presence of stirring of said gel to 

finely disperse said homogeneous carrier composition as droplets in said gel without causing appreciable fracture of said gel, and hardening said droplets to obtain as a result thereof a stable dispersion of microencapsulated biologically active material.Another embodiment of the present invention is the composition comprising a continuous phase of essentially non-flowable aqueous thixotropic gel and fine microcapsules of polymer stably dispersed therein, said microcapsules containing a pesticide.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the process and product of the present invention, the aqueous gel is formed by mixing sufficient water-soluble gelation agent with water to form the gel in the viscous, essentially non-flowable form desired by the present invention. Insufficient amounts of gelation agent merely thicken the resultant solution, such as by forming a colloid, so that the solution is still readily pourable. In such thickened solution r unlike gels, suspended droplets or suspended

_______
What is claimed is:
1. Process for microencapsulating biologically active material, comprising forming a thixotropic gel which is essentially nonflowable but is stirrable without fracturing, forming a substantially homogeneous carrier composition of said biologically active material and a hardenable immiscible organic liquid, combining said gel and said homogeneous carrier composition one with the other in a proportion in which said gel is sufficient to form the continuous phase and said homogeneous carrier composition becomes the dispersed phase in the resultant combination as the result of stirring of said gel which finely disperses said homogeneous composition as droplets in said gel without causing appreciable fracture of said gel, and then hardening said droplets to obtain as a result thereof a stable dispersion of microencapsulated biologically active material.
2. Process of Claim 1 wherein said substantially homogeneous carrier composition is a dispersion of said biologically active material in said hardenable organic liquid. 3. Process of Claim 1 wherein said hardenable liquid comprises polymerizable monomer and said hardening comprises polymerizing said monomer to form said encapsulated biologically active material.
4. Process of Claim 1 wherein said hardenable liquid comprises polymer dissolved in organic solvent and said hardening comprises removing said solvent from said droplets to precipitate said polymer and form said microencapsulated biologically active material.
5. Process of Claim 1 wherein the viscosity of said gel is from 2 to 1200 centepoises (cps) . 


 6. Process of Claim 3 wherein the polymerizable monomer is polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate and polymerizing said monomer comprises adding diethylene triamine. 7. Process of Claim 4 wherein the polymer is poly(methylmethacrylate) , the solvent is ethyl acetate, and removing said solvent comprises allowing the product to stand and allowing the solvent to jnigrate into the aqueous gel. 8. Composition comprising an effective micro- encapsulating amount of a continuous phase of a non- flowable aqueous gel and microcapsules of polymer less than 1000 microns in diameter, stably dispersed therein as indicated by lack of settling during three months at room temperature., said microcapsules containing a pesticide.
9. The composition of Claim 8 wherein said microcapsules containing said pesticide are formed in situ within said aqueous gel.
