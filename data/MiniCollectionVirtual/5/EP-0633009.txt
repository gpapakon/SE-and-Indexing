<ABSTRACT>
An absorptive article comprising a liquid-permeable 
front sheet, a liquid-impermeable back sheet and an 

absorbent placed between the two sheets, said absorbent 
being composed of at least two layers, a first layer 

thereof being placed close to the front sheet and 
composed of hydrophilic fibers and hotmelt-adhesive 

fibers, and a second layer being placed close to the 
back sheet and composed of a highly water-absorptive 

polymer and hotmelt-adhesive fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an absorptive article used
for napkin for menstruation, pad for mother's milk, pad
for incontinence of urine, throwaway diaper, pad for
puerperium, etc. More particularly, it relates to
an absorptive article having a superior liquid-absorptivity
making the best use of the liquid-absorptivity of highly
water-absorptive polymers and in which the body
fluid once absorbed does not return, and also which
compact in its structure.As absorptive articles using hotmelt-adhesive fibers,
mixtures of hydrophilic fibers, hotmelt-adhesive synthetic
crimped fibers and highly water-absorptive polymers have
been so far known (Japanese patent application laid-open
No. Hei 2-74254).Further, Japanese Utility Model publication No. Sho 56-6098
discloses that an absorptive material composed of pulp
fibers, gel-forming substance particles and filaments, can
absorb a large quantity of water and the absorbed water
does not return easily. However, in the above known absorptive
articles, highly water-absorptive polymers have been used .
in admixture in order to increase the water-absorbing
force of pulp fibers or the like, but there have been
raised such problems that the liquid-absorption properties
of the pulp fibers in the absorptive article are so
directional that the absorption is carried out in spots,
and since the absorbed liquid is not efficiently diffused
into the highly water-absorptive polymers, the water-absorptivity
of the polymers cannot be sufficiently
effected. Thus, the highly water-absorptive polymers
have to be used in a quantity exceeding a necessary one
therefor.Further, it is required for the absorptive articles
that the liquid absorbed therein should not return to
the surface thereof. Since the liquid-absorptivity of
the highly water-absorptive polymers is not sufficiently
effected as described above, there has been raised such
a problem that although a large quantity of the highly
water-absorptive polymer is used, it is impossible to
satisfy the above requirement.The present inventors have made extensive research
in order to solve the above-mentioned problem, and as
a result have complete the present invention. EP-A 317,058 describes a laminated structure for use in an absorbent product
comprising a hydrophobic liquid-transfer layer adjacent to a fluid permeable top sheet,
and an absorbent layer. The hydrophobic layer comprises a thermally consolidated
blend of 5% to 50% of thermally bondable hydrophobic fibres and 50% to 95% wood
fluff pulp.PCT/WO 90/04376 describes a multi layer
