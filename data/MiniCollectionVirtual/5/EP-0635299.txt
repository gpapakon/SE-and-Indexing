<ABSTRACT>
Electrodialysis devices are known in which 
fluid flows between a pair of ionically permeable 

membranes. Electrical charge is provided across the 
membranes to extract ions from the fluid flow 

therebetween. Described herein is an improved method 
and apparatus for recovering ions present in a 

pressurized fluid stream. The apparatus comprises a 
series of ion exchange chambers (77, 79, 81, 83) each 

having a first passage (90, 92, 94, 96) for providing 
fluid communication between the ion exchange chambers 

and the pressurized fluid stream and a second fluid 
passage (92, 94, 96, 98) for allowing fluid to exit 

each ion exchange chamber (77, 79, 81, 83). The first 
and second passages (90, 92, 94, 96, 98) are 

positioned such that a substantially spiral vortex is 
created in the pressurized fluid stream as it flows 

through at least one of the ion exchange chambers (77, 
79, 81, 83).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a 
captive vortex high agitation device which is 
particularly useful when used as an electrodialysis 
device for recovering of ions present in a pressurized 
fluid stream. The term "fluid" stands hereinafter for liquid Typical prior art electrodialysis devices 
include a pair of ionically permeable membranes 
between which a flow of fluid is typically provided. 
An electrical charge is provided across the membranes 
so as to produce a current flow therethrough which 
extracts ions from the raw stock fluid flow flowing 
between the membranes. In these devices fluid flow is 
typically in a single direction and is restricted so 
that the fluid flowing between the membranes bounces 
back and forth between the membranes as it flows 
between the membranes. This constricted flow results 
in concentration gradients or boundary layers being 
formed near the membrane surfaces. Effectively, these 
boundary layers add to the thickness of the membranes 
and to the electrical resistance of the cell. This 
generates an opposition to the flow of currents and 
ions, which also contributes to the inefficiency of 
the process and relatively large power consumption. It is known that the efficiency of the 
device can be improved by reducing the thickness of 
the concentration gradient near the surface and thus 
increasing the rate of mass transfer between the 
membranes and the solutions. Typical prior art 
solutions suggested involve increasing the flow rate 
through the device. However, the problem has been 
that this solution tends to require an extremely large 
duct and the addition of small pressure pumps. The present invention provides an improved 
device which has improved mass and/or heat transfer 
and efficiently converts some of the energy of the  
 
pressurized fluid into high speed internal fluid 
motion. The present invention also has the advantage 
of providing various degrees of freedom so that the 
hydraulic impedance of the device can be fitted easily 
to conventional plumbing and pumps. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided apparatus for recovering 
ions present in a pressurized liquid stream 
comprising:- 
at least one ion exchange chamber comprising 
a first ionically permeable wall, a second ionically 
permeable wall spaced from the first wall, an entrance 
passage for said pressurized stream, and an exit 
passage so that said pressurized liquid flows along 
and between said walls; an anode and a cathode disposed on opposite 
side
