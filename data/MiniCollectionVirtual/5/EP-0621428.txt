<ABSTRACT>
A rotary valve noise attenuator (32) with a rotary 
ball control element (22) and a noise attenuator member 

mounted in the ball having multiple, elongated, 
substantially enclosed channels (48) formed across the valve 

opening to split the flow stream into several smaller 
flow streams. The c
hannel walls are perforated (36) so each 
smaller flow stream is further dispersed and diffused 

into many minute flow streams after entering the 
channel. A noise attenuator constructed of several 

corrugated sections fixed crest to crest to form 
several diamond shaped channels across the valve 

opening each having four side walls with holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid control 
valves and more particularly to rotary valve noise 
attenuator devices for such valves. The European Patent Application EP-A-0 123 408, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, discloses a 
throttling ball valve with an array of spaced horizontal 
plates secured across the flow passage through a ball. The 
leading edges of the plates are stream-lined so that the 
flow stream will be divided into a plurality of laminar 
flow streams. In one embodiment, the plates can form 
elongated channels extending across the bore inlet end of 
the fluid control ball member. Each channel comprises four 
side walls and a front end. The front ends of the channels 
split the stream flow into several respective smaller 
laminar flow streams. Devices are commercially available for 
placement into a fluid stream to reduce noise otherwise 
resulting from a jet or other highly concentrated fluid 
stream flowing in a conduit and through standard 
pipeline components, such as control valves, line 
connectors, pipeline instrumentation, etc. One example 
of such a noise attenuator is described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,402,485 (A. Fagerlund), owned by the present 
assignee. This patent describes a plurality of nested 
perforated tubes eccentrically arranged and disposed in 
substantially parallel relationship to each other along 
the axis longitudinal of the conduit. Generally, such noise attenuators as shown in 
the aforementioned patent as well as other proposed 
structures are located in a conduit adjacent and 
immediately downstream of a fluid control valve, such 
as a rotary valve. Thus, the normal fluid noise 
resulting from the turbulent flow of a jet stream upon 
initiating opening and closing of the control valve 
will be attenuated by such noise attenuating devices. 
More recently, commercial noise attenuator devices have 
become available in which the noise attenuator is 
mounted within a rotary control member of the fluid 
control valve in a combined structure. The combined 
structure is generally desirable in order to ease the 
maintenance of such fluid control valves in that 
removal of the rotary control member simultaneously 
removes the noise attenuator for servicing or routine 
maintenance. This combination also is desirable so as  
  
 
to aid in obtaining standard valve flange face to face 
dimensions for valves with or without a noise 
attenuator device. One such commercially available combined 
rotary control and noise attenuator device utilizes a 
series of perforated
