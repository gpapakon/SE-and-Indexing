<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for checking the condition of adhesive 
application in the form of beads on packages, characterized by the 

steps of causing each package to pass through a light reception area (2a) 
of an infrared sensor so as to receive infrared energy radiating from 

the beads (4) on the package, detecting a signal output by the sensor (2) 
in 

response to the received energy so as to measure at least one of a 
peak value corresponding to the rise of the received energy, a peak 

value corresponding to the fall thereof, and a period of time from the 
rise to the fall; and comparing an obtained value with a reference 

value so as to determine the condition of the beads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a system for
checking the condition or quality of adhesive application on an
automatic merchandize packaging line.On the automatic merchandize packaging line thermal adhesive
is applied to the flaps of the packages, mainly made of cardboard,
spot by spot by means of a gun or the like. The deposit of adhesive
in each spot form a bead so that as a whole a plurality of beads are
aligned along the edges of the flaps of packages. In this way the
flaps of the packages are heat sealed. However, a problem arises in
automatically applying adhesive on the flaps spot by spot in that the
amount of applied adhesive tends to be irregular from bead to bead,
in some beads short and others excessive. When the amount is short,
it results in poor bond between the flaps. When it is excessive, it
causes smearing and stains the packages. What is worse, smeared
adhesive causes the packages to stick to other objects. Therefore,
constant care must be taken to check the condition or quality of
beads on the flaps of packages.In order to monitor, a photoelectric switch is proposed for
being placed along the operation line to find any poor or improper
beads. However, the monitoring results are subject to 
photoelectricity whose intensity depends upon the nature and
quality of the cardboard of which the packages are made,
thereby failing to obtain precise data. As an alternative, a
monitor camera is proposed whereby the condition of beads is
visually inspected through a picture. However, the picture is
not always clear, and in order to effect precise inspection,
an expensive detector must be additionally equipped. Thus the
cost is increased.Another monitoring methods disclosed the Japanese
Publication (allowed) No. 4-51415, which is designed to find a
defective bead by reference to temperatures of the beads.
More specifically, it is ascertained whether or not each bead
has adhesive and how many beads are formed, by counting
signals from an infrared sensor for sensing the temperatures
of the beads. However, this method is only to check the
presence of adhesive in each spot but cannot inspect the
condition or quality of adhesive application in each spot.EP-A-0275334 discloses use of an infrared sensor to
monitor energy radiant from a heated adhesive bead dispensed
onto a substrate. EP-A-0275334 simply measures the output or
amplified output of the infrared sensor. EP-A-0275334
requires a chopper or a keying pulse generated by a pulse
conditioning circuit using pulses from a gun pulse
