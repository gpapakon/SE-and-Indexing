<ABSTRACT>
Novel prodrugs or depot derivatives of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-acridinamine 
of formula I 


are described, as well as methods for the preparation and 
pharmaceutical compositions of same, which are useful as 

analgesic agents for the treatment of pain, as sleep aids and 
as agents for treating the symptoms of senile dementia, 

Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, 
hyperkinesia, mania, or similar conditions of cerebral 

insufficiency characterized by decreased cerebral 
acetylcholine production or release.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
derivatives of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-acridinamine
useful as pharmaceutical agents, to methods for their
production, to pharmaceutical compositions which
include these compounds and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier, and to their use for the preparation of
pharmaceutical compositions for treating the symptoms of
cognitive decline in elderly patients.More particularly, the novel compounds of
the present invention are derivatives of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-acridinamine
which are useful in treating the
above symptoms.Disorders of cognition are generally
characterized by symptoms of forgetfulness,
confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits and/or,
in some cases, affective disturbances. These
symptoms may arise as a result of the general aging
process and/or from organic brain disease,
cerebrovascular disease, head injury or developmental
or genetic defects.The general decrease in cognitive function which
accompanies the aging process is well accepted. The
same phenomenon has been observed and documented in
many lower mammals, including those routinely
employed in pharmacological testing programs for
screening and predicting usefulness for particular
drugs in higher animals, including humans.Although disorders of cognition often accompany
the general aging process, presenile and senile
primary degenerative dementia are the most common
accepted causes of mental deterioration in the 
elderly. It has been estimated that at least
ten percent of persons over sixty years of age will
eventually suffer severe mental deterioration. A
much larger number will experience cognitive decline
of sufficient severity to impede their activities.Many of the symptoms of cognitive disorders,
especially impaired memory, are associated with
decreased acetylcholine synthesis and the impairment
of cholinoreceptive neurons. In the hippocampus and
cerebral cortex of patients suffering from primary
degenerative dementia for example, the level of the
enzyme choline acetyltransferase (CAT) can be reduced
as much as ninety percent (see Davies, P., et al,
The Lancet, 2, page 1403 (1976); Perry, E. K., et al,
Journal of Neurological Sciences, 34, pages 247 to 265
(1977); and white, P., et al, The Lancet, 1,
pages 668 to 670 (1977)).Since CAT catalyzes the synthesis of
acetylcholine from its precursors choline and acetyl
coenzyme A, the loss of CAT reflects the loss of
cholinergic or acetylcholine-releasing nerve endings
in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. There is
abundant evidence that cholinergic
