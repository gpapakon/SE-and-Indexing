<ABSTRACT>
The method of producing a binder resin has the steps 
of blending in advance (a) a starting material monomer 

mixture for two polymerization reaction types, (b) a 
compound which can react with both of starting material 

monomers for the two polymerization reaction types, and 
(c) a trica
rboxylic or higher polycarboxylic acid or a 
derivative thereof, the two polymerization reaction types 

having independent reaction paths to each other in one 
reaction vessel; and concurrently carrying out the two 

polymerization reactions in one reaction vessel to give 
the binder resin. According to the present invention, the 

binder resin which has an excellent environmental 
stability in the tribo electric charge and the image 

quality, and also has good pulverizability and 
transparency can be produced. Moreover, in a fixing 

method using a heat roller, fixing at a low temperature 
can be performed without using an offset inhibiting 

liquid. By using such a binder resin, a toner for 
electrophotography and a developer having excellent 

performance can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
a binder resin having an excellent environmental stability
with respect to the tribo electric charge and the image
quality, and it also relates to a toner for
electrophotography using such a binder resin.As described in US-A-2,297,691 and US-A-2,357,809
and other publications, conventional
electrophotography comprises the steps of forming an
electrostatic latent image by evenly charging a
photoconductive insulating layer and subsequently exposing
the layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion
and visualizing the formed image by adhering colored
charged fine powder known as a toner to the latent image
(a developing process); transferring the obtained visible
image to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper
(a transfer process); and permanently fixing the
transferred image by heating, pressure application or
other appropriate means of fixing (a fixing process).Therefore, a toner must meet the requirements not
only in the development process but also in the transfer 
process and fixing process.Generally, a toner undergoes mechanical frictional
forces due to shear force and impact force during the
mechanical operation in a developer device, thereby
deteriorating after copying from several thousands to
several ten thousands of sheets. Such deterioration of
the toner can be prevented by using a tough resin having
such a high molecular weight that it can withstand the
above mechanical friction. However, this kind of a resin
generally has such a high softening point that the
resulting toner cannot be sufficiently fixed by a
non-contact method such as oven fixing or radiant fixing
with infrared rays, because of its poor thermal
efficiency. Further, when the toner is fixed by a contact
fixing method such as a heat roller fixing method, which
is excellent in thermal efficiency and therefore widely
used, it becomes necessary to raise the temperature of the
heat roller in order to achieve sufficient fixing of the
toner, which brings about such disadvantages as
deterioration of the fixing device, curling of paper and
an increase in energy consumption. Furthermore, the resin
described above is poor in pulverizability, thereby
remarkably lowering the production efficiency of the toner
upon the production of the toner. Accordingly, the binder
resin having too increased degree of polymerization and
also too high softening point cannot be used.Meanwhile, according to the heat roller fixing 
method, the surface of a heat roller contacts the
