of the compound of formula (I), as defined above, and to a
herbicidal composition containing the compound of fomrula (I) as
an active ingredient.In the prior art, it has been well known that 2-phenoxypyrimidine
or (pyrimidin-2-yl)oxybenzene derivatives are useful as a
herbicide (see Agr. Biol. Chem., Vol. 30, P.896 (1966); Japanese
Laid-open Patent Publication No. 79-55729; U.S. Patent Specification
Nos. 4,248,619 and 4,427,437). Recently, it has also been
noted that among numerous compounds developed on the basis of 2-phenoxypyrimidine 
a 2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)oxybenzoic acid derivative
has an excellent herbicidal activity (see European Patent Publication
Nos. 223,406, 249,708, 287,072, 287,079, 315,889, 321,846,
330,990, 335,409, 346,789, 363,040, 402,751, 435,170, 435,186,
457,505, 459,243 and 468,690, British Patent Publication No.
2,237,570 and German Patent Publication No. 3942476). Those
prior known compounds show a mechanism of action similar to that
of sulfonylurea derivatives, imidazolinol derivatives and triazolepyrimidine
derivatives which have been known as an inhibitor
