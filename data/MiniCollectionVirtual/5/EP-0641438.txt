<ABSTRACT>
Methods for quantitating the biological levels of various pharmaceuticals, particularly carbohydrate pharmaceuticals, are provided for. The methods include the step of fluorescently labeling the pharmaceutical present in a sample for analysis. The fluorescently labeled pharmaceutical may then be quantitated based on measurements of fluorescence. Additionally the fluorescently labeled pharmaceuticals may be separated from other compounds in the sample by electrophoresis. Quantitation of biological levels of pharmaceuticals is used to determine optimum dosage of pharmaceuticals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUOROPHORE - ASSISTED THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORINGField of the InventionThe subject invention is in the field of biological and chemical assays, in particular the measurement of levels therapeutic agents in the body.Background of the Invention Chemicals have been used in the treatment of disease for thousand of years. With the advent of the modern pharmaceutical era, therapeutic chemicals have been administered in measured doses.The biologically available levels of a pharmaceutical may vary unpredictably in accordance with a number of factors including, clearance by the kidneys, binding to various serum components, rate of absorption into the body, breakdown rate, biological activity of the breakdown products, and the like. In the last decade, it has become apparent that in order to minimize toxic effects, and maximize therapeutic effects, one must accurately measure levels of pharmacologically active chemicals. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is currently performed for more than two dozen pharmaceutical treatments. Assays on a number of pharmaceutical chemicals are available; the total number of pharmaceutical chemical assays currently available is nearly 100.Carbohydrates are increasingly recognized as important pharmaceutical agents. Convenient assays to measure the levels of carbohydrates and similar biologicals are not readily available. In most instances the analysis of such compounds is possible only with techniques employing advanced instrumentation, such as mass spectroscopy and NMR 

 spectrometry. Furthermore, for some drugs, such as the anticoagulant carbohydrate drug "heparin", assays are difficult to develop because the drug is a mixture of biochemical components.Heparin is a mixture of acidic polysaccharides derived from the proteolytic or autolytic digestion of animal connective tissue or mucosa (skin, gut, lung, or heart) ; for a review of heparin and its uses see Ofosu, et al. , Annals of the N.Y. Acad. Sci.. Vol. 556 (June 7, 1989) . Heparin is assayed only on the basis of its ability to inhibit blood coagulation protein reactions. Heparin assays are typically performed by either measuring whole blood clotting times or activated clotting assays (see for example, Williams, et al.. HematoloÏƒy. pgs. 1256-1263, McGraw- Hill publishers (1972)) or in a research setting by measuring the activity of a specific clotting protease called anti-thrombin - III (Ofosu, et al., article by Shore, et al., ibid, pgs. 75-80).Even when standard clotting tests are used as measurements of anticoagulant
