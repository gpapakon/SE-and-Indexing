Fire arm having 

a) a barrel group (2, 18, 36, 54) which is mounted 
on or in a frame or housing (12) movable 

essentially in or counter to the direction of 
firing between a forward end limit stop (50) and 

a rearward end limit stop (48), 
b) a breech section (6, 32) which is movable - 
essentially in the same direction as the barrel 

group (2, 18, 36, 54) - between a forward closed 
position and a rearward open position, it moving 

from its closed position against the action of a 
breech-closing spring arrangement (16) into its 

open position and at the end of its recoil 
movement striking against the frame, housing (12) 

or a member (64; 64') supported against the same, 
and 
c) a buffer spring arrangement (66) which biases the 
barrel group (2, 18, 36, 54) in the direction of 

the forward end limit stop (50) and buffers its 
run against the rearward end limit stop (48), 
 
characterised in that
 
d) the spring characteristics of the breech-closing 

spring arrangement (16) and of the buffer spring 
arrangement (66) are so matched to one another 

that when the fire arm is fired 

the striking of the breech section (6) 
against the frame, the housing (12) or the 

member (64; 64') supported against it and 
the run up of the barrel group (2, 18, 36, 
54) against the forward end limit stop (50) 
 
take place simultaneously in such a way that the 

impetus exercised when the breech section makes 
impact is reduced by the impetus exercised when 

the barrel group makes impact.  
 
Fire arm according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
in its closed position the breech section (6, 32) is 

locked with the barrel group (2, 18, 36, 54). 
Fire arm according to Claim 1 or 2, the fire arm being 
constructed as a self-loading weapon and having for 

this purpose a reloading mechanism driven by the 
breech section (6, 32), characterised in that the 

breech-closing spring arrangement (16) and the buffer 
spring arrangement (66) are matched to one another 

taking account of the effect of the reloading 
mechanism on the movement of the breech section (6, 

32). 
Fire arm according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the frame, the housing (12) or 

the member (64; 64') supported against the same 
consist preferably largely of plastic or fibre-reinforced 

plastic. 
Fire arm according to Claim 2 or one of the preceding 
claims referring back to Claim 2, the fire arm being 

constructed as a hand-held weapon and having the 
following characteristics: 


a) the frame or the housing is constructed as a grip 
(12) having a magazine well; 
b) the recoil movement path of the breech part (6) 
of the breech section is arranged above the upper 

end of the magazine well, 
c) the breech part (6) and the barrel group (2, 18, 
36, 54) capable of being locked to it make the 

initial phase of the recoil movement together and 
are locked to one another until the recoil  

 
movement of the barrel group (2, 18, 36, 54) 

terminates at the rearward end limit stop (44, 
48); and 
d) arranged on the barrel (2) contained in the 
barrel group (2, 18, 36, 54) is a barrel 

attachment piece (18) which in the initial phase 
of the recoil movement engages in a barrel limit 

stop (54) which for its part is supported through 
the buffer spring (66) on the grip (12). 
Fire arm according to Claim 5, characterised in that 

a) the barrel (2) is mounted pivotably in the breech 
section (6, 32), 


a1) the front section of the barrel being supported 
by the end (32) of the breech section (6, 32) on 

the muzzle side, and 
a2) the rearward section of the barrel (8) being 
lowerable when running up against the barrel 

limit stop (54), and 
b) the barrel attachment piece (18) and the barrel 
limit stop (54) have elements of a cam control 

which are complementary to one another and under 
the action of which the barrel (2) is guided out 

of its locking engagement with the breech part 
(6) and later guided back into the latter,
 
b1) the barrel attachment piece (18) and the barrel 

limit stop (54) being engaged with one another 
transmitting motion in both directions as long as 

the breech part (6) and the barrel (2) are 
unlocked. 
Fire arm according to Claim 6, characterised in that 

a) the breech-closing spring arrangement (16) has a 
coil spring (16) which 


a1) is seated on a spring guide pin (36) under the 

barrel (2) essentially parallel to the latter,  
 

and 
a2) is supported by its front end on the end (32) of 
the breech section (6) on the muzzle side and by 

its rearward end on the grip (12); 
b) the barrel limit stop (54) is constructed at the 
rearward end of the spring guide pin (36); and 
c) the spring guide pin (36) is arranged in 
longitudinally movable manner against the effect 

of the buffer spring (66). 
Fire arm according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
the buffer spring (66) is seated inside the breech-closing 

spring (16) on the spring guide pin (36) and 
is supported by its front end on a projecting part 

(64; 64') of the spring guide pin (36) and by its 
rearward end jointly with the breech-closing spring 

(16) on the grip (12). 
Fire arm according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the projecting part is constructed as a bush (64; 64') 

the front end of which forms the rearward end limit 
stop for the breech member (6) supported (66) against 

the frame or the housing (12). 
Fire arm according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the bush (64) is arranged on the spring guide pin (36) 

to be displaceable by a limited range of movement such 
that in its rest position it is pushed forward by the 

buffer spring (66). 
Fire arm according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
in the spring guide pin (36) an oblong hole (60) is 

constructed which is penetrated by a transversely 
extending stud bolt (62) which is anchored in the bush 

(64) preferably in releasable manner preferably on 
both sides of the spring guide pin (36).  

 
Fire arm according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the bush (64') is rigidly connected to the spring 

guide pin (36).
