<ABSTRACT>
New intraocular lenses and methods for producing such lenses are disclosed. In one embodiment, the intraocular lens comprises an optic, and at least one fixation member, e.g., haptic, secured to and extending from the optic, the fixation member being made from a compressed item having a compressed thickness and comprising a polymer selected from the group consisting of methyl methacrylate homopolymers, methyl methacrylate-containing copolymers and mixtures thereof, the compressed item being derived by subjecting an item having a thickness to compression, preferably along an axis substantially parallel to the thickness, to reduce the thickness, provided that the compressed item has increased tensile strength relative to the item and is substantially no less intraocular lens manufacturable than is the item.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intraocular
lenses and to methods for making such lenses. More
particularly, the present invention relates to
intraocular lenses having one or more enhanced
physical properties, for example, tensile strength
and/or flexibility, which benefit the lenses.The use of intraocular lenses (IOLs) to improve
vision and/or to replace damaged or diseased natural
lenses in human eyes, particularly natural lenses
impaired by cataracts, has achieved wide acceptance.
Accordingly, a variety of IOLs has been developed for
surgical implantation in the posterior or anterior
chambers of the eye according to a patient's needs.Known IOLs comprise an optical lens portion or
optic which includes an optical zone, and one or
more, preferably two, supporting structures, called
fixation members or haptics, which are secured to and
extend from the optic and are for contacting eye
tissue to fix or hold the IOL in the proper position
after implantation. The optic and the fixation
member or members may each comprise a material such
as a homopolymer of methyl methacrylate or
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or a copolymer
containing methyl methacrylate. The entire IOL, that
is the optic and the fixation member or members, may
be made of a single piece or item of material, for
example, PMMA.In order to obtain a high degree of performance,
the IOL should be made of a material or materials
which have good physical or mechanical properties.
For example, the fixation member or members should
have sufficient tensile strength, flexibility and 
fatigue resistance so as not to break or separate
from the optic during IOL implantation and to be
effective in long term use in the eye. Certain
materials, in particular, the methyl methacrylate-containing
polymers noted above, have certain
properties, such as optical clarity and
biocompatibility, which make them very useful in
IOLs. However, it would be advantageous to enhance
certain other physical properties, as noted above, of
such materials to further benefit IOLs made at least
in part from such materials. This physical property
enhancement would be all the more beneficial if it
could be accomplished without the need for any
substantial or significant change or changes (other
than the enhancement itself) in the manner in which
IOLs are produced.European Patent Publication No. 0438043A2
discloses IOLs made from PMMA which is subjected to
stretching along at least two mutually angulated axes
to increase the material's dimension along the axes
of stretch by 20% to 65%,

An intraocular lens comprising:

an optic;
at least one fixation member secured to and extending
from said optic, wherein at least the fixation member is

made from a compressed item having a compressed thickness,
said compressed item being derived by subjecting an item

having a thickness to compression to reduce said thickness;
the said compressed item comprising a polymer selected from
the group consisting of methyl methacrylate homopolymers,

methyl methacrylate-containing copolymers and mixtures
thereof, provided that said compressed item has an

increased tensile strength relative to the item before said
compression.
An intraocular lens according to claim 1 wherein the optic
and the fixation member are both made from a compressed

item having a compressed thickness.
An intraocular lens according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein

the compressed item has been subjected to compression along
a single axis substantially parallel to said thickness.
An intraocular lens according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein the item has been subjected to compression

at a temperature in the range from 80 degrees C to 130
degrees C. 
An intraocular lens according to claim 4 wherein the item
has been subjected to compression at a temperature in the

range 80 degrees C to 125 degrees C.
An intraocular lens according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the optic and fixation member are both formed from

a single compressed item and the intraocular lens is the
only intraocular lens formed from the single compressed

item.
An intraocular lens according to claim 1 having two of said
fixation members, each of which has a very small cross

section and a free end away from said optic so that the
overall size of said intraocular lens between said free

ends of said fixation members is in the range from 9mm to
14mm.
An intraocular lens according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein subjecting the item to compression has

resulted in substantially no additional polymerization or
curing of said polymer.
An intraocular lens according to any on of the preceding
claims wherein the thickness of the compressed item after

compression is reduced by an amount of 30% or less.
An intraocular lens according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein the thickness of the item after compression 

is reduced by an amount in the range from 3% to 30%
relative to the uncompressed Item.
An intraocular lens according to claim 10 wherein the
thickness of the item after compression is reduced by an

amount In the range from 5% to 25% relative to the
uncompressed item.
A method of producing an intraocular lens as defined in any
one of the preceding claims; which method comprises

compressing an item and forming an intraocular lens from
the compressed item.
