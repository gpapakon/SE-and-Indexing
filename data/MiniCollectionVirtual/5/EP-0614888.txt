[b]indole-3-methanamine and -ethanamine compounds as antidepressants. The present invention provides compounds having Formula I depicted 
below, 
 
where, 
R1 is H, (C1-C6)alkyl, aryl(C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C5)alkylcarbonyl; R2 is H, (C1-C6)alkyl, aryl, aryl(C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C6)alkylcarbonyl; R3 is H or (C1-C6)alkyl; and R4 is H; m is an integer of 1 or 2; n is an integer of 0, 1 or 2; and X is (C1-C6)alkyl, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, (C1-C6)alkoxy, aryl(C1-C6)alkoxy, 
hydroxy, 
 
amino, (C1-C6)alkylamino, di(C1-C6)alkylamino, 
(C1-C6)alkylcarbonylamino or (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonylamino, wherein R5 is H or 
(C1-C6)alkyl; and R6 is H or (C1-C6)alkyl, aryl(C1-C6)alkyl or aryl;  
 
or alternatively the group -NR5R6 as a whole is 
 
R7 being hydrogen or 
(C1-C6)alkyl; and the dotted line in the formula means an optional double bond; 
which compounds show activities as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor demonstrating a 
utility for the treatment of depression, and activities as a cholinesterase inhibitor 
demonstrating a utility for the treatment of various memory dysfunctions such as 
Alzheimer's disease. Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the following definitions shall apply 
throughout the specification and the appended claims. The term loweralkyl or (C1-C6)alkyl shall mean a straight or branched alkyl 
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of said lower- or (C1-C6)alkyl 
include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl and straight- 
and branched-chain pentyl and hexyl. The term aryl in each occurrence shall mean a phenyl group optionally 
mono-substituted with a loweralkyl, loweralkoxy, halogen, nitro or trifluoromethyl 
group. The term halogen shall mean fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The dotted lines appearing in various structural formulas in this specification 
and the appended claims shall mean an optional double bond. Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical 
formula or name shall encompass all geometric, stereo, optical and tautomeric 
isomers where such isomers exist. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by utilizing one or more of 
the synthetic steps described below.  
 Throughout the description of the synthetic steps, the notations X, m, n and R1 
through R7 shall have the respective meanings
