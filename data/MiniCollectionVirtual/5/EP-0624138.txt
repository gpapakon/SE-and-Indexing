<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to dispensing closures
having lids that are joined to the closure body by a resilient
hinge, such "living" hinge being temporarily deformed by
interacting camming surfaces that urge the lid to move between
an opened, and a closed, position. More particularly, the
invention pertains to a flexible holder for the "living" hinge
of a dispensing closure; such holder facilitates the movement of
the lid between its two stable states, i.e. opened and closed.Molded plastic dispensing closures, that can be molded
at high production rates and with close tolerances, have met with
widespread commercial acceptance for dispensing products too
numerous to categorize or list. Known dispensing closures
usually include (1) a closure body that is secured to the neck
of the container holding the product to be dispensed or discharged,
(2) a lid that can be pivoted between an open, or
discharging position, and a closed position, and (3) a resilient
formed hinge joining the lid to the closure body. Such resilient,
or "living" hinge may be integrally molded with the lid and
closure body, and such "living" hinge enables the lid to be
pivoted relative to the closure for the life expectancy of the
closure. It should be noted that the "living" hinges are but a
few thousandths of an inch in thickness, and are subjected to
significant stressing and/or operating forces.In order to properly stress the "living" hinge as the
lid is pivoted between its opened and closed positions, diverse
camming mechanisms have been utilized. For example, as shown in
U.S. Patent 4,220,248, granted September 2, 1980, to Woodrow S.
Wilson and Robert E. Hazard, upstanding resilient posts (50)
project upwardly from an upper surface (28) of the closure body
and coact with cams, or camming surfaces (52) defined at the
lower edge of the skirt (44) of the lid (14). The cams contact,
and deform, the resilient posts during movement of the lid, and
enhance the successful operation of "living" hinge (16) by 
temporarily deforming same, within its elastic limits, as the lid
is urged between its opened, and closed, position.A similar camming action is achieved by cooperating,
dissimilarly oriented posts or tabs situated on the top surface
of the closure body and the underside of the lid, as shown in
U.S. Patent 4,158,902, granted in June 1979 to Milton Chernack
et al.Another dispensing closure of particular interest is
shown in U.S. Patent 4,377,247, granted March 22, 1983 to Robert
E. Hazard and Woodrow S. Wilson. The dispensing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dispensing closure member (100) of plastics material, comprising: a body
(102) adapted to be secured to the mouth of a container for material to be

dispensed; a lid (104); a hinge (106) integral with both the body and the lid, the lid
being movable about the hinge between an open and a closed position with respect

to the body; a flexible post (120) integral with the hinge and with the body and
having the hinge at its outer end, the post extending in line with, and spaced from, a

thrust surface, and a rigid post (118) projecting from the lid and intended to come
into camming engagement with the thrust surface as the lid pivots about the outer

end of the flexible post, the length of the rigid post being greater than the distance
between the top of the flexible post and the thrust surface, whereby rotation of the lid

about the body causes the end of the rigid post to contact the thrust surface to cause
the flexible post to flex away from the thrust surface,

characterised in that

the flexible post (120, 220) may be integral with either the body or the lid, with
the rigid post (118, 214) extending from the lid or body, respectively;
a buttress (114, 218) projects outwardly from the body or lid to provide a
surface that extends transversely to the plane of contact between the body and lid to

form, or act as a continuation of, the thrust surface, and
the hinge lies substantially in the plane of contact of the lid and body;
A closure member as claimed in claim 1, in which, when the lid is in its closed
position, the buttress is accommodated wholly within the envelope of the closure.
A closure member as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the flexible post (220)
is integral with the lid; in which the buttress (218) extends from the lid, and in which

the rigid post (214) extends from the body. 
A closure member as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the end of the
rigid post (118, 214) is flat, and in which the length of the rigid post is such that,

when its flat end rests against the thrust surface, the lid extends substantially at a
right angle to the plane of the top of the body.
