<ABSTRACT>
An interactive image display device comprises cursor control means 
which, realise the movement of a cursor in a direction of a first and a second coordinate 

axis on the screen, respectively, in dependence on whether a control knob is rotated 
counter-clockwise or clockwise in order to change an adjustment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an interactive image display device, comprising a
display screen and cursor control means for controlling a movement of a cursor on the
screen.A device of this kind is known from United States Patent Specification
No. 4,764,763. The control means described in the cited publication comprise two
rotatable knobs, one for controlling horizontal cursor movements and one for
controlling vertical cursor movements. Also known are devices in which the cursor is
controlled by means of a mouse. Two-dimensional movements of the mouse are then
converted into two-dimensional movements of the cursor.Interactive image display devices can be used, for example in a car to
indicate locations on a map displayed on the screen. The driver of the car indicates a
location on the map by moving the cursor to the corresponding location on the screen.The known control means require two adjustment freedoms (two knobs in
the case of the cited publication or a two-dimensionally movable mouse). For a variety
of applications, for example for application in a car, however, it is desirable to realise
two-dimensional cursor control while requiring a minimum of adjustment freedoms.It is inter alia an object of the invention to provide an interactive image
display device in which the number of adjustment freedoms required for two-dimensional
control of cursor movements is reduced.To achieve this, the interactive image display device in accordance with
the invention is characterized in that the cursor control means are arranged to realise the
movement of the cursor in a direction of a first or a second coordinate axis on the
screen, depending on whether a change of adjustment of a control means has a first
direction or an opposing second direction. The cursor position can thus be adjusted on a
two-dimensional part of the screen while utilizing only one adjustment freedom in the
control means.An embodiment of the image display device in accordance with the
invention is characterized in that the directions of the first and the second coordinate 
axis intersect at an angle of substantially 90 degrees. These cursor movements can be
readily executed and are clear to the user. Different directions can be used for the
coordinate axes in different locations on the screen.An embodiment of the image display device in accordance with the
invention is characterized in that the control means comprises a rotatable knob which is
rotatable in mutually opposed directions for adjustment. A rotatable knob is particularly
suitable for

<CLAIMS>
An interactive image display device, comprising a display screen (30) and

cursor control means (40) for controlling a movement of the cursor on the screen,
characterized in that the cursor control means are arranged to realise the movement of

the cursor in a direction of a first (16) or a second (17) coordinate axis on the screen, depending
on whether a change of adjustment of the control means has a first direction (43) or an

opposing second direction (45).
An interactive image display device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized
in that the directions of the first and the second coordinate axis intersect at an angle of

substantially 90 degrees.
An interactive image display device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the control means comprises a rotatable knob which is rotatable in

mutually opposed directions for adjustment.
An interactive image display device as claimed in Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that, viewed from the normal position of use, counter-clockwise and

clockwise rotations of the knob correspond to movements of the cursor in the
downwards direction and to the right, respectively.
An interactive image display device as claimed in Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4,
characterized in that it is arranged to move the cursor, when it reaches a first point of

intersection with a first boundary of a predetermined region on the screen during
movement, to a second, other point of intersection on an opposite second boundary.
An interactive image display device as claimed in Claim 5, characterized
in that the second point of intersection is chosen so that the movement of the cursor is

cyclical.
An interactive image display device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the cursor control means are arranged to display the cursor as

a pair of intersecting hairlines, the hairlines extending along respective paths which are
followed by the cursor in response to a continued change of the adjustment with the first

sign and the second sign, respectively.
