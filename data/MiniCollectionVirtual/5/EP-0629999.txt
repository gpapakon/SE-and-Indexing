<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic tape (21) has three evenly spaced-apart longitudinally-extending servo track areas 
(40-42). Four equal-sized longitudinally-extending data track areas (45-48) are disposed between 

said servo track areas (40-42) and between longitudinal edges of the tape (21) and one of said data 
track areas (45-48). All servo track areas (40-42) are simultaneously sensed for producing one head 

positioning signal (100). Data tracks are arranged into four groups of tracks (45-48), one-half of the 
data tracks in each group are concurrently accessed. The data tracks on the tape are arranged in 

clusters. Each cluster has one track from each of the groups of tracks. Two laterally-adjacent track 
clusters constitute four data track wraps for serpentine scanning of data tracks. The concurrent track 

accessing respectively occurs in first and second halves of a data track wrap. Each servo area 
indicates two lateral positions of the tape to the head (27). The lateral spacing between the lateral 

positions is equal to about a data track width. This arrangement makes the servo areas field writable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic tape data storage particularly magnetic tape having a
plurality of spaced apart servo track areas and capable of having a diverse number of concurrently
accessed data tracks.Recording data or other information-bearing signals on magnetic tape has been practiced for
many years. Some of the track formats on magnetic tape facilitate a so-called serpentine scanning
of the tape such that the logical beginning and end of the magnetic tape are at the same physical end
of the tape. In a preferred form of the invention, it is desired to employ serpentine scanning of data
tracks while providing a close control of head-to-tape lateral positioning.Such control of head-to-tape lateral positioning is best achieved by servoing the head position
laterally to the tape. It is also desired, particularly in view of possible high error rates in magnetic tape,
to provide a reliable set of servo tracks on a magnetic tape. In combination with the last-mentioned
desire, it is also desired to control costs by making the head as low cost as possible. Such desire can
be achieved using the present invention by placement arid selection of servo track areas on the tape.Most magnetic tape systems employ heads that are capable of scanning a fixed number of data
tracks on a tape. Using the number of gaps in the head and the number of tracks on the tape are fixed
with respect to each other. It is desired to provide a tape format and head construction that enables
varying the number of active gaps in a head while using the same format on the tape. It is also desired
to have servo track areas that are amenable to such variation in the number of tracks to be concurrently
accessed.An important aspect of magnetic tape recording is the ever increasing areal data storage density.
It is desired to provide servo track areas that tend to minimize reduction of the data storage capacity
of a magnetic tape through the introduction of servo position signals into the tape.It is also desired to provide servo tracks that can be recorded by a tape device in the field, i.e.
in situ.Most prior art magnetic tapes having longitudinally extending tracks do not employ servo tracks
on the tape. While the so-called slant track tapes, video for example, employ servo tracks, such servo
tracks are for synchronizing a rotating head to the tape motion and slant track position. As seen in US
patent 4,224,643 by Nakano et al and in US patent 4,760,475 by Wong et al, the servo tracks are at the
longitudinal edges of the video
