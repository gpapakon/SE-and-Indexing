<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes a process for the production, in one step, of tert-alkyl ethers of glycerol from an olefin and glycerol in the presence of an acidic zeolite catalyst with wide pores, possessing three-dimensional networks of intersecting channels and in which the Si/Al atomic ratio is greater than 5.

Process for the production of tertiary alkyl glycerol
ethers, said process comprising:


providision of a hydrocarbonated charge comprising one
or more olefins branched on the double bond, having 4 to 12

carbon atoms, glycerol and a zeolite used in acid form and
having the following characteristics:


an atomic ratio of Si/Al greater than 5
pores with an aperture size greater than 0.7 nm
three-dimensional networks of crossed channels
bringing into contact the hydrocarbonated charge and
the glycerol with the catalytic solid in effective

conditions for forming ethers, which conditions comprising:

a) a pressure from 0.3 to 7 MPa
b) a temperature from 50° to 200°C
c) a molar ratio of olefin to glycerol in the range of
between 6:1 and 1:1
d) a gravimetric ratio of catalyst to glycerol in the
range of between 0.01 and 10%
recovery of the tertiary alkyl ethers.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
zeolite has an atomic ratio of Si/Al in the range of

between 8.5 and 40, preferably approximately 28.
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the zeolite is an ultrastable Y zeolite.
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the zeolite is a β zeolite.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the zeolite has a cellular unit parameter in the range

of between 2.425 and 2.450 nm. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the olefin is isobutylene.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that etherification is achieved at pressures of 0.6 to 2.1

MPa.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the molar ratio of olefin to glycerol is in the range

of between 5:1 and 1:1.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in
that etherification is achieved at a temperature of 80° to

120°C.
