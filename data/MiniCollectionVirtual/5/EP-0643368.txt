<ABSTRACT>
An object movement estimator (400) predicts optical 
flow by estimating changes in sensed images using 

one-dimensional correlations. Sensed image portions are 
stored at a first instant of time and compared with 

sensed image portions at a second instant of time. An 
optimal flow is estimated by performing a one-dimensional 

correlation of the sensed image portions at the first and 
second instants of time, and a time-to-contact is 

estimated based on the predicted optical flow thus 
obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to optical 
perception using artificial intelligence, and 
specifically to an improved system and method for 
estimating the movement between objects using optical 
flow measurements. Numerous schemes have been proposed to predict the 
movement of objects relative to one another for 
navigational and other purposes. Acoustic echoing, for 
instance, provides an established method of determining 
the range from one object to another. If one object is 
approaching another, such ranging measurements can be 
used to estimate a time-to-contact. In an environment where optical images of an object 
are available, a number of techniques have been proposed 
to model common biological correlation mechanisms for 
sensing image expansion, rotation, and translation. In 
such techniques, portions of an image at a first instant 
of time are compared with portions of the image at a  
 
second instant of time, to determine an optical "flow" 
over time. Correlation techniques are typically used to 
predict the actual flow, and other established algorithms 
are used to determine whether the flow suggests a change 
in distance to the object, translational movement 
relative to the object, or rotational movement of the 
object. Use of such models to predict when an observer and 
another object will contact one another is particularly 
useful. Industrial robots, intelligent highway vehicles, 
and numerous other devices could be improved by being 
able to predict contact with other objects. U.S. Patent 
No. 5,128,874 teaches an obstacle detection system using 
a combination of binocular stereo vision and laser radar 
ranging. U.S. Patent No. 4,905,151 teaches a mobile robot 
vision system in which a one-dimensional image is 
processed in conjunction with "a priori" information 
about robot velocity to yield optical flow information 
used to determine distance to an object. One technique for implementing movement detectors is 
discussed in Poggio et al., "Green Theorems and 
Qualitative Properties of the Optical Flow",
