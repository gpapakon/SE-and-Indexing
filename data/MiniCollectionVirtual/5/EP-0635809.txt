<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for indicating the thickness of a document 
being fed along a feed path comprises cooperating upper and 

lower roll means (20 and 32) between which a document 
passes, the upper roll means (32) being movable towards and 

away from the lower roll means (20). A further roll (46) is 
mounted so as normally to be spaced a short distance from 

the upper roll means (32). A pulse generating device 
(52,58) is coupled to the further roll (46) and generates 

pulses as the further roll (46) rotates. If a document of 
more than a predetermined thickness passes between the two 

roll means (20 and 32), the upper roll means (32) is moved 
upwardly and engages the further roll (46) to rotate the 

further roll (46). This causes pulses to be generated, 
indicating a document in excess of said predetermined 

thickness. The pulses are counted, enabling the apparatus 
to distinguish between a crease and an entire document in 

excess of said predetermined thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
detecting the thickness of record media in a feed path, and
more particularly relates to such an apparatus in which the
thickness of a record medium is measured during passage of
the record medium along a feed path between record medium
drive means (which may be formed by drive belts or rolls)
and cooperating roll means.The apparatus which is the subject of the present
invention may be employed in a variety of applications in
which it is desired to measure the thickness of record media
as said media traverse a feed path. One such application is
in a document processing module which is employed in
automated teller machines (ATMs) widely used by financial
institutions such as banks. The module is capable of
accepting a document from a bank customer and processing it
according to its type. If a single sheet document such as a
cheque or giro form is input by the customer, it is passed
to an image processing unit along one feed path. If an
envelope (which may contain currency or cheques) is input by
the customer, it is passed to a secure bin along another
feed path.The correct feed path is selected by the customer by
keying in to the ATM customer keyboard the correct
information about the type of document. If, for example,
the customer incorrectly inserts an envelope when performing
a cheque transaction, the envelope would be passed to the
image processing unit. This envelope could be of a greater
thickness than that which the image processing unit can
handle, and the envelope might therefore become jammed in
the feed path, or could damage the image processing unit.The thickness sensing mechanism is therefore required
to ensure that documents or other record media of greater
than a given thickness are not passed into the image 
processing unit. The main requirements for such a thickness
indicating mechanism are reliability and low cost.
Displacement transducers such as an LVDT (linear variable
differential transformer) could be used, and would provide a
reliable mechanism, but are expensive to implement.From GB-A-2218524 there is known an apparatus for
detecting the thickness of sheets which are fed between a pair
of cooperating rollers, one of which is mounted on a movable
shaft. The apparatus includes pulse generating means for
generating timing pulses synchronized with rotation of the
pair of rollers, these pulses being counted by data processing
means. A further roller which forms part of a displacement
detector is urged into engagement with the movable

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for indicating the thickness of a
record medium which is passed along a feed path, including

record medium drive means (20), first roll means (32) mounted
in cooperative relationship with respect to said drive means

and movable towards and away from said drive means, means (42)
for urging said first roll means towards engagement with said

drive means, second roll means (46), a pulse generating device
(52,58) coupled to said second roll means, and means (68) for

counting pulses generated by said pulse generating device,
characterized in that said second roll means (46) is mounted

so as normally to be spaced a short distance from said first
roll means (32), whereby when a record medium is driven

between said drive means (20) and said first roll means (32),
if the record medium is of more than a predetermined thickness

said first roll means is moved into engagement with said
second roll means (46) so as to rotate said second roll means

and cause pulses to be generated by said pulse generating
device (52,58) and counted by said means (68) for counting.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that said pulse
 generating device includes a timing disc (52)
rotatable with said second roll means (46) and having a

plurality of timing elements (54,56), said pulse generating
device also including a sensor (58) arranged to sense said

timing elements and to generate a series of pulses as said
timing disc rotates.
An apparatus according to either claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that said first roll means (32) is mounted

for rotation on an arm (36) pivoted at a point remote from the
axis of rotation of said first roll means.
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by means (62,66) for restraining

rotation of said second roll means (46) except when it is
being driven by said first roll means (32). 
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding

fabricated from a compliant rubber.
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said drive means and said

element (30) when a record medium of a thickness greater
than said predetermined thickness passes between said drive

means (20) and said first roll means (32).
