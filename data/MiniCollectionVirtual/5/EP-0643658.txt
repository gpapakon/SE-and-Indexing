<ABSTRACT>
A track system for fastening at the groove (2) of a mast (1) comprising a profiled track (4) and a plurality of slide members (5). The track (4) is formed to receive cars (12) in an axially slidable manner and provided with transverse openings (17) for receiving the screws (38). The slide members (5) are adapted to be slidably arranged, however, prevented from rotating in the groove (2) and with a base (28) being engaged in the interior of the groove in the mounted state of said slide member (5) and a shaft extending through the slot (3) of the groove, and an axial threaded hole (36). The threaded hole (36) is adapted to coact with the thread (37) of a screw (38) when said thread has been inserted through the corresponding transverse opening (17) in the track (4) for fastening said track (4) to the mast (1). On the surface (34) adapted to face the groove (2) the track is provided with recesses (22) coaxially arranged with the transverse openings (17). The recesses (22) are adapted and dimensioned for receiving the protruding portion (33) of the slide members (5) in a circumscribing manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a track system to be fastened to a groove in a spar, 
preferably in the groove on the back of a mast, comprising a track formed to 
receive cars in an axially slidable manner and provided with tranverse openings 
for receiving fastening means and a plurality of slide members adapted to be 
slidably arranged, however, prevented from rotating in the groove and having a 
base being engaged in the interior of the groove in the mounted state of the slide 
member, and a shaft extending through the slot of the groove and being provided 
with an axial opening adapted to coact with the fastening means inserted through 
the corresponding transverse opening in the track. A track system is known, wherein the track is essentially U-shaped and adapted 
for mounting on the mast with the cavity facing the groove. The fastening means 
are screws being inserted through transverse openings in the track. For fastening 
the track onto mast, each individual slide member is to be slided in the groove, 
until its threaded hole is aligned with the corresponding transverse opening in the 
track, whereafter a screw is inserted through the transverse opening to engage the 
threaded hole in the slide member. This is a rather difficult and time-consuming 
operation, it is particularly difficult to bring the screw into engagement with the 
inthreaded hole. Further, said system has the drawback that the slide member 
slides downwards, until it abuts the subjacent slide member, if a screw is unscrewed 
after the track has been mounted. It is not possible to mount this slide 
member again without loosening all of the remaining slide members which have 
been used to fasten the track to the mast. This operation is often very time-consuming, 
since 200 slide members are sometimes used.  
 The object of the invention is to provide a track system of above type which is 
easier to mount on a spar having a groove than the hitherto known track systems. In order to obtain the above object the track system according to the invention is 
characterised in that it is provided with recesses arranged coaxially with the 
transverse openings on the side intended to face the groove, and that said recesses 
are adapted and dimensioned for receiving the protruding portion of the shaft of 
said slide members in a circumscribing manner. As a result, the recesses act to 
position the slide members in such a manner that the axial opening thereof is 
essentially coaxial with the transverse opening of the track, when the protruding
