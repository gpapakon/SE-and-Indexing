<ABSTRACT>
Magnetic head essentially includes at least one excitation conductor (2) situated beneath two layers (3, 4) of magnetic material constituting magnetic poles of the head and separated by a gap (5). The layout of the conductor is such that it makes an angle different from 0 and from 90 DEG  with respect to the direction of the gap. Various embodiments of the invention are provided, in particular with plural conductors so as to produce a matrix-type control. Applications: magnetic recording/reading heads.

A magnetic write/read head comprising at least one first conductor (2), two
layers of magnetic material (3, 4) situated substantially in the same plane above the

conductor, said two layers being magnetically separated by a gap element (5), said gap
element forming an angle different from 0° and different from 90° with the direction

of the conductor, and the length of the gap being substantially greater than the width
of the first conductor in such a way that the intersection of said conductor with the gap

determines the width of the information element which is written/read.

made of magnetic material (1) is situated on the side opposite the two layers of

magnetic material (3, 4) with respect to the conductor (2).
A magnetic head according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises at
least one second conductor (2') which intersects a first conductor (2) substantially at

the point of intersection of the latter with the gap (5).
A magnetic head according to claim 3, characterised in that one first conductor
and the second conductor (2, 2') are in parallel planes and extend in directions which

are symmetrical with respect to a plane normal to the direction of the gap (5).
A magnetic head according to claim 4, characterised in that each conductor (2,
2') forms an angle of 45° with the direction of the gap (5).

comprises a plurality of parallel conductors (20, 21, 22, 23).
A magnetic head according to claim 3, characterised in that the first and second
conductors comprise a plurality of first, mutually parallel conductors (20, 21, 22, 23)

and a plurality of second, mutually parallel conductors (20', 21', 22', 23'), respectively. 
A magnetic head according to claim 1, characterised in that each conductor
comprises a plural
ity of mutually parallel elementary conductors situated in a plane
parallel to the gap (5), wherein a central conductor has a defined cross-section and the

side conductors have a cross-section which is larger than said defined cross-section.
A magnetic head according to claim 1, characterised in that each conductor has
a narrow portion on both sides of the gap so as to constitute, at the gap, a conductor

zone which is substantially parallel to the gap.
A magnetic head according to claim 3, characterised in that it comprises a
plurality of first conductors (C'
1
;;;
2
) which intersect a second conductor (C
1
) in the
region of intersection of the latter with the gap.
A magnetic head according to claim 10, characterised in that the second
conductor has a width which is greater than that of each first conductor.
A magnetic head according to claim 11, characterised in that the second
conductor (C
1
) is parallel to a gap (5).
A magnetic head according to claim 3, characterised in that the second
conductor is looped to the first conductor.
