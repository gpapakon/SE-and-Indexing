<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voice signal
processing device with respect to voice detection and voice
recognition techniques.Recently, voice detection devices for detecting the
presence/absence of a voice have been widely used for
applications such as voice recognition, speaker recognition,
equipment operation by voice, and input to computer by
voice.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a prior art voice
detection device, whose configuration and operation will be
explained hereinafter. A power detection section 19 detects
a power value in an input signal to render the value to be
compared by a comparator 21, and then the comparator 21
compares the value with a predetermined set value of a
threshold setting section 20 to output a voice-detected
signal when the value is larger than the predetermined set
value.According to the prior art voice detection device as
described above, however, even if a voice input is small ,
when the input signal contains a noise other than the voice, 
a power detected by the power detection section 19 larger
than the set value of the threshold setting section 20 ,
causes the voice-detected signal to be outputted, thereby
developing an inconvenience of frequent erroneous
detections.The present invention intends to detect accurately
voice by utilizing cepstrum analysis. Cepstrum analysis has until now essentially been
used to separate spoken voiced sounds from spoken unvoiced sounds
and for pitch determination of spoken voiced sounds: see A.M. Noll:
"Cepstrum pitch determination" in the Journal of the Acoustical Society
of America, Vol.41, no.2, 1967, New York,USA, pp.293-309.A signal detection device of the present invention
comprises;
cepstrum calculating means for obtaining a cepstrum of
a voice signal,mean-value calculation means for making equal the
cepstrum output from the cepstrum calculating means;threshold setting means for setting a voice detection
threshold level on the basis of the cepstrum mean-value
output from the mean-value calculation means, andvoice detection means to which the cepstrum mean-value
output from the mean-value calculation means, the cepstrum
output from the cepstrum calculating means and the
threshold output signal from the threshold setting means
are supplied and which detects a voiceWith a configuration according to the present
invention, cepstrum calculation means calculates a cepstrum
value of an input signal to obtain the calculated signal and
a cepstrum mean-value signal by the calculated signal. Then 
a voice detection is performed on
