<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for wire electric discharge machining or an apparatus for electric discharge machining for 
engraving, the machining time of which can be controlled reliably. The apparatus has means (1) for determining actual 

machining condition including the machining speed in accordance with machining condition basic data (8) obtained 
experimentally in advance, and set data (7) inputted by the operator, means (2) for calculating the circumferential 

length L of a workpiece by use of a machining program (9), means (3) for calculating machining time in accordance 
with the machining speed included in the actual machining condition and the circumferential length L, means (4) for 

calculating the machining end time (t+T) from the present time t measured by clock means (14a) and the machining 
time T, display means (16) display the present time t on an analogue clock (63), and the machining end time (t+T) on 

an analogue clock (64). Since the present time and the machining end time are thus displayed on analogue clocks, the 
operator can recognize such information easily just by observing the screen, thus making it possible to easily control 

the machining time exactly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric discharge
apparatus such as a wire electric discharge apparatus, engraving
electric discharge apparatus and the like, and more specifically,
to an electric discharge apparatus having a function for managing
machining start time and machining end time.Since wire electric discharge apparatuses and
engraving electric discharge apparatuses can machine a raw material
which cannot be machined by usual machining and have high machining
accuracy, they are widely used. On the contrary, the electric
discharge apparatuses require long machining time and, for example,
several tens of hours are required to machine a single piece of
workpiece in not a few cases. Therefore, it is important to manage
machining start time and machining end time.For example, when machining is ended in midnight in
unmanned operation, a workpiece having been machined is left as
it is and sometimes rusted. Therefore, a time during which a
workpiece is left must be shortened after the completion of
machining. Thus the management of machining end time is important.To cope with this problem, although there is an
electric discharge apparatus in which a machining time is
previously determined by calculation and a machining end time is 
managed based on the machining time, the machining end time
is not always indicated clearly, and the management of time
accompanied with machining is a vague and time-consuming
job to the operator. Therefore, it cannot be the fact that
machining time is properly controlled.JP-A-4069133 discloses a machine tool which employs a
machining completion time calculation. JP-A-3111125
discloses an electric discharge machining time prediction
method and apparatus.Taking the above into consideration, an object of the
present invention is to provide an electric discharge
apparatus capable of properly managing machining time.To solve the above problem, according to the present
invention, there is provided an electric discharge
apparatus comprising:
actual machining condition determination means for
determining actual machining conditions including a
machining time from previously experimentally determined
fundamental machining condition data and set data;circumferential length calculation means for
calculating the circumferential length of a workpiece from
a machining program;machining time calculation means for calculating a
machining time from the machining speed and the
circumferential length; characterised by:the apparatus having a function for managing machining
time;time
