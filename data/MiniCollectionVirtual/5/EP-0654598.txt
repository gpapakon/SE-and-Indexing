<ABSTRACT>
In a bypass turbo jet engine thrust reverser including shiftable elements or doors (7), the stationary structural elements are composed of a front frame (10) arranged transversely and of a transverse rear frame (11), both connected by longitudinal spars (beams) (12a, 12b, 12c), enframing the shiftable elements (7), whose shifting means, such as jacks (7a) are fixed to the rear frame (11).

<CLAIMS>
A thrust reverser of a bypass turbojet engine comprising
movable elements (7) which in the closed position are

retracted into the outer wall of the annular bypass flow
channel and in the open position form obstacles for deflecting

the bypass flow to produce a thrust reversal, and a fixed
structural front frame (10) disposed transversely of the

geometric axis of the reverser, and longitudinal beams (12a,
12b, 12c), characterised in that the fixed structural elements

of the reverser comprise a transverse rear frame (11) in
addition to the front frame (10) and the beams, the

longitudinal beams (12a, 12b,12c) interconnecting the front
frame (10) and the rear frame (11) and co-operating with the

frames (10, 11) to frame the movable elements (7) of the
reverser, the terms "front" and "rear" corresponding to the

upstream edge and downstream edge respectively as defined
relatively to the normal flow direction in forward thrust

operation of the reverser, and in that the means (7a) for
changing the position of the movable elements (7) are secured

to the rear frame (11).
A thrust reverser according to claim 1 wherein the
position-changing means are in the form of rams and each ram

(7a), one end (14) of which is secured to the rear frame (11),
pulls on an articulation (15) disposed at its other end and

rigidly secured to the movable element, in the form of a door
(7), to move said door into its open position.
A thrust reverser according to claim 1 wherein the
position-changing-means are in the form of rams and a rod (18)

is pivotally connected to one end (15) of each ram (7a), the
other end (14) thereof being secured to the rear frame (11),

and the rod (18) is pivotally connected at its other end (17)
to the movable element, in the form of a door (7), at a 

position offset towards the inside surface of the door and
transmits the actuating forces of the ram (7a) to the door(7).
A trust reverser according to any of claims 1 to 3
wherein the means for changing the position of the movable

elements (7) are in the form of a cable drive.
A thrust reverser according to any of claims 1 to 4
wherein the movable elements are in the form of pivoting or

tilting obstacles which uncover deflecting grids.
