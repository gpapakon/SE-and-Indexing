Data transmission installation, of the type
comprising at least two data processing stations (Pa,

Pb), each provided with a network interface (Ia, Ib),
which is capable of transmitting messages on request

and of gathering messages received, as well as a
transmission/reception management device (ARC) provided

with a collision detector and a means of resolving a
collision following a recognized collision condition,

this management device issuing orders confirming
transmission or reception, characterized in that each

of the two stations includes a radio transceiver
device, with a transceiver (RD) operating on a so-called

central channel, for transmitting the messages
to be exchanged, controlled in accordance with the said

confirming orders, and an auxiliary transceiver (R1)
operating on at least one side channel, possessing a

normal state, and devised so as to modify its
transmission/reception state in response to a detected

collision.
Installation according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the network interface is devised (RC) so

as to recognize a collision in reception by violation
of a predefined criterion.
Installation according to one of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the auxiliary transceiver is

capable of fast transmission/reception switching, and
in that, in response at least to the start of an order

confirming transmission, the auxiliary transceiver (R1)
is devised so as to operate in fast alternating 

transmission/reception mode, according to a pattern
chosen so as to be specific to this

transmission/reception device, a collision being
recognized by the collision detector if a signal of

level greater than a first threshold level is received
during a substantial part of at least one silence of

this side channel, evincing concomitant transmission
from another station on the side channel.
Installation according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the pattern chosen is substantially

random.
Installation according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the collision detector (ARCA) is

an automatic handler, possessing a first step, in which
it can take a first so-called passive state and a

second so-called active state, this automatic handler
being placed in the active state upon an order

confirming transmission, whilst it is otherwise in the
passive state, in particular in response to the

recognition of a start of message reception, in that in
its active state the collision detector automatic

handler controls the auxiliary transceiver in fast
alternating transmission/reception mode according to a

chosen pattern, whilst in its passive state, it can
place this auxiliary transceiver in reception mode, and

in that the collision detector automatic handler
possesses a second step, in which it possesses a first

state for transmission on collision and at least one
other state for listening, whilst any collision

recognized during the first step forces the second step
to transmit on collision, so as to inform other

stations of the collision, and that otherwise the
automatic handler goes into listening mode.
Installation according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the first side channel is split into two

first side channels, of which one serves for the
functions of the first step, and the other for the

transmission on collision of the second step, which can
be immediate. 
Installation according to one of Claims 5 and
6, characterized in that the collision detector

automatic handler (ARCA) possesses, in its second step,
a second so-called active listening state and a third

so-called passive listening state, one or other state
being taken according to the previous state during the

first step, the active listening step ensuring
transmission intervention over the side channel, so as

to accompany any transmission on collision, so that it
exhibits predetermined characteristics.
Installation according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that each radio transceiver device is

devised so as to operate on a second side channel (R2),
on which it transmits an engaged signal so long as it

is receiving a demodulable signal on its main channel,
while the transmission of data is disabled for any

station whose radio transceiver device is receiving the
engaged signal on its second side channel.
Installation according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that, in the absence of sufficient

natural traffic, the management device is able (ARCC;
ADF) to force the transmission of artificial messages,

so as to maintain a mutual tuning of the pilot
frequencies of the various stations.
Installation according to Claim 9, characterized
in that each management device is devised so as to

carry out the said transmission of artificial messages
in a substantially random manner.
Installation according to one of Claims 9 and
10, characterized in that some at least of the

artificial messages are used for service purposes.
Installation according to Claim 11, characterized
in that some at least of the artificial messages

are used for exchanging information which is useful for
understanding the messages.
Installation according to one of Claims 11 and
12, characterized in that each management device (ARCB)

is able to instruct transmission not only upon a local

request, but also in the guise of relay of transmission 
between distant stations, and in that some at least of

the artificial messages are used for exchanging
routeing tables defining these relays of transmission.
Installation according to Claim 13,
characterized in that each management device keeps at

least one list of the stations which it is receiving,
and transmits it as an artificial message, thereby

allowing it reciprocally to keep a list of the stations
which are receiving it on the basis of the artificial

messages which it receives.
Installation according to Claim 14,
characterized in that each management device also

keeps:

a topological directory designating at least
some of the stations with which it can communicate,

directly or indirectly, and defining the pathway or
pathways of this communication, and
a routeing table defining a preferred pathway
at any given moment.
Installation according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the messages are in the

ISO standard format for the IEEE 802.3 standard,
augmented with a preliminary header.
Data transmission method, according to which:

there are at least two data processing
stations (Pa, Pb), each provided with a network

interface (Ia, Ib), which is capable of cooperating

messages on request and to gather messages received, as
well as of compiling orders confirming transmission or

reception,

transmission/reception of the data is carried out on a

so-called central radio channel (RD), controlled in
accordance with the said confirming orders, and

   in that, in response to a collision detection,
