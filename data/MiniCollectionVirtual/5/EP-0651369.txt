<ABSTRACT>
In a flute mouthpiece in which the inner 
surface of a hole (3) on this side, on which the lip is 

to be placed, is made to extend downward into a head 
pipe (1) to form, on the inner wall of said head pipe 

(1), a projecting tongue (11), the lower surface of 
which is formed by a concave curved surface (12) and in 

which the interior space of said head pipe (1) is 
divided into two parts including an acoustic space (A) 

and a fluid space (B), a concave portion (13) having a 
cross-sectional area (M) equal to that of said 

projecting tongue (11) is provided on the lower portion 
of said inner surface (5) of said head pipe (1) which is 

continuous to said concave curved surface (12), so that 
the straight travel property of a sound is enhanced by 

an interference of a sound wave and the efficiency of 
exhalation converting its energy to a sound is enhanced, 

thereby making it possible to obtain a clear, vigorous, 
and rich quality sound. In addition, since the high-pitched 

tones of the scale of the flute cannot possibly 
be not true and a sound cannot possibly be confined 

inside, a sufficiently clear, vigorous, rich, and loud 
quality sound can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flute 
mouthpiece, and, more particularly, to a flute mouthpiece 
in which a sound cannot possibly be confined 
inside or become unclear, and with which a clear, 
vigorous, rich, and loud quality sound can be produced 
at all times. The present inventor has already studied and 
invented a flute mouthpiece designed to produce a rich, 
good quality sound by dividing the interior space of a 
pipe into two parts, including an acoustic space and a 
fluid space, by forming a projecting tongue. More specifically, in the flute mouthpiece 2a 
shown in FIG. 1, in which a continuous inner surface 
extending from an edge 4a through the inner surface of a 
hole 3a to the upper portion of an inner surface 5a of a 
head pipe 1a is formed to be a streamlined surface 6a to 
produce a laminar flow free of any turbulence, the inner 
surface of the hole 3a on this side, on which the lip is 
to be placed, is made to extend downward into the head 
pipe 1a to form, on the inner wall of the head pipe 1a, 
a projecting tongue 11a, the lower surface of which is 
formed by a concave curved surface 12a, so that the  
 
interior space of the head pipe 1a is divided into two 
parts including an acoustic space A and a fluid space B. An exhalation 7a sent through the gap between 
the lips is trained against the edge 4a and is therefore 
divided into halves as indicated by an inside vector 8a 
and an outside vector 9a. The air stream indicated by 
the inside vector 8a then flows along the edge 4a, the 
streamlined surface 6a, and the inner surface 5a of the 
head pipe 1a in this sequence. It is to be noted that a 
sound is produced when air blown against the edge 4 
vibrates vertically in the acoustic space A. That is, 
the streamline indicated by the inside vector 8a becomes 
a laminar flow without forming any turbulence and, 
moreover, this flow swirls along the concave curved 
surface 12a of the projecting tongue 11a within the head 
pipe 1a and becomes a helical flow which, in turn, moves 
forward within the head pipe 1a. Due to this helical 
flow, an inward inflow vector 10a from the hole 3a 
toward the inner part acts to cause a type of vortex 
absorption, and this inflow vector 10a flows into a 
region of the fluid space B located below the projecting 
tongue 10a and has the function of joining the helical 
flow of the inside vector 8a. In the case of the above-described flute 
mouthpiece, however, since the inner surface of the hole 
3a on this side is made to extend downward into the head 
pip
