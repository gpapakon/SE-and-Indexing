<ABSTRACT>
A process and method for producing strained and defect free 
semiconductor layers. In a preferred embodiment, silicon on 

insulator may be used as a substrate for the growth of 
fully relaxed SiGe buffer layers. A new strain relief 

mechanism operates, whereby the SiGe layer relaxes without 
the generation of threading dislocations within the SiGe 

layer. This is achieved by depositing SiGe on an SOI 
substrate with a superficial silicon thickness. Initially 

the strain in the SiGe layer becomes equalized with the 
thin Si layer by creating tensile strain in the Si layer. 

Then the strain created in the thin Si layer is relaxed by 
plastic deformation during an anneal. Since dislocations 

are formed, and glide in the thin Si layer, threading dislocations 
are not introduced into the upper SiGe material. 

A strained silicon layer for heterostructures may then be 
formed on the SiGe material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor substrate structure. 
More particularly it relates to a pseudostructure on 
which a strained silicon layer may be grown for purposes of 
producing strained silicon based heterostructures. Recently, there has been a high level of activity using 
strained Si-based heterostructures to achieve high mobility 
structures for FET applications. Traditionally, the method 
to implement this has been to grow strained Si layers on a 
relaxed SiGe buffer. In this configuration, doping the 
SiGe layer leads to modulation doping of the tensile 
strained Si channel. Over the years, continual improvements 
in the buffer layers have led to an increase in the 
channel electron mobility to > 150,000 cm²/Vs at 4.2⁰ K. 
However, there are several disadvantages to the growth of 
these thick buffer layers. First, as they are typically a 
micrometer to several micrometers thick, they are not easy 
to integrate with Si technology. Second, the defect 
density in these thick buffers is still high, about to 10⁴ 
to 10⁷ cm⁻² which is too high for realistic VLSI consideration. 
Thirdly, the nature of the structure precludes 
selective growth of the SiGe so that circuits employing 
devices with strained Si, unstrained Si and SiGe material 
are difficult to integrate. This may be necessary since 
the strained Si channel is not usable as a high mobility 
hole channel and CMOS applications will not be optimized. 
Finally the high residual defect density may preclude 
obtaining the highest mobility possible. Besides the FET  
 
applications there is interest in relaxed buffer layers for 
other structures such as zone folding in monolayer type 
superlattices or resonant tunneling diodes. In order to produce relaxed SiGe material on a Si 
substrate, conventional practice has been to grow a 
uniform, graded, or stepped, SiGe layer to beyond the 
metastable critical thickness (that is the thickness beyond 
which dislocations form to relieve stress) and allow misfit 
dislocations to form, with the associated threading dislocations, 
through the SiGe layer. Various buffer structures 
have been used to try to increase the length of the misfit 
dislocation sections in the structures and thereby reduce 
the threading dislocation density. It is a principal object of the present invention to 
provide a strained silicon layer for the fabrication of 
heterostructures. It is another object of the present invention to provide a 
pseudo-substrate which includes a layer of a semiconductor 
having a different
