<ABSTRACT>
Crystals are formed by epitaxial growth on a monocrystalline substrate of gallium arsenide, and the orientation 
of the crystallographical plane of the substrate is inclined at an angle of under one degree with respect to the orientation 

of the crystallographical plane of one of the {100} planes thereof. At least a part of the epitaxial crystals are crystals 
of In
x
Ga
(1-x)
As (where 0 
<
 x 
<
 1). The epitaxial growth is made by a thermal decomposition vapor phase growth 
method. The microscopical surface roughness of the In
x
Ga
(1-x)
As layer is small. The variation of the film thickness is 
also small. Therefore, by using this epitaxial substrate for the channel layer of a field effect transistor, and the active 

layer of a semiconductor laser, it is possible to give excellent characteristics to these elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an epitaxial substrate of a 
compound semiconductor comprising a gallium arsenide 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as GaAs) single crystal 
substrate having formed thereon a compound semiconductor 
epitaxial layer by epitaxial vapor phase growth. The field of various electronic devices using 
semiconductors has been and will be achieving rapid 
development. For the time being, silicon is used as a main 
semiconductor substrate. In recent years, compound 
semiconductors showing high-speed properties, such as GaAs, 
have been steadily developed. Various semiconductor devices endowed with desired 
performance properties are generally obtained by forming a 
crystal layer having necessary characteristics on a single 
crystal substrate by various techniques, such as ion 
implantation, diffusion, and epitaxial growth. Above all, 
epitaxial growth has been spreading because it enables not 
only control of the amount of an impurity but control of the  
 
crystal composition or thickness over an extremely broad 
range and with high precision. Known methods for epitaxial growth include liquid 
phase epitaxy, vapor phase epitaxy, and molecular beam 
epitaxy (hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as MBE), one of 
vacuum evaporation. Vapor phase epitaxy among them is 
capable of processing a large quantity of substrates under 
control and is therefore widely employed on an industrial 
scale. In particular, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition 
(hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as MOCVD), which comprises 
vaporizing an organometallic compound or a metal hydride of 
an atomic species that is to constitute an epitaxial layer 
and thermally decomposing the vapor on a substrate to cause 
crystal growth, has recently been extending its use on 
account of its applicability to a wide range of materials and 
suitability for precise control of crystal composition and 
thickness. For example, a high electron mobility transistor, 
sometimes called a modulation doped transistor (MODFET) or a 
hetero-junction field effect transistor (HJFET), hereinafter 
inclusively referred to as HEMT, is one kind of field effect 
transistors (FET) and is of importance as an element of low 
noise amplifiers in microwave communication systems. The 
crystal used in HEMT is prepared by making a GaAs crystal and 
an AℓGaAs crystal having necessary electronic characteristics  
 
successively grow in a necessary structure on a GaAs 
substrate by the above-mentioned vapor phase growth. Crystals for semiconductor lasers,
