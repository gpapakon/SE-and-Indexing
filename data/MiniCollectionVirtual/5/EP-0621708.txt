<ABSTRACT>
A Medium Access (MAC) Protocol is utilized for wireless 
radio access for a plurality of remote stations to a base 

station on a LAN. The MAC protocol is based on a 
reservation scheme for user data traffic and a random 

access technique for control and signalling traffic. 
There is a time division fixed frame structure in which 

time is slotted, and time slots are grouped into fixed 
frames consisting of data and control subframes or 

periods. The fixed frame structure consists of three 
periods (A, B, and C) along with their respective 

headers. The first period, the A period, is the outbound 
channel which is used exclusively for data transfer from 

the base station to the remote stations. The following 
period, the B period, is the inbound channel that is used 

for contention-free data transfer from the remote 
stations to the base station. The allocation of the data 

slots in the A and B periods is performed by the base 
station. The last period of the frame, designated as the 

C period, is the control channel used for the 
transmission of reservation requests and data from the 

remote stations to the base station in a random-access 
contention mode using a slotted Aloha protocol. The 

duration of the three periods may be varied using a 
movable boundary technique. The base station estimates 

the number of actively transmitting remote stations 
utilizing feedback information from the remote stations. 

This estimate is broadcast to the remote stations as 
control indicia to control their transmission attempts in 

the C period, thus yielding high transmission efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data communications, and
in particular such communications in a Local Area Network
(LAN(). There, the invention is directed to a Medium Access
Control (MAC) protocol for wireless access in a LAN.Specifically, the invention relates to a digital data radio
communication system and to a method of operating the same
according to the preamble of claims 1 and 15, respectively.The need for personal wireless communications is expanding
rapidly with the advances in digital communications and
personal communications systems. The progress in cellular
radio technology and the growth rate of the cellular telephone
systems over the last years is indicative of tremendous market
demand for location independence communication via wireless
access. Many of the current wireless networks architectures
are primarily designed and optimized for voice communications
and wide area coverage. With the proliferation of personal and
portable computers, and local area networks, it is envisioned
that data services and applications such as file server
access, client-server execution, and electronic mail will
require wireless access in the LAN enviroment supporting
distributed computing. Since the characteristics and profile
of data traffic are very different from those of voice
traffic, the wireless access protocol must efficiently
accommodate the very dynamic and bursty nature of data
traffic. A digital data radio communication system and a method of
operating the same according to the preambles of claims 1 and
15 is known from IEEE INFOCOM'93. THE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER
COMMUNICATIONS. TWELFTH ANNUAL JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE
