<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hatch, especially as a cover for flue gas vents in roofs, with an adjustable-height hatch cover, and proposes, in order to obtain a particularly efficient system, that the height adjustment is obtained by the longitudinal movement in oblique slide slots (8, 35) of lifting members (12, 32) on the underside of the hatch cover (6, 7 and 26, 27). The device comprises in particular two hatch covers (6, 7 and 26, 27) which can be moved up and down synchronously and in opposite directions and are allocated to the upper and lower edge of the roof vent (2 and 23) for the purpose of closing.

Hatch, in particular as closure for flue-gas openings on roofs or the like, with a 
vertically displaceable hatch cover for opening and closing through a central 

adjusting device, characterised in that the vertical displacement is derived from 
the longitudinal movement in sliding slots (8, 35) extending in a sloping manner 

for lifting members (12, 32) on the underside of the hatch cover (6, 7 or 26, 27). 
Hatch according to claim 1, characterised by two synchronously and opposingly 
vertically displaceable hatch covers (6, 7 or 26, 27) for closure associated with 

the upper and lower edge of the roof opening (2 or 23). 
Hatch according to one or several of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the sliding slots (8, 35) are arranged in uniform circumferential distribution in the 

region of a casing wall (4 or 25) located in the opening. 
Hatch according to one or several of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
a screw-thread rotation is superimposed on the vertical displacement of the hatch 

cover (6, 7). 
Hatch according to one or several of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the lifting members (12) of the hatch cover (6, 7) are formed from vertically 

extending connecting rods (12) which are fastened at one end to the hatch cover 
(6, 7) and at the other end are equipped with shoes (11) and in the region in 

between are linked to control arms (13) which are displaceable by a motor-driven 
lifting rod (16) of the adjusting device (5). 
Hatch according to claim 5, characterised in that the lifting rod (16) and motor 
drive (17) are located approximately on the longitudinal central plane through the 

casing wall (4).  
 
Hatch according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the pivotal point (15) sits 
between the lifting rod (16) and control arm (13) on a ring (20) guided in a 

rotating manner at the casing wall side. 
Hatch according to one or several of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the sliding slots (35) are provided at the lateral edge of correspondingly wider 

brackets (34) which are arranged on the hatch covers (26, 27) guided linearly in 
the vertical direction and that the lifting members guiding within it are designed 

as motor-driven slide plates (32). 
Hatch according to claim 8, characterised in the slide plates (32) are connected 
to one another by means of a ring (36) guided in a rotating manner and extending 

along the casing wall (25).
