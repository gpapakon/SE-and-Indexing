<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an original reading 
apparatus including a pre-scan mode for reading a color 

reference member before an original is read, a 
registration mode for aligning a tip end of the original 

before the original is read, and a reading mode for 
conveying and readin
g the original. The reading apparatus 
further comprises first and second rotary member to 

perform the above three modes, and these modes are 
effected by selectively rotating the first and second 

rotary members in a normal direction and/or reverse 
direction and selectively stopping the first or second 

rotary member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an original reading apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1 and an information processing
apparatus having such an original reading apparatus
and more particularly it relates to an information
processing apparatus such as a facsimile, an image
reader, a digital copying machine, an electronic black
board and the like having a reading apparatus as an
input portion for reading information on an original
to be read while relatively shifting the original in
a condition that the original is closely contacted
(including light contact) with an original reading
surface.Recently, in order to make information
processing apparatuses such as facsimiles, image
readers and the like compact and to improve the
performance of such information processing apparatuses,
there has been proposed an elongated line-sensor which
can be used with an equi-magnification optical system
as a photoelectric conversion device for a reading
apparatus or which can be used without any specific 
optical system. Particularly, reading apparatuses
wherein reflection light including information from an
original can be directly detected by a photoelectric
conversion device through a transparent spacer such as
glass without using an equi-magnification fiber lens
array, thereby making the apparatus compact and
inexpensive have been put to practical use.Incidentally, hereinafter, an optical conversion
apparatus of the type wherein information is read
without any optical system is referred to as "image
sensor of complete contact type". Fig. 24 is a schematic
sectional view of a reading apparatus of a conventional
facsimile system in which an image sensor of complete
contact type is used as an image information reading
apparatus and which includes an original separation
roller and a contact sensor roller (CS roller) as a
convey means.A flow of an original in Fig. 24 is as follows.
When an original bundle 103 is inserted from an original
insertion opening 101 into an original insertion path
102, a signal from an original presence/absence
detection sensor (not shown) is sent to a control
portion so that an original presence condition is
ascertained by the apparatus. Further, the original
bundle 103 is inserted to reach an original separation
portion 106 which includes an original separation roller
104, and an original separation piece 105 opposed to the 
original separation roller 104 with the interposition
of an original convey path and biased toward the
original separation roller 104 by a biasing means (not
shown

<CLAIMS>
An original reading apparatus including a reading means comprising:

a first rotary member for conveying an original:
an image information reading portion disposed downstream of
said first rotary member; and
a second rotary member, disposed downstream of said first
rotary member and opposed to said image information reading portion

for conveying the original,
said apparatus being operative to perform:
a pre-scan mode for reading a color reference member by said
reading portion before the original is read by said reading portion,

the pre-scan mode being effected such that said reading
portion is caused to be opposed to the color reference member by

relatively shifting said reading means and the color reference
member;
a registration operation for aligning a tip end of the
original before the original is read, and
a reading mode for reading the original by said reading
means and conveying the original,

characterized by that:
the pre-scan mode is effected by rotating said second rotary
member in a reverse direction, the registration operation is effected

by stopping said second rotary member and by rotating said first
rotary member in a normal direction, and the reading mode is effected

by rotating said second rotary member in a normal direction.
An original reading apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the normal rotation, reverse rotation and stoppage of said first

and second rotary members are effected by controlling normal and 
reverse rotations of a single motor and a delay mechanism for

transmitting the rotation of said motor with a time lag.
An original reading apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said image information reading portion and said color

reference member are relatively shifted by rotating said second
rotary member in the reverse direction to face said image information

reading portion and said color reference member to each
other.
An original reading apparatus according to claim 3, wherein
said image information reading portion is shifted towards said

color reference member by a friction force generated by the reverse
rotation of said second rotary member and is returned to a

position where said image information reading portion faces said
secondary rotary member by a friction force generated by the

normal rotation of said second rotary member.
A reading apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said pre-scan
mode, said registration operation and said reading mode are effected by normal

and reverse rotations of a single motor and an output gear
train.
A reading apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said first
rotary member comprises an original separation roller for separating

the original from an original bundle one by one and said
second rotary member comprises a contact sensor roller for urging

the original against said image information reading portion,

said contact sensor roller and a contact sensor roller
output gear and between said original separation roller and an

original separation roller output gear, respectively, and a
clutch mechanism disposed between the single motor as a drive

source and said original separation roller output gear for mechanically
permitting or preventing the transmission of power to

said original separation roller output gear on the basis of a
rotational direction of the single motor.

toward an axial direction of said roller so that, when said

roller output gear is rotated, if said projection of said roller
output gear is separated from said projection of said roller

output member, a driving force of said roller output gear is not
transmitted to said roller output member to keep said roller

stationary, whereas, if said projection of said roller output
gear is contacted with said projection of said roller output

member, the driving force of said roller output gear is transmitted
to said roller output member to rotate said roller.
A reading apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said
clutch mechanism for mechanically permitting or preventing the

transmission of power to said original separation roller output
gear on the basis of the rotational direction of the single motor
