<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop a suction cannula (1) for dental use further in such a way that the dentist can treat a patient even without assistance and without any risk to the patient due to the working equipment, and such that there are no superfluous manipulations for changing the instruments, and such that this further development is simple and reliable to operate and economic to produce it is proposed that the suction cannula (1) have an approximately U-shaped attachment (10) which lies at an obtuse angle relative to the suction end (2) of the cannula (1) and has two side walls (11, 12) and a vertex piece (13) which connects these two side walls (11, 12), the suction orifice (3) of the cannula (1) opening in one of the side walls (11; 12) of the "U" (10), which have a width adapted to the dental lamina (4) with tooth (5). The second, free leg (12; 11) of the "U" (10) located opposite the leg (11; 12) allocated to the suction orifice (3) is offset in height relative to the latter leg and the vertex piece (13) of the "U" (10) is formed such that it engages over the dental lamina (4). The protective attachment (10) is integrally formed on the cannula (1) and is preferably designed as a plastic injection moulding.

A suction tube system (1) for dental purposes having 
a suction tube (2) with a suction end, attached to 

which is an extension piece (10) with a suction end 
(2) arranged at an angle "ε" which can be inserted in 

the mouth to bridge the row of teeth, whereby the 
extension-piece is approximately of a U-shaped 

design and has a first and a second side-piece as 
well as a top-piece linking these side-pieces and 

being of a width which matches the row of teeth (4) 
and tooth (5), wherein the suction end opens at a 

suction orifice in the first side-piece, wherein the 
side-pieces (11, 12) and top-piece (13) are walls 

and wherein the second side wall (12; 11) arranged 
opposite the side wall (12; 11) of the "U" (10) which 

has the suction orifice (3) is arranged at a height 
which is offset relative to this first oppositely 

arranged side wall (12; 11) of the "U" (10), 

characterised in that
 the extension-piece (10) and 
the suction end (2) of the suction-tube system (1) 

subtend an angle "ε" of between 80° and 135° and the 
essentially flat side-pieces (11, 12) of the 

extension-piece (10) subtend an angle "δ" of up to 
30° in their longitudinal extensions such that the 

free end of the second side wall (12) reaches at 
least the top edge of the first side wall (11), the 

heights thereof being such that the upper edges of 
both side walls reach at least the upper edges of 

the teeth (5) in the row of teeth (4) when in the 
operating position. 
A suction-tube system as claimed in claim 1, 

characterised in that
 by preference, the extension-piece  
 

(10) is integrally moulded onto the suction-tube 
system (1) which is a plastics injection-moulded 

member. 
A suction-tube system as claimed in claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the extension-piece (10), 
which is preferably a plastics injection-moulded 

member, can be attached to the suction orifice (3) 
of the suction-tube system (1). 
A suction-tube system as claimed in claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the extension-piece (10) has 
a mirrored surface (15; 16), at least in the region 

of the top-piece, (13) outwardly inclined at an 
angle "α" of up to 20° directed towards the interior 

space of the open "U" of the extension-piece (10). 
A suction-tube system as claimed in claim 4, 

characterised in that
 the mirrored surfaces(s) (15, 
16) is/are formed by reflective surfaces (15', 16', 

16'') provided on the internal faces of at least one 
of the side walls (11; 12) and/or the top-piece 

(13), the mirrored surfaces being made by preference 
of a layer of metal such as titanium or chromium. 
A suction-tube system as claimed in one of claims 1 
to 5, 
characterised in that
 the "U" formed by the 
first side wall (11), the second side wall (12) and 

the top-piece (13) is of a tapered shape opening at 
an angle "α" up to about 40°. 
A suction-tube system as claimed in one of claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that at least the second side 

wall (12) arranged opposite the first side wall (11)  
 

which has the suction orifice (3) is outwardly 
inclined at an angle "β" of up to about 20°. 
A suction-tube system as claimed in one of claims 1 
to 7, 
characterised in that
 the top-piece (13) of 
the "U" (10) and/or the second side wall (12) 

arranged opposite the first side wall (11) which has 
the suction orifice (3) is of a smaller width than 

the first side wall (11). 
A suction-tube system as claimed in one of claims 1 
to 9, 
characterised in that
 at least the lower edge 
of the first side wall (11) with the suction orifice 

(3) is a bulbous support surface (11.1) preferably 
bending round towards the second side wall (12) and 

the upper edge of the top-piece (13) of the 
extension-piece (10) preferably has a gripping bead 

(21).
