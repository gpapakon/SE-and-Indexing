<DESCRIPTION>
One of the most common practices for controlling 
undesirable plant species is the use of herbicides. 
However, it is known that when certain herbicides 
are applied in effective amounts they may also 
damage the crop plants. For example, certain herbicides 
which are effective against certain annual and 
perennial grass weeds cannot be used in all crops, 
especially cereal crops such as corn, sorghum, oat, 
wheat, barley and rice because the herbicide injures 
the crops as well as controlls the weeds. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a method for protecting crops from 
injury caused by an herbicide which comprises applying 
to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or the soil or 
water surrounding the crop or crop seed an effective 
antidotal amount of a substituted benzopyran or tetrahydronaphthalene 
compound. It is also an object of the present invention 
to provide a safened herbicidal composition comprising 
a herbicide and a substituted benzopyran or tetrahydronaphthalene 
compound. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide compounds useful as safeners.  
 These and other objects of the present 
invention will become more apparent from the detailed 
description thereof set forth below. The present invention relates to a method for 
protecting crops from injury caused by a herbicidally 
effective amount of a herbicide by applying to the crop 
plant, the seed of the crop, or the soil or water 
surrounding the crop or crop seed an effective antidotal 
amount of a substituted benzopyran or tetrahydronaphthalene 
compound of formula I 
 
wherein 
X isO, S(O)q or CH2; q isan integer of 0, 1 or 2; Z, Z1 and Z2 areeach independently hydrogen, 
halogen, C3-C10 alkenyl, C3-C10 alkynyl, furfuryl, 
C1-C7 alkoxy, C3-C10 alkenyloxy, Z3C(O), Z4S(O)p, 
C1-C10 alkyl optionally substituted with one or 
more halogen atoms, hydroxy groups, amino 
groups, thio groups, C1-C5 alkylcarbonyl 
groups or C1-C5 alkoxy groups, or 
phenoxy optionally substituted with one or more 
halogen atoms or 
C1-C4 alkyl groups optionally substituted 
with one or more halogen atoms; Z3 isC1-C6 alkyl; Z4 isC1-C6 alkyl;  
 p isan integer of 0, 1 or 2; Y and Y1 areeach independently hydrogen, 
C1-C6 alkyl, halogen, phenyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, amino 
or C1-C6 alkylcarbonyl; represents a single or double bond with the proviso 
that when  represents a double bond then Y1 is 
not present; W and W1 areeach independently (CRR1)rA, and when
