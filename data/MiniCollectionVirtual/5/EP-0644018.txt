<ABSTRACT>
A rail construction for a machine tool includes a bed (11) made 
of a resin 

concrete, a pair of laterally spaced rails (12) made of a resin concrete, 
extending along a lengthwise direction of the bed, and having an upper 

portion (12a) on which a slidable table (13) is mounted for a movement 
thereof, and 

a reinforcing member (14,15) inserted into each of the rails such 
that the 

reinforcing member is out of concern with the movement of the slide 
table along the upper surface of each of the rails.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rail construction for a machine 
tool. As shown in Fig. 8, a conventional machine tool includes a bed 71 
made of a resin concrete, a pair of laterally spaced rails 76 extending 
along a lengthwise direction of the bed 71, and a slide table 77 on 
which a head portion (not shown) is mounted. The rail 76 is made of a 
steel. Whenever the table 77 moves along the rail 76, due to the 
friction therebetween a heat is generated. Due to the fact that the 
resin concrete is less than the rail 76 in thermal conductivity, the 
resulting sliding heat will cause a curvature or bent of the rail 76 
relative to the bed 71. Such a curvature will prevent a smooth movement 
of the table 77. JP-A-59.124.533, the closest prior art, discloses a resin concrete structure 
comprising guide rails made of steel and supporting member made 
of epoxy concrete to secure high accuracy. EP-A-0.253.390 discloses a concrete support structure 
comprising a "V" metallic guide rails on which is sliding a 
concrete body. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide 
a rail construction for a machine tool without the foregoing drawbacks. Another object of the present invention is to provide a rail 
construction for a machine tool in which each rail is free from a 
thermal curvature. In order to attain the foregoing objects, a rail 
construction for a machine tool comprising a bed made of a 
resin concrete and a pair of laterally spaced rails, extending  
 
along a lengthwise direction of the bed is characterised in 
that the pair of laterally spaced rails is made of a resin 
concrete and has an upper portion on which a slidable table is 
mounted for a movement thereof, and in that a reinforcing 
member is inserted into each of the rails such that the 
reinforcing member is out of concern with the movement of the 
slide table along the upper surface of each of the rails. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present 
invention will be more apparent and more readily appreciated from the 
following detailed description of preferred exemplarily embodiments of 
the present invention, taken in connection with the accompanying 
drawings, in which; 
Fig.1 is a schematic view of a machine tool to which the present 
invention is applied; Fig.2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line X-X in Fig.1 for 
illustrating a first embodiment of the present invention; Fig.3 is a view showing a principal portion of a second embodiment 
of the present invention; Fig.4 is a view

<CLAIMS>
A rail construction for a machine tool (70) comprising 
a bed (11) mad
e of a resin concrete and a pair of laterally 
spaced rails (12), extending along a lengthwise direction of 

the bed, characterised in that 

the pair of laterally spaced rails (12) is made of a resin 
concrete and has an upper portion (12a) on which a slidable 

table (13) is mounted for a movement thereof; and in that 
a reinforcing member (14, 15) is inserted into each of the
