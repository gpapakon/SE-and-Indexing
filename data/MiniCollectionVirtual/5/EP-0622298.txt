<ABSTRACT>
A food product (6) packeting plant of the type comprising a 
plurality of packeting lines (1), each line consisting of the 

following components arranged in series: first means (2) for 
conveying products one after another towards an entry station (3) 

which for each line comprises a guide (4) for bringing together 
the parallel major edges (5A) of a product packeting film (5), so 

as to continuously fold the film substantially into the form of a 
tube, the products being introduced into the tube-folded film by 

the first conveyor means, a longitudinal welding station (7) 
comprising meals (7A; 12) for welding the tube-folded film such as 

to join said edges together and for advancing the film and the 
products inserted into them, a film transverse welding station 

(11) for welding and cutting the film transversely between one 
product and the next, and means (16) for removing the thus 

packeted products from the transverse welding station. Said 
components of each line are independent of the components of the 

other line, the components being electronically controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a food product packeting plant of the 
type comprising at least two packeting lines consisting of the 
following arranged in series: first means for conveying products 
one after another towards an entry station which for each line 
comprises a guide for bringing together the parallel major 
(longitudinal) edges of a packeting film for the products of each 
line so as to continuously fold the film substantially into the 
form of a tube, the products being introduced into the tube-folded 
film by the first conveyor means, a longitudinal welding station 
comprising means for welding the tube-folded film such as to join 
said edges together arid for advancing the film and the products 
inserted into them, a film transverse welding station for welding 
and cutting the film transversely between one product and the 
next, and means for removing the thus packeted products from the 
transverse welding station. Plants of the aforesaid type are known comprising two parallel 
packeting lines containing a single transverse welding station 
common to the two lines. These also comprise common means for 
feeding the products and film to said station. The most serious drawback of such plants is related to the fact 
that if one of the packeting lines has to be halted due to 
maloperation, for example because a product has remained wedged 
between the welding members of the transverse welding station, the 
operation of the other line also has to be halted, with serious 
consequences in terms of production time and cost. Such  
 
interruptions are relatively frequent in that the products have to 
be conveyed towards the welding station on both lines in phase 
with the movement of the common transverse welding member. It should also be noted that products wedged in the welding 
station are not always easy to remove, in that being common to the 
two lines the station is relatively bulky and therefore access to 
the welding members, in particular those of the line more distant 
from the operator, is very difficult. An object of the present invention is to provide a plant of the 
aforesaid type in which the components of the packeting lines and 
in particular the transverse welding stations are mutually 
independent, the stoppage of one packeting line therefore having 
no consequences for the other lines. A further object is to provide a plant in which the components of 
all the lines are easily accessible to a single operator. These and further objects which will be apparent to an expert of 
the art

<CLAIMS>
A food product packeting plant of the type comprising at 
least two packeting lines consisting of the following components 

arranged in series: first means for conveying products one after 
another towards an entry station which for each line comprises a 

guide for bringing together the parallel major longitudinal edges 
of a packeting film for the products 
of each line so as to 
continuously fold the film substantially into the form of a tube, 

the products being introduced into the tube-folded film by the 
first conveyor means, a longitudinal welding station comprising 

means (7A; 12) for welding the tube-folded film such as to join 
said edges together and for advancing the film and the products 

inserted into them towards a film transverse welding station for 
welding and cutting the film transversely between one product and 

the next, and means for removing the thus packeted products from 
the transverse welding station, characterised in that each 

packeting line (1) comprises its own entry station (3), its own 
station (7; 12) for longitudinally welding and advancing the film 

and the products contained in it, and its own transverse welding 
station (11), said components of each line being independent of 

the corresponding components of the other line, the operation of 
each line therefore being independent of that of the other line, 

said components being electronically controlled. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
transverse welding stations (11) of the packeting lines are 

positioned in staggered formation. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
entry stations (3) of the packeting lines are positioned in 

staggered formation. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
entry station (3) and transverse welding station (11) of each 

packeting line are positioned at the opposite ends of a slide 
table (10), the slide tables of the various lines being of 

 
different lengths. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the 
entry stations (3) and welding stations (11) are arranged 

staggered and lie along substantially converging straight lines 
(D, E). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that each 
line has its own conveyor means (2) and its own product removal 

means (16), these being mutually independent. 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the means (16) for removing products from 

the transverse welding stations (11) of each line have mutually 
different speeds. 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the conveyor means (2) are connected via 

transmission members to a single motor (31), the transmission 
members for the conveyor means of each line comprising a clutch 

member (31A), so as to be able to selectively interrupt the 
movement of said means of each line. 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the conveyor means of each line comprise at 

least one movable part (40) so as to be able to convey the 
products either towards a first line or towards a second line 

adjacent to the first.
