<ABSTRACT>
In a cellular telephone network the geographical area covered by the network is subdivided into a large number of small sub-areas of generally equal shape and size. The received signal strengths are measured at each sub-area and the source of the strongest signal for the sub-area is defined as the serving cell site and the remaining signals as interferer signals. Carrier to interference (CIR) ratios are thereafter calculated and compared to a predetermined minimum CIR level for the network. For each cell site of the network the total number of sub-areas in which signal strengths have been ascertained is aggregated and compared with the number of such sub-areas in which the CIR is above the minimum value, to thereby determine the probability of interference occurring in that cell with one or more signals received from other cell sites if the same channel frequency is reused. The method therefore provides a means to optimize channel selection by selecting a channel having the lowest probability of co-channel interference.

<DESCRIPTION>
, „ΛΛ^ PCT/GB93/01126 02995Method of Optimizing Channel Selection in Cellular Telephone NetworksThis invention relates to cellular telephone networks and is primarily, but not exclusively, concerned with optimizing the selection of channels throughout part or all of such networks to minimize interference and maximize the performance and capacity of the network.Cellular telephone networks stem from the realization that it is statistically improbable for a large number of subscribers to such a telephone system to be geographically close to each other at any given instant in time and/or would wish to make or receive radio telephone calls at the same time in the same location.Given the finite number of radio channels which are available for use within radio telephone networks, the cellular network system provides a means whereby a very large number of calls can be made or received at the same time using a relatively small number of channels. To achieve this, short-range transmitters and receivers are installed 

in a cell-like configuration over the entire area covered by the telephone network, each such cell having a different range of radio channels to that of a neighboring cell, but often the same as those of several other cells in the network.Although the or each radio transmitter in each cell is relatively short-range, it will be appreciated that it would still be possible for signals of any particular channel to be picked up by receivers in nearby cells where the same channel is being reused, which can then lead to "cross-talk" interference during telephone calls. To minimize this undesirable effect it is necessary to ensure that the signal strength from a nearby cell using the same channel is sufficiently less than the signal strength for the same channel used in a particular cell so as to enable the weaker signal to be differentiated and discarded so that only the stronger signal is used during the telephone call.To achieve this aim, in the construction of cellular radio systems the concept of Carrier-to-interference Ratio (CIR) is used, meaning, essentially, the ratio of the carrier signal strength in one cell compared- 9 

with interfering signal strength received from a nearby cell using the same channel frequency.The CIR may also be conveniently expressed in decibels where the actual signal strength is measured in Watts. Thus, if the strength of the carrier signal in a channel is measured to be, say,-7 C=lθxlθ W, then C(m decibel expression) can be written to be 10 times the logarithm of the

Claims
1. A method of optimizing channel selection in a radio telephone network of the type utilizing a plurality of radio stations comprised of transmitters/receivers and antennae arranged in a cell-like configuration, the method comprising the steps of:-
(a) defining a minimum acceptable level of carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) for the network,
(b) subdividing the geographical area covered by the network into a large number of small sub-areas of generally equal shape and size,
(c) ascertaining the strength of signals received from respective stations within the network at at least one location within all or a large number of sub-areas,
(d) for each such sub-area and for each transmitter defining the average value of the ascertained signal strength as representing the average 


 signal strength for the transmitter in all parts of that sub-area,
(e) defining the transmission source of the strongest such signal as the serving cell-site centre for that sub-area and the signal itself as the carrier signal,
(f) defining the remaining such signals from other transmitters within the network as interfering signals and for each calculating the CIR with respect to the carrier signal for that sub-area,
(g) for each cell-site of the network aggregating the total number of sub-areas in which signal strength have been ascertained and comparing the number of such sub-areas in which each CIR is above the minimum acceptable value with the aggregate total of sub-areas in the cell-site, to thereby determine the probability of no interference occurring that cell with one or more signals received from other cell-sites within the network if the same channel is re-used, and 



(h) when choosing a channel for use in a cell, selecting the one having the lowest probability of interference with signals from other cells using the same channel, thereby to optimize channel selection.
2. The method according to Claim 1 further characterized in that the sub-areas are defined by a grid system using longitude and latitude to identify each such sub-area.
3. The method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which layers of sub-areas of generally equal shape and size, but vertically separated, are provided.
4. The method according to any one of the preceding claims further characterized in that the probability of interference occurring in a cell in which the same channel is being used elsewhere within the network is expressed as a level of confidence.
5. The method according to Claim 5 in which the confidence is expressed in the form of a look-up table. 


6. The method according to Claim 4 or Claim 5 in which the confidence is expressed as a percentage, 0% corresponding to a high probability that interference will be experienced and 100% corresponding to a very low or zero probability that interference will be experienced.
7. The method according to Claim 4 or Claim 5 in which the confidence is expressed as a CIR value above or below the minimum acceptable CIR for the network.
8. The method according to Claim 7 in which the confidence is expressed in dBs.
