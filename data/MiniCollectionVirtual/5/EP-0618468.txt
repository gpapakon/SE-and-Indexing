<ABSTRACT>
An optical interface including a base (71) with molded 
optical waveguides (74, 75) and overmolded electrical 

conductors (78, 79), with a keyway (72, 73) formed therein. 
A keyway mating portion (85, 86) molded around the ends of a 

plurality of optical fibers (26) to expose the ends of the 
fibers. With the keyway mating portion engaged in the 

keyway, openings (25) in a surface (24) of the keyway 
communicate light to/from the fibers, through the optical 

waveguides, from/to semiconductor devices on the base (76, 
77). The keyway accura
tely aligns the mating portion which 
aligns the ends of the fibers with the openings and, hence, 

the optical waveguides. Two different waveguide molding 
techniques are used and diffraction gratings (129) are used 

to introduce and/or receive light from the ends or mid-points 
of the waveguides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an electrical/optical
interface and more specifically to connectors utilizing
molded waveguides for coupling optical fibers to electronic
components.At present, it would be highly desirable to utilize
optical fibers and especially fiber ribbons, containing
pluralities of fibers, to transmit optical signals between
remote electrical components and over relatively long
distances. Optical fibers are desirable for these
applications because they have very high bandwidth
capabilities and are relatively easy and inexpensive to
manufacture.However, connecting optical semiconductor components,
such as light detectors and light generators (e.g., LEDs and
lasers) to the ends of the optical fibers is a difficult and
expensive task. Typically, two critical steps in optical
alignment are maximizing coupling efficiency and affixing of
an optical semiconductor component in an exact position
after alignment is achieved. Optical alignment which
maximizes coupling efficiency is completed by a process
called active alignment. The active alignment process is a
technique that positions optical semiconductor components
with an optical fiber as a signal is being passed through.
Active alignment is a labor intensive task and is not cost
effective to mass production of optical couplers and is
consequently is not an applicable manufacturing process.
Once the optical semiconductor component is aligned to the 
optical fiber, the optical semiconductor component and the
optical fiber must be locked in place with minimal movement.
Several current affixing methods or processes include
epoxies, laser welding, and low melting-point solder.
However, heat developed during these affixing process causes
both the optical semiconductor and optical fiber components
to expand and contract during cooling, thus causing a misalignment
and reduces coupling efficiency.Therefore, it is desirable to develop apparatus to
optimize the formation of electrical to optical links and
especially between optical semiconductor components and
optical fibers which increases performance and reduces
manufacturing costs.It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a
new and improved interface for coupling optical fibers to
electronic circuitry.It is another purpose of the present invention to
provide a new and improved interface for coupling optical
fibers to electronic circuitry which is capable of quick and
easy connections and disconnections between the optical
fibers and electronic circuits.It is another purpose of the
