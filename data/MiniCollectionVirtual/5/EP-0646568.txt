<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel dissolution inhibitors and
positive resist materials containing said dissolution inhibitors. In
particular, it is concerned with tert-butyl 4,4-bis(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-pentanoate
derivatives which exhibit excellent characteristics when
they are used as a dissolution inhibitor in a photoresist, and with
positive resist materials which contain said derivatives to be rendered
highly sensitive to high energy radiations, such as deep ultraviolet
rays (DUV), electron beams and X-rays, developable with an aqueous
alkali solution and well suitable for fine processing technology.In proportion as large scale integrated circuits (LSI) are
heightened in integration level and operation speed, further fining the
pattern rules is required. However, the light hitherto used in
photoexposure technology contained different wavelengths, and these
wavelengths were long. Consequently, there was a limit in fining the
pattern rules. Thus, it was tried to use as light source g-line (436
nm) or i-line (365 nm) emitted from an ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp.Even in those cases, however, the pattern rule limit was about 0.5µm
with respect to resolution, and the manufacture of LSI utilizing such
photoexposure arts can attain at best the integration level
corresponding to 16 Mbit DRAM.In this context, deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography using as a
light source deep ultraviolet rays, which are shorter in wavelength
than g-line and i-line, appears to offer promise as a new processing
technology.DUV lithography can achieve 0.1-0.3 µm resolutions in the imaging 
process, and can provide a pattern having effectively vertical walls
with respect to the substrate if a resist having a low optical
absorbance is used. Moreover, as this technology makes it possible to
transfer a pattern in one operation, it offers a higher throughput than
electron beam lithography.In recent years, on the other hand, high intensity KrF excimer
laser has been successfully used as the light source for DUV
lithography. In order that DUV lithography using such a light source
has practical utility in mass production of LSI, it is necessary to use
resist materials having low optical absorbance and high sensitivity at
the wavelength of that laser.Thus, there have been lately developed the chemical amplification
type resist materials which use an acid as a catalyst and possess not
only sensitivities equivalent to or higher than those of conventional
high sensitivity resists but also other excellent properties including
high
