comprising: a computer 32 connected to the kiln's 

controls; a plurality of mobile sensor units 34 to 
detect for example temperature, a number of such units 

being provided at different points on each kiln car; and 
an air core signal transformer 36 to transmit readings 

made by the units 34 to the computer 32. The computer

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements in or relating 
to control of processing equipment, especially kilns, and 
particularly but not exclusively: kiln control 
apparatus; kilns fitted with such an apparatus; and a 
method of kiln control. Kilns have been used for many years in the 
manufacture of ceramic articles. It is important to 
provide the correct atmospheric conditions within a kiln 
to ensure correct firing of the ceramic ware or other 
articles in the kiln. Atmospheric conditions will vary 
within the kiln and there will exist for example a 
temperature gradient with the highest temperatures being 
at or near the top of the kiln. Theoretical models can 
be constructed of such temperature gradients based on 
previous firings in order to try and provide a required 
temperature at any particular point in the kiln. 
However, such a temperature gradient is only theoretical 
and differences in for example the loading of ware in the 
kiln can alter this gradient as an increased weight of 
ware will absorb more heat. Furthermore, the shape of 
the ware can affect heat flow through the kiln. The atmospheric conditions in a kiln which are of 
particular importance to firing are especially 
temperature, but also humidity, and the levels of carbon  
 
monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen and sulphur oxide. According to the present invention there is 
provided control apparatus for processing equipment, the 
apparatus comprising a sensor locatable within the 
equipment for sensing atmospheric conditions, transmitter 
means for sending a signal from the sensor to a remote 
discrete receiver means, control means connected to the 
receiver means to decode signals received therefrom, the 
control means being connectable to the equipment so as to 
automatically control the functions of the equipment in 
response to the signals received. A plurality of sensors are preferably provided. 
One or more of the sensors is preferably locatable in a 
fixed position in the equipment whilst one or more other 
of the sensors is preferably locatable on support 
apparatus for articles being processed, such apparatus 
being movable into and out of the equipment. The sensors in the equipment and/or on the article 
support apparatus are preferably provided at different 
heights such that a profile of conditions in the 
equipment may be detected. The sensors preferably sense any of: temperature;  
 
humidity; carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, or 
sulpur oxide content. The sensors may also provide an indication of the 
location
