<ABSTRACT>
A rock crusher such as a cone crusher (16, 116) or jaw crusher (17) incorporates hardened tapered inserts (10, 110) in the manganese or other wear liner (24, 25, 124, 125, 140) of at least one of its crushing elements. The inserts (10, 110) extend outwardly from the crushing surface of the crushing element towards the facing crushing surface so as, in use, to act as pick axes that shatter rock primarily by impact rather than pulverizing the rock by compression. The inserts (10, 110) are fixed in a heat treated manganese wear liner (24, 25, 124, 125, 140) either by bonding or by press-fitting. The inserts (10, 110) substantially improve the life of the wear liner and, unexpectedly, 1) produce product of a highly uniform gradation in the desired ranges, 2) consistently produce product with a very high cubicity, 3) dramatically reduce the crusher's power requirements, and 4) significantly increase the crusher's capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to rock crushers such as cone or jaw crushers and, more particularly, relates to a rock crusher having inserts disposed on at least one crushing surface thereof for enhanced crushing action, enhanced wear resistance, enhanced capacity, and reduced power requirements. The invention additionally relates to a method of fabricating a wear liner having such inserts and to an improved method of crushing rock.Rock crushers have been used for centuries in quarry operations and the like to break large pieces of material, such as rock, stone and the like (hereinafter "rock"), into smaller pieces more suitable for applications such as road paving. There are many types of rock crushers including: cone crushers (also known as gyratory crushers), jaw crushers, impactors, hammermills, and pulverizers to name a few.Cone or gyratory crushers include an eccentrically gyratory conical head, an opposed bowl, and a crushing cavity or crushing chamber formed between the head and the bowl. Rock that falls into the crushing chamber is crushed by compression to a smaller size generally consistent with the size of the gap in the crushing cavity at the point at which the rock is struck. The average size of the stone formed from the crushing operation can be changed by adjusting the minimum gap between the bowl and the head, which minimum gap is known in the art as "the close side setting." For a more detailed description of the operation of a cone crusher is desired, reference may be had to U.S. Patent No. 3,750,967 to DeDiemar et al., entitled "Gyratory Crusher Having Interchangeable Head Mantles," issued August 7, 1973 and assigned to an assignee common with the present invention.A jaw crusher includes opposed generally rectangular dies, one of which is swingably movable relatively toward and away from the other to crush rock therebetween. For a more detailed description of the operation of a jaw crusher, see U.S. Patent No. 3,804,345 to DeDiemer, entitled "Jaw Crusher Die Mounting," issued April 16, 1979, and assigned to an assignee common with the present invention.The crushing surfaces of both cone crushers and jaw crushers suffer from severe and relatively rapid wear due to abrasive contact with the stone being crushed. In order to ameliorate this wear, both cone crushers and jaw crushers typically utilize as one and usually both crushing surfaces a replaceable hardened, wear-resistant manganese wear liner. A jaw crusher incorporating replaceable manganese wear liners is disclosed, for example, in U.S.

<CLAIMS>
A crusher (16, 17, 116) for crushing rock, said crusher comprising:

two opposed crushing elements, at least one of which is movable relative to the other thereby to crush rock therebetween, at least one of said crushing elements including

(1) a base (21, 23, 36, 12, 123)
(2) a wear liner (24, 25, 39, 40, 124, 125, 140) detachably mounted on said base and presenting a crushing surface (32, 132, 160) which faces a crushing surface (34, 134, 160) of the other crushing element, said crushing surface (32, 34, 132, 134, 160) of said wear liner having a plurality of cavities (112) cast therein, and
(3) a plurality of inserts (110) fixed in said cavities (112) of said wear liner, and extending from said crushing surface of said wear liner towards the crushing surface of the other crushing element so as to impact and fracture rocks upon operation of said crusher, wherein each of said inserts (110) is formed from a material which exhibits a high resistance to wear and a high resistance to impact when compared to hardened steel,

wherein each of said inserts is press-fit into a corresponding cavity (112) in said wear liner, and

wherein each of said inserts has a fluted outer surface having a maximum diameter which is greater than the diameter of the corresponding cavity before the insert being press-fitted into said cavity.
