<DESCRIPTION>
 D E S C R I P T I O NRICYCLIC OJLJ iroXALDEDIONES AS G O AMATE RECEPTORANTAGONISTSTechnical Field ^ This invention relates to a new class of tricyclic quinoxalinediones which5 are selective antagonists of glutamate receptors such as NMDA (N-methyl-D- aspartate) receptors and AMPA (2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole- propionic acid) receptors. Particularly, the compounds provided by the present invention antagonize the action of glycine at strychnine-insensitive glycine modulatory site of NMDA receptors and therefore, are especially useful for 1 0 minimizing damage of central nervous system induced by ischaemic or hypoxylic conditions such as stroke, hypoglycaemia, cardiac arrest, and physical trauma, (see, J. McCulloch, Br. J. ciin. Pharmacol., 34, 106 (1992)). The compounds are also useful in treatment of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including epilepsy, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease1 5 (reviews: G. Johnson, Annu. Rep. Med. Chem., 24, 41 (1989) and G. Johson and C. F. Bigge, ibid., 26, 11 , (1991)). The present compounds may also have analgestic, antidepressant, anxiolitic, and anti-schizophrenic activities, by virtue of these NMDA-glycine antagonism, as indicated by recent reports, e.g. A. H. Dickenson and E. Aydar, Neuroscience Lett., 121 , 263 (1991), R. Trulias and P.20 Skolnick, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 185, 1 (1990), J. H. Kehne, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 193, 283 (1991) P. H. Hutson, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 103, 2037 (1991), in which the reagents affecting glycine-binding site of NMDA receptors have shown such activities. Excessive release of glutamic acid and/or glycine from synaptosome results in overexcitation of NMDA receptor-Ca2+ channel complexes and25 successive massive amount of Ca2+ influx into the cell, which leads to neuronal* cell death. NMDA-glycine antagonist described in the present invention would obviously regulate the amount of Ca2+ influx from the glycine modulatory site of NMDA receptor-channel complex to maintain normal activities of neuronal cell. 

 Therefore, the compounds of the present invention may be potential therapeutic agents for any diseases of animals including human caused by excessive glutamic acid and/or glycine release in addition to the diseases indicated above. Background Art Nonsubstituted tricyclic quinoxalinediones, 6,7-dihydro-1 H, 5H-pyrido-[1 ,2,3,-cfe]quinoxaIine-2,3-dione and 5,6-dihydro-1 H-pyrrolo[1 ,2,3-cfe-quinoxaline- 2,3-dione are described in A. Richardson, JR. and E. D. Amstutz, J. Org.
