<ABSTRACT>
A method of separating oleophilic-hydrophobic material from wash water is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of mixing with the wash water, either alone or in combination, about 30-2100 ppm of a surfactant having formula (I), where n is 6-20; and about 1-200 ppm of an enzyme selected from the group consisting of proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, pectinases and mixtures thereof. The mixture of wash water surfactant and/or enzyme is then permitted to stand for a time sufficient for the oleophilic-hydrophobic material to separate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the separation of oil from 
wash water. Industrial machines contain metal parts that move "against" one 
another, as for example, gears, drive chains, bearings, etc. To aid the 
movement of these machine parts and to extend their useful life, 
lubricants such as oils and greases are oftentimes utilized. However, 
over a period of time, lubricants begin to lose their effectiveness due to 
the accumulation of dirt and dust, as well as from the severe conditions 
of heat, pressure, and friction, to which the lubricants are oftentimes 
subjected. Additionally, the metal machine parts suffer from wear 
despite the presence of such lubricants. As the metal parts wear, metal 
chippings become dispersed throughout the lubricant further soiling and 
detracting from the useful life of the lubricant. To assure that the  
 
machinery operates at an optimum level, the soiled lubricant must 
eventually be removed and replaced. One such method of removing the soiled lubricant from 
industrial machinery is by cleaning the machinery with an aqueous 
cleaning composition containing a mixture of surfactant and enzyme. 
The waste-product of this cleaning procedure (i.e. the wash water) 
contains the soiled lubricant which consists of oil, grease, dirt, metal 
chippings, and the like, dispersed throughout the aqueous cleaning 
composition. According to prior practice, this wash water was disposed of by 
simply dumping it into the local sewer system. However, local 
ordinances requiring a reduction in the volume of grease, oil and 
insoluble solids discharged into municipal sewers are becoming both 
more stringent and prevalent. Accordingly, it may not be possible to 
dispose of the wash water in the local sewer system. A potential 
alternative to disposing the wash water in the local sewer system is to 
use a waste hauling service. However, where relatively large volumes of 
wash water are generated, it can become prohibitively expensive to have 
it hauled away. Ideally, and in accordance with contemporary industrial 
practice, it would be particularly advantageous if the wash water could 
be treated so that its oil and water components could be recycled. 
Accordingly, there is presently a need for the method of treating wash 
water such that it is recyclable, or in the alternative, more easily and less 
expensively disposed of.  
 It has surprisingly been discovered that treating wash water with 
surfactant and enzyme in appropriate concentrations promotes the 
stratification of the oil
