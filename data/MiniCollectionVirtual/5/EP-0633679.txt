<ABSTRACT>
Intersymbol interference and precoding loss are minimized by combining the precoding 
and coding operations. An intersymbol interference coder uses a feedback loop to apply a 

dither sequence to a sequence of input signal points. The dither signal applied to each input 
signal point is a function of the previous signal points in the sequence. The intersymbol 

interference coder implements, for example, a trellis coding operation by selecting one of 
several different modulo operations to determine the magnitude of the dither signal, the 

selection being made in response to the current trellis state. The sequence of signal points 
output from the intersymbol interference coder generates a valid sequence of the trellis code 

input to the Viterbi decoder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for transmitting data over intersymbol interference
channels and, more particularly, to methods for minimizing the effects of intersymbol
interference on transmitted data.Intersymbol interference results from the fact that a typical communications channel
inherently has memory such that other signals transmitted through the channel interfere with
the current, transmitted signal. Prior techniques for minimizing the effects of intersymbol
interference have involved "preceding" the signal to be transmitted. These prior art
techniques, while allowing both coding and shaping gains on intersymbol interference
channels, provide sub-optimal performance because of the "preceding loss" (i.e., the additional
power that must be transmitted to minimize the effects of intersymbol interference) associated
with these techniques. Because the precoding loss increases when a more powerful trellis
code is used, such precoders cannot approach the channel capacity.One technique for minimizing the effects of intersymbol interference involves
precoding a sequence of signal points to achieve noise whitening on intersymbol interference
channels. This precoding is a nonlinear operation that ensures that the channel output or the
output of a noise whitening filter is a trellis code sequence affected by additive white Gaussian
noise. A so-called "dither signal" is added to each of the signal points in the sequence. No
coding operation (i.e., an operation which achieves coding gain) is performed as part of
precoding. Rather, precoding is performed on a sequence of previously trellis coded signal
points which could be selected from a shaped constellation. Precoding is performed by using
a modulo λ' operation, where λ'is the coset lattice, that is, the lattice in the last level of coset
partitioning used to generate the trellis code. Using this scheme, the preceding loss is large
when the trellis code is based on a large number of coset partitions. The performance of this
scheme degrades with the number of coset partitions used to generate the trellis code. US-A-5 195 107 describes a generalized partial response signaling
(GPRS) technique employed to compensate for intersymbol interference. To this end,
signal points representative of data to be transmitted are selected from a signal
constellation. This signal constellation includes a multiplicity of signal points which are
regularly spaced within a polygonal region having more than four sides. The selected
signal points are precoded by the
