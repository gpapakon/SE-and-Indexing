<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a scaffolding-platform plank (1) made of rectangular lumber with preferably covered ends (3) which are supported on rests of the scaffolding, the invention provides that, essentially over their length between the ends (3) and out of the plane of their flat underside (6), there projects at least one strip or a plurality of strips (4, 5; 14 to 16; 22 to 25), the strips being in parallel arrangement in the latter case, and the strip(s), when the plank ends (3) are supported in the scaffolding, is/are provided as reinforcement against bending when the plants are subjected to loading, and is/are arranged such that it/they serves/serve for support in a stack of a plurality of horizontal planks (1) of the same design located vertically one above the other.

Scaffold plank (1) made of rectangular timber, which comprises profile
strips (14 to 16) essentially protruding from their flat bottom surface over its

length in parallel arrangement, which in supporting the preferably trussed
plank ends in the scaffold serve as reinforcement against deflection of the

loaded plank (1), the profile strips showing a solid profile of timber and a
strip cover profile being provided for improvement of strength, 
characterized
in that
 said profile strips (14 to 16) consisting of timber are glued to one
another such that the profile surfaces (19 to 21) of said strips (14 to 16) are

in line with the plank top side (7) and that an U-profile (41 to 43) serves as
cover profile, said U-profile covering the quadrangular strip cross-sectional

area (39) protruding downwardly, of said profile strip (15) located in the
plane of symmetry on three subsequent, adjacent sides, said profile strips

(14) being arranged such that they serve for support in a pile consisting of
several planks (1) one being perpendicularly arranged on top of the other in

horizontal direction, of identical design.
Scaffold plank as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 three profile strips
(14 to 16) are provided for, which form a structural unit with the plank body

(2) in that they are glued with timber strips (17, 18).
Scaffold plank as defined in one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 with
one of its plane profile surfaces (26a) directed downwardly said profile strips

are mutually aligned and serve as supporting surfaces.
Scaffold plank as defined in one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
ends of the profile strip end at the armatures (31, 32). 
Scaffold plank as defined in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the
ends of said profile strips (4, 5) comprise a chamfering (38) on the armatures

(31, 32).
Scaffold plank as defined in one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 said
profile strips are mounted on the long edges (8, 9) of said plank body (2)

and three profile strips (14 to 19) spaced over the plank width are provided
for.
Scaffold plank as defined in one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 said
profile strips (14 to 16) are mutually connected by one or several cross

brackets (53) spaced from one another.
