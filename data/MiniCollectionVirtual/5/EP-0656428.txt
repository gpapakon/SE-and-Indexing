<ABSTRACT>
A piston for an internal combustion engine, and particularly, but 

not exclusively, for a Diesel engine, has in a region thereof 
reinforcing ceramic fibres, the fibres originally being in the 

form of an insert for the piston with a relatively high density 
in the range 10 to 20% of the density of the fibre material. In 

the fabrication of the piston the insert is infiltrated with 
molten piston material, the piston being formed by employing a 

pressure casting technique, such as squeeze casting. The piston 
material comprises an aluminium alloy with 2.0 to 5.5% by weight 

copper and with 11.0 to 17.0% by weight silicon, and, preferably, 
2.5 to 3.5% by weight copper and 12 to 14% by weight silicon. 

In the fibre-reinforced region the top ring groove of the piston 
is provided, and, possibly, the fibre-reinforced piston region 

provides the peripheral part of the crown surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fibre-reinforced metal pistons
for Diesel engines, and, in particular, the present invention
relates to metal pistons each having reinforcing ceramic fibres
in the region of the piston in which the top ring groove is
provided; and the piston is of a cast aluminium alloy, the metal
having infiltrated the fibre reinforcement when the piston is cast
by employing a pressure technique such as squeeze casting.A ceramic fibre reinforcement increases the strength of a piston
region in which it is provided; and also enables the region to
withstand greater temperatures than otherwise would be the case.
The greater the density of the fibre insert initially included in
the piston region in relation to the density of the fibre material
the stronger the provided region.In operation, or in post-casting heat treatment process steps,
such as solution heat treating and quenching, such a piston may
crack due to differential thermal expansion at the boundary
between the fibre-reinforced region and an adjacent region which
is not so reinforced. This cracking is more likely to occur when
the fibre insert initially included in the former region has a
relatively high density, say, in the range 10 to 20% of the
density of the fibre material.Conventionally the reinforcing ceramic fibres in a piston are of
aluminium oxide and/or of aluminium silicate, and, in the fibre 
insert, before the piston is cast, the fibres have a thin coating
of silica provided by drying an appropriately shaped preform of
the combination of the fibres with a binder system including
silica gel. During the subsequently required pressure casting of
the piston, the molten aluminium alloy comprising the piston
material may react with the silica coated fibre surfaces and
becomes bonded thereto. In any event, micro-shrinkage of the cast
piston material occurs, and this tends to break any bond between
the aluminium alloy and the fibres, or otherwise causes the fibres
to become less securely held in the aluminium alloy. This causes
the wear resistance of the fibre-reinforced piston region to be
significantly lower than otherwise would be the case.Whilst it is known that a relatively high density fibre insert has
been incorporated into a piston so as to provide the crown
surface, previously it has not been considered desirable to
include such a relatively high density fibre insert in the region
of a piston providing a top ring groove because it causes the
machining of the groove to be more difficult, and causes increased
wear of
