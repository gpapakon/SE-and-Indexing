<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stain proofing 
fluorosilicone oil for a heat fixing roller used in 
contact heat fixing apparatus such as a dry system 
electrophotographic copying machine and a printing 
machine. With an electrophotographic copying machine, copying 
is carried out usually in such a manner that a pigment-containing 
thermoplastic resin powder (hereinafter 
referred to as a toner) is used to 
electrophotographically form an image on a photosensitive 
material, and the image is then transferred to a transfer 
paper, whereupon the toner is fixed. As a method for 
fixing the toner, a contact heat fixing system is 
employed in many cases. The contact heat fixing system 
is a method wherein a heat fixing roller and a pressure 
roller are brought in contact with each other under a 
certain prescribed pressure, and the transfer paper is 
permitted to pass between the two rollers, whereby the  
 
toner will melt and fix to the transfer paper. Heretofore, silicone rubber has been used as the 
material for the pressure roller and the heat fixing 
roller. Silicone rubber makes the roller surface elastic 
and thus has a merit that an excellent image quality can 
be thereby obtained. Further, heretofore, it has been 
common to coat a heat resistant elastic material on the 
surface of a pressure roller or to coat a heat resistant 
releasing material on the surface of a heat fixing roller 
in order to make a transfer paper readily releasable from 
the pressure roller or the heat fixing roller. As such a 
heat resistant releasing material, a fluorine resin such 
as polytetrafluoroethylene (hereinafter referred to as 
PTFE) or a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with 
perfluoroalkylvinyl ether (hereinafter referred to as 
PFA) is known. A heat fixing roller coated with such 
material also has an elastic surface and rarely crushes a 
non-fixed toner, and thus has a merit that an excellent 
image quality can thereby be obtained. However, there is a problem that when the toner is 
melt press bonded to the transfer paper by the heat 
fixing roller, a part of the toner supported on the first 
transfer paper sheet will deposit on the surface of the 
heat fixing roller and, when the second transfer paper 
sheet is brought in contact with the heat fixing roller, 
will be transferred to the second transfer paper sheet, 
and at the same time, a part of the toner from the second  
 
transfer paper sheet will deposit on the heat fixing 
roller and will then be transferred to the third transfer 
paper sheet. In the
