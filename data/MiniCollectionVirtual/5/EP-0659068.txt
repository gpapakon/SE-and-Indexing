<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to mouth-care 
products with anti-bacterial activity. More specifically, the 
present invention is related to mouth-care products containing 
an effective amount of at least one lantibiotic and at least 
one compound yielding fluoride ions. Bacteria that are present in the oral cavity lead to 
dental plaque formation. Plaque is considered to be the prime 
etiological factor in the development of caries, and it is 
also implicated in periodontal diseases. Plaque, when not 
sufficiently removed, develops into calculus, a hard, 
mineralised formation which deposits on the enamel surface of 
the teeth. There is also an association between the presence 
of calculus and the incidence of periodontal diseases. Serious 
teeth problems, like caries, gingivitis and other periodontal 
diseases, can be the result of formation of plaque and 
calculus. In the prior art many different lines of approach 
have been used to find solutions to the problems in the field 
of oral care. The first attempts were to remove plaque 
mechanically, using toothbrush and a dentrifice with polishing 
compounds. Abrasive and polishing compounds have many times 
been proposed to help the removal of plaque. US patents 3 927 201 and 3 927 202 describe 
dentifrice preparations comprising alkali metal phosphate 
salts as polishing agents. EP 0 097 476 describes Î²-phase 
calcium pyrophosphates as dentifrice abrasive. According to 
US patent 4 340 583 also silicon dioxide compounds are 
suitable abrasive agents. US patent 3 070 510 discloses 
dentifrice compositions comprising a resinous compound acting 
as an abrasive and US 3 935 304 describes sodium bicarbonate.  
 Regular brushing aids in preventing a rapid build-up 
of plaque, but even regular brushing is not sufficient to 
remove all of the plaque which adhere to the teeth. Antiplaque dentifrice's, based on special chemical 
compounds, has been described next. Examples of these special 
ingredients are quaternary ammonium compounds, described in US 
4 323 551, sanquinarine (GB 2 042 336), Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) 
described in EP 0 161 899, 
p-aminobenzoic acid (US 3 427 380) and many others. As plaque is developed by bacteria in the oral 
cavity, is has been proposed to use bactericides as antiplaque 
agents. The most important ingredient is chlorhexidine, 
described in many patents, for example DE 1 084 876. A 
disadvantage of this compound is the discoloration of the 
teeth. Compounds like bis-biguanides (US 4 067 962) and 
alex
