<ABSTRACT>
To mount an input component (3) of a clutch (1) on the output end (5) of the crankshaft (7) of an internal combustion engine, the invention proposes a press-fit coupling (11), the radial press fit of which is produced by axial forces which are exerted through the hub (21) of a clutch disc (23). This makes it possible to mount the clutch (1), including the flywheel (3) and the clutch disc (23), as a subassembly on the crankshaft (7). The press-fit coupling (11) preferably comprises an expansion element (61), which is, for example, tapered, which is arranged in a central opening (59) in the output end (5) of the crankshaft (7) and which expands the output end (5) radially.
