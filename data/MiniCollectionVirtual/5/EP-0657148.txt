<ABSTRACT>
A breast prosthesis to be worn in the upper part of a bathing suit consists of a soft elastic, shell-shaped plastic body (1) whose rear side facing the body of the wearer has a hollow (3) and at least one reinforcing rib (4a, 4b, 4c) which projects from the surface of the hollow (3). In order that any water which has accumulated in the hollow (3) of the prosthesis while swimming can flow out quickly when getting out of the water and also while swimming, the reinforcing rib (4a, 4b, 4c) extends in a straight line and without interruption between the upper and lower edges of the hollow (3) when wearing the prosthesis.

A breast prosthesis for wearing in the top of a
bathing costume, comprising a soft-elastic dish-shaped

plastic member (1) encased in a polyurethane sheet, the
back of the plastic member (1) facing the wearer's body

having a cavity (3) and a single reinforcing rib (4b),
which projects from the surface of the cavity and

extends in a straight line continuously between the top
and bottom edge of the cavity (3) when the prosthesis

is worn.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 1,
characterised in that the reinforcing rib (4b) has a

longitudinally extending spine (5) which, when the
prosthesis is worn, is deeper at the top end of the

reinforcing rib (4b) than the top end of the prosthesis
when worn and which projects at the bottom end of the

reinforcing rib when the prosthesis is worn, beyond the
bottom edge (2) of the prosthesis when worn and in the

direction of the wearer's body.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 2,
characterised in that spine (5) on the reinforcing rib

(4) is lower in the middle portion of the reinforcing
rib (4) than the upper and side edge of the prosthesis

when the prosthesis is worn.
A breast prosthesis according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the prosthesis

is symmetrical with respect to a central plane (ME) at
right angles to its projected base surface and

extending parallel to the longitudinal direction of the 
wearer's body when the prosthesis is worn, the

reinforcing rib (4b) extending along the central plane
(ME) of the prosthesis.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 4,
characterised in that the base surface has

approximately the shape of an isosceles triangle, the
apices of which are rounded and the base of which has a

convex curvature, and the sides of which include an
angle α of 70° to 90° and the reinforcing rib (4b)

extends along the triangle height line.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 1,
characterised in that the reinforcing rib has a spine

(5) extending in the longitudinal direction of the rib
and having a concave curvature in the central

longitudinal portion of the rib (4b).
A breast prosthesis for wearing in the top of a
swimming costume and comprising a soft elastic plastic

member (1) encased in a polyurethane sheet, wherein the
back of the plastic member (1) facing the wearer's body

has a cavity (3) and a number of reinforcing ribs (4a,
4b, 4c) projecting from the surface of the cavity and

running parallel to one another and extending in a
straight line and continuously between the upper and

lower edge of the recess (3) when the prosthesis is
worn.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 7,
characterised in that the prosthesis is symmetrical

with respect to a central plane (ME) at right angles to
its projected base surface and extending parallel to 

the longitudinal direction of the wearer's body when
the prosthesis is worn, one of the reinforcing ribs

(4a, 4b, 4c) extending along the central plane (ME) of
the prosthesis.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 8,
characterised in that three parallel reinforcing ribs

(4a, 4b, 4c) are provided, the central rib (4b)
extending along the central plane (ME) of the

prosthesis.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 8 or 9,
characterised in that the base surface has

approximately the shape of an isosceles triangle whose
apices are rounded and whose base has a convex

curvature and the sides of which include an angle α of
70° to 90°C and one of the reinforcing ribs (4a, 4b,

4c) extends along the triangle height line.
A breast prosthesis according to any of claims 7
to 10, characterised in that each reinforcing rib (4a,

4b, 4c) has a longitudinally extending spine (5) which
is lower at the top end of the respective rib (4a, 4b,

4c) when the prosthesis is worn than the top edge (2)
of the prosthesis when the prosthesis is worn and, at

the bottom end of the respective rib (4a, 4b, 4c) when
the prosthesis is worn, projects beyond the bottom edge

(2) of the prosthesis when the prosthesis is worn, in
the direction of the wearer's body.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 11,
characterised in that the spine (5) of each reinforcing

rib (4a, 4b, 4c) is lower in the central region of the 
respective reinforcing rib (4a, 4b, 4c) than the upper

and side edge (2) of the prosthesis when the prosthesis
is worn.
A breast prosthesis according to claim 7,
characterised in that each reinforcing rib (4a, 4b, 4c)

has a spine (5) which extends in the longitudinal
direction of the rib and has a concave curvature in a

central longitudinal portion of the rib (4a, 4b, 4c).
