<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with Government support
under GM31299 and GM39558 awarded by the National
Institute of Health, and under AI-22021 and AI-22848
awarded by the National Institute of Arthritis and
Infectious Diseases. The government has certain rights
in the invention.This invention relates to diphtheria toxin.Diphtheria was a leading cause of death among
children until mass immunization against diphtheria toxin
reached the general public in the late 1920's. Current
methods of controlling diphtheria include therapeutic
administration of antibodies as antitoxins that are
specifically directed against the disease itself, and
mass immunization with formaldehyde-inactivated
diphtheria toxin, referred to as toxoid. Although the
latter is capable of inducing specific antitoxin antibody
formation, preparations of the toxoid contain a high
proportion of contaminants (30%-40%) that can be
responsible for occasional adverse effects of
vaccination. (Rappouli, in New Generations Vaccines, ed.
Woodrow, L. Dekker publ. 1990. p. 251-268).Diphtheria toxin is secreted as a single
polypeptide chain of 535 residues from strains of
Corynebacterium diphtheriae lysogenized by a
bacteriophage carrying the tox gene (Greenfield, et al.,
1983, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA80:6853-6857). Mild
trypsinization and reduction of diphtheria toxin in vitro
generates two fragments, Fragment A (N-terminal ∼21K) and
Fragment B (C-terminal ∼37K), as a result of cleavage at
residue 190, 192, or 193 (Moskaug, et al., 1989, BiolChem264:15709-15713; Collier, et al., 1971, Biol Chem,246:1496-1503). A similar proteolytic cleavage
('nicking') occurs in vivo before or soon after the toxin
binds to a sensitive cell (Sandvig, et al., 1981, J Biol
Chem256:9068-9076).The process by which diphtheria toxin intoxicates
sensitive eukaryotic cells involves at least the
following steps: (1) The binding domain of diphtheria
toxin, a region at the C-terminal of Fragment B sometimes
termed the "R region", binds to specific receptors on the
surface of a sensitive cell. Receptors that bind to the
R region are found on many different types of eukaryotic
cells (Middlebrook, J.L., et al., 1977. Can J Microbiol23:183-189.). (2) While bound to its receptor, the toxin
molecule is internalized into an endocytic vesicle. (3)
Either prior to internalization, or within the endocytic
vesicle, the toxin molecule undergoes a proteolytic
cleavage between Fragments A and B. (4) As the pH of the
endocytic vesicle decreases to below 6, the toxin
spontaneously inserts into the
