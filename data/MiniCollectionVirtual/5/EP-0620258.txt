<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to poly(α-olefin)
compositions having enhanced radiation curability to
provide adhesives having a superior balance of peel
adhesion and cohesive strength at both ambient and
elevated temperatures.A continuing need in the pressure-sensitive
adhesive (PSA) art is the achievement of better control
over various mechanical and process properties so that
adhesives can be made specifically for highly demanding
end use applications such as packaging, medical, and
masking tapes. These applications require a proper
balance of properties that changes with the particular
end use.Among the earliest polymers to provide a
reasonable balance of the properties required for
satisfactory PSA performance were the natural and
synthetic rubbers. However, these PSAs had poor aging
properties, and the art quickly recognized the need to
eliminate ethylenically unsaturated groups from the
polymer backbone of rubber adhesives in order to
improve their oxidative stability.The discovery of Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysts made
possible polymerization of α-olefin monomers to high
molecular weights. The homopolymers of the C6-C10
α-olefins were naturally tacky and also had low
toxicity, good aging and favorable environmental
stability (i.e., low oxidation). These homopolymers
were chemically inert, resistant to plasticizer
migration, and relatively inexpensive. However, they
had poor cohesive strength and therefore, lacked the
shear adhesion necessary for high performance PSAs.
Use of ZN catalysts to make homopolymers from α-olefin 
monomers and to make copolymers from mixtures of α-olefin
and nonconjugated polyene monomers is known in
the art and is succinctly summarized in Odian, G.,
"Principles of Polymerization", Ch. 8.4 (Second Edition
J. Wiley & Sons, New York, 1981). For a more detailed
discussion of the polymerization of α-olefins, see
Boor, J., "Ziegler-Natta Catalysts and
Polymerizations", Ch. 19 (Academic Press, NY, 1979).Adhesives derived primarily from C6 or higher
α-olefins are also known. U.S. Patent No. 3,542,717
describes poly(α-olefin) adhesive compositions
comprising mixtures of polyolefin copolymers derived
from olefin monomers with different molecular weights
(i.e., copolymers from one α-olefin monomer having 11
to 20 carbon atoms and another having 4 to 20 carbon
atoms.)U.S. Patent No. 3,635,755 describes polyolefin
PSAs suitable for use as a single component PSA for
surgical tapes that are substantially non-allergenic.
Such adhesives can be made from homopolymers of the C6
to C11 α-olefins or
