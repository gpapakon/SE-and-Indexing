<ABSTRACT>
A spiral member (140) for improving the grip of screws (20) in wooden or other receptive substrates is disclosed. The spiral member (140) has a central axial drive pin by which it can be driven into a thread in the receptive substrate and has an improved cross section providing wings or protuberances (190, 191) extending out past the side surfaces of the cross section. The spiral member (190) has an outwardly facing triangular apex (174) which bites into the old thread whilst the wings (190, 191) bear upon the flanks of the screw thread of the screw inserted (20) into the spiral member (140) improving the grip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to securing screw
threaded devices in receptive substrates and devices for
improving the grip of such devices in receptive
substrates e.g. wood or plastic or composite screw
receivable materials and to restoring the grip of a screw
in a hole made by the screw in such materials after a
period of use. The invention has been developed with the
problems of screw in rail spikes, so called screw-spikes
in mind but is not limited in its capability, it is
believed, only to this application though it will be
specifically described with reference to such an
application.The present invention is an improvement in or
modification of the spiral member adapted for insertion
in a substrate which is disclosed in our European patent
number EP-B-188490.In the earlier application the spiral member is of
constant transverse dimension along its whole length and
is formed as a spiral which has an internal diameter
which tapers slightly but at a constant angle from its
top end to its bottom end. The external diameter
therefore also tapers slightly though arrangements in
which the helix is a constant diameter are included
within the earlier arrangement.The helix or spiral member is of triangular form
with the apex of the triangle pointing outwardly and with
side walls of the triangle straight and the base straight
or of arrow head shape. In the commercial product the
base is curved in a generally elliptical shape. The
lower end of the spiral is turned in across the axis and
then back up the axis to afford a drive pin.The spiral member is inserted into the hole in the 
sleeper by mounting it on an insertion tool which has a
spiral groove in its outer surface in which the spiral
member nests and an axial bore in which the axial drive
pin of the spiral member is located when the spiral
member is fully threaded on to the tool. In this
condition a shoulder on the tool by the bore constitutes
a drive shoulder and the assembly can be readily screwed
into the hole. The spiral member can then be left in
place in the hole by rotating the tool in the opposite
direction. This concept is very effective in enabling a
soft metal, e.g. aluminium, spiral member to be tightly
inserted in the hole and is utilized in the present
invention.Searches of prior art have revealed a number of
inserts proposed for use in reinforcing holes in wood or
metal, as shown in DE 51016 (ADAMS, 1889), DE-C-126935
(THOLLIER, 1901), DE-C-144331 (THOLLIER, 1902), US 730585

<CLAIMS>
A spiral member (140) for increasing the resistance
to pull-out of a screw (20) made of hard material received in

a hole in a body of screw-receiving material which is of
softer material than the screw, the spiral member being

cylindrical or being tapered towards one end and being
turned inwardly at one end or at its narrow end when it

is tapered to afford a drive pin (180) adapted to be engaged by
an insertion tool insertable down the inside of the

spiral member so that the spiral member can be screwed
into the hole from its bottom end, the spiral member

being made of material whose hardness is less than that
of the screw and greater than the hardness of the screw

receiving material and the cross-section of the spiral
member being generally triangular in shape, having a base

surface (173) which faces the axis of the spiral member
and side surfaces (171,172) which face outwardly from the

axis and join at an apex (174), which may be sharp or
rounded, characterised in that the base surface is curved

and extends out in wings (190,191) beyond the side
surfaces (171,172), the side surfaces being straight or

curved and the wings (190,191) being rounded, and in that
the wings are of a shape such as to collapse or fold on

being engaged by the flanks of the screw.
A spiral member as claimed in Claim 1
characterised in that the wings are provided with a neck

portion between the extremity of the wing and the main
body of the spiral member.
A spiral member as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim
2 in which the wings afford a bulbous portion adapted to

engage the flanks of the screw. 
A spiral member as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3
characterised in that notch or groove means are located

in the wings.
A spiral member as claimed in Claim 4
characterised in that the notch or groove means extend

away from the base of the spiral member.
A spiral member as claimed in anyone of Claims
1 to 5 characterised in that the side surfaces curve

outwardly to blend into the wings.
A spiral member as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims characterised in that the ratio of the

maximum axial length (ALm) of the cross-section to the
half-height axial length (AL0.5), namely the length

perpendicular to the median line half way from the apex
of the cross-section to the base of the cross-section,

ALm/AL0.5 is in excess of 1.9:1, and is preferably at
least 2.0:1.
A spiral member as claimed in any one of the
preceeding claims characterised by the following

relationship ALm/Hm
>
AL0.5/H0.5â‰¥AL0.25/H0.25.
A spiral member as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 8 characterised in that the wings afford pointed

structures adapted to bite into the screw receiving
material.
A kit of parts consisting of a screw-spike and
a spiral member as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 9

characterised in that the adjacent turns of the spiral
fit between adjacent threads of the screw spike and the 

wings of the spiral are dimensioned so as to bear
respectively on the inclined upper and lower surfaces of

the adjacent threads.
A kit as claimed in Claim 10 characterised in
that the base surface of the spiral remains clear of the

root of the screw between adjacent threads at least at
the beginning of insertion of the screw into the spiral.
