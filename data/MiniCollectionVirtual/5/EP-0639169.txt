<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorochlorobutenes, 
characterised in that 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane 

is pyrolysed at a temperature in 
the range 500 to 700Â°C. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
1,1,1-trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane mixed with 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,2,2-trichloroethane 

is used. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 2, characterised in 
that it is performed at pressures in the range 0.1 to 

50 bar. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that it is performed in tubes made of inert material. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that residence times of 0.1 to 120 seconds are 

maintained in the region of the pyrolysis temperature. 
A process according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the tubes are filled with inert particulate materials. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the gas mixture emerging from the pyrolysis zone 

is condensed and the hexafluorochlorobutenes contained 
therein are isolated from the condensate by 

distillation.
