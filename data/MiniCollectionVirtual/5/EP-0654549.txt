<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a monofilament and to the resulting 
monofilament. More particularly, this invention relates to 
a method of manufacturing a monofilament possessing 
increased strength, e.g., tenacity, and improved physical 
characteristics such as straight-pull strength and knot-pull 
strength. Methods for making monofilaments that are 
suitable for use as surgical sutures are known and 
generally include the steps of extruding at least one 
bioabsorbable or nonbioabsorbable polymer to provide a 
monofilament, quenching the monofilament to effect its 
solidification, drawing/stretching the solidified 
monofilament to achieve molecular orientation and impart 
high tenacity to the monofilament and annealing the 
drawn/stretched monofilament to relieve internal stresses. 
See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,092,891, 3,106,442, 
3,630,205, 4,911,165, 5,217,485 and U.K. Patent 
Specification No. 1,588,031 and European Patent Application 
No. 415,783. It has been discovered that if in a monofilament 
manufacturing process the monofilament is exposed to 
temperatures ranging from about -50 to about 0°C after 
being drawn or stretched the resulting monofilament will 
exhibit increased strength, i.e., tenacity, and improved 
physical properties such as straight-pull strength and 
knot-pull strength. In accordance with this invention, in a 
continuous monofilament manufacturing process, in which a 
polymer is melt extruded and quenched to provide a  
 
solidified monofilament and the solidified monofilament is 
subjected to stretching and annealing operations to provide 
a monofilament suitable for use as a surgical suture, an 
improvement is provided which comprises exposing the 
stretched monofilament to low temperatures ranging from 
about -50 to about 0°C for periods of time ranging from 
about 0.5 minutes to about 4 hours. The step of exposing 
the stretched monofilament to such temperatures after the 
stretching operation is hereinafter referred to as the 
"cooling" step. The monofilament which is thus exposed can 
be further treated (e.g., stretched or annealed in a manner 
known in the art) to provide a surgical suture exhibiting 
improved physical properties. The monofilament of this invention can be 
employed in the fabrication of medical/surgical devices 
such as monofilament and multifilament sutures; woven, knit 
or braided fabric prostheses; fasteners, meshes, and the 
like. FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an 
apparatus which is suitable for carrying out the
