<ABSTRACT>
The radial jets (28) of a fuel nozzle (22) for the 
combustor (10) of a gas turbine engine are non-axisymmetrically 

disposed around the tip of the fuel 
nozzle (22) to distribute the fuel into the swirler 

unevenly around the circumference to reduce pattern 
factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to combustors for gas
turbine engines and particularly to the fuel nozzles.The fuel nozzles for gas turbine engine combustors
typically include a primary fuel circuit and an
independent secondary fuel circuit where the secondary
fuel circuit is actuated solely during high power engine
operation. As is well known the secondary circuit may
include its own fuel nozzle or may be included in the
fuel nozzle that incorporates the primary circuit. Such an arrangement is disclosed, for example, in FR-A-2 510 657.In the latter configuration, the secondary fuel
circuit has been a single orifice concentric with the
primary circuit orifice and coaxial with the axis of the
tip of the fuel nozzle. Other fuel nozzle configurations
include multiple orifices concentrically and
symmetrically spaced about the axis of the nozzle tip
referred to in the industry as radial jets.Generally, the high power fuel flow enters the
burner through the secondary circuit, which typically
produces a fuel distribution symmetric about the
coincident axes of the air swirler and the fuel nozzle
tip. In all of these secondary fuel circuits, it is
necessary to achieve fuel spray penetration into the
swirling air produced by the fuel nozzle's air swirlers
and to prevent swirler-air-induced collapse of the fuel
spray. The multiple secondary fuel orifices (radial
jets) were an improvement over the single secondary fuel
orifice inasmuch as it improved on these requirements.
Both the single orifice and radial jet configurations
for the secondary fuel circuit, as mentioned above,
produce a fuel distribution just downstream of the fuel
nozzle's air swirler in the form of a symmetrical spray.For a combustor to be efficient and effective the
combusted gas medium must exhibit a desirable pattern 
factor prior to delivering the combusted gas medium to
the engine's turbine. Heretofore, one of the methods of
reducing pattern factor was to incorporate dilution air
holes in the combustor to mix additional air with the
products of combustion. Because of the increasing
amount of air being admitted into the combustor through
the front end, the ability to use the dilution zone air
jets to effectuate the pattern factor is diminishing.
The problem is exacerbated with advanced gas turbine
combustors because of the increased combustor size and
airflow.We have found that we can improve pattern factor
for the advanced gas turbine engines by employing radial
jets in a judicious manner to tailor fuel distribution
during high power so as to lower
