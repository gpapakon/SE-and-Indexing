<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for improving the wettability of silicone-containing 
hydrogel compositions useful for the 
production of biomedical devices, especially contact 
lenses. Hydrogels have been a desirable class of material 
for the preparation of biomedical devices, and have been 
known since at least Wichterle, et al U.S. Patent No. 
3,220,960 which disclosed hydrogels comprising a 
hydrated polymer of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or 
methacrylate crosslinked with a corresponding diester 
(poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, known as poly-HEMA). A hydrogel is a hydrated crosslinked polymeric 
system that contains water in an equilibrium state. The 
physical properties of hydrogels can vary widely and are 
mostly determined by their water content. Since 
hydrogels exhibit excellent biocompatibility, there has  
 
been extensive interest in the use of hydrogels for 
biomedical devices, especially contact lenses. In the field of contact lenses, various factors 
must combine to yield a material that has appropriate 
characteristics. Oxygen permeability, wettability, 
material strength and stability are but a few of the 
factors which must be carefully balanced to achieve a 
useable end-result contact lens. Since the cornea 
receives its oxygen supply exclusively from contact with 
the atmosphere, good oxygen permeability is a critical 
characteristic for any contact lens material. It was discovered that certain crosslinked 
polymeric materials could be hydrated and retain their 
water content. It was further found that the higher the 
water content within contact lenses made from these 
crosslinked hydrogel polymers, the greater was the 
oxygen permeability through the lens to the cornea. High water-containing hydrogels have at times 
exhibited undesirable mechanical properties. For 
example, such hydrogels are often not easily formed into 
hydrolytically stable lenses. Further such materials 
have at times exhibited tearing or other breakage as a 
result of poor tensile strength. What was needed was a 
highly oxygen permeable material that was durable and  
 
highly wettable. Wettability is important in that, if 
the lens is not sufficiently wettable, it does not 
remain lubricated and therefore cannot be worn 
comfortably in the eye. The optimum contact lens would 
have not only excellent oxygen permeability, but also 
excellent tear fluid wettability. Silicone-containing materials were tried as viable 
contact lens materials and displayed very good oxygen 
permeability and durability.
