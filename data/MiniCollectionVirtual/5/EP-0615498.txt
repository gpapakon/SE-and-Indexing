<ABSTRACT>
A pressure-limiting magnetic valve for drive slip controlled braking systems for motor vehicles has a seat valve with a valve seat (14), a valve member (26) and a return spring (27) which holds the seat valve in the open position. The valve member (26) is secured to an axially movable valve slide (21) within the valve housing (10) which is moved into the closed position of the seat valve by an electromagnet (30) when the latter is powered. In the closed position of the valve a pressure-limiting spring is active, setting the valve opening pressure of the seat valve. In order to achieve a simple valve design providing for easy and accurate setting and adjustment, as well as a simplified direct mounting of the magnetic valve, the valve slide (21) is subdivided into coaxial slide elements (22, 23) movable with respect to each other. The first slide element (21) carries the valve member (26) and the other slide element (22) can be driven by the electromagnet (30). The pressure-limiting spring (28) is supported between both slide elements (22, 23).

Solenoid valve with pressure limitation in a 
motor vehicle brake system equipped with slip control, 

having a valve seat (14), surrounding a valve opening 
(40), and a valve element (26), interacting with the said 

valve seat, for releasing and closing the valve opening 
(40), which valve element is fastened on an axially 

displaceable valve tappet (21; 21') and is held in the 
valve-open position by a restoring spring (27), having an 

armature, acting on the valve tappet (21; 21'), of an 
electromagnet (30) for transferring the valve element 

(26) into the valve-closed position and having a 
pressure-limiting spring (28), acting in the valve-closed 

position, for predetermining a valve-opening pressure, a 
pressure which is to be limited being fed through the 

valve opening (40) to the valve seat (14), characterized 
in that the valve tappet (21; 21') is subdivided into two 

tappet elements (22, 23; 22', 23') which are coaxial to 
each other and relatively displaceable, of which the one 

tappet element (23; 23') bears the valve element (26) and 
the other tappet element (22; 22') can be driven by the 

armature of the electromagnet (30), and in that the 
pressure-limiting spring (28) is arranged between the two 

tappet elements (22, 23; 22', 23'), supported axially 
against the latter. 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the valve seat (14) is formed on a valve body (12) press-fitted 

in a sleeve-like valve housing (10), in that the 
tappet element (22; 22'), which can be driven by the 

electromagnet (30), is of an at least partially hollow-cylindrical  
 

design and is guided axially displaceably in 
the valve housing (10), in that the tappet element (23; 

23') bearing the valve element (26) is guided axially 
displaceably in the hollow-cylindrical tappet element 

(22; 22'), in that the restoring spring (27) is supported 
between the valve body (12) and the hollow-cylindrical 

tappet element (22,; 22') and brings the latter to bear 
against the armature (31) of the electromagnet (30) and 

in that the pressure-limiting spring (28), acting between 
the tappet elements (22, 23; 22', 23'), brings the tappet 

element (23; 23') bearing the valve element (26) to bear 
against a stop (38) provided on the hollow-cylindrical 

tappet element (22; 22'). 
Valve according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the tappet element (23; 23'), bearing the valve element 

(26), bears a radially projecting annular collar (251; 
251') and in that the stop (38) on the hollow-cylindrical 

tappet element (22; 22') protrudes into the path of 
displacement of the annular collar (251; 251'). 
Valve according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the stop (38) on the hollow-cylindrical tappet element 

(22') is formed by the annular end face of a tappet guide 
bush (25), press-fitted into the latter, for the tappet 

element (23) bearing the valve element (26), which bush 
is preferably guided axially displaceably in the valve 

housing (10) by a radially projecting annular collar 
(251), protruding out of the hollow-cylindrical tappet 

element (22). 
Valve according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the stop (38) on the hollow-cylindrical tappet element 

(22') is formed by an annular shoulder (243') at the 
transition of two hollow-cylindrical sections (241', 

242') having different clear diameters in the hydraulic 
tappet element (22') and in 
that the tappet element (23') 
bearing the valve element (26) is guided in the hollow-cylindrical 

section (242') having the smaller inside 
diameter and the annular collar (231') of the tappet 

element (23'), bearing the valve element (26), and also 
the pressure-limiting spring (28) are arranged in the  

 
hollow-cylindrical section (241') having the larger 

inside diameter. 
Valve according to one of Claims 3 - 5, characterized 
in that the pressure-limiting spring (28) is 

designed as a helical compression spring which is 
supported against the annular collar (231; 231') of the 

valve tappet (23; 23'), bearing the valve element (26), 
and against a counterbearing (243; 39') in the hollow-cylindrical 

tappet element (22; 22'). 
Valve according to Claims 5 and 6, characterized 
in that the counterbearing for the pressure-limiting
