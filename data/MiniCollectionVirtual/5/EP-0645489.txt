<ABSTRACT>
Multiple-colored textile product (a,g) has two or more 
kinds of dyed portions (b,c,h1-h7) obtained by two or more 

kinds of pigment particle dyeing operations and tieing 
operation in at l
east one of said pigment particle dyeing 
operations. One or more kinds of the dyed portions (b,c,h1-h7) 

are undyed portions which are formed by one or more times of tieing 
operations. The two or more kinds of dyed portions 

(b,c,h1-h7) constitute a tie-dyed pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multiple-colored 
textile products dyed with pigment particles. One of the present inventors previously proposed what is 
called pigment exhaustion dyeing, in which a textile 
product dyed with pigment particles is obtained by 
pretreating a textile product with a cationic nitrogenous 
compound to provide the textile product with substantivity 
for pigment particles. This method is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Nos. 263678/1992 and 33276/1993 and United 
States Patent Nos. 5221288 and 5252103 and other 
publications. As such, pigment exhaustion dyeing is finding 
application to a wide variety of textile products, since it 
does not require strict complicated dyeing conditions as 
in dyeing with conventional dyes and can be performed under 
very easy conditions. However, conventional textile products obtained by 
pigment exhaustion dyeing are limited to those which are 
dyed in a single color over the entire surface, or those 
which are dyed uniformly on the entire surface with both  
 
thermochromic or photochromic particles and an ordinary, 
pigment and which show color changes upon temperature 
changes or according to the absence or presence of light 
irradiation. Against this background there is a need for 
the development of a textile product better in 
fashionability, pattern and color variability and other 
properties. The present invention was developed to provide 
multiple-colored textile products dyed with pigment 
particles to provide patterns and colors rich in 
fashionability and variability. A multiple-colored textile product of the present 
invention has at least three colored portions of different 
colors formed with two or more kinds of pigment particles, 
wherein at least a part of said colored portions 
constitutes a tie-dyed pattern. A high color-deepening 
effect and a color mixing effect are obtained in the dyed portion 
where two or more kinds of pigment particles overlap. Another multiple-colored textile product of the present 
invention has two or more kinds of dyed portions obtained 
by two or more kinds of pigment particle dyeing operations 
and tieing operation in at least one of said pigment 
particle dyeing operations, wherein one or more kinds of 
said dyed portions are undyed portions which are formed by one  
 
or more times of tieing operations so that, said two or more kinds 
of dyed portions constitute a tie-dyed pattern. A high 
color-deepening effect is obtained in the dyed portion 
obtained by two or more times of pigment
