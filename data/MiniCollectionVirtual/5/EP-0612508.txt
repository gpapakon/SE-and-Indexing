<ABSTRACT>
A novel disposable container (20, 20a, 20b, 
20c) and method is used for cleaning or lubricating a 

standard dental handpiece (24). The disposable 
container (20, 20a, 20b, 20c) completely encloses a 

head (28) of the dental handpiece (24). When the 
handpiece (24) is cleaned or lubricated with cleaning 

or lubricating agents, the container (20, 20a, 20b, 
20c) collects cleaning or lubricating agents and any 

other materials (22) that are expelled therewith from 
the handpiece (24) to prevent these materials (22) 

from entering the atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
method for cleaning and lubricating a dental 
handpiece and to an apparatus which may be employed 
in this method. More specifically, the invention 
relates to a disposable container that prevents 
materials that are expelled from the handpiece during 
cleaning or lubrication from entering the atmosphere. Current standards of dental practice require 
sterilization of dental handpieces between patients. 
However, the handpiece must be cleaned before going 
into the sterilizer. This usually includes cleaning 
the turbine and internal parts. In normal 
procedures, a  
 
cleaning fluid is circulated throughout the dental 
handpiece by connecting the handpiece to a suitable 
supply of cleaning fluid and energizing the handpiece. 
The cleaning fluid and any residue which are expelled 
through the head of the handpiece escape into the 
atmosphere. Additionally, after the sterilization of 
the handpiece has been completed, the handpiece will 
usually require lubrication. Again, the handpiece is 
connected to a suitable supply of lubricating fluid and 
energized. Any excess lubricating fluid which is 
expelled through the head escapes into the atmosphere. Dental professionals have started using 
elaborate devices that flush, disinfect and lubricate 
the handpiece. However, this merely creates another 
device which must be cleaned and disinfected or 
sterilized. Furthermore, such devices are often 
expensive. The present invention presents a novel 
apparatus and method intended to minimize these 
problems, as well as to present several other 
improvements.  A general object of the present invention is 
to provide an apparatus and method for cleaning and 
lubrication a dental handpiece. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide an apparatus and method for capturing materials 
expelled from the head of a dental handpiece during 
cleaning or lubrication. Briefly, and in accordance with the foregoing, 
the present invention comprises a novel apparatus and 
method for cleaning and lubricating a standard dental 
handpiece. The apparatus comprises a disposable 
container which completely encloses a head of the dental 
handpiece. When the handpiece is cleaned or lubricated 
with cleaning or lubricating agents, the container 
collects the cleaning or lubricating agents and any 
other materials which are expelled therewith from the 
handpiece and prevents the expelled materials from 
entering the atmosphere.  The features of the invention which are 
believed to be
