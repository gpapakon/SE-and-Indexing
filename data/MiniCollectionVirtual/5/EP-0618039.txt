<ABSTRACT>
The tool (1) for grinding spectacle glasses (10) made of plastic has a spherical cap-shaped surface (2) intended as support (3) for a grinding medium (20). According to the invention, the spherical cap-shaped surface is provided, at least in certain areas, with a covering (21) for the purpose of carrying out a rough-grinding process step, the covering containing abrasively acting hard particles which are anchored in a metallic layer. The abrasive covering (21) is composed in particular of a multiplicity of foil segments (22) which are attached to the support (3).

<CLAIMS>
A tool (1) for polishing spectacle lenses (10) made from
plastics, having a dome-shaped surface (2), which

comprises at least in zones a coating (21) connected
securely thereto with abrasively acting hard particles

and which is provided as a base (3) for a pad-type
abrasive agent (20) for the purpose of performing a fine

grinding step,
characterised in that
 the abrasive coating is intended
for the performance of rough grinding,
in that
 it is formed by a plurality of pad segments (22),
in that
 the segments (22) are manufactured from a sheet
which consists of a metallic matrix with embedded hard

particles,
and in that
 the segments form island-like elements, which
are separated completely or to a large extent by spaces

and which are joined in particular at least partially via
bridge-type connecting points (29) and thus form one or

more groups.
A polishing tool according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the matrix of the pad segments (22)
is made from glass-metal and the hard particles are

present as a primary deposit from the molten mass.
A polishing tool according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 at least some of the pad segments
(22) are constructed shaped as rings.
A polishing tool according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the ring-shaped pad segments (22)
comprise radial, slit-shaped recesses (26). 
A polishing tool according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that
 the abrasive surface coating (21)
is composed of ring-shaped pad segments (22) of the same

size.
A polishing tool according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the pad segments (22) are disposed
hexagonally at least in regions, with the distances

between the centre points of adjacent pad segments being
at least approximately the same.
A method for polishing spectacle lenses (10) made from
plastics, with a tool (1) as specified by one of Claims

1 to 6,
characterised in that
 in a first step rough grinding is
performed with the abrasive coating,
in that
 in a second step a pad-type polishing agent (20)
is applied to the dome-shaped tool surface (2),
and in that
 in a third step fine grinding is performed
with this polishing agent.
