<DESCRIPTION>
The device of this invention resides in the field of guns and
more particularly relates to a lightweight, self-powered, short
recoil-operated 40 mm machine gun for the launching of grenades.40 mm machine guns for launching grenades exist in the prior
art, but they are heavy guns with recoiling masses that are a
small percentage of their total weight. These heavy guns must be
supported by several personnel, and high trunnion forces require
that the gun must be securely mounted. The current state-of-the-art
MK19 40 mm gun has a 17 lb bolt and an assembly weight of 71
lbs. Therefore the recoiling mass of the MK19 represents only 24%
of its assembly weight.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved
grenade launcher in a short recoil-operated machine gun.It is a further object of this invention to provide a machine
gun that is extremely lightweight and man-portable.It is a still further object of this invention to maximize
the gun's recoiling mass as a percentage of the overall gun mass.
The recoiling mass in a grenade launcher is defined as the mass of
those gun components that are set into motion as a direct but
opposite result of the gas pressure acting to push the projectile
down the length of the barrel. Once the recoiling mass is in
motion, it must eventually be arrested and its kinetic energy
absorbed by the non-recoiling mass. In prior art guns the non-recoiling
mass consists of the mass of the gun receiver, charger
system, mount system, and to some extent the gunner. The
rationale for the desired maximization of the recoiling mass
utilizes the First Law of Conservation of Momemtum: M1V1 = M2 V2
which Law indicates that the mass M1 X V1 of the 40 mm projectile
as it exits the barrel muzzle is equal to the total mass M2 X V2
of the recoiling mass. Therefore from this formula if the 
recoiling mass is increased, its velocity will decrease.
The greater the kinetic energy KE of the gun's recoiling
mass, the greater the force required to maintain control of
the gun. The total KE of the recoiling mass is expressed by
the following equation: KE = (1/2) M2V2â€Š2. This relationship
states that one-half the square of the recoil velocity
times the recoil mass equals its kinetic energy. The
lightweight grenade launcher of this invention minimises
the recoil kinetic energy because the recoiling mass is
maximised. Since momentum must be conserved, the recoiling
velocity will decrease and a decrease in velocity will
produce an exponential decrease in KE. The result is a
lightweight grenade launcher

<CLAIMS>
A grenade launcher for the sequential firing of grenade
cartridges comprising:


a barrel (12) having a muzzle end and a breech end,
a bolt (22) having cartridge firing means (84) for firing
a cartridge (16) when the bolt (22) positions such cartridge

(16) in a firing position at the breech end of the barrel (12)
to project a fired cartridge out of the muzzle end thereof,
a receiver (74) for movably retaining the barrel (12) and
the bolt (22),
a feed mechanism to feed cartridges (16) in sequence
towards the firing position, and
recoil transfer and absorption means for transferring and
absorbing momentum generated on firing,

the launcher being characterised by the combination of:

(a) the feed mechanism comprising a rotary feed mechanism
(14) having an aperture defined therein through which the

barrel (12) extends, which mechanism (14) is rotatable around
the barrel (12) and is adapted to receive cartridges (16) in

sequence from a supply, and
(b) the recoil transfer and absorption means including a
toggle link mechanism (17) attached at opposite ends to the

bolt (22) and the receiver respectively and including a main
link (36) having a pivot (38) coupled to the barrel (12) so

that on recoil of the barrel (12) the toggle link mechanism
pulls the bolt (22) away from the firing position to a

retracted position and on counter-recoil returns the bolt (22)
to the firing position.
The launcher according to Claim 1 characterised in that
the toggle link mechanism includes a bolt link (30) pivotally

attached at one end to the bolt (22) and at its opposite end
to the main link (36) and in that the bolt link (30) and the

main link (36) are movable from being aligned with each other
when the bolt (22) is in the firing position to being pivoted

at an angle to each other when the bolt (22) is in the
retracted position. 
The launcher according to Claim 2 characterised in that
the pivot (38) of the main link (36) is positioned part way

along the main link (36) and the end of the main link opposite
to the bolt link is pivotally attached to a control link (42)

which in turn is pivotally attached to the receiver (74).
The launcher according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it also includes:


extractor means (78) on the bolt (22) to pull a cartridge
(16) from the rotary feed mechanism (14), and
means (62) to move a pulled cartridge (16) into the
firing position and to simultaneously eject any spent

cartridge (68) out of the receiver(74).
The launcher according to Claim 4 characterised in that
the means to move a pulled cartridge (16) comprises a feed

lever (62) pivotally mounted on the rear of the bolt (22) and
adapted to push a pulled cartridge (16) downwardly onto a

spent cartridge (68) to eject the spent cartridge (68).
The launcher according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the barrel (12) is longitudinally

movable in the aperture of the rotary feed mechanism (14) and
has a barrel extension (48) extending rearwardly thereof and

the pivot (38) of the main link (36) of the toggle link
mechanism (17) is pivotally secured to the barrel extension

(48).
The launcher according to Claim 6 characterised in that
rotational drive means (50,51,52,56,54) is provided to rotate

the rotary feed mechanism (14), which rotational drive means
is driven by the longitudinal movement of the barrel (12) in

the aperture of the rotary feed mechanism (14).
The launcher according to Claim 7 characterised in that
the rotational drive means comprises a plurality of sets of

interconnected cam paths (50,51,52,56) in the outer surface
of the barrel (12) and cooperating cam follower means (54) on 

the rotary feed mechanism (14) engaging with said sets of cam
paths (50,51,52,56).
The launcher according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the rotary feed mechanism comprises a

feed sprocket (14) having rounded openings around its
periphery for receiving cartridges (16).
