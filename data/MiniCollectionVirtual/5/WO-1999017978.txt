<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sprung track tensioning device (10) for tracked vehicles, intended to be mounted at the rear on a support (16) of a track set of the vehicle. The device comprises an elongate pendulum arm (12), one end portion (14) of which is designed to be fastened pivotably to the support (16) via a first torsion spring (18). The pendulum arm (12) bears a second torsion spring (36) which can be connected to the support (16) via a link arm system (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
TRACK TENSIONING DEVICE FOR TRACKED AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLESThe present invention relates to a sprung track tensioning device for tracked automotive vehicles, which comprises a tension wheel arrangement intended to be mounted at the rear on a support of a track set of the vehicle for supporting track wheel units, which tension wheel arrangement comprises an elongate pendulum arm which has a first end portion arranged so as to support a pivotable rocker arm, in which a tension wheel unit is rotatably mounted, and a second end portion for pivotable fastening of the pendulum arm to the support .SE-C2-504 474 describes a sprung track tensioning device of the abovementioned type, in which the tension wheel unit is mounted on an elongate horizontal pendulum arm, so that, on a spring deflection movement, the tension wheel unit describes a very small movement in the horizontal direction and does not then appreciably influence the geometrical track length and thus the track tension. The track tensioning device also has a short prestressing or torsion arm which, by means of a torsion spring, has a prestressing effect on the rear, free end of the pendulum arm via a force-transmitting rubber element. The torsion arm has a horizontally projected length which essentially corresponds to the horizontally projected length of the pendulum arms of the bearing wheel units, so that essentially the same springing characteristic is obtained for the bearing wheels and the tension wheels when essentially similar torsion springs are used for the respective pendulum arms. In this construction, the pendulum arm for the tension wheel unit must be fastened pivotably to the support (ski beam) a little way in from the rear end of the latter, and the force-transmitting rubber element must be capable of absorbing shearing movements on spring deflection of the tension wheel unit, as the pendulum arms and the torsion arm describe different pivoting paths on spring deflection movements. 

An object of the present invention is to propose a compact track tensioning device that can be mounted on the rear end of the ski beam and afford essentially the same good springing and running characteristics as the abovementioned known track tensioning device but with a shorter construction length.According to the invention, this is achieved by virtue of the features indicated in the characterizing part ofPatent Claim 1. In this arrangement, the elongate pendulum arm is thus fastened to the rear end of the ski beam via a primary torsion spring. As, for
