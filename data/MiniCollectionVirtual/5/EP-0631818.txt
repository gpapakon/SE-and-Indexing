<ABSTRACT>
A waste disposer comprises a shredder section (2) for shredding waste 
material and a water remover section (3) coupled integrally with the 

shredder section for removing water from the waste material, in which 
the waste material is shredded with the shredder section and the 

shredded waste material is carried upward through a cylindrical screen 
member (54) mounted in the water remover section (3) by the rotation of 

a screw (53) provided in the screen member while its water content being 
removed and drained through apertures of the screen member (54) before 

being discharged from the upper end of the screen member. In particular, 
a projecting reflector (62) of an inverted truncated cone with a 

ring-like shape having a downwardly tapered slope arranged on the outer 
side thereof is mounted to the upper end of the screw (53) for narrowing 

the upper opening of the screen member (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waste disposer for 
grinding and removing raw waste material created in a 
kitchen. Waste disposers are commonly used for grinding and removing 
raw waste material produced in kitchens, each comprising a 
shredder for shredding the waste material and a water remover 
for removing water from the shredded waste material which 
both are assembled in a unit. More specifically, such a traditional waster disposer 
comprises a shredder section communicating with a drain 
outlet of a kitchen sink and a water remover section for 
removing water from the shredded waste material. In action, 
raw material is fed into the shredder section of the disposer 
where it is shredded with a supply of water and the shredded 
waste material is transferred into a cylindrical screen 
member of the water remover section where it is carried 
upwards by means of rotation of a screw blade while its water 
content is removed through apertures of the screen member. 
After the removal of water, the shredded waste material with 
a minimum of water is disposed from the upper end of the 
screen member to drain. However, the traditional waste disposer has a gap between the 
upper end of the screw blade and the inner wall of the 
cylindrical screen member. This causes water fed by rotation 
of a motor to the shredder section and moved into the screen 
member of the water remover section to overflow from the 
upper end of the screen member through the gap. Accordingly, 
the overflow of waste water will contaminate peripheral 
regions of the disposer and produce odor.  It is an object of the present invention to eliminate the 
foregoing disadvantage. More particularly, the object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved waste disposer in which a projecting 
reflector of an inverted truncated cone ring-like shape 
having a downwardly tapered slope arranged on the outer side 
thereof is provided on the upper end of a screw which carries 
shredded waste material upwards through a screen member for 
removing water in a water remover section so that the 
shredded waste material is blocked and squeezed by the 
projecting reflector to close or narrow the upper opening of 
the screen member during its upward movement. Accordingly, a 
flow of water transferred from a shredder section to the 
water remover section is hindered by the shredded waste 
material aggregated at the upper end of the screen member 
thus staying inside and hardly overflows from the upper end 
of the screen member. Hence,

<CLAIMS>
A waste disposer comprising a shredder section communicating 
with a drain hole of a sink in a kitchen for shredding waste 

material, a water remover section coupled integrally with the 
shredder for removing water from the waste material, in which 

waste disposer the waste material is fed together with a 
supply of water into and shredded within the shredder 

section, and the shredded waste material is carried upward 
through a cylindrical screen member mounted in the water 

remover section by the rotation of a screw provided in the 
screen member while its water content is removed and drained 

through apertures of the screen member before being 
discharged from the upper end of the screen member; said 

screw of the water remover section having a projecting 
reflector of an inverted truncated cone with a ring-like 

shape mounted to the upper end thereof, and said projecting 
reflector having a downwardly tapered slope arranged on the 

outer side thereof for narrowing the upper opening of the 
screen member.
