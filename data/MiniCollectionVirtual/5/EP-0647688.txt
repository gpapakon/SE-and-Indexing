<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conductive coating composition 
comprising a graphite intercalation compound. This application has been divided out of European Patent Application No. 
88309017.7. A conductive coating composition known in the art comprises a fine powder 
having in itself electrical conductivity, e.g., metals such as silver, copper and 
nickel, or graphite and carbon black, dispersed in various binders and solvents. When the metallic fine powder is used, an electrical conductivity of about 
10⁻⁵ Ω.cm in terms of volume specific resistance is obtained. However, silver is not 
only remarkably high in the price per unit weight of the composition but also 
undergoes large price changes. The powder of the other metals brings about a 
chemical change, such as oxidation, and further no sufficient measure has been taken 
against the occurrence of a migration phenomenon wherein the fine metallic powder 
migrates between adjacent coating films. Although a coating composition containing carbon black dispersed therein 
brings about no problem accompanying the use of the fine metallic powder, the 
electrical conductivity is not very high and is, at best, 10⁻² Ω.cm. It is known that a conductive coating composition prepared by graft 
polymerising various monomers in a solvent and dispersing carbon black therein is 
mixed with a silver dispersion coating composition for the purpose of preventing the 
migration of silver in a coating composition containing silver dispersed therein.  
 
However, this expedient is disadvantageous in that the conductive coating 
composition is poor in the compatibility with the silver dispersion coating 
composition. On the other hand, as is known, a graphite intercalation compound 
(hereinafter abbreviated to "GIC") comprises graphite and various metals or 
compounds intercalated between crystalline layers of the graphite. Known metals which are intercalated into graphite include alkali metals 
such as Li, Na, and K and known compounds which are intercalated into graphite 
include metal halides such as SbF₅, CuC1₂, NiC₂, and FeC1₂ and acid 
compounds such as HNO₃, and H₂SO₄. The above-described GIC has attracted 
attention as a substitute for metals because it has excellent electrical conductivity, 
and various processes for preparing GIC are known. For example, GIC wherein a 
metal chloride is intercalated is prepared by the following process (a) or (b). 
(a) A process in which a mixture of an anhydrous metal chloride with 
graphite or a mixture of a molten salt of a
