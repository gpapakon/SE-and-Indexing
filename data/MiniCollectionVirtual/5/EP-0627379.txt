<ABSTRACT>
To prevent the displacement of a sheet finisher (12) coupled to a printing machine or copying machine (10), a device is proposed for transferring stacks of sheets emerging from the printing machine or copying machine (10) towards the stack-finishing machine (12). The printing machine or copying machine (10) has a door (14) with an opening for ejecting the stacks and the said sheet finisher (12) has an entry side opposite this opening, this door (14) opening towards the entry side of the sheet finisher (12). The device comprises a conveyor (16) articulated in a frame (18) integral with the sheet finisher (12) about a horizontal shaft (A) and having a length such that its free end, during a pivoting of the conveyor (16) from a low position adjacent to the said ejection opening towards a raised position, follows a path not obstructed by the said printing machine or copying machine (10), the said door (14), in the raised position of the said conveyor (16), being capable of being opened freely without displacement of the said sheet finisher (12).
