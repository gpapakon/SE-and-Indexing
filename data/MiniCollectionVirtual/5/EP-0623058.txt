<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of producing a rotary dispersion member comprises providing a frusto-conical form (23) with a cylindrical base (25), operating a cutting wheel (27) to cut a groove (28) in the form (23) by moving the cutter along a line (29) parallel to the side of the frusto-conical form until the straight part of the groove is cut to full depth and then moving the cutter away from the form at 90 DEG to its central axis (34), the end of the groove thereby being formed as arcuate, grinding away the periphery of the base (25) until the outer generated curve (32) is at the required angle to a surface normal to said axis (34), mounting the worked form on a plate (36) to produce one part of a mould tool, fitting the one part in another mould tool to define a cavity therebetween, and injecting material into the cavity. The resultant dispersion member can be formed with known teeth by spark eroding said another mould tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary atomisers of the 
kind which include a rotary dispersion member in the form 
of a hollow truncated cone having a central region with a 
peripheral frusto-conical wall inclined outwardly of the 
central region, the inner surface of the wall being 
formed with grooves, each of which is symmetrical and 
extends radially outwardly from the central region to an 
innermost free edge of the wall. Such a rotary 
dispersion member will hereinafter be referred to as 
being of the kind specified. An outermost edge of the 
wall is usually formed with radially outwardly projecting 
teeth, each having an apex and a root, the teeth being 
disposed at the same angular spacing as the grooves and 
aligned along a radius of the dispersion member, so that 
an apex of each tooth is in alignment with a base of a 
corresponding groove. Rotary atomisers have been used successfully for 
some years as a way of atomising liquids where it is 
necessary to control the range of spray droplet sizes 
produced for greater accuracy in liquid application 
and/or to reduce the volumes of spray liquid required. 
Such applications are the atomisation of pesticides 
(including herbicides) in agriculture, horticulture, and 
amenity situations, the atomisation of water for 
humidification/dust suppression and the accurate 
application of special additives in various applications 
such as paper making. Rotary atomisers consist typically of a rotating 
dispersion member which may be of a simple flat disc 
form. The rotary member can be driven by any suitable 
means such as an air or hydraulic motor, electric motor 
(A.C. or D.C.), either directly or indirectly via gears  
 
or belts and pulleys, a propeller in an air stream, or a 
turbine. The speed of the rotating member can be in the 
range 0-100,000 r.p.m. The liquid to be atomised is then 
fed through a flow calibration orifice onto the rotating 
disc. The liquid travels to the edge of the disc and 
centrifuged from it as discrete droplets (either directly 
or from the break-up of liquid ligaments formed at the 
disc edge). One problem with these basic simple forms is that 
if the edge of the disc is plain, the surface tension of 
the liquid is sufficient to prevent the liquid leaving 
the edge in anything other than the random break up of a 
sheet of liquid if not at equilibrium of liquid flow rate 
and disc speed. The addition of tooth-like pointed 
serrations acting as zero issuing points as described in 
a paper by Bals. 'Design of rotary atomisers'

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a rotary dispersion member (51) in the 
form of a hollow truncated cone having a central region (19) and a 

peripheral frusto-conical wall (20) inclined outwardly of the central 
region, the wall having an inner surface and an innermost free edge, 

grooves (21) formed in said inner surface of the wall, each groove having 
a required width, being symmetrical and extending radially outwardly 

from the central region to the innermost free edge of the wall, the 
grooves having respective end parts at said innermost free edge of the 

wall, the respective end parts (21a) of the grooves being arcuate with the 
remaining parts of the grooves respectively being straight, extending from 

said central region, the method being characterised by the steps of 
providing a form (23) having at least part of its external shape as a 

truncated cone having a frusto-conical side surface (24), providing one or 
more cutters (27) each with a cutting face corresponding to an inclined 

angle required as the angle of at least part of each of said grooves of the 
rotary dispersion member, cutting at least part of said straight part of a 

first groove in the form by moving one or more of said cutters along a 
line or lines (29) parallel to said frusto-conical side surface, and moving 

one or more of said cutters at a side of said line or lines remote from 
said form to cut at least part of said arcuate end part of the first groove in 

the form if not cut during cutter movement along said line or lines, the 
cut straight and arcuate end parts of the first groove meeting to form a 

continuous radial first groove, carrying out said cutting process to 
provide a further such continuous radial groove angularly spaced from 

said first groove around the frusto-conical side surface of the form by a 
distance corresponding to the required width of a groove in the rotary 

dispersion member, removing material from a wider end of said form 
around the whole of its periphery until an end of an outer generated  

 
surface (32) of the arcuate end part of each groove is at a required angle 

to a surface (33) normal to a central axis (34) of rotation of the form, said 
form then constituting said one part of the mould tool, providing another 

part (37) of said mould tool in the form of a cavity part, placing said 
mould parts together and moulding said rotary dispersion member 

therebetween, with said respective end parts of the grooves thereof being 
arcuate at said innermost free edge of the frusto-conical wall. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said movement of 
one or more of said cutters along a line or lines parallel to said frusto-conical 

side surface cuts the whole of said straight part of the first groove 
in the form. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said movement of 
one or more of said cutters also cuts the whole or substantially the whole 

of said arcuate end part of the first groove in the form. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
form (23) has a radially outwardly extending part (25) at the wider end of 

its truncated cone, the method including the step of removing material 
from said radially outwardly extending part around the whole of its 

periphery until the end of the outer generated surface of the arcuate end 
part of each groove is at the required angle to a surface normal to a 

central axis of rotation of the form, said form then constituting said one 
part of the mould tool. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein material is removed 
by grinding in a direction normal to said central axis.  

 
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein said movement of 
one or more of said cutters is to a position at which the end of the 

straight part of a groove is cut to full depth, all or substantially all of said 
arcuate end part being in said radially outwardly extending part of the 

form. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, wherein a 
tooth form (38) is produced in said cavity part to provide the rotary 

dispersion member with radially outwardly projecting teeth (22) at an 
outermost edge of the frusto-conical wall. 
A method as claimed in Claim 7, wherein the tooth form (38) is 
produced so that each tooth has an apex and a root, the teeth being 

disposed at the same angular spacing as the grooves and aligned along a 
radius of the rotary dispersion member, so that an apex of each tooth is 

in alignment with a base of a corresponding groove. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, comprising cutting said 
straight part of the first groove by moving the cutter along said line in a 

direction from a narrower end of the truncated cone form to said 
position spaced therefrom, and then moving the cutter away from the 

form in a direction normal to a central axis of rotation of the form. 
A method as claimed in Claim 9, comprising indexing the form 
by a selected number of degrees and repeating the cutting to form a 

series of grooves around the frusto-conical side surface.
