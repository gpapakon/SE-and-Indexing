<ABSTRACT>
An improved lift creating sail and sail system where a substantially rectangular mainsail (2) made up of panels forms an aerodynamically efficient airfoil that is supported at approximately its center on a pivot so that is has three degrees of freedom. The mainsail can be tilted at hartships, rotated along a yaw axis, and tilted for and aft to create lift and minimum drag. An optional jib  sail (3) that can track the motion of the mainsail also produces lift. The mainsail (2) and jib sail (3) can be trimmed and positioned along three degrees of freedom to obtain maximum lift and minimum drag as well as a stable system. The effect of this sail system is to increase the speed of the boat by 15-25 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionLIFT CREATING SAIL AND SAIL SYSTEMTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to the field of sails and sail boats and more particularly to a mainsail that can create lift and a sail system of a mainsail and a jib sail that together create lift and increase the speed of a sailboat by 15-25%.Background ArtA sailboat is propelled by wind impinging on a sail to create thrust (a forward force vector). A typical sail however, also creates drag (an aftward force vector) tending to cancel thrust. In addition, the boat's hull creates considerable drag as it passes through the water. The magnitude of the total drag force is proportional to boat's velocity and is related to the amount of the hull under water, the exact shape of the hull, the size and shape of the sail, and other factors. If a sail system can create lift (an upward force vector) as well as thrust and drag, the hull is pulled more out of the water (called a reduction in heeling) . This effect can considerably reduce drag caused by the hull. Since hull drag is the major component of drag, the speed of the boat can be substantially increased. Also, if airflow over the sail can be optimized, sail drag is decreased as well resulting in further increases in speed.Prior art systems for achieving lift on a sailboat have operated off of a single mainsail attached to a mast that could be tilted such that the top of the sail moved windward of the centerline of the boat. The idea was to incline a conventional sail athwartship so that the top of the sail moves into the wind producing lift as well as thrust. However, simply tilting the sail causes an undesirable side effect called "lee helm." This is a tendency for the boat to try to turn away from the wind requiring the continuous use of rudder to maintain a heading. This use of rudder causes extra drag slowing the boat. "Lee 

helm" is actually caused by a resultant force moment created by the center of pressure in the sail being windward of the centerline of the boat. In order to counter "lee helm" some prior art systems tilt the sail aft as well as athwartship to achieve a canceling moment.Prior art systems all attach the base of the mast to either a flexible joint on the centerline or to a straight or curved track running athartship. This has the disadvantage of not being able to position the sail at an optimum angle with respect to the wind for maximum lift and minimum drag. Prior art systems also use conventional triangular sails which are also not optimum for producing maximum lift.

270 7. The lift-creating sail system according to claim 3 further comprising an air-gap between fore and aft panels of said mainsail for airflow optimization.
8. A sail system for a sailboat that creates lift as well as thrust and drag, the improvement comprising, a substantially
275 rectangular mainsail, and a substantially triangular jib sail; the mainsail made of panels with an air-gap located between fore and aft panels to optimize airflow across the mainsail, the mainsail attached near its midpoint to an A-frame which itself is firmly attached to the boat; the mainsail attached in a manner
280 that allows it to pivot with three degrees of freedom being able to be set to create optimum lift and thrust for any wind; the jib sail mounted forward of the mainsail, its top attached to the A-frame where the mainsail is attached, the jib sail being coupled to the mainsail so that it tracks athartship motion of
285 the mainsail also creating lift and thrust, the jib sail and the mainsail both being ajustably free to assume any yaw angle with respect to the boat, the mainsail also being free to tilt fore and aft to any angle with respect to the boat, the sail system being trimmed to capture a desired amount of wind creating
290 optimum lift and thrust for wind and sea conditions and desired boat speed.
