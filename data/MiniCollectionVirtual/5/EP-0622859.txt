<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a combined charging and fluid connection device for connection of an accumulator having electrolyte circulation to an electrical power and fluid supply unit, having a plug (1) and a socket (3) which are each provided with an electrical connection and a fluid connection (8, 10, 20, 21, 30, 38) which can be coupled to one another. The plug has two guide grooves (22), which are arranged parallel to one another and into which guide webs (36) engage which are arranged in a protective collar (6) on the socket (3). The connection device according to the invention is intended to be capable of being combined with known connection devices. This is achieved in that the guide webs (36) have a tubular attachment (40) at the free end of the protective collar (6) and a fluid channel (37) which extends in the longitudinal direction of the guide webs (36) and opens on the one hand into the fluid connection (38) of the socket (3) and on the other hand into the tubular attachment (40). The plug housing (2) in this case has a fluid channel (29), which merges at one end into the fluid connection (30) of the plug (1), in each case at that end of the guide grooves (22) which faces away from the free end of the connection attachment (5). The tubular attachments (40) on the guide webs (36) engage in a sealing manner in the through-hole in the plug housing (2) when the plug (1) and socket (3) are mated.
