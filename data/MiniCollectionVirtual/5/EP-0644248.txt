<ABSTRACT>
A liquid sorbent article comprising at least one 
layer of sorbent fibrous material and at least one hinge 

about which the article may be preferentially folded, 
the hinge being formed by permanently bonding fibres of 

said layer under pressure along a line. The sorbent 
material preferably comprises melt blown microfibres of 

polypropylene and the hinge is formed by a pressure weld 
from a blunt slitter roll.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to articles for 
containment and management of liquid spills and 
particularly to articles for containment, removal and 
recovery of liquid spills encountered in a manufacturing 
environment. A variety of materials, delivered in numerous 
configurations, have been used for the management of 
liquid spills in manufacturing environments. These 
materials include granular absorbents, sheet and roll 
goods, and boom configurations consisting of a casing 
filled with particulate sorbent products such as clay, 
cellulose, chopped corn cobs, or chopped microfibrous 
materials. Several types of sorbent products are 
typically used at location because no one sorbent 
product is adaptable to the many spill situations 
encountered in a manufacturing environment. Historically, loose granular clay particles have 
been the principal material used for spill management 
activities in a manufacturing environment. Clay 
particles were preferred because they were economical, 
capable of sorbing both oil or water based spills, 
easily applied to a spill and readily adaptable to a 
variety of situations such as spills on irregular 
surfaces or in minimal clearance situations (i.e., under 
machines). In spite of these advantages, clay particles 
have disadvantages in that they are easily tracked to 
locations adjacent the spill site and the cleanup 
operation is labour intensive, requiring brooms, 
shovels, dustpans and a variety of containment vessels. The use of loose granular materials have been 
declining with the introduction of "dimensioned" sorbent 
articles, i.e., sheets or rolls of sorbent materials or 
booms consisting of porous casings which are filled with 
loose granular sorbent materials. Dimensioned sorbent 
articles offer the convenience of easy placement, the  
 
ability to deliver a larger mass of sorbent material to 
the spill site in a smaller volume than would be 
required with loose materials, less mess than loose 
granular materials and a cleanup that is considerably 
less labour intensive than with loose granular 
materials. The liquid holding capacity of sorbent articles 
used in spill management activities is an important 
factor in the selection of sorbent articles as it is 
desirable to contain, remove and recover spilled liquids 
using the minimum amount of sorbent material. Equally 
important, however, is the rate at which the sorbent 
article picks up or sorbs the liquid spill. Rapid, high 
capacity pickup of a liquid spill provides improved 
safety and higher

<CLAIMS>
A liquid sorbent article comprising at least 
one layer of sorbent fibrous material and at least one 

hinge about which the article may be preferentially 
folded, the hinge being formed by permanently bonding 

fibres of said layer under pressure along a line. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in Claim 1 
in which the fibres are bonded by welding. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in Claim 2 
in which the fibres are bonded by pressure welding. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in any 
preceding Claim comprising at least two contiguous 

layers of sorbent material bonded to each other by a 
plurality of said hinges. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in Claim 4 
in which the layers are additionally bonded at one or 

more edges of the article. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in Claim 5 
in which two parallel edges are bonded and the article 

comprises a plurality of straight hinges parallel to 
said bonded edges. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in any one 
of Claims 1 to 5 in which the welds forming the hinges 

have a substantially sinusoidal or zig-zag 
configuration. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in any one 
of Claims 4 to 7 which additionally comprises a mesh 

sandwiched between said layers, said layers being bonded 
through said mesh to form a hinge. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in any one 
of Claims 4 to 7 which additionally comprises 

particulate material positioned between said contiguous 
layer, said particulate material being selected from 

absorbents, indicators, neutralisers and combinations 
thereof. 
A liquid sorbent article as claim in any 
preceding Claim in which the sorbent fibrous material 

comprises blown microfibres. 
A liquid sorbent article as claimed in Claim 
10 in which the fibres are of polypropylene. 
A method of making an article as defined in 
Claim 1 which comprises passing at least one web of 

sorbent material between a blunt slitter roll and a 
solid support to effect a pressure weld along a line 

thereby forming a hinge. 
A method of making an article as claimed in 
Claim 12 in which a plurality of contiguous webs are 

passed through said blunt slitter. 
A method of making an article as claimed in 
Claim 13 in which two contiguous layers of sorbent 

material are passed through a slitter apparatus 
comprising two cutting slitter rolls spaced apart and at 

least one blunt slitter roll positioned therebetween. 
A method of making an article as claimed in 
Claims 12 to 14 in which the sorbent material comprises 

blown microfibres. 
A method of making an article as claimed in 
Claim 15 in which the fibres are polypropylene.
