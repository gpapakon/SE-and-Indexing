<ABSTRACT>
Novel epoxyacrylates and carboxyl-containing epoxyacrylates of the formulae III and IV of the patent claims, which have a relatively high molecular weight, are photochemically crosslinkable and can be used in photoresist formulations without the additional use of high-polymeric binder polymers; such resist formulations are used in particular in the area of circuit boards and printing plates, can be applied in aqueous form, have virtually no tack, and have very good edge coverage, in particular on conductor tracks.
