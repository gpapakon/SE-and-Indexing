<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of measuring
internal information of a scattering medium. Embodiments of
the invention relate to non-invasive
measurement of internal information in a scattering
medium by causing pulsed light, square wave light, or
continuous light to be incident on a scattering medium
such as a living body, and detecting light propagating
in the scattering medium and more particularly, to a
method for measuring internal information in a
scattering medium and an apparatus for the same, which
are capable of measuring a ratio of absorption
coefficients and a ratio of concentrations of specific
absorptive constituents in the scattering medium, its
time change, its spatial distribution, and the others,
and which are capable of improving measurement
precision.Demands for measurement of an absorption
constituent in a scattering medium such as a living
body or improvement of the measurement are very
strong, and there are several reports and attempts
therefor. Main prior arts will be represented as
references1-5) at the end of this section (the number of 
each reference will be referred to with a superscriptx)
hereinafter).In general, since light is scattered and/or
absorbed at random in the scattering medium, light
does not propagate straight. For the scattering
medium in which the absorption is zero, a total
quantity of light never decreases, but since light is
scattered by scattering constituents at random, light
propagates zigzag. In this case, a distance that
light can propagate without the effect of the
scattering is called a mean free path or a mean
diffusion length, which is an inverse of a transport
scattering coefficient µs'. In the case of the living
body specimen, the mean free path is about 2 mm1). In
addition, the scattering medium comprises absorptive
constituents other than the scattering constituents,
so that the absorption occurs in accordance with a
distance that light propagates while scattering, and
the quantity of light is exponentially attenuated in
accordance with the distance.As the prior arts in the field of the precise
measurement of an absorption coefficient or a
transport scattering coefficient of a scattering
medium, one is to measure quantity of transmitted
light or reflected light corresponding to continuous
light or pulsed light incidence, and one is to measure 
transmitted light or reflected light corresponding to
pulsed light incidence and to analyze its waveform.
The former utilizes a measurement of the absorbance
in which Lambert-Beer Law is a basic
