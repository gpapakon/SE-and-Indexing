<ABSTRACT>
The invention is drawn to novel amphetamine derivatives set forth which are covalently attached to antigenic carrier proteins or polypeptides for the preparation of antibodies or receptors to amphetamine and amphetamine metabolites. Further, the novel amphetamine derivatives covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels or the antibodies or receptors may be used in immunoassays of the amphetamine and/or amphetamine metabolites.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONNovel Amphetamine Derivatives and Protein and Polvpeptide Amphetamine DerivativeConjugates and LabelsField of the InventionThis invention is in the field of ligand receptor assays, including immunoassays, for the detection of selected metabolites of amphetamine and metha phetamine (amphetamine) in a fluid sample. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for the synthesis of novel amphetamine derivatives and protein and polypeptide amphe¬ tamine derivative conjugates and labels for use in the preparation of antibodies to amphetamine and amphetamine metabolites and for use in the immunoassay process.Background of the InventionAmphetamine and methamphetamine stimulate the central nervous system and have been used medicinally to treat hypotension, narcolepsy and obesity. Because of their stimulating effects the drugs and derivatives have been abused. The illicit use of amphetamine and amphet¬ amine analogues, such as p-methoxyamphetamine, ethylene- dioxyamphetamin , 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, 2,4 ,5-trimethoxyamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymeth- amphetamine has resulted in a medical need for antibodies and diagnostics to rapidly detect the amphetamine metabo¬ lites in order to monitor and treat amphetamine addiction. The preparation of antibodies to amphetamine requires the synthesis of an amphetamine derivative in order to covalently attach the derivative to an antigenic polypep¬ tide or protein. In addition, the amphetamine derivative is covalently attached to various polypeptides, proteins or labels for use in screening antibodies and in the immunoassay process. The amphetamine derivative should mimic the structure of the amphetamine metabolite sought 

to be measured. Therefore, the selection and synthesis of the types of amphetamine derivatives for covalent attach¬ ment to proteins, polypeptides or labels is critical. In addition, the amphetamine derivatives need to be stable to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution.Summary of the InventionThe present invention is directed to novel ampheta¬ mine derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies to amphetamine and amphetamine metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.DefinitionsIn accordance with the present
