<ABSTRACT>
The casing (14) of a well is perforated using a 
perforating gun (36) suspended offset from a production 

string (18), the gun being actuated by a wireline kickover 
tool contacting a detonator housed in a side pocket. The 

perforation is preferably effected with the well bore in 
underbalance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and 
apparatus for well perforation and completion. Oil and gas wells are completed with a string of 
tubular steel casing which is cemented in place. When 
properly placed and cemented in the well bore, the casing 
protects freshwater reservoirs from contamination, supports 
unconsolidated rock formations, maintains natural separation 
of formations, aids in the prevention of blowouts and waste 
of reservoir energy, and acts as a conduit for receiving 
production tubing through which formation fluids are brought 
to the surface. In some wells, the well casing intersects multiple 
producing formations which are confined vertically between 
multiple layers of underburden and overburden, typically of 
impervious siltstone or other barren rock. Consequently, 
each producing formation must be produced separately. To 
make this possible, the well casing must be perforated at 
separate locations which coincide with the discrete 
producing zones. Additionally, the different producing 
zones must be isolated with respect to each other by 
packers installed within the casing bore below and above 
each producing zone. Gun perforation is a method for providing a well 
bore - reservoir connection by forming holes through the 
casing and into the surrounding formation. Two conventional  
 
perforating methods are bullet perforating and jet 
perforating. In both methods, the gun is fitted with 
barrels which contain the perforating apparatus. Each 
barrel is wired for firing by remote control from the 
surface. The gun is run into the well bore on a wire line 
from a service truck. The wire line lowers and raises the 
gun in and out of the hole, and when the gun is in position 
to be fired, the operator sends an electric impulse down the 
wire line to trigger detonation. The bullet or perforating 
jet punches a hole through the steel casing, the cement 
sheath, and several inches (one inch is 2.54 cm) into the 
surrounding reservoir, thus creating a flow passage from the 
reservoir into the well bore. Guns of the bullet type are 
retrievable and are reloaded at the surface. Many jet type 
guns are expendable and disintegrate upon detonation, 
although some types are retrieved and either reloaded or 
discarded. After the perforations have been formed, well 
completion continues with the installation of production 
tubing, isolation packers, a safety valve, and circulation 
tools such as sliding side door circulation valves for gas 
wells, and screens for oil wells. After
