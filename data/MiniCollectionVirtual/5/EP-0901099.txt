<ABSTRACT>
A portable terminal having an integrated circuit, a
data transceiver, and a magnetic element. The integrated

circuit stores data and/or effects operations. The data
transceiver transmits and receives data respectively to and

from external terminals. The magnetic element, which is
comprised of a soft magnetic material, undergoes abrupt

magnetization reversal when applied with an external
alternating magnetic field, and outputs an inherent signal as

a security signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable terminal
having security or identification capability. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a portable
terminal for remotely transmitting and receiving data
respectively to and from external host terminals. The
present invention also relates to a method for identifying
terminals using abrupt magnetization reversal, as an inherent
signal, output by a magnetic element when the element is
under the influence of an externally applied alternating
magnetic field. Incidentally, in the present invention,
meaning of the portable terminal includes a wireless
communication terminal, a non-contact IC card and the like.There are many known portable, small-sized terminals
for dealing with money, membership, qualification, etc. An
example of such a well known terminal is a magnetic card. In
recent years, a new terminal, which has been replacing the
magnetic card, is a so-called IC card having an integrated
circuit such as microcomputer and memory incorporated 
therein. These IC cards have been used in various fields
such as traffic, finance, medical treatment and utility.
Among these IC cards, a portable terminal that allows remote
transmission and reception of data with data processing
terminals has been expected to be extremely convenient.Such a wireless, portable terminal is an IC having an
antenna used for transmission and reception of data signals
with data processing terminals, thereby allowing for remote
sensing. At present, such a non-contact is available in a
close-contact type that communicates with data processing
terminals at a distance of up to about 2 mm, a proximity type
that communicates with data processing terminals at a
distance of up to about 1 m, and microwave type that
communicates with data processing terminals at a distance of
several meters. Unlike a contact IC card, such a portable
terminal requires no electrode and is thus highly reliable.
Further, such a portable terminal is advantageous in that
since it has no driving portions such as a conveying
mechanism, its reader and writer are maintenance-free. The
antenna element to be incorporated in such a portable
terminal is properly selected depending on the distance at
which data communications can be effected with data
processing terminals, the communications system, and the
system for supplying electric power to portable terminals.As portable terminals having a function similar to
that of the portable terminals, there have been used wireless 
tags called ID tags or transponders,

external alternating magnetic field, and outputting an
inherent signal as a security signal.
The portable terminal according to Claim 1,
wherein said magnetic element is laminated with a film.
The portable terminal according to Claim 2,
wherein said magnetic element is entirely enclosed by the

film.
The portable terminal according to Claim 1 or 2,
wherein said portable terminal is a portable terminal.
The portable terminal according to Claim 4,
wherein magnetic properties of said magnetic element change

when said magnetic element is subjected to an application of

wherein a magnetic element containing a hard magnetic

material having a coercive force greater than that of the

externally applying an alternating magnetic field to
a wireless communication terminal having an integrated

therein as defined in Claim 4, to cause the magnetic element

to undergo an abrupt magnetization reversal and hence emit a
magnetic security pulse;
detecting the magnetic security pulse; and
processing the detected magnetic security pulse.

comprising the step of externally emitting a corresponding

security signal from the antenna provided in the portable
terminal, while simultaneously using the antenna to detect

the magnetic security pulse emitted by the magnetic element.

generates a respective inherent signal;
detecting the magnetic intensity of magnetization
reversal of each of the elements according to the respective

inherent signal generation time and the exciting waveform of

identifying a kind of each of the elements using the
magnetic intensity of magnetization reversal to thereby

identify the article;
wherein one of the elements has a known magnetic
intensity of magnetization reversal and is disposed on the

article as a reference element, so that each of the
intensities of magnetic field applied to the article can be

calculated according to the time during which this signal is
generated and the exciting waveform of the alternating

magnetic field of the reference element, and the magnetic
intensity of magnetization reversal of the other elements are

detected according to the results of the reference element.
