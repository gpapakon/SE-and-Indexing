<ABSTRACT>
A radiation-sensitive resist composition comprising 
a surface active agent having a perfluoroalkenyl 

group having 6 or more carbon atoms in the molecule. 
When said radiation-sensitive resist composition is 

filtered through a filter, the surface active agent is 
not adsorbed by the filter, so that striation is not 

caused and a coating film having a uniform thickness is 
always stably obtained from the above composition. Said 

radiation-sensitive resist composition is also excellent 
in developability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radiation 
sensitive resist composition useful for fine processing 
using various radiations. In the field of fine processing using a lithographic 
technique for producing a semiconductor, a semiconductor 
integrated circuit and the like, resists are 
required to be excellent in radiation-responding 
characteristics such as resolution, sensitivity and the 
like and also capable of forming a coating film free 
from unevenness and having a uniform thickness in order 
to form a highly precise and fine resist pattern in 
which the mask pattern has been reproduced with high 
fidelity. Representatives of the resists which have 
heretofore been used in fine processing include (i) a 
resist in which an alkali-soluble resin such as novolak 
resin or the like is compounded with a compound having a 
quinonediazide group as a sensitizing agent, (ii) a 
chemically amplified resist in which a radiation-sensitive 
acid generator which generates an acid upon 
irradiation with a radiation (the irradiation is 
referred to hereinafter as the exposure) is used and the 
sensitivity of the resist has been enhanced with the 
catalytic action of the acid generated, and the like.  However, the conventional resists have such 
common problems that uneven coating called "striation" 
is caused. The striation is unevenness caused in a 
coating film when a resist is applied onto a substrate 
by, for example, a spin-coating, and shows a radial 
striped pattern in the visual observation, which pattern 
has wave-like undulations whose difference of altitude 
is usually about several hundreds of angstrom. When such a striation is caused, such a 
problem is caused that the straight line shape and 
reproducibility of pattern are impaired and it becomes 
very difficult to form a resist pattern having the 
desired precision. Under such circumstances, research has been 
made for inhibiting or preventing such a striation from 
being caused, and as a result, it has recently been 
found that the striation can be considerably prevented 
from being caused by incorporating a surface active 
agent such as a fluorine-containing surfactant or the 
like into the resist (see, for example, Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai No. 59-155,836). Also, it has been 
known that a photosensitive lithographic plate having a 
uniform film thickness can be formed from a photosensitive 
composition comprising a fluorine-containing 
surfactant (see Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 
54-135,004). However, a resist is usually subjected to
