<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition containing a quinoline or quinazoline derivative
which has inhibitory activity of bone resorption and is useful
as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against osteoporosis.Osteoporosis is a morbid state or disease wherein
bone mass is so decreased as to cause some symptoms or danger.
Its main symptoms are kyphosis of spine and fracture of lumber
vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, femoral neck, distal ends of
radii, ribs, the proximal ends of humeri or the like. In
normal bone tissues, destruction by bone formation and bone
resorption are repeated with a balance. Osteoblasts and
osteoclasts play major roles in bone formation and bone
resorption, respectively. When the balance between bone
formation and bone resorption is lost and bone resorption
exceeds bone formation, bone mass is decreased. Therefore,
it is believed that drugs inhibiting bone resorption are
useful for preventing and treating osteoporosis, and bone
resorption inhibitors such as estrogen, calcitonin and the 
like have been administered as drugs for treating
osteoporosis.However, in the administration of these drugs, the
subject is limited and the resulting effects are sometimes
uncertain, and satisfactory effects have not been obtained.Thus, it is desired to develop an agent of preventing or
treating the increase of bone resorption.EP-A-0 567 107 describes quinoline and quinazoline
derivatives for treating arthritis.The main object of the present invention is to
provide a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting bone
resorption.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or
treating osteoporosis.These objects as well as other objects and
advantages of the present invention will become apparent to
those skilled in the art from the following description.The present inventors have intensively studied to
develop generally applicable pharmaceutical compositions which
have a direct effect on bones to inhibit bone resorption. As
a result, it has been found that quinoline or quinazoline
derivatives of the following formula (I) have a direct effect 
on bones to exhibit potent inhibitory activity of bone
resorption.Thus, the present invention is directed to the use of a
compound of the formula (I):

wherein
Y is a nitrogen atom or C-G in which G is an optionally
esterified or optionally amidated carboxyl group, or
hydroxymethyl group;R is an optionally substituted hydrocarbon group or
optionally substituted heterocyclic group;X is an
