<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a microprocessor, a register is provided as an additional special function register for expanding the address range of the program counter, which register actually comprises two individual registers connected in series. One register supplies the most-significant address bits via an AND gate and is also coupled to the internal data bus. The register contents are automatically altered when the program counter passes through the end position or start position. In the case of program jumps, the previous contents of the register are likewise stored in the stack, for which only a few instructions from the normal instruction set are additionally necessary. In the case of an interrupt, the AND gate is inhibited, as a result of which the first segment of the program memory with the interrupt service routines is automatically addressed. In this way, linear expansion of the program address range is provided without impairing compatibility.

<CLAIMS>
A microprocessor, comprising a processing unit (20) for receiving and
decoding instructions, an internal data bus (12), a program memory (30) for supplying

instructions, a program counter (8) for a predetermined number of address bits for
addressing the program memory (30), a first register (2) which comprises an input and

an output for supplying additional most-significant address bits for the program memory
(30) on an address output (7b), a second register (4) which comprises an input which i
s
coupled to the internal data bus (12) and an output which is coupled to the input of the

first register (2), a counting pulse circuit (10) which comprises inputs which are
connected to the outputs of the program counter (8), and counting pulse outputs (11a,

11b) which are connected to further inputs of the first register (2) is order to change the
contents of the first register when the program counter (8) passes through its maximum

or minimum position, and a stack for storing return jump data,
characterized in that
 the output of the first register (2) is coupled to the internal data bus
(12), 
via
 a switch (16) which is controlled by the processing unit (20), in order to
buffer the contents of the first register (2) in the event of a subroutine call, to store

these contents in the stack by way of the first instruction of the subroutine, and to write
these contents from the stack into the second register at the end of the subroutine, and

that the output of the first register (2) is connected to the address output (7b) 
via
 AND-gates
(6) and a common control input (6a) of the AND-gates (6) is connected to an

interrupt circuit (28, 32, 38) in order to block the AND-gates (6) at least at the
beginning of the processing of an interrupt signal.
A microprocessor as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
microprocessor comprises a number of directly addressed special-function registers, and

that the first and the second register (2, 4) together form an additional special-function
register.
A microprocessor as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
interrupt circuit (28, 32) comprises a first storage member (28) which is set in response

to the occurrence of an interrupt signal and is reset in upon execution of an address 
jump, its output being coupled to the control input (6a) of the AND-gates (6) 
via
 a
NAND-gate (32), a further input of which is coupled to the processing unit (20) in

order to receive a signal during the execution of an interrupt routine.
A microprocessor as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 the counting pulse circuit (10) is coupled to outputs for the two
most-significant address bits (A15, A14) of the program counter (8) and comprises a

second memory stage (40) for storing the signal state of the most-significant address bit
(A15) for a given period of time after a change of state of this address bit and two gates

(42, 44), each of which comprises at least three inputs, the inputs of each gate being
coupled to at least one output (41) of the memory stage (40) and to the outputs for the

two most-significant address bits (A15, A14) so that one gate (42) outputs a count-up
pulse for the first register (2) when both address bits change their state from high to

low, and the other gate (44) outputs a count-down pulse for the first register (2) when
both address bits change their state from low to high.
