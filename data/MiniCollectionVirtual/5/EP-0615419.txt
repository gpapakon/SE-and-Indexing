<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tufted carpet or mat product
according to the preamble of independent claim 1.For a long time it has been known for mats and
carpets to use a nap of inflammable natural fibres, such as
cotton fibres, and it is also known to use synthetic polymeric
inflammable fibres, such as cellulose fibres, acrylic
fibres, polyester fibers, nylon fibers and polypropylene
fibres for the manufacture of nap materials.Attempts have been made in order to make such nap
materials less inflammable or self-extinguishing, however,
with no appreciable success. Although the treatment with the
known fire inhibiting agents are reducing the inflammability,
the treated mats and carpets expose certain undesired
properties, such as the emission of unfavourable vapours by
intense heat. The most undesired effect is, however, that
said fire inhibiting agents are removed from the mats or
carpets in question, when said carpets or mats are exposed to
washing procedures, and this involves further finishing
treatment of the mats or carpets after the washing operation.
In this connection it should be mentioned that the receivers
of such washed mats or carpets do not have any visible
guarantee for the products having been impregnated with fire
inhibiting agents. Unfortunately, this does not appear until
the product in question has been exposed to a fire test or a
fire accident. Consequently, on places where a fire could
have disastrous consequences, it should be avoided to use
mats and carpets, the fire inhibiting properties of which are
only based on fire inhibiting impregnation agents, since 
promises on the presence of such agents may cause a false
feeling of security. Document US-A-4 513 042 discloses a fabric adapted
to be used as coverings for floors and having high flame
resistance.Consequently, it is the purpose of the present
invention to provide a new tufted carpet or mat product which
is not provided with flame and fire inhibiting chemicals in
the nap, but which per se is self-extinguishing and can pass
the socalled California firetest, and which also fulfill the
conditions for being called a washable dirt and liquid
binding service product of the carpet or mat type for floor
covering.Said purpose is achieved with a
mat product according to the independent claim 1.
Thereby it has surprisingly turned out that for mat and
carpet products a hitherto unknown self-extinguishing or fire
inhibiting effect may be obtained when using a hitherto
unknown combination of otherwise well known and often used
materia
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mat product comprising a primary
support fabric having an underside and an upper side, a layer

of rubber or synthetic rubber adhered thereto, e.g. by vulcanizing
to the underside of the primary support fabric, and

yarn nops extending through the primary support fabric for
forming of a nap on the upper side of the primary support

fabric and for forming of nap nop bottom parts between the
rubber layer and the primary support fabric, wherein

the material of the primary support fabric
consists of fibers which per se has a high ignition point, such

as fibers of acryl, fluorocarbons,
potyacetales, polyamides, polyesters, polyethylenes, polypropylenes,

polyurethane 
and the rubber layer is selected from the group of washable

rubbers being flame retardant, 

characterized in

that the nap comprises 70-95, preferably 80 weight per cent
animal wool and 5-30, preferably 20 weight per cent synthetic

fibres, such as fibers of acryl, fluorocarbons, polyacetales,
polyamides, polyesters, polyethylenes, polypropylenes,

polyurethanes
Tufted product according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the primary support fabric material comprises a layer of
woven or non woven fiber having an area weight from 90-130,

preferably 110 g/square meter.
Tufted product according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
the part of the nap, viz. the nap nop bottom parts, which

e.g. by a needle technique has been needled through the
primary support fabric, is partly vulcanized into the layer

of natural or synthetic rubber.
Tufted product according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
the rubber layer is resistant against 

acids, bases, gasoline and mineral oils, at least to the same
extent as nitrile butadiene rubber.
Tufted product according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
the rubber layer is selected from the group of rubbers

consisting of nitrile butadiene rubbers, butadiene acryl
nitriles, polychlorophrenes, chlorosulphonatedpolyethylenes,

ethylene/acryl elastomers, perfluoro elastomers, fluoroelastomers,
polyesterelatomers, urethane rubbers and polysiloxan

polymers.
