<ABSTRACT>
For a vacuum cleaning unit (10), a cleaning tool employing a 
rotatably driven brush (35) and having a split manifold (29) 

therein which 
allows a vacuum airflow to be directed to the outermost 

longitudinal ends of the brush (35) without interference with a drive 
belt (38) rotatably driving the brush at its approximate longitudinal 

midpoint. The cleaning tool includes an upper housing (26) having a 
centrally disposed cut-out portion (40) and a semi-circular portion 

for partially housing the brush therein. A cut-out is formed in 
a base portion of the upper housing (26). A lower housing (28) also has 

a cut-out shaped identically to that of the cut-out portion of 
the upper housing. A front sole plate (30) is included which is 

secured to the lower housing and which includes a pair of 
openings (56) separated by a central portion (58), 

where the openings allow 
portions of the brush to protrude. Each of the upper and lower 

housings further have runner portions which form airflow channels 
through which a vacuum airflow may be generated. When the upper 

and lower housings are secured together, a drive belt is able to 
extend through the centrally disposed cut-out portion, the 

cut-out portion in the base of the upper housing and the cut-out 
portion in the lower housing to engage at its approximate 

longitudinal mid-point. The apparatus thus allows a brush to be 
rotatably driven from its approximate longitudinal mid-point 

while providing an increased vacuum airflow to the outermost end 
portions of the brush. In an alternative embodiment, a 

snappingly engageable front sole plate is provided which allows 
quick and easy access to the interior of the cleaning tool with 

the need to remove threaded fasteners or the like, or the need 
for any external tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cleaning tools and, more 
particularly, to a cleaning tool having a rotationally driven 
brush which is adapted to be used in connection with a vacuum 
generating device such as a vacuum cleaner. Vacuum cleaners are used in a variety of applications to 
clean various work surfaces such as floors, walls, as well as 
furniture and tables. Vacuum cleaner units often are used with 
cleaning accessories in the form of attachments which may be 
quickly and easily removed from a vacuum cleaner hose or wand. 
Such attachments typically aid one in even more thoroughly 
cleaning a surface than would otherwise be possible with just the 
vacuum force provided by a vacuum unit. One type of cleaning tool attachment which is used 
extensively with vacuum cleaner units is that employing a brush 
unit. The brush may be driven by a motor to help loosen dirt and 
other debris from carpeted surfaces or other cloth covered 
surfaces such as that which might be encountered on furniture. With the above described cleaning tool attachment it is 
important that some means be provided by which the brush can be 
driven rotationally by the motor and that a vacuum airflow may 
be generated through the areas of the cleaning tool closely 
adjacent the brush to pick up dirt and debris loosened by the 
brush from a surface. It is important that the cleaning tool 
attachment not only is designed to maximize the vacuum force 
which may be developed in the areas closely adjacent the brush,  
 
but also that the brush be driven positively and with a minimum 
amount of interruption to the vacuum airflow surrounding the 
brush. It would be even further desirable if the brush could be 
driven at its approximate longitudinal mid-point rather than at 
one of its ends as is more typically employed. While the latter 
form of driving arrangement has worked well, even better edge 
cleaning capability could be afforded by locating the driving 
element on the brush at its approximate longitudinal midpoint, 
which enables the tufts of the brush, and especially its 
outermost ends, to extend completely to both outermost ends of 
the brush. Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present 
invention to provide a cleaning tool which may be quickly and 
easily attached and removed from a vacuum cleaner hose or wand 
attachment, and which includes a brush which is even more 
positively driven than heretofore developed cleaning tools having 
rotatably driven brushes. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide 
a
