<ABSTRACT>
At least one of the mating wear surfaces (22,24) of a sliding 
mechanical seal (10) is coated with diamond. The coating includes an 

underlayer of high resistance to wear and an overlayer with a 
reduced resistance to wear as compared to that of the underlayer. 

The reduced wear resistance of the overlayer prevents damage by the 
diamond to the opposing mating surface during the wear-in period of 

use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to wear parts and relates
particularly, but not exclusively, to wear parts of mechanical seals.It is known to coat the wear surfaces of wear parts, such a seals,
dies, engine parts, and other apparatus with a layer of material harder
than the underlying material of the part in order to reduce the wear rate of
the part. Diamond film deposited by CVD (chemical vapor deposition), as
is described, for example, in « Diamond Coatings » by W.J.P. van
Enckevort, Journal of Hard Materials, vol. 1, No. 4, 1990, pp 247-269, is
particularly useful for this purpose, since diamond has not only great
hardness but also a relatively low coefficient of friction.CVD-diamond coated tools are known from EP 0 449 571, with
high abrasion resistance; EP'571 mentions to vary the density of carbon
in the CVD gas, with the result that the rake region is said to be of a
better crystalline quality (with high abrasion resistance) while the
« fixation » region is of a worse quality.JP 125 15 70 discloses mating surfaces being CVD diamond-coated.
That document
additionally teaches to use two diamond-coated surfaces.Among the most severe applications for wear surfaces are various
seals for rotating shafts to seal their passage through a wall. Typically
such seals have mating flange members mounted on the shaft and on
the wall, respectively. When in service, the flanges rotate against each
other under mutual pressure and form a seal between their mating faces
under these conditions. Polycrystalline diamond would appear to be an
almost ideal material for use on the wear surfaces of rotary seals, since
in addition to its above-mentioned favorable wear qualities, it also is
quite resistant to most chemical corrosion. However, one problem with 
diamond in such an application is that if the surface of the diamond
coating is not highly even and polished, even very small rough spots on
the face can rapidly cause severe damage to the mating face, even if it
too is coated with diamond. In most cases it is desirable that the second
mating member not be coated with diamond, since such a coating is
relatively expensive. Therefore, ceramic materials, such as silicon
carbide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, or another ceramic or composite
materials are often used. These materials are much softer than diamond
and are immediately degraded by any roughness or unevenness of the
diamond-coated opposing surface.While the above problems can be dealt with by careful finishing of
the diamond coating, such finishing is very
