<ABSTRACT>
The hydraulically operated front-wheel and rear-wheel brake systems (12 and 13) proposed for two-wheeled vehicles are linked mechanically to each other by a coupling (5) but separated from each other hydraulically. Each is connected to an actuation device (14 and 15) respectively. By virtue of the mechanical coupling (5), the two brake systems (12 and 13) can be operated together by one of the actuation devices (15), but remain separate in the event of a failure, each being operable by means of its associated actuation device (14 or 15).

A fluid interlinked brake device for two-wheeled 
vehicles including two brake systems (12,13) associated 

with respective wheels - the front wheel and the rear 
wheel - and each comprising at least one brake unit 

(17,17a,20); and two independent actuators (14,15) for a 
respective one of the brake systems (12,13), a first (12) 

of which is connected to the associated actuator (14) by 
means of a coupler (5), which includes two pressure 

medium chambers (35a,35b), characterised in that the 
first brake system (12) is fluidically connected to the 

first pressure medium space (35a), which is connected to 
the associated actuator (14), of the coupler (5) and is 

actuable by the pressure medium displaced from the first 
pressure medium chamber and that the coupler (5) includes 

a control element, which may be urged against the 
connecting member (8) and which acts with a biasing force 

against an actuating force resulting from action on the 
connecting member (8) via the second pressure medium 

chamber (35b), which biasing force corresponds to a 
predetermined braking force of the second brake system 

(13), whereby the connecting member (8) is only movable 
towards the first pressure medium chamber (35a) when the 

actuating force exceeds this biasing force and the first 
brake system (12) is actuable by means of the actuator 

(15) of the second brake system (13). 
Brake device as claimed in claim 1, the coupler (5) 
of which includes an isolating piston (8) as the 

connecting member, characterised in that a valve is 
provided as the coupler (5) which has two inlets (31,32), 

associated with a respective one of the actuators 
(14,15), two outlets (33,34), associated with a  

 
respective one of the brake systems (12,13), and a bore 

(35), which constitutes the pressure medium chambers 
(35a,35b) and connects these inlets and outlets and which 

includes the control element (9) and the isolating piston 
(8), which is sealingly guided in the bore and which 

isolates the pressure medium chambers (35a,35b) from one 
another and which is adjustable between a normal 

position, which is associated with the outlet (34) to the 
second, e.g. rear, brake system (13) and which permits 

selective actuation of each of the brake systems (12 and 
13) by the associated actuator (14 and 15, respectively), 

and an operative position offset towards the outlet (33) 
to the first, e.g. front, brake system (12), whereby when 

the second brake system (13) is actuated by the 
associated actuator (15) the first brake system (12) is 

also actuable by means of a corresponding operative 
movement of the isolating piston (8) with an actuating 

force which exceeds the biasing force of the control 
element (9). 
Brake device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the biasing force of the control 

element (9) corresponds to a braking force of the second, 
particularly rear, brake system (13) which exceeds a 

predetermined value of this braking force necessary for 
maximum deceleration of the two-wheeled vehicle. 
Brake device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the first, particularly 

front, brake system (12) is so constructed that a braking 
force may be produced by the pressure medium displaced by 

the connecting member (8) which is smaller than a value 
of this braking force necessary for maximum deceleration 

of the two-wheeled vehicle.  
 
Brake device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coupler (5) includes a 

valve body (38), which is associated with the pressure 
medium chamber (35a) of the first, particularly front, 

brake system (12) and which may be urged with a 
predetermined closing force against a valve seat 

connected to the associated actuator (14) and may be 
moved between a closed position shutting off the 

connection between this actuator (14) and the pressure 
medium chamber (35a) and an open position opening the 

same. 
Brake device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the valve body (38) is movable by way of a piston 

part (37), which is guided in a bore (36) in the coupler 
(5), which may be connected to the second pressure medium 

chamber (35b), connected to the second brake system (13), 
and may be acted upon by pressure medium by way of the 

latter. 
Brake device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the 

actuators (15) includes a unit (11) for amplifying the 
actuating force. 
Brake device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the brake 

systems (12 and 13) includes an ABS anti-locking pressure 
controller (6,7) arranged in the connection between the 

coupler (5) and at least one brake unit (17,17a and 20, 
respectively) of the brake system (12,13 respectively) 

concerned.  
 
A two-wheeled vehicle having a brake device as 
claimed in one of claims 1 to 8.
