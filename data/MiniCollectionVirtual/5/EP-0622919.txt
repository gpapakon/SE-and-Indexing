<ABSTRACT>
Of the type that performs a conversion between input data streams 
and standard interfaces with the same information rate. 
The device comprises a first line receiver (RX1) for a first input 
data stream that detects errors in the received stream and an interface 

converter (IC1) that suppresses the bits in it not carrying information 
and performs the interface conversion. It also comprises a second 

interface converter (IC2) and a line transmitter (TX1) for conversion 
in the opposite direction. 
It also includes a second line receiver (RX2) for a second input 
data stream that detects the errors in the received stream, a memory 

module (MM1) where various frames of the incoming interface are stored 
in the addresses indicated by a memory control module (MCM), such that 

reading this sequentially generates the equivalent standard type 
interfaces. There is another memory module (MM2) and another line 

transmitter (TX2) that perform the conversion in the opposite 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The interface conversion device, as indicated in the title, refers 
to a device that carries out the conversion of data streams interfaces 
to standard digital interfaces, and vice versa, in which the net 
information is the same for both interfaces. There are various standard interfaces for the transmission of data 
in digital form that must ensure that communications between the 
different parts that constitute a system occur in a reliable manner 
thanks to the correct interpretation of the data contained in these 
interfaces. Below, in the description, different standard interfaces 
are explained for 2 Mb/s and 512 kb/s. There are also a great variety of internal interfaces that are 
normally employed by companies engaged in the design of communications 
equipments in order to make best use of the features available within a 
closed communications equipment or system, based, fundamentally, on 
criteria such as signals employed, signal availability, error 
protection, etc. In this respect, Alcatel has specified internal 
interfaces termed SBI*I1 and SBI*I2 for 4 Mb/s, the net information 
rate of which corresponds to that of the aforementioned standard 
interfaces of one 2 Mb/s channel and eight standard 512 kb/s 
interfaces, respectively. Up until now, the equipments making use of these internal 
interfaces had no need to interchange information streams with other 
system that used standard interfaces, consequently the problem of 
performing this kind of conversion did not arise. However, nowadays, 
the flexibility of the current range of communications equipments 
permits high-level interconnectability; for this reason, both 
interfaces must be adapted so that the information interchanged is 
correctly interpreted by the equipments or systems that make use of it 
through the corresponding interfaces. A new requirement has therefore 
arisen for which no technical solution exists. Consequently the technical problem to be overcome consists in  
 
forming a communications link between systems, in both directions, that 
employ different line interfaces of the Alcatel internal interface types 
and standard 2 Mb/s and 512 kb/s interfaces. The conversion device according to the invention is characterised 
in that it comprises a first line receiver that receives a first and a 
second serial data streams, identical to each other, producing at its 
output only one of the two input streams, the choice of which depending 
on a first control signal. It also comprises a first interface converter that receives the

INTERFACE CONVERSION DEVICE characterised in that it 
comprises: 


a first line receiver (RX1) that receives a first and a second 
serial data streams (F1,F2), identical to each other, and which 

produces at its output a single serial data stream corresponding to one 
of the two input data streams that is selected by a first control 

signal (CS1); 
a first interface converter (IC1) that receives the serial data 
stream coming from the first line receiver (RX1) and which produces at 

its output a third serial data stream (F3) that contains only the 
information bits of the input data stream, transmitted at one half of 

the input bit rate, the remaining bits without information and the 
parity bit of each channel being suppressed; 
a second interface converter (IC2) that receives a fourth serial 
data stream (F4), and which generates at its output a fifth serial data 

stream (F5) to which it adds, after each channel, a byte without 
information, in this way duplicating the bit rate of this fourth serial 

data stream (F4), and 
a first line transmitter (TX1) that receives the fifth serial data 
stream (F5) coming from the second interface converter (IC2) and which 

generates the parity bit for each channel placing it in the last 
channel position and also duplicates this data stream bit rate, 

transmitting from its output a sixth and a seventh serial data streams 
(F6,F7), identical to each other.

a second line receiver (RX2) that receives an eighth and a ninth 
serial data streams (F8,F9), identical to each other, that produces at 

its output a single data stream corresponding to one of the two input 
streams that is selected by a second control signal (CS2); 
a first memory module (MM1) that temporarily stores four 
consecutive data frames coming from the second line receiver (RX2) in 

order to demap them during the reading of this module and to have at 
its output a first bus (B1) containing the eight streams that 

 
constitute each burst held in a standard interface, all this being in 

accordance with the commands issued by a memory control module (MCM); 
a second memory module (MM2) that receives a second bus (B2) 
that holds various standard interface streams in which are stored, in 

the addresses indicated by the memory control module (MCM), the data 
equivalent to four consecutive frames such that, during the reading of 

this memory module a mapping takes place, and 
a second line transmitter (TX2) that receives the tenth serial 
data stream (F10) coming from the second memory module (MM2) that 

inserts four cyclic redundancy check bits in channels 15 and 31 and 
that also duplicates this data stream bit rate in order to transmit
