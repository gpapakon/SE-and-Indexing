<ABSTRACT>
It is applicable to the recovery mainly of pastry goods, 
such as cookies, biscuits or the like, packaged in cardboard, 

plastic or the like, which may also include staples, nails 
or other fastening and sealing elements. 
The raw material in bulk is received in a hopper (1) 
from which it is led by means of an Archimedean screw (2) 

to a hammer mill or the like (4) in order to be ground. 
After passing through some grids it is collected by a 

second helicoidal screw (6), whose covering frame (7) has 
in its final section a grating (12) that defines a screen 

where the useable material in the form of grain or flour 
is separated by gravity. 
The unuseable material and that still contains particles 
of edible material passes to a trommel (8), at the 

outlet of which there is an absorption device (9) of the 

unuseable material. 
In the top part of the hammer mill (4) there is a 
device with magnets (5) to remove the possible staples, 

nails, etc. The compact or metallic remains that come 
out of the trommel (8) and which are not collected by the 

absorption device (9) are returned to the grinding mill 
(4.)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an installation for the
use for animal consumption of outdated or spoiled foodstuffs intended for human consumption
, having a series of relevant and
advantageous features over those presently used for the
same purpose.Presently there is a large variety of foodstuffs for
human consumption that have to be thrown away as their expiration
date has gone by, or because they have become
spoiled and thus they are not a marketable product. A
product that has been discarded in the manufacturing
process because it has not passed the quality controls may
also be considered.The invention is applicable to all types of solid
foodstuffs (such as for example, sugar, cereals, legumes,
flours and derivatives thereof, dairy products, chocolates,
baby food, dietetic foods, sweets, dried fruits, etc.)
that are packaged in paper, cardboard, PVC, plastic, etc.
For example,
in a box of madeleines we can see that each one of them is packaged individually
in a type of paper cup, and that a plurality of madeleines
thus packaged are contained in a plastic tray; a
series of trays is contained in a cardboard box which in
turn is sealed and labeled.A box of madeleines whose expiration date has gone
by is no longer apt for human consumption. However, it is
apt for animal consumption, but for such a purpose it is
necessary to separate the edible material from that which
is not edible, in this case, all the containers and wrappings
that go with the edible product. Since the product
is practically a waste, it is not profitable to separate the
edible product by hand. For the purpose of doing so 
the present invention provides an installation for
a mechanical process which is rapid and industrializable.DE-A-3823271 describes
a process and an installation to recover outdated pastry
goods in pastry in granular form.
Different materials of the wrappers are differentiated so
clearly according to the shape and content, that most of
these materials can be separated by suction. If magnetic
iron alloys are contained, these alloys are separated by
known magnetic separation means, in such a way that once
the different parts of the wrapper are separated by suction
the material to be recovered is converted into a flat layer
that is controlled in the selection machine. This raw
material is crumbled and then subjected to drying and cooling
Depending on the need of having a bacteria-free grain, in
other words, top quality grain, and on the possibility of
manufacturing lower quality grain, a soaking area is installed
between

Installation for recycling, for animal consumption,
outdated or spoiled food products intended for human

consumption, said installation including:

a hopper (1) for receiving the product to be
recycled;
a first helicoidal screw (2) inside a covering
frame for transporting the product from said hopper (1) to

a grinding device (4) of the product, said grinding device
being provided with grids placed at its base, arranged such

that the ground product passes through said grids;
characterized in that the installation further comprises:
a second helicoidal screw (6) for collecting the
product coming from said grinding device (4) and for

transporting it towards a separating device (8);
a covering tube (7) of said second helicoidal
screw (6), said covering tube having in its end section a

screen (12) comprising a plurality of perforations for
separating useable foodstuff, said screen (12) being

arranged such that useable foodstuff will fall by gravity
from said perforations, the installation being arranged for

passing the remaining product to said separating device
(8), said separating device including means for carrying

out a final sieving or sifting and means for throwing out
inedible material after said final sieving or sifting.
Installation according to claim 1, wherein the grinding
device (4) includes a magnetic device (5), for separating

ferric or metallic material present in the raw material.
Installation according to claim 1, wherein the grinding
device (4) comprises in its top part a removal duct with a

bag (11) for recovering the product in powder form and
other unusable pieces thrown out by the grinding device

(4). 
Installation according to claim 1, wherein said
grinding device (4) is a hammer mill.
Installation according to claim 1, wherein said
separating device (8) comprises a variable speed trommel.
Installation according to claim 1, wherein the means
for throwing out inedible material include a variable power

absorption device (9).
Installation according to claim 1, further including
means for introducing the inedible material that is thrown

out into a packaging vessel which is provided for receiving
said material.
Installation according to claim 5, further including
means for returning foreign bodies or compact material that

does not pass through the grid of the trommel (8) and that
is not absorbed by the ventilator-collector (13) to the

grinding device (4), by means of a third helicoidal screw
(14).
Installation according to claim 1, wherein the discharge
ends of the helicoidal screws (2,6) have a radial blade

that pushes the raw material avoiding jamming.
Installation according to the preceding claims,
wherein the helicoidal screws (2,6,14), as well as the drum

of the trommel (8) and the ventilator-collector (13) of the
absorption device (9) turn by means of variable speed

motors.
Installation according to any of he preceding claims,
wherein the end section of the covering tube (7) includes 

an interchangeable screen (12), allowing the size of the
perforations to be adapted to the product being processed.
