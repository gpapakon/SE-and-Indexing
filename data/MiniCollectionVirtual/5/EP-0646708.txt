<ABSTRACT>
A control assembly and method for operating the 
throttle of an internal combustion engine, in 

particular but not exclusively, a diesel engine of 
a heavy duty vehicle, is provided whereby fuel 

can be saved by controlling the throttle 
operation. Sensing means (42) detect certain 

undesirable throttle conditions or movements such 
as full throttle for an excessive period of time; 

the number of times a throttle is pumped; and the 
speed with which the throttle mechanism is moved, 

and the assembly acts to reduce the fuel supply to 
the engine to an extent whereat the engine does 

not lose engine speed to any appreciable extent at 
constant load.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a throttle control method and 
device for operating internal combustion engines and, 
more particularly, but not exclusively, internal 
combustion engines installed in motor vehicles and, 
still more particularly, heavy duty motor vehicles. Still more particularly the invention relates to 
throttle control which is aimed at diminishing the 
adverse effects of manipulating the throttle control 
mechanism or accelerator in an undesirable or highly 
uneconomic manner. The adverse effect of particular 
interest is poor fuel consumption, as well as the 
increased wear and tear associated with poor or abusive 
throttle control. The invention is most particularly concerned with 
diesel powered engines but the same principles 
generally apply to other engines and the scope hereof 
is intended to include such other engines. In this specification the term "manual" or "manually" 
will be used to mean by human effort irrespective of 
whether a hand or foot is used. Thus the term 
"manually operable" includes foot operable. Diesel engines are widely used in many different 
applications. Probably the most common of these is in 
motor transport vehicles but numerous other 
applications include agricultural tractors; earth 
working machines such as bulldozers, front end loaders, 
mechanical shovels and the like; fork lift trucks, 
cranes and locomotives as well as mechanical coal 
picks; and, stationary applications such as air 
compressors and the like.  
 In most of these applications the engine is required to 
accommodate varying loads and to provide maximum power 
at times, and regularly, for significant periods of 
time, after which reduced power, or in fact no power, 
may be demanded for other periods of time. Irrespective of the sophistication of the throttle 
control means for such diesel engines, at least in the 
vast majority of instances, when such an engine is 
operated at maximum or near maximum throttle to achieve 
maximum or near maximum power from the engine, a 
correspondingly large amount of fuel is injected into 
the cylinders of such an engine. This invariably 
manifests itself in a significant amount of fuel being 
wasted in the form of partly burnt fuel emitted as 
black smoke. The emission of such black smoke very 
often continues for so long as the throttle control 
mechanism is at or near full throttle settings. It is generally accepted that the provision of a 
substantially rich fuel mixture in the cylinders is 
desirable for providing maximum power as and when 
requir

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating an internal combustion 
engine of the type having a manually operable 

throttle operating mechanism (6, 67) operatively 
connected to fuel supply control means (2, 60) for 

the internal combustion engine; the method 
comprising, each time full or near full throttle 

is demanded by the operation of the throttle 
operating mechanism, allowing the fuel supply 

control means to adopt a corresponding full or 
near full throttle condition for a period of time, 

following which the fuel supply control means is 
moved to reduce the fuel flow to the internal 

combustion engine; the method being characterised 
in that the extent to which the fuel supply 

control means is moved to reduce fuel flow to the 
engine is chosen such that, at constant load, in 

spite of the reduction in fuel flow to the engine, 
the speed of rotation of the engine remains 

substantially unaffected at the prevailing load. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that the fuel supply control means is moved 

automatically to reduce such flow to the internal 
combustion engine irrespective of the fact that 

the manually operable throttle operating mechanism 
remains in a position corresponding to full or 

near full throttle. 
A method as claimed in claim 2 characterised in 
that subsequent full throttle operation of the 

fuel supply control means is allowed again only 
subsequent to the manually operable throttle  

 
operating mechanism having been moved to a 

predetermined extent towards a position 
corresponding to a closed condition of the 

throttle. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the movement of the 

fuel supply control means to reduce the fuel flow 
to the internal combustion engine is achieved by 

means of a linkage (7, 66) in the throttle 
operating mechanism which provides selectively for 

lost motion between the manually operable throttle 
operating mechanism and the fuel supply control 

means. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 characterised in 
that the degree of lost motion is adjustable to 

adjust the extent of reduction of fuel flow to 
comply with the parameter of substantially not 

affecting the engine speed at a constant load when 
the reduction in fuel supply takes place. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that said period of time 

is adjustable or selectable according to engine 
operation conditions, or both. 
A control assembly for operating an internal 
combustion engine and for controlling the 

operation of fuel supply control means (1) 
associated with an internal combustion engine and 

wherein the fuel supply control means is activated 
by a manually operable throttle operating 

mechanism (6), the control assembly including 
reduction means (7) for reducing fuel flow to the 

engine by way of the fuel supply control means  
 

when the manually operable throttle operating 
mechanism is in a full or near full throttle 

condition, said control assembly being 
characterised in that it includes delay means (40) 

allowing full throttle condition of the fuel 
supply control means for a predetermined period of 

time 
following which said control assembly is operable 

to reduce the fuel supply to the engine with the 
manually operable operating means remaining in a 

condition corresponding to full or near full 
throttle; 

said control assembly being in use adjustable 
such that the extent to which fuel flow to the 

engine is reduced can be set to provide a fuel 
flow reduction having substantially no affect on 

the engine speed under a prevailing constant load. 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 7 
characterised in that the reduction means is a 

throttle limiting unit (7) having a first 
condition in which full operation of the throttle 

is allowed and a second condition in which 
somewhat restricted operation of the throttle is 

available so as to prevent full throttle opening 
and a controller forming part of the control 

assembly is adapted to select which of the two 
conditions prevail at any particular time. 
A control assembly is claimed in claim 8 
characterised in that the delay means is embodied 

in the controller and sensing means (42) for 
detecting the throttle opening or position of the 

throttle operating mechanism are provided and 
connected to the controller t
o give a signal to 
the controller.  

 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 9 
characterised in that the controller embodies a 

micro-processor (49) which is adapted to enable 
the controller operation to be set to initiate 

said second condition of the control assembly 
according to signals received from the sensing 

means. 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 10 
characterised in that the engine is a motor 

vehicle engine and two different sets of 
parameters associated with "undesirable" driving 

operations are selectable, in the alternative, one 
such set corresponding to "city" driving 

conditions and one corresponding to "country" 
driving conditions. 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 11 
characterised in that the micro-processor is 

programmed to select "city" or "country" driving 
conditions according to signals received from the 

sensing means which are characteristic of "city" 
or "country" driving, as the case may be. 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 12 
characterised in that the characteristic of "city" 

or "country" driving determined by the controller 
to be the fact that in "country" driving mode the 

throttle is significantly open for prolonged 
periods of time. 
A control assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
8 to 13 characterised in that the controller is 

adapted to sense the rate of change of position of 
the throttle mechanism and to cause the throttle  

 
limiting unit to adopt said second condition if 

such rate of change of positions is excessive. 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 14 together 
with claim 14 characterised in that the said rate 

of change of position is rendered inactive in the 
"country" driving mode. 
A control assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
8 to 15 characterised in that the controller is 

adapted to bring about said second condition of 
the control assembly in the event of the number of 

throttle mechanism operations sensed in a 
predetermined time period exceeds a preset maximum 

number. 
A control assembly as claimed in claim 16 
characterised in that the preset maximum number is 

based on the number of gears of a vehicle in which 
the control assembly is fitted. 
A control assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
11 to 15 or 17 characterised in that the said 

predetermined time period from which the full 
throttle condition is provided is substantially 

longer in the country driving mode than in the 
city driving mode. 
A control assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
9 to 13 characterised in that the sensing means 

(42) comprises two parts (45, 47) each adapted for 
connection, directly or indirectly, one to a 

movable part (2) of a throttle operating mechanism 
and one to a part stationary relative thereto, and 

wherein the one part (45) comprises a coil and the 
other part (47) comprises a magnetic substance,  

 
the relationship being such that movement of the 

magnetic substance relative to the coil causes 
changes in the inductance of the coil with a 

consequent change in frequency of a signal applied 
thereto. 
A control assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
8 to 13 or 19 characterised in that the throttle 

limiting unit (7) is a linear link providing for 
lost motion in said second condition, the link 

being installed as a linkage in the throttle 
operating mechanism.
