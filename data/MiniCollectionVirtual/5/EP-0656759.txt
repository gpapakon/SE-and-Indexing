<ABSTRACT>
The instrument is to be adapted to an ophthalmic slit-lamp (2, 6) and includes holders for fluorescence excitation and barrier filters (3, 5) in the light path and a detector system made of a linear array of photodiodes (8) with respective circuitry for reading and control. The light is focused in a chosen zone of the eye (13) inducing fluorescence by using specific wavelength. The fluorescence is measured by the detector (8) coupled to one of the eyepieces (12) of the slit-lamp (26), or to a beam-splitter (7) placed before the eyepieces (12). There is a system for digitalization of the signal from the detector (8) which is connected to an IBM compatible computer (11) where the data is stored and analysed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a new ocular fluorometer.The instrument is adapted to an ophthalmic slit-lamp (1) and includes
holders for fluorescence excitation and barrier filters (3,5) in the light path and a
detector system made of a linear array of photodiodes (8) with respective circuitry for
reading and control (9). The light is focused in a chosen zone of the eye (13) inducing
fluorescence by using specific wavelengths. The fluorescence is measured by the
detector (8) coupled to one of the eyepieces of the slit-lamp (1) or to a beam-splitter
(7) placed before the eyepieces.There is a system for digitisation of the signal from the detector which is
connected to an IBM-compatible computer (11) where the data is stored and analysed.The instrument has a spatial resolution of 50 mm (corresponding to the
spacing between the photodiodes) and a sensitivity (lower level of detection)
equivalent to the fluorescence of a fluorescein solution of 1 ng/ml. The excellent
reproducibility and linearity of the instrument and its design are particularly
appropriate for performing the most sophisticated ocular fluorometry measurements in
the clinical ophthalmologic practice, including studies of the permeability of the
blood-retinal barrier.The present invention relates to a new ocular fluorometer. The instrument is
based on an ophthalmic slit-lamp using specific pairs of fluorescence excitation and
barrier filters in the light path and a detector system made by a photodiode linear
array with respective circuitry for reading and control. The incoming light from the 
slit is focused in the eye location, where measurement of the induced fluorescence is
desired. This in turn is measured using a detector system placed in one of the
eyepieces of the slit-lamp microscope or using a beam-splitter, the other eyepiece
being used for focusing. There is also a system for digitisation of the signal from the
detector which is connected to a IBM compatible computer where the data is stored
and analysed.Since 1975, when the technique of vitreous fluorophotometry was proposed for
the first time, as a method designed to measure low concentrations of fluorescein in
the eye, and more specifically in the vitreous body, various different ocular
fluorometers have been proposed.The ocular fluorometers presently available have serious limitations. Among
them:
instrument used optically for posterior segment examination;fixed angle of measurement;automatic scanning of the whole axis of the eye;fixed filter system used only for fluorescein detection.This

<CLAIMS>
An Ocular Fluorometer for measuring exogenous and endogenous
fluorescence in specifically selected regions of clinical interest in the eye (13),

such as the cornea/aqueous, aqueous/lens and vitreous/retina interfaces, being
adapted to an ophthalmic slit-lamp (1) but allowing its simultaneous normal use,

including filters for excitation and barrier functions (3,5) and further comprising
an electronic component including a multiple photodiode detector (8), reading

and control logic (9), and a computer (11) for general supervision, storage and
graphic analysis of photometric results, characterised in that it includes a

mechanical device which allows for automated positioning in three main
positions of focusing, centred respectively on the anterior surface of the cornea,

anterior surface of the lens and retina-vitreous interface, whereby this automated
positioning is initiated with manual focusing, by an examiner, of the slit-lamp

on
the anterior surface of the lens, the examiner, after this initial step, having only

to press a cornea positioning button (I) or a retina positioning button (III) of the mechanical
device to bring automatically into focus, respectively, the area of the cornea or

the vitreous-retina interface, whereby, when measurements are performed in the
latter area, the angle of the instrument - between incident light and collected

light - is changed to 14°, the pupil must be dilated and an accessory lens must be
introduced into the path of light.
The Ocular Fluorometer according to claim 1 wherein the anterior
surfaces of the cornea, lens and retina are identified by specular reflection.
The Ocular Fluorometer according to claim 1 further comprising a
linear array of photodiodes (8), respective driver and readout circuits (9) for

providing clock and control signals with timing parameters adjusted to the 
experiment requirements and for signal conditioning, amplification and

quantification and controlled by a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) that maximises the
Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) data rate in

order to drastically reduce noise, whereby the photodiodes detect the fluorescent
light from an area in focus, allowing high resolution fluorescence measurements.
The Ocular Fluorometer according to claim 3, wherein said
photodiode array (8), further comprising an ultimate limit in spatial resolution of

50µm corresponding to the pixel-to-pixel spacing and a Lower Level of
Detection of 1 ng/ml fluorescein equivalent concentration.
The Ocular Fluorometer according to claim 3, further comprising a PC
module based on a Digital Signal Processor and having local

memory, plugged into an IBM compatible computer (11) slot, that drives the
detector 
module (9) of said Ocular Fluorometer through a 50-way flat cable (10),
reads converted data, performs some data pre-processing using software noise

reduction algorithms and assures an efficient connection to the host computer
(11) for measurements supervision, data storage and analysis, and graphical

interface with the user.
The Ocular Fluorometer according to claim 5, further comprising two
programs running simultaneously, one at the host computing means level and the

other at the local processing means.
The Ocular Fluorometer according to claim 3, wherein said
photodiode array is rotatable so as to act as both a spot and scanning

fluorometer, a feature that is particularly important in the anterior chamber.
