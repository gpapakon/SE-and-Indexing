<ABSTRACT>
A shortcircuiting system, particularly useful for by-passing an electrolyzer 
in a multiplicity of monopolar or bipolar electrolyzers in an electrolysis 

circuit, said system comprising power supply means for feeding 
electrolysis current to said electrolyzers, a jumper switch means for by-passing 

said electrolyzer and means for controlling and interrupting the 
electric current supplied to said electrolyzers at least for a time sufficient 

to permit shortcircuiting of the electrolyzer to be by-passed without 
significantly affecting the operating conditions of said electrolyzers.

<DESCRIPTION>
As is well-known, electrochemical plants comprise a multiplicity of 
electrolyzers, each one consisting in a plurality of elementary cells 
assembled in the so-called filter press arrangement, said elementary cells 
being electrically connected either in series (bipolar electrolyzers) or in 
parallel (monopolar electrolyzers). The electrolyzers are usually fed with a 
current up to 500 kA and a maximum voltage of 10 V in the case of 
monopolar electrolyzers, and with a current up to 20 kA and a maximum 
voltage of 300 Volts, in the case of bipolar electrolyzers. In standard operating conditions, when one of the electrolyzers is to be 
serviced, the electrolysis current fed to the whole plant has to be 
interrupted to permit maintenance or substitution of the electrolyzer to be 
serviced. A prolonged interruption of current to the whole plant (electrolysis circuit) 
causes not only a production loss but also possible damages to the 
internal components of the electrolyzers due to the remarkable shifts of 
temperature and pressure. In addition, with a prolonged interruption of 
current also auxiliary equipment of the plant, such as compressors, could 
be damaged. To avoid such a problem, the shut down as well as start-up 
operations require a substantial amount of time, as the current has to be 
respectively decreased or increased by small steps. The clear 
consequence of this is a further loss of production. In conventional plants, this problem is overcome by resorting to a jumper 
switch means providing for by-passing the electrolyzer to be service in  
 
the electrical circuit of the multiplicity of electrolyzers. To avoid 
interruption of the electrolysis process in the remaining electrolyzers, the 
by-pass (disconnection) and the connection of the electrolyzer, once 
serviced, takes place under electric current load. The electrolyzer to be serviced may be bypassed by utilizing copper bus-bars 
which are connected to the terminal contacts of the electrolyzer. As 
the current travelling across the plant is extremely high, the operation of 
connecting the bus-bars involves severe dangers. To overcome this problem, the short-circuiting bus-bars are provided with 
stationary contacts as well as mobile contacts, sliding over the stationary 
ones, which permits a full and safe operation. Further, the mobile 
contacts offer other advantages over the stationary ones, that is stability in 
the presence of vibrations, complete absorption of the thermal 
expansions, single contact series resistance. The contact
