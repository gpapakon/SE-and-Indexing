<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a color image-formable material which comprises 
a support, a cushion layer provided on the support 

and a color light-sensitive layer containing a light-sensitive 
composition and a coloring agent provided on the 

cushion layer and gives a transferred image by forming a 
color image portion by imagewise exposure and developing 

treatment and then transferring the color image portion 
alone to an image-receiving material,

 
   wherein the surface at a color light-sensitive layer 

side of the cushion layer has an average gloss (GS (60°)) 
of 30 or more and the color light-sensitive layer is 

provided on the cushion layer,
 

and a process for preparing the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color image-formable material 
suitable for preparing a color proof for color correction 
in color printing, a process for preparing the same and a 
method of forming a transferred image using the same, 
particularly to a color image-formable material by which a 
color proof more approximate to a print can be obtained, a 
process for preparing the same and a method of forming a 
transferred image using the same. It has been well known in this field of the art that a 
color sheet (also called a color proof) for color correction 
is used for the purpose of saving labor and time for 
proof printing which is carried out as a previous step of 
final printing in multicolor printing. As a method of forming a multicolor transferred image by 
using a color sheet for color correction, there may be 
mentioned, for example, a direct transfer method in which a 
color image is directly transferred to and laminated on a 
final image-receiving paper described in Japanese Provisional  
 
Patent Publication No. 41830/1972, an indirect 
transfer method in which a color image is temporarily 
transferred to a temporary (image-receiving) sheet 
described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 
97140/1984 and No. 189535/1986 and a method of repeating 
steps of transferring a color light-sensitive layer to an 
image-receiving paper and then forming an image described 
in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 50127/1981. In all of the methods described above, the surface of an 
image-receiving material on which an image is formed is 
covered with an organic polymer layer so that gloss of the 
surface of the resulting image is too high, whereby there 
is a problem of giving an impression different from quality 
of an image obtained by final printing. Particularly in 
the method of Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 
189535/1986, a non-image portion is covered with an organic 
polymer layer (a polymer layer), whereby there is a problem 
that inherent gloss and feel of a material cannot be 
obtained. In order to solve the above problems, there has been proposed 
a method in which only a color image is transferred 
to and laminated on an image-receiving material to obtain a 
multicolor image (Japanese Provisional Patent Publication 
No. 48248/1991). In this method, an image-receiving material 
is not covered with an organic polymer layer so that 
in principle, it is possible to obtain an image extremely 
approximate to quality of an image obtained by final printing. 
The present

<CLAIMS>
A color image-formable material which comprises a 
support, a cushion layer provided on the support and a 

color light-sensitive layer containing a light-sensitive 
composition and a coloring agent provided on the cushion 

layer and gives a transferred image by forming a color 
image portion by imagewise exposure and developing treatment 

and then transferring the color image portion alone to 
an image-receiving material, 

   wherein the surface at a color light-sensitive layer 
side of the cushion layer has an average gloss (GS (60°)) 

of 30 or more and the color light-sensitive layer is 
provided on the cushion layer. 
The material of Claim 1 wherein the cushion layer 
contains a polymer having vinyl carboxylate as a polymerization 

unit, and an amount of a polymerized portion 
derived from said vinyl carboxylate is 11 % by weight or 

less based on the total amount of the polymer.

light-sensitive layer side of the cushion layer has an 

average gloss (GS (60°)) of 70 or more.
