Apparatus for simulating a non-invasive medical examination of 
organs, in particular an echocraphic examination, comprising a manikin 

(1) representing all or part of a human body, said manikin (1), comprising 
a plurality of sensors, at least one means (4) for generating signals 

representative of a given physiological or physiopathological condition 
under the control of a central unit (2), the signal generating means (4) 

being adapted to be activated by a means (5) for exploration of said 
manikin (1), characterised in that said exploration means is a probe (5) 

comprising a zone for linear contact with the manikin, in which zone are 
disposed means intended to co-operate with groups (X
n
-X'
n
) of at least 
two sensors which are aligned along a common axis, each group defining 

for the linear contact zone of the probe which is placed on the skin of 
the manikin an azimulthal orientation in a plane passing through said 

common axis. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the sensors 
(10) are organised in a network in a plane and are connected at least in 

groups of two. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the probe (5) comprises at least one magnet adapted to stimulate at least 

two sensors in a plane passing through the axis defined by the two 
sensors. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that associated with each group of at least two sensors is an assembly of 

signals representative of the physiological or physiopathological 
condition. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the signals representative of the physiological or 

physiopathological condition are audio-visual data stored in memory means  
 

and which correspond for a given condition to each possible position of 
the probe (5) on the manikin (1). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the central unit (2) is adapted to receive signals 

emitted by the groups of sensors stimulated by the probe (5) and to 
control reading in the memory means of the corresponding audio-visual 

data with visualisation on a television monitor (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 characterised in that 
the memory means are formed by at least one video disc or a CD-I. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the sensors are of the magneto-resistive type. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the probe (5) comprises a switching means (8) for 

selection between two modes and that a cord (9) connecting the probe (5) 
to the central unit (2) permits the transmission of a signal 

representative of the choice between those two modes. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it comprises manual means for selecting in the 

central unit a physiological or physiopathological condition to be 
simulated. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that each group of sensors comprises two sensors 

disposed at a certain depth and a third sensor disposed at a different 
depth, such that activation of the three sensors involves for the 

exploration probe besides an azimuthal orientation defined by the first  
 

two sensors, an orientation in respect of site defined by the third 
sensor. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised by the association with a zone of exploration of the 

manikin of a network of two assemblies of sensors which are disposed at 
different depths below the skin of the manikin.
