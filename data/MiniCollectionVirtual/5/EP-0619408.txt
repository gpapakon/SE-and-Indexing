<ABSTRACT>
To the upper crosspiece 2 of the doorframe is fixed, projecting forwards, a motor casing 3 bearing a double U-shaped finger 5 which can turn between a position of rest in which access to the finger 5 is free towards the front, and a locked position in which the opening for the finger 5 is closed off by the crosspiece 2. On the swinging panel there is mounted, so that it can slide vertically, an upper roller 18 which is intended, when the panel is close to its closed position, to engage in the opening of the finger 5 which at that time is in the position of rest. The rotation of the finger 5 into its locked position, applies a positive traction to the door panel in order to bring it into the closed position. When the finger 5 is in the locked position, the roller 18 is trapped so that the door is locked. Actuation of a handle connected to the roller 18 makes it possible to cause the roller 18 to drop down, which manually unlocks the door. The invention makes it possible to achieve total closure of swinging doors, despite the contrary effect of the wind.
