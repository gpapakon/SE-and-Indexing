<ABSTRACT>
A measuring device has means (14) to determine 
distances and a visual display (32) arranged to display 

lines representing the distances. Preferably these are 
displayed so as to form a pictorial representation of the 

distances which have been determined. The directions of 
distances may be input through manually operable keys 

(64,66).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of electronic 
devices for measuring distances. A number of devices have been described which 
combine the measurement of length with electronic circuitry 
so as to provide a digital display of the distance measured 
and possibly carry out calculations utilising the distances 
measured. Examples are shown in US patent 4551847 
(Caldwell), European published patent application 169701 
(Fisco Electronics) and PCT published application WO 
88/00776 (Care). In such devices the visual display has 
been a digital display of the distance determined. According to the present invention there is 
provided a measuring device having means to determine 
distance and generate electronic data representing that 
distance, and means to store a plurality of such 
representations of distance, characterised by visual display 
means arranged to display a plurality of lines respectively 
representing the distances stored. The visual display can 
serve to provide the user with a visual analogue record that 
a distance has been measured. Preferably the device includes means to store data 
indicating a direction for each distance and the visual 
display means is arranged to display each line at an 
orientation representing the direction of the distance. 
Preferably also the visual display means is arranged to 
display each line at a position extending from the end of  
 
another line representing a previously measured distance so 
that the lines can form a drawing of the article. To assist 
this it is desirable that there should be control means 
enabling a user to reposition a line if required. A further preferred feature is that each line 
shown by the visual display means is shown with a length 
proportional to the distance which it represents. In a fairly basic form the device could for 
example be able to store a plurality of distances and 
assignment of those distances to either of two orthogonal 
directions (for example length and width). The visual 
display means would then be arranged to display the lines 
extending in each of two perpendicular directions, for 
instance length being displayed as horizontal lines and 
width being displayed as vertical lines. In a preferred arrangement the device has means to 
attribute any of three orthogonal directions to distances 
and the visual display means displays lines extending in 
either of two perpendicular directions or at an angle 
inclined to those directions, according to the direction of 
the distance represented by each line. Thus,
