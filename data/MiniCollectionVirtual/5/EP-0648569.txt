<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an engine driven arc welder adapted 
for converting a.c. output of welding generator into d.c. 

output to allow it to undergo switching control by using a 
switching circuit to detect an output of the switching 

circuit to control its ON/OFF period by the detected 
content to control a welding current. This engine driven 

arc welder further comprises a reference signal formation 
circuit for forming a reference signal such that when a 

detected voltage across welding terminals is higher than a 
first predetermined value, it has a first reference value, 

when that detected voltage is lower than a second 
predetermined value, it has a second reference value higher 

than the first reference value, and when that detected 
voltage is between the first and second predetermined 

values, it has a reference value of drooping characteristic 
continuously connecting the first and second reference 

values, thus to compare a detected signal at the welding 
terminal with the reference signal of the reference signal 

formation circuit to control the switching circuit. 
Further, this invention can be applied to an engine driven 

arc welder with load limiting function. In this case, AVR 
is employed in a feedback control loop for generator 

voltage. The circuit configuration includes a F/V 
characteristic circuit and an output suppression circuit 

for comparing a detected voltage of the welding generator 
with a predetermined reference voltage to deliver, when the 

detected voltage is lower than the reference voltage, a 
signal for suppressing a welding output to a constant 

current control circuit for controlling welding current so 
that it becomes equal to a fixed value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine driven arc welder
or welding machine in which the external output
characteristic is caused to have constant current
characteristic.Hitherto, in welding work by engine driven arc welders
used in outdoor construction works, manual welding is the
main current. In view of this, there has been
conventionally proposed a system in which power supply of
constant current characteristic having high stability of
arc is applied to the outdoor engine driven arc welder.
The circuit configuration of the conventional system is
shown in FIG. 10. In the system of FIG. 10, a chopper
circuit for providing general constant current
characteristic is constituted. Namely, an output from
generator 32 connected to engine 31 is rectified by
rectifier 33 and is then smoothed by smoothing capacitor 34
so that it is caused to be power having lower impedance
even when high speed operation of transistor is carried
out. Switching transistor 35 carries out ON/OFF operation
of power thus obtained at higher frequency and by large
current. Reactor 36 suppresses sudden increase or decrease
of current and smoothes output caused to undergo switching
by switching transistor 35, thus to stabilize the welding
condition. In FIG. 10, reference numerals 37, 38 denote
welding terminals, reference numeral 39 denotes a current
detector, reference numeral 40 denotes a constant current
control section, and reference numeral 41 denotes a
transistor drive section for driving switching transistor
35.However, with such welder of constant current
characteristics, in the case where high cellulose covered
or coated welding rod for which large short-circuit current 
is required is used, there was the problem that deposition
is apt to take place, giving rise to welding defect.As a method of increasing current at the time of
short-circuit of welding, the apparatus described in
Jikkohei No. 4-35007 (Japanese Utility Model Publication
No. 35007/1992) has been proposed. In accordance with the
apparatus abovementioned, within current control circuit
using thyristor, a detected value of arc current detecting
circuit is delivered to current setting circuit to carry
out adjustment of detection level to compare that detected
value with reference value at firing circuit via output
characteristic switching circuit thus to carry out phase
control. The technology of the apparatus contemplates
suddenly increasing current at the time of short-circuit.
Further, there is proposed, in the Tokkaihei No. 5-185226
(Japanese Patent Application Laid
