<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a polybutene amine 
composition comprises the steps of reacting a chlorinated 

polybutene with an excess of at least one mole of at least 
one type of an amine compound per mole of the chlorinated 

polybutene at a reaction temperature of at least about 
100°C; neutralizing the reaction mixture with a base 

selected from the group of alkali metal and alkaline earth 
metal alkoxides and amides with formation of one of an 

alcohol or ammonia, respectively; neutralizing any excess 
base with an acid that will produce essentially no water as 

a by-product; and recovering the polybutene amine 
composition, the process including the steps of removing the 

alcohol or ammonia in a timely fashion; and removing excess 
of the amine compound. 
The present invention allows the manufacture of 
polybutene amine fuel deposit control additives, w
ithout the 
undesired by-products or environmental disadvantages of 

prior art procedures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to preparing 
polybutene amine fuel additives and, more particularly, to 
an improved process of producing polybutene amine deposit 
control additives in the absence of water, wherein excess 
amine reactant is recovered. The present invention also 
relates to a process for the recovery of amine salts from a 
variety of amine-containing waste streams. Deposit-control fuel additives effectively control 
deposits in carburettors, valves and fuel injectors of 
engine intake systems. Aminated polybutenes are widely 
employed as deposit control fuel additives. Aminated 
polybutenes are produced commercially by one of two 
processes which involve the reaction of chlorinated 
polybutene with an amine compound to produce a polybutene 
amine. These prior art processes, however, are 
characterized by the preparation of undesirable side-products 
and the creation of a large volume of contaminated 
aqueous waste streams. U.S. patent no. 3,671,511 represents the primary 
process currently employed to produce polybutene amines. 
It involves the reaction of chlorinated polybutene with an 
excess of polyamine, stripping the excess amine under 
vacuum, adding aromatic solvent to dilute the reaction 
mixture, and neutralizing the reaction mixture with aqueous 
sodium hydroxide. This step forms an emulsion which is 
broken by adding butanol. The phases are separated and the  
 
organic layer is washed several times before being dried and 
diluted with the desired solvent. This process has many 
disadvantages. One mole of excess amine per mole of reacted 
chlorinated polybutene is not recovered during stripping and 
ultimately is discarded in an aqueous layer. This results 
in the loss of a valuable raw material and is an economic 
and environmental disadvantage. The large volume of aqueous 
waste streams which contain amine, traces of aromatic 
solvent, and butanol represents a serious disposal problem 
and an economic as well as an environmental disadvantage. 
The butanol adds to the cost of the process since it cannot 
be recovered, and the necessity of performing multiple 
washes increases cycle time and manufacturing costs. U.S. patent no. 3,454,555 describes the second 
most frequently used process to prepare polybutene amines 
and describes a system which overcomes many process-related 
problems associated with aqueous waste streams, lost butanol 
and amine, and multiple washes. It has a different problem, 
however, which renders its product unacceptable to the 
customer. This process
