<ABSTRACT>
Mechanical transmission component (1) consisting on the one hand of a male element of cylindrical shape (5) and, on the other hand, a female element of annular shape (4) engaged over the male element (5) between the two ends (5, 5') of the latter, characterised in that the female element (4) at the internal periphery of its two lateral faces (4, 4') has notched teeth (9) engaged in the material of the male element (5).

Mechanical transmission part comprising, on the one hand, a male element of
cylindrical shape (5) being part of a differential casing and, on the other hand, a

female element (4) such as a differential crown wheel engaged between the two
ends of the male element (5), the male element (5) having at one of its ends (5') a

heel (7) orthogonal to its outside surface and, at its second end (5''), a collar (6)
extending the latter in the outward direction, characterised in that the female

element (4) has at the internal periphery of its two lateral faces (4') notches (9)
engaged in the material of the male element (5).
Mechanical part according to Claim 1 characterised in that the male element (5)
has excess material (10) at the base of the heel (7).
Mechanical part according to Claim, 2, characterised in that the male element (5)
has a recess (11) formed in the heel (7) above the surplus material (4).
Mechanical part according to Claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised in the notches (9) of
a first lateral face (4') of the female element (4) are embedded in the excess

material (10).
Method of assembling a mechanical part according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that it comprises the following steps:


heating up the female element (4),
offering up and engaging the female element (4) on the male element up to the
heel (7) of the latter bringing about the embedding of the notches (9) of a first

lateral face (4') of the element (4) in the material of the male element (5). 
deformation of the collar (6) in such as way as to fold it up against the female
element (4) whilst pushing back the material between the notches (9) of a

second lateral face (4') of the latter.
Method of assembly a mechanical part according to Claim 5, characterised in that
the notches of the first lateral face (4') are embedded in the excess material (10)

provided at the base of the heel (7), in such a way as to push the material back
inside a recess (11) formed for this purpose in the body of the heel(7).
