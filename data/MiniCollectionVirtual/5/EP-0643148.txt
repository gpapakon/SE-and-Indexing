<ABSTRACT>
A steel material for induction-hardened 
shaft parts which is prevented 

from causing hardening crack and has an 
excellent torsional strength of 160 kgf/mm² 

or above, and a shaft part made therefrom. 
The steel material comprises: 0.35-0.70 % 

of carbon, over 0.15 to 2.5 % of silicon, 
0.2-1.5 % of manganese, 0.20-1.5 % of 

chromium, 0.05-0.5 % of molybdenum, 
0.015-0.05 % of aluminum, 0.002-0.02 

% of nitrogen, and reduced amounts of 
phosphorus, copper and oxygen, and, 

occasionally, specified amounts of titanium, 
boron and other element(s). The shaft 

part is made from this material and has 
a mean sectional hardness HVa of 560 or 

above, and/or an austenite grain size of 
the induction-hardened layer of No. 9 or 

above, and/or a surface residual stress of 
-80 kgf/mm² or below.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steel product for
an induction-hardened shaft component and a shaft
component using the steel product. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a steel product suitable
for a shaft component, constituting a power train system
in an automobile, such as a shaft provided with splines,
a shaft provided with a flange and a shaft provided with
a casing as shown in Figs. 1(a) to 1(c), and an
induction-hardened shaft component having excellent
torsional strength. In Figs. 1 (a) to 1(c), numeral 10
designates a shaft, numerals 11, 12 designate serrations,
numerals 20, 21 designate shafts, numeral 22 designates a
flange, numerals 30, 31, 32 designates shafts and
numeral 33 designates a casing.Shaft components constituting a power train systems
in automobiles have been generally been produced by
forming a medium carbon steel into a desired component
and then subjecting the components to induction hardening
and tempering. In recent years, however, there has been
a strong demand for an increase in strength (an
improvement in torsional strength) due to the increase in
engine output of automobile engines and to cope with
environmental regulations.Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No.
63-62571 discloses a process for producing a drive shaft
comprising the steps of: forming a steel comprising C:
0.30 to 0.38%, Mn: 0.6 to 1.5%, B: 0.0005 to 0.0030%, Ti:
0.01 to 0.04% and Al: 0.01 to 0.04% into a drive shaft
and subjecting the drive shaft to induction hardening in
such a manner that the ratio of the induction hardening
depth to the radius of the steel member is not less than 
0.4. As can be seen from Fig. 1 of the same publication,
the maximum attainable torsional strength is about
160 kgf/mm2.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No.
4-218641 discloses that the use of a steel product for a
high-strength shaft component produced using a particular
composition system characterized by low Si and high Mn
contents, i.e., comprising Si: not more than 0.05% and
Mn: between 0.65% and 1.7%, enables a torsional strength
of 140 to 160 kgf/mm2 to be obtained in a component
provided with a spline.Thus, the maximum torsional strength attainable in
the art is about 160 kgf/mm2.However, the above torsional strength level of
160 kgf/mm2 cannot be said to be satisfactory for shaft
components in power train systems for automobiles.
Further, the prevention of quench crack in the course of
the production of the components has become important.EP-A-0 461 652 discloses a flat
