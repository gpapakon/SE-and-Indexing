<ABSTRACT>
In this bicycle the pedal motion is transmitted on both sides by means of a drive train (10), via a deflecting means (5) arranged under the saddle, to the freewheels (33) in the rear wheel. The opposed peddling motion is produced by connecting the two drive trains via a further deflecting means (7) in front of the rear wheel.   The component parts comprising the pedals (8), the elements (20) and the rear wheel hub (32) are mounted on a common knock-out spindle (11), the driving mechanism and the drive trains (10) being accommodated in the frame in a manner such that they are protected from external influences and it being possible for them also to remain there when the rear wheel is removed. To change the transmission ratio the points (9) of engagement of the drive trains with the pedals (8) can be infinitely displaced by pivotable handlebars (2) via Bowden cables (50 and 51) .

Pedal lever driven vehicle, in particular a cycle having a vehicular structure with rear wheel
forks (20) for attaching the drive axle (11) of the drive wheel and having pedal levers (8) located on the

drive axle (11), which is driven by a common or two separate drive linkage(s) (10) moved by the pedal
levers (8) by means of two free-wheel mechanisms (33) acting on the hub (32) of the drive wheel

characterised in that the drive linkage(s) (10) act directly on torsionally resistive drive elements (18) of
sleeves (15), which, on the one hand, can be rotated with the rear wheel forks (20) and, on the other

hand, are axially separated by way of a coupling device, interconnected in each instance by way of
another sleeve (35) with the free-wheel mechanisms (33), and that the drive axle (11) is designed as a

full floating axle, on which the free-wheel mechanisms (33), the hub (32) and one or the other sleeves
(15 
&
 35) are located.
Pedal lever driven vehicle as claim 1, characterised in that with the fully floating axle (11) all
components located thereon are tensioned by means of nuts or quick-securing clamps together with

the rear wheel forks (20) to form a stable unit.
Pedal lever driven vehicle as claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the location of the components
is effected by means of loose and/ or secured sleeves (17/1 to 17/3) connected to one or a plurality of

components.
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the rear
wheel forks (20) are box shaped and that the sleeves (15) are arranged with the drive elements (18)

within the cavities (52) surrounded by the rear wheel forks.
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to claim 4, characterised in that the hub (32) has
peripheral segmental scallops (29) on the end faces for acceptance of spoke heads for the drive

wheel, which are covered by the box shaped rear wheel forks (20).
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to any of the claims 1 to 5, that the drive linkage(s) (10) at
least run(s) partially within the structure of the vehicle.
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to any of the claims 1 to 6 having a rotatable fork (45)
attached to the frame for acceptance of the front wheel, which is controlled by a steering tube (2) and

with which the points of contact (9) of the drive linkage (10) to the pedal levers (8) are adjustable,
characterised in that the adjustment is effected by means of an adjustment device by a sliding action

of the steering tube (2) in the direction of travel.
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to claim 7, characterised in that the steering tube (2) is
attached to an auxiliary fork (1), which is hinged on the fork (45) of the cycle and is movable along a

steering front part (3) and can be fixed to the said part in a chosen position and that to the steering
tube (2) are filled two switch action drawing devices (50,51), which control slides (21) located to slide

on the pedal levers (8), to which the drive linkage(s) (10) are attached.
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to claim 8, characterised in that the steering tube (2)
features therein a axle (43), which is securely connected to prevent rotation to a toothed wheel (42),

the wheel meshing in a toothed rack (44) of the front part (3) of the steering system, and that the axle
(43) is securely connected to two handles (48), the rotary position of which in relation to the steering

tube (2) can be fixed.
Pedal lever driven vehicle according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the slides (21) are
controlled directly by means of a switch action drawing device (50) and by means of another switch

action drawing device (51) after diversion by a roller (23) on the pedal end of the pedal lever (8).
