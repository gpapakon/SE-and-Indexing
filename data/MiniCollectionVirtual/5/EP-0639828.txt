<ABSTRACT>
A duplicator for dubbing magnetic information 
along with a periodical synchronizing signal produced 

at uniform intervals from a mother tape to a slave 
tape. A coded signal is recorded on the slave tape in 

synchronism with the periodical synchronizing signal. 
A loading apparatus for loading a slave tape into a 

cassette. The slave tape has a magnetic information 
recorded thereon along with a periodical synchronizing 

signal produced at uniform intervals. The loading 

apparatus reproduce a coded signal recorded on the 
slave signal in synchronism with the periodical 

synchronizing signal. The magnetic information 
recording and reproducing apparatus may use a magnetic 

medium having the periodical synchronizing signal and 
the coded signal recorded thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic information 
recording/reproducing apparatus and a magnetic medium 
for use therewith. Magnetic information recording apparatus have been 
used for high-speed dubbing of video and/or audio 
signals from a mother tape to a slave tape placed in a 
tape-on-tape contact with the mother tape. Magnetic 
information reproducing apparatus have been used for 
automatically loading of a slave tape having video 
and/or audio signals dubbed thereto into a cassette. 
For such magnetic information and reproducing 
apparatus, it is the current practice to record a code 
on slave and/or mother tapes for quality management and 
production management. Fig. 6 shows a typical format of a tape code 
recorded on a mother or slave tape TA. The tape TA has 
front and rear blank sections 1S and 1E respectively at 
its front and rear ends. The tape TA also has a start 
cue section 2S in rear of the front blank section 1S 
substantially intermediate between the opposite sides 
of the tape TA and an end cue section 2E in front of 
the rear blank section 1E substantially intermediate 
between the opposite sides of the tape TA. The start 
cue section 2S has a start cue signal recorded thereon 
and the end cue section 2E has an end cue signal 
recorded thereon. The tape TA has a start gray video 
section 3S in rear of the start cue section 2S and a 
program section 4 in rear of the start gray video 
section 3S. The program section 4 has a program  
 
software video signal recorded thereon. A control track 
section (CTL) 5 is provided below the start gray video 
and program sections 3S and 4. The tape TA has an end 
gray video section 3E in rear of the program section 4 
and in front of the end cue section 2E. A code interval 
6 is provided below the end gray video section 3E. As shown in Fig. 7, the code interval 6 comprises 
450 bits (corresponding to 90 seconds). The front half 
comprised of 225 bits includes a 10 length cell (10LC) 
and a global section 6a in rear of the 10 length cell. 
The global section 6a is used for storing information 
related to the items such as a system identification, 
a catalogue number, a country number, a mother tape 
identification, a mother tape length, a title format 
(for example, NTSC) or the like to be managed. The rear 
half comprised of 225 bits includes a local section 6b 
and a 10 LC provided in rear of the local section. The 
local section 6b is used for storing items such as a 
tape stock, a copy data, a copy time, a transfer 
number, a tape type, a
