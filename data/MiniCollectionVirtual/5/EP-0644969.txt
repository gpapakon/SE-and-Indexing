<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMALLY INSULATING MULTIPANE GLAZING STRUCTURETechnical FieldThe present invention relates generally to multipane glazing structures, and more particularly relates to the use of thermally insulative spacers in novel multipane glazing structures which have exceptional thermal insulation performance. The invention also relates to the interpane spacers.BackgroundMultipane glazing structures have been in use for some time as thermally insulating windows, in residential, commercial and industrial contexts. Examples of such structures may be found in U.S. Patent Nos.3,499,697, 3,523,847 and 3,630,809 to Edwards, 4,242,386 to Weinlich, 4,520,611 to Shingu et al. , and 4,639,069 to Yatabe et al. While each of these patents relates to laminated glazing structures which provide better insulation performance than single-pane windows, increasing energy costs as well as demand for a superior product have given rise to a need for windows of even higher thermal insulation ability.A number of different kinds of approaches have been taken to increase the thermal insulation performance of windows. Additional panes have been incorporated into a laminated structure, as disclosed in several of the above-cited patents; typically, incorporation of additional panes will increase the R-value of the structure from R-l for a single-pane window to R-2 for a 

double laminate, to R-3 for a structure which includes 3 or more panes (with "R-values" defined according to the insulation resistance test set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials in the Annual Book of ASTM Standards) . Southwall Technologies Inc., the assignee of the present invention, has promoted such a triple-glazing structure which employs two glass panes containing an intermediate plastic film. Such products are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,335,166 to Lizardo et al.In multiplane structures two or more glazing panes are positioned in a spaced parallel relationship to one another by reason of spacers located at the periphery of the glazing panes. An effective spacer should have structural integrity and a substantial level of crush strength so as to allow a dimensionally stable window unit to be formed.Spacers used heretofore have ranged from solid or open metal or plastic constructs to hollow metal, plastic, or composite tubes of circular, rectangular or irregular cross-sections, with continuous or discontinuous peripheries. Hollow spacers are often filled with desiccant to minimize interpane water content and condensation problems
