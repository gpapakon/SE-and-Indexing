<ABSTRACT>
From a population of randomly mutated plants, produced by the action of chemical mutagens on pollen or seed, a plant may be isolated by growing the mutant population in the presence of the herbicide clomazone. This plant is resistant to normally lethal doses, that is herbicidally effective doses, of that herbicide. Clomazone may thus be used for weed control in tolerant crops where hitherto the sensitivity of the crop would have precluded such use.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HERBICIDE RESISTANT PLANTSThis invention relates to herbicide resistant maize plants.The purpose in providing crop plants which resist the action of a herbicide is to facilitate the destruction of weeds growing between the plants by the overall application of a herbicidally effective concentration of a herbicide which would destroy the crop plant in its normal, that is herbicide sensitive, state. Such resistant plants are also useful for use in a locus of any short term carry-over of herbicide from a previous crop.Methods are known by which populations of plants may be obtained which contain a great number of random mutations. Such methods include tissue culture techniques where spontaneous somaclonal variation occurs in the presence or absence of a utagen. By applying to the cultures some form of selection pressure it is possible to recover cells which resist that pressure. Depending on the plant species it is sometimes possible to regenerate whole plants from the resistant cells. Such tissue culture selection methods have been used in the past to select for resistance to herbicides.Neuffer and Coe [Maydica XXIII (1978) 21-28; pa e 21] have described a procedure for corn(maize) pollen mutagenesis using mutagens suspended 

 in light paraffin oil, followed by pollination of a recipient plant with the mutagenized pollen. As reported, there is no indication that any attempt was ever made to locate and isolate commercially important mutants and, although it is said that the resulting plants were examined for mutants, no details are given as to the properties of any mutants which may have been found, probably by visual inspection. In Plant Breeding Reviews _ยง_, pages 39 to 180,Bird and Neuffer review the uses of mutagenic processes to produce variation in maize. Pollen mutagenesis is discussed at pages 150 and 151. Pollen mutagenesis gives a relatively high frequency of variation in the M- generation compared with other available procedures. However, no suggestion is made in respect of the use of pollen mutagenesis for generation of mutants which display resistance to herbicide action. Section III (page 149) describes some of the difficulties of the use of mutagenesis as a source of genetic variation. One important aspect is the method by which the population of putative mutants is screened for useful phenotypes. Mutagenesis, of pollen or seed, has previously been used to generate large populations of random mutations in plants. It is generally the case, however, that few mutants of commercial importance
