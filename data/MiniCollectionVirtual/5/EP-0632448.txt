<ABSTRACT>
A method of assembling a magnetic tape cassette, and a 
cassette are provided in which a magnetic shield plate and a 

plate spring having a pad attached thereto are incorporated 
very easily into upper and lower cassette halves and are free 

from chattering. The lower edge of the magnetic shield plate 
20 fits into a groove, which is formed on a lower cassette 

half, and both ends of the plate spring 30 are dropped into 
receiving grooves at the front ends of projections formed on 

the lower cassette half. Thereafter, the upper cassette half, 
having ribs 26 and 36 which contact with the upper edges of the 

magnetic shield plate 20 and the plate spring 30, is placed on 
the lower cassette half, and the ribs are then melted by an 

ultrasonic welder. The magnetic shield plate and the plate 
spring are held by the molten resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic tape cassette and
a method of assembling a magnetic tape cassette in which a
plate spring having a press pad is disposed in the vicinity of
a magnetic head hole which opens on the front face of the body
case of the cassette consisting of upper and lower cassette
halves, and a magnetic shield plate is disposed behind the
plate spring.Recently, as in the case of digital audio tape
recorders and other electronic devices, cassette tape recorders
are improving in the areas of miniaturization, lightness in
weight, and performance. Correspondingly, audio magnetic tape
cassettes need to enhance their performance and undergo various
improvements.Figs. 6 to 8 show the basic structure of an audio
magnetic tape cassette of the prior art
as known, for instance, from US-A-4 735 378.
As shown in Fig. 6,
in the magnetic tape cassette, a hollow inner space, which is
defined by a pair of upper and lower cassette halves 1 and 2
(the upper cassette half is not shown), is divided into a
record/reproduction region 4 and a hub housing region 5 by a
partition 3.In the hub housing region 5, hubs 12, rotation guide
rollers 13, etc. are disposed so as to be symmetrical about the
center line C, which elongates along the longitudinal 
direction, i.e., front and rear direction, of the cassette. In
the record/reproduction region 4, capstan holes 6, cassette
positioning holes 7, head pins 8, etc. are formed so as to be
symmetrical about the center line C. A plate spring 10, which
is a plate-like supporting member and which supports a press
pad 9, is disposed behind the head pins 8, and a shield plate
20 is disposed behind the plate spring 10.As shown in Fig. 8, when a record or reproduction
process is to be conducted, a magnetic head 15 of a
record/reproduction device is inserted into the
record/reproduction region 4 through a magnetic head hole 14 on
the front face of the cassette, and the front end of the
magnetic head 15 pushes a magnetic tape T together with the
press pad 9 into the cassette. As a result, the portion of the
magnetic tape T extending between the paired head pins 8 is
pressed against a head gap formed at the front end of the
magnetic head 15, by the tension of the magnetic tape T and the
urging force of the plate spring 10.As shown in Fig. 7, the shield plate 20 has a U-like
shape in the plan view and is positioned and fixed by fitting
the upper edge 211 and the lower edge 212 of the shield body 21
into narrow grooves formed on the upper and lower cassette
halves 1 and 2. As shown

A method of assembling a magnetic tape cassette
comprising; upper (1) and lower (2) cassette halves, a plate spring (30)

having a press pad (9) attached thereto in the vicinity of a front
opening (14) in said cassette for receiving a magnetic head (15), said

plate spring (30) being located behind head pins (8), and a magnetic
shield plate (20) is disposed behind said plate spring (30), said method

comprising the steps of:

fittingly positioning the lower edge (212) of said magnetic
shield plate (20) into a shield plate-groove (29) formed on an inner

surface of said lower cassette half (2);
dropping both left and right ends of said plate spring (30)
into respective receiving groove (310) at the upper ends of a pair of

projections (31) formed on said lower cassette half (2) ;
placing said upper cassette half (1), having resin ribs (26,36)
located thereon, on said lower cassette half (2) so that said upper

half (1) and lower half (2) mate and said ribs (26,36) contact the upper edge (211)
of said magnetic shield plate (20) and the upper edge of said plate

spring (30) ;
melting said ribs (26,36) by an ultrasonic welder (60) to fix the
position of said magnetic shield plate (20) within said cassette and

to hold said plate spring (30) at least in the longitudinal
direction of said cassette.
The method of claim 1, wherein said projections (31)
formed on said lower cassette half (2) are two in number, and said

upper cassette half (1) has two suspended portions (32) at positions
corresponding to said two projections (31), and wherein said step of

placing said upper cassette half (1), comprises: positioning said
