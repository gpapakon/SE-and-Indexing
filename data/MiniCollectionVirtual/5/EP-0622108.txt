<ABSTRACT>
In a cement producing process the nitrogen oxide gases are removed from the off-gas leaving a rotating tube furnace at 750-950 deg C by adding ammonia in a ratio of NOx NH3 of 1.08 to 1:1. The gases are then passed over a catalyst at 300 to 450, pref 350-400 deg C whose active substance is iron sulphate or a mixture of iron sulphate and manganese sulphate.

A process for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases 
resulting from the manufacture of cement, characterized 

in that ammonia is added to the exhaust gas when the same 
has left the rotary-tube furnace at a temperature of 750 

to 950°C, where the ratio of NO
x
:NH
3
 = 1:0.8 to 1:1, and 
that the exhaust gas is brought in contact with
 a catalyst 
at a temperature of 300 to 450°C, which catalyst 

contains iron sulfate or a mixture of iron sulfate and 
manganese sulfate as active substance. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
ammonia is added to the exhaust gas at a temperature of 

800 to 900°C, and that the exhaust gas is brought in contact 
with the catalyst at a temperature of 350 to 400°C. 
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 2, characterized in 
that crystalline iron sulfate or a mixture of crystalline 

iron sulfate and crystalline manganese sulfate is used as 
catalyst, where the catalyst has a particle size of 50 to 

500 µm and is distributed in the exhaust gas stream before 
the uppermost cyclone of the preheater. 
The process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the catalyst is added to the exhaust gas in an amount of 

0.1 to 3 g/Nm
3
. 
The process as claimed in claims 3 to 4, characterized in 
that iron sulfate and manganese sulfate (calculated as 

FeSO
4
 and MnSO
4
) are mixed in a weight ratio of 3:1 to 
5:1.  

 
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 2, characterized in 
that the catalyst is brought in contact with the exhaust 

gas in a fluidized bed, that the fluidized bed replaces 
the uppermost cyclone of the preheater, and that the 

catalytically active substance of the catalyst is applied 
on a substrate, where the substrate has a particle diameter 

of 0.5 to 5 mm and consists of SiO
2
, Al
2
O
3
 or alumosilicates. 
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that before entrance into the uppermost cyclone of the 

preheater or into the fluidized bed of the preheater, 
partially calcined raw meal is supplied to the exhaust 

gas.
