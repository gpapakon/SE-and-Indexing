<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a temperature distribution
measuring device and measuring method for measuring a
distribution of radiant temperature using an infrared beam
sensor of pyroelectric type and others.A need for measuring a temperature distribution within
a room to detect an existence of a person and an amount of
activity thereof has been increasing in recent years in the
fields of security and air-conditioning.In the prior art, there is known a method to find a
distribution of temperature by using a two-dimensional
quantum type solid imaging infrared sensor as a device for
measuring a temperature distribution in a space such as a
room by detecting infrared beam.On the other hand, as a method for finding a spatial 
temperature distribution using a low cost pyroelectric type
sensor as an infrared sensor, there is known a method of
using a single pyroelectric type sensor to detect an input
energy in every each direction by scanning directionally in
the vertical and horizontal directions mechanistically to
find the spatial temperature distribution, as described in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 64/88391, 57/185695, 2/183752
and 2/196932.However, since the method of using the aforementioned
quantum type solid imaging infrared sensor requires to cool
down the detecting section thereof, though its temperature
measuring accuracy and resolution are high, it is expensive
and is not suitable to use for domestic appliances. On the
other hand, the method of using the pyroelectric type sensor
has a problem that its spatial resolution and temperature
resolution are low due to its complicated mechanism for
carrying out the directional scanning and to its complicated
signal processing. It is an object of the present invention to solve the problem of the prior art by providing a low
cost temperature distribution measuring device, and a measuring method having higher spatial
resolution and temperature resolution.This object is achieved with a temperature distribution measuring device having the features of
claim 1 and a temperature distribution measuring method having the features of claim 16.Preferred embodiments are the subject matter of the dependent claims.

measuring device according to a first embodiment of
