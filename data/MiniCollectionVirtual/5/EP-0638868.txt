<ABSTRACT>
Described is a parallel processing architecture following 
the Single Instruction stream Multiple Data stream execution 

paradigm where a controller element (18) is connected to at 
least one processing element (10) with a local memory (38) having 

a local memory address shift register (46) adapted to receive 
and retain therein a globally broadcast memory base register 

address value received from the controller element (18) for 
use by the processing element for access and transfer of data 

between the processing element (10) and its respective local 
memory (38). A computer architecture for implementing indirect 

addressing and look-up tables includes a processing element 
shift register (44) associated with the at least one processing 

element (10) and adapted to receive and retain therein a local 
memory offset address value calculated or loaded by the associated 

processing element (10) in accord with a first predetermined 
set of instructions. The processing element shift register 

(44) transfers its contents bitwise to the local memory shift 
register (46) of the local memory (38) associated with the 

processing element (10), with the bit value of the most significant 
bit position being sequentially transferred to the least 

significant bit position of the local memory shift register 
(46) in accord with a second predetermined set of instructions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to computer architectures, 
and, more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for enabling 
indirect addressing and lookup table implementation on Single 
Instruction stream Multiple Data stream (SIMD) multi-processor 
architectures. In existing SIMD computer architectures, memory is generally 
accessed by the processor array as a single plane of memory 
locations. In conventional SIMD architectures, the memory address 
location is broadcast, along with the instruction word, to all 
processing elements by the controller. This configuration 
normally results in the processing elements accessing a single 
plane of data in memory. Offsets from this plane of data cannot 
be done using this architecture, as there is no provision for 
specifying, or modifying, the local memory address associated 
with each processor based on local data in each processor. As a consequence of this lock-step approach, it is 
especially difficult to implement efficiently indirect addressing 
and look-up tables in a parallel processing architecture 
following the Single Instruction stream Multiple Data stream 
execution paradigm. Indirect addressing requires serialization 
of operations and thus uses O(N) cycles to perform the memory 
access in an N processor system. Generally, the present invention is embodied in a method and 
computer architecture for implementing indirect addressing and 
look-up tables in a parallel processing architecture following 
the Single Instruction stream Multiple Data stream execution 
paradigm.  SIMD architecture utilizes a controller element connected 
to an array of processing elements where each processing element 
has associated with it a local memory that has a local memory 
address shift register. The local memory address shift register 
is adapted to receive and retain a globally broadcast memory base 
register address value received from the host, or from the 
controller element, for use by the processing element in 
accessing and transferring data between the processing element 
and its respective local memory. Each of the processing elements is further associated with 
a processing element shift register that is adapted to receive 
and retain a local memory offset address value calculated or 
loaded by the processing element in accord with a first 
predetermined set of instructions. The processing element shift 
register is also further adapted to transfer its contents bitwise 
to the local memory shift register of its associated local 
memory, with the
