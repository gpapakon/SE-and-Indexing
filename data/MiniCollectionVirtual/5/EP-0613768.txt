<ABSTRACT>
The dividers are fabricated to variable formats in a machine that transports (1) the sheets of cardboard to a cutting and folding area (2), then removes (3) them. The cutting and folding area has a shaping well (20) with a wall (21) mobile in translation, driven by two motorised screws (22) that also position the machine (27) that fastens the walls of the divider. This machine is controlled by a programmable controller set by the user to produce the required format from various stored formats.
