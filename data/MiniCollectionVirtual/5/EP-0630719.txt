<ABSTRACT>
Projection welding is used to join a needle guide member (30) and 
a valve seat member (32) together preparatory to their assembly into the 

nozzle of a fuel injector. Various embodiments are disclosed, including 
various ways for creating the projections (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fluid valves, particularly fuel
injectors, and to methods relating to the manufacture of such valves.One type of fuel injector that is used for injecting fuel into an
internal combustion engine comprises a valve element in the form of a
needle that is reciprocated by an operating mechanism to seat on and
unseat from a valve seat member thereby alternately closing and opening
a passageway through it. For aiding in guiding the reciprocation of the
needle, a needle guide member is disposed proximate the valve seat
member.The present invention relates to a new way to join a needle guide
member and a valve seat member together.First, it should be recognized that certain needle guide members
and valve seat members are already commonly joined by using machined
fixtures, pressing, clamping, laser welding, or resistance welding. Welding
of a needle guide member to a valve seat member in a precise locating
fixture is superior to other methods in cost and/or precision. Resistance
welding works well when the design of the components is suitable and the
contact area is small. The present invention solves the problem of
welding these components when their design is not suitable for the
previous techniques. Because of valve functional requirements, the design of the
two components for which the present invention has been
developed requires that they have relatively large flat surface
areas that mutually abut. They cannot be successfully resistance
welded because the manufacturing techniques employed to
fabricate them do not consistently produce surfaces of sufficient
flatness for resistance welding to be suitable. Attempts to
resistance weld these surfaces are apt to result in distortions of
the components which although seemingly small are nevertheless
sufficiently large that they may impair proper functionality of a
precision device like a fuel injector.Germany document 'Handbuch der Schweißtechnik', J Ruge,
Band II, Springer-Verlag 1980, pages 100, 111, refers in
particular that when large surfaces have to be joined by
resistance welding, a concentration of welding energy is
necessary. Fig. 10-118d illustrates projections. The thrust of the
document is the welded of LARGE surfaces which are generally
not required to be welded with the precision required in fuel
injectors. There is no reference dealing with such precision.According to the present invention there is provided a
combination of a seat member and a guide member for a fuel
injector in which the seat and guide members

<CLAIMS>
The combination of a seat member (32) and a guide member
(30) for a fuel injector (18) in which the seat and guide members

(30, 32) share a common main longitudinal axis and have
respective surface portions (48, 50), which surface portions (48,

50) are complimentary to each other and confront each other
when said guide member (30) and said seat member (32) are

joined,

   characterized by

one of said seat (32) and said guide (30) members having a
frusto conical surface (54), which adjoins said one member (30,

32), wherein weld projections (52) are disposed on one of said
surface portions (45, 50) of said guide member (30) and said seat

member (32) for engaging said surface portion (48, 50) of the
other of said guide member (30) and said seat member (32)

preparatory to joining of said seat member (32) and said guide
member (30) by conducting welding current through said seat

member (32) and said guide member (30) so that said weld
projections melt and form welds joining said members (30, 32),

and for each weld projection (52) a corresponding depression (56)
disposed immediately adjacent and adjoining each of said weld

projections (52) in said frusto conical surface (54) so that as said
weld projections melt and join said seat member (32) to said

guide member (30) excess molten weld is received by said
depression (56) away from said contacting surface portions

thereby joining
 
said seat and said guide members (30, 32) unfettered by said

excess weld.
The combination as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said
depressions (56) are formed in said frusto conical surface (54),

substantially above said weld projections (52), in a plane parallel
to the main longitudinal axis.
The combination as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein said
depressions (56) and said weld projections (32) are created by a

tool with a pointed tip that is advanced into said frusto conical
surface (54) so that the fit between said seat member (32) and

said guide member (30) provided by said surface portions (48,
50) in combination with said weld projections (52) may be tested

before joining.
The combination as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein
there are three such weld projections (52), and corresponding

depressions (56), arranged one hundred and twenty degrees apart
about the main longitudinal axis.
