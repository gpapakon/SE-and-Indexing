<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the synthesis of non-zeolitic
molecular sieves. More particularly, the method relates to non-zeolitic
molecular sieves which may be synthesized from an aqueous reaction
mixture having a Al2O3:P2O5 molar ratio greater than 0.3.Recently, there have been reported several classes of microporous
compositions which are not zeolitic, and which will collectively be referred to
hereinafter as "non-zeolitic molecular sieves", which term will be more
precisely defined hereinafter. These materials are formed from [AlO2] and
[PO2] tetrahedra and have electrovalently neutral frameworks, for example, as
in the case of silica polymorphs and include the crystalline
aluminophosphate compositions disdosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,310,440 issued
January 12, 1982 to Wilson et al., the disclosure 
Classes of aluminophosphate compositions comprise AlPO4, SAPO
(silicoaluminophosphate), MeAPO (metalloaluminophosphate), and ElAPO
(nonmetal substituted aluminophosphate families). Uses for crystalline
aluminophosphate compositions have included molecular sieves, catalysts,
and catalyst carriers.U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,871, issued on April 3, 1984 to Lok et al.,
describes a class of
silicon-substituted aluminophosphate non-zeolitic molecular sieves which
are both microporous and crystalline. These materials have a three-dimensional
crystal framework of [PO2], [AlO2] and [SiO2] tetrahedral units
and, exclusive of any alkali metal or calcium which may optionally be
present, an as-synthesized empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous
basis of:
mR:(Six AlyPz)O2
wherein "R" represents at least one organic templating agent present in the
intracrystalline pore system; "m" represents the moles of "R" present per
mole of (Six AlyPz)O2 and has a value of from zero to 0.3, the maximum value 
in each case depending upon the molecular dimensions of the templating
agent and the available void volume of the pore system of the particular
silicoaluminophosphate species involved; and "x", "y", and "z" represent the
mole fractions of silicon, aluminum and phosphorus, respectively, present as
tetrahedral oxides. The minimum value for each of "x", "y", and "z" is 0.01
and preferably 0.02. The maximum value for "x" is 0.98; for "y" is 0.60; and for
"z" is 0.52. These silicoaluminophosphates exhibit several physical and
chemical properties which are characteristic of both aluminosilicate zeolites
and aluminophosphates. Figure 1 of US-A-4440871
