<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic-based substrate for coating, e.g. with diamond, has 
a surface with basic irregularities having a surface 

roughness R
z
 of 2 to 20 µm, preferably with R
z
 at angle 
regions of 40% or more of that for other than the angle 

regions. The basic irregularities surface may have micro-sized 
irregularities on an order of crystal grains 

constituting the uppermost surface (0.5 to 10µm), forming 
dual irregularities surface structure. A coating layer 

engages with surface irregularities to secure firm adhesion 
at the cutting edge. WC-based cemented carbide is preferably 

used as a substrate and a N-containing surface layer is 
formed by heat treatment to form the surface irregularities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a ceramic-based substrate for coating
and method for producing same.With diamond-coated hard materials comprising a
substrate and diamond coated thereon, the diamond coating
layer has only a low adhesion strength with respect to the
substrate, such that the diamond coating layer tends to be
peeled off from the substrate. Various techniques, such as
exemplified hereinbelow, have hitherto been proposed in
order to improve the adhesion strength of a diamond
coating layer on a substrate.In JP Patent KOKAI Publication No. 1-246361 (JP-A-246361/89)
there is disclosed a sintered alloy having a
specified coating film formed on a heated surface of a
sintered alloy having a specified composition.In JP Patent KOKAI Publication No. 4-231428 (JP-A-231428/92),
there is disclosed a method for producing a
machining tool comprising secondary sintering of a cemented
carbide (superhard alloy) tool of a particular composition
under specified conditions followed by chemical etching and
ultrasonic grinding/polishing for forming a diamond coating
layer.In JP Patent KOKAI Nos. 4-263074 (JP-A-263074/92) and 
4-263075 (JP-A-263075/92), there is disclosed a hard
material comprising a substrate presenting specified surface
irregularities and a diamond coating layer formed thereon.Among the techniques preceding the above techniques,
there are those described in JP KOKAI Patent Publication No.
54-87719 (JP-A-87719/79) and No. 58-126972 (JP-A-126972/83)
corresponding to JP Patent KOKOKU Publication No, 62-7267.In "Powder and Powder Metallurgy", vol. 29, No. 5,
pages 159 to 163, there is report on the formation of a hard
layer on the surface of a WC-β-Co alloy, where β is a WC-TiC
solid solution. Thus it is stated therein that, if the
alloy is heated at 1673 K in N2 at 5.1 kPa (5 × 10-2
atmosphere), a hard layer presenting sharp surface
irregularities is formed; such hard layer is formed at a N2
pressure of not lower than about 0.7 kPa (about 7 × 10-3
atmosphere); and that the higher the N2 pressure and the
longer the heating time employed, the coarser become the
grains (β (N) grains) of the WC-TiC-TiN solid solution and
the more outstanding become the surface irregularities, with
formation of Co pools on the surface region. DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS, vol.2, no.11 (1993) Lausanne (CH) pages
