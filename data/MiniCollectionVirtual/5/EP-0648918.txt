<ABSTRACT>
A film cooling passage (38) through the external wall (18) of a hollow airfoil (10) having 
in serial flow relation a metering section (52) and a diffusing section (56), the diffusing 

section characterized in that it has four inward facing surfaces (66,68,70,72) that define a 
passage having a generally rectangular crosssection and an outlet (71) over which a hot 

gas stream flows in a "downstream" direction. One of the surfaces (66) of the diffusing 
section (56) is generally "downstream" of the other surfaces, and diverges from the axis of 

the passage preferably defining a section of a circular cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to film cooling, and more particularly to film
cooled walls over which a hot gas stream is flowing, such as in the case
of airfoils used in gas turbine engines.The turbine blades, or airfoils, of axial flow gas turbine engines
are directly exposed to the hot gas stream which exits the combustion
section of the gas turbine engine. As combustor temperatures are
increased to increase the performance of gas turbine engines, the
temperature of the hot gas stream may exceed the critical design
temperature limits determined by the airfoil material capability, maximum
stress, and life requirement considerations. To prevent this, the external
surface of the airfoils may be cooled by discharging cooling air from an
internal cavity of the airfoil onto the external surface thereof through a
plurality of small passages to create a film of cooling air. This film
forms a boundary layer on the external surface of the airfoil downstream
of each passage thereby providing a protective film of cool air between
the hot gas stream and the external surface of the airfoil. The angle
between the axis of the passage and the external surface of the airfoil, and
the direction of the flow of the hot gas stream over the airfoil surface at
the outlet of each passage are important factors which influence the
effectiveness of the film cooling. Since film cooling effectiveness
decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a particular cooling
passage outlet, maintaining high film cooling effectiveness for as long a
distance as possible over as large a surface area as possible is the main
goal of airfoil film cooling. It is well known in the art that the engine airfoils must be cooled
using a minimum amount of cooling air, since the cooling air is working
fluid which has been extracted from the compressor, and bleeding off
working fluid downstream of the compressor reduces overall engine
efficiency. Thus, airfoil designers face the problem of providing for
cooling of all the engine airfoils using a maximum allowable cooling fluid
flow rate. The amount of fluid which flows from the internal cavity of the
airfoil into the hot gas stream through each individual cooling passage is
controlled by the metering area - the minimum cross-sectional area - of
the cooling passage. The metering area is typically located adjacent the
intersection of the passage and the internal cavity. The combined
metering areas of all of the cooling passages and orifices leading from the
internal cavity of a given airfoil limits the total
