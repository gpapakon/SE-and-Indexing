<ABSTRACT>
A general purpose data terminal (242), such as a personal computer, portable computer, notebook computer, personal intelligent communicator, portable wireless terminal and the like employs a radio frequency (RF) modem (408) and is programed to function as a two-way acknowledge back pager. The general purpose data terminal (242) maintains a table listing (600) of caller identification information and presents this information to the device user upon receipt of a page (300) from an identifiable caller. The device user may respond to the page by selecting one of a plurality of user definable responses to be transmitted back to the caller. If no response is selected the caller will receive a message informing them of the paged party's unavailability.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VIRTUAL PAGER FOR GENERAL PURPOSE DATA TERMINALTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to radio communication systems. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for enabling a general-purpose data terminal, such as a personal computer, portable computer, personal intelligent communicator, portable wireless terminal and the like to operate as a pager.Background of the InventionCommunication systems which employ portable data terminals for providing data message communications over conventional radio frequency (RF) channels are becoming more and more common in the industry. Typically, such RF data communication systems comprise a base station with full duplex capability, a network control processor (NCP) , front end to a system host computer, and a plurality of portable radio data terminals operating in half- duplex mode.With the recent proliferation of personal computing and communications platforms which employ microcomputers, and the advent of increasingly smaller, yet reliable RF modems, it would be extremely advantageous to incorporate paging-type functionality within conventional data terminal devices such as, but not limited to portable 

computers, personal computers, personal intelligent communicators and the like. Such an incorporation will eliminate the need for multiple device platforms and will permit a single device to provide both paging and computing functionalities.Summary of the InventionBriefly described, the present invention is a method and apparatus for enabling a general-purpose data terminal, such as a personal computer, portable computer, personal intelligent communicator, portable wireless terminal and the like to function as a two- way acknowledge back pager. In this effort, the general purpose data terminal includes method steps and apparatus structure for receiving a radio paging call comprising a caller generated variable length message, said message comprising a call-back number and/or message text, said general purpose data terminal comprises a radio receiver for receiving the caller generated variable length message; memory for storing a table of caller identification information, said information comprising at least a call-back number and catchwords; a processor, coupled to the radio receiver, for extracting the call-back number from the received message; said processor, coupled to memory for indexing the memory table as a function of the extracted call-back number; a display unit, coupled to memory, for displaying the received message and the indexed

CLAIMS
1. A data communication system comprising: a base station for transmitting variable length message signals to a plurality of remotely located data terminal, said base station including: input means for receiving variable length message signals to be sent to said plurality of data terminals, and a transmitter, coupled to said input means, for transmitting the variable length messages to said plurality of data terminals, said variable length messages comprising at least one of a call¬ back number and message text; and said plurality of data terminals, each comprising: a receiver for receiving the variable length messages, means, coupled to the receiver, for selecting a variable length message as intended for a particular data terminal among the plurality, means for storing a table of caller identification information in memory, said caller identification information comprising at least one of a caller ID number and a catchword, means, coupled to the selecting means for extracting the call-back number from the selected message, means, coupled to memory and the selecting means, for comparing the received callback number to caller ID numbers stored in memory, and means for displaying the selected message and the caller identification information stored in memory as a function of the comparison. 


2. The paging system of claim 1 wherein a virtual pager is a device selected from the group consisting of: general purpose computers, personal computers, portable computers, notebook computers, electronic personal organizers and intelligent personal communicators.
■
3. The paging system of claim 1 wherein data terminal further comprises means, coupled to the selecting means for comparing the received message text to stored catchwords when a call-back number is not present, and means for displaying the selected message and the caller identification information stored in memory as a f nction of the comparison . 

4. A general purpose data terminal for receiving a radio paging call comprising a caller generated variable length message, said message comprising at least one of a call-back number and message text, said general purpose data terminal comprising: a radio receiver for receiving the caller generated variable length message; memory for storing a table of caller identification information, said information comprising at least one of a plurality of caller ID numbers and a plurality of catchwords; processing means, coupled to the radio receiver, for extracting the call-back number from the received message; said processing means, coupled to the memory, for indexing the table as a function of the extracted call-back number; a display unit, coupled to memory, for displaying the received message and the indexed caller identification information; an input device, operative by a data terminal user, for designating a user selected response in response to the message display; and a radio transmitter, responsive to the user designation, for transmitting a signal acknowledging reception of said paging call, said acknowledge signal also being indicative of a response to said paging call. 


5. The general purpose data terminal of claim 4 is a device selected from the group consisting of: personal computers, portable computers, notebook computers, electronic personal organizers, intelligent personal communicators and portable wireless terminals.
6. The general purpose data terminal of claim 4 wherein the displaying unit is a visual display device selected from the group consisting of: cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors, television monitors, liquid crystal display (LCD) modules, and light emitting diode (LED) displays.
7.

8. The general purpose data terminal of claim 4 further comprising said processing means, coupled to the radio receiver and memory, for comparing the received message text to catchwords stored in memory when a call-back number is not present and for indexing the table based upon a catchword comparison, said display unit, coupled to memory, for displaying the received message and the caller identification information stored in memory as a function of the comparison. 


9. The general purpose data terminal of claim 4 wherein the key words are selected from the group consisting of: first names, surnames, business names, addresses and names for interpersonal relationships. 

10. In a data communication system a method of radio paging comprising the steps of: transmitting a paging call comprising a caller 5 generated variable length message, said message comprising at least one of a call-back number and message text; receiving at a general purpose computer the caller generated variable length message; 10 storing within general purpose computer memory, a table of caller identification information, said caller identification information comprising at least one of call-back numbers and catchwords; extracting the call-back number from the '15 received message; indexing the table as a function of the extracted call-back number; displaying the received message and the indexed caller identification information; 20 in response to the display of said message and the caller identification information, designating a user selected response; and in response to the user designation, transmitting a signal acknowledging reception of said 25 paging call, said acknowledge signal also being indicative of a response to the transmitted paging call .
