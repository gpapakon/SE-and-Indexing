<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes a finite length 
recirculating duplex path (69) without a duplex tray and having an 

inverter (68). A receiving sheet is delayed in the inverter (68) by a 
time which is variable in order to vary the recirculating path time. 

Preferably, the time is varied according to the length of receiving sheet 
used so that maximum usage can be made of the image forming 

apparatus. 
A preferred inverter includes entrance (23) and exit (25) nips 
and a stop (3) at the end of a paper chute. The stop (3) is positioned to 

receive the leading edge of a sheet fed into the chute and hold the sheet 
through a variable time delay. The stop (3) is then moved toward the 

exit nip at the end of the time delay to begin to move the receiving 
sheet out of the inverter. The receiving position of the stop (3) is 

variable to receive sheets of different intrack length.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image forming apparatus having a 
recirculating duplex path for a receiving sheet, which duplex path 
includes an inverting mechanism. Sophisticated copiers and printers are capable of producing 
duplex output. Images are first formed on one side of one or more 
receiving sheets. The receiving sheets are fed into a duplex or 
intermediate tray from which they are returned to the image forming 
apparatus for receipt of an image on their opposite side. The duplex 
tray serves as a buffer for stacking receiving sheets. It, thus, provides 
variability in the length of the return path for the receiving sheets, 
providing some flexibility to the apparatus in the timing in which the 
sheets are presented for their second image. The duplex tray also is 
usually positioned to automatically invert the receiving sheet for 
presentation of the second side of the sheet for receipt of the second, or 
duplex, image. Despite the advantages, duplex trays are difficult to feed sheets 
out of without smearing a fresh image and are relatively expensive 
components. Some image forming apparatus, usually those using 
electronic exposure, eliminate the duplex tray and feed the receiving 
sheet directly back to the imaging component. These devices have a 
relatively invariable length return path. They eliminate many of the 
problems associated with duplex trays, but the timing of the 
presentation of the sheet for its second image is somewhat more 
limited because of the finite duplex path length. Further, without the 
duplex tray, some mechanism must be employed to invert the receiving 
sheet in the return path. Modern copiers and printers accommodate a large variety of 
sizes of receiving sheets. Many can be set to handle ten or more sizes. 
Often, three or four sizes are available to an operator by pressing a 
button on a control panel. However, a finite length duplex return path 
is designed to return a particular size sheet exactly in time to receive 
its duplex image. A slightly larger or smaller receiving sheet will not 
fit the same return path an integer number of times. Obviously, 
flexibility can be built into this system by using a substantial size  
 
interframe to absorb the varying sizes, but this approach will reduce 
the efficiency of the apparatus with all but the most common sizes. U.S. Patent No. 5,006,900, granted to Baughman et al April 9, 
1991, shows a finite return path for an electronic image forming 
apparatus. Inversion of the receiving sheet in the duplex path is 
accomplis
