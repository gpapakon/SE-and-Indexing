<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a thermal ink jet printer 
including a printhead (19) having ink firing heater
 resistors 
(17) responsive to pulses provided to the printhead. 

Warming voltage pulses are applied to the printhead to warm 
the printhead to a temperature that is at least as high as 

a temperature that would be produced pursuant to ink firing 
pulses of a predetermined voltage, a predetermined pulse 

width, and a predetermined pulse frequency. A continuous 
series of ink firing pulses are then applied to the printhead, 

starting with a pulse energy substantially equal to 
the predetermined reference pulse energy and a pulse 

frequency equal to the predetermined pulse frequency, and 
then incrementally decreasing the pulse energy of the ink 

firing pulses. The temperature of the printhead is repeatedly 
sampled while the ink firing pulses are applied to the 

ink firing resistors to produce a set of temperature 
samples respectively associated with the decreasing pulse 

energies. A thermal turn on energy is determined from the 
temperature samples, and the printhead is operated at a 

pulse energy that is greater than the thermal turn on 
energy and in a range that provides a desired print quality 

while avoiding premature failure of the heater resistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the following
pending and commonly owned European patent application EP-A-650837
ENERGY MANAGMENT SCHEME FOR AN INK JET PRINTER, inventor
John Wade, et al., filed on the same date as this application,
attorney docket number M-7468.The subject invention related generally to thermal ink
jet printers, and is directed more particularly to a
technique for determining the thermal turn on energy of a
thermal ink jet printhead while the printhead is installed
in a printer.An ink jet printer forms a printed image by printing
a pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an
array defined for the printing medium. The locations are
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear
array. The locations are sometimes called "dot
locations:, "dot positions", or "pixels". Thus, the
printing operation can be viewed as the filling of a
pattern of dot locations with dots of ink.Ink jet printers print dots by ejecting very small
drops of ink onto the print medium, and typically include
a movable carriage that supports one or more printheads
each having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses
over the surface of the print medium, and the nozzles are
controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times
pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller,
wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is
intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the
image being printed. The printheads of thermal ink jet printers are
commonly implemented as replaceable printhead cartridges
which typically include one or more ink reservoirs and an
integrated circuit printhead that includes a nozzle plate
having an array of ink ejecting nozzles, a plurality of ink
firing chambers adjacent respective nozzles, and a
plurality of heater resistors adjacent the firing chambers
opposite the ink ejecting nozzles and spaced therefrom by
the firing chambers. Each heater resistor causes an ink
drop to be fired from its associated nozzle in response to
an electrical pulse of sufficient energy.A thermal ink jet printhead requires a certain minimum
energy to fire ink drops of the proper volume (herein
called the turn on energy). Turn on energy can be
different for different printhead designs, and in fact
varies among different samples of a given printhead design
as a result of manufacturing tolerances. As a result,
thermal ink jet printers are configured to provide a fixed
ink firing energy that is greater than the expected highest
turn on energy for the printhead
