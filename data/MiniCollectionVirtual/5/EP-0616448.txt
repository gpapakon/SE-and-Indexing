<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement wherein a plurality of computers are linked together, 
one computer runs an application program. Each computer can be in an 

application mode wherein the application program may be controlled, an 
annotation mode wherein annotations made at one of the computers can be 

viewed at any of the computers, or a view mode wherein neither application 
control nor annotations are permitted, but a common display may be viewed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating a plurality of interlinked computers.Modern telephone systems allow multiple parties at different locations to hold a
conference. However, telephone conferences do not provide all of the conveniences of a
face-to-face conference, where participants all meet at a common table in a meeting room.
For example, in a meeting room, participants can view an object of interest, such as a
drawing or a product. Such viewing is not possible in a telephone conference.COMPUTERAS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, FEB 1993, USA, vol. 26, no. 1,
ISSN 0010-4809, pages 1-27, LEMKIN P F "Xconf: a network-based image conferencing
system" discloses a multimedia computer conferencing groupware tool using existing
networks which supports real-time interaction such as conversational text, images, image
pointers and group execution of programs between multiple remote computer displays.

system.
Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided A method of
operating a computer conferencing system, the system comprising a host computer and a
plurality of interlinked computers, the method comprising the steps of running an application
program on the host computer and operating each computer of the system selectively in an
application mode or an annotation mode, characterized by
   a computer in an application mode allowing participation in application program
operations, the operations comprising issuing commands to the application program;
executing the commands at the host computer providing a legal sequence of commands are
received at the host computer; capturing the graphic device interface function calls made by
the application program at the host computer in execution of the commands and notifying
these calls to the other computers of the system so as to cause the display of the host
computer to be replicated on the displays of the other computers; and 
a computer in an annotation mode allowing annotations to be made to its own display which
are replicated as a common display on the displays of the other computers of the system as

A method of operating a computer conferencing system, the system comprising a
host computer and a plurality of interlinked computers, the method comprising the steps of

running an application program on the host computer and operating each computer of the
system selectively in an application mode or an annotation mode, 
characterized by

   a computer in an application mode allowing participation in application program
operations, the operations comprising issuing commands to the application program;

executing the commands at the host computer providing a legal sequence of commands are
received at the host computer, capturing the graphic device interface function calls made by

the application program at the host computer in execution of the commands and notifying
these calls to the other computers of the system so as to cause the display of the host

computer to be replicated on the displays of the other computers; and

   a computer in an annotation mode allowing annotations to be made to its own display
which are replicated as a common display on the displays of the other computers of the

system but cannot operate said application program.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each computer can operate in a
viewing mode wherein the common display may be viewed but where participation in

application program operations and annotations of the common display are inhibited.
A method according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterized by
 the step of preventing
replication of selected areas of the display of any computer of the system at the other

computers.
A computer conference system comprising a host computer running an application
program and a plurality of interlinked computers, each computer of the system being

operable selectively in an application mode or an annotation mode, the system being adapted
to carry out the method according to any of the preceding claims.
