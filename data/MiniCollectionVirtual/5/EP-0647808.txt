<ABSTRACT>
A mixing faucet comprises valve units each including an actuating member received in a hollow casing, and 
a housing, in which the valve units are inserted and disposed, and two primary side water passages are formed to 

communicate with a hot-water supply source and a water supply source, respectively. The housing comprises an outer 
housing (1) and an inner housing (2) provided in the outer housing and formed with water passing holes (11, 12 and 

13) communicating with the valve units (16, 17). At least two primary side water passages (5, 6) are defined between 

the outer housing (1) and the inner housing (2) by a separating member (3). In addition, a hot-water passage (5) and 
a water passage (6) are defined between the outer housing (1) and the inner housing (2) by a separating member (13). 

Accordingly, the primary side water passages can be formed with ease, and the mixing faucet is simple in construction 
for ease of assembling and disassembling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hot and cold water mixing
device according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. A mixing
device of this type is known from CA-A-2 101 438. This known
device comprises an outer housing and an inner housing formed
integrally with the outer housing.The hot and cold water mixing device is formed therein
with a hot water passage and a cold water passage, though
which hot and cold water pass, respectively, a mixing
chamber therein for mixing the introduced hot and cold
water, and a mixed water passage through which the mixed
water is delivered, in order to mix, in a suitable ratio,
the hot and cold water supplied from a hot water supply
source and a cold water supply source, respectively, and to
deliver the mixed water at a desired temperature.Further, in the predetermined positions of the water
passages are built and arranged a mixing valve having an
automatic temperature regulating function to automatically
regulate the mixing ratio of the hot and cold water to a
set temperature, an opening and closing valve for
regulating the delivered amount of the mixed water, and a
change-over valve for performing a changeover of the
delivery for faucet and the delivery for shower.Recently, each of these valves has been summarized in
a unit as a function unit which is detachably fitted within
the housing of the device in order to facilitate the
assembly and maintenance of the valves.The hot and cold water mixing device, in which a valve
summarized in a unit is fitted as a valve unit within the
housing of the device, is known from, for example,
JPB-58(1983)-40060. In this example, the valve unit
(thermostat mixing valve) is detachably fitted within the
housing of the device, which is composed of a casting
material of metal such as copper alloy. Composing the housing of the device of a casting
material is preferable in that the pressure resistance of
the primary water passages such as the hot water passage,
cold water passage and the like within the housing is
increased and the appearance of the device as a product is
made more attractive. However, it has disadvantages in
that cores for the water passages must be used in casting
the device, which takes much time in the manufacturing
process and makes the price of the product higher and,
also, the device becomes heavier in weight.For this reason, a hot and cold water mixing device is
proposed in which the housing of the device is composed of
a metal pipe material and the valve units are fitted
therein (for example, U.S. Patent No.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hot and cold water mixing device which comprises one or more
valve units (16,17;42) each constituted by accommodating an operating

member within a hollow casing, and a housing into which said one or
more valve units (16,17;42) are inserted and arranged and in which two

primary water passages (5,6;36,46) communicating with a hot water
supply source and a cold water supply source, respectively, are formed,

characterized in that

said housing is composed of an outer housing (1;31) and an inner
housing (2;32), which is formed with water holes (11,12,13)

communicating with said valve units (16,17),
said inner housing (2;32) is formed independently from and is inserted
in said outer housing (1;31), and
at least two said primary water passages (5,6;36,46) are formed between
the outer housing and the inner housing by separating members (3;33).
A hot and cold water mixing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said separating members (3;33) are mounted on the outer wall surface of

the inner housing (2;32).
A hot and cold water mixing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said separating members each are composed of a seal member (4a...4d)

having elasticity.
A hot and cold water mixing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said outer housing (1;31) and said inner housing (2;32) are formed by

raw materials which are different from each other.
A hot and cold water mixing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said inner housing (2;52) is made of resin material.
A hot and cold water mixing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said outer housing (1;31) is formed by a pipe member made of metal.
