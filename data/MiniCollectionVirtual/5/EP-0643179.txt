<ABSTRACT>
A refractory heat-insulating panel used for a building 
and a structure which demand excellent fire-resisting performance. 

In a refractory heat-insulating panel (801), inorganic 
boards (831) are formed in and unitarily with male and female 

joint portions (832, 836) thereof, or light aggregate is closely 
packed in core members of the male and female joint portions, 

in such a manner that the density of the core members of the 
joint portions becomes higher than that of the core member 

of an intermediate portion of the panel, whereby the strength 
and refractory characteristics of, especially, the joint portions, 

which constitute the weak spots of the panel, are improved. 
A nonwoven cloth is inserted between a front surface member 

(802), a rear surface member (822) and a core member (829), 
or the surfaces of the front and rear surface members which 

are on the side of the core member are embossed, or a slate 
foam layer or a polyurethane foam layer is provided in the core 

member, or wood reinforcing members or tubular members are 
buried in the core member, to improve the adhesion of the 

core member, front surface member and rear surface member, 
the strenght and fire-resisting characteristics of the panel as a 

whole as well as the strength and fire-resisting characteristics 
of the joint portions thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to refractory/heat insulating panels which are
used as interior wall panels, exterior wall panels, roofing materials,
ceiling materials, floor panels, partitions, fire doors, etc. of buildings
and structures, which are required to be fire resistant, and more
particularly to refractory/heat insulating panels which are light in weight,
which have excellent fire resistance, thermal insulation and smoking
resistance, and which have enhanced mechanical strength.There are a number of known refractory panels for fire resistant structures
which include, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai)
No. 237756/1992, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication (kokai) No.
185535/1982, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication (Kokai) No.
1538/1983, Japanese Utility Model Publication (kokoku) No. 15444/1988, and
Japanese Patent Publication (kokoku) No. 18230/1990. These prior art
refractory panels have drawbacks as described below and improvement has so
far been demanded.First, the fire resistance of the joint parts of panels has turned out to be
a weak point which affects the refractory performance of the structure of
panels. In other words, deformation of a surfacing material and a backing
material of a panel caused by the difference of thermal conduction under a
high temperature makes crevices at the joint parts of panels, through which 
heat and flames spread to the opposite side. Thus, the 1-hour refractory
construction test of JIS-A-1304 (Japanese Industrial Standards A-1304)
cannot be passed.Secondly, when a core material is formed by mixing a stock solution of resol-type
phenol and a curing agent, and delivering the mixture for a foaming
reaction, scores of percent, based on the total weight of the mixture, of
condensed water generated during the reaction are held in the phenolic foams.
The captured water is vaporized during the curing period of the product or
after panels are assembled due to the change of the ambient temperature,
etc., and the residual vapor is confined between the surfacing material and
the core material of the refractory material because of no means of escape
for the vapor. Thus, the surface of the panel swells, warps, etc. and the
panel is adversely affected with passage of time.Thirdly, the adhesion between the surfacing material and the core material or
between the backing material and the core material is so weak that the
surfacing material or the backing material easily separate from the core
material by a slight impact at the
