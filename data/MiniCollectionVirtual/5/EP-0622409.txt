<ABSTRACT>
A polymer composition and a golf ball employing a 
cover formed of that composition are disclosed. The 

polymer composition comprises a blend of a lithium 
ionomer resin with one or more sodium ionomer resins. 

When two sodium ionomer resins are used, one has a lower 
flexural modulus than the other and the ball employing 

such a cover has excellent spin characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf balls and, more
particularly, to golf ball cover compositions
comprising blends of sodium ionomer resins
and a lithium ionomer resin. Golf balls made with the
cover composition of the present invention have been
found to have good shear resistance, good initial
velocity, and excellent spin rates.Generally, there are three types of golf balls in
the market, namely one-piece, two-piece and wound.
One-piece balls are molded from a homogeneous mass of
material, while two-piece balls are made by molding a
cover about a solid core. Wound balls are made by
molding a cover about a wound core. A wound core is
prepared by winding thin elastic thread about a
center.Golf ball cores, whether wound or solid,
typically measure from 1.4 to 1.6 inches (3.5 to 4.1
cm) in diameter. The cover is molded about the core
to form a golf ball having the minimum United States
Golf Association (USGA) specified diameter of 1.68
inches (4.3 cm). Typically, the cover has a thickness
of about 0.04 inches (0.1 cm).Conventionally, both two-piece and wound golf
balls are made by molding covers about cores in one of
two ways: by injection molding fluid cover stock
material around a core which is held in a retractable
pin mold; or by compression molding preformed half-shells
about the core. The preformed half-shells are
formed by injecting fluid cover stock material into 
half-shell molds and solidifying the cover stock
material into a half-shell shape.Balata was the standard cover stock material
until the middle 1960's when E.I. DuPont de Nemours
and Co. discovered a new species of resins known as
ionomer resins. These resins are sold under the
trademark SURLYNâ„¢ and, to a large extent, have
replaced balata as a cover stock material.
Chemically, these ionomer resins are a copolymer of an
olefin and an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated
carboxylic acid with 10-90% of the carboxylic acid
groups being neutralized by a metal ion. See U.S.
Patent No. 3,264,272. Today, the only commercially
available ionomer resins are copolymers of ethylene
and methacrylic or acrylic acid. These ionomer resins
are distinguished by the type of metal ion, the amount
of acid, and the degree of neutralization.Dunlop Rubber Company obtained the first patent
on the use of Surlyn for the cover of a golf ball, see
U.S. Patent No. 3,454,280 issued July 8, 1969. Since
then, there have been a number of disclosures on the
use of these ionomer resins in the cover composition
of a golf ball. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
