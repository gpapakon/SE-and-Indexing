<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for pumping a liquid from a 
reservoir, by immersing one end of a tube in a reservoir of 

the liquid to be pumped, which end includes a one-way valve 
permitting the liquid to flow into the tube from the 

reservoir but not vice versa, and cyclically reciprocating 
by an electrical drive the immersed end of the tube parallel 

to the axis of the immersed end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
pumping a liquid, and also a pump operating in accordance 
with such method. The invention is particularly useful as 
an inexpensive, low flow-rate pump for pumping water from a 
lower elevation to a higher elevation, for use, e.g., in 
watering house plants, and the invention is therefore 
described below with respect to this application. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel liquid pumping method, and also a novel pump which 
requires but a few simple parts that can be constructed in 
volume and at low cost, and which therefore makes the pump 
particularly suitable for use in watering house plants and 
the like. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method of pumping a liquid, comprising: 
immersing one end of a tube in a reservoir of the liquid to 
be pumped, which end includes a one-way valve permitting the 
liquid to flow into the tube from the reservoir but not vice 
versa; and cyclically reciprocating by an electrical drive 
the immersed end of the tube parallel to the axis of the 
immersed end. According to another aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a pump for pumping a liquid from a 
reservoir, comprising: a tube having one end immersible in 
the liquid in the reservoir; a one-way valve carried by the 
immersible end of the tube permitting the liquid to flow 
into the tube from the reservoir but not vice versa, and an 
electric drive for cyclically reciprocating the immersible 
end of the tube parallel to its longitudinal axis. A pump constructed in accordance with the 
foregoing features can be produced in volume and at low 
cost, thereby making the pump particularly useful as an 
inexpensive, low flow-rate pump for pumping water to 
household plants and the like.  Figs. 1-7 schematically illustrate seven 
constructions of a pump in accordance with the present 
invention; and Fig. 8 illustrates one application of the pump 
for use in watering house plants and the like. The pump illustrated in Fig. 1 comprises a 
reservoir 2 containing a supply of water 4 to be pumped via 
a flexible tube 6 to a higher elevation, e.g., for use in 
watering house plants and the like. For this purpose, the 
pump includes a rigid tube 8 connected to the flexible tube 
6 and constituting its lower end. The lower end of tube 8 
carries a one-way valve 10 which is immersed in the water 4 
in reservoir 2. Valve 10 is schematically illustrated in 
Fig. 1 as including a valve member 12 normally urged by a 
spring
