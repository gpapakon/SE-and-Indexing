<ABSTRACT>
A trough assembly for the delivery of gob to mould 
cavities in a glassware forming machine comprises an 

upwardly facing trough and a downwardly facing deflector 
which are supported in the machine by a hanger. The hanger 

comprises a supporting member which can be fixed in the 
frame of the machine, a first flexible hanger member 

extending axially in a bore of the supporting member and a 
second rigid hanger member fixed to the first flexible 

member. The trough and the deflector are supported by the 
second hanger member and small adjustments of their position 

may be obtained by flexing of the flexible member and 
movement of the rigid member in the bore of the supporting 

member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in means
for delivering gobs of glass to the moulds of glassware
forming machines.In the well known I.S. type of glassware forming
machines, a number [generally from 8 to 16] of individual
sections of the same construction are mounted side by side,
and are arranged to operate out of phase with each other so
that a substantially continuous flow of formed glassware is
produced. Each section normally contains parison forming
moulds and blow moulds, and may be constructed to receive
1,2,3 or 4 gobs of molten glass at a time into the
corresponding number of parison moulds, in which the gobs
are formed into parisons, which parisons are then
transferred to the blow moulds and formed into the desired
shape.The gobs are supplied to the parison moulds through
trough assemblies to which gobs are provided by a gob
distributor. There is a trough assembly associated with
each section, and the gob distributor is arranged to provide
the required number of gobs to each trough assembly in turn
through a number of scoops which are moved into alignment
with upper end portions of the trough assembly.Each trough assembly comprises, associated with each
mould cavity of the section, an upwardly facing inclined
trough, which carries a gob from the scoop into a position
above and to one side of the parison mould, and a downwardly
facing deflector which deflects a gob travelling down the
trough into a vertical path to fall into the cavity of the
parison mould.It can be seen that, for each gob, a pathway is
provided by the scoop, the upwardly facing trough and the
downwardly facing deflector. It is essential to ensure that 
a gob arrives at the parison mould in its desired condition
that this pathway is smooth, and does not comprise any
changes of direction in a vertical plane. Consequently it
is necessary to ensure that the three components are
accurately aligned, in particular that, viewed in plan,
there is no 'dog leg' formed.The alignment and orientation of the scoop is
determined by the gob distributor.The trough has an upper end portion which comprises two
downwardly facing slotted lugs, which are fitted over a
supporting rod which extends arcuately across the machine,
and is located transversely on the rod by a locating block
fixed to the rod and lying between the slotted lugs. A
small amount of play length wise of the rod may occur, and
the trough is free to move angularly about the rod.A lower end portion of the trough is supported by a
complex bracket which is supported by a

<CLAIMS>
A trough assembly for a glassware forming machine to
enable a gob of molten glass from a gob distributor to be

delivered to a parison mould cavity of the machine the
assembly comprising


an upwardly facing inclined trough (10) to receive a
gob from the gob distributor
a downwardly facing deflector (12) defining a vertical
axis, the deflector (12) deflecting a gob which has

travelled down the trough (10) into a vertical path along
the vertical axis, which axis may be aligned with a parison

mould cavity
a hanger (20) which is adapted to be supported in a
frame member of the machine and which supports the trough

(10) and the deflector (12)

characterised in that the hanger (20) comprises
a supporting member (32) which can be secured in the
frame member of the machine and comprising a vertical

cylindrical bore (36) having a vertical axis
a first, flexible, hanger member (38) extending axially
in the bore of the supporting member (32) and having an

upper end portion (40) fixed to the supporting member (32)
a second, rigid, hanger member (50) fixed to a lower
end portion of the first hanger member (38) and comprising a

cylindrical upper end portion (48) which is positioned in
the bore of the supporting member (32), and a lower end

portion which supports the deflector (12) and the trough
(10)
and the arrangement being such that the vertical axis
of the supporting member (32) and the vertical axis of the

deflector (12) are normally in alignment, but the deflector
(12) may be adjusted in position by pivotal movement of the

rigid hanger member, the flexible hanger member flexing to 
allow such movement and clearance between the bore of the

supporting member (32) and the upper end portion of the
rigid hanger member (50) restricting its extent.
A trough assembly according to claim 1 wherein the
first hanger member (38) and the second hanger (50) member

are integral.
A trough assembly according to one of claims 1 and 2
wherein the first, flexible, hanger member (38) comprises a

flexible tubular portion.
A trough assembly according to claim 3 comprising a pin
secured in the second hanger member and extending through

opposed holes in the supporting member thus to prevent any
torsional movement of the second hanger member.
A trough assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims in which an upper end portion of the second hanger

member is spherically rounded.
A trough assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein the second hanger member comprises a

cylindrical collar which is positioned in the bore of the
supporting member.
