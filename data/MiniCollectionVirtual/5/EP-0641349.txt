<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to platinum(II) 
complexes of formula (1) 
(am)2Pt O-CO-C6H4-NH2(p), (Cl)n (HCl)n1 (ROH)m 
wherein: 
am is a monovalent amine ligand, selected from NH3, 
linear or branched C1-5 alkylamine, cyclopentylamine, 
cyclopropylamine or cyclohexylamine; or the two am 
groups form a linear or cyclic C2-8-alkyl-1,2 or 1,3-diamine 
; R is hydrogen or C1-3 alkyl; n1, n and m are independently zero or the integer 1. A linear or branched C1-5 alkylamine is preferably 
isopropylamine, propylamine or n-pentylamine; the 
linear or branched C1-3 dialkylamine is preferably 
diisopropylamine. Examples of linear C2-8-alkyl-1,2- or 1,3-diamine 
include 1,2-ethylenediamine, (R, S, racemic or meso)butane-1,2-diamine, 
1,3-propylenediamine; examples of 
cyclic diamine comprise R, S, racemic or meso cyclopentane-1,2-diamine; 
R, S, (racemic or meso) cyclohexane-1,2-diamine; 
1,1-bis-aminomethyl-cyclopentane; 1,1-bis-aminomethylcyclohexane. When m is 1, the compounds (1) are solvates with 
water or alcohols. When n is 1, the compounds (1) are addition salts. 
Particularly preferred compounds are:  
 
cis-diamino-chloro-(4-amino)benzoate-platinum(II), cis-diamino-chloro-(4-amino)benzoate-platinum(II) 
hydrochloride, (1A) aquo-cis-diamino-chloro-(4-amino)benzoate-platinum(II), 
(1B) cis-diamino-chloro-(4-amino)benzoate-platinum(II) mono 
methanol solvate, (1C). JP 63-303987 discloses platinum complexes 
having 3-hydroxy-benzoate ligand and a hydroxy ligand 
and differ therefore from that of formula I, 
characterized by a 4-amino-benzoate ligand and by a 
chloro ligand instead of the hydroxy ligand. The compounds of formula (1) are prepared by a 
process comprising: 
a) the reaction of a dichloro platinum(II) complexes 
of formula (2) 
 
wherein am is AS defined above, with at least one molar 
equivalent of p-aminobenzoic acid in the form of free 
acid or of carboxylate salt with a mono or bivalent 
metal, preferably alkali, alkaline-earth metal or 
silver, in a suitable hydroxylated solvent; b) the subsequent purification of a compound of 
formula (1). Preferred solvents are water, C1-3 alcohols or 
mixtures thereof. Water solutions or suspensions of 
reagents are particularly preferred. It is particularly preferred the use of lithium p-aminobenzoate 
which is more easily handled and less 
toxic than the silver or barium salts. The reaction may be carried out by mixing water 
solutions of the reagents. or adding a dichloro-platinum(II) 
of formula (2) as finely subdivided solid 
to a water solution of
