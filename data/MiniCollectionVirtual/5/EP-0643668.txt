<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus are disclosed in which cyanuric acid is utilized to remove nitrogen oxides (or ''NOx'') from exhaust gases or the like. In one embodiemnt, particles of cyanuric acid (14) are contacted with the exhaust gas under conditions in which the cyanuric acid decomposes and the NOx is reduced. A venturi (24) is utilized to controllably convey the particles of cyanuric acid into the exhaust gas (38). Supplemental fuel such as diesel or other fuels may be added to control reaction conditions such as temperature. In other embodiments, a liquid cyanuric acid slurry is formed, with the liquid comprising diesel fuel, water or other suitable liquid. The liquid cyanuric acid slurry may be heated and/or catalyzed prior to contact with the exhaust gas. In certain embodiments, the liquid-cyanuric acid slurry is heated and/or catalyzed in a manner so as to produce decomposition products including reactive species such as free radicals, which are subsequently contacted with the exhaust gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR REMOVING NOχ FROM EXHAUST GASES USING CYANURIC ACIDField of InventionThe present invention relates to the removal of nitrogen oxides or "NO^." from exhaust gases and the like, and more particularly to a process and apparatus utilizing particles of cyanuric acid or a liquid-cyanuric acid slurry.Background of the Invention Recent emphasis on ecological concerns in the environment has spawned many efforts to solve the world's air pollution problems. Two major concerns are acid rain and photochemical smog. While many compounds contribute to these problems, N0χ plays an important role, imposing a significant threat to the environment and human health.,,N0χ" is a family of compounds of nitrogen and oxygen, primarily NO and N02. NOχ comes from a variety of sources, most notably cars, trucks and industrial plants. Specifically, NOχ is produced by high temperature combustion systems, metal cleaning processes, and the production of fertilizers, explosives, nitric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. In many urban environments, automobiles and diesel engine trucks are the major sources of N0χ. NO is the stable oxide of nitrogen at combustion temperatures. Hence, it is more abundantly produced than N02. However, at ambient conditions, the equilibrium between NO and N02 favors N02. Therefore, the effective control of N0χ concerns both the control and removal of both NO and N02 from exhaust gas streams from sources such as those mentioned above.Many attempts have been made to control the generation or release of N0χ. Many known strategies 

 involve the control of combustion conditions. This can be accomplished by reducing the temperature and amount of oxygen present during the combustion process. Another strategy is a reburning process. In this process, NOχ compounds are incinerated in a secondary combustion zone, using particular fuels which do not contain nitrogen. Another strategy is removal of N0χ from the post-combustion gas or exhaust stream.Several ways to remove NOχ downstream from the combustion process are known. One such strategy is a scrubbing technique which takes advantage of the fact that N02 combines with water to form nitric acid. Nitric acid reacts with ammonia to yield the stable product ammonium nitrate. However, known scrubbing techniques do not remove NO. To overcome this obstacle, those skilled in the art have sought to oxidize NO to N02 and then apply the aqueous scrubbing process to remove the N02. NO can be oxidized to N02 using various organic compounds, such as
