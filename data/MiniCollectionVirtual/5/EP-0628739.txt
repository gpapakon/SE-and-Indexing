<CLAIMS>
Arrangement comprising a supporting frame (2), rollers (3, 4) which are fastened by 
means of a pin (12) in a bore hole (14) in the supporting frame (2), and a guide rail 

(5), whereby, in order to position the rollers against the guide rail, at least one roller 
(3) is rendered flexible in the radial direction by means of spring elastic elements 

(17, 18) before the pin is fastened, characterised in that one or more spring elastic 
elements (17, 18) are arranged between the pin (12) inserted through the bore hole 

(14) in the supporting frame (2) and the wall of the bore hole. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the axle (9) of the roller (3, 
4) is formed in one piece with the pin (12) and that the inner raceway has rolling 

elements (10, 11) positioned between the axle (9) and roller casing (8). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that a collar (13) is positioned 
between the axle (9) and pin (12) such that the side of the collar facing the pin (12) 

provides the contact surface with the supporting frame (2). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that the axle has a larger 
diameter than that of the pin at least at the end which faces the supporting frame. 
Arrangement according to one of the above Claims, characterised in that a shim is 
positioned between the roller (3, 4) and the supporting frame (2).  

 
Arrangement according to one of the above Claims, characterised in that the pin 
(12) is equipped with at least one ring groove (15, 16) for supporting a toroidal ring 

(17, 18) made of elastomer or similar material which serves as an elastic element.
