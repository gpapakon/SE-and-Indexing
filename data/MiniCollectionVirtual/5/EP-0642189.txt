<ABSTRACT>
The antenna includes a microstrip circuit board carrying a conducting strip, along one edge (23), this strip constituting a linear conductor (3) configured so as to be linked to a radio circuit (13) of the apparatus. The antenna may thus be arranged in operating position within the apparatus. The invention is well suited to radiotelephony terminals.

<CLAIMS>
Antenna for a portable radio apparatus, said antenna comprising a linear
conductor (3) arranged to be connected to a radio circuit (13), 
characterised by

the fact that said antenna includes a microstrip circuit board carrying a
conducting strip, constituting at least partially said conductor (3), which

extends over a first face (21) of the board and along a first (23) of its edges
opposite a second (25) of its edges, carrying a ground plane and adjacent to

said first face (21), and another conductor (6) extends over a second face (22)
of the board, parallel to said first face (21) of said conductor (3), to be excited

and to excite said conductor (3) by capacitive effect.
Antenna according to claim 1, wherein a conducting link (4, 4T) connects the
conductor (3) to said second edge (25) of the board.
Antenna according to claim 2, wherein connecting means (9) are provided to
connect to the radio circuit (13) the end of the conducting link (4) situated on

said second edge (25).
Antenna according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said conductor (3)
continues (4) along a third (26) edge of the board.
Antenna according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a conducting layer (12) is
provided to constitute a reflector plane extending, from a foot (9) of the

antenna, over a distance substantially equal to quarter of the operating
wavelength of the antenna.
