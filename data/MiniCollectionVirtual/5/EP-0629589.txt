A method of making slab construction and decorative 
materials which resemble natural stone and have a high strength, 

for cladding façades, walls and floors indoors and outdoors, 
comprising stratified individual layers of broken glass, 

aggregates and mixtures thereof, having the following process 
steps: 


1.1 introduction of a planar layer of sand of uniform thickness 
into one or more heat-resistant moulds, 
1.2 covering over with a further planar layer of uniform 
thickness comprising a the mixture of glass and sand, and 
1.3 pouring on a further planar layer of broken glass, 
1.4 each individual layer being compacted separately and the 
entire stack of layers being compacted, 
1.5 subsequently, heating the stack of layers in the mould from 
room temperature to a temperature of 600 - 850°C, dependent 

on the chemical composition of the mixture, during a period 
from 20 to 100 min., 
1.6 thoroughly heating the stack at this temperature for a 
period of 6 to 35 min., 
1.7 subsequently, further increasing the temperature to a range 
in which the surface of the glass has a viscosity η of 10

to 10

 dPas, and maintaining this temperature for 6 to 40 
min.,
 
the action of heat during the process steps up until this 

being from one side, from above, by a heat stream which is  
 

distributed uniformly over the entire slab surface, 
1.8 then cooling to temperatures of 750 - 600°C during a period 
required to achieve uniform temperature distribution over 

the entire thickness of the stack, for 6 to 35 min., 
1.9 continuing to maintain this temperature for 15 to 65 min., 
and then cooling further in a precisely linear manner to 

temperatures of 400 - 500°C at a rate of 2 to 5 K/min, and 
on reaching these temperatures then cooling freely or in 

enforced manner to room temperature. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that there 
are used as the broken glass glass granules having a composition

and having a grain size of 0.2 to 5 mm, in particular 2 to 3 mm, 

and a moisture content of ≥ 5% of water. 
A method according to Claim 2, characterized in that there  
 

are used as the glass glass granules of flat glass and/or hollow 

glass. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that there 
is used as the aggregate sand of grain sizes below 1 mm and 

having a moisture content of at least 7% of water. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
mixtures of glass and sand comprising 3 to 6 parts by weight of 

glass to 1 part by weight of sand, in particular 4 parts by 
weight of glass to 1 part by weight of sand, are made. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the stratified individual layers are introduced in stratum 

thicknesses of: 

0 - 3 mm, in particular 1.5 - 2 mm for the layer of sand (1.1) 
2 - 30 mm, in particular 12 - 15 mm for the mixtures (1.2) 
2 - 7 mm, in particular 3 - 5 mm for the layer of glass (1.3). 
A method according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
a metal reinforcement, in particular in the form of a grating or 

wire mesh, is introduced into the layer mixed from glass and sand 
1.2. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
mica and/or coloured pigments and/or metal oxides are mixed into 

the upper layer of broken glass in proportions of 0.05 - 3%.

layer 1.3, the temperature corresponding to this viscosity is 

maintained for 5 - 15 min., in particular 10 min., and then 
cooling is carried out rapidly, in particular by means of 

compressed air, to 350 / 300°C.
