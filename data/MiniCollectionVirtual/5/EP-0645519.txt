A drilling device, comprising a telescopable Kellybar (16) including an outer 
tube (17) and at least one telescope tube (18) guided and lockable therein, a tool 

(22) being mountable to the front end of the innermost telescope tube (18), and 
comprising a drilling mast (10) on which a carriage (14) is displaceable, which 

comprises a drive head (15) for rotating the outer tube (17) of the Kellybar (16), 
wherein a rotating head (30) is provided in the Kellybar (16), which comprises 

a stator (31) connected to at least one pressure line (33) and a rotor (32) connected 
to the front end of the innermost telescope tube (18), and a rotation 

protecting means (36) projecting into the outer tube (17) extends to the stator 
(31) and protects it against co-rotation with the Kellybar (16). 
The drilling device according to claim 1, comprising a traction element (40) 
engaging at the rotating head (30) for pulling up the innermost telescope tube 

(18) of the Kellybar (16). 
The drilling device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the rotation protecting 
means (36) consists of a tube passing through the drive head (15) and being 

held so as to be secured against rotation above the drive head. 
The drilling device according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the pressure line 
(33) is a flexible hose line which is led over a roll (34) supported on the drilling 

mast (10) and is resiliently biased in its longitudinal direction. 
The drilling device according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the rotor (32) of 
the rotating head (30) is connected to at least one channel (26) extending 

through the innermost telescope tube (18) to the lower end thereof.  
 
The drilling device according to claim 5, wherein the channel (26) extends in a 
tube (25) being connected, at the lower end of the innermost telescope tube 

(18), to a bottom plate (19) closing this telescope tube. 
The drilling device according to claim 6, wherein the bottom plate (19) comprises 
a projecting transition piece (20) for mounting a tool (22), the transition 

piece (20) having at least one bore to supply pressure medium to the tool (22). 
The drilling device according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the rotation 
protecting means (36) is a telescopable tubing. 
The drilling device according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the rotation 
protecting means (36) is a rigid tube, and the stator (31) of the rotating head 

(30) slides along the rotation protecting means. 
A Kellybar for use in a drilling device according to one of the preceding claims, 
comprising an outer tube (17) and at least one telescope tube (18) guided and 

lockable therein, said innermost telescope tube (18) surrounding a channel (26) 
to the upper end of which the rotor is mountable.
