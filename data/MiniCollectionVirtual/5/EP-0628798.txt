<ABSTRACT>
In a procedure for eliminating non-relevant measured values for an imbalance measured signal consisting of a multiplicity of individual measured values, and a circuit arrangement for determining the imbalance afflicting a rotating body (10) in at least one measuring plane, having at least one oscillation converter (5, 8) and an angular position transmitter (19) for processing the imbalance measured signal (6, 9), an indication device for indicating the imbalance according to position and magnitudes (24, 25, 29) and/or a processing device (26) for the further processing of the imbalance, for the purposes of taking into account, by means of a logic unit (12) operating with fuzzy knowledge, unexpected disturbances during the formation of the imbalance measured value, it is proposed, by means of a logic unit (12) operating with fuzzy knowledge detecting the approximate expected course of the imbalance measured signal, in the event of individual measured values deviating strongly, to eliminate these as non-relevant.

A process for the elimination of non-relevant measured 
values for an imbalance measurement signal comprising a 

plurality of individual measured values, characterised in 
that in the event of greatly deviating individual measured 

values a fuzzy logic unit (12), which recognises the 
possible, expected characteristic of the imbalance 

measurement signal, eliminates said greatly deviating 
individual measured values as non-relevant. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the fuzzy logic unit (12) allows a fuzzy band width of 

measured values corresponding to the possible characteristic 
of the imbalance measurement signal. 
A process according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterised 
in that after the start of the measurement, during a 

substantially expected, constant amplitude characteristic of 
the consecutive measured values and in dependence upon the 

individual amplitude values, the fuzzy logic unit (12) 
carries out a fuzziness selection process which determines 

whether the individual amplitude measured value is allowed 
to form the imbalance measurement signal. 
A process according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the measured value is also modified in dependence upon the 

fuzzy logic unit (12). 
A circuit arrangement for determining the imbalance of 
a rotatable body (10) in at least one measurement plane, 

comprising at least one vibration transducer (5, 8) and an 
angular position sensor (19) for the processing of the 

imbalance measurement signal, a display device for 
displaying the imbalance in terms of position and magnitude 

(24, 25) and/or a processing device (26) for the further  
 

processing of the imbalance, for the implementation of the 
process according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that the imbalance measurement signals (6, 
9) emitted from the vibration transducer (5, 8) are directly 

processed by the fuzzy logic unit (12). 
A circuit arrangement for determining the imbalance of 
a rotatable body (10) in at least one measurement plane, 

comprising at least one vibration transducer (5, 8) and an 
angular position sensor (19) for the processing of the 

imbalance measurement signal, a display device for 
displaying the imbalance in terms of position and magnitude 

(24, 25, 29) and/or a processing device (26) for the further 
processing of the imbalance, for the implementation of the 

process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that at least one matching amplifier (14) for the imbalance 

measurement signal (6, 9) is present between the output of 
the vibration transducer and the input of the fuzzy logic 

unit (12). 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that a further preliminary filtering device 

(17) is provided downstream of the at least one matching 
amplifier (14), and that the output of this device (17), 

which emits the imbalance measurement signal (6, 9), is 
connected to the fuzzy logic unit (12) for the processing of 

this imbalance measurement signal. 
A circuit arrangement for determining the imbalance of 
a rotatable body (10) in at least one measurement plane, 

comprising at least one vibration sensor (5, 8) and an 
angular position sensor (19) for the processing of the 

imbalance measurement signal (6, 9), a display device for 
displaying the imbalance in terms of position and magnitude 

(24, 25, 29), and/or a processing device (26) for the 
further processing of the imbalance, for the implementation  

 
of the process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that on the one hand the information output 
from the vibration transducer (5, 8) is fed across a fuzzy 

logic unit (12) and then is forwarded to a measured value 
processing device (23) and on the other hand the information 

from the vibration transducer (5, 8) is fed via a matching 
amplifier (14) and/or a preliminary filter (17) to the 

measured value processing device (23), and that the measured 
value processing (23) takes place in dependence upon the 

fuzzy logic values. 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that a storage arrangement (27, 28, 31) is 

in each case provided between the fuzzy logic values, the 
values from the matching amplifier (14) and the preliminary 

filter (17), the values from the angular position sensor 
(19) and the measured value processing device (23).
