<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for measuring a
temperature of a high temperature liquid using an optical fiber and
a method therefor and in particular to the apparatus and the method
which allow a continuous measurement.A prior art method for measuring a temperature of molten metal
in a furnace such as a converter processing a decarburization of
molten iron, one of the steel smelting furnaces, adopts a sublance
method or a manually operating thermocouple measurement method. In
the sublance method, a thermometer element attached at a tip of a
movable lance is inserted through a raw material charge hole on the
furnace or other hole to perform the temperature measurement.
Accordingly, the sublance method has disadvantages given below.Firstly, a size of apparatus for measuring a temperature is
enlarged in proportion to a size of the furnace. Secondly,
replacement of a thermometer element is forcedly required in every
measuring cycle because the thermometer element is of one time
disposable type, and further the replacement of the thermometer 
element is also required. Thirdly, intermittent measurement of the
temperature forcedly carried out during operation because the
consumption type thermocouple is forcedly replaced in every
measurement cycle. And furthermore, frequent measurement is not
allowed in view of an economic reason because of the disposition of
such a thermometer element every measurement cycle. As the result,
an actual observed temperature at the end of the process does not
always agree with a target temperature, which often causes problems
of generation of energy loss, increase of production cost, and
degradation of productivity.As a known technology of measuring a temperature in a furnace
continuously, JP-A-91529/1986 (the term "JP-A-" referred to
hereinafter signifies "Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication")
discloses a method for measuring a temperature in a furnace using
an optical fiber. In the disclosed method, however, the optical
fiber is fixed at the tip of a nozzle so that the temperature
measurement is carried out through a gas layer which is ejected from
the tip of the nozzle. For this reason, this measuring method
raises a serious problem on accuracy of the measured result. In
addition, the tip of the optical fiber is exposed to an elevated
temperature for a long period, which raises a problem of change of
characteristics with passing time.JP-A-203716/1988 discloses another method of continuous
measurement of a molten steel. The method relates to a control
method
