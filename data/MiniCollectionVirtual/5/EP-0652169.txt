<ABSTRACT>
Chain link made of plastic having at least one hinge eye 
(2, 2') with a transverse shaft bore (3) and adapted to be 

interconnected in a number to form a conveyor chain or a 
conveyor belt in that adjacent links are interconnected in 

a hinge-like manner by a shaft or a pivot and where the 
chain link comprises a locking device (4) formed integrally 

with the hinge eye (2') of the chain link for positionally 
securing the lateral movement of the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to a chain link for conveyor
chains or conveyor belts of the kind described in the
introduction to claim 1.Applicant's own Danish patent no. 159544 (= US-A-5 000 312)
describes injection moulded plastic hinge chain links and
where the lateral movement of a shaft or a pivot may be
limited by inserting a locking dowel into an undercut
groove in the outer edge of the chain link.A corresponding technique is known from US-A-4 832 187
where a split and thus resilient locking device is used, or
from US-A-3 726 569 where a resilient plug or a cross-bolt
is used.These structures are all disadvantageous in that additional
parts are required for preventing the lateral movement of a
shaft or a pivot and these parts will often have to be
manufactured with comparatively small tolerances in order
to remain fixed in the chain link. These structures therefore
become complicated and costly, and it is moreover
known that chain link conveyors based on these principles
may be exposed to operational stops if merely a single
locking device or locking plug is missing in a single chain
link. Furthermore, the known structures suffer from various
mechanical weaknesses which may result in reduced strength
in the chain links. Moreover, the known structures complicate
the assembly of the individual chain links for a conveyor
chain or conveyor belt and the assembly may be difficult
or impossible to automate. Prior art document EP-A-0 
567 337, forming the preamble of claim 1, shows a link of
this type.Additionally, there is known a structure made by the firm
Intralox, USA, where the outermost finger in the outermost
chain links is designed with an integral, resilient device
mounted externally on the outwardly facing side of the
chain link. This eliminates some of the problems with loose
locking devices but instead many other weaknesses by such a
structure will be met with. The resilient device is mounted
at the outer end of the chain link and may therefore easily
break off when getting into contact with other machine
parts, for example the side edge of the track, and damaged
chain links must therefore be replaced at once. This
structure moreover requires several different types of
chain links if they are to be assembled side by side for
forming a conveyor belt, which results in increased production
costs, storage expenses etc. Finally, it is probable
that chain link conveyors or chain link belts of this nature
may have reduced wearability in the edge areas. Prior
art document EP-A-0 484 883 shows a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Chain link (1) made of plastic comprising a number of
fingers (2, 2'), each having a transverse shaft bore (3)

for accommodating a pivot shaft (20), the links being
adapted to be interconnected in a number to form a conveyor

chain or belt, such that adjacent chain links can be
interconnected in a hinge-like manner by means of the pivot

shaft (20), whereby at least one finger (2') comprises a
locking device (4) for selectively securing the shaft in a

lateral direction, the locking device being housed within
the finger and being accessible through an aperture (7) in

the finger (2'), the aperture (7) being positioned at a
certain distance from an outer edge (5) of the finger and

being in contact with the shaft bore (3), in which the chain
link (1) comprises a further projection (19), formed integrally

with the chain link (1), for engagement with a projection
(15) of the locking device 
characterised in

that the locking device (4) forms an integral part (11) of
the chain link (1) and comprises said projection (15) linked

by means of a flexible part (10) to the chain link (1)
thereby enabling the locking device (4) to bend, and in that,

the locking device (4) can be placed in two
stable positions on either side of the further projection

(19). 
Chain link according to claim 1, 
characterised in
 that
the projection (15) of the locking device and the further

projection (17) is connected via a materialwise thin or
film-like section (18), which is adapted to be broken.
Chain link according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterised
in
 that the finger (2') further comprises a pin or a bridge
part (12) formed integrally with the chain link and adapted 

to limit the movement of the locking device (4) further.
Chain link according to any one of claims 1-3, 
characterised
in
 that the outermost finger (2') of the chain link
at either side of the chain link (1) is provided with a

locking device (4).
