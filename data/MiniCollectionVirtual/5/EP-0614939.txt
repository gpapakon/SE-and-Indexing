<ABSTRACT>
A polypropylene resin composition resistant to high 
energy radiation is disclosed. 
The polypropylene resin composition comprising a mixture 
consisting essentially of from approximately 95 to 

approximately 99.6 % by weight of a polypropylene, from 
approximately 0.01 to approximately 1.0 % by weight of a 

phosphorous antioxidant, from approximately 0.01 to 
approximately 2.0 % by weight of a phenolic antioxidant and 

from approximately 0.01 to approximately 2.0 % by weight of an 
amine light stabilizer.

composition according to the present invention is irradiated 

with a gamma ray provided by a cobalt 60 source, it is 
preventive of embrittlement, discoloration and decrease of 

tensile elongation and keeps high clarity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a
polypropylene resin composition resistant to high energy
radiation and, more particularly, to a resin composition
containing isotactic polypropylene inhibiting the degradation
caused by irradiation.Polypropylene is an exemplary stereoregular polymer, and
its properties are affected by molecular weight, distribution
of molecular weight, stereoregularity and the like.
Stereoregular polymers are grouped into atactic polymers,
syndiotactic polymers and isotactic polymers. Among these
stereoregular polymers, only isotactic polymers are
commercially available.In an isotactic polypropylene, all methyl groups are
arranged in either above or below side of the plane including
a main chain, so that it has a high melting point and superior
mechanical properties including thermal resistance.
Accordingly, commercially available polypropylenes are all 
subjected to this type. However, in general, the isotactic
polypropylene partially includes atactic polymers therein and
thus, since the isotactic polymer has a great influence on the
physical properties, the ratio of isotactic polymer is very
important in polypropylene. As the ratio of isotactic polymer
is higher, the crystallinity and hardness of polypropylene are
enhanced with the melting point high. The commercially
manufactured polypropylene has isotactic indexes ranging from
90 to 99 %.Dr. Ziegler succeeded in commercially manufacturing
polypropylene in 1953, using a Ziegler catalyst (Al(C2H4)3 +
TiCl4) developed by himself. However, the polypropylene of
Ziegler, which has a rubber phase without stereoregularity, is
an atactic polymer with little commercial value.In 1955, Dr. Natta developed a Ziegler-Natta catalyst
(Al(C2H4)3 + TiCl3), which is more improved than the Ziegler
catalyst and established a slurry polymerization process for
polypropylene in the first time in the world. Using the
Ziegler-Natta catalyst, he produced isotactic polypropylenes
superior in crystallinity, thermal resistance and mechanical
properties and obtained a commercial success. Thenceforth,
world-prominent chemical companies, such as Hercules of
U.S.A., ICI of Britain, Mitsui Toatsu of Japan and the like
employ the process of slurry polymerization. Since then, a
number of companies have developed catalysts for the 
preparation of polypropylene, so that a slurry polymerization
process, a solventless slurry process and a gas polymerization
process ware established.The polypropylenes prepared by such processes have
been applied to many uses
