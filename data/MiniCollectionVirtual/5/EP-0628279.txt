<ABSTRACT>
A device provides a sanitary cover (4) for a toilet seat (2) when a 
toilet seat 

cover (3) makes contact with a toilet seat as happens when the toilet 
seat cover 

is closed. The device includes a toilet seat cover (3) which holds a 
plurality of 

toilet seat sanitary covers (4), and means (6) for clamping a sanitary 
cover. The 

means for clamping are disposed at an end of the toilet seat and clamps a 
portion of a toilet seat sanitary cover when the toilet seat cover and the 

toilet seat make contact. The act of closing the toilet seat cover clamps a 
toilet seat sanitary cover kept inside the toilet seat cover and 

positions it on the toilet seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for providing at least
one of a plurality of sanitary covers for a toilet seat according
to the preamble of claim 1 and a system consisting of that
device and a sanitary cover.More specifically, this invention relates to a device which provides a sanitary
cover for a toilet seat when a toilet seat cover contacts a toilet seat as
it happens during the closing of the toilet seat cover.Conventionally, in order to prevent users from feeling unsanitary,
unclean, and the like, disposable types of toilet seat sanitary covers are
provided in public rest rooms. Generally, in this case, people put a toilet
seat sanitary cover on a toilet seat by themselves. However, sometimes
people cannot easily put a toilet seat sanitary cover on the toilet seat
properly, and sometimes the toilet seat sanitary cover does not stay in
position when people sit on it.Recently, an automatic toilet seat sanitary cover providing device
was disclosed in JP-A-63-294817. This
device has a roller-shaped toilet seat sanitary cover kept in the back of
toilet seat body. The roller-shaped toilet seat sanitary cover is pulled out
to a desired length by means of a motor and the like. Another automatic
toilet seat sanitary cover providing device has a bag-shaped film sanitary
cover inserted inside one end of an O-type toilet seat. The film sanitary
cover is pulled out from the end, covering the toilet seat, and then wound
and kept at the other end.However, in the automatic toilet seat sanitary cover providing
devices mentioned above, pull out mechanisms are needed to provide a 
pre-determined length of toilet seat sanitary cover on the toilet seat.
Mechanisms are also needed to cut a toilet seat sanitary cover at a pre-determined
length when a roller-shaped toilet seat sanitary cover is used.
Controlling systems and operating systems are also needed to control these
mechanisms. In addition, for large scale devices, a power supply is needed
to operate these mechanisms.Maintaining automatic toilet seat sanitary cover providing devices is
troublesome. When using batteries to operate these devices, maintenance
is still a problem since these batteries have to be changed periodically.The inventors of the present invention have investigated the above-noted
problems, studied various toilet seat sanitary cover providing
methods, and discovered that these problems can be solved by having a
toilet seat sanitary cover kept inside a toilet seat cover which provides a
toilet seat sanitary cover when the toilet seat
