The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that it further comprises a means for defining an 

identification code specific to each piloting axis, 
each module comprising a means for reading said 

identification code, in order to configure itself as a 
function of the axis according to which it must pilot. 
The device as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the connection means (5) comprises multiple 

connection points and cooperates with an external 
connector (6) grouping together the ends of the 

electrical links connected to the set of sensors (4)

irrespective of the axis according to which it must 
pilot, 
a power control circuit (26) enabling it to directly 
control the actuators (2, 3), 
a feed circuit (21), 
an I/O management circuit (27), and 
a filtering and protection circuit for protection 
against the effects of lightning and electromagnetic 

radiation (22). 
The device as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that each computing module (10) comprises at least 

one plug-in module (23) grouping together the circuit 
(27) managing the inputs and outputs of said computing 

module (10), and possibly, the circuit (26) controlling 
power to said actuators (2, 3). 
The device as claimed in one of claims 4 and 5,
