<ABSTRACT>
The very compact hydraulic assembly (1) for wall gas-fired boilers 
provided with a main heat exchanger (7), a secondary heat exchanger 

(10), a three-way valve (4), a differential manostat (3) for the 
three-way valve (4), a by-pass valve (5), a safety manostat (2), a 

safety valve, a plurality of connectors (12,13,14A,15A,16,17,18,19) 
for connecting external pipes of the main circuit (24,25,28,29) 

intended for heating purposes and the secondary circuit (23,26,27) 
intended for sanitary water is comprised of a single block (1) making 

possible the compact interconnection of said components without the 
use of intermediate pipes. The differential manostat (3) comprises a 

venturi (34), a connecting element (36) to the secondary heat 
exchanger (10) and a connecting element (15A) to the single block (1), 

integrally formed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to wall gas-fired boilers and,
more particularly, to
wall gas-fired boilers comprising an improved hydraulic assembly for the production of hot water for sanitary
purposes and for environmental heating purposes.It is known that the use of the wall gas-fired boilers in autonomous
heating systems for the combined production of hot water for sanitary
and heating purposes is more and more diffusing due to the advantages
obtainable both from the economic and environmental standpoints. In
these boilers there are tipically two separate hydraulic circuits,
i.e. a main circuit in which water heated by the combustion of gas in
burners located belong a first air-water heat exchanger flows and a
secondary circuit in which water heated in a second water-water heat
exchanger, tipically a plate-type heat exchanger flows.In the main circuit, the thermal carrier transports the heat directly
to the heating system comprising, for example radiating elements, and
indirectly to the water circuit for sanitary purposes through a second
water-water heat exchanger in which the heat exchange with the
sanitary water occurs. For the correct and safe operation of such
boilers a plurality of valves and interconnected control means are
necessary.One of the critical factors of these wall gas-fired boilers is the
limited space available inside thereof which requires the design of
well precise dimensions of the hydraulic components intended to be
arranged therein. It is therefore very important to design the overal
dimensions of the various components of the hydraulic assembly so that
it can be easily contained in the inside of the boiler, to optimize
the arrangement of said components for maintaining low costs and to
carry out an easy maintenance of said components while maintaining
high safety standards. One of the most serious disadvantages of the new gas-fired boilers is
given by the hydraulic connections among the various necessary control
components which often cause cumbersome and irrational arrangements.
The necessary connecting pipes cause often difficulties in the
assembling and maintenance operations and also very high manufacturing
costs.The aim of the present invention is to overcome the above disadvantages
and limitations by providing a gas-fired boiler comprising an improved hydraulic connection among the
valves and/or the various control means which minimizes the overal
dimensions and the costs while maintaining a good assembly facility.Efforts made for the same purpose are already
