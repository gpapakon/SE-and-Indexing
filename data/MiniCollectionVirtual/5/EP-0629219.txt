<ABSTRACT>
Blends of biodegradable polymers of hydroxybutyric acid and polyolefins of improved properties are produced by incorporating a compatibilising agent which comprises a block copolymer in which at least half of the mass of one block is represented by alkyl side chains and at least half of the mass of another block is represented by side chains which comprise hydroxy acid residues.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is known to blend polymers of different types in order 
for example to obtain plastics compositions possessing a 
combination of their properties. However, when the polymers 
are of dissimilar chemical composition they may be incompatible 
and such blends may possess poor mechanical properties due to 
localised segregation of the polymers and weak bonding at the 
interfaces between regions of different polymer composition. 
The problem is particularly acute when films are to be formed 
by a process which comprises stretching a sheet or film to 
reduce its thickness. This may be carried out in one, or in 
two substantially perpendicular directions in order for example 
to achieve axial or biaxial orientation of the film. Blends of 
polyolefins and polyesters are prone to such problems. It is desirable to achieve films which are readily 
biodegradable, as these can be used for example as components 
of disposable diapers, ostomy bags and even as ordinary 
wrappings with a reduction in problems of disposal after use. Very satisfactory biodegradable polymers comprise 
hydroxybutyrate groups (PHB polymers) especially those 
PHB polymers which also comprise hydroxyvalerate groups 
(PHB/PHV copolymers). Polymers of this type are described in 
for example our European Patents 52,459 and 69,497. However, 
although they can be formed into satisfactory films with care, 
when used alone there is a tendency with such polymers to 
produce a proportion of off-specification material and the 
manufacturing process is subject to considerable constraints. 
It is desirable therefore to devise improved polymer 
compositions of this type. We have found that blends of such polymers with 
polyolefins possess favourable properties provided that the 
components are rendered compatible. Polypropylene is 
particularly favourable and has the advantage that it degrades 
more readily than polyethylene especially if no antioxidants  
 
are present. It is however difficult to render these materials 
compatible with PHB polymers. We have found that such blends can be made with 
unexpectedly good properties by incorporating into them a 
compatibilising agent which comprises a block copolymer in 
which in at least one block (Block A) at least half of the mass 
of the block is represented by alkylene or preferably alkyl 
side chains, which preferably have straight chains and which 
are suitably at least five and preferably at most 20, for 
example six to twelve carbon atoms long, and in which in at 
least one other block (Block B) at

<CLAIMS>
A compatibilising agent which comprises a block copolymer in which in at 
least one block (Block A) at least half of the mass of the block is represented 

by alkylene or alkyl side chains and in which in at least one other block (Block 
B) at least half of the mass of the block is represented by side chains which 

comprise hydroxybutyric acid residues and optionally also other 
hydroxyalkanoate residues. 
A compatibilising agent as claimed in claim 1 in which at least half of the units 
of the side chains of Block B are hydroxybutyric acid residues and any 

remaining units of the side chain consist essentially of hydroxyvaleric acid 
residues. 
A compatibilising agent as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the mass ratio of 
Block A to Block B is in the range 5:1 to 1:5. 
A compatibilising agent according to claim 1 in which the main chain is a 
polyacrylic or methacrylic acid chain and the side chains are attached by ester 

linkages. 
A compatibilising agent according to claim 1 wherein the alkylene or alkyl side 
chains in Block A are straight chains of at least 5 carbon atoms in length. 
A compatibilising agent according to claim 5 wherein the alkylene or alkyl side 
chains in Block A are at most 20 carbon atoms long. 
A compatibilising agent according to claim 6 wherein the alkylene or alkyl side 
chains in Block A are 6 to 12 carbon atoms in length. 
A compatibilising agent according to claim 1 wherein at least 70% of Block B 
is represented by said side chains. 
A compatibilising agent according to claim 8 wherein the other  
 

hydroxyalkanoate residues in Block B are hydroxyvalerate residues.

comprises reacting together polyhydroxyalkanoic acid and a block copolymer 

of primary alkyl acrylate or methacrylate with a tertiary alkyl acrylate or 
methacrylate or acrylic or methacrylic acid. 
A process as claimed in claim 10 in which the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid 
comprises at least 50% of hydroxybutyric acid units. 
A process as claimed in claim 10 or 11 in which the reaction takes place in the 
presence of a polyolefine at an elevated temperature sufficient to melt the 

polyolefine under conditions of mixing.

claim 1.
