<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a process to recover phthalic 
anhydride from a plastic material which contains a phthalate 

ester as a plasticizer comprising the steps of: 

(a) heating the plastic material so that the plastic 
material is gasified to produce a first product, 
(b) contacting the first product with alumina 
catalyst so that the product is catalytically cracked to produce a 

first catalytically cracked product comprising phthalic 
anhydride; and 
(c) recovering phthalic anhydride from the first 
catalytically cracked product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of
cracking a plastic material into useful components and
recovering them. In addition, the present invention also relates
to an apparatus of carrying out the process according to the
present invention. The term "plastic material" is intended to
mean, in addition to, a plastic material such as a general-purpose
plastic material and an engineering plastic material, a
rubber material. Such a plastic material may be of any type, for
example, a waste material.Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 53-60974
describes a process in which a waste plastic material such as a
polyvinyl chloride plastic material is supplied into a retort,
which is heated to a temperature of not higher than 350 °C so as
to thermally decompose the material; a distilled organic
material comprising a plasticizer and its cracked materials are
burnt off while produced chlorine gas is recovered; and activated
carbon is recovered from a residue comprising carbonaceous
material after cracking.When a chlorine containing plastic material such as a
polyvinyl chloride is thermally decomposed and formed chlorine
gas is recovered as described above, effective source utilization 
is achieved by reusing the recovered chlorine gas. However,
since a plasticizer mainly comprising a phthalate ester
contained in the plastic material cannot be effectively cracked,
it is burnt off, for example, in a low temperature gasification
combustion process.Thus, there is a problem that an industrial useful
material such as phthalic anhydride which constitutes the
phthalic ester plasticizer cannot be utilized by the process as
described above, so that not only sources are wasted but also
such an effective material is degraded due to contamination by
the plasticizer and its cracked components. In addition, an
aliphatic hydrocarbon produced with cracking of the plasticizer
such as octanol is reacted with a chlorine compound such as
hydrogen chloride from the plastic material, whereby a
chlorinated hydrocarbon such as octyl chloride is produced of
which disposal causes a problem.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
overcome the above problems and provide a process of
effectively cracking a plastic material which contains a
phthalate ester as a plasticizer (such as a waste plastic
material and/or a waste rubber material) and recovering phthalic
anhydride (and optionally other compounds such as hydrogen
chloride, hydrocarbons and so on) from a cracked product, so that
the recovered anhydride (and optionally
