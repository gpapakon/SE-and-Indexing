<ABSTRACT>
A current detection method for current 
detection of an output of a PWM inverter utilitizes 

current sampling at the timings of two zero vectors of 
the PWM inverter and selecting the sample value least 

influenced by noise as the detected current sample value 
and, when a time difference between the two vectors is 

large, an average value of the two sample values is 
selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
current detection method according to the preamble of claim 1. 
Specifically, the invention relates to a 
current control method for digital current control 
applications using a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
inverter, particularly when a high carrier frequency is 
utilized. In such devices as variable speed motor driving 
arrangements, non-stop electrical sources and the like, 
PWM inverters are often employed for improving wave 
recognition. Further, when an IGBT (insulated-gate 
bipolar transistor), FET-MOS, high speed switching 
terminal or the like is employed in a main circuit of 
such a PWM inverter, an even higher level of improvement 
can be realized. In a PWM inverter, control of voltage and 
vector control are mutually dependent. For example, 
referring to Fig. 4, a block diagram of a PWM inverter 
for current control is shown. As may be seen, a vector 
control portion 1 requires a speed current demand. a 
torque current demand as well as a control frequency ωs 
and outputs a magnetic induction current demand i1d and a 
perpendicular torque demand i1q to an ACR portion 2. The 
ACR (digital current control) portion 2 receives both the 
magnetic induction current demand i1d and the torque 
current demand i1q and a detected current variation and 
performs proportional integral (PI) current control. 
Then, the ACR converts the phase input to a 3 phase 
output in the form of voltage demands Vu, Vv, Vw (and a 
coordinate signal) to a PWM (pulse wave modulation)  
 
pattern generator 3. AT the PWM pattern generator, from 
the voltage demands for each phase, the carrier frequency 
and pattern data from the pattern generator 3, PWM 
patterns for each phase are generated and output to a 
main circuit 4 from which a voltage and phase of the 
output are determined and supplied to an induction motor 
5. A speed detector 6 associated with the 
induction motor 5 outputs an angular speed signal ωr to 
an adder 7. Based on the angular speed signal ωr and 
the control frequency ωs the adder 7 outputs a 
electrical source angular speed signal ωo to the ACR 
portion 2. Further, a current detecting hall element 8, 
or the like is interposed between the main circuit 4 and 
the induction motor 5 and provides a sample of the 
detected current value for each phase via a sample and 
hold circuit 9. The current values for each phase sampled by 
the sample and hold circuit 9 are converted to a digital 
value at an A/D (analog/digital) converter 10 and the 
digital values are
