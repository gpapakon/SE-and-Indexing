<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of a conglomerate of gypsum and impermeable 

granulated cellular material with closed cells, 
characterized by the following operations: 


a) preparation of a mixture of powdered gypsum and 
cellular material, preferably polystyrene, containing a 

volume of 0.4 - 0.6 liters of cellular material to each 
liter of gypsum, and dry mixing of said mix; 
b) rapid pouring of said mix into a mixing bath 
provided with stirring means, said mixing bath 

containing an amount of water of between 50 and 70% by 
weight with respect to the amount of gypsum in the mix; 
c) mixing of the mix until it reaches a viscosity 
not exceeding 200 centistokes; 
d) pouring of the mixture into molds of the 
required shapes and sizes; 
e) partial extraction of the conglomerates thus 
obtained from the molds; 
f) complete extraction and drying and finishing 
operations. 
The conglomerates thus obtained, which also form 
an object of the invention, are particularly suitable 

for use in the construction of dividing walls in civil 
and industrial building constructions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of a conglomerate of gypsum and impermeable 
granulated cellular (foam) material with closed cells 
and to the conglomerate obtained thereby, which is 
particularly suitable to form dividing walls and 
internal walls in civil and industrial building 
constructions. Gypsum panels of a wide variety of shapes and 
sizes are already known from the state of the art, made 
up of gypsum-based conglomerates and which, especially 
in recent times, have been widely used in civil and 
industrial building constructions to form dividing 
walls. Panels of this sort are known from the state of 
the art, made of solid gypsum, of gypsum with a 
polystyrene core (sunk in the panel), of gypsum made 
light with aerating agents, or of gypsum with the 
addition of perlite, vermiculite and/or expanded clay. 
However, there are numerous serious problems in the use 
of panels made of materials or conglomerates such as 
those indicated above. As regards the panels made of solid gypsum, their 
main disadvantage is their great weight and the ease 
with which they absorb water. In houses or other 
structures under construction these elements are 
exposed to bad weather both before and during 
application, for example through open windows or 
through non-waterproofed roofing slabs, or are subject 
to contact with water poured onto the floor during 
work. Bearing in mind that the more water is absorbed 
the longer is the delay before subsequent operations 
can be carried out, it can easily be understood why 
attempts are made to obtain elements with low water 
absorption. Another reason for the use of a minimum amount of 
water in excess of the stoichiometric amount 
(approximately 20% by weight) is connected to the need  
 
to give the product a remarkable strength. It should be noted that during preparation of the 
gypsum/water mix it may be necessary or useful to use 
an amount of water in excess of the stoichiometric 
amount required to carry out the hemihydrate 
sulphate/bihydrate sulphate reaction, in order to 
improve the working/pouring characteristics of the 
semi-liquid mix. Clearly, the water in excess of the 
amount strictly necessary for complete hydration must 
be kept to a minimum according to working requirements, 
as an excess of water provokes an increase in the 
porosity of the finished product once this water (that 
is to say the water used to improve the working 
characteristics of the mixture) has evaporated. This 
provokes a consequent reduction in
