<ABSTRACT>
A frequency range of a digital audio signal is 
effectively expanded without increasing a sampling 

frequency which has been used for generating the digital 
audio signal. Firstly, the digital audio signal is 

divided into first and second digital audio signals. The 
first digital audio signal is delayed by a predetermined 

time duration in order to be combined, at a later time, 
with the second digital audio signal which is to be 

subject to digital processing. The second digital audio 
signal undergoes band-pass filtering. Thereafter, the 

frequency range of the second digital audio signal which 
has been band-pass filtered, is expanded. Following 

this, the second digital audio signal whose frequency 
range has been expanded is combined with the first 

digital audio signal which has been delayed. Thus, the 
digital audio signal is expanded in terms of its 

frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
improvements in audio signal processing, and more
specifically to a method of expanding a frequency range
of a digital audio signal without increasing a sampling
rate which has been utilized for converting an original
analog audio signal to the digital audio signal.With the advent of recent developments in digital
signal processing, it is often the case that an analog
audio signal such as a speech signal is converted into a
digital signal and then is stored, for later use, in an
appropriate storage medium such a RAM (random access
memory), a magnetic tape, etc.Before turning to the present invention it is deemed
advantageous to briefly discuss a known method wherein a
digital audio signal stored in storage medium is read out
thereof for driving a speaker after being converted into
the corresponding analog signal.Fig. 1 is a diagram schematically showing such a
known technique. The arrangement of Fig. 1 includes a
plurality of functional blocks together with three
sketches each of which schematically illustrates spectrum
distribution of a digital signal appearing at the
functional blocks.As shown in Fig. 1, an analog-to-digital (A/D)
converter 10 is supplied with an analog signal such as a
speech signal. The A/D converter 10 samples the incoming
analog signal and then quantizes the sampled values as is
well known in the art. A digital audio signal thus
obtained is stored in a suitable storage medium 12 such 
as a RAM. Representing a sampling rate as fs, a sampling
theorem tells us that the digital signal stored in the
storage medium 12 has a frequency spectrum (frequency
range) extending from 0Hz to fs/2.Therefore, if the A/D converter 10 samples the
incoming audio signal at a sampling rate of 8kHz, then
the digital signal stored has a frequency spectrum
ranging from 0Hz to 4kHz (= fs/2). Further, the digital
signal stored in the storage medium includes aliasing
noises inherently incurred during the sampling, as is
known in the art.A digital audio signal retrieved from the storage
medium 12 is applied to a digital signal processor 14.
The spectrum of the digital signal is schematically shown
in a sketch (A) of Fig. 1. As shown, the digital audio
signal (hatched portion) has a frequency range from 0Hz
to fs/2 and accompanying aliasing noises. The spectra of
the digital signal and the noises are symmetrical with
respect to the frequency fs/2.The digital signal processor 14 operates such as to
shift the aliasing noises toward a higher frequency
range. In other
