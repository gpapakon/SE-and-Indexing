<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with novel compounds of formula (I) having
superior gastrokinetic properties. The invention further relates to methods for preparing
such novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said novel
compounds as well as the use as a medicine of said compounds.Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1993, 36, pp 4121-4123 discloses 4-amino-N-[(1-butyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-5-chloro-2-methoxy-benzamide
as a potent and selective
5HT4-receptor antagonist.WO 93/05038, published on March 18, 1993 (SmithKline Beecham PLC) discloses a
number of substituted 4-piperidinylmethyl 8-amino-7-chloro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxamides
having 5HT4-receptor antagonistic activity.WO 94/10174, published on May 11, 1994 (SmithKline Beecham PLC) discloses a
number of substituted 4-pyridinylmethyl oxazino[3,2-a]indole-carboxamide derivatives
having 5HT4-receptor antagonistic activity.The above prior art documents all disclose substituted 4-piperidinylmethyl
carboxamides and the analogues thereof having 5HT4-receptor antagonistic activity.
Compounds showing 5HT4 antagonism are taught to have potential interest in the
treatment of, for example, irritable bowel syndrome, in particular the diarrhoea aspects
of irritable bowel syndrome, i.e. these compounds block the ability of 5HT (which
stands for 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, i.e. serotonin) to stimulate gut motility (see
WO-93/05038, page 8, lines 12 to 17). The present gastroprokinetic compounds differ
in structure mainly by the presence of a hydroxy- or an alkyloxy group on the central
piperidine ring.WO 93/16072, published on August 19, 1993 discloses 5-amino-N-[(1-butyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-8-carboxamide
having
5 HT4 receptor antagonistic activity.Bioorganic & Medicinal Chem. Lett., 1996, 6, pp. 263-266, and WO-96/33186
(Pharmacia S.P.A.), published on October 24, 1996, disclose 4-amino-N-(1-butyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl-5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-7-benzofurancarboxamide
having 5 HT4
receptor agonistic activity. The compounds of the present invention differ from the previous prior art documents
due to the presence of a hydroxy or a C1-6alkyloxygroup on the 3 position of the central
piperidine ring.EP-0,299,566, published on 18 January 1989, discloses N-(3-hydroxy-4-piperidinyl)benzamides
having gastrointestinal motility stimulating activity.EP-0,309,043, published on 29 March 1989, discloses substituted N-(1-alkyl-3-hydroxy-4-piperidinyl)benzamides
having gastrointestinal motility stimulating
activity.EP-0,389,037,
