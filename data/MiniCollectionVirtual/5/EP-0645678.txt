<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radiation-sensitive
composition. More specifically, this
invention relates to a pigment-dispersed radiation-sensitive
composition which has a good dispersibility
of a pigment, a good adhesion to a substrate and
excellent coating properties, and which is suited for
use in formation of a color filter used in a liquid
crystal display device or a solid state imaging device.As a method for producing a color filter of a
liquid crystal display device or a solid state imaging
device, a dyeing method, a printing method and an
electrodeposition method have been hitherto known. In
recent years, a lithographic method using a colored
radiation-sensitive composition is particularly
arousing interest from the aspects of a purity, a
dimensional accuracy and a process resistance.To produce a color filter by the lithographic
method using the radiation-sensitive composition, the
radiation-sensitive composition is coated onto a black
matrix formed on a glass substrate with a spin coater
or the like, and dried to form a coating. The coating
is then exposed to light and developed to obtain a
colored pixel. This process is repeated several times
using radiation-sensitive compositions different in
color to give a color filter. However, a pixel
obtained by using the conventional radiation-sensitive
composition is easily peeled off from the substrate,
and tends to give the color filter a deficiency. When
an adhesion of a pixel to a substrate is improved to
elominate this deficiency, a solubility of a non-pixel
portion to be dissolved away in a developer solution in
the development tends to decrease, and so-called
surface soiling and film remaining are prone to occur. As a technique to solve such problems, Laid-open
European Patent No. 0564168A2 proposes a
radiation-sensitive composition for use in a color
filter containing an alkali-soluble block copolymer of
a specific structure as a binder, a radiation-sensitive
compound and a pigment.It is an object of this invention to provide
a novel pigment-dispersed radiation-sensitive
composition.Another object of this invention is to
provide a pigment-dispersed radiation-sensitive
composition which does not cause the surface soiling,
which is excellent in adhesion of a formed pixel to a
glass substrate, and which is suited for use in
formation of a color filter.Still another object of this invention is to
provide a pigment-dispersed radiation-sensitive
composition which does not cause the surface soiling on
a black matrix and a glass substrate. which gives a
