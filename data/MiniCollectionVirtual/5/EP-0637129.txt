<ABSTRACT>
To control the amplitude of the channels in the receiver of a television distribution system, these receivers are controlled by pilot. To achieve a constant total modulation percentage, an aggregate load control is used in the transmitter. In known systems, the pilot signal is only fed into the automatic gain control (AGC). Independently of whether the aggregate load control is carried out first or the pilot signal is fed in, such a television distribution system has disadvantages since the pilot signal has no fixed relationship to the signal amplitudes of the incoming channels or the total modulation percentage cannot be kept constant. The invention is based on bringing a reference signal selected from the transmission signal into a fixed relationship with the pilot signal. This is advantageously via a feedback loop (RKS1, RKS3) via which either the channel amplitude is controlled to a predetermined value or via which a pilot signal used is controlled to a predetermined value.
