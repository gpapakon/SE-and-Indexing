<ABSTRACT>
In a recording/reproducing or transmitting/receiving device for 
compressed data, the temporal size of a processing block during the 

compression process is rendered variable in response to larger 
amplitude changes in the input signals. The device includes power 

calculating circuits (304 to 306) for calculating the masking effect on 
the processing block based on amplitude changes in the waveform on the 

time axis of various frequency bands of the processing block as well as 
on the power of a processing block(s) other than the processing block 

in subject for determining the temporal size of the processing block in 
subject, a primary block size decision circuit (310) and a block size 

correction circuit (311). The device enables the achievement of high 
efficiency compression and expansion with superior sound quality as 

perceived by the ear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for encoding a digital signal. Embodiments of the invention relate to recording and/or
reproducing or transmitting and/or receiving compressed data, for
example bit-compressed digital audio signals or the like, and to
recording media therefor.Our US Patents Nos. US-A-5 243 588 and US-A-5 244 705 disclose a
technique consisting in bit-compressing input digital audio signals and
recording the bit-compressed signals in a burst fashion with a pre-set
data volume as a recording unit.This technique resides in employing a magneto-optical disc as a
recording medium and recording and/or reproducing AD (adaptive
differential) PCM audio data as prescribed in audio data formats such
as CD-I (CD-Interactive) or CD-ROM XA. The AD-PCM audio data is
recorded in a burst fashion on the magneto-optical disc with e.g. 32
sectors of the AD-PCM data and a few linking sectors for interleaving
as one recording unit.Several modes of the AD-PCM audio data may be selected in the
recording and/or reproducing device employing the magneto-optical disc.
For example, a level A with a compression ratio twice that of the
conventional compact disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 37.8 kHz, a
level B with a compression ratio four times that of the conventional
compact disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 37.8 kHz and a level C
with a compression ratio eight times that of the conventional compact
disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 18.9 kHz, are prescribed. That
is, with the above-mentioned level B, the digital audio data is
compressed to approximately one fourth of the original volume, with the
replay time of the disc recorded with the level B mode being four times 
that with the standard CD format. This indicates that a
recording/reproducing time about as long as that achieved with a
standard size disc of 12 cm in diameter may be achieved with a smaller
sized disc and hence the device may be reduced in size.However, since the rotational speed of the disc is the same as
that of a standard CD, the amount of the compressed data obtained with
the level B per pre-set time is four times that of the standard CD.
Consequently, the same compressed data is read in superimposition four
times, in a time unit of e.g. a sector or a cluster, and only one of
the four superimposed compressed data is transmitted for audio
reproduction. Specifically, during scanning or tracking of a spiral
recording track, a track jump of returning to the starting track
position is performed for each revolution for repeatedly tracking
