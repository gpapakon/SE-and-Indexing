<ABSTRACT>
The fist means has a tray for mounting a recording and reproducing medium 
at a first position directly or through an auxiliary part, and coupling the 

turntable which is rotated by a disk driving motor of the main chassis with the 
driven part of the recording and reproducing medium at a second position, and 

this tray is designed to mount both a recording disk alone and a recording disk 
contained in a disk cartridge, while the second means couples the disk alone to 

the turntable at a first position of the main chassis, or puts the cartridge 
into the cartridge retaining means at the first position of the main chassis, 

and couples the recording disk in the cartridge to the turntable while reaching 
a second position of the main chassis, thereby recording and reproducing at the 

second position of the main chassis, and therefore the both means are commonly 
constituted to record and reproduce at the same position in both recording disk 

alone and the recording disk in the cartridge, so that both the recording disk 
alone and cartridge can be used by one apparatus. 
In the third means, in addition to the constitution of the first means, the 
holder moving up and down obliquely i
n the tray mounts plural types of disks 
concentrically, with ones larger in diameter at higher positions, at an 

obliquely lowered position, and the smaller cartridge of the plural types of 
cartridges is arranged concentrically with the disk alone, while the larger  

 
cartridge is deviated in the center in the moving direction of the tray, being 

put on higher positions, and when the tray moves to the recording and 
reproducing position and is coupled with the turntable, the holder is raised 

obliquely except for large cartridge, and all recording disks alone and 
recording disks in cartridge are at the same position, so that all media can be 

handled in one apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a disk recording and reproducing apparatus as set forth in the
preamble of claim 1. A disk recording and reproducing apparatus of this kind is
known from US-A-5 105 414.The apparatus of the prior art comprises a movable tray having depressions of
different diameter arranged in different heights adapted to receive disks of different
diameters.EP-A-0 576 253, which is prior art in accordance with Article 54 (3) EPC and considered as the closest prior art, discloses a
disk loading device for loading disks of different diameters on a disk rotating driving
device provided within an outer casing. The disk loading device includes a supporting
base provided with the disk rotating driving device and a disk transporting tray for
holding and transporting disks. The arrangement is adapted to handle both bare
disks of different diameters and disks arranged in cartridges.EP-A-0 518 259 discloses a disk recording and reproducing apparatus, which can
receive either a bare disk or a disk accommodated in a disk cartridge, said apparatus
comprising:
a main chassis having a turntable rotated by a disk driving motor and to be coupled
with a disk to be recorded or reproduced, and further having a head for recording into
or reproducing from said disk and being movable between a first position close to the
disk and a second position distant from the disk, and a first tray having a holder for
holding the bare disk and a second tray for holding the disk cartridge, both trays
being movable between a displaceable between a first loading and unloading position
and a second recording or reproducing position, in said second position the turntable
is brought into a position coupling the disk to be recorded or reproduced, wherein the
main chassis at its first position does not impede the transfer of the tray from its first
to its second position, and the main chassis at its second position enables the
turntable to be coupled with the disk accommodated in the cartridge at a position for
keeping a clearance between the disk accommodated in the cartridge and the inner
wall of the cartridge on the second tray, and when using a bare disk, instead of a
cartridge, that bare disk is coupled a the same turntable position with the turntable for
keeping a clearance to the holder on the first tray. In the apparatus for recording/reproducing on/from an optical disk, a
perspective view of prior art of loading mechanism for mounting the disk is
shown in Fig. 25, and sectional views for showing its operation are given in
Fig.
