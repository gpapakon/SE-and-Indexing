<ABSTRACT>
Method for the replacement of the roof portion of a 
thermally insulated refrigerated container 1 by placing sand­

wich panels 2, 2′ on the bearing edge 3. The peripheral space 
around the sandwich panels 2, 2′ is then foam-filled. Metal 

cover plates 8 are subsequently placed over the sandwich pan­
els 2, 2′ and the foam-filled spaces. These are fastened to 

the walls, for example by welding. The cover plates 8 can 
grip into one another by means of folded edges 11. The inven­

tion can be applied by untrained personnel in remote places 
with the use of simple equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method as described in 
the heading of claim 1. Such refrigerated containers circulate in large 
numbers around the entire world. In practice it has been found 
that the roofs of such refrigerated containers are in need of 
replacement after a certain time. For many unknown reasons, 
the roof portion develops leakages after a period, so that 
the refrigerated container concerned is no longer fit for 
use. The replacement of the roof portion is not in itself a 
difficult problem. However, trained personnel and to some 
extent special equipment are needed for the replacement of 
the roof with a new one. These facilities are however avail­
able in only a few places. Since the containers to be repaired 
are widely spread around the world, it is not economic to 
transport the containers to a central point for repair. The invention has for its object to produce a method 
for the replacement of the roof portion of a refrigerated 
container which can be carried out by personnel with limited 
or no training, with the use of simple equipment. This is achieved by adopting the steps described in 
the characterizing part of claim 1. By constructing the replacement roof portion from 
relatively small elements which can be handled without special 
equipment, the method according to the invention can be app­
lied practically anywhere. To carry out the repair, operations 
which demand trained labour are not essential. The mounting 
of the sandwich panels, the foam-filling of the empty spaces 
and the arranging of metal cover plates over the sandwich 
panels can be performed by untrained personnel. Neither does  
 
the fixing of the cover plates in relation to the walls of 
the container require any great degree of manual skill. The 
cover plates can, for example, be welded in position on the 
walls of the container. A simple welded joint is adequate for 
this purpose. Preferably, the sandwich panels are fixed with 
respect to the bearing edge by means of pop rivets. The sand­
wich panels can mate together by means of a tongue and groove 
joint. It is also possible to glue the sandwich panels 
firmly to the cover plates. The joint between adjacent metal 
cover plates can be brought about by the use of edge folds 
which grip into one another. The invention also relates to a kit for use in the 
replacement of the roof portion of a refrigerated container, 
where the refrigerated container has the standard dimensions 
12 x 2.38 x 2.38 metres, and the kit consists of ten sandwich 
panels each

<CLAIMS>
1. Method for the replacement of the roof portion 
of a freight container, in particular a thermally insulated 

refrigerated container, on the inside of which is arranged an 
encompassing bearing edge supporting the roof portion, and of 

which the insulation layer is formed by a "sandwich" construc­
tion, characterized in that, after removal of the roof por­

tion, sandwich panels are placed close-fitting on the bearing 
edge, the peripheral space around the sandwich panels is foam-­

filled, and metal cover plates are subsequently placed over 
the sandwich panels and the foam-filled spaces and these pla­

tes are fastened to the walls of the container. 
2. Method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the sandwich panels are fixed with respect to the bearing 

edge using fastening means. 
3. Method as claimed in claims 1-2, characterized 
in that the sandwich panels are joined to one another by use 

of a tongue and groove joint. 
4. Method as claimed in claims 1-3, characterized 
in that the cover plates are welded in position to the walls 

of the container. 
5. Method as claimed in claims 1-4, characterized 
in that the sandwich panels are sealed with respect to the 

foam in the peripheral space with polyurethane tape. 
6. Method as claimed in claims 1-5, characterized 
in that the sandwich panels are glued firmly to the cover 

plates. 
7. Method as claimed in claims 1-6, characterized 
in that the metal cover plates grip into one another by means 

of folded edges. 
8. Method as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that the folded edges are sealed off by a spraying operation. 
9. Kit for use in the replacement of the roof por­
tion of a refrigerated container with the standard dimensions 

of 12 x 2.38 x 2.38 metres, consisting of ten sandwich panels 
each measuring 2.20 x 1.20 x 0.08 metres, and eight galvanized 

steel cover plates, pre-pressed polyurethane tape and poly­
urethane foam sealing material.
