<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises grinding the dried fruit skin, 
especially almond shell, to specific grain sizes, and 

mixing the same with stearic acid or paraffin, and 
thermoplastic derivatives, to yield a compression or 

injection mouldable material to obtain several objects, 
in particular packages, stoppers, furniture and the like, 

of an ecological and recyclable kind.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present Invention relates to a process to 
manufacture an ecological and recyclable material for 
constructing various moulded objects and the material 
thus obtained, adding a number of advantages to the 
function for which it is intended that shall be described 
hereinafter, in addition to other advantages inherent in 
its constitution. A great many materials are currently known that can 
be shaped or moulded, called plastics, for instance 
polymers, which combined with other ingredients such as 
curing, strengthening, softening and other agents, make 
up a mixture that can be heat and pressure shaped or 
moulded. There is therefore a large number of plastics that 
can be compression or injection moulded, applied mainly 
to such areas as packing materials, furniture and sundry 
industrial components. These materials, so-called plastics, the result of 
processing matter that mankind has to hand, have 
contributed to a significant industrial development of 
humanity, and yet have contemporaneously created waste 
that is gradually building up on earth, damaging the 
environment. The seriousness of the problem has led to a 
collective worldwide awareness tending to try and achieve 
a reasonable balance between development and ecology. The foregoing problem has increased research in an 
attempt at achieving ecological and recyclable materials, 
unlike traditional materials, to take their place 
advantageously in the various fields of industrial 
application.  The applicant for this Invention has conceived a new 
ecological and recyclable material, designed to overcome 
the problems described in the foregoing section, using to 
such end a basic natural component obtained from dried 
fruit skin, preferably almond shells, which skins undergo 
a number of grinding and mixing processes with other 
ingredients, such as stearic acid, paraffins and several 
thermoplastic material derived products, in order to 
obtain a pressure or injection mouldable material to 
shape parts with an assorted geometry and size, depending 
upon the mould used. The present Invention affords the foregoing 
advantages and others that shall be easily inferred from 
the embodiment that shall be described in detail 
hereinafter to make the understanding of the features set 
out above easier. The almond shell is ground to powder form with a 
grain size of between one and ten tenths. Stearic acid is 
added at a rate of 3/4 of a gramme per shell kilogramme, 
or else 1 gramme of paraffin per shell kilogramme. Any 
thermoplastic material

<CLAIMS>
1.- A process to manufacture an ecological and 
recyclable material for constructing various moulded 

objects and the material thus obtained, characterised in 
that a first stage involves grinding the dried fruit skin 

to powder form: adding stearic acid or paraffin, together 
with thermoplastic material derived products, to the said 

powder form material; and a final stage involves mixing 
said components in a suitable mixer at 32,000 revolutions 

per minute, for a time ranging between one and five 
minutes, a material being obtained that can be 

compression moulded in moulds appropriate for the object 
to be achieved, under a pressure of between 800 and 1500 

tonnes, and a temperature of between 160째 and 200째, or 
injection moulded at a temperature of between 160째 and 

200째 and a pressure of between 1700 kilogrammes and 3000 
kilogrammes, the process time being 15 seconds. 
2.- A process to manufacture an ecological and 
recyclable material for constructing various moulded 

objects and the material thus obtained, as in claim 1, 
characterised in that the material comprises almond shell 

ground to a grain size of between 1 and 10 tenths; 3/4 of 
a gramme of stearic acid per shell kilogramme; and 

polypropylene, polystyrene, acetalic resins and other 

thermoplastic family derivatives, at a rate of 30% to 90% 
per almond shell kilogramme. 
3.- A process to manufacture an ecological and 
recyclable material for constructing various moulded 

objects and the material thus obtained, as in claim 2, 
characterised in that the material comprises almond shell 

ground to a grain size of between 1 and 10 tenths; 1 
gramme of paraffin per shell kilogramme; and 

thermoplastic family derivatives, at a rate of 30% to 90% 
per almond shell kilogramme.
