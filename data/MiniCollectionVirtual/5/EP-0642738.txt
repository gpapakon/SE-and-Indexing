<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for separating substances of different viscosities which are mixed with one another, which device is equipped with a hollow drum (2) which is driven in a rotary manner and has a perforated casing surface (3) which is enclosed over part of its circumference by an endless pressing belt (5) which can be pressed against the hollow drum. In order to release the pressing residues from the outer casing surface of the hollow drum, a stripping blade (13) is provided, which is arranged so as to float in an essentially radial direction.

<CLAIMS>
Equipment for separating intermixed substances of different flowability, especially
for the purpose of preparation of foodstuffs, comprising a rotationally driven hollow drum

(2) with perforated circumferential surface (3), an endless press belt (5) externally
pressable thereagainst whilst looping around a part of the circumference of the hollow

drum (2), as well as means (12) for stripping the pressed stock at the inner and outer
circumferential surface of the hollow drum (2), characterised in that at least the means (12)

for stripping comprises at the outer circumferential surface (3) a stripper blade (13), which
is supported by at least one support element (14) and which with respect to the hollow

drum is arranged to be floating in substantially radial direction, wherein the support
element permits a displaceability of the stripper blade in its longitudinal extent in

substantially axial direction with respect to the hollow drum and the stripper blade is
supported at points and wherein the stripper blade is pressed against the outer

circumferential surface (3) of the hollow drum by means of force means acting in the plane
of the blade.
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised in that the stripper blade (13) is
guided parallelly to the rotational axis of the hollow drum (2).
Equipment according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the force means are
constructed as a spring element (23).
Equipment according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the force means are
constructed as a hydraulically or pneumatically operated force transmitter.
