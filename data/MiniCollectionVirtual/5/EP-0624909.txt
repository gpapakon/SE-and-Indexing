<ABSTRACT>
A geometry for the metal contacts in a lateral MOSFET 
is disclosed. The cross-sectional shape of the metal 

contacts, which is usually six-sided but may also be a 
parallelogram, maximizes the cross-sectional area of the 

contacts while maintaining a required clearance from the 
gate layer and a required overhang of the lines in an 

overlying metal layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lateral MOSFETs, and in
particular, to means for establishing contact between a metal
layer and the source and drain cells of the MOSFET.Reference is now made to Figures 1-3 of the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 illustrates the layout of source and rain cells
in a typical lateral MOSFET,Figs. 2A and 2B illustrate top plan and cross-sectional
views, respectively, of a cell in a typical lateral MOSFET,
andFig. 3 illustrates a top plan view of a junction between
a metal contact and a diagonal metal line.In a lateral MOSFET, the source and drain diffusions
are located on a single surface of a semiconductor
substrate. While lateral MOSFETs can be constructed of
long alternating stripes of source and drain regions
separated by a gate stripe, it is well known that a closed
cell arrangement typically provides a lower on-resistance
in a given area. In such closed cell lateral MOSFET
designs the cells are arranged in rows and columns as
shown in Fig. 1, wherein cells alternate between source
and design regions in both columns and rows. Source and
drain metal interconnection lines are then deposited
diagonally, such that the source and drain metal lines
alternate with one another across the face of the chip.Figs. 2A and 2B illustrate top and cross-sectional
views, respectively, of a typical cell. In this example,
a diffusion 20 of N+ type material is made in a P
substrate 21. The N+ diffusion is accessed by a metal
contact 22. The metal contact 22 is surrounded laterally
by a layer of gate material 23, typically polysilicon,
which is separated from the top surface of substrate 21 by
a gate oxide layer 24. A thermal oxide layer 25 and a
thick oxide layer 26 separate the polysilicon gate 23 from
the metal contact 22.To prevent a short between metal contact 22 and
polysilicon gate 23, which would destroy the MOSFET, a
minimal clearance, shown as "x" in Figs. 2A and 2B, must 
be maintained between them. If this minimal distance is
not maintained, errors in alignment, for example, may
create a short between the metal contact and the gate. A
typical value of x is 1 Âµm. To minimize the on-resistance
of the transistor, it is desirable to have the cross-sectional
area of the metal contact 22 be as large as
possible for a given size opening in the gate. Therefore,
assuming that the opening in the polysilicon gate is a
square, the cross-section of metal contact 22 would
ordinarily be a smaller square separated from the gate by
the minimal distance x on all sides.Fig. 3 is a top plan view of
