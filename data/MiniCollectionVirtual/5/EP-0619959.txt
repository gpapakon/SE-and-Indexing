<ABSTRACT>
Waterproof and transpiring sole (10) for footgear 
including a tread (11) made of leather or similar material 

which is at least partially covered, in an upward region, 
by a membrane (12) made of vapor-permeable and waterproof 

material. The tread is assembled, at least along its 
perimeter, together with at least one upper part (13) made 

of rubber or equivalent material which has a central 
opening (14) in the region affected by the membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waterproof and
vapour-permeable sole for footgear.As is known, the main problem observed in using
footgear having a normal sole made of a natural material,
such as leather or equivalent materials, is wet weather.DE-A-4002667 discloses footgear which includes a
leather sole and an upper with a multiple layer watertight
and breathable inner lining. The outer upper and inner
lining upper are stitched to the shoe edge.When rain and bad weather make the streets wet and
slippery, it is in fact unadvisable to use footgear with
leather soles, since the leather, indeed because it is
vapor-permeable and healthy for the foot, is not waterproof
but on the contrary absorbs water.The thinner the leather, the faster it becomes
impregnated with water or moisture until it wets the user's
foot.This drawback also combines with the fact that the
leather tread has no pattern, is smooth, or often even
polished with waxes.This is an additional problem in wet weather, since
grip is unreliable in such conditions.Accordingly, use of soles with a leather tread is
limited by weather conditions and for this reason footgear
made of this kind of material is generally provided by
manufacturers in the summer collections in countries where
the dry season is predominant.Up to now, this drawback has been obviated by inserting
between the leather tread and the foot resting region a
polyurethane or PVC element, which however inhibits 
transpiration and confines the use of leather to a mere
aesthetic effect.A principal aim of the present invention is to provide
a sole that solves the drawbacks described above in known
types of footgear with a leather tread.A further aim is to provide a sole having also good
characteristics of grip on the ground in all conditions of
use.Another aim of the present invention is to provide a
sole having also shock-absorbing characteristics.Another important aim is to provide a sole having the
same advantages as those with a leather tread that are
currently commercially available.Another aim is to increase user comfort.Another aim of the invention is to provide a sole that
can be manufactured at a low cost and can thus be sold at a
competitive price.Another aim is to provide a sole that can be
manufactured with known equipment and methods.With this and other aims in view, there is provided,
according to the present invention, a waterproof and vapour-permeable
sole as defined in the appended claims.Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become

<CLAIMS>
Waterproof and vapour-permeable sole (10;110;210)
for footgear, comprising:


a tread (11;111;211) made of leather or of a similar
material with respect to vapour permeability;
a membrane (12;113;212) of vapor-permeable and
waterproof material which at least partially covers said

tread in an upward region; and
at least one upper part (13;114;213) made of rubber or
equivalent material with respect to impermeability which is

assembled together with said tread at least along its
perimeter and which has one or more through holes

(14;115;214) at least in the regions affected by said
membrane, and said upper part covering at least the

peripheral regions of said membrane.
Sole according to claim 1, characterized in that
said upper part (114) made of rubber or equivalent material

passes through said tread, in through holes (112) thereof,
with studs (116) with which it is provided, said studs

ending substantially at the ground contact level.
Sole according to claim 2, characterized in that
said upper part is made of soft shock-absorbing materials

such as polyurethane, EVA or equivalent materials.
Sole according to claim 2, characterized in that
said upper part made of rubber or equivalent material is

covered by a part made of soft shock-absorbing material such
as polyurethane, EVA or equivalent materials with through

holes at said membrane.
Sole according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said membrane substantially

covers the plantar region and is spaced from the edge of
said tread along its perimeter.
Sole according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said membrane is joined to

said tread by means of adhesives which are spread so that
they do not hinder transpiration.
Sole according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said membrane made of vapor-permeable

and waterproof material is constituted by the
material with the registered trademark "Gore-Tex" or by

equivalent material.
Sole according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said upper part made of rubber

or equivalent material affects the perimeter of said tread
and covers the edges of said membrane.
Sole according to claim 8, characterized in that
said upper part made of rubber or equivalent material is

assembled onto said tread by injection molding, by pouring
into a mold, by stitching, by gluing or by an equivalent

technique.
Sole according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said one or more through holes

of said upper part made of rubber or other equivalent
material have tapered edges.
