<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inductively excited ion beam gun. 
Specifically, the invention relates to a method and apparatus to create ions by ionizing 
a gas by means of a radio-frequency excited coil. Such an ion beam gun is known from the publication of 
Freisinger et al "Fusion Technology Conference", 4 - 9 
Sept. 1978, Padova Italy (Publisher: Pergamon, Oxford, 
U.K., 1979, pages 251 - 256) and includes a vessel filled 
with a gas to be ionized and surrounded by a coil. The 
coil is connected to a source of high-frequency, so that 
the gas inside of the vessel is ionized into positively 
charged ions which are extracted from the vessel by an 
extraction grid. Ion beam sources have been used for a multitude of applications from 
space propulsion to etching and sputter deposition of films used in semiconductors and 
optical films. All of these applications ionize gas molecules by removing electrons to 
cause the gas molecule to become a positively charged ion. The simplest of these ionizing methods was to use a filament, or 
thermionic emitter, to generate electrons within the ionization chamber. The 
electrons created by the filament collided with the gas molecules, knocking off 
electrons from the gas molecules to cause the molecules to become positively charged. 
This method, although operable, had several disadvantages. The filaments tended to 
have a short life. Because the filaments were thermionic emitters and were at a 
negative electrical potential relative to the ionized gas, material was sputtered off of 
the filament which caused contamination to be introduced into the ion beam. An improvement upon the filament type of ion generation was the 
introduction of a hollow cathode. This eliminated the need of a filament and greatly 
increased the operational life. Potentials for contamination of the ion beam due to 
materials present in the hollow cathode were still present. Further advances of ion beam generating devices included using a 
high-frequency generator coupled to either plates or coils within the chamber to ionize 
the gas molecules through excitation by the high-frequency energy. These materials. 
especially coils within the plasma field, also created contamination in the ion beam. 
An advancement, placing a coil outside the gas chamber helped to eliminate this 
contamination. However, external magnetic fields were usually required to contain 
the plasma within the chamber enhancing ionization efficiency and preventing arcing 
from the plasma to various components within the
