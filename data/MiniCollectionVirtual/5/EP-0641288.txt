<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a dual reel cord take-up device for flat wire cable which has a generally semi-cylindrical upper and lower case half (11, 12) which snap together over a dual-purpose shaft (16) to make two compartments. The first compartment (13) is a cord take-up compartment which is divided in two by a slotted rib (20) on the shaft in that compartment. Flat wire cable is received in both sides of the compartment through apertures (19, 19') in the walls of the compartment. In the second compartment (14) is a flat coil spring (23) fixed on its outside end to a generally cylindrical spring cup (24) within the compartment, and fixed on its inside end to the dual-purpose shaft in that compartment. The spring cup is held against rotation except to tighten the spring, so the shaft is continually under tension to rotate and retrieve the cable into the take-up compartment.

<DESCRIPTION>
Technical Field. This invention relates generally to
take-up devices for electrical cords, and more particularly
to those take-up devices for flat wire cables used in
communications and data transmission. What we have invented
is an economical dual reel cord take-up device.Background Art. U.S. Patent No. 4,646,987 (Peterson)
discloses a single reel take-up device for connecting a
telephone and a cooperating handset.The closest prior art is U.S. Patent No. 3,211,496, to
Zaydel. It discloses a dual reel cord take-up device for
flat wire cable having a generally semi-cylindrical upper
case half 27 having snap fit means 34, 36 for receiving a
lower case half 28 and means for receiving a flat wire
cable 16, 18. It also includes a generally semi-cylindrical
lower case half 28 also having a snap fit
means 34, 36 for receiving and cooperating with the upper
case half snap fit means for receiving and retaining said
upper case half in fixed relationship with the lower half. 
The lower half case also has means for receiving flat wire
cable 16, 18. A dual purpose shaft 25 is supported and
held in rotatable relationship by both the upper and lower
case halves 27, 28. The shaft 25 being provided, on its
second end, with a slot 54 in the shaft for receiving a
spring 26. A flat coil spring is fixed at its outer end
64 and being fixed at its inner end 62 to said slot 54 of
said second end of the dual purpose shaft 25.Our co-pending application Serial No. 07/532,648
discloses a dual reel cord take-up device with a cord slot
hole 31 in main spool disk 28, side spool disk 32 and main
spring housing 40.Still, there is a need in the cord take-up industry
for a more economical dual reel take-up device with fewer
parts and which may be more easily manufactured.The invention thus relates to 
a dual reel cord take-up device for flat wire cable
having:
(a) a generally semi-cylindrical upper case half
having snap-fit means for receiving a lower case half and
means for receiving a flat wire cable;(b) a generally semi-cylindrical lower case half,
also having snap-fit means for receiving and cooperating
with said upper case half snap-fit means for receiving and
retaining said upper case half in fixed relationship, said
lower case half having means for receiving a flat wire
cable;(c) a dual-purpose shaft supported and held in
rotatable relationship by both said upper and lower case
halves; said shaft being provided with a slot in the shaft
for receiving a spring; and(d) a flat coil spring being fixed on its inner end
to said slot;

A dual reel cord take-up device for flat wire cable
having:


(a) a generally semi-cylindrical upper case half
having snap-fit means (18, 18') for receiving a lower case

half (12) and means (19') for receiving a flat wire cable;
(b) a generally semi-cylindrical lower case half
(12), also having snap-fit means (18, 18') for receiving

and cooperating with said upper case half snap-fit means
(18, 18') for receiving and retaining said upper case half

(11) in fixed relationship, said lower case half (12)
having means (19) for receiving a flat wire cable;
(c) a dual-purpose shaft (16) supported and held in
rotatable relationship by both said upper (11) and lower

(12) case halves; said shaft (16) being provided with a
slot (22) in the shaft (16) for receiving a spring (23);

and
(d) a flat coil spring (23) being fixed on its inner
end to said slot (22);

   which is characterised in that:

(e) the generally semi-cylindrical upper case half (11)
has two parallel compartments in a direction perpendicular

to the axis of the cylinder, the first compartment (13)
being adapted to receive the first end (15) of the dual-purpose

shaft (16), and the second compartment (14) being
adapted to receive second end (17) of said dual-purpose

shaft (16) and a spring cup (24);
(f) the generally semi-cylindrical lower case half
(12) also has two compartments which correspond to said

first (13) and second (14) compartments of said upper case
half (11), said second compartment having means for holding

said spring cup (24) in said second compartment (14)
against rotation in one direction but not the other;
(g) the dual-purpose shaft (16) includes a first end 
(15) which is located in said first compartment (13) of

said upper (11) and lower (12) case halves; said first end
(15) being provided with a slotted rib (20) which divides

said first end (15) of the shaft (16) into two adjacent
reels for receiving flat wire cable;
(h) the dual-purpose shaft (16) also includes a
second end (17) which is located in said second (14)

compartment of said upper (11) and lower (12) case halves,
sai
d second end (17) being provided with said slot (22) of
the dual-purpose shaft (16); and
(i) the spring cup (24) is generally cylindrical and
located within said second (14) compartment of said upper

(11) and lower (12) case halves, said spring cup (24)
having an outer surface (25) perpendicular to its axis of

rotation means (26) cooperating with the holding means (28)
to hold the cup (24) against rotation relative to said

upper (11) and lower (12) case halves in one direction but
not in the other direction and spring stop means (27) on

its inner cylindrical surface for fixing one end of the

The take-up device of Claim wherein the axial
surface of the dual-purpose shaft (16) in the first

compartment (13) is an enlarging spiral in the direction
of rotation when cable is being added to the shaft.
The take-up device of Claim 1 wherein the holding
means (28) in the second compartment (14) are notches

which notches cooperate and interact with the cooperating
