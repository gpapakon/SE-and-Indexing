<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variant of a human Kunitz-type 
protease inhibitor domain, DNA encoding the variant, a 
method of producing the variant and a pharmaceutical composition 
containing the variant. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) and 
mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes) play an important part in 
tissue injury, infection, acute and chronic inflammation and 
wound healing. The cells migrate from the blood to the site of 
inflammation and, following appropriate stimulation, they 
release oxidant compounds (O2·, O2-, H2O2 and HOCl) as well as 
granules containing a variety of proteolytic enzymes. The 
secretory granules contain, i.a., alkaline phosphatase, 
metalloproteinases such as gelatinase and collagenase and serine 
proteases such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and 
proteinase 3. Latent metalloproteinases are released together with tissue 
inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP). The activation mechanism 
has not been fully elucidated, but it is likely that oxidation 
of thiol groups and/or proteolysis play a part in the process. 
Also, free metalloproteinase activity is dependent on 
inactivation of TIMP. In the azurophil granules of the leukocytes, the serine 
proteases neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase-3 are 
packed as active enzymes complexed with glucosaminoglycans. 
These complexes are inactive but dissociate on secretion to 
release the active enzymes. To neutralise the protease activity, 
large amounts of the inhibitors α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI)  
 
and α1-chymotrypsin inhibitor (α1-ChI) are found in plasma. 
However, the PMNs are able to inactivate the inhibitors locally. 
Thus, α1-PI which is the most important inhibitor of neutrophil 
elastase is sensitive to oxidation at the reactive centre (Met-358) 
by oxygen metabolites produced by triggered PMNs. This 
reduces the affinity of α1-PI for neutrophil elastase by 
approximately 2000 times. After local neutralisation of α1-PI, the elastase is able to 
degrade a number of inhibitors of other proteolytic enzymes. 
Elastase cleaves α1-ChI and thereby promotes cathepsin G 
activity. It also cleaves TIMP, resulting in tissue degradation 
by metalloproteinases. Furthermore, elastase cleaves 
antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II, and tissue factor 
pathway inhibitor (TFPI) which probably promotes clot formation. 
On the other hand, the ability of neutrophil elastase to degrade 
coagulation factors is assumed to have the opposite effect so 
that the total effect of elastase is unclear. The
