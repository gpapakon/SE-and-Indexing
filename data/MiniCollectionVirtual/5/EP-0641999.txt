<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring the flow of a liquid flowing through a measuring tube, having a coil arranged above the measuring tube, a coil arranged below the measuring tube and two electrodes arranged opposite each other on the sides of the measuring tube, in which device the coils can be excited to generate magnetic fields in the same direction and in opposite directions and a correction circuit is provided. The correction circuit corrects the voltage between the electrodes, which voltage is only approximately proportional to the flow of the liquid in the case of magnetic fields in the same direction, by means of a correction function which is a function of the voltages between the electrodes in the case of magnetic fields in the same direction and in opposite directions, to form an output signal proportional to the flow of the liquid. The invention is characterised in that the voltage corresponding to the magnetic fields in the same direction and the correction function are fed to a comparator which, as a function of whether the relation between this voltage and the correction function corresponds to a sub-critical movement or to a super-critical movement of the liquid through the measuring tube, feeds a signal corresponding to the correction function to a correlator assigned to the sub-critical movement, to generate a correction signal corresponding to the sub-critical movement, or to a correlator assigned to the super-critical movement, to generate a correction signal corresponding to the super-critical movement, and in that using the one correction signal or the other correction signal, the voltage corresponding to the magnetic fields in the same direction is corrected to generate the output signal.

Device for measuring the flow of a fluid flowing through
a measuring pipe (2), comprising


a coil (4) arranged above said measuring pipe (2),
a coil (6) arranged below said measuring pipe (2), and
a pair of electrodes (8, 10) facing each other, on the sides
of said measuring pipe (2),

wherein said coils (4, 6) are excitable for producing aiding
and opposing magnetic fields,


and a correction circuit is provided for correcting the
voltage (Ur) between s
aid electrodes (8, 10) only
approximately proportionate to the flow of the fluid in the

presence of aiding magnetic fields to an output signal (S)
proportionate to the flow of the fluid by means of a

correction function (Ug/Ur) depending on the voltages (Ur, Ug)
between the electrodes in the presence of aiding and opposing

magnetic fields,
characterised in that
 the correction function (Ug/Ur) is
supplied to a correlator (40) associated with the flowing

movement (Fr 
<
 1) for producing a correction signal (α n)
representing the flowing movement, and to a correlator (42)

associated with the rushing movement (Fr 
>
 1) for producing a
correction signal (α s) representing the rushing movement, and

that the voltage (Ur) corresponding to the aiding magnetic
fields and the correction function (Ug/Ur) are supplied to a

comparator (32) which in response to whether the relation
between this voltage (Ur) and the correction function (Ug/Ur) 

corresponds to a flowing movement (F 
<
 1) or a rushing
movement (Fr 
>
 1) of the fluid through the measuring pipe (2)
causes the voltage (Ur) corresponding to the aiding magnetic

fields to be corrected by means of the one correction signal
(α n) or the other correction signal (α s) for producing the

output signal (S).
Device according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the
correction function (Ug/Ur) is formed by the quotient from the

voltage (Ug) corresponding to the opposing magnetic fields and
the voltage (Ur) corresponding to the aiding magnetic fields,

and

that the output signal (S) represents the product from the
voltage (Ur) corresponding to the aiding magnetic fields and

the respective correction signal (α n, α s).
