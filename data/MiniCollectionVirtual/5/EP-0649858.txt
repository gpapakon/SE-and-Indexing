<ABSTRACT>
A method of making polymeric particles having 
an average particle diameter of from 200 to 1,000 

micrometers which comprises forming a suspension of 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer droplets in a 

continuous aqueous phase, the aqueous phase containing 
an effective amount of a particulate suspension 

stabilizer to limit the coalescence of the monomer 
droplets within the average particle diameter range of 

200 to 1,000 micrometers, adding to the aqueous phase 
a water soluble protective colloid and polymerizing the 

monomer droplets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
preparing polymeric particles and particularly to a 
method of preparing large uniformly sized polymeric 
particles which have particular application as grinding 
media in milling apparatus for the preparation of small 
particle pharmaceutical products. The invention is 
also applicable for the preparation of particles for 
the electrophotographic and cosmetic industries. U.S. Patent 5,145,684 relates to particles 
having a size less than 400 nanometers which can be 
formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by the use 
of a grinding media such as stabilized zirconium oxide, 
stainless steel, alumina, titantia and the like. EP-A-0 600 528 
entitled 
Method of Grinding Pharmaceutical Substances is an 
improvement on the invention of the foregoing U.S. 
patent and relates to using polymeric particles having 
a size in the range of from about 0.1 to 3 mm as a 
grinding media to prepare pharmaceuticals. U.S. Patents 2,932,629; 2,934,530; 4,833,060 
and 5,133,992 describe a method of making particulate 
materials by a process known as limited coalescence. 
In this process, a solid particulate colloidal 
stabilizer, such as silica, is used to limit the 
coalescence of droplets containing polymerizable 
monomer in an aqueous medium. The monomer droplets 
within the aqueous medium include other materials such 
as initiators and the like necessary for completing the 
reaction to form polymer particles. The droplets are 
formed by a sizing operation including homogenization 
mixing and the like and are stabilized against further  
 
growth by the action of the solid particulate colloidal 
stabilizer. The reaction is then completed forming the 
polymeric particles. While this technique has been employed to 
prepare fairly uniform sized polymeric particles, it 
has not been found useful in the preparation of larger 
sized polymeric particles, ie, particles having an 
average diameter greater than 200 micrometers. Thus, there is a substantial need for a 
method of making uniformly sized particles having an 
average diameter greater than 200 micrometers for a 
number of uses including the grinding media for 
pharmaceutical products, as carrier particles in the 
electrophotographic industry and the like. The invention contemplates a method of 
preparing particulate polymeric beads having a uniform 
size distribution and an average particle diameter from 
about 200 to about 1,000 micrometers by forming a 
suspension of monomer droplets having a particle size 
of at least 200
