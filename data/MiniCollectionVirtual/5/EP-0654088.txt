 NOVEL FLK-2 AND ANALOGSINTRODUCTIONTechnical FieldThe field of this invention is the identification and use of hematopoietic factor receptors.BackgroundThe process for the development of hematopoietic cells from a self-regenerating stem cell to the mature multi-lineage cells has been the subject of intense investigation. How the host is able to direct a single cell into the multiplicity of pathways which provide such varied cells as lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes and osteoclasts, which is not a complete list, still remains to be elucidated. However, substantial strides have been made in identifying various intermediate cells associated with the different lineages and identifying factors which appear to direct, either by themselves or in combination with other factors, the cells to mature to a particular cell type. For the most part, the factors have been associated with progenitors which are committed to a particular lineage, where the factors result in maturation of the progenitor. Less is known about the factors which direct a totipotent or multipotent cell to be directed to one among many possible lineages . 

In order to understand the processes of differentiation and maturation, it will be necessary to know which surface membrane proteins act as receptors for transduction of signals, whether they have soluble forms, the role of soluble forms, and which ligands are associated with the surface membrane proteins. It is therefore of substantial interest to be able to identify ligands, receptors and their soluble forms associated with cell regeneration, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation.Relevant LiteratureJordan et al . (1990) Cell 81, 953-963 and Matthews et al . (1991) Cell 65:1143-1152 describe isolation of fetal liver stem cells and molecular cloning of FLK-2, a putative stem cell growth factor receptor. Jordan and Lemischka (1990) Genes and Development 4:220-232 describe a clonal and systemic analysis of long-term hematopoiesis in the mouse.Summary of the InventionA soluble form of FLK-2 molecule (SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:4) is provided where the soluble form lacks the transmembrane sequence as well as portions of the extracellular and intra-cellular sequences. In addition, a partial nucleic acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:5) of the gene for human FLK-2 is provided.DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTSMethods and compositions are provided associated with the mammalian regulation of hematopoiesis. Particularly, a soluble form of the mammalian fetal liver kinase-2
