<ABSTRACT>
In a double bag for sterilization of infectious waste or such like waste, with a liquid-tight and essentially germ-impermeable plastic member and a gas-permeable member for improvement of the safeguard against emergence of infectious organisms from the closed bag and for easy handling and subsequent unproblematic disposal after sterilization or disinfection, the two members are designed as separate bags (1, 2) which are nevertheless joined in such a way that the liquid-tight member forms the internal bag (2) inside the gas-permeable external bag (1) and is much less temperature-resistant than the external bag (1). It is advisable to provide the external bag with perforations and/or to give it a transparent design and to let the internal bag be coloured, so that it can be seen through the external bag.

<CLAIMS>
Dual sterilisation bag for infectious waste or the like, comprising a liquid-tight
section of synthetic material, which is essentially impermeable to germs, and a

gas-permeable section, which sections are connected to each other particularly
along a joining seam,
characterised in

that said two sections are configured as separate bags (1, 2) and are united in a
way that said liquid-tight section is disposed as interior bag (2) in said said gas-permeable

exterior bag (1) and is essentially less temperature-resistant than
said gas-permeable exterior bag (1) on the condition that said interior bag (2)

loses its mechanical strength during the sterilisation process to an extent that it
tears open.
Dual bag according to Claim 1,
characterised in

that said exterior bag (1) presents breakthroughs, particularly holes (4) or slits.
Dual bag according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in

that said exterior bag (1) is transparent.
Dual bag according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in

that said interior bag (2) is coloured. 
Dual bag according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in

that said interior bag (2) is heat-sealed, sewn or adhesively attached to said
exterior bag (1) along a joining seam (5).
Dual bag according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in

that said exterior bag (1) has a configuration longer than that of said interior
bag (2) and projects beyond the latter at the lower and upper edges.
Dual bag according to Claim 6,
characterised in

that said interior bag (2) is supported at a lower closure seam (3) of said exterior
bag (1).
Dual bag according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in

that the material of said interior bag (2) softens or fuses at a temperature between
60 and 135 °C.
Dual bag according to Claim 8,
characterised in

that said interior bag (2) consists of a polyethylene which softens or fuses at
temperatures as low as roughly 60 to 70 °C.
Dual bag according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in

that both said exterior bag (1) and said interior bag (2) consist of a chlorine-free
synthetic resin.
