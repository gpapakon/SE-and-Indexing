<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
polyetheramidoamine hydrogels, to processes for the 
preparation thereof and to the use thereof as 
superabsorbent materials. The commonly so called superabsorbent materials 
are hydrophilic polymers, having different chemical 
structure, which are capable of absorbing and retaining 
aqueous fluids even under moderate pressure in amounts 
equals to many time their own weight, without 
substantially dissolving into the liquid itself. Superabsorption characteristics are given by the 
presence, in the fundamental structure, of ionizable 
groups, which are generally of the anionic type 
(carboxylates) and are partially or totally salified; 
when in contact with water, said groups dissociate and 
solvatate. When dissociated, the functional groups along the 
polymeric chain have the same electric charge, 
therefore repel each other. This fact causes a widening of the polymeric 
lattice, therefore a further absorption of water 
molecules is possible. Generally, in order to avoid that such a process 
may lead to the dissolution of the polymer, this last 
is crosslinked by means of suitable agents as to make 
the gel substantially insoluble. Accordingly, the absorption of water allows a 
substantial swelling of the polymer only. Liquid absorption from polyelectrolytic  
 
superabsorbents is strongly adversed by the 
concentration of dissolved electrolytic salts. In fact, the ions, coming from the dissociation of 
the salts, interact with the global charge of the 
macroion of the polymer, thus reducing the repelling 
potential between its functional groups, consequently 
also the absorbing capacity will decrease. As a consequence, the absorbing capacity 
drastically decreases passing from deionized water to 
saline aqueous solutions. To date all the commercially available 
superabsorbent materials, such as for example 
polyacrylates, CMC, etc, show such a sensitivity to 
saline concentration (K. Nukushina; Chem.Abs. 94:66783 
e). Moreover, the gels of said superabsorbent polymers 
show the highest absorbing capacity when the pR of the 
aqueous solutions, which they are contacted with, is 
comprised between 8 and 10. Said absorbing capacity is strongly reduced in the 
pH range lower than 5, as it can be seen from Table A 
("Absorbency" by Pronoy Chatterjee, 1985, pag. 206).
