<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from raw materials of animal origin. The raw materials of animal origin are crushed and homogenised in a nitrate salt solution, the homogenised material is treated at a high temperature with detergents and a concentrated sodium chloride solution, the reacted material is cooled, the cooled material is mixed with diatomite, the phases are separated by filtering and the end product is precipitated with ethyl alcohol. In order to improve the process so that it may be used on an industrial scale, ultrasound is applied for 10 to 80 minutes to the reacted material, before it is mixed with diatomite, the material being disposed in layers so that it may be uniformly and completely treated with ultrasound in predetermined conditions and at predetermined temperatures. The mixture ratio between the diatomite and the ultrasonically treated material equals 1:5 to 25 (weight in mg/volume in ml). The liquid phase separated by filtering is concentrated by pressure filtration and the precipitated DNA sodium salt is dried at 20 to 60  DEG C.
