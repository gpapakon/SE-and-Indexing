A liquid crystal display device and a method of 
driving the same comprising first and second XY-matrix 

liquid-crystal display panels provided with a switching 
device every pixel, and liquid crystal drives to supply 

video signals whose polarities are inverted every

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a head mount display using
two liquid-crystal panels, one for each eye of the user.Fig. 1 shows an example of a schematic configuration
of an XY-matrix display device using liquid crystal.
Referring to Fig. 1, a reference number 1 designates a
switching device comprising a field-effect transistor
(FET), 2 a liquid crystal cell and 3 a capacitor to hold
signal charges. Reference numbers 4R, 4G and 4B designate
a switching device comprising a FET respectively, 5 a
shift register and 6 an input terminal for pulses to
drive the above-described shift register 5. A reference
number 7 designates a shift register, 8 an input terminal
for pulses to drive the above-described shift register
7, and 9R, 9G and 9B an input terminal for a video signal
for a primary color of R, G or B respectively. A
reference number 10 designates a common electrode for 
liquid crystal cells, 11 a gate conductor and 12 a
vertical signal conductor.An operation of the above-described liquid crystal
display will be described referring to Fig. 1. When a
clock pulse of the frequency m times (m: the number of
pixels in the horizontal direction of the liquid
crystal display (LCD)) as many as a horizontal
frequency is input through the input terminal 6 to the
shift register 5, the m-row shift register 5 is driven
by this drive pulse in order to supply a pulse output
from the shift register 5 to each gate of switching
devices 4R, 4G and 4B and to turn on switches 4R, 4G
and 4B. Video signals R, G and B input through the
input terminal 9 (9R, 9G and 9B) are supplied to
vertical signal conductors 12 thereby. Each terminal
of switching devices 1 is connected to each vertical
signal conductor 12 and each another terminal of
switching devices 1 is connected to each liquid crystal
cell 2 and each capacitor 3. Further, when a clock
pulse of a horizontal frequency is input through the
input terminal 8 to the shift register 7, the n-row (n:
the number of pixels in the vertical direction of the
above-described LCD) shift register 7 is driven by this
drive pulse. As a result, a pulse output from the
shift register 7 is supplied through a predetermined
one of horizontal gate conductors 11 to each gate of
switching devices 1 and charges equivalent to potential 
difference between a signal supplied to the input
terminal 9 and voltage supplied to the common electrode
10 are held in each liquid crystal cell 2 and each
capacitor 3 when each switch 1 is turned on. At this
time, a predetermined voltage shall be supplied to the
common
