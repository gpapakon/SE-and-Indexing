<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to benz[b]azepine compounds useful in
the treatment of neurological disorders generally in mammals such as
man. More specifically, the compounds are useful in the treatment of
strokes and/or other neurodegenerative disorders such as hypoglycemia,
cerebral palsy, transient cerebral ischemic attack, perinatal
asphyxia, epilepsy, psychosis, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
Olivo-pontocerebellar atrophy, viral-induced neurodegeneration such as
in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and its associated dementia,
anoxia such as from drowning, spinal cord and brain trauma, poisoning
by exogenous neurotoxins, and chronic pain, for the prevention of drug
and alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and for the inhibition of tolerance
and dependence to opiate analgesics. The invention particularly
relates to novel benz[b]azepine compounds useful in reducing
neurological degeneration such as can be induced by a stroke and the
associated functional impairment which can result. Treatment using a
compound of the invention can be remedial or therapeutic as by
administering a compound following an ischemic event to mitigate the
effects of that event. Treatment can also be prophylactic or
prospective by administering a compound in anticipation that an
ischemic event may occur, for example in a patient who is prone to
stroke.It is known that ischemic events can trigger a dramatic
increase in extracellular concentrations of the excitatory amino acids
glutamate and aspartate which can, in turn, cause prolonged neuronal
excitation leading to a massive influx of calcium from extracellular
to intracellular sites in brain neural cells. A calcium overload can
thereby be created which leads to a cascade of events leading to cell
catabolism and eventually resulting in cell death. The N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor complex is believed to play a significant
role in the cascade of events leading to cell necrosis following an
ischemic event.The compounds provided by this invention may be useful in a
variety of neurodegenerative disorders because they function as 
excitatory amino acid antagonists. They may do so indirectly, via
allosteric modulation of the glutamate binding site, specifically by
acting as antagonists of the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor
on the NMDA receptor complex. They may also do so directly, by
binding to the glutamate site itself on the NMDA receptor complex.3-Amino-4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-benz[b]azepine is
disclosed
