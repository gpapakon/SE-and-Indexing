<ABSTRACT>
Air is inhaled from a high pressure supply via a demand 
valve 10, a main breathing chamber 20, and a mouthpiece 

30. Exhaled air passes through chamber 20, exhaust 
valve 40, and a secondary chamber 50, to exit via an 

exhaust port 60. A buoyancy jacket can be inflated from 
the high pressure supply via a first button-operated 

valve 70 and a flexible conduit 80. The jacket can also 
be inflated from mouthpiece 30 by depressing a second 

button 90 to sealably close port 60 and open a buoyancy 
valve 100 between chamber 50 and conduit 80. The non-return 

exhaust valve 40 allows air to flow in one 
direction from mouthpiece to jacket but prevents reverse 

flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to breathing apparatus for use by 
a scuba diver. GB 2 037 587-A and EP 0 278 598-A both disclose 
breathing apparatus which comprises: 
an inlet coupling for connection to a reservoir of 
compressed air; a buoyancy conduit for connection to a buoyancy 
device; a mouthpiece connected to a breathing chamber; and a demand valve for controlling the supply of air from 
the inlet coupling to the breathing chamber. In both cases the diver can inhale air from the jacket, 
which is considered to be a dangerous procedure. The present invention proposes that the apparatus has 
the features stated in the characterising part of Claim  
 
1. The following description and the accompanying drawing 
referred to therein are included by way of non-limiting 
example in order to illustrate how the invention may be 
put into practice. The drawing is a diagrammatic 
sectional view of scuba diving apparatus of the 
invention. The apparatus includes a valve body 1 provided with an 
inlet coupling 2 for connection via a quick-release 
device 3 and a high pressure hose 4 to a reservoir of 
compressed air (not shown). The coupling 2 communicates 
with a breathing chamber 20 via a spring-loaded demand 
valve 10. A mouthpiece 30 opens into the chamber 20, 
and a diaphragm 12 is sealably mounted in the wall of 
the chamber 20, exposed to external water pressure. The 
diaphragm is coupled to the demand valve 10 via a lever 
14 such that when the diver breathes in through the 
mouthpiece 30, the diaphragm moves inwards and opens the 
valve 10 via the lever 14 to admit air to the diver. When the diver exhales into the chamber 20 a one-way 
exhaust valve 40, which is biassed closed by a spring 
42, allows air to pass into a secondary chamber 50, from 
which it escapes via an exhaust port 60. The valve body 
1 is provided with a large-bore buoyancy conduit 66 for  
 
connection to a jacket or similar inflatable buoyancy 
device (not shown) via flexible hose 80. The conduit 66 
communicates with the secondary chamber 50 via a 
buoyancy valve 100 which is connected to a push rod 92. 
The rod 92 extends through the port 60 to carry a manual 
actuator button 90, which in turn contains a bias spring 
94 acting between the button and the valve body 1 to 
bias the buoyancy valve closed. The valve 100 thus prevents air from passing to or from 
the buoyancy conduit 66, but the jacket can be inflated 
for increased buoyancy by operating an inflate button 70 
to admit air from the inlet coupling 2 along a passage 
72 to the

Breathing apparatus for scuba diving, 
comprising: 


an inlet coupling (2) for connection to a reservoir of 
compressed air; 
a buoyancy conduit (66) for connection to a buoyancy 
device; 
a mouthpiece (30) connected to a breathing chamber 
(20); and 
a demand valve (10) for controlling the supply of air 
from the inlet coupling to the breathing chamber, 

   and characterised by: 
a secondary chamber (50) provided with an exhaust port 
(60) ; 
a buoyancy valve (100) arranged to control 
communication between the buoyancy conduit and the 

secondary chamber, said valve being biassed to a closed 
position; 
a one-way valve (40) arranged between the breathing 
chamber and the secondary chamber to allow exhaled air 

to pass from the mouthpiece into the secondary chamber 
but preventing air from passing in the opposite 

direction from the secondary chamber to the mouthpiece; 
and 
a manual actuator (90, 92) operable to close the 
exhaust port and open the buoyancy valve to connect the 

secondary chamber to the buoyancy conduit whereby the 
buoyancy device can be inflated by exhaled air. 
Breathing apparatus according to Claim 1, in 
which the manual actuator (90, 92) is further operable 

to connect the buoyancy conduit (66) with the exhaust 
port (60) to deflate the buoyancy device.
