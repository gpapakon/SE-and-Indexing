<ABSTRACT>
This high-voltage and high-frequency electrical device comprises at least one first electrical conductor (203) and at least one second electrical conductor (207), these conductors being held apart by at least one electrical insulation means (205), means (208) for applying a high-frequency high voltage between the first and the second conductor, and is characterised in that the insulation means (208) comprises at least one part having a cellular structure, the cellular structure being composed of cells (204) having walls (206) made of an electrically insulating material and containing a gas (202) which has a dielectric constant close to the dielectric constant of air.
