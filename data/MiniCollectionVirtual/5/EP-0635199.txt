<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to grippers (pincers, tongs, pliers) (200) with two legs (211, 212) and two handles (221, 222), in the case of which grippers the legs (211, 212) can be pivoted with respect to one another about a leg pivot point (S) and the handles (221, 222) can be pivoted with respect to one another about a separate handle pivot point which is located further back. In order to achieve a quasi-parallel position of the front leg ends in the end phase of their movement towards one another, the leg pivot point (S) is located behind the handle pivot point by a considerable distance, preferably at least a third of the overall length of the tool and, in an extreme case, the entire handle length. The invention is used wherever, in practice, virtual parallelism instead of precise parallelism suffices, e.g. in a large number of cases of cable-lug crimping.

<CLAIMS>
Pliers-type tool (100, 200), in particular a pair of 
crimping pliers with frontal input (P), and having two shanks or 

shank members (11, 12; 211, 212) which are pivoted one to another 
in a shank fulcrum (S), and the terminal portions of which are 

adapted to carry an operative menas (12b'), and with two handles 
or handle members (21, 22; 221, 222) which drive the shanks or 

shank members (11, 12; 211, 212) and are pivoted one to another 
in a handles fulcrum (H), each shank or shank member (11, 12; 

211, 212) having an extension (12a) extending beyond the handles 
fulcrum (H), and the first shank member (11, 211) being with the 

first handle member (21, 211) consolidated to a rigid tool body 
(20, 220) to which the second handle (22, 222) is pivoted in the 

handles fulcrum (H) which lies at a substantial distance (L''') 
away from the shanks fulcrum (S), so that the two shanks or shank 

members (11, 12; 211, 212) in the final phase of an approachment 
movement occupy a near-parallel position, a mechanism (30) being 

provided to transfer motion and force from the second handle (22, 
222) to the second shank or shank member, 
characterized by
 having 
two parallel and spaced (10, 210) tool body units (20', 20''; 

220', 220''), each of them comprising a tool body (20) embodied 
by a side plate, the operative means (12b') being together with 

at least one of the components: the second shank (12), the second 
handle (222), and the mechanism (30) for the transmission of force 

and motion located in a free space (10, 210) come about between 
the tool bodies (20', 20''; 220', 220'') due to the above said 

spacement (10, 210), in at least one of the tool body units being 
provided an opening (134c, 242') with such dimensions at right 

angles to the length direction of the tool body that a pin (43, 
242) anchored in the second handle (22, 222) may in all swing 

positions of the said handle unimpededly pass through the opening. 
The tool of claim 1 , 
characterized
 in said mechanism being 
defined by a pin (43) which directly connectes the second 

handle (22, 222) with the second shank or shank member (12). 
The tool of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 by being provided 
with a device for re-setting of the position of a shank or shank 

member (212).  
 
The tool of claim 3, 
characterized
 by a pin which passes 
through a shank or shank member, such as the pin (43) defining 

the said mechanism, having an excentrical centre portion (43'), 
and a fixing device (43a) being provided for fixing the rotational 

position of this pin. 
The tool of claim 3, 
characterized
 in the second shank 
(12) being in 
per se
 known manner divided in two parts (12a, 12b) 
by a longitudinal slot (12') which is open at one end, one (12b) 

of these parts being sprung and carrying the operative menas, and 
on the other part (12a) being located the point of attachment to 

the second handle (22). 
Tool according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
wherein each tool body unit consists of a single tool body, and 

the second shank (12) is disposed in said free space (10), 
characterized
 
by the second handle (22) being embodied by two side 

plates (22', 22'') arranged alongside the side plates which constitute 
the outer faces of the tool body. 
Tool according to one or more of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 by one of the openings (131a, 131b, 134a, 134b) 
through which the pin (42, 242) in the point of attachment (H) 

of the second handle (22, 222), and/or the pin (41) in the fulcrum 
(S) of the shanks passes, is longitudinal so as to allow, 

in all relative swing positions, unimpeded co-operation of the 
components: the second shank (12), the tool body (20), and the 

second handle (22). 
Tool according to one or more of the claims 1 to 5 with 
tool body units (220', 220'') which each has two tool bodies, and 

in which the second handle (222) and the mechanism for transmission 
of force and motion is located in the free space between the 

tool bodies, 
characterized
 in that in each tool body unit (220', 
220'') one tool body embodies the first shank member (211) and a 

rod-shaped extension (212'), and the second tool body embodies 
the second shank member (212) and a rod-shaped extension (212'), 

the extensions in both tool bodies of one tool body unit being 
at their free rear ends (211'a, 212'a) pivoted one to another 

with the aid of a pin (241) which embodies the shanks fulcrum 
(S), and all extensions in both tool body units defining the 

first handle (221) of the tool (200).  
 
The tool of claim 8, 
characterized
 by the said mechanism 
being embodiedby a so called flat ball-and-socket joint. 
Tool according to one or more of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 by the shanks or shank members being disposed so 
that the operative faces of the operative menas (12b', 16a) mounted 

in the first shank member and in the second shank or shank 
member extend exactly parallel when they are at a selected distance 

(A) which corresponds to an expected medium value of the 
size of the work pieces, being larger than zero and smaller than 

the maximum spacement of the shank members.
