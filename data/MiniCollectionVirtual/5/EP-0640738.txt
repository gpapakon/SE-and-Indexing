A door operating mechanism, preferably a door operating 
mechanism for cabinets, comprising a vertical pivot shaft 

(2) equipped with eccentric pins (5) at opposite ends 
thereof to cooperate with keeper members (3) 
characterized 
by
, that the vertical pivot shaft (2) is fixed by 
clamps (4) secured to the door at certain distances from 

the bottom and the top of the cabinet doors thereby permitting 
the elastic force occuring in the vertical pivot 

shaft (2) to be employed to close the door tightly 
against the sealing gasket on the cabinet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in door 
operating mechanisms, and especially door operating mechanisms 
for cabinets, comprising a vertical elastic pivot 
shaft equipped with eccentric pins at opposite ends 
thereof to cooperate with keeper members. A number of 
clamps which are secured to the door at a certain distance 
from the top and the bottom accomodate the vertical 
shaft. The fixing of the shaft by means of a number of 
clamps provides the vertical shaft with an elastic effect 
thereby ensuring optimal tightening of the door. Today it is known to use door operating mechanisms, especially 
for double hinged doors for refrigerator cars, 
where the operating mechanism comprises one vertical 
shaft with pins cooperating with keeper members at the 
top and at the bottom. The handle is horizontally secured 
to one door. In principle said door operating mechanism comprises two 
eccentric pins which cooperate with keeper members at the 
top and at the bottom. Said door operating mechanism is 
manufactured from up to approximately 30 individual components.  See for exampel according to US Patent no. 1 925 234, US Patent 
no. 1 952 112, US Patent no. 1 956 679, and US Patent no. 2 
297 007. None of the above mentioned door operating mechanisms are 
actuated by the elastic force occuring in the vertical 
shaft when secured to a number of clamps on the door. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
door operating mechanism which secures optimal tightening 
of cabinet doors, e.g. doors for laboratory cabinets, experimental 
animal cabinets, refrigerator cars, refrigerators, 
deep freezers, containers, industrial washing machines, 
and industrial automatic dishwashers. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
door operating mechanism consisting of as few individual 
parts as possible, and thereby reducing manufacturing 
costs for materials, moulding tools, mounting, etc. to a 
minimum. A further object of the present invention is to provide 
a door operating mechanism which can be easily cleaned by 
comprising only simple components in a limited number.  The objects of the invention are achieved by providing a 
door operating mechanism, and preferably a door operating 
mechanism comprising a vertical elastic pivot shaft 
equipped with two eccentric pins, as follows: A door operating mechanism, preferably a door operating 
mechanism for cabinets, comprising a vertical pivot shaft

<CLAIMS>
A door operating mechanism, preferably a door operating 
mechanism for cabinets, comprising a vertical 

pivot shaft (2) equipped with eccentric pins (5) at opposite 
ends thereof to cooperate with keeper members (3) 

characterized by, that the vertical pivot shaft (2) is 
fixed by clamps (4) secured to the door at certain distances 

from the bottom and the top of the cabinet doors 
thereby permitting the elastic force occuring in the vertical 

pivot shaft (2) to be employed to close the door 
tightly against the sealing gasket on the cabinet. 
A door operating mechanism as in claim 1 characterized 
by, that the door operating mechanism includes the following 

individual components: a vertical elastic pivot 
shaft including handle and eccentric pins (1); keeper 

members (3) at top and bottom; as well as a number of 
clamps (4) secured to the cabinet door for fixing of the 

vertical shaft (2). 
A door operating mechanism as in claim 1 characterized 
by, that the shaft (2) is fixed by one or more clamps 

(4). 
A door operating mechanism as in claim 1 characterized 
by, that the keeper members (3) are designed to operate two 

vertical shafts (2) equipped with eccentric pins (5) simultaneously, 
and that the keeper member is symmetrical, and that the 

same keeper member is applied in both the bottom and the top of 
the cabinet. 
A door operating mechanism as in claim 1 characterized 
by, that the keeper member (3) is designed to operate as 

a fender protecting the cabinet and the handle during for 
example transportation. 
Application of a door operating mechanism as in claim 
1 for cabinet doors for e.g. laboratory cabinets, experimental 

animal cabinets, refrigerator cars, containers, 
refrigerators, deep freezers, industrial washing machines 

and industrial automatic dishwashers.
