<ABSTRACT>
Device for arranging two tubular manufactured products in a predetermined position on corresponding twin supporting forms, comprising: - means for optically detecting the end having the elastic edge (10, 10') of each manufactured product (1, 1') slipped onto the respective supporting forms (2); - pushing means for aligning the ends having the edges (10, 10') of the manufactured products (1, 1') vertically relative to one another; - means for compressing and retaining the free end having the edge (10, 10') of each manufactured product (1, 1'); - means for alternately displacing in the longitudinal direction of the forms (2) the optical sensors (3, 3'), the pushers (5) and the cylinders (6) by means of a carriage (4) movable alternately in the abovementioned longitudinal direction.

Method for individually disposing two tubular
articles in a predetermined position on

corresponding paired support shapes, comprising a
preliminary step consisting in fitting the two

articles (1, 1') at random on a pair of coupled
horizontal and superimposed flat shapes (2),

characterized in that it includes, in succession,
the following further operating steps:


with the shapes (2) being open pushing the free
end provided with elastic hem (10) of the article

(1) which results fitted more deeply on the
respective shape (2) towards the tip (20) of the

latter, by acting, through push means (5), on the
outer edge of the elastic hem (10), in a direction

parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shapes
(2), so as to uncover and detect the inner end of

the elastic hem (10') of the other article (1') up
to a position of vertical alignment of the released

ends thereof, which position is determined, for
each article (1, 1'), by optical detection means

(3) associated to said push means (5);
interrupting the advancement of said push means
(5) just beyond the position of completion of

detection of the inner side od the last elastic hem 
(10') to be intercepted and detected;
reversing the motion of the articles (1, 1') -
pushing means and, upon interruption of the optical

contact with the inner side of each of said eastic
hems (10, 10'), compressing and holding the

corresponding articles (1, 1') at a position close
to its elastic hem (10, 10') to allow it to be

drawn towards the end of the shapes (2) which is
opposite to the tips, in a direction parallel to

the axis of the shapes (2) up to a predetermined
point on the latter;
closing the shapes (2), so as to prevent the
elastic return of the articles (1, 1') to a

position of misallignment of the respective elastic
hems (10, 10');
releasing the articles (1, 1') and leaving them
on the support shapes (2), with the thus positioned

and aligned free ends (10, 10').
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that upon completion of the step of drawing the

articles (1, 1') on the shapes (2), provision is
made for slightly pushing the elastic hems (10,

10') of the articles (1, 1') towards the tip (20)
of the shapes (2).
Apparatus for disposing two tubular articles 
in a predetermined position on corresponding paired

support shapes according to the method of claim 1
and comprising means for detecting the elastic hem

(10, 10') of each article (1, 1') fitted on the
respective support shapes (2), by means of two

vertically aligned optical sensors (3, 3') located
juxtaposed on opposite sides with respect to the

shapes (2), in correspondence of the vertical axial
plane thereof; means for compressing and retaining

the free end provided with elastic hem (10, 10') of
each article (1, 1') by means of two vertically

aligned operating cylinders (6) juxtaposed and
located on opposite sides with respect to the

shapes (2), each of which is provided with a pad
(60) connected to the free end of the stem thereof;

means for alternately moving the optical sensor (3,
3') and the cylinders (6) in either the directions

longitudinally to the shapes (2) by means of a
carriage (4) alternately movable in said

longitudinal direction and which comprises a frame
(40) with three horizontal brackets, that is to say

parallel to the shapes (2), and suitably spaced
apart in vertical direction, the two external ones

being on opposite sides with respect to the shapes
(2) and intended to support the said members (3) 

and (6) for the detection and respectively the
capture of the articles (1, 1') and the internal

one being at a position intermediate to the shapes
(2): said carriage (40) being located on the side

of the shapes (2) opposite to the tips (20)
thereof, characterized in that it comprises means

for vertically aligning with respect to each other
the free ends provided with elastic hem (10, 10')

of the articles (1, 1'), by means of two pairs of
juxtaposed pushers (5), that is to say arranged

orthogonally with respect to the axis of the shapes
(2), parallel to the corresponding sensors (3, 3')

and disposed on opposite sides with respect to the
shapes (2).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that each of said sensors (3, 3') is mounted in

a position behind the corresponding pushers (5)
with respect to the direction of advancement of the

carriage (4).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that each pair of pushers (5) is supported by a

corresponding bracket located externally to the
carriage (4).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that each of said sensors (3, 3') is mounted in 

a position before the corresponding pushers (5)
with respect to the direction of advancement of the

carirage (4).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that said pushers (5) are supported by the

central bracket of the carriage (4).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that said carriage (4) is provided with the

means for dissipating the elastic energy
accumulated by the articles (1, 1') during their

positioning, with two laminae (41) which cooperate
with the pads (60) of the cylinders (6) and whose

free ends, during said positioning, are in contact
with the elastic hem (10, 10') of the articles (1,

1') so as to prevent them from elastically moving
back to a misallignment position upon their

release.
