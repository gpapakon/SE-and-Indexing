<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with government support under
grant number AI-22931, awarded by National Institutes of
Health. The Government has certain rights in the
invention.This invention relates to antimicrobial peptides and,
more specifically, to cryptdin peptides and their uses.Survival in a world teaming with microorganisms depends
on a network of host defense mechanisms. Among these
mechanisms are phagocytosis in which cells which circulate
in the blood system, ingest and digest potentially harmful
microbes. Although pathogenic microbes may vary
considerably, phagocytes are able to destroy the vast
majority by sequestering them in intracytoplasmic vacuoles
and exposing them to a lethal mixture of organic and
inorganic toxins.Perhaps the most remarkable ultrastructural feature of
phagocytes are their several thousand cytoplasmic granules,
which are membrane-bound organelles typically about 0.3 Âµm
in diameter. During phagocytosis, some of these granules
fuse to phagocytic vesicles thus enabling the contents of
the granule to enter the lumen of the vesicle. Early
observers surmised correctly that the granules contained
factors which were responsible for intraphagosomal killing
in digestion of microbes. These granules contain a mixture
of antimicrobial molecules including various peptides such
as the so-called defensins.Defensins are abundant antimicrobial peptide components
of vertebrate neutrophil and macrophage granules. Members
of the defensin family have been identified previously in
human, rabbit, guinea pig, and rat phagocytes, primarily
those phagocytes termed phagocytic granulocytes. Defensins
are cationic peptides, generally between 3 and 4 kD in size 
which exhibit broad-range antimicrobial activities against
gram negative and gram positive bacteria, many fungi, and
some enveloped viruses. The peptides are characterized by
eight invariant amino acids including six invariant
cysteine residues which constitute a unique disulfide
motif. The three disulfides stabilize a tertiary
conformation consisting predominantly of beta-sheet. The
highly ordered structure and the absence of helix make
defensins unique among known antimicrobial peptides. It
appears that defensins exert their antibacterial effect by
permeabilizing the cytoplasmic membrane of the target
microorganism by a mechanism that may involve the formation
of ion channels.Until recently, defensins had been identified only from
circulating or tissue phagocytes of myeloid origin.
However, it has been surmised that similar peptides might
be
