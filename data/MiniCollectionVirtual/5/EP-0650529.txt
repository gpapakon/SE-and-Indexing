<ABSTRACT>
Water-dispersible and/or water-emulsifiable urethane oligomers haing a fatty character (UR fatty oligomers) contain hydrocarbon fatty residues, the oligomer molecule having an at least mostly non-cross-linked base structure, together with acid groups capable of building salts. These oligomers are used as amphiphilic agents for greasing and if desired retanning leathers and pelts. Also disclosed are aqueous dispersions of said amphiphilic UR fatty oligomers designed as water-dilutable, aqueous pasty masses. These dispersions may also contain emulsifiers and if desired other greasing or water-proofing agents known per se for leathers and pelts, mixed with the UR fatty oligomers.

<CLAIMS>
The use of water-dispersible and/or water-emulsifiable 
urethane oligomers of fatty character (UR fatty 

oligomers) containing hydrocarbon fatty groups together 
with acid groups capable of salt formation in an at least 

predominantly uncrosslinked basic structure of the oligomer 
molecule for the oiling and, optionally, retanning of 

leather and skins. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the UR fatty oligomers contain hydrocarbon fatty groups 

with 8 to 40 and preferably 12 to 32 carbon atoms which 
are preferably derived from corresponding fatty acids 

and/or fatty alcohols, may be linear and/or branched and 
may even be mono- and/or polyolefinically unsaturated. 
The use claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the UR fatty oligomers contain carboxylic acid 

and/or sulfonic acid groups which may be present as such 
or even in the form of their water dissociable salts. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the UR fatty oligomers contain on average a plurality 

of acid groups and preferably a plurality of hydrocarbon 
fatty groups per oligomer molecule. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the UR fatty oligomers are derived from aliphatic, 

cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic diisocyanates and diols 
containing acid groups and/or fatty groups and, if 

desired, monohydric alcohols which may also contain fatty 
and/or acid groups. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the anionically modified oligourethanes of fatty 

character are reaction products of diisocyanates with 

(a) mixtures of diols containing acid groups, more 
particularly carboxylic acid groups, and monohydric 

fatty alcohols or  
 
(b) mixtures of diols containing fatty groups and 
hydroxycarboxylic acids containing one or more 

hydroxyl and/or carboxylic acid groups. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the UR fatty oligomers have been produced using 

partial esters of trihydric and/or higher alcohols with 
long-chain fatty acids, for example corresponding monoglycerides 

or fatty acid alkanolamides, and hydroxyfunctional 
mono- and/or polycarboxylic acids, such as glycolic 

acid, lactic acid, hydroxybutyric acid, malic acid, 
citric acid, or using carboxyfunctional diols, such as 

dimethylol propionic acid and/or tartaric acid, and fatty 
alcohols. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that UR fatty oligomers with average molecular weights of 

500 to 30,000 g/mole and preferably in the range from 
about 1,000 to 15,000 g/mole are used, the use of UR 

fatty oligomers with low molecular weights in the range 
from about 1,000 to 4,000 g/mole being particularly 

preferable. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that the UR fatty oligomers are used in the form of 

aqueous dispersions and/or emulsions which have preferably 
been adjusted to a mildly acidic to mildly alkaline pH 

value. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the amphiphilic UR fatty oligomers are used together 

with emulsifiers which, on introduction into - in particular 
- mineral-tanned leather and/or skins, have an 

additional oiling effect and, at the same time, can be 
fixed in the tanned leather or skin via acidic groups. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 10, characterized in 
that, after introduction into the leather and/or skins to 

be oiled, the UR fatty oligomers are fixed therein by an  
 

aftertreatment, more particularly with mineral tanning 
agents.
