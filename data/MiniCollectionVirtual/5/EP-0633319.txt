<ABSTRACT>
An optically active 1,3-butanediol can be produced by 
treating 4-hydroxy-2-butanone with a microorganism, which 

has been optionally treated, capable of asymmetrically 
reducing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, and collecting optically 

active 1,3-butanediol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing optically active 1,3-butanediol with a
microorganism.Optically active 1,3-butanediol is an important
starting material for various medicines such as
antibiotics.Known processes for producing optically active
1,3-butanediol include (1) a process wherein a
chemically synthesized mixture of 1,3-butanediol
racemates is optically resolved with an optical
resolving agent (cf. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
191631/1986, (2) a process wherein it is produced
from 4-hydroxy-2-butanone by asymmetric synthesis
with a Raney nickel catalyst treated with an optically
active compound [cf. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
204187/1983 and Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 53, 1356 to
1360 (1980)] and (3) a process of asymmetrically reducing
4-hydroxy-2-butanone to yield R-1,3-butanediol using baker's
yeast [cf.J.Biol. Chem 94, 1931, 361-366. However, the
processes (1) and (2) have a defect that expensive optical
resolving agent and catalyst must be used and, in addition, 
the product obtained by the process (2) has a low
optical purity. The yield of the process of (3) is not
satisfactory. Under these circumstances, it is
demanded to establish a process for producing
optically active 1,3-butanediol having a high optical
purity in an economically advantageous and convenient
manner. This object has been achieved with a
process for producing optically active 1,3-butanediol by asymmetrically reducing
4-hydroxy-2-butanone into either (R)-1,3-butanediol or (S)-1,3-butanediol by means
of a microorganism, which has been optionally treated and collecting the
(R)-1,3-butanediol or (S)-1,3-butanediol thus formed
wherein the microorganisms forming (R)-1,3-butanediol are selected from the
genera Ambrosiozyma, Bacillus, Candida, Citrobacter, Corynebacterium, Hansenula,
Issatchenkia, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Protaminobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhodotorula,
Selenotila, Schizosaccharomyces, Stephanoascus and Xanthomonas and
wherein the microorganisms forming (S)-1,3-butanediol are selected from the genera
Brevibacterium, Candida, Geotrichum, Klebsiella, Lodderomyces,
Saccharomycopsis and Trichosporon. After intensive investigations made for the
purpose of getting a microorganism usable for producing
optically active 1,3-butanediol having a high optical
purity by asymmetric reduction, the inventors have
found that a microorganism selected from among those
belonging to the genera Ambrosiozyma, Bacillus,
Candida, Citrobacter, Corynebacterium, Hansenula,
Issatchenkia, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Protaminobacter,
