<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of carboxylic acids having ether groups, by means of a catalytically accelerated addition reaction of alcoholic hydroxyl groups of mono- or polyhydric alcohols with tert-alkyl esters or  alpha ,ss-unsaturated carboxylic acids, followed by acidic hydrolysis of the resulting tert-alkyl ss-ether carboxylates.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing carboxylic acids which contain 
ether groups, of the formula 


 
characterised in that, in a first process step, 1 mole 

of an alcohol of the formula 

Q(OH)
x+y
 
is reacted with at least x moles of tert-alkyl esters 

of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids of the formula 

 
in an addition reaction at 0 to 100°C, in the presence 

of catalysts which accelerate the addition of 
alcoholic hydroxyl groups to α,β-unsaturated 

carboxylic acid derivatives, and then, in a second 
reaction step, the tert.-alkyl ester obtained in this 

way is hydrolysed in the presence of acids to give the 
corresponding β-ethercarboxylic acids, wherein, in the 

formulas mentioned, 

Q
represents a radical such as is obtained by 
removing the hydroxyl groups from a (x+y)-hydric 

alcohol with a molecular weight in 
the range 32 to 6000,  

 
R' and R''
represent identical or different radicals 
and hydrogen or a methyl group, wherein at 

least one of the radicals is hydrogen, 
R'''
represents a tert.-alkyl radical, 
x
represents a number from 1 to 6, and 
y
represents a number from 0 to 5, wherein the 
sum x + y has a value from 1 to 6. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
tert.-butyl acrylate or tert.-butyl methacrylate is 

used as a tert.-alkyl ester of an α,β-unsaturated 
carboxylic acid. 
A process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that polyetherdiols or -triols with a molecular 

weight in the range 300 to 6000 or mixtures of this 
type of polyetherpolyol are used as polyhydric 

alcohols of the formula 

Q(OH)
x+y
.
A process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or 

potassium tert.-butanolate is used as a catalyst for 
the addition reaction between unsaturated carboxylates 

and alcohols.
