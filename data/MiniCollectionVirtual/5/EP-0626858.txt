<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the inhibition of viral
proliferation with human-type serum serine protease inhibitors.
More specifically, the invention provides the prevention or
inhibition of viral replication and in some instances a direct
kill of the viruses through the use of human-type serine protease
inhibitors, their analogs, salts, conjugates or derivatives. The
viral replication is inhibited in mammals and plants and involves
viruses with a DNA genome or a RNA genome.Infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or
protozoa, encode or carry their own crucial enzymes and nucleic
acids which are obvious targets for intervention.The viruses can be generally classified as being single
stranded or double stranded. All viruses with a DNA genome
except Pavoviridae are double stranded. Those viruses having RNA
genomes are single or double stranded.As a matter of convention, the nucleotide sequences found
in viral messenger RNAs during replication are designated as
having positive polarities. This allows RNA viruses to be
classified as: 1) negative-stranded (- polarity) viruses, if
they have genomes with nucleotide sequences complementary to
those present in mRNAs; 2) positive-stranded (+ polarity)
viruses, if they have genomes with identical sequences to mRNA;
and 3) double-stranded RNA viruses, if they have RNA strands of
both polarities. In addition to the polarity differences between
viral RNA genomes, these viruses can be distinguished based on 
the segmentation of viral RNA.The polarity of the RNA genome helps determine the mechanism
of viral replication. Genomes of RNA viruses having single
stranded RNAs of plus polarity are directly translated during the
initial stages of infection by cell macromolecules without
requiring the synthesis of specific viral transcriptases and
other viral enzymes necessary for mRNA formation. Negative- and
double-stranded viruses, however, require that transcription of
mRNA from genome RNA occurs before translation can be initiated.
Since normal cells lack an enzyme that transcribes RNA templates
into complementary RNA strands, these viruses must encode the
appropriate enzyme(s) during their replication cycle.
Furthermore, the enzyme must be incorporated into progeny virus
in order to initiate transcription and replication during
successive infections.The life cycle of retroviruses requires a specific protease
that processes the precursor "gag" and "pol" polyproteins into
mature virion components. If the protease is absent or inactive,
non-infectious virus
