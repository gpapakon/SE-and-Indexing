<ABSTRACT>
A cigarette smoking article (10) includes a tobacco rod (12) and 
a dual filter (18) comprising a tobacco rod end segment (22) made of 

cellulose acetate tow and a mouth end segment (24) made of a 
gathered, perforated polymeric film blended with a whitener 

to produce a substantially non-staining mouth end surface (32). 
The polymeric film (70) may also comprise a coextruded flavor film 

with a flavor carrier layer (72) disposed between a pair of 
barrier layers (74,76) for releasing a flavorant into the mainstream 

smoke during smoking of the cigarette. Transparent wraps (50,56,58,60) 
may be used to construct the cigarette from the component parts 

so that the filtration surfaces of the filter rod are visible 
through the wraps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to smoking article 
filters and more particularly to cigarette filters which 
provide visual cues to encourage the smoker's favorable 
perception of the cigarette filter and/or the effectiveness 
of the filter and which are provided with flavorant additives 
releasable during smoking of the cigarette. Conventional filter cigarettes typically include a 
filter made of a cellulose acetate tow which becomes stained 
at the mouth end of the filter as the cigarette is smoked. 
Some smokers consider this stain to be objectionable 
notwithstanding the fact that the stain is a visual indicator 
that the filter is operating efficiently and effectively. 
There have been attempts to eliminate this stain or at least 
minimize the smoker's perception of the stain both visually 
and from a taste standpoint, for example, by the provision of 
a recess at the mouth end of the filter. However, many 
smokers consider the recessed-end filter also to be 
objectionable regardless of its effectiveness in eliminating 
or reducing the visual or taste perception of the stain at 
the mouth end of the filter. It would be desirable therefore to provide a filter for 
a smoking article, such as a cigarette, in which the mouth 
end of the filter exhibits little or no staining during 
smoking. At the same time, such filter should provide  
 
filtration effectiveness equivalent or substantially 
equivalent to the conventional cellulose acetate filters. It is well known to enhance or alter the taste or 
flavor of cigarettes providing the tobacco and/or filter of 
the cigarette with a flavorant additive. One problem 
associated with the addition of flavorants to cigarettes and 
cigarette filters is the migration of the flavorant from the 
cigarette or filter to the cigarette packaging material or to 
the surroundings when the cigarette package is opened. It 
would be desirable to incorporate a flavorant additive in a 
cigarette in such a way that migration of the flavorant prior 
to smoking the cigarette is minimized but that upon lighting 
and smoking the cigarette, release of the flavorant additive 
is accelerated so that it is readily perceived by the smoker. The present invention is directed to a smoking article 
filter that provides equivalent or substantially equivalent 
filtration as the prior art cigarette filters, but visually 
exhibits a relatively clean mouth end during smoking and thus 
avoids the heavy staining at the mouth end of the filter in 
prior art cigarettes that some smokers find

<CLAIMS>
A smoking article having a longitudinal axis and 
comprising a rod of smoking material and a filter rod 

attached to said rod of smoking material, said filter rod 
including a mouth end segment made of a sheet of polymeric 

film gathered to form a plurality of folds in said film, said 
folds having folded edges extending substantially parallel to 

the longitudinal axis of the smoking article, said mouth end 
segment having a mouth end surface formed by a transverse 

edge of said sheet of film. 
The smoking article of claim 1, wherein said 
polymeric film is blended with a whitener to produce a white 

mouth end surface. 
The smoking article of claim 2, wherein said 
whitener is calcium carbonate. 
The smoking article of claim 1, wherein said 
polymeric film has a plurality of perforations. 
The smoking article of claim 1, wherein said 
smoking material is tobacco and said smoking article is a 

cigarette. 
The smoking article of claim 5, wherein said 
filter rod further includes a tobacco rod end segment 

comprising a cellulose acetate tow. 
The smoking article of claim 1, wherein said 
polymeric film is a polyethylene film blended with a calcium 

carbonate whitener, said film having a plurality of 
perforations. 
The smoking article of claim 1, wherein said 
polymeric film is a multiple layer flavor film comprising a 

polymeric flavor carrier layer containing a releasable 
flavorant and being disposed between a pair of polymeric 

barrier layers for retaining the flavorant in the flavor 
carrier layer, said flavorant being releasable into mainstream 

smoke during smoking.
