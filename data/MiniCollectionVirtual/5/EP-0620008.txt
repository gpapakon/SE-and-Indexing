<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions for the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, comprising as an active component
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or analogues, derivatives and fragments
thereof.Neurodegenerative diseases in which neuronal cells degenerate
bring about a deterioration of cognitive functions. A variety of diseases and
neurological deficiencies may bring about the degeneration of neuronal cells
among them Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease or chorea, hypoxia or
ischemia caused by stroke, cell death caused by epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, mental retardation etc., as well as neurodegenerative changes
resulting from aging.Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28 amino acid
regulatory peptide which exhibits neurotransmitter and hormonal roles. VIP
has a discrete distribution in the central nervous system (CNS), with highest
levels in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala and corpus striatum. 
Accumulated evidence suggest the involvement of VIP in a multitude of
neuronal functions among them: changes in membrane potential, modulation
of muscarinic excitation, promotion of survival of electrically blocked
neurons(1), maintenance of neural integrity(2), development of neonatal
behavior in rats(3), rescue from neural death caused by HIV envelope protein.
A VIP-receptor antagonist caused spatial learning impairment in rats which
was attenuated by co-treatment with VIP, indicating a possible role for VIP
in the process of learning(4).There is conflicting evidence concerning the role of VIP in
dementia in general and in Alzheimer's disease in particular. A large body
of evidence suggests no such involvement. Rosor et al. found no changes
in VIP in cerebral cortex of brains obtained from patients suffering from
senile dementia of the Alzheimer types as compared to controls(5). Other
investigators found no variance in VIP measurement between Alzheimer's
patients and controls(6,7,8) and no correlation was found between the degree
of dementia and the concentration of VIP in the cerebrospinal fluid(9).In contrast, a study of immunoreactivity of VIP in Alzheimer's
and control brains showed a significant reduction of VIP immunoreactivity
in the cerebral cortex especially in the insular and angulate cortex of
Alzheimer's patients(10). However, it has never been determined whether this
reduction was the cause or rather the result of the Alzheimer's deterioration
of the cerebral cortex.According to the present invention it has been found that VIP
