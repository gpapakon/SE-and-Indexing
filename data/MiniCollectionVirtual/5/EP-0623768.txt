<ABSTRACT>
A labyrinth ring seal (10) is sized to fit within a 
cavity (16) to seal against a rotatable shaft (11) to 

control excessive leakage of gas between high and low 
pressure chambers (13, 14) such as in a turbo machine. 

The seal (10) is comprised of an elastomeric ring-shaped 
body with spaced opposing high and low pressure walls (25, 

26) and a labyrinth seal surface (17) extending 
therebetween for sealing with the shaft (11). The walls 

have portions defining opposing surfaces of unequal area 
for pressure-balancing against each other within the 

cavity (16) with a controlled gas flow clearance between 
walls of the cavity (16) so that the seal is substantially 

free to float with vibration of the shaft (11) while 
maintaining close tolerance sealing between the labyrinth 

surface and the shaft (11) as the latter rotates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a seal and
seal assembly for sealing against a rotatable shaft.
In particular, the invention is concerned with a
labyrinth type seal such as may be used to seal against
the leakage of gas between high and low pressure areas
in a compressible fluid turbo machine.In a compressible fluid turbo machine such as a
high speed centrifugal compressor, it is important to
the efficiency of the machine that leakage of
compressed gas between high and low pressure areas be
kept as low as possible. This is particularly true
along the rotatable shaft carrying the compressor
impeller where the shaft extends through a support in
the housing from an area of high pressure to an area of
low pressure. One prior arrangement has been to
utilize a fixed labyrinth seal assembly to seal between
the housing and the shaft in the areas between high and
low pressure. With such an arrangement, an annular
seal body is mounted within an annular cavity in the
housing. The impeller shaft extends through the seal
body with a labyrinth portion of the body acting
between the shaft and a sealing surface on the shaft to
keep high pressure gas from leaking along the shaft
into the low pressure area. As operating conditions of
the compressor create higher pressure differentials
between high and low pressure areas and the rotational
speed of the shaft increases, closer tolerances are 
required between the labyrinth and shaft seal surfaces
in order to keep leakage within acceptable limits.
However, a problem is encountered as closer tolerances
are required in that vibration of the shaft as it
rotates may exceed tolerance clearances, causing the
shaft to wear against the seal and premature failure of
the seal. GB-A-1,387,009 discloses a rotary shaft seal
comprising a sealing bush having a first section which with
the shaft defines a cylindrical seal gap for the flow
therethrough of a barrier fluid and a second section
constructed to co-operate with the shaft to form during
rotation of the shaft a plurality of hydrodynamic, radial
load-bearing wedge-shaped films of fluid circumferentially
spaced around the section, and an annular resilient element
surrounding the bush and supporting the bush in radial
directions.CH-A-532,215 discloses a gas seal according to the
preamble of claim 1. The present invention is
characterised by the features of the characterising portion
of claim 1. In general, the present invention contemplates a
labyrinth seal and assembly constructed in a novel
configuration to more efficiently seal
