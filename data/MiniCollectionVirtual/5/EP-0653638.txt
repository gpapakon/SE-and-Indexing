<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxidizing
composition (or oxidant composition) in the form of
powder, which is applicable to a chemiluminescence
reaction (or chemical reaction for emitting
chemiluminescence) of a chemiluminescent substance (or
chemiluminescence-emitting substrate), and to a method
of measuring chemiluminescence by using the oxidizing
composition. The oxidizing composition and the
measurement method according to the present invention
are particularly suitable for qualitative or
quantitative analysis of a biological substance and/or
another minor (or trace) substance.Chemiluminescence is luminescence as a result of
a chemical reaction. A chemiluminescence course or
process generally includes a step in which molecules
are excited in a chemical reaction to be converted
into an excited state via a transition state, and the
molecules are then caused to emit light while they are
returned to the ground state.The fluorometry (i.e., analytical method 
utilizing fluorescence), which is one of typical high-sensitivity
analytical methods for measuring
substances, requires a light source (or excitation
source) such as xenon lamp for exciting fluorescent
molecules. Accordingly, in a case where the
fluorometry is applied to high-sensitivity analysis,
the background level in the measurement is liable to
be elevated because of a stray light phenomenon due to
the light source and of Raman effect (or Raman light)
due to a solvent to be used in the measurement.
Further, the background level in this analysis is
liable to vary due to fluctuation in the light emitted
from the light source. Consequently, when the
sensitivity of a detector to be used for the
fluorometry is simply enhanced in the fluorometry, the
noise level in the measurement is also elevated along
with an increase in the signal level.On the other hand, high-sensitivity analysis on
the basis of chemiluminescence (hereinafter called
'chemiluminescence analysis') has been focused in
recent years. In the chemiluminescence analysis,
since chemiluminescent molecules are excited on the
basis of a chemical reaction (or chemical energy), 
additional light source as an excitation source is
not required. Thus, the chemiluminescence analysis
has an advantage such that the sensitivity of a
detector to be used therefor may be increased without
consideration of the above-mentioned effect of a light
source on the measurement. In addition, the
chemiluminescence analysis also has other advantages
such that it has a wide dynamic range, it can use a
relatively
