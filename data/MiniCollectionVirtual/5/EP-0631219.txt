<ABSTRACT>
There are living rooms or work rooms which are only used from time to time but in which, in the course of time, a certain rhythm of use is set. Regulation in accordance with a rigid time plan would represent a waste of energy and, at certain times, would not correspond to the requirements arising. In contrast, the control, known per se, using presence detectors would not offer sufficient convenience, since no predictive intervention is possible. The spirit of the invention is to take into account constant habits of the occupants and, nevertheless, to achieve a maximum in terms of energy-saving with optimum convenience. This is achieved in that a set time plan is adapted to the regularities of the use of the rooms which arise, using the presence times, recorded by means of presence detectors, on the following days, in accordance with a fuzzy algorithm.
