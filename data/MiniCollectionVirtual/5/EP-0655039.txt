<ABSTRACT>
In order to optimize the relationship between the forces which occur in the operation of a vacuum-brake braking-force amplifier, in particular the response and return forces, the invention calls for means (36, 33, 17) to be provided which enable the obturator element (10) of a control valve (12) which controls the difference between an underpressure and the atmospheric pressure to be acted on by the pressure acting in the air-supplied working chamber (3) on its side (12) remote from the control-valve seal seats (15, 16).

A vacuum brake power booster for automotive vehicles
including a booster housing (1) having its interior

subdivided by a movable wall (2) into a vacuum chamber (4)
and a working chamber (3), as well as a control valve (12)

which controls a pressure differential acting on the
movable wall (2) and is arranged in a control housing (5)

that carries the movable wall (2), said control valve
comprising two concentrically arranged sealing seats

(15,16) and an elastically deformable valve member (10),
characterized in that
 the valve member (10)
confines a pneumatic chamber (17) in the control housing

(5), said chamber being arranged on the side of the valve
member (10) remote from a sealing surface (42) of the valve

member (10) that cooperates with the sealing seats (15,
16), and said chamber being adapted to be acted upon by the

pneumatic pressure prevailing in the working chamber (3),
and 
in that
 the connection between the pneumatic chamber
(17) and the working chamber (3) is provided by at least

one passage (19) arranged proximate the sealing surface
(42) of the valve member (10).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the passage(s) (19
provide(s) a connection between an annular chamber (24),

confined by the sealing seats (15, 16) and connected to the
working chamber (3), and the pneumatic chamber (17). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 1 or claim
2,
characterized in that
 the control valve (12)
in the control housing (5) is arranged in an area which is

radially bounded by a sliding packing ring (13) which
guides and seals the control housing (5) in the booster

housing (1).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 the valve member (10)
has a radially external and a radially internal rolling

fold (25, 30) which, along with its sealing surface (42)
and a retaining ring (21) retaining the valve member (10)

in the control housing (5), confine the pneumatic chamber
(17).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 the valve member (10)
has an annular shape and a radially external and a radially

internal sealing lip (31, 32) which, along with its sealing
surface and a guide element (34) arranged and sealed in the

control housing (5), confine the pneumatic chamber (17).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 4 or claim
5,
characterized in that
 an annular reinforcing
element (35) is arranged on the side of the valve member

(10) remote from the sealing seats (15, 16), and a valve
spring (22) bears against the reinforcing element (35) and

biasses the valve member (10) in the direction of the
sealing seats (15, 16). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 6,
characterized in that
 the reinforcing element
(35) has a U-shaped cross-section and includes at least one

opening (20 or 33, respectively) opposite to the passage
(19 or 36, respectively) of the valve member (10).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claims 4, 6 and
7,
characterized in that
 the annular reinforcing
element (35) is positioned between the rolling folds (25,

30).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 8,
characterized in that
 the reinforcing element
(35) has an L-shaped cross-section.
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 4 or claim
8,
characterized in that
 the pneumatic chamber
(17) is sealed by sealing beads (38, 39), which are

respectively adjacent to the external and the internal
rolling folds (25 and 30) and in sealing abutment on the

control housing (5) or the retaining ring (21),
respectively.
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims 4 or 8 to 10,
characterized in that
 the diameter of the
radially internal rolling fold (30) is smaller than the

diameter of the second sealing seat (16), or that it is at
most as large as the diameter of the second sealing seat. 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims 2 to 11,
characterized in that
, when the control valve
(12) is actuated, the working chamber (3) is connected to

the atmosphere by way of a pneumatic channel (29) which
terminates into the annular chamber (24).
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 12,
characterized in that
 the channel (29)
extends roughly radially in the control housing (5) in the

actuating direction behind the control valve (12).
