<ABSTRACT>
A device for the lubrication of the internal members of a smoothing head (10) for 
stone material manufactures is described. It comprises a box-like sealed body rotated 

by the shaft of a driving motor entering thereinto and transmitting the driving 
movement, through said members to abrasive blocks (28, 40) fitted outside said body, 

which is comprised of a casing (14) rotated by the driving motor and is upside 
sealed by a fixed cover (16) crossed by the shaft of the driving motor. The 

lubrication device comprises a pair of symmetrically opposed ducts (32) connected 
through a first open end (32a) to a passage (34), communicating with the inside of 

the casing (14), crossing the fixed cover (16) in a central area. The ducts (32) 
extend firstly in radial direction into the casing (14) till the contour of a transversal 

diametral plane thereof, then are bent and continue in a final portion thereof (32c) 
extending in accordance with a direction substantially tangential to the contour of the 

casing (14) and end with the other open end (32d). A flange (17) between the inside 
of the casing (14) and the fixed cover (16) is provided for limiting the level of the 

lubricant contained in the casing (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a smoothing and
polishing head for the manufacture of stone and/or ceramic materials, as for
example panels, tiles and the like.Smoothing and/or polishing heads for the manufacture of stone and/or ceramic materials
are well known and it
is also well known that they consist of a sealed box-like body rotated by a shaft of a
driving motor entering thereinto and transmitting working power through internally
arranged transmitting mechanisms and gears to abrading blocks arranged outside said
body. The above mentioned heads, according to the shape of the used abrading
blocks and the kind of movement to them provided, are classified in two discrete
categories, i. e. swinging sectors and rotating rolls heads.In the present description both kinds of heads will be involved. Just for
shortening the disclosure and not to describe the different and many mechanisms
therein housed, which are extraneous with respect to the the inventive idea of the
present invention, consisting of a new lubricating device provided to them, references
will be made to an earlier Italian patent and to three earlier Italian patent
applications, as it will herebelow specified.As regards swinging sector heads the above mentioned reference relates to the
Italian Patent No. 1,175,191 in the name of Marcello Toncelli and the Italian Patent
Application S. N. VI 91A000065 in the name of Luca Toncelli, while for rotating rolls
heads reference will be made to DE-A1-4 209 273 and the Italian Patent Application
S. N. VI 92U000061 both in the name of Luca Toncelli.The above mentioned mechanisms and gears inside the head have, obviously, to
be lubricated for reducing the among them present frictions. The embodiment of
such a lubricating operation always involved serious problems for the manufacturers
mainly connected with the difficulties in obtaining a uniform and constant lubricant
distribution inside a rotating means.According to the prior art the lubrication has been carried out by grease
provided to said mechanisms and gears before closing the box-like body housing
them.The above mentioned approach did not, however, give very satisfying results
because, in operation, that is, when the head is rotating, the grease tends to migrate, 
owing to centrifugal action, to the peripheral mechanisms on which it accumulates to
the detriment of the lubricant quantity remaining among the central mechanisms,
resulting prone to an earlier wear. Such a problem is obviously emphasized by the
high rotation speed of the heads. Further,

Smoothing and polishing head (10) comprising a lubrication device
for the internal mechanisms and gears, the smoothing and polishing head (10)

for the manufacture of generally stone and/or ceramic materials such as slates, panels,
tiles and the like comprising a sealed box-like body (12) rotated by a

shaft (18) of a driving motor entering thereinto and transmitting working movement,
through said mechanisms and gears, to either swinging sectors (28) or rotating rolls

(40) of abrasive material fitted outside said box-like body (12), the latter
substantially comprising a casing (14) containing said operating members and gears

for the transmission of the movement which is rotated by said driving motor and is
sealed at the top by a fixed cover (16) crossed by said shaft (18) of the driving

motor, said head being 
characterized
 in that it comprises inside the upper part of the head (10) at least a pair of ducts (32)
symmetrically arranged one with respect to the other and with respect to a diametral

plane in which lies the rotation axis of the shaft (18) of the driving motor and
connected through an open end thereof (32a) to a passage (34) communicating with

the inside of said casing (14) embodied in said upper fixed cover (16) in a
substantially central area, said ducts (32) extending at first in a substantially radial

direction into said casing (14) at the contour of a diametral plane perpendicular to
the rotation axis of the driving motor shaft (18) and then bending and extending

in a final portion (32c) arranged according to a direction substantially tangential to
the contour of said casing (14) and ending with their open end (32d), further

the ducts (32) being arranged in opposed directions, so that when the
smoothing head (10), rotates in a direction just one duct (32) is active, while

the other duct (32) is active when the head (10) rotates in an opposed direction; and in that between

the inside of the casing (14) and the upper fixed cover (16) is interposed a flange (17),
extending to graze the internal wall of the casing (14), having the duty to limit and

maintain lowered the level of the lubricant pool, preventing any leakage thereof to
outside.
Head according to claim 1, characterized in that the end of the
passage (34) opposed to that connected to the open end (32a) of the ducts (32)

flows into the upper portion of the annular space (36) comprised between said shaft
(18) and the opening of the fixed cover (16) through which passes the shaft (18). 
Head according to claim 2, characterized in that the oil descends
from said annular space (36) to lubricate all the underlying mechanisms and gears

(30 and 38) on which is distributed by gravity and centrifugal force.
Head according to claim 3, characterized in that the oil flow among
the mechanism and gears (30, 38) is permitted by oil dripping thanks to operating

gaps existing among them and, therefore, the lubricant distribution occurs in
continuous and forced way owing to the same head given to the oil at the intake of

the duct (32) during the rotation of the smoothing head (10).
