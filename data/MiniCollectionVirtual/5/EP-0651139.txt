<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a turbo machine including a shroud (2) consisting of a plurality of shroud elements (2a, 2b,...) in the form of circular sectors each one bearing stationary vanes (4) on one internal face, and a circular casing (1) surrounding the shroud. It is characterised in that it includes a support ring (6) comprising a plurality of circular ring sectors (6a, 6b,...) each one fixed to the casing and having a U-shaped cross-section, the opening of which U points towards the shroud, each shroud element including fastening means (9a) capable of being inserted into the opening of at least one ring sector in order to secure the said ring sector and the shroud element together. Application to aircraft engines.

Turbomachine comprising:

a shroud (2) made up of a number of shroud

elements (2a, 2b, ...) in the form of circular sectors
each carrying stationary vanes (4) on an interior face;

and
a circular casing (1) surrounding the shroud,

characterized in that it comprises a support ring (6)
housed between the casing and the shroud, secured to

the said shroud and comprising a number of circular
ring sectors (6a, 6b,...) each fixed to the casing by

a fixed-point means (10) and at least two sliding-support
means (11) situated one on each side of the

fixed-point means so as to give the shroud
circumferential flexibility with respect to the casing.
Turbomachine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the ring sectors each have a

U-shaped section, the opening of which U faces towards
the shroud, and in that each shroud element comprises

attachment means (9a) capable of nesting into at least
one ring sector in order to secure the said ring sector

and the shroud element together.
Turbomachine according to Claim 2,
characterized in that, with each ring sector comprising

an upstream leg (8) and a downstream leg (7), each of
the said upstream and downstream legs comprises first

recesses (13) which are open radially towards the
shroud in order to give the said ring sector

circumferential flexibility. 
Turbomachine according to either one of Claims
2 and 3, characterized in that, with each ring sector

comprising an upstream leg (8) and a downstream leg (7)
the said upstream leg comprises second recesses (12).
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 2
to 4, characterized in that it comprises clamping means

(14, 15) resting on each side of each ring sector in
order to secure the said ring sector to the attachment

means of the shroud element.
Turbomachine according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the clamping means comprise a

screw (32) and a conical nut (34) introduced into the
ring sector and capable of moving away as the screw is

inserted, the base of the said nut then resting on the
internal faces of the ring sector.
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 3
to 6, characterized in that the attachment means of

each shroud element constitute, together with the ends
of the upstream and downstream legs of the ring sector

into which it is introduced, a dovetail-like assembly.
Turbomachine according to Claim 4,
characterized in that each fixed-point means comprises

a screw/nut system (16a, 16b) which secures a ring
sector to the casing without play, the nut being

introduced inside the ring through the second recess
and placed resting on an internal face of the web (20)

of the ring sector.
Turbomachine according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the screw is introduced into the

ring sector at an inclination of close to 45° with
respect to the radial direction.
Turbomachine according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the screw is introduced radially

into the ring sector and the nut has a conical shape,
the base of which faces towards the shroud.
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 2
to 10, characterized in that each sliding-support means

comprises: 

a screw (18a) surmounted by a projection (18b")
which is introduced into the ring sector through an

opening (21) made in the web of the said ring sector;
a soleplate (18b) surmounted by a projection
(18b") which is pierced with a hole which, on its wall,

has a screw thread for receiving the said screw and
which passes at least partially through the opening in

the web so as to be in contact with the casing;
two support pieces (19a, 19b) arranged one on
each side of the hole in the soleplate and fixed to the

ring sector in such a way as to allow the soleplate to
slide along the support pieces.
Turbomachine according to Claim 11,
characterized in that as the screw is introduced into

the ring sector with a longitudinal inclination of
angle α, the support pieces comprise a surface inclined

by an angle α with respect to the radial direction.
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 3
to 12, characterized in that the first recesses in the

downstream leg are closed by sealing plates (25).
Turbomachine according to Claim 13,
characterized in that the downstream leg of each ring

sector comprises, around the first recesses, slots (26)
in which the sealing plates are positioned and nested.
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 3
to 14, characterized in that each downstream leg of a

ring sector comprises, at one end, an extension tab
(22a) and, at another end, a complementary extension

tab (22b) allowing the said ring sector to nest into
the adjacent ring sectors with overlap.
