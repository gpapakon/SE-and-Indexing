<ABSTRACT>
A wheelchair in which running wheels (4), (4) are provided on the sides of the body of the chair supporting 
a seat (40), and in which partitions (5) that can be folded down outwardly are provided on the sides of the seat. The 

running wheels are located clear of the folding down partitions, or the wheels can be moved so that they make way 
for the folding down partitions. This wheelchair, as with a conventional one, can freely be run by an occupant who 

rotates the running wheels by his/her own efforts or an attendant who pushes it at the handle thereof, and when getting 
on and/or off the wheelchair, the occupant can open a side of the seat by folding down a partition so that he/she can 

get on and/or off it sideways in an easy posture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheelchair 
adapted for use by a physically handicapped or aged 
person. A wheelchair used by a physically handicapped or 
aged person is generally provided with handles for an 
attendant in the rear of the body, and armrests on the 
both sided of the sect, so that the wheelchair may be 
moved by manually turning the travelling wheels on the 
outside. A charging type motor driven wheelchair in 
which the travelling wheels are motor-driven. The seat 
in any of these wheelchairs is fixed facing front, and 
a backrest is provided on the back. The conventional wheelchair as described above had 
a wheel width not so wide and the rider got on and off 
from the front side, thus requiring the rider inevitably  
 
to move forward or back. The conventional wheelchair 
had therefore a problem in that it was very difficult 
and dangerous for a physically handicapped who was on a 
bed for most of his or her time to get on and off the 
wheelchair, requiring assistance of an attendant. The 
necessity of assistance of an attendant increases 
psychological burden on the rider and could cut down 
willingness to regain his or her health. The present invention has an object to enable a 
disabled person to get on and off a wheelchair by his 
or her own exertion as far as possible, and is 
therefore characterized in that, in a wheelchair 
provided with travelling wheels on the both sides of a 
body supporting a seat, a tiltable plate is provided 
outside each of the sides of the seat. This wheelchair 
can freely travel, as in a conventional wheelchair, by 
a person sitting down on the seat who turns the 
travelling wheels by his or her own exertion, or by an 
attendant who holds and pushes the handles. Upon 
getting on or off, a side of the seat can be opened for  
 
movement for getting on or off. This movement is 
therefore far easier than in the conventional wheelchair, 
enabling a physically handicapped person to get 
on or off without relying upon help of the other. It 
is necessary to provide the above-mentioned wheels at a 
position not hindering tilting of the tiltable plate. 
Where applicable, the travelling wheels may be provided 
at a position closer to the back under the seat, with a 
tiltable plate outside a side of the seat, and a 
driving wheel may be vertically movably provided for 
manual turning outside the tiltable plate, the driving 
wheel and the travelling wheel being connected with a 
transmission belt. Furthermore, the seat may be 
provided in a state inserted
