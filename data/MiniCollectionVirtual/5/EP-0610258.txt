<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to charging stations for electric vehicles. 
In particular, this invention provides high power chargers at which 
electric vehicles may have their on-board batteries recharged 
quickly, efficiently, and safely. While, in general, the present invention is specifically directed 
to electric vehicles of the sort that are, essentially, passenger 
vehicles or cargo vehicles such as vans and light trucks, it will be 
kept in mind that the present invention is equally adapted for use 
with such other electric vehicles as electric golf carts, fork lift 
trucks and other industrial trucks and pallet lifters, and the like. 
However, as discussed in greater detail hereafter, the present 
invention particularly lends itself to commercial applications wherein 
electric vehicles such as passenger vehicles and on-road cargo 
vehicles may recharge their batteries in much the same manner as 
present day vehicles having internal combustion engines re-fill their 
fuel tanks. Thus, a charging station for electric vehicles in keeping 
with the present invention may be found at street corners, along 
highways, and so on. There are presently a number of experimental electric vehicles 
of the passenger type. Almost universally, however, those vehicles 
are extremely inefficient, carry very heavy batteries, and at best 
have very limited range of perhaps 100 or 200 km before the 
batteries need to be recharged. Significant research is being carried 
on throughout the world to develop new batteries which have much 
higher power per unit weight, and higher capacity, so as to allow 
faster and more long-ranging vehicles to be developed; and the 
present invention recognizes that as such vehicles reach the road 
either experimentally or particularly as commercial vehicles, there will 
be a much greater requirement for facilities to recharge them. Of  
 
course, such charging stations must be capable of delivering 
charging power to the batteries safely, quickly, and economically. It follows that such charging stations must be capable of being 
controlled in such a manner that different batteries, having different 
capacities and even different terminal voltages -- or, for that matter, 
being of different types -- must be accommodated at the charging 
station for delivery of charging power. That means that there must 
be sufficient control either within the charging station or associated 
with the batteries to be charged, to permit such charging conditions; 
and as well, the charging station must be equipped

A system for charging an electric vehicle (20) that is equipped with 
a rechargeable battery (22), a traction motor (24) and a traction controller (26) for 

said traction motor, said system being characterised by : 

a power section (30A) which is separate from the vehicle, a power 
controller section (32) which is separate from the vehicle, a power connector (34) 

on said vehicle for connecting said power section to said electric vehicle for 
recharging the battery thereof, an interface between said power section and power controller section and said 

electric vehicle, power cables (36) capable of carrying high charging currents from 
said power section through said power connector to said electric vehicle, signal
