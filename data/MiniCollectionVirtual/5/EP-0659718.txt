<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing a cycloolefin which comprises partially 
hydrogenating monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to form 
the corresponding cycloolefins, particularly cyclohexene. Cycloolefins are important intermediate compounds for 
lactams, dicarboxylic acids as starting materials for 
polyamides, lysines, medicines and agricultural 
chemicals. Heretofore, a number of methods have been known with 
respect to methods for the production of cycloolefins, 
such as partial hydrogenation of monocyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, dehydration of cycloalkanols and 
dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of 
cycloalkanes. Especially, if a cycloolefin can be 
produced efficiently by partially hydrogenating a 
monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, the reaction process can 
be the most simplified, such being desirable from 
viewpoint of the industrial process.  
 As a method for producing a cycloolefin by partially 
hydrogenating a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, it is 
common to employ a method wherein ruthenium metal is 
mainly used as a catalyst and hydrogenation reaction is 
conducted in the presence of water and a metal salt. For 
such a ruthenium catalyst, many proposals have been made, 
such as a method wherein fine metal ruthenium particles 
are used by themselves (e.g. Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publications No 50930/1986, No. 45541/1987 and No. 
45544/1987), and a method wherein a catalyst having 
ruthenium supported on a carrier such as silica, alumina, 
barium sulfite or zirconium silicate, is used (e.g. 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 130926/1982, 
No. 40226/1986 and No. 74141/1992). However, each of such conventional methods has some 
problems and is not necessarily advantageous from the 
industrial viewpoint. The problems may, for example, be 
such that the selectivity for the desired cycloolefin is 
not adequate, that the catalytic activity is so low that 
it is difficult to produce the cycloolefin efficiently, 
that the durability of the catalyst is inadequate, and 
that handling efficiency of the catalyst is poor. Further, in many conventional methods, it is 
necessary to add an additive such as a metal salt, an 
acid or an alkali to the reaction system. Such an 
additive not only makes the reaction system complicated, 
but accelerates corrosion of the reactor, or consumption  
 
or deterioration of the catalyst. Therefore, from the 
industrial point of view, a method is desired wherein no 
such an additive is incorporated. The present inventors have
