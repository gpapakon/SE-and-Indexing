<ABSTRACT>
A communication network having a service processor (TÎ¦), 
a plurality 

of terminal nodes (T1-T15), and a network of switch nodes (A-H) for 
switchably connecting the service processor to each terminal 

node by way of one or more connection paths. Each 
switch node in the communication network is connected to 

the service processor either directly or through one or 
more other switch nodes. Each terminal node of the communication 

network is connected to a switch node. Each 
switch node and each terminal node has a device identification. 

At least two nodes have the same device identification. 
Each target node having the same device 

identification as another node can preferably be connected 
to the service processor by way of at least one connection 

path which does not any other node having the same device 
identification as the target node. All switch nodes having 

the same minimum connection path length may, for example, 
have the same device identification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to communication networks, such as 
for parallel processing systems. Parallel processing systems are computer systems containing 
large numbers of terminal nodes. The terminal nodes may 
be, for example, processors, memory elements, input/output 
servers, or other computer devices. The terminal nodes in 
parallel systems are commonly connected by a network of 
switch nodes that transfer information signals between the 
terminal nodes. Terminal nodes and switch nodes may be 
referred to collectively as network devices. Message-passing networks typically route message packets by 
circuit-switching or by packet-switching. In circuit-switching, 
control packets create a source-to-destination 
message path through the network by configuring individual 
switches along the desired connection path or circuit. 
Once a circuit is configured, one or more message packets 
are transmitted from the source to the destination over the 
circuit. In contrast, for packet-switching, each message 
packet is self-routing. That is, each message packet contains 
its own routing information which controls the individual 
switches dynamically. A circuit-switched network can be subclassified according 
to the underlying method of circuit configuration used by 
the control packets. If the control packets also obey 
circuit-switching to configure the network, the network is 
referred to as totally circuit-switched. In contrast, it  
 
is possible to construct a network in which control packets 
are packet-switched, and other message packets are circuit-switched. Most message-passing networks have (1) message-passing 
activities in which the network transports messages from a 
source terminal node to a destination terminal node, and 
(2) service activities in which a service processor controls, 
initializes, interrogates, or otherwise services the 
communication network. These contrasting functions may be 
implemented by separate communication networks, each connecting 
all network devices. Alternatively, the message-passing 
and the service activities may be time-multiplexed 
in a single unified network. The requirements of network service differ in several 
respects from the standard message passing activities of 
the communication network. A service processor is highly 
likely to send or receive a number of service message 
packets to or from one particular network device before 
commencing communication with a different network device. 
That is, there exists a high degree of temporal locality in 
service
