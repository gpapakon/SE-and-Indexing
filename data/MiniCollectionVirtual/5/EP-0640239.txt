<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) suited for inspecting selected positions of a nuclear power plant. The invention comprises a boom (12) for extending to a position in a nuclear power station to be inspected, and a video camera (14) affixed to the boom for permitting the visual inspection of the position to be inspected. In preferred embodiments, the video camera (14) is affixed to a pan and tilt mechanism which may be adjusted by a remote joystick or by a control box (25) situated on the boom. The video camera includes an auto-focus feature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INSPECTION DEVICEField of the InventionThe present invention is directed to the field of inspection devices and methods. In particular, the present invention is directed to nuclear power plant inspection devices.Background of the Invention Nuclear power plants typically contain three major components as shown in Figure 1: a reactor which produces superheated water which is transported to one or more steam generators; the one or more steam generators which generate steam; and a power turbine, driven by the generated steam, which produces electrical power. Nuclear power plants may have miles of pipes and ducts which must be inspected and examined for corrosion, leakage and damage. These regions include the reactor bowl, the tube sheet, support plates and the tubing within the steam generator.It is particularly difficult to inspect all areas of the plant including the primary bowl and steam generator. These areas are often highly radioactive and may leak contaminated liquids. Typically, direct human inspection of the key areas of the steam generator and reactor bowl is " limited to several minutes per six-month period. 

 There are a number of issued patents which disclose devices for nuclear power plant inspection and repair. U.S. Patent No. 4,673,027 discloses a device for inspecting and repairing the tubes of a nuclear reactor steam generator. The device includes a manipulator which is insertible in the chamber and which may be locked onto the tube sheet for supporting remotely controlled and monitored inspection instruments and tools. The manipulator includes a support leg which is adjustable in length in an axial direction, a main arm connected to and movable relative to the support leg and an equipment carrier which is connected to the main arm.U. S. Patent No. 4,653,971 discloses a device for selectively positioning a tool carried by a vehicle which moves on a perforated plate, while the device utilizes an elbow which swings a telescoping arm into position.Similarly, U. S. Patent No. 4,945,979 discloses an improved robotic arm for effecting a tube plugging operation. The system also includes an elbow control mechanism.U. S. Patent No. 4,205,939 discloses an apparatus for remotely repairing the tubes in a steam generator. The device includes a boom pivotally mounted on a column and a system for rotating the column and the boom therewith. The disclosed device further includes a tool which is operable on the tubes. U. S. Patent No. 4,231,419 discloses a manipulator for inspecting and repairing the
