<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inspection of a
semiconductor integrated circuit device and, more
particularly, to a repair data editing system for
automatically editing repair data used in rescuing
defective products from rejection.A typical example of an ultra large scale integration
is a semiconductor memory device, and the memory capacity
of the semiconductor memory device has been progressively
increased through miniaturization of the circuit
components. However, the miniaturized circuit components
are liable to be damaged by crystal defects left in the
semiconductor wafer, and a product with the damaged circuit
component is diagnosed as a defective product through
inspections before delivery to a customer. If the
manufacturer rejects all of the defective products, the
production yield becomes low, and the customers may
complain of high price.For this reason, the manufacturer tries to rescue the 
defective products from the rejection. One of the
rescuing techniques is to previously prepare redundant
memory cells. If a defective memory cell is found in a
test sequence, the defective memory cells are replaced with
the redundant memory cells, and the redundant memory cells
serves as parts of the memory cell array instead of the
defective memory cells. The replacement is usually carried
out by memorizing the addresses of the defective memory
cells. In the rescued product, the redundant memory cells
are coupled to a data buffer upon coincidence between the
address of an accessed memory cell and one of the
internally stored addresses. The internally stored
addresses are non-volatile, and are usually memorized by
selectively breaking fuse elements with a laser beam before
packaging. The rescued products are checked to see whether
or not the defective memory cells are perfectly replaced
with the redundant memory cells through a test sequence
again.Thus, the testing sequence, the laser trimming and
the post-trimming test sequence are required for the
rescue. Figure 1 illustrates the prior art repairing
system, and the prior art repairing system largely
comprises a host computer 1 accompanied with a terminal 2 
and a fixed disk memory unit 3, a test system 4 and a laser
trimming system 5. The terminal 2 provides an interface
between the host computer 1 and an operator 6, and the host
computer 1 is communicable with the testing system 4 and
the laser trimming system 5 through network cables 7a and
7b. The testing system 4 executes a test program PG for
semiconductor memories on wafers WF to determine whether or
n
