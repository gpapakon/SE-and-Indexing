<ABSTRACT>
A high-strength Pb-free solder alloy, based on the Sn-Ag-Zn system, is 
disclosed. The addition of Zn significantly improves the mechanical strength and 

creep resistance of e.g., Sn-3.5% Ag eutectic solder while maintaining substantially 
the same level of ductility. The increase in strength is as much as 48% over that of 

the Sn-3.5% Ag alloy. This strengthening from the Zn additions is attributed to a 
uniform solidification structure and a substantial refinement of the precipitates in the 

alloy. Essentially all of the added Zn resides in the more corrosion-resistant, Ag-based, 
intermetallic precipitates, leaving the Sn-rich matrix primarily free of Zn in 

solid solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article comprising solder, more specifically 
Pb- free solder. Solder bonding is a critical step in many industrial processes, e.g., in 
semiconductor device manufacture. The currently most widely used solder probably 
is the eutectic Pb-Sn alloy. However, due to the toxicity of lead (Pb), there is 
currently substantial interest in finding a Pb-free substitute solder alloy. The eutectic tin-silver (Sn-Ag) alloy is a known Pb-free solder, (see 
W. B. Hampshire, ElectronicMaterialsHandbook Vol. 1, Packaging, ASM 
International, Metals Park, OH, 1989, p. 633) that has some advantageous 
characteristics, e.g., good ductility. Unfortunately, the alloy also has some 
drawbacks, e.g., insufficient creep resistance especially for applications requiring 
high dimensional stability. The manufacturing yields and service lifetimes of 
microelectronic products often depend on the mechanical integrity of solder joints. 
While breaking is the most obvious problem, misalignment of a laser chip by 
mechanical creep and the resultant loss of information in the optical system is also a 
problem. It would be desirable to have available a Sn-Ag based solder composition 
that has improved mechanical strength and creep resistance while retaining the 
advantageous characteristics of the prior art Sn-Ag solder. This application discloses 
such compositions. We have made the unexpected discovery that the addition of Zn to a 
Sn-Ag alloy can result in a solder composition of improved mechanical properties. 
Thus, in a broad aspect, this invention relates to Pb-free solder alloys based on a tin-silver-zinc 
(Sn-Ag-Zn) system. More particularly, the invention is embodied in an 
article that comprises an essentially Pb-free solder composition comprising at least 
50% (typically at least 80%) by weight Sn, between 0.1 and 10% by weight Ag and 
an effective amount of Zn for increasing the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) and/or 
offset yield strength (YS) of the solder composition by at least 10% of an otherwise 
identical Zn-free comparison composition. In an exemplary preferred embodiment, 
the composition comprises 1% Zn, 3.5% Ag and 95.5% Sn.  We have found that the addition of Zn to Sn-Ag binary alloys can 
produce a uniform and refined microstructure with very small precipitates, and result 
in significantly improved mechanical strength while maintaining substantially the 
same level of ductility as in a corresponding Zn-free alloy. The Zn addition typically 
also improves the character of the
