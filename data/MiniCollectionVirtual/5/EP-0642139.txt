<ABSTRACT>
The easily strippable cable comprises electrical conductors which are individually insulated and joined together into formed assemblies, and a continuous insulating sheath surrounding the said assemblies and separating them into two groups. It is characterized in that the said sheath (3) is divided into two tubular portions (31, 32) which are substantially half open, with respect to each other, along the said cable and are connected to each other via two tongues (34, 35) for peripheral continuity and for opening, as desired, the said sheath. Application: high-frequency signal transmission cable.

<CLAIMS>
Easy-strip cable including individually insulated 
electrical conductors assembled into separate sets and at 

least one continuous insulative sheath around said sets and 
separating them into two groups, characterised in that each 

continuous insulative sheath (3) has two tubular portions 
(31, 32) substantially partly open at facing locations along 

the cable, around said sets and separating the two groups 
(1, 2; 1', 2'), and two substantially parallel peripheral 

continuity tongues (34, 35) joining the two tubular portions, 
delimiting between them on said continuous insulative sheath a 

constriction (33) whose width is less than the diameter of the 
insulated conductors and adapted by rupture of at least one of 

them to open said continuous insulative sheath as required. 
Cable according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said tongues are substantially adjacent but not fused together 

and independent of each other. 
Cable according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said tongues are adjacent and slightly adherent to each other 

but separable from each other. 
Cable according to claim 2 or claim 3 characterised 
in that it has a longitudinal groove (36, 37) on at least one 

of the tongues constituting a weakened area from which it can 
be ruptured. 
Cable according to any one of claims 2 to 4 
characterised in that said continuous insulative sheath is 

extruded. 
Cable according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein 
the sets are pairs and characterised in that it includes at 

least one pair of insulative conductors in each of said 
tubular portions of said continuous insulative sheath. 
Cable according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that it includes a single star quad in each 

of the tubular portions of said continuous insulative sheath. 
Cable according to any one of claims 2 to 4  
 

characterised in that said continuous insulative sheath is a 
single outer sheath of the cable. 
Cable according to any one of claims 2 to 4 
characterised in that said continuous insulative sheath is an 

inner sheath of the cable and is covered with a screen (4) 
which is itself covered with an outer sheath (5).
