<ABSTRACT>
An extensible set of auxiliary services for objects in an object-oriented 
system. Every object in an object-oriented system is implemented by an 

associated object manager. Each object manager in the present invention has an 
associated object manager identifier that identifies the object manager. Each object 

manager in the system can optionally provide various auxiliary services for objects 
that the object manager implements. These auxiliary services are objects 

implemented by the object manager itself, or by another object manager. For a 
particular type of auxiliary service, different object managers may provide 

different auxiliary services. For example, two object managers may provide two 
different freeze-melt services. For each type of auxiliary service type, there is a 

well-known context in which auxiliary services of that type are associated with 
names. For each type of auxiliary service, there is also a well-known function that 

transforms an object manager identifier into a name. When a client of an object 
needs to access an auxiliary service for an object, the client first invokes an 

operation within the object that provides the object manager identifier for the 
object manager that manages the object. The client then passes the object manager 

identifier to the well-known function for the desired type of auxiliary service that 
transforms the object manager identifier into a name. The client resolves the 

transformed name within a well-known context for the type of auxiliary service 
desired to obtain a representation of the desired auxiliary service.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of object-oriented
programming. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for
providing an extensible set of auxiliary services for objects in an object-oriented
system and a method for providing secure freeze services.In an object-oriented system, an object comprises a collection of data
along with a set of functions for manipulating the collection of data. The collection
of data is referred to as the object's state data. The functions for manipulating the
state data are referred to as operations. Each object has an associated object
manager which is the server that implements the operations of the object and
maintains the collection of data in the object.To perform an operation on an object, a client sends a message to the
object to "invoke" one of the operations within the object. The message sent to an
object comprises an operation selector and parameter data. The operation selector
in the message selects the operation within the object that will be used to
manipulate the object. The parameter data in the message provides external
information that will be used by the invoked operation. Alter the operation has 
completed, the operation usually returns a return value to the client that provides
the results of the operation invocation.In addition to the unique operations within each object, it is
convenient to have a set of "auxiliary services" that perform maintenance
operations on the objects within the system. Examples of auxiliary services
include a freeze-melt service for creating persistent objects and a duplication
service for creating copies of objects with different access rights. The auxiliary
services for an object may be implemented by the object's object manager or by
another object manager. For a particular auxiliary service type, different object
managers may provide different auxiliary services. For example, two different
object managers may provide two different freeze-melt services. Since the
auxiliary services may perform sensitive operations, access to auxiliary services
must be made secure.For examples of prior art discussion of object-oriented
computing systems see EP-A-0 501 601 (Hewlett-Packard) and IBM
Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 32, no. 10A, March 1990, entitled 'Object
Data Manager' pp 55-57. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a set of
auxiliary services for the objects in the object-oriented system.It is a further objective of the present invention to provide said set of

<CLAIMS>
A method providing an extensible set of auxiliary services for objects in
an object-oriented system, said object-oriented system comprising first object

manager (30), said first object manager (30) managing a plurality of objects
(31, 61), said method comprising the steps of:


creating a plurality of auxiliary service objects, each of said plurality of
auxiliary service objects comprising at least one auxiliary service operation;
providing a name server, said name server comprising a plurality of
context objects, each of said context objects comprising a plurality of name-to-object

associations
implementing a "get object manager identifier" operation in each of said
plurality of objects, said "get object manager identifier" operation returning an

object manager identifier associated with an object manager that manages
said object;
transforming said object manager identifier into an auxiliary service
object name having a desired auxiliary service;
resolving said auxiliary service object name associated with said
desired auxiliary service in one of said plurality of context objects to receive a

representation of said auxiliary service object; and
invoking one of the auxiliary service operations within said auxiliary
service object using said representation of said auxiliary service object.
The method providing as claimed in claim 1, wherein said auxiliary
service object name associated with a desired auxiliary service comprises a

name that identifies said desired auxiliary service with said object manager.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein one of said auxiliary
services is a freeze-melt service, said freeze-melt service used to make

objects persistent. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein one of said auxiliary
services is an object duplication service, said object duplication service used

to create copies of objects.
The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said object duplication
service creates copies of objects with different access rights.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a new auxiliary service is
added by implementing said new auxiliary service object and binding at least

one auxiliary service object name to said new auxiliary service object in one of
said plurality of contexts.
The method as clamed in claim 1 further comprising the steps of

creating a freeze-melt service object, said freeze-melt service object
comprising
 a freeze operation and a melt operation, said freeze-melt service
object having at least one freeze-melt service object name;
wherein one of said plurality of name-to-object associations comprises
an association of said freeze-melt service object name to a representation of

said freeze-melt service object;
implementing a transformation function that transforms said object
manager identifier into said freeze-melt service object name;
obtaining for an object access to both said freeze operation and said
melt operation by invoking said "get object manager identifier" operation in

said object to obtain said object manager identifier;
calling said transformation function to transform said object manager
identifier into said freeze-melt service object name; and
resolving said freeze-melt service object name in said context object to
receive a representation of said freeze-melt service object.
The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein said secure freeze-melt
service comprises an object implemented by a second object manager.
The method defined by claim 1 further comprising the steps of 

creating a duplication service object, said duplication service object
