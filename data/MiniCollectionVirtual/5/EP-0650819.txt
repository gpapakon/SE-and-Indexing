<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a mould 
for forming an expansion, such as a socket, in a plastic 

pipe, and a plastic pipe. According to the method, the 
heated end of the pipe is placed in an external mould 

(2) and pressed against the mould surface (6) to form 
a socket. Two grooves (8, 9) can be formed in the socket 

by a simple method, using a mould ring (12) which is 
separate from the other parts (3, 4) of the mould and 

by means of which the grooves of the socket are formed. 
The ring is simultaneously locked into the socket (7), 

thereby functioning as a reinforcement ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
forming an expansion, such as a socket, in a plastic
pipe
according to the precharacterising part of claim 1,
to a mould for forming
an expansion
according to the precharacterising part of claim 2
and to a plastic pipe
according to the precharacterising part of claim 6,
such as known
from DE-A-19 24 557.It is often necessary to make various expansions
in plastic pipes manufactured by extrusion, for
example. A typical expansion is a socket at the end of
the pipe, which enables a socket joint between pipes.
However, plastic pipes can also be provided with other
local expansions, which are used for example for fastening,
support or installation of the pipe. In order to
simplify the description, the following will focus on
manufacture of the most common expansion, the socket.Plastic pipes are generally joined together by
socket joints. In order to achieve sealing between the
socket and the insertion portion, a groove is made in
the inner surface of the socket, and a sealing ring is
disposed in the groove and presses against the socket
and the insertion portion.In order to achieve axial locking particularly
for pipelines that transport a pressurized fluid, two
grooves have been formed in the pipe, axially in succession
at a certain distance from each other, see e.g.
U.S. Patent 4 111 464 and UK Patent Application
2 166 508. In the sockets disclosed in these publications,
one groove is for the sealing ring and the other 
for the locking ring. The locking is the most efficient
if the locking ring is wedge-shaped, as disclosed in the
above UK application.Pipe sockets provided with two inner grooves
are difficult to manufacture. This is the case particularly
in the manufacture of molecule-oriented pipes for
example in accordance with UK Patent 1 589 052. Herein
the mould is a uniform cylinder being nearly equal in
length to the pipe, and the pipe is removed from it by
opening the end nearest the socket and by axially pulling
the pipe from the mould. In this case the division
surface of the parts of the external mould must be located
at the outermost part of the socket. A mould intended
for the manufacture of sockets with two grooves
must be capable of expanding radially at least at the
socket, which increases the costs considerably compared
with a one-part mould.For the above mentioned reason, the two-groove
sockets of conventional pipes are usually manufactured
in a separate step for example by extrusion and connected
directly to the pipe by glueing or welding. For

A method for forming an expansion, such as
a socket (7), in a plastic pipe (1), wherein at least the pipe

part to be formed as the socket (7) is heated, said
pipe part is placed in a mould (2) having an inner mould

surface (6) and surrounding the pipe part, and internal
pressure is applied to expand the pipe part against the

mould surface (6), whereby
before the expansion of the pipe (1), the mould (2) is

complemented with a mould ring (12), whose surface facing the
pipe (1) forms at least a part of the mould surface (6), and

said ring (12) coming off with the socket when it is removed
from the mould (2) and 

whereafter the pipe part is cooled
and removed from the mould (2), 
characterized

in that
said ring (12) being locked into the

socket (7) when the socket is formed
such that said mould ring (12) protrudes from the mould surface

(6) towards the centre line (CL) of the mould surface (6).
A mould for forming an expansion, such
as a socket (7), in a plastic pipe (1), the mould including

a body (3, 4) which is intended to surround at least
the part of the plastic pipe (1) to be formed as the

socket (7) and which has an inner mould surface (6),
against which the pipe part is to be pressed when

the socket (7) is formed, the mould (2) also including
a mould ring (12) inside the mould body (3, 4), whose

surface facing the pipe (1) forms at least a part of the
mould surface (6), said ring (12) being separate from the

mould body (3, 4) so that it can come off with the
socket (7) when it is removed from the mould (2),


characterized
 in that the mould ring
(12) has a cross-section such that it protrudes from

the mould surface (6) of the body (3, 4) towards the centre
line (CL) of the mould surface (6) so as to form at least

one groove (8, 9) in the socket (7).
A mould according to claim 2, 
characterized

in that the mould ring (12) is
pressed against the inner surface of the body (3, 4). 
A mould according to claim 2, 
characterized

in that the mould ring (12) is of one
piece.
A mould according to claim 2, 
characterized

in that the mould ring (12) is of
rigid plastic.

such as a socket (7), for joining, fastening

or supporting the pipe (1), the socket (7) being provided
with two or more grooves (8, 9), at least a part

of the outer surface of the expansion being surrounded
by a mould ring (12), which is locked in position

during the formation of the socket (7).

characterized
 in that the mould ring
