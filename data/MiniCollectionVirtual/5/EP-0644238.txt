<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel liquid crystal
polyester resin compositions excellent in thermal resistance,
molding processability and mechanical properties, and
particularly excellent in weld strength, impact resistance,
and thin wall properties, which can be utilized as molded
articles by injection molding or extrusion molding.Different from crystalline polyesters such as
polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate,
liquid crystal polyesters do not entangle in their molecules
even in the molten state due to their rigidity to form
polydomains in the liquid crystal state, and show the
behavior that the molecular chains are significantly
orientated in a flow direction by low shear. They are
generally referred to as melt type liquid crystal
(thermotropic liquid crystal) polymers. The liquid crystal
polyesters have very excellent melt flowability due to this
characteristic behavior, and thin-walled molded articles
having a thickness of about 0.2 to 0.5 mm can be easily 
obtained. Moreover, the molded articles offer the advantages
of high strength and high stiffness. However, they also have
the disadvantages of very large anisotropy and significantly
low weld strength. Furthermore, high molding temperatures
thereof have limited their use. The liquid crystal
polyesters have also the problem that they are generally
expensive.Inexpensive liquid crystal polyester resin
compositions retaining the excellent thermal resistance and
mechanical properties of the crystal polyesters and improved
in weld strength of their molded articles have been strongly
demanded from the market.A resin composition comprising a melt-processable
polymer and an anisotropic melt forming polymer is disclosed
in JP-A-56-115357 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"), wherein
it is described that addition of the anisotropic melt forming
polymer to the melt-processable polymer results in an
improvement in processability of the melt-processable
polymer. For example, addition of a liquid crystal polyester
to a polyphenylene ether/polystyrene mixture is exemplified
therein.For the purpose of improving solder heat resistance,
resin compositions in which liquid crystal polyesters are 
blended with various kinds of polyarylene oxides are
described in JP-A-2-97555.However, in general, a composition formed by blending
a liquid crystal polyester having a higher molding
temperature with an amorphous polymer such as polyphenylene
ether having a lower molding temperature than
