<ABSTRACT>
A gasket system (34,38) has a gasket adapted to be secured 
about an opening. The gasket includes a mechanism for 

retaining and sealing a window pane (14) or the like. The 
gasket (30) is positioned about the opening such that when 

the window pane (14) is positioned within the opening, the 
window pane (14) substantially conceals the gasket (30) and is 

flush at its perimeter with the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to weather stripping
gasket assemblies and, more particularly, to a weather
stripping gasket assembly that, when positioned on a
vehicle, provides the vehicle window panes with a
peripheral flush appearance with the vehicle body.In the automotive industry, it is desirable to
have movable window panes which are flush with the
vehicle body roof, door and side pillars. This
flushness, while providing an aesthetic appearance,
also provides aerodynamic characteristics and reduces
drag. When providing movable window panes that are
peripherally flush with the vehicle body, the sealing
of the window pane must be taken into consideration.
In a peripheral or four-sided flush movable window pane
system, the weather stripping is substantially behind
or on the interior of the window pane concealed from
view from the outside of the vehicle (see e.g. Figure 3
of EP-A-0061027). Such strips are known on vehicle
doors having a frame wherein a large part of the strip
is concealed behind the frame.Weather stripping currently utilized by the
automotive industry for movable window panes has a U-shaped
glass run channel. The U-shaped channel
sandwiches the window pane periphery between the legs
and web of the U-shaped channel to retain and seal the
window (see e.g. FR-A-2551826). These types of glass
run channel systems also have a portion of the weather
stripping or a moulding on the exterior or outside of
the window pane.DE-A-3236168 discloses a sealing system for a door
without a window frame having retaining means to retain
the weather strip on a flange and means for sealing and
spacing of the window pane from the surrounding body.FR-A-2138919 discloses a sealing system for a
door, the system having a flexible sealing element in 
contact with a window pane, the element being able to
bend in an upward direction during movement of the
window pane.Accordingly, the present invention provides the
art with a weather stripping system for movable vehicle
window panes which enable the windows to be
peripherally flush with the vehicle body. The present
invention provides the art with a weather stripping
system that is substantially concealed from view by the
movable window panes in a closed position.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a sealing system intended
to support and seal a window pane of a vehicle door in
which the door is not provided with a window frame, the
sealing system comprising a bottom weather strip
having:
means adapted to retain the weather strip
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sealing system intended to support and seal
a window pane (14) of a vehicle door (12, 13) in which

the door (12, 13) is not provided with a window frame,
the sealing system comprising a bottom weather strip

(38) having:

means adapted to retain the weather strip (38)
onto a flange or the like; and
means (108) adapted to wipe or contact a surface
of the window pane (14) or the like, said wiping means

(108) including an upper surface and a lower surface
and extending from the retaining means in a

substantially upwardly extending first position adapted
for interfering engagement with the window pane (14);

characterised in that the wiping means (108) is
such that when said window pane (14) is moved to a

second position the upper surface of the wiping means
(108) interferes with the window pane (14) along the

upper surface and flexes into a substantially
downwardly extending position generally parallel to the

window pane (14) for wiping the exterior of the window
pane (14) such that the wiping means (108) is

substantially concealed from view when coupled on said
flange.
A system according to claim 1, wherein said
retainin
g means further comprises a reinforcement
member (94) having, in cross-section, a U-shaped

channel and an elastomeric skin (96) surrounding said
reinforcement member (94).
A system according to claim 2, wherein said
skin (96) includes a thickened portion (98).
A system according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
said wiping means (108) comprises a member extending

from said elastomeric skin (96).
A system according to claim 4, wherein said
extending member includes a low friction coating (10), 

for example flocking, for contacting the window pane.
A system according to any one of claims 1 to
5, wherein said wiping means (108) comprises a mylar

member surrounded by flocking extending from said
weather strip.
A system according to any one of claims 1 to
6, further comprising means (104) adapted for providing

sealing and spacing of the perimeter of the window
pane.
A system according to any one of claims 1 to
7, further comprising:


an elastomeric member (118) secured to a flange
(128) of a vehicle including a horizontal member (120)

and a vertical member (122) preferably together forming
a "T" shape, said vertical member (122) including means

adapted for retaining said elastomeric member onto said
flange (128) or the like, said horizontal member (120)

adapted for sealing contact with a door panel and a
window member (112) in a closed position.
A system according to claim 8, wherein said
vertical member retaining means includes a U-shaped

reinforcement member (124) surrounded by said
elastomeric member (118) adapted for securing to the

flange (128) or the like.
A sealing system intended to support and seal
a window pane (14) of a vehicle door (12, 13) in which

the door (12, 13) is not provided with a window frame,
the sealing system comprising a top weather strip (36)

having:

means adapted to retain the weather strip (36) on
