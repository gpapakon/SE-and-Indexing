<ABSTRACT>
A slipper bushing (3) is described as being comprised 
of a number of succeedingly larger cylindrical sleeves, 

beginning with a rigid, inner sleeve (6), followed by a 
polymeric sleeve (8), then a resilient elastomeric sleeve 

(9), and finally, a rigid, outer sleeve (7). The inner 
cylindrical surface of the elastomeric sleeve abutting the 

outer cylindrical surface of the polymeric sleeve, is 
provided with a number of circumferentially oriented 

grooves (32). A lubricant (33) is placed between the 
interfaces of the polymeric and elastomeric sleeves and 

moves into and out of the grooves, as the bushing 
operates. End caps (10,11) are used at the flange and 

barrel ends (4,5) of the slipper bushing to cover the 
sleeves and seal the interfaces between them from 

contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bushings, and especially 
to slipper bushings e.g. as are used in automobile 
suspension systems to provide relative rotation or 
slippage between rigid inner and outer sleeves of the 
bushing. This is conventionally accomplished by using a 
resilient, tubular rubber insert or sleeve which is bonded 
or press fitted to one of the metal sleeves. US-A-3,171,699, 3,215,477, 3,300,257, 
4,671,678 and 5,100,114 are typical of the many patents 
relating to simple bushings which employ a resilient 
elastomeric insert, with or without metal reinforcement, 
between rigid, inner and outer metal sleeves. 
US-A-4,744,677, 4,767,108 and 4,809,960 relate to more 
sophisticated bushings. US-A-5,139,244 discloses a 
slipper bushing, which essentially comprises; (i) a 
hollow, cylindrical, inner metal sleeve, (ii) a specially 
shaped, resilient elastomeric insert or sleeve which is 
force fitted around the inner metal sleeve, (iii) an outer 
polymeric sleeve which surrounds the elastomeric sleeve in 
abutting relation, such that relative movement between the 
elastomeric and polymeric sleeves can occur, (iv) a 
lubricant between the interfaces of the elastomeric and 
polymeric sleeves to facilitate such relative movement, 
and (v) a pair of hollow, metal end caps force fitted to 
the opposing ends of the inner metal sleeve. The slipper 
bushing has good performance characteristics. However, it 
has been found that under very severe loading, the 
elastomeric sleeve becomes axially distorted or tends to 
extend over the end caps at its opposing ends, to  
 
adversely affect operation of the bushing. The present 
invention seeks to eliminate or substantially reduce this 
problem by providing a bushing with an increased capacity 
for resisting either or both of lateral or axial loads 
without becoming distorted excessively. The invention provides a slipper bushing comprising a 
hollow, rigid, cylindrical inner sleeve, a polymeric 
sleeve secured around the inner sleeve, a resilient 
elastomeric insert or sleeve surrounding the polymeric 
sleeve in abutting relation therewith, a lubricant between 
the abutting interfaces or surfaces of the polymeric and 
elastomeric sleeves, a rigid outer sleeve to which the 
polymeric sleeve is bonded and end caps, preferably rigid 
and hollow, for sealing the opposing ends of the bushing, 
especially the lubricated interfaces between the polymeric 
and elastomeric sleeves. The lubricated interfaces are 
provided with a plurality of circumferentially oriented 
groove

A slipper bushing having a flange end opposite a 
barrel end, comprising: 


(a) a hollow, rigid inner sleeve having an outer 
cylindrical surface defined between a pair of opposing, 

annular ends adjacent the flange and barrel ends of the 
bushing; 
(b) a polymeric sleeve, secured around the outer 
cylindrical surface of the inner sleeve in concentric 

relation therewith, said sleeve having an outer 
cylindrical surface which is radially spaced from the 

outer cylindrical surface of the inner sleeve, and which 
is defined between a pair of opposing annular ends 

adjacent the flange and barrel ends of the bushing, the 
end of said sleeve adjacent the flange end of the bushing

the inner sleeve; 
(c) a sleeve, composed of resilient elastomeric 
material, surrounding the polymeric sleeve in concentric 

relation, the elastomeric sleeve having, (i) an inner 
cylindrical surface, which is in abutting relation with 

the outer cylindrical surface of the polymeric sleeve, and 
(ii) an outer cylindrical surface which is radially spaced 

from the inner cylindrical surface and defined between a 
first, integrally formed annular flange at the flange end 

of the bushing and a second, smaller diameter annular 
flange at the barrel end of the bushing, the first annular 

flange having an outwardly facing annular recess for 
matingly receiving the annular flange of the polymeric 

sleeve, one of the abutting cylindrical surfaces of the 
elastomeric and polymeric sleeves having therein, a 

plurality of circumferentially oriented grooves;
