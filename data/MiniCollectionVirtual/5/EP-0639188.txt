<ABSTRACT>
In the process according to the invention for the preparation of thiophene and particularly a thiophene, the non-sulphur bound carbon of which is substituted, the product is produced by treating succinic anhydride or especially substituted succinic anhydride with a sulphur compound. The sulphur compound is preferably a sulphur compound, which contains phosphorus, such as phosphorus pentasulphide. The stated treatment with a sulphur compound forms according to one embodiment the end stage of the process, in which 1-alkene is attached to maleic anhydride to give an 1-alkenyl-succinic anhydride, the 1-alkenylsuccinic anhydride is hydrogenated catalytically to produce an alkylsuccinic anhydride and the alkylsuccinic anhydride is treated with the above-mentioned sulphur compound to give a thiophene, the non-sulphur bound carbon of which, e.g. 3-carbon, is substituted.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for preparing thiophene and its derivativesThe invention relates to a process for the preparation of 3- alkylthiophene.It is generally known that the preparation of 3-substituted thiophene is more difficult than the preparation of 2- substituted thiophene. 3-substituted thiophene is, however, a desirable intermediate or end product in various appli¬ cations, such as a herbicide or fungicide. Certain 3- substituted thiophenes can also be used as monomers in the preparation of e.g. electrically conductive polymers.3-substituted thiophene can, in principle, be prepared through two different routes: by using thiophene or thiophene with a modifiable 3-substituent as starting material or by using an acyclic compound as the starting material. Substituted thiophenes can, of„ course, also be prepared by other means, but the products are then in most cases 2-substituted.The best known method of preparing 3-substituted thiophene by using thiophene as starting material is the bromination of thiophene. Bromine is added in about a threefold excess, whereby the bromine attaches both to the more reactive positions 2 and 5 and the position 3 mentioned, or to the positions 3 and 4. The bromine substituents in the positions 2 and 5 can then be reduced away with zinc and glacial acetic acid (Gronowitz, S. and Raznikiewicz, T. Org. Synth. 44 (1964), 9). 3-bromothiophene can be prepared cata¬ lytically technically more advantageously from 2.5-dibromo- thiophene and thiophene (Grosvenor, P.G., Fuller, L.S., EP 299,586). 3-bromothiophene is one of the most important intermediates for a wide selection of 3-substituted thiophenes, e.g. by using Grignard reactions, lithiation or oxidation. The use of 3-bromothiophene as a starting material in processes of production is seriously limited by 

 formation of non-desirable bromides and by difficult reaction conditions, such as an unsuitable temperature and an inert atmosphere.The preparation of 3-substituted thiophene by using an acyclic compound has been widely studied. These methods often have the drawback that they produce a lot of 2- substituted thiophenes as by-products. Among these methods the use of various mercaptans or thioethers as the starting material should be mentioned (Butler, A.R. , Henry, J.B., J. Chem. Soc, B, 1970 or Campaigne, E., Monroe, P. ., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 76 (1954), 2445). 3-substituted thiophene can also be prepared from other compounds containing either double-bonds or other functional groups (Veal, K.T., Grinter, T.J., EP 38121 or Duus, F.,
