<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a lubricating composition comprising a major amount of an 
oil of lubricating viscosity, (A) an hydrocarbyl phosphite, wherein each hydrocarbyl group is 

saturated and independently contains from about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms, (B) an organic 
polysulfide, and (C) (i) a borated overbased metal salt of an acidic organic compound, (ii) a 

combination of a borated dispersant and a phosphorus antiwear or extreme pressure agent 
selected from the group consisting of a phosphoric acid ester or salt thereof, a lower alkyl 

phosphite, and a phosphorus-containing carboxylic acid, ester, ether, or amide, or (iii) a 
mixture of (i) and (ii). These compositions provide improved frictional properties to 

lubricating composition while maintaining the extreme pressure protection of the lubricant. 
The lubricating compositions have good thermal stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lubricating compositions which contain a combination of additives which provide improved friction, extreme pressure and thermal stability properties to lubricating compositions. The lubricating compositions contain the combination of (A) a phosphite with (B) a polysulfide and (C) (i) a borated magnesium overbased composition, (ii) the combination of a borated dispersant and a phosphorus antiwear or extreme pressure agent or (iii) a mixture thereof.Although conventional differentials generally perform satisfactory under normal conditions, they suffer from a drawback called stalling. Stalling is the phenomenon under which if one wheel looses traction, the vehicle does not move. The reason for this is related to the design of the differential, where all of the driving torque is taken away by the wheel with less traction. Limited-slip differential design overcomes stalling by the use of clutch plates or friction cones. These devices help transfer more power to the wheel with traction. The result is that both wheels spin and the automobile moves. The common problem with these devices is the noise or chatter resulting from stick-slip (engagement-disengagement) phenomenon that occurs between the elements of clutches at low speeds. Additives, called friction modifiers, are used to impart proper frictional characteristics to the lubricant to overcome this problem.As a general rule, friction modifiers hurt the performance of antiwear and/or extreme pressure additives. Generally, the antiwear or extreme pressure additives in lubricants reduce damage by maintaining a layer of lubricant between the moving parts of the equipment. The additives of the lubricant which provide antiwear or extreme pressure help reduce harmful metal on metal contact. There is a need for lubricants for limited slip axles which provide a balance between frictional properties and antiwear/extreme pressure properties.Thermal stability of the lubricant is another important parameter. Traditional lubricants are unable to endure high operating temperatures of today's equipment and tend to decompose in the bulk and are not available when and where needed. There is a need for those lubricants to be thermally stable. One measure of thermal stability is the ASTM L-60 test. The antiwear extreme pressure protection is generally reflected in the ASTM L-42 test.Thus, the main technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide lubricating compositions with improved friction, extreme pressure and thermal stability
