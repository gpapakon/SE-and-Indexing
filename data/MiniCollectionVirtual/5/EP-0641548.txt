Screw for lumbo-sacral spine fixator, comprising a threaded part (1
a
), 
characterized in that it comprises a spherical head (1
b
) comprising a notched 
surface (1
e
) inclined with respect to the principal axis of the screw (1) by an angle 
(α) of about 30 to 45° and a tapped hole (1
f
) perpendicular to said notched 
surface. 
Screw according to Claim 1, characterized in that the threaded part (1
a
) 
comprises a conical core (1
c
) and a cutting thread (1
d
) of conical or straight profile 
over the whole of its length. 
Screw according to Claim 1, characterized in that said tapped, opening hole 
(1
f
) is provided to be open in the middle of the notched surface (1
e
). 
Screw according to Claim 1, characterized in that the spherical head (1
b
) is 
pierced with a second tapped hole (1
g
) which communicates with said tapped hole 
(1
h
). 
Screw according to Claim 4, characterized in that said second tapped hole 
is adapted to receive a stop screw (5) which allows a bolt (4) screwed in said 

tapped hole (1
f
) to be immobilized in rotation.
