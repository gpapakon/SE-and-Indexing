<ABSTRACT>
A human gene has been discovered which is genetically altered in human tumor cells. The genetic alteration is gene amplification and leads to a corresponding increase in gene products. Detecting that the gene, designated hMDM2, has become amplified or detecting increased expression of gene products is diagnostic of tumorigenesis. Human MDM2 protein binds to human p53 and allows the cell to escape from p53-regulated growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with support from the U.S. Government, including NIH 
grants CA-57345, CA-43460, CA-02243 and CA-35494. Accordingly, the Government 
retains certain rights in the invention. The invention relates to the area of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. More 
particularly, the invention relates to the detection of a gene which is amplified in certain 
human tumors. According to the Knudson model for tumorigenesis (Cancer Research, 1985, vol. 
45, p. 1482), there are tumor suppressor genes in all normal cells which, when they 
become non-functional due to mutation, cause neoplastic development. Evidence for this 
model has been found in cases of retinoblastoma and colorectal tumors. The implicated 
suppressor genes in these tumors, RB and p53 respectively, were found to be deleted or 
altered in many of the tumors studied. The p53 gene product, therefore, appears to be a member of a group of proteins 
which regulate normal cellular proliferation and suppression of cellular transformation. 
Mutations in the p53 gene have been linked to tumorigenesis, suggesting that alterations  
 
in p53 protein function are involved in cellular transformation. The inactivation of the 
p53 gene has been implicated in the genesis or progression of a wide variety of 
carcinomas (Nigro et al., 1989, Nature 342:705-708), including human colorectal 
carcinoma (Baker et al., 1989, Science 244:217-221), human lung cancer (Takahashi et 
al.. 1989, Science 246:491-494; Iggo et al., 1990, Lancet 335:675-679), chronic 
myelogenous leukemia (Kelman et al, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6783-6787) 
and osteogenic sarcomas (Masuda et al., 1987, Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7716-7719). While there exists an enormous body of evidence linking p53 gene mutations to 
human tumorigenesis (Hollstein et al., 1991, Science 253:49-53) little is known about 
cellular regulators and mediators of p53 function. Hinds et al. (Cell Growth & Differentiation, 1:571-580, 1990), found that p53 
cDNA clones, containing a point mutation at amino acid residue 143, 175, 273 or 281, 
cooperated with the activated ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts 
in culture. These mutant p53 genes are representative of the majority of mutations found 
in human cancer. Hollstein et al., 1991, Science 253:49-53. The transformed fibroblasts 
were found to produce elevated levels of human p53 protein having extended half-lives 
(1.5 to 7 hours) as compared to the normal (wild-type) p53 protein (20 to 30 minutes). Mutant p53 proteins
