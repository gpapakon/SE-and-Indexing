<ABSTRACT>
The furniture construction set comprises panel elements (20, 21, 22) which may be arranged optionally vertically and horizontally and exhibit at least one row of holes along their longitudinal borders (6). The rows of holes of the panel elements are arranged and designed such that the distance from hole centre to hole centre corresponds to the panel thickness d, and that the first hole of the at least one row of holes is spaced apart from one of the broad sides by a distance of d/2. In addition, all the panel elements are of a width of {n3d - d/2}, where n is any whole number. The construction set further comprises connecting angles (9) for connecting the panel elements (20, 21, 22). Said connecting angles each exhibit two legs which are positioned at right angles with respect to one another and are provided with from eight to ten openings which serve to receive fastening screws. Said furniture construction set permits a large number of possible combinations using a very small number of components, it also being possible, in particular, for the panel elements which are of a panel thickness d to be connected to panel elements whose panel thickness is not d, but 3d/4, d/2 or d/4.
