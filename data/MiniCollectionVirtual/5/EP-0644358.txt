<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a force generating device for producing a reversible working stroke of variable force acting in a defined direction, the working stroke acting on a force-receiving system (5) of a kind such that a reaction force that varies as a function of the travel develops as a result of elastic deformation exhibiting an essenially linear rise and fall. The force generation device according to the invention comprises a lever device (20) which is mounted in a fixed position relative to the force receiving system (5) by means of its lever bearing (24) and acts via a force application point, with a predetermined lever arm length, on the force receiving system, and further comprises an energy-storing force generator (10) in the form of a force cartridge which acts on the lever device at a variable position along its lever arm and, when the lever arm length is increased, is capable of releasing part of the energy stored in it and, when the lever arm length is reduced, of at least partially reabsorbing the energy taken up by the force receiving system, and further comprises an adjusting device (30) for the controllable adjustment of the position at which the force generator (10) acts on the lever arm (21) of the lever device. By means of this arrangement, efficiency is significantly increased over that of a conventional force generation device.
