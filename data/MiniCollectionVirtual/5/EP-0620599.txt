<ABSTRACT>
A high voltage integrated circuit (IC) has a 
passivation structure that shields the underlying circuit 

from the electrical effects of charge on the passivation 
structure. In one embodiment, the passivation structure 

comprises a silicon rich nitride layer in electrical 
contact with underlying circuit elements. The silicon 

rich nitride is highly resistive and permits only a 
negligible current between elements, but is conductive 

enough that charge on the surface of the passivation 
structure flows into the IC before the electric fields in 

the underlying circuit elements is significantly changed. 
In another embodiment, the passivation structure has two 

or more layers with a less conductive layer in contact 
with the underlying IC and overlying conductive layer 

which shields the IC from the effects of charge build up.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to passivation structures
overlying metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices, and
more particularly relates to passivation structures that
electrically shield underlying devices, and most
particularly relates to silicon rich nitride used as a
passivation layer for a lateral double-diffused MOS (DMOS)
field effect transistors.Lateral double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor
(lateral DMOS) transistors of the type having a
lightly-doped drain (LDD) region (or "LDD lateral DMOS
transistors") are often found in high-voltage integrated
circuits. Among these LDD lateral DMOS devices, the
self-isolated devices are especially desirable because of
their relative ease of integration with low-voltage
devices, which are often used to perform logic functions.
The self-isolated devices are so described because, for N-channel 
devices, each transistor's N+ drain and source
regions are separated from the N+ drain and source regions
of other transistors by the reverse-biased PN-junction
formed between each of these drain and source regions and
the p-type substrate. Because of self-isolation, the
self-isolated DMOS devices occupy less area and are
relatively less costly than either the junction-isolated
LDD lateral DMOS devices or the dielectric-isolated LDD
lateral DMOS devices. An overview of the various types of
LDD lateral DMOS devices discussed above can be found in
"Power Integrated Circuits -- A Brief Overview" by
B. Baliga, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol.
ED-33, No. 12, December 1986, pp.1936-9.Figure 1 is a cross section of an N-channel LDD
lateral DMOS transistor 100 showing the double-diffused N+
source region 102 and P-body region 103. The P-body and
source regions 103 and 102 are commonly connected by
conductor 120, which connects the P-body region 103 via
the P+ contact region 101. The drain of transistor 100 is
formed by the N- LDD or drift region 122 and the N+
contact region 107. Transistor 100 is controlled by the
voltage of gate 109, which is situated above the gate
oxide 110 and enclosed by insulation layer 121. Optionally,
a deep P+ region 104 can be formed to provide a good
contact to the P- substrate 105. This deep P+ region 104
does not significantly impact the breakdown voltage of
transistor 100, nor increase the parasitic capacitance
associated with the transistor 100. An optional N-well
106 can also be formed to provide a "deep" drain region
suitable for longer-drift high-voltage devices requiring a
higher breakdown voltage. Transistor breakdown often
occurs at
