<ABSTRACT>
Device for managing time commands for the remote control of apparatus and comprising a clock (4) intended to indicate the time, a programming means (6) making it possible to choose an absolute wake-up time, a means (7) for comparing the clock time with the absolute time, and a means of control (10) which can take an active state in which it sends a signal for switching on the apparatus and into which it is brought by the agreement of the clock time with the absolute time. According to the invention, the means of control (10) is superintended by a means (11) for correcting the absolute time which subtracts or adds a period which is specified with respect to the said absolute time chosen so as to fix a relative time, the said means of control (10) then passing into its active state at this relative time set automatically by means (12) with respect to the absolute time.

<CLAIMS>
Device for managing timing controls for the remote control 
of electrical appliances and comprising a clock (4) designed 

to indicate the time, a means (5) of adjusting the clock, a 
programming means (6) enabling an absolute alarm time to be 

chosen, a means (7) of comparing the clock time and the 
absolute alarm time, and a control means (10) which can adopt 

either an active state in which it sends data for starting up 
the appliances and into which it is brought as a result of 

agreement between the clock time and the absolute alarm time, 
or an inactive state in which it does not enable the 

functioning of the appliances in the absence of agreement, the 
said control means (10) being under the control of a means 

(11) of correcting the absolute alarm time which deducts or 
adds a given time with respect to the said absolute time 

chosen so as to fix a relative time, the said control (10) 
means then going to its active state at this relative time,
 
characterised in that the programming means (6) includes 

automatic means (12) for positioning the relative time with 
respect to the programmed absolute alarm time. 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the programming means (6) includes a 

first microcontroller including a random access memory for 
storing the absolute alarm time and the relative time and a 

permanent memory comprising the correction means (11), the 
automatic positioning means (12), the comparison means (7), 

and the control means (10) equipped with an interface (13) for 
communicating with the appliance, as well as a second 

microcontroller including the clock (4) and the adjustment 
means (5). 
Device according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the connection between the two 

microcontrollers is effected by means of a bus of the I2C  
 

type. 
Method for managing timing controls for the remote control 
of appliances using the device according to Claims 1 to 3 and 

in which use is made of a clock (4) designed to indicate the 
time, a means (5) for adjusting the clock, a programming means 

(6) enabling an absolute alarm time to be chosen, a means (7) 
for comparing the clock time and the absolute time, and a 

means (10) of controlling the said appliances according to the 
result from the comparison means, the said method including 

the following operations: 

a) programming of an absolute alarm time; 
b) programming, using a connection means (11), of a relative 
time with respect to the absolute alarm time; 
c) comparison of the clock time and the relative time; 
d) control of the functioning of the appliances with respect 
to the said relative time; 
 
characterised in that the operation c) is preceded by an 

operation consisting of automatic positioning of the relative 
time with respect to the programmed absolute alarm time. 
Management method according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that it is applied to a home automation 

installation in which carrier currents are used for the 
transmission of data between so-called slave transceivers (1) 

designed to control electrical appliances (2) and at least one 
master controller (3) including the clock (4), the adjustment 

means (5), the programming means (6), the comparison means 
(7), the control means (10), the correction means (11) and the 

automatic means (12) of positioning the relative time with 
respect to the absolute time.
