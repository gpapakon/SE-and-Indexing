<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a biological method for the purification of waste water contaminated with organic carbon and nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen compounds being first nitrified in an aerobic-treatment stage (1) and then denitrified in an anaerobic treatment stage (2), preferably to molecular nitrogen. The invention proposes that at least a part of the carbon compounds is separated from the waste water [e.g. by adsorption (3)] before it enters the aerobic-treatment stage and at least a part of the separated carbon compounds (4) is added back to the waste water to be treated anaerobically in the second stage. The method proposed enables optimum conditions to be established for the microorganisms present in each of the two stages.

Process for biological purification of waste water
contaminated with organic carbon compounds and nitrogen

compounds, wherein the nitrogen compounds are initially
nitrified in an aerobic treatment stage and then

de-nitrified in an anoxic treatment stage, preferably to
form molecular nitrogen, whereby prior to entering the

aerobic treatment stage at least one part of the carbon
compounds is separated from the waste water and the

separated carbon compounds are at least partially added
again to the anoxic waste water to be treated in the

second treatment stage, characterised in that two
surface-active adsorbers are used in each case for

separation of the organic carbon compounds, whereby

during the charging phase of one adsorber the other
adsorber is discharged into the anoxic treatment stage.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the anoxic treatment stage is in each case integrated

into the adsorber to be discharged.
Process according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the supply of carbon compounds to the anoxic

treatment stage is controlled according to the carbon
demand of the micro-organisms employed there.
