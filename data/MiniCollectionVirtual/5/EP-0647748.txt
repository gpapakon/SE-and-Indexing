<ABSTRACT>
A scaffolding (1) with vertical frames (2), floor planks (3, 4) and toe-boards (5, 6), of which the horizontal frame members (8) exhibit a profile web (18) which is arranged between the end edges (22, 23) of adjacent floor planks and spans the tread surface of the floor planks (16, 17) in a stepless manner, and profile flanges (19, 20) which are arranged on both sides of the profile web (18) serving as bearing surfaces (21) of adjacent floor planks and toe-boards.

A scaffold (1) with vertical frames (2) with vertical frame members (10) and
horizontal frame members (8) which comprise a sectional web (18) located

between the front edges (22, 23) of adjacent floorplanks and continuously
bridging the tread surface of floorplanks (16, 17), and profiled flanges (19,

20) arranged on both sides of said sectional web (18) serve as support surfaces
(21) of adjacent floorplanks and toe-boards, 
characterized in tha
t
toe-bords (5, 6) are provided for and said horizontal frame members (8) on

their angularly rigid connections (9) with said vertical frame members (7)
comprise widened support surfaces (25, 26) for said toe-board ends.
A scaffold as defined in clam 1, 
characterized in that
 said widenings (25,
26) at the angularly rigid connections (9) of said horizontal with said vertical

frame members (7, 8) consist of deformations of the profile of said horizontal
frame members (8).
