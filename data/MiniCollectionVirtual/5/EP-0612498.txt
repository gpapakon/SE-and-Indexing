<ABSTRACT>
A device capable of recording a bioelectrical signal under 
the normal living conditions of a living body is arranged 

so that an extremely real record can be obtained not only 
during a walk, a meal or a sleep of the living body but also 

even during bathing. 
A base member (2) having flexibility which permits it to 
follow the motion of the living body is provided with 

electrodes (11) for picking up electrical signals of the living 
body and a recording element (15) for recording the picked-up 

electrical signals. If the base member (2) is stuck on the living 
body, the electrodes (11) pick up the electrical signals of the 

living body and the picked-up electrical signals are recorded 
in the recording element. When the base member is stuck on 

the living body, the base member watertightly covers the 
electrodes. Accordingly, even if the living body is surrounded 

by water, the electrodes can pick up the electrical 
signals of the living body without touching the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bioelectrical signal 
recording device for recording an electrical signal of a 
living body, such as a electrocardiographic signal, an 
electroencephalographic signal or an electromyographic signal, 
and, more particularly, to a bioelectrical signal 
recording device which can move integrally with the living 
body and can record the electrical signal under the normal 
living conditions of the living body. A portable electrocardiograph which is one example of 
this kind of bioelectrical signal recording device is arranged 
in such a manner that its electrodes for taking out 
electrocardiographic signals are attached to corresponding 
measuring points on the body and a recorder is fixed to the 
waist by a belt, and the electrocardiographic signals taken 
out by the respective electrodes are recorded in the recorder. 
With such a bioelectrical signal recording device, it 
is possible to record the electrical signals under normal 
living conditions, for example, during an outdoor walk, an 
indoor meal or sleep. This record is greatly useful in diagnosing 
the disease of a patient. However, this conventional bioelectrical signal recording 
device has the problem that since it must be removed from  
 
the body during bathing, it is impossible to record electrical 
signals produced during bathing which causes great variations 
in the states of activities of the internal organs of 
the body, with the result that a partially insufficient diagnosis 
is made. The present invention has been made to solve the above-described 
problem (technical subject) of the prior art, and 
an object of the present invention is to provide a 
bioelectrical signal recording device capable of providing 
extremely real records not only during the above-described 
walk, meal or sleep but also even during bathing so that the 
exactness of the aforesaid diagnosis can be improved. To achieve the above object, the bioelectrical signal 
recording device according to the present invention includes 
a sheet-like base member having a flexibility which permits 
the base member to follow a motion of a living body and one 
face formed as a sticking face which serves to stick the base 
member on the living body, one or a plurality of electrodes 
provided on said face of the base member for picking up an 
electrical signal of the living body, and a recording element 
provided on the base member for recording the electrical signal 
picked up by the one or plurality of electrodes. The base 
member has a sufficient
