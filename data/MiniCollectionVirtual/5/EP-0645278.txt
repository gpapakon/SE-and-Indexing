<ABSTRACT>
A voltage V
B
 of a battery (16) is compared with a 
predetermined value V
max
 (100) and when the battery voltage V
B
 is 
lower than the predetermined value V
max
 as a result of the 

comparison, a state of charge (SOC) of the battery (16) is 
discriminated (104). In the case of an SOC of at least 70%, an 

output P
G
 of a generator (18) is controlled on the basis of an 
output P
M
 of a motor (10) (106 - 116), and in the case of an SOC 
of less than 70%, while the output P
G
 of the generator (18) is 
controlled to a relatively high value 
a
, the output P
M
 of the 
motor (10) is limited (120). When the SOC is restored to more 

than 75%, steps on and after 106 are executed. When the battery 
voltage V
B
 is at least the predetermined value V
max
, an idle 
control of an engine (22) is carried out (124). As a result, the 

SOC of the battery (16) can be ensured and overcharging of the 
battery (16) can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a controller of a generator
mounted on a hybrid vehicle and a control method for this
generator.As an electric vehicle, a so-called hybrid vehicle is well-known.
In the vehicle of this kind, an engine is provided in
addition to a motor as a driving source of the vehicle. For
example, in a series hybrid vehicle, while an output of a battery
such as a lead battery or the like mounted on the vehicle is
supplied to the motor as driving power, an output of a generator
driven by the engine is also supplied to this motor as the driving
power. In this case, the generator and the battery connected in
parallel are coupled with the motor and thus the battery can be
charged using the output of the generator. That is, even when the
battery is discharged during running of the vehicle, it is not
necessary to charge this battery using an external power source.
In other words, by driving the engine, the battery can be charged
using the output of the generator. Moreover, the driving power of
the motor can be supplied from not only the battery but also from the
generator, and the battery can be miniaturized. In the case of using the battery such as the lead battery or
the like mounted on the hybrid vehicle, by maintaining the state
of charge (SOC) of the battery at approximately 70 to 80%, the
life of the battery can be significantly extended. Hence, it is
preferable to control the SOC of the battery. As the controlling
means for the SOC of the battery, for instance, a field current of
a generator, that is, a generator output, is controlled to turn on
or off, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.Sho 57-202842.However, in such a battery SOC control by controlling the
generator output using the on/off control of the field current, it
is difficult to accurately control the SOC of the battery in a
predetermined range and to prevent overcharging. That is, simple
on/off control of the field current often causes the SOC to go out
of a target range and also causes overcharging of the battery in
certain cases.Further, when the motor is under heavy load, the generator
output and the power of the battery are used for driving the
motor. When this situation lasts for a long period of time, the
battery is discharged and its SOC is significantly reduced. This
SOC reduction brings about a short battery life. Furthermore, document DE 41 09 397 discloses a driving
arrangement for a vehicle consisting of an internal combustion
engine, an electric motor/generator coupled to the internal
combustion
