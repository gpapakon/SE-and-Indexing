<ABSTRACT>
For compensating weighing errors which are caused by the dependence of the value of the earth's gravitation on the erection location of the weighing scale, a matching device is provided in which numeric data about the geographic location of the erection location and its height above sea level are input by means of an input device (6). In response thereto, the matching device automatically determines the necessary correction of the weighing scale with respect to its calibration location on the basis of the known relationship between geographical location and value of the earth's gravitation.

Balance with a device (1) measuring the weight of a
mass to be weighed that is caused by the acceleration due

to gravity, a device (5) for deriving a value of the mass
corresponding to the measured weight as a function of a

value of the acceleration due to gravity corresponding to
a calibration site of the balance, and a device serving

to adapt the value of the mass corresponding to the
measured weight to the value of the acceleration due to

gravity at the site of deployment of the balance, said
device comprising an input device (6) into which input

values corresponding to geographical location values are
capable of being input and also a processing device (5)

connected to said input device which in response to each
such input value adapts the value of the acceleration due

to gravity serving as the basis for the derivation of the
value of the mass to the geographical location

corresponding to said input value, 
characterised in that

the input device is provided for the input of any
geographical location and altitude values and in that the

processing device (5) comprises a device calculating the
value of the acceleration due to gravity from a formula

determining the local dependence thereof in closed form
as a function of input values from the input device

directly representing the geographical latitude and the
altitude of the site of deployment.
Balance according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the input device comprises an input keyboard.
Balance according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the input device comprises an interface for the
connection of a satellite navigation receiver supplying

the geographical location values. 
Balance according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the satellite navigation receiver is integrated within
the balance.
