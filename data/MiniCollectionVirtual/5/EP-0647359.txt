<ABSTRACT>
A high gain antenna (20) that produces a pencil beam along the ground and a lower gain antenna (26) that produces a beam extending above the pencil beam are coupled to a source (2) of r.f. pulses so that the amplitude of the r.f. pulses applied to the high gain antenna (20) is less than the amplitude of the r.f. pulses applied to the lower gain antenna (26) during airplane detection and the full amplitude of the r.f. pulses during a pulse segment is applied to the high gain antenna (20) during wind pattern detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates, in general, to radar
systems and, more particularly, to an airport surveillance
radar (ASR) capable of microburst detection.Although wind gusts and air turbulence have long
been known to present hazards to aircraft during takeoff and
landing, attention has more recently been directed to rapid
changes in wind velocity known as wind shear. One
particularly hazardous form of wind shear can occur during
thunderstorm activity when cool upper air flows downward in
a column so as to create a pattern of radially outflowing
air when it strikes the ground. This phenomenon is known as
a microburst. When a low altitude aircraft passes through
this pattern, as might occur during takeoff or landing, it
successively encounters a head wind, a down draft, and a
tail wind. The abrupt switch from head wind to tail wind
causes the plane to lose air speed, and thus lift, which may
cause it to crash before effective corrective action can be
taken.At major airports, high powered search radars or
airport surveillance radars (ASR) are used for detecting the
location of aircraft, and special Terminal Doppler Weather
Radars (TDWR) are used for the purpose of detecting the
presence of dangerous wind patterns in the rain. Nearly all
commercial airports require the use of an ASR for air
traffic control. Unfortunately, however, the added weather
radars are beyond the financial reach of a large number of
smaller airports.Accordingly, efforts have been made to provide
added function to the existing search radar, ASR, so that it
can also detect dangerous wind patterns. U.S. Patent No. 
4,649,388 describes how special signal processing may be
added to an existing ASR to detect wind patterns such as a
microburst event. The ASR antenna has two medium gain,
vertically displaced, but overlapping beams in space.
Electromagnetic waves are radiated by the lower beam, and
the Doppler spectra of the received signals on both beams
are processed so as to generate signals synthetically
representing wind patterns occurring at low elevation.
Various modes of operation are suggested: substraction of
Doppler spectra related to the upper beam from the Doppler
spectra of the lower beam; determination of the ratio of
the spectra and derivation of their mean value. This
process can detect wet microburst events (those containing
a considerable amount of rain) but is inhibited from
detecting the equally dangerous dry microburst events
(those containing very little rain) by the instabilities of
the high power klystron transmitter.
