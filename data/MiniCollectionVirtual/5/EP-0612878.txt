<ABSTRACT>
A sieve-drum washing machine comprises a sieve drum (14) arranged in a housing (10) rotatably about a horizontal axis (16) and guide devices (46,48,64,66), by which a cloth web (40) is introduced in the upper housing region and, after running round the sieve drum (14), is discharged. The washing machine has, at the height of the liquor level (18) in the housing (10), at least one rotatable vane roller (28,30), parallel to the sieve drum (14), for throwing the liquor onto the cloth web.

Washing machine with a sieve drum, having a sieve 
drum (14) which is disposed in a casing (10) so as to be 

rotatable about a horizontal axis (16) and guide devices 
(46,48,64,66) by means of which a fabric strip (40) is 

introduced into, and, after rotation of the sieve drum (14), 
removed from, the upper area of the casing, characterised in 

that the washing machine comprises, at the level of the 
liquid surface (18) in the casing (10), at least one 

rotatable wing roller (28,30) which is located parallel to 
the sieve drum (14) for spinning the liquid onto the fabric 

strip, and in that the sieve drum comprises a cylinder (20) 
which is closed on the casing surface and on the front 

faces, on the circumferential surface of which cyllinder are 
formed ducts (26) with parallel axes, open at their ends, 

formed with the aid of webs (22) which are secured on the 
cylinder and have parallel axes and a cylindrical sieve (24) 

which encloses these. 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that the rotational axis (16) of 

the sieve drum (14) is substantially located at the level of 
the liquid surface (18) determined by an overflow (56), and 

in that the rotational axis of the wing roller(s) (28,30) 
is(are) substantially at the same height.  

 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to 
Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in the lower area of the 

casing (10) there is provided a trough (12) to accommodate 
the washing liquid (18), which trough follows, at a slight 

distance, the contour of the lower side of the sieve drum 
(14) and the wing roller(s) (28,30). 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to 
Claim 3, characterised in that the trough (12) is widened in 

the lower apex area to form a chamber (50) in which a direct 
or indirect heating device (52) is located. 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to 
Claim 4, characterised in that, on the outside of the trough 

(12), indirect heating devices (54) are provided. 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the wing 

roller(s) (28,30) is(are) turned towards the sieve drum (14) 
at its (their) upper side. 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that two dancing 

rollers (46,48) are provided in the casing (10) above the 
sieve drum (14), which maintain the entering and exiting 

fabric under constant tension. 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to one  
 

of the preceding Claims, characterised in that expander 
rollers (64,66) are located on the outer side of the casing 

(10) at the inlet and the outlet (42,44). 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to one 
of Claims 4 to 8, characterised in that a steam inflow pipe 

for direct heating opens into the chamber (50). 
Washing machine with a sieve drum according to one 
of Claims 2 to 9, characterised in that an intermediate 

chamber (68,70) is connected in front of or behind the 
overflow (56) and a corresponding inlet (60), and in that a 

direct or indirect heating device (72,74) is located in at 
least one of the intermediate chambers (68,70).
