<ABSTRACT>
A method for monitoring the status of a plating 
bath purification treatment cycle. The method involves 

applying a swept dc measurement signal to a pretreated 
electrode which is in contact with the plating solution, 

and monitoring the resultant response current signal. 

The electrode potential corresponding to the peak 
current density in the cathodic sweep of the response 

current signal provides an accurate indication of the 
status of the purification treatment cycle. The method 

tracks the progress of the purification process thereby 
ensuring the optimal termination points for the 

treatment process. The method can be used in 
conjunction with voltammetric plating bath analysis 

methods and equipment, as part of an overall plating 
bath monitoring and control system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plating bath
analysis methods. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a method for monitoring the status
of a plating bath purification treatment cycle.To ensure optimal performance of a plating bath,
the bath must be purified at regular intervals. The
purification serves to remove organic contaminants and
other impurities which can build up in the bath over
time and lead to undesirable plating characteristics.
In many cases, the contaminants are breakdown products
resulting from the electrochemical processes within the
bath. The time between purification treatments varies
depending upon the contaminant buildup rate, which is a
function of the nature and frequency of the plating bath
processes. For example, plating baths using organic
addition agents such as the acid copper plating bath
generate significant levels of contaminants and require
frequent purification.Carbon treatment is one widely used plating bath
purification technique. The carbon treatment process
involves contacting activated carbon with the plating
bath. The contaminants are adsorbed on the activated
carbon and thereby effectively removed from the plating
bath solution. The level of contaminants within the
bath is continually reduced during the purification
treatment, and when an acceptably low contaminant level
is attained, the treatment can be terminated. Fresh
addition agents are added to the treated bath and the
plating bath is ready for use again. On continued usage
organics and other contaminants will again begin to 
accumulate within the bath, and the purification
treatment will eventually have to be repeated. Since
the quality of the plating bath depends upon maintaining
a low level of contaminants, it is essential that the
carbon treatment cycles be initiated and terminated at
the appropriate times. The same concerns apply to other
plating bath purification techniques.Under current practice, the progress of the
purification treatment is typically monitored by
repeated manual tests on the plating bath solution. One
such manual test, disclosed in LeaRonal Application Note
No. AN30009CT, uses a Hull cell plating technique to
monitor carbon treatment. During the carbon treatment
process, an operator will run a Hull cell plating test
approximately once every three hours to determine when
the process is complete. Each Hull cell test is
performed at 2 amperes for 15 minutes with air
agitation. When the plated Hull cell panels appear
flat-matte across the entire current density range, the
