<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for cleaning an oil tank containing oil residues wherein the oil residues are fluidised by means of a fluidising agent and are discharged from the tank in liquid state and are separated into fractions, and wherein the fluidising agent primarily used is a portion of the oil residues discharged from the tank which, following purification and heating, is recycled to the tank and distributed by spraying above the layer of oil residues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for cleaning an oil tank 
containing oil residues while simultaneously exploiting said oil 
residues, wherein the oil residues are fluidised to form a liquid 
mixture and wherein the liquid mixture thus formed is discharged 
from said tank and subjected to a treatment to separate the mixture 
into fractions. During the storage of oil products, such as crude oil, fuel oil and 
other refined oils, in oil tanks a minor portion of the oil is 
precipitated. The precipitated material, the amount of which depends 
on the oil product type and origin, is deposited on the bottom and 
the sides of the oil tank and in time it will form a comparatively 
thick sludge layer in the tank. Especially in tanks used for the 
storage of crude oil the layer thus formed will contain components 
other than hydrocarbons. Thus, there may be considerable amounts of 
water, sand, loose rust and sludge present in the layer. When an oil tank containing such sludge layer has been emptied there 
is usually a water layer below said layer, and this water layer is 
discharged by pumping before the removal of the oil residue layer is 
initiated. The oil residue layer may be so solid that the removal 
thereof previously had to be carried out by manual or mechanical 
digging or by adding a major amount of another oil which was set in 
forceful motion by means of stirrers so as to suspend the oil 
portion of the sludge layer in said oil. This was done to facilitate 
the actual cleaning which was performed manually, optionally with 
mechanical assistance, e.g. by use of sludge extractors or the like 
equipment. US patent No. 5,085,242 discloses a method of the type described 
above. In this known method a heating medium is introduced below the 
liquid surface through a manhole in an oil storage tank, which 
heating medium is preferably immiscible with oil and is preferably 
water in such an amount and at such a temperature that the oil 
residue in the tank melts and a liquid layer consisting of a lower 
water phase and an upper oil phase is formed at the bottom of the 
tank.  
 The removal of oil is preferably effected by positioning a floating 
pump in the tank the inlet of said pump being located above the 
interface between the water phase and the oil phase. The oil is 
discharged by pumping through a second manhole in the oil tank and 
is introduced into a holding tank where heat is applied and it is 
stirred to prevent it from solidifying. While in the holding tank 
water is separated off before

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning and/or removing oil residues from an oil tank 
containing a layer of oil residues and converting said oil residues into 

a purified oil product, said method comprising fluidising the oil 
residues to form a liquid oil containing product, discharging said liquid 

oil containing product from the tank, purifying part of the discharged 
product to form a purified oil product, recycling another part thereof 

to the tank and distributing it within the tank in a zone located above 
the surface of the layer of oil residues, 
characterized
 in 
heating at least that part of the discharged product which is to be 

recycled to the tank to a temperature sufficiently high to fluidise the 
oil residues and in effecting the fluidisation of the oil residues 

contained in the tank mainly by means of said recycled hot liquefied 
sludge. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the part to be recycled is heated to a temperature of from 50 to 95°C and 

preferably from 65 to 90°C prior to recycling to the oil tank. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the part to be recycled is purified before it is heated and recycled to 

the oil tank. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the recycled part is sprayed above the surface of the oil residues at a 

pressure of below 25 bar. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that the cleaning of the oil tank with the 

recycled part is followed by rinsing with water. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that the recycled hot liquefied sludge is sprayed onto 

the sides as well as onto the bottom of the oil tank.  
 
A method according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in that 
the distribution is effected with rotatable nozzles which gradually 

change plane of rotation.
