<ABSTRACT>
The tool has a female mould (14), a male mould (54) and a one-piece diaphragm (20) arranged between them which is complementary to the outside of the container and has a radial swelling (24) with two opposite side pieces (26) for each handle. On the inside, the side pieces (26) each have a projection (28) to form a grip aperture in the handle. An adjusting device (40) presses the side pieces (26) together before the introduction of the material to be pressed into the tool and during the pressing process in such a way that the projections (28) adjoin. As a result, only a thin flash remains in the grip aperture which can easily be smoothed off. To remove the pressed handled container, the adjusting device (40) moves the side pieces (26) apart until the space between the projections (28) is wider than the handle.

A tool for isostatic molding of receptacles with
handles from pulverous or granular material, comprising a female

mold (14) and a male mold (54), as well as a one-piece
membrane (20) which is positioned between them and has a shape

complementary to the outside of the receptacle, being formed
for each handle with a radial bulge (24) having two mutually

opposed side portions (26) formed with projections (28) to
mold a holding hole in the handle, 
characterized
 in that an
adjusting device (40) is coordinated with the side portions

(26) and operable in such a way that, prior to introducing the
material to be compressed into the mold and during the pressing

operation, the projections (28) are located closely adjacent
each other and, after the pressing operation, they are

spaced from each other by a distance which is at least as
great as the greatest width of the molded handle.
The tool as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the adjusting device (40) comprises two mutually opposed

pressure chambers which are adapted to be pressurized so as to
press the projections (28) against each other before the membrane

(20) is pressurized for the isostatic molding.
The tool as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the adjusting device (40) comprises

piston and cylinder units (42).
The tool as claimed in claim 3, characterized in
that the piston and cylinder units (42) are operable to move

the projections (28) away from each other.
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that stiffening elements (30, 36, 38) are embedded

in the radial bulge (24) of the membrane (20). 
The tool as claimed in claim 5, characterized in
that the adjusting device (40) comprises a U-shaped stiffening

element (30) which has two resilient limbs (32) each embedded
in one of the side portions (26).
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the bulge (24) is extended radially outwardly

by stiffened portions (72) which are interconnected by
a fold (74) and, for molding a handle, adapted to be positioned

in close mutual contact radially outside of the handle.
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the mutual approaching of the side portions

(26) is limited in the upper area of the handle by a
support element (58) fastened to the male mold (54) and engaging

between the side portions (26), said support element being
formed integral with an additional membrane (56) associated

with the male mold (54) and adapted to be subjected to fluid
pressure at least in a zone behind the support element (58).
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the adjusting device (40) comprises

means (66, 70, 71) by which radially inwardly directed pressure
can be exerted on the bulge (24), following the compression,

while the projections (28) are being moved apart.
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the female mold (14) is subdivided in an

axial plane of symmetry of the or each bulge (24), and the resulting
female mold parts are movable towards and away from

each other by means of the adjusting device (40).
