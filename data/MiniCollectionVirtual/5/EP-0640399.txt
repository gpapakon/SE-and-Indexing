<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus and a method for controlling 
centrifugal separator, simulation is performed, in Steps 

S1 to S4, for the process before and after change of 
parameters as centrifugation condition. The results are 

compared in Step S10, and operation of the centrifugal 
separator is controlled in Step S11. To obtain the 

measured data of the specimen, an attachment for analysis 
15 is used, and the results are compared with the results 

of simulation, and parameters are corrected. To display 
the process in the middle of centrifugation, simulation 

is performed using the current parameters during 
operation of centrifugation, and the results are shown by 

graphic display on a display unit 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a centrifugal.
separator and a method for controlling the same, and in
particular to an apparatus and a method for performing
simulation of centrifugation.It is commonly practiced to determine the
condition for centrifugation when separating specimens in
the technique of centrifugation by adopting the
conditions described in the literature for separating
similar specimens or by finding out optimal condition on
trial and error basis.Centrifugation method is roughly divided into
differential centrifugation, density gradient
sedimentation velocity centrifugation, and density
gradient sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. Of
these methods, the differential centrifugation is a
method to collect the specimens as precipitates, and the
density gradient sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation
is a method to condense the specimens in a portion having 
the same density as that of the specimen particles in
density gradient. When centrifugation is performed by
these methods, the results of separation will not be
worsened due to excessive centrifugation time. In
contrast, the density gradient sedimentation velocity
centrifugation is to separate mixture of diverse specimen
particles piled up over density gradient liquid according
to the difference of sedimentation velocity between
components. If centrifugation time is too long, all of
the specimens are precipitated and cannot be separated.
Thus, special care should be taken in determining the
centrifugation time.In case the same apparatus as described in the
literature is not available or in case a new unknown
specimen is to be separated, there has been no other way
but to find out optimal condition on trial and error
basis by attempting to separate the substances to be
separated under various conditions as preliminary
experiment. Even when the condition of centrifugation
has been determined as the result of such trial and error,
the condition of separation had to be changed in case the
apparatus used in the past is not available or in case it
has been changed to an apparatus with higher efficiency.
Thus, a new condition had to be found again by trial and
error. For such preliminary experiment based on trial 
and error, extremely long time is required and high cost
is involved such as the use of expensive reagents, and
valuable biological specimens are often wasted.In recent years, attempts have been made on
simulation of centrifugation, in which separation
conditions of the specimens are estimated from
centrifugation condition
