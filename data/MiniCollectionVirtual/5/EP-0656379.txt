<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
preparation of polyurethane articles from uretonimine based
compositions, a polyurethane composition and molded
articles obtained thereby by RIM and spray molding.Polyurethane polymers prepared from an active
hydrogen-containing compound and an isocyanate are widely
employed in molding processes, particularly reaction
injection molding (hereinafter RIM) processes. RIM
articles are finding increased usage as automotive fascia.The basic polyurethane polymer systems are typically
based on an OH polyol component, an OH cross-linker and an
isocyanate component. However this system suffers from
long cream, demolding and cycle times, greatly increasing
the processing time. Modifications to the basic
polyurethane system to shorten these processing times has
been achieved through substitution of the OH cross-linker
with an aminic cross-linking system. Typically, 
thermosetting urethane polymer compositions comprise an
isocyanate component with an excess of isocyanate groups
and an aromatic diamine as a chain extender, to form a
polyurea-type urethane polymer. Optionally, the polymer
composition may also contain additional amounts of a
reactive polyol to form a hybrid urea-urethane polymer.
Such systems greatly decrease the cream and demolding
times, therefore enabling much shorter cycling times in a
RIM process.The use of chain extenders, such as di-alkyl aromatic
diamines, and more particularly di-ethyltoluene diamines
and di(alkylthio)aromatic diamines are often used with
isocyanate pre-polymers alone or with a polyol component to
form a hybrid polyurea/polyurethane molding RIM composition
(for example U.S. 4,595,742, 4,631,298, and 4,786,656).
While an increase in the flexural modulus is observed
through the addition of di-alkyl(thio)aromatic diamines,
these compositions are still limited with respect to
flexural modulus without observing "cold break" on
demolding. "Cold Break" is a brittleness observed in the
molded article during demolding. The presence of cold
break causes the molded article to fracture on demolding.
When trying to achieve a higher flexural modulus, to above
80,000 psi, by increasing the isocyanate content of the
isocyanate component (i.e. higher % NCO), these materials
suffer "cold break". Alternatively attempts to increase 
the flexural modulus by increasing the functionality of the
polyol component also suffers from "cold break".
Accordingly, efforts to increase the flexural modulus while
preventing "cold break" is an on going area of
