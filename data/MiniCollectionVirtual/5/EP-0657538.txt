<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process to produce 
engineered antibodies in plants, antibodies and the use 
thereof for diagnostics and therapeutics. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
process to produce single chain antibodies in 
transgenic plants to be used for diagnostics and 
therapeutics. The production of antibodies to be used in 
diagnostics and therapeutics is of great importance for 
either basic or applied research in molecular 
pathology, clinical immunology, etc. A significant requirement of the field consists 
of finding systems of antibody production that are able 
to maintain proper specificity, effectiveness and 
pharmakinetics characteristics, being at the same time 
alternative processes to classic monoclonal antibody 
production, because of the very restricted use of said 
antibodies on large scale. Recently, biotechnology research discovered 
that different biologic systems (such as bacteria, 
fungi, cultured animal cells and transgenic animals) 
could be used to optimize the production and/or the 
purification of organic molecules and/or proteins. By 
means of either recombinant DNA or genetic and protein 
engineering techniques, as well as the more advanced 
(recombinant and/or engineered) antibody technique, DNA 
sequences could be expressed in a biological context 
other than the natural one. Ward and al. (1) found that an antibody single 
domain, named dAbs (Variable Single Heavy Region), 
obtained in E. coli, maintained the ability to 
recognize the antigen.  Hiatt and al. (2, 3) demonstrated that murine 
entire antibodies could be produced in plants. Even if a number of specific literature was 
published, it is universally reported that both 
monoclonal and engineered (4) and dispecific antibodies 
(5) cannot be used effectively in an in vivo therapy. 
Specifically, typical drawbacks are as follows: a) 
local and/or general adverse reactions, due to the 
parenteral administration of murine antibodies or 
enzyme fragments thereof; b) the risk to transmit some 
pathogen agent, using compositions obtained from animal 
cells (hybridomas) (6); c) prohibitive costs of large 
scale antibody administration (up to some ten or 
hundred gram for each therapy cycle); d) the more and 
more limiting government rules relating to the use of 
the experimental animals; and e) the poor feasibility 
of antibody fragmenting, deriving, etc. processes when 
using conventional biochemical methods. In order to ovrecome these problems, the 
genetic engineering and the innovative antibody
