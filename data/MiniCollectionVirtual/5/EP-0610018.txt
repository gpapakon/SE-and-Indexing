<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a contacts material for a
vacuum valve with improved breaking performance.Apart from the fundamental three performance
requirements: anti-welding property, voltage withstanding
capability and current interrupting property, the
characteristics required for contacts materials for vacuum
valves include as important requirements a low and stable
temperature rise and a low and stable contacts resistance.
However, some of these requirements are mutually
antagonistic, so it is difficult to satisfy all the
requirements by a single metal. In the many known contacts
materials they have therefore been developed by combining two or more
elements so as to mutually complement the deficiencies of each
others' performance, and to meet specific applications 
such as large current use or high withstanding voltage use,
and they have excellent characteristics in their own way.
However, their performance under increasingly severe
requirements still requires improvement.For example, in contacts materials for the vacuum valve
for general-use circuit breakers, in initial development of
vacuum valves, anti-welding property was emphasized. It was
therefore the practice to add a welding preventing
constituent such as Te or Bi in an amount of not more than
10 weight %, with Cu as main constituent (see for example
issued Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) Nos. Sho. 41-12131,
Sho. 44-23751). However, with demands such as
increasing field of use, miniaturisation and price reduction
of vacuum circuit breakers and vacuum valves, contacts
having breaking performance better than that of the
conventional Cu-Te or Cu-Bi contacts were required. As a
result, Cu-Cr contacts, which have better breaking
performance than conventional contacts, have come to be the
most common.EP-0110176 has a contact material which includes copper
as the main conductive component together with chromium (35%
by weight or less) and tantalum (50% by weight or less).
The total quantity of chromium and tantalum being 10% by
weight or more.EP-0101024 discloses contact materials wherein the main
conductive component is copper (20-70% weight percent)
together with molybdenum (5-70 weight percent) and chromium
(5-70 weight percent).EP-0109088 discloses contact materials wherein copper
is used as the basic conductive component. The material
further comprises chromium (35% by weight or less) and
niobium (40% by weight or less). The total of chromium and 
niobium is 10% by weight or more. Nevertheless, the
present situation is that contacts
