<ABSTRACT>
A liquid scintillation medium for homogeneous flow systems which 
comprises solvent, fluor and optionally surfactant, wherein said 

solvent comprises benzyltoluene. The solvent may comprise the 
positional isomers of benzyltoluene, and other solvents such as 

diphenylethane. This new solvent system for use in flow-through 
scintillation counting is characterized by low viscosity, high 

flash point and low vapour pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of liquid scintillation 
counting in flow systems, e.g. radioactive flow detection in the 
eluate of a High Pressure (or Performance) Liquid Chromatography 
(HPLC) column. More in particular, the invention relates to new liquid 
scintillation media that are specially well suited for use in 
radioactive flow detectors used in, e.g., Radio-HPLC equipment. Traditional Liquid Chromatography, High Performance 
Liquid Chromatography or paper chromatography can be used to 
separate mixtures of radio-labelled compounds. This results 
in the isolation of different fractions whose radioactivity 
can be measured by mixing an aliquot with about two to four 
times its volume of scintillation liquid (generally referred 
to as a "scintillation cocktail") and thereafter counting 
light events produced by the radioactivity of the fraction. 
Thus liquid scintillation counting is known to be useful for 
measuring the concentration of a radio-labelled species in a 
sample or fraction. Liquid chromatography has long been known to be a capable 
technique for the separation and analysis of multi-component 
mixtures. However HPLC has now progressed to be the method of 
choice for the quantitation of components which could be 
thermally unstable and non-volatile. This progress can be 
attributed to improvements to and development of chemically 
bonded stationary phases. Also solvent programming (gradient 
elution) is now commonplace in HPLC. In normal bonded phase  
 
chromatography the stationary phase is polar (e.g. Silica) and 
the mobile phase (elution solvent) is non-polar. In this case 
the non-polar species in the mixture elute first due to their 
preference for the mobile phase (i.e. exhibit lower retention). 
With reversed phase chromatography the stationary phase is non-polar 
(Octadecyl Silica) and the mobile phase is polar. The 
elution order may be the reverse observed with normal bonded 
phase chromatography. Thus it can be seen that HPLC is an 
effective method for the separation of multi-component mixtures 
containing radio-labelled species. Liquid scintillation counting is widely utilised to analyze 
samples containing radioactively labelled substances. Typically 
a sample in solution is mixed with a liquid scintillation 
cocktail and the light events produced from the sample and 
cocktail mixture are detected according to their energy and 
number of events. The light events occur when the energy of the 
particles, emitted form the radioactive isotope component of the 
sample in
