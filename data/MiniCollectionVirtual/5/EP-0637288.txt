<ABSTRACT>
The invention has as an object to detect a deceleration or acceleration of an automotive vehicle, occuring as a consequence of a collision in motorised traffic, said automotive vehicle being provided with an installation according to the invention, said detection being made by means of this installation and thus causing automatic activation of the alarm light installation, present on the automative vehicle, and thus without any action in that respect by the driver, this with the intention of drawing the attention of the other participants in the traffic as soon as possible to the dangerous traffic condition caused.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic mechanical 
device for automotive vehicles in order to actuate automatically 
the alarm light installation as presently installed 
in substantially all automotive vehicles without any action 
of the driver. This is the more important since on many 
occasions the driver will not be in a condition to take any 
action after a crash, either for a short time, being in a 
temporary shock condition, for considerable time, being 
seriously injured but after considerable time still able to 
act, or permanently being unconscious or dead. The so-called delay-switches are known, such as a 
switch, presented in Dutch patent application 66.16240, 
which signals the standstill of an automotive vehicle, as 
well as the switch described in German patent specification 
900.658, which also signals exclusively the standstill of 
an automotive vehicle. FR-A-2.160.252 describes a device for registering 
a collision of an automotive vehicle by detecting the 
occurrence of the resulting extraoridinary deceleration or 
acceleration by means of a sensor system causing automatic 
activation of a lights installation such as a stop light 
and/or a back light. This sensor system is however unidirectional. Similarly US-A-4.849.655 describes a device for 
detecting the occurrence of an extraoridinary deceleration 
or acceleration by means of an automotive vehicle by means 
of a sensor system, comprising a sensor unit provided with 
a deflectable spring fixed at one end to a housing whereas 
at the other end a permanent magnet is mounted with a so-called 
Hall effect sensor underneath said magnet. This 
sensor system is as well unidirectional. Apart from the above, various types of signalliung 
systems are known from the process industry, but there is 
nowhere any reason of a signalling system as presented by 
the device according to the present invention. There is a need for a device that warns the other  
 
traffic participants immediately for the dangerous situation 
arising from a crash involving one or more automotive 
vehicles, without any action by the driver being required. It is thus an object of the invention to provide a 
solution to restrict drastically the number of people 
concerned in the follow-up of a crash. To achieve that object the invention provides a 
device for registering a collision of an automotive vehicle 
whereby, if the automotive vehicle is involved in a collision 
a detection will occur of the resulting extraordinary 
deceleration or acceleration by means of a sensor
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for registering a collision of an automotive 
vehicle whereby, if the automotive vehicle is involved 

in a collision a detection will occur of the resulting 
extraordinary deceleration or acceleration by means of a 

sensor system, comprising a sensor unit, causing automatic 
activation of the alarm lights installation as present on 

the automotive vehicle, 
characterised in that
 said sensor 
unit is provided by a closed(tight) helical spring (6) or a resilient 

rod 
fixed vertically at one end to a housing (9), whereas being 

deflectable in each direction at the other end, where a 
permanent magnet (7) is mounted; a so-called Hall effect 

sensor (8) being positioned underneath magnet (7). 
A device according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the activation as realised automatically is maintained 
for a predetermined period of time, and will be switched 

back automatically by a timer (4') after said period of 
time into the original position as prior to the collision. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the activation resulting therefrom can be reset 
into the original position as prior to the collision by 

means of a manual switch (4). 
An automotive vehicle comprising a device for 
registering a collision of an automotive vehicle, 
characterised 
in that
 said device is a device acccording to any one 
of claims 1 to 3.
