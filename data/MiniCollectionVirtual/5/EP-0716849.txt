<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic or dermatological compsns. contg. a mixt. of at least one type-III ceramide (I) and at least one type-V ceramide (II), where (I) is in the form of a single stereoisomer, are new. Also claimed is a process for lowering the m.pt. of at least one type-II (sic) ceramide in the form of a single stereoisomer, comprising mixing it with at least one type-V ceramide.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic or dermatological composition
containing a mixture of at least one type-III ceramide

in the form of a single stereoisomer and of at least
one type-V ceramide of synthesis.
Composition according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the mixture is a mixture of at

least one type-III ceramide, of at least one type-V
ceramide of synthesis and of at least one type-II

ceramide of synthesis.
Composition according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the ceramides, other than

type-III ceramides, are present in an amount which is
sufficient to lower the melting point of the mixture to

a temperature below 90°C.
Composition according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the ceramides correspond to

the following formula (I):


where A represents -CH
2
-,


or
-CH=CH-; 


R
1
 represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or
branched, C
10
 to C
26
 alkyl chain;
R
2
 represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or
branched, C
12
 to C
36
 alkyl chain;
R
3
 represents H or -CO-CHOH-R
2
;
n represents 0 or 1.
Composition according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the ceramide mixture

contains 20 % by weight of type-III ceramide, 40 % by
weight of type-V ceramide and 40 % by weight of type-II

ceramide, with respect to the total weight of the composition.
Composition according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that the type-II ceramide is N-oleoyldihydrosphingosine.
Composition according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the type-V ceramide is

N-(α-hydroxypalmitoyl)dihydrosphingosine.
Composition according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the type-III ceramide is N-stearoylphytosphingosine.
Use of the cosmetic composition according to
one of the preceding claims for moisturizing the skin,

methods for treatment of the human body by therapy
being excluded.
Use of the composition according to any one of
Claims 1 to 8 for preparing a salve or an ointment

intended for the therapeutic treatment of dry skins.
Process for the cosmetic treatment of the skin,
characterized in that it consists in applying a composition

according to any one of Claims 1 to 8 to the skin.
Process for lowering the melting point of at
least one type-III ceramide in the form of a single

stereoisomer which consists in mixing at least one type-V
ceramide with this ceramide. 
Process according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the ceramides, other than type-III ceramides, are

present in an amount which is sufficient to lower the
melting point of the mixture to a temperature of less

than 90°C and better less than 85°C.
