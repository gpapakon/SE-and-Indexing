<ABSTRACT>
The invention proceeds from an electronic alarm timepiece (clock, watch) which in each case after its alarm signal has been switched off by the user already prepares to output an alarm signal occurring 24 hours later, without the user having to undertake further measures. According to the invention, the timepiece is equipped with an additional device (1) by means of which the user is enabled to jump to the next alarm signal which has been prepared, and which controls a display device (7) in such a way that the user is informed of the alarm signal sequence to be expected.

<CLAIMS>
An electronic clock with a time-keeping
register, a further register in which the user may enter

an alarm time, with a switching module (1) issuing an
alarm signal when an electrical signal (2) resides at its

input on account of coincidence of the time of day with
the alarm time, and with a switch (3) cooperating with

the switching module (1) in such fashion that the latter
turns off the alarm signal in the event of the switch (3)

being actuated during the issuance of the alarm signal,
while on the other hand preparing the switching module

(1) to deliver the next alarm signal to be issued at the
entered alarm time,
characterized in that
 on its input side the switching
module (1) is connected to an additional device (4)

capable of being selectively activated and deactivated by
the user of the clock, that the switching module (1),

with the additional device (4) activated, skips only the
next prepared alarm signal, while the additional device

(4) in its deactivated condition exerts no influence on
the mode of operation of the switching module (1), and

that the respective condition of the additional device
(4) is output on an indicating device (7). 
The electronic clock as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the additional device (4) is comprised
of a memory assuming two different values, whereof

the one value is representative of the activated condition
and the other value is representative of the deactivated

condition, that the switching module (1) is comprised
of an alarm signal generator (5) and a time delay

module (6) which is capable of preparing an alarm signal
following, for example, 24 hours later by feeding its

output signal to the memory with a time delay relative to
its input signal, setting the memory value such that an

alarm signal can be issued again after 24 hours.
The electronic clock as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that
 the switch (3) is configured as a
push-button switch and that its actuation enables the

alarm signal generator (5) to be switched for the purpose
of deactivating the alarm signal, in addition to enabling

the memory to be switched continuously between its memory
values indicative of the activated and deactivated conditions.
The electronic clock as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the indicating device (7) operates
with visual means, and that as status indicator for the

additional device (4) only a single symbol is utilized
which either flashes or is made visible continuously.
