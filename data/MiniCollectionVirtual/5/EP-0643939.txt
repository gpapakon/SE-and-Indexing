<ABSTRACT>
The shower-bath basin comprises a first portion (6) 
which is shaped to include a concave zone (4) that is 

delimitated by a peripheral edge (3). Said first portion 
is arranged upon and joined to a second portion (7) which 

is shaped to include an upper peripheral fascia (8) 
adapted to support said edge (3) and blending into a 

floor-mount base (10) of said second portion (7). Said 
floor-mount base (10) comprises a plurality of 

alternately concave and convex sections having respective 
lower surfaces (11), which constitute an area for the 

basin to rest upon the floor, and upper surfaces (12), 
which are adapted to support said first portion (6) of 

the basin in correspondence of the bottom of said concave 
zone (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved type of shower-bath
basin and, particularly, to a basin for a shower-bath
booth of the self-bearing or self-supporting type.As contrary to traditional shower-bath basins, which
are usually made of a ceramic material and are therefore
quite expensive, and which additionally require masonry
work to be performed for their installation, self-bearing
shower-bath booths are known to be generally provided
with a substantially monolithic structure which mainly
comprises a metal framework, with blind walls and
semitransparent doors, as well as a shower basin of a
rigid material which is attached to the metal framework
of the booth and is installed at a certain height above
the floor. In particular, the periphery of the basin is
supported by the floor through a plurality of upright
members equipped with resting feet; for a greater
structural strength, said upright members shall
additionally be interconnected and fastened together by
means of appropriate brackets or similar strengthening or
stiffening means. Furthermore, due to a number of both 
sanitary and aesthetic considerations, the space which is
comprised between the floor and the basin must be
concealed by means of bottom side panels reaching down to
the floor (according to the shape and the type of
installation of the shower booth), which are generally
made of metal and are fixed in their position by screwing
or snap-fitting them on the remaining structure of the
shower booth which thus takes the afore cited self-bearing,
monolithic appearance. It goes without saying
that also this assembly of said bottom side panels, which
anyway are unable to ensure a satifactory full-height
sealing, requires the use of appropriate fastening and/or
hook-on means.Such solutions are obviously quite complicated from a
construction point of view and, for their installation,
they require difficult and toilsome work that must be
performed by skilled personnel. As a consequence, these
solutions are ultimately also undesirably expensive.From LU-A-56 384 a bathtub is also known including a
concave portion fixed, for instance by welding, to a
support base which is shaped with a plurality of
alternately concave and convex sections having respective
lower surfaces, which constitute an area resting on the
floor, and upper surfaces which support the bottom of
said concave portion. An isolating layer may be
interposed between the support base and the concave
portion for heat and sound insulating purposes.It is therefore a purpose of the present
