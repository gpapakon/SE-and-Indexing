<CLAIMS>
Seat-valve style pressure-relief valve, having a 
spring-means-loaded valve member (18, 18a to 18c, 21a, 

21b), which prevents a pressure-medium flow from an 
outflow (14, 14a to 14c) to an inflow (13, 13a to 13c) 

and, whenever a predefined pressure is exceeded, releases 
a pressure-medium flow from the inflow to the outflow, 

the valve member interacting with a diaphragm (21, 21a to 
21c) which is clamped in place by its rim, characterized 

in that the diaphragm (21, 21a to 21c) forms the spring 
means, bears against a stop face (21, 21a to 21c) whenever 

a predefined maximum pressure is exceeded and bears, 
in the region of the clamping point, upon a sealing ring 

(20, 20a to 20c), and in that the pretensioning of the 
diaphragm (21, 21a to 21c) can be altered by an adjusting 

means (22, 22a to 22c). 
Pressure-relief valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the diaphragm (21a), on the side 

facing away from the valve seat (17a), bears against a 
spring washer (53). 
Pressure-relief valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the diaphragm (21b), on the side 

facing away from the valve seat, is loaded by a compression 
spring (54). 
Pressure-relief valve according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that a part of the diaphragm 

(21a, 21b) forms the valve member. 
Pressure-relief valve according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the valve member (18, 18c) 

is a ball valve.  
 
Pressure-relief valve according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the valve member is of at 

least partially conical construction. 
Pressure-relief valve according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that a pressure in the inflow 

(13, 13a to 13c) and a pressure in the outflow (14, 14a 
to 14c) act upon the diaphragm (21, 21a to 21c) on the 

same side. 
Pressure-relief valve according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that between the diaphragm (21c) 

and the valve member (18c) there is disposed a further 
spring means (63).
