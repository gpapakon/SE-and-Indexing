<ABSTRACT>
Method of cheese production on the basis of ultrafiltration-concentrated milk, wherein acidified and pasteurized retentate is optionally added to the retentate from the ultrafiltrated milk, which is acidified with at least one starter culture to obtain a pH-value of from 4.5 to 5.6, whereupon salt and optionally other additives are added and the retentate is, while supplying cheese rennet, pumped into cheese moulds or ready-made packages wherein the cheese receives final treatment under heat treatment at from 18 to 65  DEG C for a period of from 4 to 36 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing cheese on the 
basis of ultrafiltration-concentrated milk and cheese produced by 
the method. A commonly used method of cheese production on the basis of 
ultrafiltration-concentrated milk consists in the addition of 
starter culture to obtain a pH-value of about 6 followed by addition 
of rennet, preferably chymosin, whereupon the cheese milk still in 
its fluid state is dosed into moulds or directly into tins. After 
coagulation and final acidification salt in its dry state is added. 
Depending on the size of the cheese, an acceptable salt distribution 
is obtained within about nine days and nights, but the salt diffusion 
may take up to 42 days and nights. In the method described in AU-B-32175/84 concentrated cheese milk is 
admixed with usual additives, including sodium chloride and rennet, 
and acidogene in the form of glucono-delta-lacton (GDL), which 
gradually acidify the milk by cleaving off hydrolytically glyconic 
acid, following which the cheese milk, still in its fluid state, is 
dosed into individual packages. Renning, acidification and 
coagulation are effected after a few hours in the packaging. In this 
method 3.5% of non-milk additives in the form of GDL or other 
non-bacterial acidogenes are used. The chemical non-bacterial 
acidification of the cheese provides no ripening, i.e. no 
development of flavours, with enzymes from starter culture. Here the 
ripening is dictated solely by rennet enzyme and fat decomposition, 
the latter being intensified by homogenisation of the cheese milk 
both prior to and following concentration. US-A-4268528 discloses a method of the production of cheese wherein 
a mixture of a whole-milk ultrafiltration-retentate and an 
ultrafiltration-retentate of a lactic acid-fermented milk having a 
pH-value ≤ 4.4 is cooled to between 0 and 4°C during stirring to 
resuspend flocculated casein, is heated to above 4°C and rennet is 
added following which the casein coagulates. Acidification of the 
milk prior to the ultrafiltration results in more calcium being 
filtered off as the amount of dissolved calcium is higher at a low  
 
pH-value. Acidification of milk to a pH-value of about 4.6, which is 
the isoelectrical point of the casein, usually effects flocculation 
which impairs a subsequent rennet coagulation. In the method 
described the flocculated casein is resuspended and normal rennet 
coagulation is obtained. In a normal continuous cheese production where the still fluid 
cheese curd is poured into

A method of cheese production on the basis of ultrafiltration-concentrated 
milk comprising optionally adding acidified retentate 

which is subsequently pasteurized to the retentate from the ultrafiltrated 
milk, acidifying the mixture with at least one starter 

culture to obtain a pH-value of from 4.5 to 5.6, whereupon salt and 
optionally other additives are added in the desired concentration, 

and pumping the retentate, while supplying rennet, into cheese 
moulds or ready-made packages, characterised in that the cheese is 

subjected to a final treatment in said cheese moulds or ready-made 
packages under heat treatment at from 18 to 65°C for a period of 

from 4 to 36 hours. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that the acidified retentate which is subsequently pasteurized is 

acidified with impure bacteria cultures having a known taste 
character (bacteria from non-pasteurized milk, local cheese specialities or whey 

from the previous day's cheese production). 
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in 
that the acidified retentate has a pH-value of from 3.2 to 5.0 and 

is added to obtain a pH-value of above 6 in the mixture and that the 
mixture is subsequently pasteurized prior to acidification. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that, following acidifica

made of the permeate from ultrafiltrated milk, 

wherein protein and optionally fat components are 
enriched, and which is inoculated with at least one bacteria culture 

and fermented under simultaneous neutralization of the acid formed 
and subsequently purified of bacteria. 
A method according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in 
that the taste concentrate is added in an amount of from 3 to 9%.

characterized
 in 
that acidified, salted retentate is stirred into the heat treated 

cheese whereupon rennet addition and heat treatment are effected as 
in claim 1.
