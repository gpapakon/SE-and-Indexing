<ABSTRACT>
A buried collector layer (2) is formed on a semiconductor
substrate (1). An epitaxial layer (4) is formed on the buried

collector layer (2). A plurality of element separating trenches (11)
of roughly the same depth and filled with an insulating

material are formed in the epitaxial layer (4). When these
trenches are formed deep enough to penetrate the buried

collector layer to the semiconductor substrate, an impurity
region of conductivity the same as that of the buried

collector layer is formed at a predetermined position of the
semiconductor substrate and adjoining to at least one bottom

portion of a plurality of the trenches. Further, when a
separation layer is formed on the semiconductor substrate and

adjoining to the buried collector layer to separate the
semiconductor device from another adjacent semiconductor

device, at least one of a plurality of trenches is formed on
a boundary surface between the buried collector layer and the

separation layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device 
of trench-dependent element separation structure and a method 
of manufacturing the same device. Recently, in order to increase the integration rate of 
bipolar transistors and to decrease the parasitic capacity of 
the bipolar transistors for obtaining higher performance, 
trench-dependent element separation structure is widely 
adopted to separate the bipolar transistor elements 
effectively. Figs. 1 and 2 are cross-sectional views showing 
prior art bipolar transistors of trench-dependent element 
separation structure. In the bipolar transistor shown in Fig. 
1, an epitaxial layer 4 and a buried collector layer 2 are 
formed on a semiconductor substrate 1. Further, two deep 
trenches 11a and 11b of the same depth are formed penetrating 
these layers 4 and 2, respectively. These trenches 11a and 
11b are all buried with insulating material to perfectly 
separate the bipolar transistors from each other. In this 
case, the space required for separating the elements can be 
narrowed as compared with the conventional PN junction. 
Further, in the transistor region, another trench 11c 
shallower than the trenches 11a and 11b is formed penetrating 
only the epitaxial layer 4 (without penetrating the buried 
collector layer 2), and the trench 11c is also buried with 
insulating material to suppress the operation in the lateral 
direction and further to reduce a parasitic capacitance formed 
between a base region 22 and a buried collector lead layer 20. 
Therefore, since the parasitic capacitance can be reduced 
markedly by use of the trench-dependent element separation, 
it is possible to improve the transistor performance.  
 
Further, in Fig. 1, an emitter region 24 is formed in the base 
region 22. A base lead electrode 26 is formed at the base 
region 22, and an emitter lead electrode 30 is formed at the 
emitter region 24. Further, the reference numeral 28 denotes 
an insulating layer; 42 denotes an interlayer insulating film; 
and 44 denotes aluminum electrodes 44a, 44b and 44c, 
respectively. On the other hand, it is preferable to adopt LOCOS 
(localized oxidation of silicon) technique to separate the 
broad bipolar transistor regions from each other. Therefore, 
Fig. 2 shows the bipolar transistor, in which the element 
separation region 13 is formed in accordance with the LOCOS 
technique. In this case, being different from the case shown 
in Fig. 1, it is unnecessary to farm two sorts of trenches of 
different depths. In either case, the
