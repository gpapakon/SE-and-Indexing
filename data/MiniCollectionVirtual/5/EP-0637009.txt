horizontal and vertical resolutions and is capable of 

displaying a high-quality image free from flicker is 
provided. Pixels of each color are arranged in a delta 

form, color selected from the pixels of each color is 
connected to a column data line, at least one memory circuit 

is disposed in correspondence with the selected color, and 
image information is supplied to each pixel in such a way 

that the image information is distributed to the upper and 
lower portions of the column data line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid-crystal
display apparatus and a method of driving the same liquid-crystal
display apparatus. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a liquid-crystal display apparatus
which is capable of displaying a high-quality image and a
method of driving the same liquid-crystal display apparatus.In recent years, liquid-crystal display apparatuses
which can be formed into thin apparatuses as display
elements and which use liquid-crystal display elements which
consume a small amount of power have come to be increasingly
practical.An explanation will be given below of a color liquid-crystal
display apparatus and a method of driving the same
liquid-crystal display apparatus with reference to the
drawings.Fig. 1(a) is a schematic block diagram illustrating an 
example of a color liquid-crystal display apparatus, and
Fig. 1(b) is a schematic view illustrating the color
arrangement of a filter thereof. In Figs. 1(a) and 1(b),
reference numeral 10 denotes a liquid-crystal display
element; reference numeral 11 denotes a switching
transistor, such as a thin film transistor (TFT), in which
amorphous silicon or polysilicon is used in a semiconductor
layer; reference numeral 12 denotes a pixel electrode;
reference numeral 13 denotes a row control line; reference
numeral 14 denotes a column control line; reference numeral
20 denotes a vertical scanning circuit (V·SR); reference
numeral 30 denotes a horizontal scanning circuit (H·SR);
reference numeral 40 denotes a signal processing circuit;
and reference numeral 50 denotes a control circuit. In a
filter 15 shown in Fig. 1(b), R designates red, G designates
green, and B designates blue. This filter 15 corresponds to
the pixel electrode 12 in this order of color arrangement.As shown in Fig. 1(a), the liquid-crystal display
element 10 has switching transistors 11 for each pixel. The
switching transistors have a great number of pixels such
that the source (or drain) is connected to the column data
line 14, the drain (or source) is connected to the pixel
electrode 12, and the gate is connected to row control line
13. The pixel electrodes 12 are arranged in horizontal and
vertical lines, and in correspondence with this arrangement, 
the colors in the filter 15 are arranged in horizontal and
vertical lines.The row control lines 13 are each connected to the
vertical scanning circuit 20, and the column control lines
14 are each connected to the horizontal scanning circuit 30.
A signal from the control circuit 50 is input to each of
