<ABSTRACT>
A rotor for a miniature electric motor has a commutator and an armature mounted on 
a shaft 11. The commutator has a plurality of armature laminations including two end 

laminations 30, stacked together on the shaft 11 to form an armature core 12 having a 
plurality of poles 33 and an armature winding wound around the poles 33 and 

terminated on the commutator. The two end laminations 30 each have means for 
balancing the rotor in the form of projections 31 extending from adjacent the radially 

outer periphery 34 of the armature core 12. The rotor is balanced by bending or 
deforming radially selected projections 31 or parts thereof. The projections 31 may be 

divided into a number of fingers 36 to assist balancing. The desired degree of balance 
is achieved by bending selected projections 31 or parts thereof radially.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotor for a miniature motor and in particular to a 
rotor incorporating means for balancing the rotor. Known rotors for electric motors comprise a shaft and a stack of armature laminations 
mounted on the shaft and forming armature poles. Armature windings are wound 
around the armature poles and are connected to a commutator mounted on the shaft 
adjacent one end of the armature stack. Balancing of the rotor after assembly has 
normally been by one of two methods, either material such as an epoxy putty is added 
to the rotor generally on the windings to balance the rotor or material is removed from 
the radially outer peripheral surface of the armature stack using a cutting wheel. The 
material adding method is labour intensive while the material removing method can be 
automated. One major problem with the material removal method is that for miniature motors, the 
amount of material to be removed to achieve balance is often minute and even if 
cutting wheels with a width of 1/8'' (3 mm) are used, they cannot be accurately 
controlled to remove such small amounts of material to achieve the desired degree of 
balance. It is the purpose of the present invention to at least reduce the disadvantages of known 
methods of balancing rotors for miniature motors by providing a rotor incorporating 
balancing means. The balancing means avoids the need to add material to the rotor to 
balance the rotor or to grind or machine the rotor to remove material to balance the 
rotor. This is achieved by providing a rotor in which the balancing means comprises each end 
lamination of the armature stack having peripheral portions extending from adjacent 
the radially outer periphery and arranged to be bent radially to balance the rotor. In the days when steel was expensive and labour was cheap, there was a technique 
used to make the rotor appear to be longer. This involved the use of axially extending 
projections formed on the end laminations adjacent the radially outer peripheral surface 
of the armature core. These projections were called flux collectors and they acted to 
improve the magnetic coupling between the magnets and the armature core. These  
 
flux collectors were rigid and arranged to be spaced from the field magnets by a small 
air gap, the smaller the gap, the better the performance. The present invention, in a simple embodiment, looks similar to the old flux rings but 
the purpose of the axially extending projections on the end laminations is to provide a 
convenient and
