<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette for a tape recording and reproducing 
apparatus having a cassette holder with an erroneous insertion 

preventing member. The cassette has a rectangular case 
having front and rear portions longer than a side portion, 

and has a loading pocket extending along the front portion, 
a magnetic tape wound on a pair of reels and extended along 

the loading pocket, a front lid provided at the front 
portion to cover the tape, an erroneous insertion preventing 

slot communicated to the loading pocket at a bottom of the 
case. The slot is extended to allow a normal insertion of 

the cassette, with the front lid being forward, into the 
holder engaging with the erroneous insertion preventing 

member. An escaping slot is provided on the bottom of the 
case nearby the rear portion leaving a slight space 

therefrom. The escaping slot is disposed along an erroneous 
insertion direction of the cassette for allowing the 

erroneous insertion of the cassette, with the rear portion 
being forward, into the holder by causing the detecting 

member to be inserted into the escaping slot after a wall of 
the rear portion overrides the detecting member with the 

further erroneous insertion of the tape cassette into the 
holder.
