<CLAIMS>
rotor-type pump with the following features: 

a cam ring (7) is located in a housing (8, 8A); 
a rotor (2) with radially sliding valves secured to an input 
shaft (1) turns in the cam ring (7); 
working chambers (12) between the radially sliding valves 
are axially bordered by face plates (5, 6); 
oil is supplied and removed via suction and discharge zones; 
the discharge zones contain several outlet openings (22, 
22A) which are covered by a reed-type valve device (23) to 

prevent oil already supplied from flowing back when the 
working chambers are only partly filled; 
the internal radial faces of the working chambers are 
pressurized by outlet pressure; 
the oil supply to the operating chambers is limited by 
cross-sectional narrowings (restriction holes 31 and 31A), 
 
characterized by the following features: 


the rotor-type pump is of vane pump design, and 
between the vanes (4), the rotor (2) has control slots (21) 
configured to prevent supplied oil flowing from an operating 

chamber (12) with higher pressure into an operating chamber 
with lower pressure. 
Rotor-type pump in accordance with claim 1, in which the 
opening stroke of the moving reeds (25, 25A) in the valve device 

(23) is limited by a supporting body (26), 
characterized in that the supporting body (26) has oil pockets 

(30) in the reed (25, 25A) area for attenuating the opening 
movement.
