<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the purification of nucleic acids 
and pertains particularly to an improved method and apparatus for the 
purification of nucleic acids, plasmids and the like. A great deal of laboratory research is carried out in which 
recombinant DNA techniques are utilized. Among the research activities 
carried out are DNA sequencing, DNA restriction mapping, DNA probe 
generation, construction of other plasmid or related DNA from smaller 
pieces, RNA transcription from a plasmid template, hybridization blot 
analysis, transformation into bacterial, yeast or mammalian cells, S1 
nuclease mapping, microinjection into embryos, and election microscopy 
analysis. All of these require substantially pure concentrations of plasmid 
DNA. Many techniques and apparatus exist for small scale purification of 
plasmid DNA. The typical prior art approach to the purification of 
plasmids involves a series of steps, including a collection of cells  
 
grown in liquid culture by centrifugation, separation 
of the bacterial chromatic (genomic) DNA, and cellular 
debris from the soluble contents of the bacteria by 
centrifugation of filtration, and concentration of the 
plasmid DNA apart from other cellular components by 
alcohol or isopropanol, absorption to solid media 
(i.e. ion exchange resin, glass powder, reverse phase 
chromatography resin, etc.), or salt precipitation. 
Additional purification steps may be added to these, 
such as phenol/chloroform extraction, secondary 
alcohol precipitation, protease or ribonuclease 
treatment to further purify the plasmid DNA. Other methods of plasmid purification include the 
additional steps of the addition of CsCl to 
supernatant from the bacterial lysis after removal of 
the bacterial genomic DNA, followed by 
ultracentrifugation. The ultracentrifugation results 
in a CsCl density gradient in which the plasmid DNA 
forms a sharp band. This band is removed from the 
gradient, and the DNA separated from the CsCl by 
alcohol precipitation or other suitable means. These 
procedures are widely used in molecular biology 
research for plasmid purification, and have been 
refined to produce plasmid DNA, which is suitable for 
use in virtually any subsequent procedure of molecular 
biology. Certain apparatus have been developed for 
purification of plasmid DNA. One such apparatus is 
available from a company called Applied Biosystems, 
and can purify DNA from samples of tissue, blood, 
bacteria, etc. The apparatus utilizes repeated 
organic extraction of sample
