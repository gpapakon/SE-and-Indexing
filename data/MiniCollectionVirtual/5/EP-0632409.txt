<ABSTRACT>
For the accounting of a journey based on a fixed-price agreement, it is proposed to extend a known taxi meter, to the effect that the agreed fixed price can be entered in the taxi meter before the start of the journey, and that this journey price is indicated invariably until the end of the journey. Entry is to be made in this case preferably by the selection and confirmation of prices which are filed in the taxi meter and are recorded in tabulated form according to journey destinations and which can be indicated by the call-up of journey-destination codes.

<CLAIMS>
Electronic taximeter having at least one control
element, a tariff memory and a display device for charging

for a journey based on a fixed-fare agreement,
characterized


a. in that the fixed fare agreed for the journey is
entered in the taximeter by the at least one control

element before commencement of the journey,
b. in that the fixed fare is displayed by means of the
display device until the completion of the journey and
c. in that all the control elements relevant for the
entry of the fixed fare are disabled during the

journey in respect of a change of the entered fixed
fare.
Electronic taximeter according to Claim 1,
characterized


a. in that a control element for the entry of the fixed
fare can be used, from the "FOR HIRE" taximeter

operating state, to switch on an operating mode which
suppresses the display of a fare calculated on a

distance-dependent and/or time-dependent basis,
b. in that a plurality of fare groups stored in the
tariff memory can be successively selected and

displayed in the switched-on operating mode and
c. in that a displayed fare from the preselected fare
group, upon confirmation of said fare, forms the fixed

fare for the following journey.
Electronic taximeter according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the control elements relevant for the

entry of the fixed fare remain disabled also for a
presettable time after completion of the journey.
Electronic taximeter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a basic fare is allocated to 

each selected fare group, said basic fare being displayed
and being changeable stepwise by the actuation of a control

element.
Electronic taximeter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fare is selected in the

respective fare groups by calling in an identifier stored
in lists in the tariff memory.
Electronic taximeter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the switching-on of

surcharges or deductions for special driving situations
(night-time journeys, journeys on Sundays and holidays)

and/or for special driving assignments (special
consignments, courier services, light-goods transportation,

carriage of sick persons) is possible in the switched-on
operating state for the entry of a fixed fare within a

selected fare group.
Electronic taximeter according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the identifier is constituted by the

postcode, the number of the municipal district or the place
name.
Electronic taximeter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a signal is given when a

maximum travel distance and/or maximum travel time on which
the displayed fare is based is exceeded.
Electronic taximeter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a journey charged for

according to a fixed fare is registered in a check memory.
Electronic taximeter according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the contents of the check memory are

made available to a data interface for controlling a
voucher printer and/or for storage on a mobile mass data 

storage device, in particular a hard-card storaqe device.
