<ABSTRACT>
An epoxy-modified polyamide resin is obtained by reacting (A) a diisocyanate with (B) at least one of a 5 dicarboxylic acid and a tricarboxylic acid anhydride in a nitrogen-containing aprotic solvent to form a polyamide resin intermediate and reacting this polyamide resin intermediate with (C) an epoxy resin in the nitrogen-containing aprotic solvent. This epoxy-modified polyamide resin has a high 10 molecular weight and can provide a film with excellent heat resistance arid flexibility, and its composition can be used as a coating material, adhesive or similar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing epoxy-modified polyamide resins, the epoxy-modified
polyamide resins obtained from the process, and
the epoxy-modified polyamide resin films.Polyamide resins have high polarity and strong
hydrogen bond with a high bond energy between the
nitrogen and carbon atoms in the amide linkage, so that
they are excellent in heat resistance and widely used
for applications where heat resistance is required.As means for the preparation of such polyamide
resins, a method is known in which a diisocyanate and a
dicarboxylic acid and/or a tricarboxylic anhydride are
subjected to carbon dioxide gas elimination
polymerization in a nitrogen-containing aprotic solvent.
The produced polymerization solution can be put to use
as a paint, adhesive or such in the form as it is.
According to this method, however, it is difficult to
obtain polyamide resins of high molecular weight, and
the obtained polyamide resins are not always
satisfactory in their film properties, especially
flexibility.In Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (JP-A)
Nos. 5-51447, 5-230169, 5-51571 and 5-230430, there
is disclosed a process for preparing an epoxy-modified 
polyamide resin by removing a nitrogen-containing
aprotic solvent from a polyamide resin solution prepared
by a known method, purifying the polyamide resin,
dissolving it in a nitrogen-free aprotic solvent again,
followed by reacting with an epoxy resin.Further, in JP-A No. 2-22319, there is
disclosed a process for preparing an epoxy-modified
polyamide resin without using a solvent.However, the obtained epoxy-modified polyamide
resins are not always satisfactory in their heat
resistance.Further, since the process described in the
JP-A Nos. 5-51447, 5-230169, 5-51571 and 5-230430
includes the step of removing a nitrogen-containing
aprotic solvent from a polyamide resin solution and the
step of dissolving it in a nitrogen-free aprotic solvent
again, this process is placed at a disadvantage in
respect of the cost for manufacturing the epoxy-modified
polyamide resin.JP-A-63210120 discloses preparation of heat-resistant, flexible films.JP-A-01024822 discloses heat-resistant polymer for stretched film.EP-A-0612781 discloses epoxy-terminated polyamides, adhesives made therefrom and methods for producing them.The present invention has for its object to
provide a process for preparing epoxy-modified polyamide
resins which have a high molecular weight and can
produce a film with excellent heat resistance and
flexibility and whose composition
