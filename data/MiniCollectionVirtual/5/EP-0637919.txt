<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVELTY INFLATABLE HATSThis invention relates to novelty decorated hats, adaptable, for example, to toys, games, advertising, and/or sport themes, which are inflatable.Inflatable hats have been designed in the past generally to provide an inflatable and expandable dome section attached to a crown section, whereby the hat may be inflated and expanded to a selected degree. Such hats also generally provide for normal use, as in U.S. Patent No. 2,593,188, when no enlargement is maintained. Electrical devices may also be attached to the crown section to provide a lighted dome section as desired. Similar designs for inflatable hats are illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. Des. 278,381 and Des. 316,325.Inexpensive novelty hats may be fabricated of pliable, yet substantially inelastic sheet materials that are inflatable to fill a predetermined form. Such hats may be provided in many shapes and sizes and may serve many purposes, ranging, for example, from play and amusement to thematic ventures to advertising promotions.It is an object of this invention to provide novelty, inflatable hats which may be adorned with various colored designs, added decorations, and the like. The present invention therefore provides a head cover, inflatable to define a novelty shape or design, including at least two shaped hat sections, each hat section being sealed to another along vertically-inclined side edges and a top edge thereof, and having an open bottom edge, a shaped crown section adjacent the bottom edge, described by a seal running across the shaped hat sections and continuous with the sealed side and top edges, and inflation means attached to said head cover, whereby the sealed portions describe a hat structure that may be inflated to provide a head-fitting novelty hat structure.Inflation of the head cover serves to expand the hat structure to that form defined by the shape of its original sheet fabrication materials. Preferably such 

sheet materials are thin, flexible, and impermeable to gases, whereby the hat structure may be filled with, gas to describe its extended form and to maintain this form for a substantial period of time with little or no leakage of the gas. In addition to the decorative designs which, may be painted or printed on the sheet sections, added decorative items may be incorporated by fixation to the sheet sections, or by the design of the sheet sections. Such items may include animal heads, reptiles, birds, doll's heads, and various sports or advertising creations.Another feature of this invention is
