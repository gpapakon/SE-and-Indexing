<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to expendable propellant storage 
tanks comprising the features of the pre-characterizing portion of claim 1, for rocket propelled missiles and like armament. Munitions carrying missiles achieve flight and are propelled 
at high velocities by the thrust of expanding gases created by a 
hypergolic reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer, the 
propellants, released from reservoirs or storage tanks, as 
variously termed, carried by the missile. Hence, the propellant 
storage tanks form a necessary component of a weapon carrying 
missile, more particularly, of the missile's propulsion system. 
Propellant storage tanks for the foregoing application are 
intended for a single use and, hence, are expendable in 
application. The tank for storing the fuel, such as Hydrazine, 
N2H4, is substantially the same tank structure to store the 
accompanying Oxidizer, N2O4, with which the fuel reacts both of 
which are known propellants. The effectiveness of the missile 
depends not only on the quantity of propellant carried, which is 
related in part to the missiles intended target range, but also 
upon the means by which the propellant is effectively extracted 
from the storeage reservoir and efficiently consumed. The 
storage tank's cost of manufacture, volume efficiency and weight 
are important considerations in tank design. Propellant storage tanks for the foregoing missile 
application must not only withstand high internal pressures with 
limited radial and axial expansion, but must be light in weight.  
 
Typically the propellant tank is formed of a relatively thin 
thickness of light weight metal, such as Aluminum. To provide 
greater strength an outer wrap of graphite composite material, 
which is also very light in weight, is applied to the outside 
surface of the tank. In forming the wrap, graphite strip 
material is wound around the outer surface of the tank on all 
sides. Typically that wrap is formed in two layers; the first is 
known as a helical wrap and the second wrap, overlying the 
helical wrap, is known as the hoop wrap. The use of such 
composite wrap dictates the tank's shape: a cylindrical central 
section having relatively rounded or dome shaped front and back 
ends, more specifically ends that are sections of an oblate 
spheroid. The tank cannot be of a simple "oil drum" shape with 
flat ends. In a typical propulsion system of the foregoing type, a gas, 
stored under high pressure in a separate reservoir, provides the 
necessary force to force the propellants, whether

tank (1) being of the rolling diaphragm type containing an 

outer tubular diaphragm (23) and in inner tubular diaphragm 
(21), with said inner tubular diaphragm (21) being positioned 

within said outer tubular diaphragm (23) and oriented coaxially 
therewith on a common axis to define a propellant cavity therebetween, 

and a piston (20) coupled to an end of said diaphragms, 
wherein said diaphragms are rolled over responsive to 

travel of said piston (20) along said common axis to contract 
the size of said propellant cavity and force propellant therefrom 

through an outlet (5) of said tank (1) characterized in

comprising: 


a composite wrapped pressure tank (1) defining an internal 
cavity (24), said tank including an inlet port (3) to said cavity (24), located 

at an end of said tank (1), and an outlet port (5) to said cavity located 
at an opposed end of said tank (1) and a cylindrical metal wall 

extending at least partially along the length of said tank (1);
