<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the bearing arrangement of the customer-side transparent pane (6) of a sales counter (1). In order to avoid the need to support the transparent pane (6) in its closed position at the bottom edge remote from its tilting bearing, the invention provides for a holding profile (11) which has at least two adjacent through-grooves (12, 13), in one groove (12), forming a hinge, of which a web profile (10) gripping around the bottom edge (9) of the pane engages and in the other groove (13) of which a stop web (14) of the web profile (10) engages. The groove (13) widens in the shape of a wedge downwards. Its wall surfaces (15, 16) form stops for the stop web (14) in the closed and open position of the transparent pane.

Display cabinet for displaying food products, having a 
substructure (2) which is covered by a product-carrying shelf (3) 

and having at least one transparent pane (6) which protects the 
displayed products on the customer side, extends obliquely 

upwards in the direction of the serving side and in the upper 
region merges curvedly into a horizontal portion (8), the lower 

edge (9) of which transparent pane is held in a web profile (10) 
which forms a hinge joint (7) and is guided rotatably and 

detachably on a continuous holding profile (11) also forming the 
hinge joint (7) and connected to the substructure (2), 

characterised in that the holding profile (11) has, besides a 
hinge-forming groove (12), an additional stop groove (13) in 

which a stop web (14) of the web profile (10) engages, the 
distance between the wall faces (15,16) which bound the stop 

groove (13) determining the pivoting angle of the transparent 
pane (6), with other supports which act on the pane (6) itself 

being avoided. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the hinge joint (7) formed by the web profile (10) and by the 

holding profile (11) is designed as a sliding guide. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that a web (20) bounding the groove (12) has a continuous wall 

thickening (21) which is approximately circular in cross-section 
and on which the web profile (10) is mounted in a hinge-forming 

manner by a fitting concave moulding-like groove (22). 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the stop web (14) has 

an approximately rectangular cross-section and the stop groove 
(13) has an approximately triangular cross-section with the 

vertex extending upwards.  
 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the bearing faces 

(16,17) of the stop web (14) and of the wall of the stop groove 
(13), which bearing faces face each other in the closed position 

of the transparent pane (6), have interengaging centring elements 
(18,19), for example a longitudinally continuous bead and groove. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 2 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the web profile (10) is 

slidably guided, in particular on the wall thickening (21) of the 
web (20) bounding the groove (12), by means of sliding rollers 

(23) mounted rotatably on said web profile or sliding bearings 
on the holding profile (11). 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the web profile (10) 

bears, in its closed position of the transparent pane (6), 
against the associated boundary wall of the groove (12) by means 

of a shock-absorbing element (24), for example a rubber-elastic 
profile. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that the sliding rollers (23) and/or the shock-absorbing profile 

(24) are arranged in inserts (26,27) and the inserts (26,27) are 
held in fitting continuous guides (28,29) of the web profile. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the web profile (10) and 

the holding profile (11) consist of extruded profiles, in 
particular of aluminium. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that a tilting fitting (37), 

which holds the lower edge (9) of the pane is mounted rotatably 
about a horizontal axis in a receiving groove (38) of the web 

profile (10), and in that the tilting fitting (37) bears tiltably 
by its one side against a continuous bead (39) of the receiving  

 
groove (38) and is supported on its other side by two adjusting 

screws (40) or the like, which are guided in the web profile (10) 
on both sides of the bead (39). 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that, if a plurality of 

transparent panes (6) are arranged side by side, they are 
arranged in the same plane and are laterally displaceable in a 

common guide (12,22). 
Display cabinet according to Claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that a holding device (30) 

for mounting and fixing a removed transparent pane (6) is 
provided on the customer-side ledge (5) or at a distance 

therefrom. 
Display cabinet according to Claim 12, characterised in that 
the holding device comprises a strip (32) which extends parallel 

to the face of the pane and the cross-section of which is of a 
design which is appropriate for receiving the concave moulding-like 

groove (22) of the web profile (10) of the transparent pane 
(6), a supporting element (34) being provided at a distance (33) 

from the strip (32) as a lateral stop for preventing a pivoting 
movement of the mounted transparent pane (6). 
Display cabinet according to Claim 13, characterised in that 
the strip (32) is secured, between two tubes (34,35), bars or the 

like, forming the ledge, on the brackets (31) carrying them, one 
tube (34,35) or the like acting as a lateral stop.
