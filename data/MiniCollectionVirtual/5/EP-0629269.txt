<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to commonly-owned, 
co-pending patent application entitled SYSTEM 
AND METHOD FOR TRANSMISSION GEARBOX NOISE CONTROL 
UTILIZING LOCALIZED OIL COOLING/HEATING (S-4463). The invention relates to a transmission according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a trasnsmission is known from EP-A-0 236 908. The present invention is directed to systems and 
methods for reducing noise levels resulting from 
transmission vibrations, and more particularly, to 
configurational modifications in the reduction 
gearing of a transmission system for abating 
undesirable noise levels due to differential thermal 
expansion of the gearbox housing. The system and 
method of the present invention has particular 
utility in abating main transmission gearbox noise 
generation in helicopters such as the S-76速 (S-76 is 
a registered trademark of the Sikorsky Aircraft 
Division of United-Technologies Corporation) that 
incorporate centralized bull gear/bull pinion 
reduction gearing. Noise control is a primary concern for the 
transmission design engineer, and particularly so in 
the design of the helicopter main transmisssion. 
Excessive vibrations generated by transmissions  
 
typically result in undesirable noise levels in 
helicopter cockpits and/or cabins, which causes 
operator/passenger aural discomfort. Cabin and/or 
cockpit noise abatement is a particular concern in 
helicopters wherein the final stage of reduction 
gearing of the main transmission comprises one or 
more bull pinions interacting with a central bull 
gear. For example, Sikorsky helicopters of the S.76速 
series, e.g., S-76A, S-76B, S-76C, have a main 
transmission that includes three stages of reduction 
gearing: a first stage for each engine output 
consisting of helical gearing, an intermediate stage 
consisting of spiral bevel gearing, and a final 
reduction stage comprising a central bull gear that 
intermeshes with right and left hand bull pinions (to 
combine the inputs of the two engines that provide 
the motive power for S-76速 helicopters). Research 
has shown that the cockpit and/or cabin noise levels 
of S-76速 helicopters are primarily the result of 
vibrations originating in the main transmission. Narrow band Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 
analyses, A-weighted octave levels, and overall DBA 
levels recorded in the cockpits and/or cabins of S-76A, 
S-76B, and S-76C helicopters indicate that 
interior noise levels are predominately the result of 
vibrations occurring at the bull gearing meshing 
frequency of 778 Hz,

<CLAIMS>
A transmission (100) having baseline spur 
gearing having a predetermined design contact ratio 

for a predetermined stabilized operating condition of 
the transmission (100), predetermined base circle 

diameters, predetermined pitch diameters, 
predetermined outside diameters, and a predetermined 

helix correction angle, 
characterized in that a baseline spur gearing being 

formed from metallic materials having disparate 
coefficients of thermal expansion, respectively, such 

that the transmission housing (102) and the baseline spur 
gearing are subject to differential thermal expansion 

effects during operation thereof to generate 
vibrations that cause noise comprises: 


first means for modifying the baseline spur 
gearing to provide a modified spur gearing having 

an operating contact ratio greater than the 
predetermined design contact ratio of the baseline 

spur gearing at start up of the transmission (100), while 
concomitantly maintaining the predetermined base 

circle diameters and the predetermined pitch 
diameters constant, to counteract the effects of 

differential thermal expansion, said operation 
contact ratio of said modified spur gearing 

decreasing during operation of the transmission (100) in 
response to the effects of differential thermal 

expansion such that said operating contact ratio of 
said modified spur gearing is substantially equal to 

the predetermined design contact ratio at the 
predetermined stabilized operating condition of the  

 
transmission (100); and 
second means for modifying the baseline spur 
gearing to provide said modified spur gearing having 

a modified helix correction angle greater than the 
predetermined helix correction angle of the baseline 

spur gearing to counteract the effects of 
differential thermal expansion; 
wherein said modified spur gearing provided by 
said first and second means counteracts the effects 

of differential thermal expansion thereby reducing noise 
levels resulting from transmission vibrations. 
The transmission (100) of Claim 1 wherein 
said modified spur gearing has increased chordal 

addenda such that the outside diameters of said 
modified spur gearing are greater than the 

predetermined outside diameters. 
The transmission (100) of claim 2 wherein 
said modified spur gearing comprises a central bull 

gear (110) having increased chordal addenda and first and 
second bull pinions (118) having increased chordal addenda 

such that the change in said outside diameter of said 
central bull gear (110) is equivalent to the change in said 

outside diameters of said first and second bull 
pinions (118).
