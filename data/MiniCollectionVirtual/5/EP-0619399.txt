<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and an equipment 
for opening a nip (N) in an extended-nip press. 

When the nip (N) between the rolls (10, 11) is 
opened, the loading shoe (12b) of the loading members 

of the extended-nip roll (11) is shifted to an 
open position and apart from the glide-belt mantle 

(F). In the method, the inside end-flange part (20b) 
of the end flange (20), which is operationally 

coupled with the bearing means (21) of the glide-belt 
mantle (F), is rotated as parallel to the face (C) 

of the central axle (13) of the roll (11), whereby the 
glide-belt mantle (F) is separated from contact with 

the back-up roll (10) as the central axis (X₂) of the 
end-flange part (20b) is placed at a distance (E) 

from the central axis (X₁) of the roll (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an extended-nip press and a method for opening the nip in an extended-nip press 
according to the preambles of claims 1 and 5, which are based on GB-A-2 182 367. When the back-up roll in an extended-nip press is heated, the press felt and the 
glide-belt mantle may be damaged if the press has to be stopped out of some reason 
because of a disturbance in running. For example, when the temperature of the water 
in a hot-water heated back-up roll is 140°C and the surface temperature is about 
80°C during running, after stopping the surface temperature rises to about 120°C. Since the compression of the back-up roll against the closed glide-belt mantle is, as 
a rule, 20...35 mm, the contact with the back-up roll cannot be removed even if the 
glide shoe is pulled into the open position. Nor is it possible to displace the back-up 
roll and the extended-nip roll rapidly into an open position in relation to one another, 
because, owing to the very high maximal load, the press force is transferred through 
draw bars or through the frame skeleton. In the present application, an opening method is described in which an eccentric end 
of the extended-nip press roll is rotated after a movement of opening of the press 
shoe so that the belt mantle is shifted apart from the back-up roll. In view of avoiding thermal damage to the press felt, the guide rolls of the felt loop 
may also be displaceable so that the contact of the felt with a hot roll is separated. The method and equipment of opening that are employed herein facilitate replacements 
of felt and glide-belt mantle and make the replacements quicker.  
 The method in accordance with the invention has the characterizing features of claim 1. The extended-nip press in accordance with the invention has the characterizing features of claim 5. In the extended-nip press according to GB-A-2 182 367 the 
end pieces to which the glide-belt mantle is attached 
are radially displacable for e g felt replacement which 
is a technically more complicated arrangement. The extended-nip press in accordance with the invention comprises an extended nip 
for a paper or board web. In connection with the lower roll, i.e. the extended-nip 
press roll, the arrangement of equipment comprises a press member, which can be 
pressed with a force against the back-up roll, which back-up roll is preferably 
heated. The back-up roll may also be a non-heated roll. The displaceable press 
member is preferably a press shoe, which can be pressed with the force of the 
loading-c
