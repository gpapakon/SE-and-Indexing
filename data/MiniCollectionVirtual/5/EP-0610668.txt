A device for axially securing rotor blades and for eliminating 
rotor imbalance in axial-flow compressors or turbines of gasturbine 

engines, in which the feet (2) of the rotor blades (1) 
are anchored in axial grooves (3) distributed over the 

periphery of a wheel disc (4), wherein each axial groove (3) 
comprises a cavity (T) formed between the groove base 

and the foot end, characterised in that a filler piece (5), 
resting on the groove base, and a securing plate (6) are 

inserted into each cavity (T), the securing plate (6) bridging 
a gap (S) extending along the cavity (T) and provided 

between the foot end and the filler piece (5) and, at both 
ends projecting from the cavity (T), being bent in opposite 

directions so as to rest against end surfaces of the filler piece 
(5), the wheel disc (4) and the blade foot (2), rotor 

imbalance being compensated by at least one filler piece. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
securing plate (6) has at each end two tabs (8, 9) separated 

from each other by a longitudinal slot (7), one tab being 
bent so as to rest against end surfaces of the blade foot (2) 

and a disc boss (10) and the other tab being bent so as to 
rest against end surfaces of the wheel rim (11) and the filler 

piece (5). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
securing plate (12) comprises two metal strips (13, 14), one 

end part (E1) thereof being bent so as to rest against a 
blade foot (2) and end surfaces of two disc bosses (10), and 

the other end part (E2) being bent so as to rest against the 
filler piece (5) and an end surface on the wheel rim (11).  

 
A device according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the bent tabs (8, 9) or end parts (E1, E2) 

of the securing plate (6; 12) form an edge seal for the axial 
groove (3) and the cavity (T) containing the filler piece (5). 
A device according to one or more of the claims, 
characterised in that the filler pieces (5), each having a 

uniform contour, form balancing masses locally specifically 
adapted by material recesses (M) of different sizes. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
filler pieces (5) are all manufactured from a material of 

lower specific weight than the material of the wheel disc (4). 
A device according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the filler pieces (5) are provided with 

imbalance-specific material fillings. 
A device according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the filler pieces (5) are adapted to the 

length and the shape of the cavity (T) between the securing 
plate (6; 12) and the groove base. 
A device according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
filler pieces (5) are held at the side and the bottom of the 

cavity (T) by a cross-section softly rounded or substantially 
semi-circular at the corner over at least part of their 

longitudinal extent. 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
securing plate (12) comprises two metal strips (13, 14) of 

different widths. 
A device according to claim 3 or 10, characterised in that 
the securing plate is composed of two metal strips of 

different lengths with respect to the end parts or tabs to be 
bent.  

 
A device according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the securing plate (6; 12) is applied 

with tabs (7, 8) or end parts (E1, E2) already bent in opposite 
directions at one end. 
A device according to claim 1 or 3, characterised in that the 
securing plate (12) comprises two metal strips (13, 14) 

soldered or welded together, leaving unconnected end 
parts (E1, E2).
