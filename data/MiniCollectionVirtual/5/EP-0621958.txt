<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a seismic source system (10) for marine surveying using a small diameter hose bundle (22) containing an electrical cable (40) disposed within an air hose (46) which is reinforced with torque-balanced layers of armor components (50) and protective jacket (60) and connected to a termination assembly (20) at one end for connection to an electrical power supply (18), pressurized air supply (16) and control system (14) and connected to another termination assembly (26) at the other end for connection to an air gun subarray comprising multiple air guns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to marine seismic
exploration and, more specifically, to an armored hose
bundle for connecting to an air gun subarray, and to a
seismic source system utilizing such a hose bundle.In the field of marine seismic exploration
(surveying), an acoustic signal is generated in a body
of water by a source such as an air gun. Typically,
several air guns are arranged in spaced relationship to
each other. Such arrangement generally is referred to
as a subarray. One or more air gun subarrays are towed
behind a vessel to perform seismic surveying. In
typical operation, one end of a hose bundle (also
referred to as an umbilical) is connected to an air gun
subarray (one hose bundle per air gun subarray) and the
other end of the hose bundle is connected to equipment
on the vessel. The hose bundle supplies compressed air
and electrical power to the air guns and also provides
electrical communication between the air guns and the
equipment on the vessel.A typical prior art hose bundle, as exemplified by
US-A-4525813, contains an air hose in the middle of the
hose bundle for carrying pressurized air to the air
guns. A number of insulated electrical conductors are
placed around the air hose for carrying electrical
power to the air guns and for providing communication
between the air guns and the equipment on the vessel.
An outer-shell having armor components and an outer
protective jacket is placed around the electrical
conductors. Each hose bundle is several hundred feet
in length and is normally stored on the vessel by
winding the hose bundle on a storage reel which imparts
a certain amount of stress on the electrical 
conductors.In the above-described prior art hose bundle, the
electrical conductors become an integral, non-removable
part of the hose bundle during the manufacturing
process. Therefore, damaged electrical conductors
cannot be removed and/or replaced with new electrical
conductors once the hose bundle has been manufactured.
To minimize this problem, it is common to include spare
electrical conductors in the hose bundle. The spare
electrical conductors allow for the continued use of
the hose bundle even after some of the electrical
conductors become damaged and non-operative. The spare
electrical conductors, however, are exposed to the same
wear conditions as the remaining electrical conductors.Another problem with the prior art hose bundle is
its diameter which affects the overall weight and
manufacturing cost of the hose bundle and the
operational costs of storing and towing the

A marine seismic exploration hose bundle
comprising an air hose (46) forming an air space (48)

for carrying pressurized air to actuate an air gun
subarray (34) and armored with armor material (50)

arranged around the air hose (46) to form an armored
air hose (47), there being electrical cable (40) for

carrying electrical power and signals between a control
system (14) and the subarray, characterised in that the

electrical cable (40) is disposed inside the armored
air hose (47) in the air space (48).
A hose bundle according to claim 1, the
armored air hose (47) comprising:


(a) a first layer (52) of flexible armor material
helically wound around the air hose (46); and
(b) first holding means (54) placed around the
first layer of flexible armor material for holding the

first layer of flexible armor material in position.
A hose bundle according to claim 2, the
armored air hose (47) comprising:


(c) a second layer (56) of flexible armor
material helically wound around the first holding means

in a direction which is opposite to the winding
direction of the first layer of flexible armor

material;
(d) second holding means (58) placed around the
second layer of flexible armor material for holding the

second layer of flexible armor material in position;
and
(e) a protective coating (60) disposed over the
second holding means.

preceding claims, wherein the electrical cable (40)

comprises a plurality of electrical conductors (42)
sheathed by an insulation layer (44).
A hose bundle according to claim 4, wherein 
the insulation layer (44) is made of a material able to

withstand the pressure changes and resist the erosion
forces from the flow of the pressurized air for

actuating the air gun subarray.
A hose bundle according to claim 5, wherein
the material of the insulation layer (44) is

polyethylene.
A hose bundle according to claim 4, wherein
the material of the insulation layer (44) is

polyurethane.
A hose bundle according to any one of the
preceding claims and comprising a supply termination

assembly (20) at one end of the hose bundle and a
distribution termination assembly (26) at the other end

of the hose bundle, respectively for receiving and
distributing pressurized air and for electrical power

and signals.
A hose bundle according to 8, wherein between
the termination assemblies (20 and 26) the electrical

cable (40) is loosely disposed within the air space
(48) of the armored air hose (47) and wherein the

armored air hose (47) is held at the termination
assemblies by respective air hose retention means (74,

100) so that stresses acting along the hose bundle in
use are taken up principally by the armored air hose

(47), thereby placing minimal stress on the electrical
cable (40).

bundle according to claim 8 or 9 and an air gun

subarray having a plurality of air guns (34) connected
to the distribution termination assembly (26) for
