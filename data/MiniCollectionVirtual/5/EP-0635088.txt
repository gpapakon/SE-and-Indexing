<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to buildings and in particular to a building panel for
use in constructing buildings.There is throughout the world a need for dwellings and other buildings that can be
rapidly and cheaply constructed and there have been many proposals for constructing such
buildings. However, generally, the quality of such buildings has been low and/or such
buildings have not been as simple to construct as would be desirable.It is well known to construct buildings by erecting a rigid structural framework,
for example of steel girders, and to bolt prefabricated panels between the girders to
provide the desired outer and inner walls. However, such buildings are expensive and
time-consuming to erect. Alternatively, it is known to erect buildings and enclosures out
of prefabricated load-bearing panels that are connected together to provide the desired
outer walls of the buildings. However, buildings made in this way are not acceptable as
dwelling because they do not meet the requirements of file-resistance. The problem of
making fire-resistant prefabricated panels is complicated if they bear substantial loads
since the load tends to accelerate the disintegration of a panel when subject to fire.It is also known to make building panels out of concrete containing a layer of
insulating material. However such panels are heavy and difficult to transport and do not
have good insulating properties. Also the insulation does not adhere to the concrete and
so the panel is not a composite structure.WO-A-89/11573 describes a panel having a pair of face sheets and a sandwiched
insulating material that is not rigid; this panel is unsuitable for use as a load-bearing wall.US-A-4 712 352 describes a load-bearing composite panel having a pair of face
sheets and a sandwiched insulating foam.US-A-2 131 268 describes a building having a rigid structural framework, for
example of steel studs, and prefabricated panels fixed between the studs to provide the
walls of the building.According to the present invention, there is provided a load-bearing building panel
as claimed in the accompanying claims As used herein, the term "load-bearing panel"
means a panel capable of withstanding compressive forces between the top and the bottom 
surfaces of at least 5 kN/m and preferably at least 10 kN/m; generally we aim at
providing a panel capable of withstanding a compressive force of about 20 to 30 kN/m.It is emphasized that the panel of the present invention is composite in nature, that
is to say the face sheets adhere to, and

<CLAIMS>
A rectilinear building panel having a pair of opposed faces, and a pair of opposed

sides (66,70), the panel comprising a pair of spaced-apart rigid face sheets (56)
and an insulating material (58) sandwiched between the sheets and wherein the

opposed sides (66,70) each have a profiled shape for mating with a
correspondingly profiled side of an adjacent panel and wherein the sides (66,70)

have means (72,74) for securing them to sides of adjacent panels, characterised in
that the insulating material (58) is rigid and adheres to the face sheets (56), that

the panel is load-bearing and forms a composite structure and that the panel
includes connecting means (60) connecting the face sheets together to resist

relative movement between the face sheets in the plane of the panel and out of the
plane of the panel.

are spaced inwardly of the opposed sides (66,70).
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the connecting means (60)
is a stud extending through the panel and is secured to the face sheets (56).
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the connecting means (60)

is not secured to the connecting means.
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the connecting means
(10) is embedded in the rigid insulating means.
A building comprising a foundation (10), a plurality of walls enclosing a space
within the building, the walls being formed partly or wholly from panels as

claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, whose opposed sides (66,70) are secured
together, the building including means (14) secured to the foundation for holding

the bases of the panels, means (22) for holding the tops of the panels and a roof
structure supported on the walls, wherein the walls made of the said panels form

the or part of the structural frame of the building.
A building as claimed in claim 12, which is single storey.
A building as claimed in claim 12, which is multi-storey and wherein each storey
comprises a row of panels as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11.
A building as claimed in any one of claims 12 to 14, wherein the internal walls of
the panels are clad with a fire-resistant material (52).
A kit for forming a building, the kit comprising a plurality of panels as defined in
any one of claims 1 to 11 that can be secured together to form walls, means (14)

for securing to the foundation of a building for holding the base of the panels,
