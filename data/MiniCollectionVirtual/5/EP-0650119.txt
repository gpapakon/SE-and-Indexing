<ABSTRACT>
A window manager for a multi-windowing system including a windowing server (20) for controlling the display of first windows reserved by customer programs inside a second window reserved by the system. The server holds in memory a tree structure of windowing data having a root (100) defining the second window and nodes (110, 120) defining corresponding first windows. The manager is configured to manage a list (50) of identifiers of first windows in the root, to detect, in each node, the presence or absence of a check datum (70) and in the presence of such a check datum in respect of a node corresponding to a particular first window, to manage the layout and circulation of the first windows on the basis of second windowing data (60) placed under the control of one of the customer programs.
