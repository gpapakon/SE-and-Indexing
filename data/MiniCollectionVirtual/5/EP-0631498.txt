<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a convex ring for use in 
connection with an ostomy appliance, consisting of at 
least two parts adapted to be coupled together, a first 
coupling part being intended for attachment around the 
patient's stoma. Below an ostomy patient or an ostomist denotes a person 
having a colostomy, an ileostomy or a urostomy. In such 
persons the colon, the ileum or the ureter has been exposed 
surgically such that the waste products of the body, 
which are conveyed through these organs, are discharged 
through an artificial opening and are collected in a collection 
bag, which is ordinarily adhered to the skin by 
means of an adhesive plate with an opening surrounding the 
stoma. It is frequently seen in ostomy patients that the stoma or 
its closest surroundings are recessed or are positioned in 
a crater or a cavity with respect to the rest of the skin 
surface that surrounds the stoma. For such patients it is 
expedient to use an ostomy appliance where the adhesive 
surface around the opening of the appliance for receiving 
the stoma has a part which protrudes toward the user with 
a view to enabling the adhesive face of the ostomy appliance 
to engage and adhere to the skin everywhere in the 
crater or the cavity. In particular, it is important that 
the ostomy appliance adheres to the skin as closely to the 
stoma as possible, and this location is most frequently 
the one lying deepest. The shape of the forwardly protruding 
part of the adhesive face may e.g. be domed or conical.  
 Throughout the specification the term convex has this 
broad meaning irrespective of the actual embodiment. Ostomy equipment having a convex part protruding toward 
the user is known from e.g. EP patent applications 415282, 
415592, 317326 and 416397. The two first-mentioned patent applications concern ostomy 
equipment having an integrated protruding convex part. The 
ostomy equipment consists of a bag part and an attachment 
part, said parts being either interconnectible or being 
integrated. The attachment part, which is intended for 
attachment by adhesion around the patient's stoma, has a 
central opening and is coated with a layer of an adhesive 
material on the proximal side (the side facing the user), 
which has a radially inner and outer section, the radially 
inner section being relatively rigid and having a convex 
shape. Ostomy equipment of the above-mentioned type can only be 
used by ostomists having a recessed stoma. For ostomists 
without a recessed stoma it is thus necessary to

A convex ring in combination with an ostomy appliance 
consisting of at least two parts, 

a first coupling part (10, 110, 210, 310) having 
a proximal side being intended for adhesive attachment to 

the skin around the patient's stoma and comprising a ring-shaped 
part protruding in a distal direction, said ring
