<ABSTRACT>
Increased reliability for intelligent call processing systems 
is provided by collecting 

information from communications between the network database (108), 
the subscriber database (110), and 

the network switch (106). Message transfers between these network 
elements are monitored and 

correlated to identify those messages corresponding to a particular 
call. The messages for the 

call are analyzed to determine which database generated the 
instructions for routing the call. 

In particular, by comparing the routing number returned to the 
interexchange switch with the 

routing instruction information supplied by the subscriber's 
database (110), it can be determined 

whether the call was routed according to instructions from the 
subscriber's database (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems for routing telephone calls in which a dialed telephone 
number is translated into a routing number and, more particularly, to systems in which the 
translation of the dialed number is performed according to instructions from a database 
maintained by a telephone subscriber. Telephone systems which translate a dialed telephone number into a routing number 
for routing a telephone call are well known in the art. For example, toll-free or "800" number 
calls involve translating a dialed 800 number into a number for routing calls to an 800 number 
subscriber. The translation is performed by querying a database maintained by the telephone 
service provider, such as an 800 number database of an interexchange carrier, to determine 
a routing number for routing the call. Recent advances in processing telephone calls in which the dialed number is translated 
into a routing number for call routing have enabled the translation process to be controlled in 
part by the subscriber. In such systems, referred to herein as "Intelligent Call Processing" 
(ICP) systems, the subscriber maintains its own database to store routing instructions for 
selected special service calls. The subscriber's database is queried by a processor (also 
referred to herein as a "Network Control Point" or "NCP") in the communication system, at  
 
an appropriate point in call processing, to return routing instructions. The subscriber's 
database returns routing instruction information to the NCP, which in turn, provides call 
routing instructions to telephone switches within the communication system. Intelligent Call Processing systems provide a subscriber with improved call handling 
ability and increased flexibility. However, sometimes calls cannot be processed and routed 
according to instructions from the subscriber's database, and the subscriber does not have 
sufficient information to determine when, how often, or why this occurs. For example, if the 
subscriber's database does not respond to a query for instructions within a prescribed time 
period, the call is routed according to default routing instructions that are stored within the 
NCP. Similarly, default routing instructions are used when instructions returned by the 
subscriber's database in response to a query are not in a format recognizable to the NCP. 
Under these circumstances, the subscriber has no way to verify whether calls are being routed 
as the subscriber intends, and thus cannot determine how well the system is working. Increased

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a telecommunications system which routes 
special service calls according to routing instructions obtained from a subscriber 

database, the method comprising the steps of: 
   determining the routing instructions output by the subscriber database 

for a special service call; 
   comparing the routing instructions output by the subscriber database 

with the routing instructions actually used to route the special service call; and 
   responding to the result of the comparing step to provide an indication 

of whether the special service call was routed according to the routing instructions 
output by the subscriber database. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the comparing step comprises 
comparing a routing label output by the subscriber database for routing the special 

service call with the routing number used to route the special service call. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the responding step comprises 
generating an indication that the special service call was routed using a default 

routing instruction. 
A method for use in an intelligent call processing system, the method 
comprising the steps of: 

   monitoring message transfers between a network special service call 
database, a subscriber database, and a network switch; 

   correlating messages corresponding to a predetermined special service 
call; and 

   analyzing selected information derived from the messages of the 
predetermined special service call to determine whether the special service call was 

routed according to routing instructions specified by the subscriber database. 
A method for use in an intelligent call processing system, the method 
comprising the steps of: 

   monitoring messages received by a network special service call database 
from a network switch and from a subscriber database;

 
   correlating messages corresponding to a predetermined special service 

call; and 
   analyzing selected information derived from the messages of the 

predetermined special service call to determine whether the special service call was 
routed according to routing instructions specified by the subscriber database. 
The invention of claim 4 or 5 wherein the correlating step comprises 
identifying messages corresponding to the special service call on the basis of an 

identifier unique to the special service call. 
The invention of claim 4 or 5 wherein the selected information 
includes a routing label specified by the subscriber database and a routing number 

specified by the network special service call database. 
The method of claim 4 or 5 wherein the selected information 
comprises billing record information which indicates how the special service call 

was routed. 
The invention of claim 1 or 5 further comprising the step of 
determining the elapsed time between initiation of a query for routing instructions of 

the subscriber database by a network processor and receipt by the network processor 
of a response to the query. 
The invention of claim 4 or 5 further comprising the step of 
generating an indication of whether the special service 
call was routed according to 
routing instructions specified by the subscriber database. 
The invention of claim 10 wherein the generating step comprises 
generating an indication that the special service call was routed using a default 

routing instruction. 
The invention of claim 1 or 10 further comprising the step of 
providing an indication of why the special service call was not routed according to 

the routing instructions output by the subscriber database. 
The invention of claim 4 or 5 further comprising the step of 
 

correlating the results of the analyzing step with non-routing information. 
The invention of claim 13 wherein the correlating step comprises 
determining on a caller-by-caller basis whether the special service call was routed 

according to routing instructions specified by the subscriber database.
