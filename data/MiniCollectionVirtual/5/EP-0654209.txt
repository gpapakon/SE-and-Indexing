<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a hay making machine having a structure (1) composed of a central part (2) and of lateral parts (3 to 6) articulated together, which parts (2 to 6) include casings (16) with which are associated rotors (15) which are mounted so that they can rotate on support spindles (20) about which they are driven in rotation by means of shafts (23) housed in the structure (1), each of the said support spindles (20) being equipped at its lower end with a bearing wheel (24) and being fastened at its upper end into a sleeve (bushing) (28) which is mounted so that it can pivot in a bearing (30) of the corresponding casing (16) of the structure (1) and which has a lever (35) for adjusting its position in the said bearing (30).   It is noteworthy in that at least on the central part (2) of the structure (1), the bearing (30) of the sleeve (28) of the support spindle (20) for each of the rotors (15) is completely situated on the inner side of the upper wall (31) of the corresponding casing (16), that the said bearing (30) extends right along the drive shaft (23) of the rotors (15), and that the adjusting lever (35) is situated between the drive shaft (23) and the upper wall (31) and that it extends through a first opening or slot (38) in the bearing (30) and a second opening or slot (39) provided in a lateral wall (40) of the casing (16).

Haymaking machine which has a frame (1) made up of a central part (2)
equipped with a device (8) for hitching to a tractor and of lateral parts (3 to

6) articulated to the central part (2), which parts (2 to 6) comprise casings
(16) with which are associated rotors (15) which are mounted to rotate on

approximately vertical support spindles (20), about which they are driven in
rotation during work by means of drive shafts (23) housed in the frame (1),

each of the said support spindles (20) being equipped at its lower end with a
carrying wheel (24) and being fixed at its upper end into a bush (28) which is

mounted to pivot in a guide bearing (30) provided in the corresponding
casing (16) of the frame (1) and which has a lever (35) for adjusting its

position in the said bearing (30), 
characterized in
 that at least in the central
part (2) of the frame (1) the guide bearing (30) of the bush (28) of the

support spindle (20) of each of the rotors (15) is fully located on the inside of
the upper wall (31) of the corresponding casing (16), that the said guide

bearing (30) extends on either side of the drive shaft (23) that drives the
rotors (15) in rotation, and that the lever (35) for adjusting the said bush (28)

and the corresponding support spindle (20) is situated between the
rotational-drive shaft (23) and the upper wall (31) of the casing (16) and that

it extends through a first opening or slot (38) provided in the guide bearing
(30) and a second opening or slot (39) provided in a lateral wall (40) of the

casing (16).
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the bush (28) of the
support spindle (20) is retained in the corresponding bearing (30), in its

lengthwise direction, by the upper wall (31) of the casing (16), on the one
hand, and by a circlip (32), on the other hand. 
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the adjusting lever (35)
carries a small plate (41) for closing the slot (39) in the lateral wall (40).
Machine according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
 that the closing-off plate
(41) is pushed against the lateral wall (40) by means of a pressure spring

(42).
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the adjusting levers (35)
are connected to operating rods (43) by means of pivoting end fittings (44).
Machine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
 that the end fittings (44) are
mounted to pivot on the ends of the adjusting levers (35).
Machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
 that the ends of the
adjusting levers (35) are approximately perpendicular to the support spindles

(20) of the rotors (15).
Machine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
 that the end fittings (44) are
articulated to the rods (43) by means of axles (50) which are approximately

parallel to the support spindles (20) of the rotors (15).
