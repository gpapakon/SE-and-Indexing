<DESCRIPTION>
 BENZDCTOAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS MICROBICTDESThe present invention relates to novel benzimidazolesulfonic acid derivatives of the formula I below. It furthermore relates to the preparation of these substances and to agrochemicals comprising at least one of these compounds as active ingredient. The invention also relates to the preparation of the abovementioned compositions and to the use of the active ingredients or of the compositions for controlling or preventing infestation of plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, preferably fungi.The compounds according to the invention are those of the general formula Iin which the R2SO2 group is in the 1- or 3-position and causes the formation of pure or mixed positional isomers relative to the CF3 substituents and in which the substituents are as defined below:R1 is CN or -CS(=O)nNH2,R is CrC4al yl, C3-C6cycloalkyl or -N(R')2, in which R' substituents are different or identical C C3alkyl radicals, and n is 0 or 1.The term al yl itself or as a component of another substituent is to be understood as meaning the following straight-chain or branched groups, depending on the number of the carbon atoms indicated: methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and their isomers isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl.At room temperature, the compounds of the formula I are stable solids which are distinguished by valuable microbicidal properties. Their particularly advantageous activity 

is based mainly on the specific substitution pattern in the fused benzene ring. They can be used in a preventive and curative fashion in the field of agriculture or related fields for controlling phytopathogenic microorganisms. Used at low concentrations, the active ingredients of the formula I according to the invention are distinguished not only by an outstanding microbicidal, in particular fungicidal, activity, but also by the fact that they are particularly well tolerated by plants.Important compounds within the scope of the formula I are those in which R2 is C1-C2al yl, cyclopropyl or N(R')2, R' is methyl or ethyl and n is 0 or 1.One of the particularly important substance groups within this scope is the group in which R2 is methyl or N(R')2, R1 is methyl and n is 0 or 1. Particularly preferred compounds from amongst this group are those in which R2 is dimethylamino and n is 0 or 1.A group of preferred compounds of the formula I embraces the compounds in which the R2SO2 group is in the 1- or 3-position and causes the formation of pure or mixed positional isomers relative to the CF3
