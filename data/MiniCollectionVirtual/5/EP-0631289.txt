<ABSTRACT>
A bidirectional signal transfer shift register 
with a simple circuit construction is disclosed together 

with suitable applications of the same. The 
bidirectional signal transfer shift register comprises a 

plurality of flipflops each having an input terminal and 
an output terminal in pair. The input and output 

terminals of the flipflops are connected successively in 
such a manner as to construct a multi-stage structure. 

A forward route gate element is interposed in a 
connection route between the output terminal of the 

front stage side one of each two adjacent front and rear 
ones of the flipflops and the input terminal of the rear 

stage side flipflop, and a reverse route gate element is 
interposed in another connection route between the 

output terminal of the rear stage side flipflop and the 
input terminal of the front stage side flipflop. 

Forward direction signal transmission processing and 
reverse direction signal transmission processing can be 

switchably selected by alternatively controlling the 
forward and reverse route gate elements to open or 

close.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a
bidirectional signal transmission network and more
particularly to a bidirectional signal transfer shift
register which is suitably incorporated in
a drive circuit of an active matrix liquid crystal
display device and used for reversal display of an
image.An active matrix liquid crystal display device
is conventionally known and has such a a general
construction as shown in FIG. 6. Referring to FIG. 6,
the active matrix liquid crystal display device (LCD)
100 shown includes a liquid crystal layer 101 which
exhibits a predetermined electro-optical effect and is
held between a pair of transparent glass substrates 102
and 103. A plurality of picture element electrodes 104
are formed on an inner surface of the substrate 102 and
disposed in a matrix. A thin film transistor 105 made
of polycrystalline silicon or a like material is 
connected to each of the individual picture element
electrodes 104. The drain electrodes of the thin film
transistors 105 are connected to the corresponding
picture element electrodes 104; the source electrodes
are connected to corresponding data lines 106; and the
gate electrodes are connected to corresponding gate
lines 107. A plurality of opposing electrodes 108 are
formed on an entire inner surface of the other substrate
103. An image data signal is written by way of the
individual thin film transistors 105 into the
corresponding picture element electrodes 104. Electro-optical
variations of the liquid crystal layer 101
caused by the image data signal are detected as
transmission light mount variations by means of, for
example, a pair of polarization plates (not shown) to
effect display of a desired image.An active matrix liquid crystal display device
having the construction described above can be utilized,
for example, as a light valve for a liquid crystal
projector. A liquid crystal projector includes three
liquid crystal display devices to which the three
primary colors are allocated, and a common enlarging
projection lens system. The liquid crystal display
devices function as light valves for the different color 
systems of red, green and blue. The liquid crystal
display devices resolve a primary image into red, green
and blue components and display them. Red, green and
blue illumination light beams are introduced
simultaneously into the liquid crystal display devices.
Single color transmission light images of the individual
liquid crystal display devices are composed by means of
a dichroic prism or a dichroic mirror, and a thus
composed
