<ABSTRACT>
A soft tissue repair system 10 and method are 
provided. The soft tissue repair system includes a barbed 

suture anchoring member 20 attached to at least one suture 
member 30. A suture retaining member 40 engages the suture 

member such that the length and tension of the suture may 
be selectively adjusted before the suture is permanently 

engaged in the retaining member. In use, the barbed suture 
anchoring member and suture member are inserted into the 

soft tissue repair site and across a tear. The suture 
member extends back through the original entry side of the 

tear. A retaining member is applied to the suture member 
followed by tensioning of the suture member to draw the 

sides of the tear into apposition. Following tensioning, 
the retaining member is permanently affixed to the suture 

member to maintain the selected tension and length of the 
suture member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system and method 
for repairing soft tissue and, more particularly, to a 
system and method for repairing torn meniscal tissue. The surgical repair of soft tissue has typically been 
performed through incisions in the body to expose the area 
under repair followed by the application of sutures, 
staples, or other surgical fasteners. The use of such 
conventional devices typically requires a highly skilled 
surgeon to perform the repair and complete immobilization 
of the surgical area following the repair procedure. More 
recently, the use of arthroscopic and endoscopic techniques 
and equipment has reduced the size and depth of the 
incision required to perform the repair. Surgical repair of cartilage and muscle adjacent a 
joint such as the knee often requires a high degree of 
skill on the part of the surgeon to reduce damage to 
adjacent nerves, blood vessels, cartilage, muscles, and 
tendons. In particular, the repair of the fibrocartilage 
disks within the knee known as the menisci, attached 
peripherally to the joint capsule, requires precision to 
avoid such damage. In the past, meniscal surgery has included procedures 
for partial to complete removal of a torn meniscus, as well 
as attempts to surgically suture, staple, or fasten the 
tear in the meniscus to allow for healing. Other 
techniques have included removal of portions of the 
meniscus to arrest the spread of the tear.  Several devices and procedures have been proposed for 
the repair of meniscal tissue, especially the meniscus of 
the knee. In one arthroscopic procedure, a pair of 
surgical needles are inserted through cannulae into the 
knee on opposite sides of the tear in the meniscus to be 
repaired. The needles are linked by a single suture which 
is pushed down through the cannulae and across the tear. 
An incision is made in the skin at the point where the 
needles exit the knee joint so that the leading edge of 
each needle may be grasped and pulled through the joint. 
After the needles are removed, the ends of the sutures are 
tied outside the skin so that a horizontal suture is 
created in the meniscus. This time-consuming procedure is 
repeated for the placement of as many sutures as necessary 
to repair the meniscal tear. U.S. Patent No. 4,873,976 to Schreiber discloses 
surgical fasteners for repairing tears in body tissue, 
particularly the meniscus of the knee joint. The fastener 
has a base member for seating against the body tissue, a 
shaft upstanding from the base member for
