<ABSTRACT>
An optical glass which is a SiO₂ - Nb₂O₅ - R'₂O (R' 
being an alkali metal element) - F system of a specific 

composition range exhibits optical constants of a 
refractive index (Nd) of about 1.60 or below and an Abbe 

number ( νd) of about 57 - 40, is free of PbO and has an 
improved light transmissivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low refractive flint glass type optical glass of a SiO2 - Nb2O5 - TiO2 - R'2O - F (where R'
is an alkali metal element) having optical constants of a refractive index (Nd) of about 1.60 or below and an Abbe number
(νd) of about 57 - 40.Known in the art are a variety of glasses having these optical constants. These glasses are of a relatively low
refractive and low dispersion property in the property region of flint glasses and have been produced mostly as a SiO2
- PbO system glass. These glasses, however, have a serious drawback of containing a toxic PbO ingredient. For overcoming
this drawback, the specification of USP 3,877,953 discloses a SiO2 - B2O3 - Nb2O5 - K2O system glass and the
specification of USP 4,719,186 disclose a SiO2 - B2O3 - TiO2 - R'2O system glass.Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol. 129, No. 1 to 3, 1991, pages 54 to 63 describes an optical glass consisting
of KF, Nb2O5 and SiO2.EP 0 564 802 A2 discloses a glass being free of Pb and Ba having a high light transmission. Said publication
published on 13 October 1993 discloses the presence of a minimum amount of CaO being 3 % by weight.JP-01133956-A discloses a glass composition for grated index type lens which is obtained by replacing a part of
O2- -ion in a glass composition by 1 to 20 mol.-% of F- -ion. The glass composition comprises by mol.-% 40 to 65
