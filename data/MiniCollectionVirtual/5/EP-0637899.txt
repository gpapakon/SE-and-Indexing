<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electroluminescent arrangement, comprising one or more organic layers, characterized in that at least one of the layers is obtained by thermal or radiation-induced crosslinking, and in that each layer contains at least one charge-transporting connection (compound). The arrangements according to the invention are, for example, very suitable for the production of displays.
