<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, ceramics which are 
prepared by calcining a composition comprising raw ceramic 

materials and a microorganism and/or culture fluid thereof, 
wherein the microorganisms is capable of producing an 

antioxidation material. The ceramic of the present invention 
possesses a variety of activities of, for instance, improving the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a functional ceramic
having a wide variety of biological activities and a process for
preparing the same.Ceramics possessing biological activities are known in
the art.For instance, functional ceramics provided with
activities by controlling the internal physical structure, by
calcining with materials having catalytic functions, or by
adsorbing microbes or catalysts into the pores of porous ceramics
have been proposed.However, most of the conventional functional ceramics,
in general, have a single activity to be aimed. Further, the
activity is sometimes insufficient and may be lost with the
passage of time. Particularly, the ceramics provided with the
activity by adsorbing microorganisms or catalysis, further
improvements are desired in some points. For instance, in the
ceramics the density of microorganisms may vary with the lapse
of time. Moreover, the activity of ceramics may not be stable,
unless environmental conditions, such as pH or temperature are
maintained constant. DE-C-304854 discloses a process for preparation of porous articles from an
inorganic composition, in which yeast or similar organisms are added to produce
gas, giving rise to porosity. The porous products may be used as casting moulds,
in filter materials or as catalyst carriers.Proceedings of the International Conference on Science on Ceramics, Volume 14,
1988, Pages 113-118, relates to methods of treating clay and kaolin raw
materials, using certain fungi and bacteria. Only one microorganism at a time
is used. The effects of these microorganisms on the iron content and plasticity
of clays is discussed.Chemical Abstracts, Volume 106, No. 18, 1987, Abstract No. 142624n, relates
to treatment of ceramic slips with Bacillus mucilaginosus. This is said to
improve the bending strength of tiles after firing and to decrease the water
absorption.An object of the present invention is to provide a functional ceramic which
possesses a wide variety of activities and which is stable and can be used for a
long period of time.The present invention provides a ceramic obtainable by calcining a composition 
comprising raw ceramic materials and a plurality of microorganisms and/or
culture fluid thereof, wherein the microorganisms are selected from each of the
following five groups: actinomycetes, phototrophic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria,
mold fungi and yeast, and wherein the ceramic contains an antioxidation material
derived from the microorganisms.The present invention also provides a process for preparing a
