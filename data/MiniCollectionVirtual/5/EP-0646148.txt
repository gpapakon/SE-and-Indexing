<ABSTRACT>
Novel adhesives for wood composites are described. The adhesives comprise a novel combination of an organosolv lignin and a phenol-formaldehyde resin in a weight ratio of from about 0.5:99.5 to about 70:30 based on the phenolic solids in said phenol-formaldehyde resin. The adhesives further comprise a modifier which improves the performance of the adhesive. Adhesives comprising an organosolv lignin and a liquid phenol-formaldehyde resin are also described. The organosolv lignin solution is comprised in either an alkaline solution or in a dispersion. Adhesives wherein the organosolv lignin is phenolated or methylolated prior to incorporation with the phenol-formaldehyde resin are also described. Wood composites such as plywood, waferboards and oriented strandboards were manufactured using the adhesives of the invention. Results of board testing demonstrate that the wood composites of the invention are competitive with wood composites manufactured using commercial adhesives.

 IMPROVED LIGNIN-BASED WOOD ADHESIVESCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/682,565, filed April 9, 1991 entitled "LIGNIN-BASED WOOD ADHESIVES".BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe pulp and paper industry produces tremendous quantities of kraft and sulfite lignins which, for the most part, are either burnt as fuel in high pressure boilers or discharged as waste with a consequent negative environmental impact. Although wood chemists have for many years addressed the problem of locating useful non- fuel applications for these lignins, currently less than 2% of all lignins available from spent pulping liquors are recovered and marketed for non-fuel uses. Accordingly, there exists a long-standing and ongoing need to implement new, non-fuel ways of effectively using lignin and other biomass by-products.Typical phenol" formaldehyde adhesives which are used in the manufacture of structural wood products such as plywood, waferboard, oriented strandboard and fiberboard contain many constituents in addition to the resin. In the case of plywood, while the resin is the main constituent, various extenders, accelerators, fillers, viscosity control agents and other additives are generally added to the resin to control the properties of the formulation. While some of the added constituents are less costly than the resin itself, phenol-formaldehyde resins are not usually suitable for the formulation of low-value products. Furthermore, since the availability of 

 phenol which is one of the main constituents of phenol- formaldehyde resins, is likely to become a problem as supplies of petroleum feed stocks decline in the future and as phenol's price rises steadily, there is a need to develop substitutes for phenol such as lignin.Much work has been reported on the use of lignins from conventional processes as a component in the formulation of phenol-formaldehyde adhesives. Concentrated waste sulfite liquor has long been known to exhibit certain adhesive properties, and a common approach has been to substitute the spent sulfite liquor for a portion of the phenol in phenol-formaldehyde resins. The substitution is accomplished by pre-reacting the lignin with phenol prior to condensing it with the aldehyde. This approach has generally not been successful because of the poor reactivity of the lignins with phenol- formaldehyde.Another major disadvantage of the use of spent sulfite liquor in adhesive formulations is the high water solubility of the adhesive after curing which
