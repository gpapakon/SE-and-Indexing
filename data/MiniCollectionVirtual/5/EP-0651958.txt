<ABSTRACT>
A device for a tilting mechanism between a chair seat (3) and 
a chair support (4,5), comprising a bearing plate (24) which 

curves upwards and which on the underside thereof has 
stiffening means in the form of a stiffening brace (25). The 

bearing plate (24) is rigidly attached to the support (4,5) 
of the chair, optionally via the stiffening brace (25), and 

the seat (3) can be tilted on the upper side (26) of the 
bearing plate in the longitudinal direction thereof. 

Elastically yielding means (18,19;27;28) are fixed 
either
 
between the underside of the seat (3) and arms (15,16) on the 

stiffening brace, 
or
 between the underside of the seat (3) 
and lugs (22,23) on the chair support (4,5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present device relates to a tilting mechanism which is
placed between a chair seat and a chair support.A number of such tilting mechanisms are previously known, and
in the German patent 3439917 a tilting mechanism is shown and
described wherein the chair seat, on the underside thereof,
on each of the longitudinal sides, is equipped with a wave-shaped
or serrated, curved profile member which interacts with
a correspondingly shaped member located on the support of the
chair. A solution of this kind is rather unsuitable for
stacking chairs or office chairs, since the members which form
engagement with one another require space in the longitudinal
direction of the chair.It is therefore the aim of the present invention to provide
solutions for a tilting mechanism which are placed between a
chair seat and a chair support, and which have a considerably
smaller extension in the longitudinal direction of the chair
than the solution disclosed in the aforementioned German
patent.The tilting mechanism mentioned by way of introduction is characterised,
according to the invention, in that it consists of a bearing
plate which curves upwards and which on its underside is
supported by a stiffening brace, said bearing plate being
rigidly connected to the support of the chair and in such a
way that the chair seat can be tilted on the upwardly curved
upper side of the bearing plate in the longitudinal direction
thereof, and the underside of the chair seat is mechanically
connected to the stiffening brace by means of elastically
yielding means, e.g., helical springs or rubber chocks placed
either on respective arms which project from the stiffening
brace on each long side of the bearing plate, or on lugs which
are fixed to the chair support. The bearing plate may either be connected to the support of
the chair via the stiffening brace, or be attached on the
underside thereof directly to the support of the chair.The invention shall now be described in more detail with
reference to the attached drawings.Fig. 1 illustrates a stacking chair equipped with a tilting
mechanism, according to the invention.Fig. 2 illustrates an office chair equipped with a tilting
mechanism, according to the invention.Fig. 3 is a front view of a first embodiment of the device,
according to the invention.Fig. 4 is a side view of the embodiment illustrated in Fig.

according to the invention.Fig. 6 is a side view of the embodiment illustrated in Fig.

<CLAIMS>
A tilting mechanism which is placed between a
chair seat (3) and a chair support (4,5;11,12), characterised

in that it consists of a bearing plate (20,21;24,26) which curves
upwards and which on the underside thereof is supported by

means of a stiffening brace (17;25), said bearing plate (20,21;24,26)
being rigidly attached to the support of the chair and in such

a way that the chair seat (3) can be tilted on the upwardly
curved upper side of the bearing plate in the longitudinal

direction thereof, and the underside of the chair seat is
mechanically attached to the stiffening brace (17;25) by means

of elastically yielding means, e.g., helical springs (18,19)
or rubber chocks (27;28) placed 
either
 on respective arms
(15;16) which project laterally from the stiffening brace (17;25)

on each long side of the bearing plate, 
or
 on lugs (22,23)
which are secured to the chair support.
A tilting mechanism as disclosed in Claim 1, characterised in that the
bearing plate is connected to the support of the chair via the

stiffening brace.
A tilting mechanism as disclosed in Claim 1, characterised in that the
bearing plate is secured on the underside thereof directly to

the support of the chair.
