<ABSTRACT>
A winding/unwinding device for sheets or generally webs, 
for padding the vault of closed metal constructions, 

especially growing greenhouses and sports facilities, 
comprising separate means for winding/unwinding the 

sheet or web (7), consisting of a shaft (2) to which an extreme 
edge of the sheet or web (7) is secured and said means for 

unwinding the sheet consisting of a second shaft (12) onto 
which one or more ropes (8) can be wound, said ropes (8) being 

coupled by means of springs (29) to a hooking profile (16) 
which is secured to the lower edge of sheet or web (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a winding/unwinding 
device for sheets or generally webs, for padding the 
vault of constructions comprising a metal framework 
which is closed by a sheet or web, especially for 
growing greenhouses and sports facilities. They are known constructions usually having a barrel-vault 
ceiling with a metal framework closed by a web 
which is spread over said framework, which in turn is 
made of tubular or section metal. Said structures are tipically used as growing 
greenhouses or sports facilities. The vaults of said structures are closed with stiff 
padding panels or preferably with variously coloured or 
transparent sheets or webs. In said closed metal constructions, the problem arises 
of the internal microclimate control. The cheapest and most widespread method presently used 
consists in opening/closing apertures on the outer walls 
of said closed metal constructions. Such a solution is often per se not enough in that it  
 
provides a low exchange surface / volume ratio, thereby 
not permitting a quick air replacement. Moreover, such a solution does not easily allow a 
replacement of the upper air layer, which tends to 
remain imprisoned under the vault. It is therefore necessary to provide an opening/closing 
system also on the vault. Stiff panels hinged to the construction are currently 
used on the ridge, said panels being rotated for 
partially opening or closing the upper part of the 
vault. Said solution is not however satisfying in that the 
openings have small dimensions in order to save costs 
and consequently can not provide a quick air 
replacement. Moreover, the stiff panels usually employed besides 
being more expensive, have a higher light absorbance 
value which can be a heavy-weighing draw-back, 
especially for crop protection constructions. A chief object of the present invention is the 
elimination of the above-mentioned draw-backs by 
discovering a device that allows the vaults of closed 
metal constructions to be opened/closed by simply 
winding up, completely or partly, the vault covering 
web.  Another object of the present invention is the 
realization of a device that can be readily and 
unexpensively manufactured. The above and other objects of the invention are 
achieved by a winding/unwinding device for sheets or 
webs for padding the vault of closed metal 
constructions, especially growing greenhouses and sports 
facilities, characterized in that it comprises separate 
means for winding/unwinding the sheet or web. Further features and

<CLAIMS>
A winding/unwinding device for sheets or generally 
webs, for padding the vault of closed metal 

constructions, especially growing greenhouses and sports 
facilities, characterized in that it comprises separate 

means for winding/unwinding the sheet or web. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said means adapted for winding a sheet consist of a 

shaft to which an extreme edge of the sheet or web is 
secured and in that said means for unwinding the sheet 

consist of a second shaft onto which one or more ropes 
can be wound, said ropes being coupled by means of 

springs to a hooking profile 16 which is secured to the 
lower edge of sheet or web 7. 
A device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that it comprises elastic web-tensioning means. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said elastic web-tensioning means comprise a carter with 

an elastic edge, which applies a pressure onto the web, 
and a roller. 
A winding/unwinding device for sheets or generally 
webs, for padding the vault of closed metal 

constructions, especially growing greenhouses and sports 
facilities, characterized in that it comprises: 

a shaft which is arranged over the vault ridge onto 
 

which the web is wound/unwound; 
a profile which slides over the arches that make up the 

vault, said profile being hooked to the lower edge of 
the web; 

motor means for rotating the shaft onto which the web is 
wound / unwound; 

one or more tow lines which are secured, with the 
interposition of springs, to the profile, and pulleys 

for pulling the profile which is fixed to the lower edge 
of the web during the vault closing step; 

a shaft arranged under the vault ridge, onto which the 
tow lines are wound / unwound; 

coupling means between the two shafts that allow them to 
be synchronously driven; 

a protection carter arranged over the vault which covers 
the shaft onto which the web is wound / unwound an end 

of said carter having the function of elastically 
applying a pressure onto the web to keep it tense in 

cooperation with an idle roller onto which said web is 
passed; 

two wind-protection webs, said wind-protection webs 
being arranged simmetrically relative to the 

longitudinal simmetry plane of the structure and 
simmetrically relative to the cross-simmetry plane of 

the construction and covering the slot between the 
 

vault-web and the arch, thereby preventing the wind from 
entering and thereby diverting it moreover upwards. 
A device according to the preceeding claims 
characterized in that it comprises one or more of the 

above described and/or illustrated features.
