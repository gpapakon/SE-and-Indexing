<ABSTRACT>
Peptides having vasopressin antagonist activity 
are prepared by a peptide synthesizer to insert a N-methyl 

arginine at the 7-position of the structure. 

 
An example 

of this series of compounds is [1-(β-mercapto-β,β-cyclo-­
pentamethylenepropionic acid)-2-(O-ethyl-D-tyrosine) -4-­

valine-7-depresoline-8-N-methylarginine-9-desglycine]-­

vasopressin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cyclic peptides which 
have vasopressin antagonist activity whose structures are 
distinguished by having a vasopressin antagonist six unit 
ring with a des-proline-N-methylarginine side chain. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,481,193 and 4,481,194 disclose 
7-des-proline vasopressin antagonists. These compounds do 
not have an N-methyl substituent attached to the arginine 
group. Peptide chemists recognize that N-methylamino 
acid units in a peptide chain exert a conformational 
effect on the preceding amino acid unit. Whether this 
unnatural positioning will exert an influence on 
biological activity is unpredictable. The compounds disclosed in this application have 
been found to retain potent vasopressin antagonist 
activity, in fact, to have enhanced activity when compared 
with the above-mentioned des-N-methyl congeners. In the description herein and in the claims, the 
nomenclature common in the art of peptide and vasopressin 
chemistry is used. When no configuration is noted, the 
amino acid unit is in the L, or naturally occurring, form. 
In certain structural formulas, the thio members of the 
Pmp and Cys units are added for clarity. Certain of the peptide art designations used 
herein are the following: Pmp β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopenta-­
methylenepropionic acid; Tmp, β-mercapto-β,β-cyclotetra-­
methylenepropionic acid; Tyr(Alk), O-alkyltyrosine; Abu, 
a-amino-n-butyric acid; Gly, glycine; Tyr, tyrosine; Phe, 
phenylalanine; Phe(Alk), 4-alkylphenylalanine, Val, 
valine; Ile, isoleucine; MeArg, N-methylarginine; Asn, 
asparagine; Tos, tosylate; BHA, benzhydrylamine; DMAP, 
4-dimethylaminopyridine; DIEA, diisopropylethylamine; HF, 
hydrogen fluoride; 4-MeBzl, 4-methylbenzyl; TFA, trifluoro­
acetic acid; DCC, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; Boc, t-butyl-­ 
 
oxycarbonyl; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; VSP, vasopressin; HBT, 
hydroxybenzotriazole; ACM, acetamidomethyl. In the definitions such as MeArg above, Me denotes 
a methyl located on the amido nitrogen of the peptide unit 
concerned. "Alk" represents a lower alkyl of 1-4 carbons. 
For example, these may be optionally attached to the 
oxygen substituent of a tyrosine unit at position 2, 
especially at the 4′-position of the tyrosine unit, at the 
4′-position of the phenylalanine unit at position 2 or at 
the terminal amido nitrogen (A) of the tail. Such alkyl 
substituents include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or 
butyl. In the 2-tyrosine or 2-phenylalanine units, ethyl 
is preferred. The compounds of the invention are represented by 
the
