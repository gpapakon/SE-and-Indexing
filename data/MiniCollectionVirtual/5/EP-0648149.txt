<ABSTRACT>
In a process for sorting thermoplastic substances from a mixed flow (16) in which the thermoplastic to be sorted is taken to the region of its softening point by convected or radiant heat and then, in its softened state, is taken together with the other materials in the mixture to a grinding device (9), owing to the particle size and elastic behaviour of the softened thermoplastic on the one hand and of the remainder of the materials on the other, only the softened thermoplastic (19) is selectively accepted and ground by the grinding device (9), while the other materials (20) in the mixture pass through the feed and acceptance region of the grinding device (9) and are separately removed in the unground state.

A process for sorting at least one target thermoplastic material 
from a mixture of solids containing a variety of types of 

thermoplastic materials, wherein this, in a mixed stream of solids 
(18) and in a sequence of operating steps using a transporting (13) 

and heating device (14), is first taken to a temperature at which the 
thermoplastic material with the lowest softening point, occasionally 

the target thermoplastic material, is converted into the plastic 
state, after which this is separated from the remaining portion of 

other types of plastic material by sorting,
 
characterised in that
 
the mixed stream of solids (18) emerging from the transporting (13) 

and heating device (14), containing mixed target thermoplastic 
materials in a selectively softened state and other non-softened 

thermoplastic materials, is conveyed, via a chute or under free fall 
with a contact force which can be produced by gravity and/or 

additional acceleration, to the loading and feeding region of a 
shredding device (4, 20) and the portion of softened target 

thermoplastic materials (12, 19, 32) is thereby collected and 
shredded and the remaining non-softened portion of the mixture of 

solids is taken away from the feeding region of the shredding device 
(4, 20) without being shredded. 
A process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
to sort by selectively feeding the target thermoplastic material to 

the shredding device (4, 20), on the one hand the plasticity of the 
target thermoplastic material is adjusted and on the other hand the 

shredding device used (4, 20) is a cutter blade (4) with surfaces 
which have teeth or indentations or knurls.  

 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
shredding of the target thermoplastic material is performed by 

several continuous circulating saw wires or saw bands (24) forming 
a sawing plane (x-x) or by a mill saw (23), wherein these are 

arranged so that the material stream (18) emerging from the 
transporting (13) and heating device (14) is fed to the feed region 

(22) of the saw (23, 24) via a chute (15) or under free fall and the 
cutting angle (ε) of the saws (23, 24), their running direction and/or 

speed and the width of the gap between the individual sawing 
blades are mutually adjusted in accordance with the particle size of 

the mixture of solids and the plastic behaviour of the material 
components in the mixture of solids. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the temperature of the shredding device (4, 20) is controlled during 

operation. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
adhering particles of plastic are removed from the shredding 

devices by scraping devices such as brushes etc. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
several shredding devices (4, 20) are arranged in series in such a 

way that in particular in the case of a saw, several sawing planes 
(x-x) produce rhomboidal passages with each other.  

 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that
 
a twin-shaft cutting machine is used as the shredding device (4, 20) 

which has circular, intermeshing cutter blades (4), arranged on 
shafts parallel to the axis, which form a feed angle (α) and a feed 

depth (h) which depends on this angle (α).
