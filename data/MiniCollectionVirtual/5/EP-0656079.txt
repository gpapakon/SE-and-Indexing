<ABSTRACT>
Fibers having thereon the dried residue of an aqueous coating composition having one or more elastomeric, curable polyurethanes, one or more high molecular weight, high boiling point plasticizers and water have good flexibility and do not need to be preheated before incorporation with matrix polymers. The fibers also have greatly improved adhesion to various types of polymers and better resistance to the effects of water. In addition to the above ingredients for the impregnating coating composition, a number of other optional ingredients may be included. Ingredients such as a crosslinking agent present in an amount to at least partially cure the polyurethane, an emulsifier and/or a microcrystalline wax dispersion may be used. Other common fiber treating chemicals may be present also such as anti-static agents, pigments or dyes, silane coupling agents, fire retardants, etc. After the coating of the sized fibers, the coated fibers can be cured at ambient or elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many coatings and treatments for glass and other fibers have
been developed over the years for use in varying applications of such
fibers, generally for use with polymers where the coated fibers are
incorporated into, encapsulated or surrounded by the polymer.
Coatings and chemically treated fiber bundles were disclosed in U S
4,663,231; 4,762,750 and 4,762,751, among others.During the step of combining the fibers coated according to
the above patents with the polymers as previously mentioned, the
coated fibers are generally preheated. This preheating takes time and
energy and may also cause the release of volatile materials.It is the object of this invention to provide
coated fibers which have greatly improved adhesion to various types of
polymers and better resistance to the effects of water, alkalinity and
acidity and a coating composition for the fibers.The object of the invention is achieved by
a flexible bundle of sized fibers having thereon the dried residue
of an aqueous chemical impregnating and coating composition.
wherein the composition comprises:
(A) at least one elastomeric, curable polyurethane;(B) at least one plasticizer having a boiling point above 225°C
at a pressure of 13.33 mbar (10 mm Hg) in an amount of at
least 15 weight percent of the non-aqueous portion of the
composition; and(C) water in an effective amount to provide an impregnating and
coating composition for the bundle of fibers,
the composition being free of a crosslinking agent for the
polyurethane. The invention further provides
an aqueous chemical impregnating and coating composition
comprising:
(A) at least one elastomeric, curable polyurethane;(B) at least one plasticizer having a boiling point above 225°C
at a pressure of 13.33 mbar (10 mm Hg) in an amount of at
least 15 weight percent of the non-aqueous portion of the
composition; and(C) water in an effective amount to provide an impregnating and
coating composition for a bundle of fibers,
the composition being free of a crosslinking agent for the
polyurethane and the
use of said aqueous coating composition
for coating and impregnating at least a portion of a
fiber bundle, each fiber bundle comprising a plurality of sized fibers.High modulus, low elongation fibers, such as glass fibers, are
used as fibers.After the coating of the sized fibers, the coated fibers can be cured
at ambient or elevated temperatures. Although applicable to other fibers, the invention is
primarily useful with glass fibers. Glass fibers are formed, for
example, by the method mentioned in U
