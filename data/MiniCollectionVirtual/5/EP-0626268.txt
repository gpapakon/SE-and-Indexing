<ABSTRACT>
A printer (17) is provided with at least one 
detachable print unit (30) provided with a driven unit which 

is driven to print an image on a recording sheet. The 
condition of operation of the print unit (30) is detected and 

the detected condition of operation of the print unit is 
stored in a data storage device (20) that allows the updation 

of its contents. Thus, various kinds of information 
useful for the quality control of the printer and the 

print unit (30) can be readily and surely collected and the 
collected information is stored in the print unit. The 

information useful for the quality control of the 
printer and the print unit can be read out from the data 

storage device (20) after the print unit has been removed 
from the printer (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a replaceable 
print unit to be detachably mounted on the main unit of 
a printer, and a printer having a main unit and a 
replaceable print unit detachably mounted on the main 
unit. A printer, such as a thermal printer, is 
provided with a print unit provided with a replaceable 
print head, such as a replaceable thermal print head, 
and detachably mounted on a main unit, because the print 
head is expendable. Referring to Fig. 3 showing a conventional 
thermal printer 1 by way of example, the thermal printer 
1 is assembled by detachably mounting a print unit 30 
having a replaceable thermal print head 2, i.e., a 
driven unit, on a main unit 3. The thermal print head 2 of the thermal 
printer 1 has a plurality of linearly arranged heating 
elements 4, a driving IC (integrated circuit) 5  
 
connected to the heating elements 4, and a connector 6 
connected to the driving IC 5 and to an internal 
connector 11 for electrically connecting the print unit 
30 to a main controller 10 included in the main unit 3 
of the thermal printer 1. The main controller 10 comprises a ROM (read-only 
memory) 7 initially and permanently storing pieces 
of information including control programs, a RAM 
(random-access memory) 8 temporarily storing printing 
data and such and allowing the retrieval of the stored 
data therefrom, and a CPU (central processing unit) 9 
for processing data, connected to the ROM 7 and the RAM 
8. The internal connector 11, a driving mechanism 12 
including a feed motor and such, not shown, a display 13 
for displaying pieces of information including the 
condition of the power source, failure in feeding a 
recording sheet and the like, and an external connector 
14 through which to receive printing data from an 
external apparatus are connected to the main controller 
10. The main controller 10, the driving mechanism 
12 and the associated components of the thermal printer 
1 form a printing system that drives the replaceable 
thermal print head 2 to print an image on a recording  
 
sheet, not shown. A communication cable 16 connected to 
an external apparatus 15, such as a personal computer, 
that provides printing data is detachably connected to 
the external connector 14 of the thermal printer 1. The thermal printer 1 receives printing data 
from the external apparatus 15 through the communication 
cable 16 and stores the same in the RAM 8 of the main 
controller 10. The CPU 9 drives the thermal print head 
2 and the driving mechanism 12 according to the
