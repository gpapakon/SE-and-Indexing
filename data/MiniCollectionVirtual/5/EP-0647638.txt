<ABSTRACT>
A (haloalkyl)dibenzo-onium sulfonate represented by general formula (I). The use of the compound as 
a haloalkylating agent extremely facilitates the separation of the objective water-insoluble haloalkylated organic 

compound in the post-treatment step. The agent can be produced by using an industrially inexpensive raw material, 
since the raw material for synthesis thereof is easily available on an industrial scale or is easy to synthesize.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relate to a new substance named
(haloalkyl)dibenzooniumsulfonate and its production
methods; and a haloalkylating agent and haloalkylating
methods.(Haloalkyl)dibenzoonium salts and their substitution
compounds are useful known haloalkylating agents for organic
compounds [See Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 31, p3579 (1990);
japanese Patent Opening No.197479/91; and J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
Vol. 115, p2156 (1993)].It has, however, turned out that the known (haloalkyl)dibenzoonium
salts and their substituted compounds as
haloalkylating agents cause difficult problems in the post-treatment
process.For example, haloalkylating the sodium salt of 2-methyl-1,
3-cyclopentanedione with (haloalkyl)dibenzothiophenium
trifluoromethanesulfonate simultaneously
generate equivalent dibenzothiophene and sodium
trifluoromethanesulfonate beside 2-(haloalkyl)-2-methyl-1,
3-cyclopentanedione as shown in the following formula. 
formula.
While the latter sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate of
the above-stated products can easily be removed from the
reaction mixture liquid by rinsing it because that substance
is water-soluble, the former dibenzothiophene cannot be
separated through the rinsing process from 2-(haloalkyl)-2-methyl-1,
3-cyclopentanedione to be obtained because both
substances are non-water-soluble.As a result, a very complicated process is required to
separate the dibenzothiophene from the reaction mixture
liquid. This is a serious shortcoming in the prior art for
this type of production.The object of the present inventions is to provide new
compounds suitable for industrial production from cheap
materials by enabling the simpler separation of those 
objective products from haloalkylated substances in the
post-treatment process.To solve the above-stated problem, the inventors have
thoroughly studied an idea of integrating a water-soluble
functional group into a dibenzoheterocycle. As a
consequence, they succeeded in introducing (bonding) a
water-soluble sulfonic acid anion group to a
dibenzoheterocyclic compound. The inventors have thereby
attained the object and created the present inventions.Dibenzoheterocyclic sulfonic acid or its metallic salts
which are produced by haloalkylation by means of the
invented substance as the haloalkylating agent can easily be
separated through the rinsing process because those products
are water-soluble. Dibenzoheterocyclic sulfonic acid or its
metallic salts can also be separated through the simple
filtration process because they are not soluble in
conventional organic
