<ABSTRACT>
An ink guide assembly and ink tank for a dot matrix printer 
head, especially a wire dot matrix printer head, comprises at 

least one ink supply tank (2'') having an ink supply port (41) 
which is arranged to receive ink and transmit ink via the ink 

guide assembly to printing means. An arm (12''d) of an ink 
supply guide (12) is disposed in said ink supply port (41) and 

extends into said ink supply tank. The arm is formed with an 
opening at at least the distal end thereof and with a passage 

extending longitudinally therealong from said opening along the 
length of said arm for conducting ink from said opening toward 

said printing means by at least capillary force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
tank. It is exemplified in this text by an
ink tank for a wire dot matrix printer head. Such a wire
dot macrix printer head has wires supplied with ink at distal
end faces
and movable against a sheet of print paper for
transferring ink to the sheet in the form of dots to
record a character, a figure, a graphic image or the
like on the sheet.An ink supply system for a wire dot matrix printer
is known in which an ink ribbon is not used, but ink is
supplied from an ink tank to the distal ends of the wire
and transferred from the wires directly to a sheet of
print paper. One known ink guide mechanism for such an
ink supply system is disclosed in US-A-4,194,846 and
comprises a porous member capable of absorbing ink from
an ink tank, the ink guide mechanism having wires
contacting the porous member. The porous member
contains fine holes whose sizes or diameters vary in a
certain range, with the result that the ink absorbing
capability varies from porous member to porous member,
and both excessive and insufficient quantities of ink
are liable to be supplied to the distal ends of the
wires. The quantities of ink retained in the vicinity of
the distal ends of the wires differ widely, and the
porous member is liable to vary in dimensions or to be
deformed due to coaction with the sides of the wires.
Consequently, the ink densities of the so-formed dots 
are irregular.EP-A-97,009 discloses another ink supply mechanism
in which ink is supplied from an ink tank to the distal
ends of wires by means of a pump. The ink supply
mechanism of EP-A-97,009 has, however, the disadvantage
that the construction of the connection between the pump
and a printer head is complex and results in increased
cost. It is necessary to provide a good seal so as to
obtain good pump performance, and a large-torque drive
source is required for driving the pump. The ink supply
mechanism is particularly complex in the case of a
multi-colour printer head, and such an ink supply
mechanism is not suitable for use with a small printer
head.In DE-A-2,546,835 there is disclosed a wire dot
matrix printer head comprising an ink tank; a wire
guide means having a portion which is arranged to
receive ink from the ink tank; and a printing wire a
distal end portion of which is mounted in a hole in the
wire guide means, the wire guide means having a
capillary ink path which communicates both with the said
portion of the wire guide means and with a distal end
portion of the printing wire so as to supply ink to the
latter

<CLAIMS>
An ink tank for supplying a proper amount of ink needed to
a dot matrix printer head,


the ink tank comprising a top wall (50), a rectangular
bottom wall (40a) and walls (40b, 40c) extending

therebetween,
an ink supply port (41) which is arranged close to its
shorter side in the bottom wall (40a) to receive ink from

at least one porous member (60", 61, 62), which is
impregnated with ink under subatmospheric pressure and has

substantially no air layer or pocket enclosed by the ink,
the at least one porous member (60"; 61, 62) being arranged
in the ink tank such that only a projecting portion (44),

ridges (47, 51) or a partition wall of at least one wall
(40a, 40b, 40c, 50) contacts the at least one porous member

(60"; 61, 62) so that the remaining portion of the at least
one wall (40a, 40b, 40c, 50) is spaced at a distance from

the at least one porous member (60"; 61, 62) and that an
air hole (42) in one of the ink tank walls communicates air

in the space with ambient air,
and the at least one porous member (60") is compressed in
the tank in the vicinity of said ink supply port (41).
Ink tank according to claim 1 characterized in that said
ink supply tank (2") is formed as a detachably mounted

unit, said ink supply tank (2") being formed with a 
plurality of ink-supply sections, each of said ink-supply

sections having an ink-supply delivery port, each of said
ink-supply sections containing an ink absorbing member

(60"; 61, 62) formed by said porous member and impregnated
with ink, and at least two of said ink-supply sections

carrying ink of different colors.
Ink tank according to claim 1 characterized in that said
unitary ink supply tank is formed with a plurality of ink-supply

sections, each of said ink-supply sections having an
ink supply port, said unitary ink supply tank containing an

ink absorbing member in each of said ink-supply sections
formed by the porous member and impregnated with ink, at

least two of said ink-supply sections carrying ink of
different colors, said ink in said ink-supply sections

being of a color other than black; and

a further separate ink-supply tank formed with an ink
supply port, a separate ink absorbing member formed of a

porous material contained within said separate ink-supply
tank and impregnated with ink, the ink contained in said

separate ink supply tank being black.
Ink tank as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 2 or
3, characterized in that the ink absorbing member (60") has

a tapered portion (60"').
Ink tank as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the ink absorbing member (60") has a thicker portion in the

vicinity of the ink supply port (41).
Ink tank as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the porous member (60"; 61, 62) has

pores therein which increase in size with distance from the
ink supply port (41).
