<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an endomedullar 
nail for reducing the proximal femur 

fractures, which nail comprises an insert or infibulum 
element (1) of elongated shape, which can be introduced 

into the femur bone and has an elliptical 
section at the proximal region. 
The infibulum is provided, in its proximal 
portion, with two holes (4,5) which are parallel to one 

another and slanted with respect to the axis of the 
proximal portion, for introducing a stabilizing 

cervical screw (10) and a bearing cervical screw (11) having 
a diameter larger than that of the stabilizing 

cervical screw.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an endomedullar 
nail for reducing the proximal femur fractures, 
and also relates to an apparatus for locating said 
nail. As is known, in the case of a fracture of 
the proximal portion of the femur bone, it is frequently 
necessary or anyhow advisable to adopt reducing 
or synthesis means allowing to hold the fracture 
portions at a mutually suitable position and, 
moreover, for properly transmitting the loads through 
the traumatized region. The synthesis or reducing means which are 
at present used conventionally comprise outer fixing 
elements, metal plates to be connected to bone 
screws, and insert or infibulum elements to be arranged 
inside the medullar channel. With respect to prior insert or infibulum 
elements, they are affected by great coupling problems, 
because of the difficulty of properly locking 
against rotation the infibulum with respect to 
the femur bone, while holding the infibulum properly 
arranged with respect to the bone.  Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, by 
providing an endomedullar nail which can be firmly 
anchored in the involved bone region, while preventing 
radial compression stresses from being transmitted 
to the femur bone. Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, 
a main object of the present invention is to provide 
such an endomedullar nail which can properly 
stabilize a diaphisary region of the femur, with 
respect to the proximal region thereof. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such an endomedullar nail which is also 
adapted to prevent rotary movements as well as other 
displacements of the femur bone portions to be reunited. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide an apparatus which allows to apply 
the endomedullar nail to the femur bone with a very 
great accuracy, and also affords the possibility 
of properly applying all of the stabilizing means. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as well  
 
as yet other objects, which will become more apparent 
hereinafter, are achieved by an endomedullar 
nail for reducing the proximal femur fractures, 
characterized in that said nail comprises an infibulum 
which can be inserted into the medullar channel 
of the femur bone and having an elliptical section 
at the proximal region, said infibulum being 
further provided, at the proximal portion thereof, 
with two parallel holes which are slanted with respect 
to the axis of the

An endomedullar nail for reducing the 
proximal femur fractures, characterized in that 

said nail comprises an infibulum which can be inserted 
into the medullar channel of the femur bone 

and having an elliptical section at the proximal 
region, said infibulum being further provided, at 

the proximal portion thereof, with two parallel 
holes which are slanted with respect to the axis 

of the proximal portion, for engaging therein a 
stabilizing cervical screw and a bearing cervical 

screw respectively. 
An endomedullar nail, according to the 
preceding claim, characterized in that said bearing 

cervical screw has a diameter larger than the diameter 
of said stabilizing cervical screw. 
An endomedullar nail, according to the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said infibulum 

is provided with an axial recess extending 
for the overall length of said infibulum. 
An endomedullar nail, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said infibulum, at the distal end portion thereof, 
 

is provided with a throughgoing hole as well 
as with a fork portion. 
An endomedullar nail, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said infibulum is provided, at the proximal 
end portion thereof, with an uneven polygonal seat 

which can be coupled to an operating handle element. 
An apparatus for locating an endomedullar 
nail according to the preceding claims, characterized 

in that said apparatus comprises an operating 
handle to be engaged in an uneven polygonal 

seat defined at the proximal end portion of an infibulum, 
and being moreover provided an affixing 

cannulated screw which can be engaged in said seat, 
said operating handle defining a contoured end portion 

which can be engaged in the seat of a guide 
element defining throughgoing slanted holes, parallel 

to one another, for housing therein tubular 
guides and for engaging therein distal screws. 
An apparatus, according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that said apparatus further comprises 

a screw-driver, engageable in a tubular guide, and 
provided with a threaded stem which can be coupled 

 
with said bearing cervical screw and connected to 

an operating wheel for operating said bearing cervical 
screw, there being moreover provided a pulling 

nut, which is rotatably supported by said screw-driver 
and abutting on said first tubular guide. 
An apparatus, according to Claims 6 and 
7, characterized in that said stabilizing cervical 

screw is provided, at an intermediate portion thereof, 
with a tapering portion adjoining a threaded 

portion, said tapering portion being adapted to be 
arranged near a cortical portion of the femural 

bone head in order to cut the screw to provide a 
thread for the connection with means for withdrawing 

the screws upon consolidation of the bone fracture.
