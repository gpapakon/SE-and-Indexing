<ABSTRACT>
A side loading refuse vehicle (10) having a wheel assembly (11) supporting a cab (12) and a chassis (13), a storage tank (14) having two tank sections (15 and 16) is mounted on the chassis (13). A hopper (17) having a loading aperture (18) is located behind the cab (12), the hopper is adapted to receive refuse from a loading mechanism (19) adjacent the hopper so that the contents of a multi-compartment bin (20), which in this case includes a central divider partition (21) shown in phantom in Figure 1, can be partially inverted over the hopper (17) so that the contents of the bin (20) are diverted into the respective tank sections (15 and 16) by the refuse transfer mechanism in the hopper (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a refuse vehicle and in particular, to a side
loading refuse vehicle and more particularly, but not limited to, an automated
side loading refuse vehicle for simultaneous collection, but separate storage of
garbage and/or recyclable wastes in the one vehicle.With the introduction of environmental awareness, the collection of
domestic garbage has taken on a new complexion, it being realised that new,
convenient and economical approaches to garbage collection and recycling must
be introduced. It has been proposed to provide householders with a plurality of
waste bins so that each householder can sort waste into various categories.For example, paper, metal cans and bottles and garbage could conceivably
be stored and collected separately and this has been tried, the main problem with
this scheme is the high expense insofar as separate collections are required for
each category.The alternative has been to provide local or regional sorting facilities where
garbage is hand sorted or expensive automated facilities have been tried with
minimal success due to the high expense involved.In summary therefore, sorting of recyclables from domestic garbage after
collection is generally uneconomical.It has been proposed to provide divided bins and divided collection
vehicles to collect garbage arid recyclables presorted by the householder.
DE-A-4024568 to Borchers describes such a vehicle.Another arrangement is described in DE-A-3537546 where in this case a
divided vehicle receiving waste from undivided bins selecting delivery waste into
selected compartments in the vehicle.Other typical divided vehicles are described in US-A-5,035,565 and EP-A-356833.The prior art divided vehicle systems were cumbersome and inefficient
with emphasis being placed on collection rather than improving the efficiency of
the collection. The present invention has, as its primary object, to provide a useful
alternative to the aforementioned prior art.In one aspect, the present invention resides in a side loading refuse vehicle
having a forward end, opposed sides and a rearward end, a driver's cab in front
of an elongate storage tank and a loading mechanism for emptying a divided bin
into the vehicle, the storage tank being divided into separate upper and lower
storage regions, an entrance passageway being provided behind the cab and in
front of the storage regions the entrance passageway having means maintaining
separate first and second streams of refuse received simultaneously from a divided
bin, the upper storage
