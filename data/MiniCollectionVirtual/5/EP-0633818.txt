<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sintered ferrous materials,
products made therefrom and to a method for their manufacture.Machining of articles produced by a powder metallurgy route is
often a significant part of the manufacturing cycle. Good
machinability of an article is important as this increases tool
life and reduces tooling-associated down-time during
manufacturing. Valve guides for internal combustion engines, for
example, are usually finish-machined by reaming after fitting in
the cylinder head by the engine manufacturer who demands good
machinability of the guide.It has been found that in materials having relatively poor
machinability that the working surface may be smeared by the
cutting tool, resulting in closing-up or in a reduction of the
surface porosity. The presence of open surface porosity is
frequently used in sintered materials to provide a reservoir for
the retention of lubricating oil in order to improve the antiseizure
or scuffing wear resistance of the material and so
increase durability of the material or article. Furthermore, it
has been found in some circumstances that a smeared surface
results in a relatively low surface roughness value and which may
deleteriously affect the wear resistance of articles such as
valve guides when running against a smooth counterface such as
a valve stem, for example. Powder metallurgy articles are generally manufactured by
pressing from a mixture of powders which may be elemental
powders or pre-alloyed powders or a combination of both,
followed by sintering. The powder mixture frequently
includes additions to promote or enhance desired
characteristics or properties of the powder mixture itself
and/or the resulting sintered material. In the case of
machinability, small additions of materials which act as
"chip breakers" are frequently made, the most common of
which is manganese sulphide. Such additions cause the cut
material to break up into chips by shearing, reducing
cutting load and the likelihood of build-up of material on
the cutting edge of the tool. Additions such as manganese
sulphide assist the machinability of the material, but
however, have substantially little other beneficial effects
on the strength or wear resistance, for example, of the
sintered material.Machinability may also be affected by other factors
including the amount and distribution of ductile phases
which may promote build-up of material on the tool during
machining.JP-A-56136953 describes the addition of powder particles to
