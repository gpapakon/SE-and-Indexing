integrally joined thereto. The airfoil 24 includes an inner portion 24a disposed adjacent to 

the dovetail 38 to provide a structural transition, and an outer portion 24b disposed 
thereabove for effecting a pressure rise in airflow channeled thereacross. A nosepiece 40 

is disposed adjacent to the leading edge 26 of the airfoil inner portion 24a, and a tailpiece 
42 is disposed adjacent to the trailing edge 28 of the airfoil inner portion 24a. The 

nosepiece 40, tailpiece 42, and airfoil inner portion 24a are collectively aerodynamically

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to rotor blades therein. Commercial passenger-carrying aircraft are typically powered by high bypass 
turbofan gas turbine engines for propelling the aircraft at subsonic speeds. A portion of 
inlet air is pressurized by a fan and bypasses the core engine for providing a majority of the 
thrust from the engine during operation. The remaining portion of the inlet air is channeled 
through the core engine wherein it is compressed, mixed with fuel, and ignited for 
generating combustion gas from which energy is extracted for powering the core engine and 
the fan. The fan size, or outer diameter thereof, is a primary factor in the maximum thrust 
capability of the engine. Larger fan diameter allows increased propulsion thrust from the 
engine, but also increases size and weight of the engine which adversely affect fuel burn 
by decreasing specific fuel consumption (SFC). Uninstalled SFC may be improved for 
subsonic turbofan engines as fan pressure ratio is reduced. However, as fan pressure ratio 
is reduced the airflow through the fan must increase to retain the required maximum thrust 
from the engine. This, in turn, requires a larger diameter fan which increases engine weight 
and increases nacelle scrubbing and interference drag. These effects diminish the 
uninstalled advantage of a low fan-pressure ratio engine to the point that when the engine 
is installed in the aircraft the overall efficiency of operation is diminishingly reduced. Various types of fan arrangements are known and include, for example, fan blades 
having mid-span shrouds which radially divide the airflow into outer and inner portions, with 
the inner portion undergoing compression in a booster compressor for increasing the overall 
propulsion efficiency of the engine for obtaining improved SFC. However, the blade mid-span 
shrouds are typically integrally joined to the blade which requires a more complex and 
expensive manufacturing process. Furthermore, the additional centrifugal loads from the 
mid-span shroud must be carried through the blade dovetail and into the rotor disk which  
 
must be suitably sized for obtaining acceptable stress for a useful life. More specifically, the blade includes an airfoil which is conventionally 
aerodynamically configured for obtaining a suitable pressure rise in the airflow channeled 
thereover during operation, with the airfoil ending at a root integrally formed with the 
dovetail which secures the blade to
