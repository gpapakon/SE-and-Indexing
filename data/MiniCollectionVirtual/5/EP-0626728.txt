<CLAIMS>
Integrated circuit of the type having a substrate or well
of a first doping type (P) and in this substrate or well:


a first doping diffusion of a second type (N
+
) in the form of
a bar (1) of length Lb and width e, provided at its two ends

(2, 3) with first (A) and second (B) connection terminals;
a polysilicon sheet (4) which entirely covers the bar (1)
with the exception of the connection terminals and having an

extension which forms a third connection terminal (D);
a second doping diffusion (5) of the second type (N
++
) auto-aligned
by the polysilicon sheet (4) and provided with a fourth

connection terminal (F);

the integrated circuit thus made up forming a quadripole A, B,
D, F of the type with a resistor, capacitor and transistor.
Integrated circuit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the bar (1) is linear.
Integrated circuit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the bar (1) is wound in a helix.
Integrated circuit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
tha
t
 the bar (1) is folded in a coil.
Integrated circuit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the bar (1) is less doped (N

++
)
diffusion (5). 
Method of manufacturing an integrated circuit in a
substrate or well of a first doping type, 
characterised in that

it includes the following steps:

the production of a bar of non auto-aligned diffusion of a
second type (1);
the formation of a gate oxide in an aperture wider than the
bar, delimited by thick oxide;
the production of a polysilicon sheet (4) which entirely
covers the diffusion bar with the exception of the connection

terminals;
the production of a diffusion of the second type (5), this
diffusion being auto-aligned by the polysilicon sheet and

delimited by the thick oxide;
the connection of each end of the bar to a first connection
terminal A and to a second connection terminal B;
the connection of the auto-aligned diffusion to a third
connection terminal (F);

second logic state as an output for an input voltage less than
the detection threshold.
Relaxation oscillator according to Claim 7, 
characterised
in that
 the output stage has a first low/high voltage threshold
(V1) and a second high/low voltage threshold (V2).
