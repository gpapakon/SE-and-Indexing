<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to dissimilar arm asymmetric
radial or star block copolymers.
More particularly, the invention is related to adhesive and sealant compositions
containing asymmetric block copolymers which have both hydrogenated
and unhydrogenated sets of arms.Block copolymers have been employed in adhesive compositions
for many years, primarily because of their high cohesive strengths
and their ability to crosslink without a chemical vulcanization
step. Block copolymers such as those described in U.S. Patent No.
3,239,478 are either linear or radial or star styrene-butadiene or
styrene-isoprene block copolymers. The high cohesive strength of
these polymers is often a detrimental quality in certain
applications. In the past, cohesive strength was reduced by adding
a styrene-isoprene diblock copolymer to the primary block copolymer
to lower the cohesive strength and give less elasticity and better
conformability.From European patent application no. 0516203 block copolymers
were known of the structure (A-B-Ap)-Yr-(Aq-B)m wherein A and B were
polymer blocks of butadiene or isoprene monomers or copolymer blocks
of butadiene or isoprene and styrene monomers and wherein the A
blocks had a greater number of tertiary unsaturation (TU) sites per
unit of block mass than did the B blocks and wherein the A blocks
had a molecular weight form 100 to 3000 and preferably from 300 to
2000 and B blocks had a molecular weight from 1000 to 15,000 and
preferably from 2000 to 10,000, and wherein p and q were 0 or 1 and
n > 0, r = 0 or 1, m ≥ 0 and n + m ranges from 1 to 100, or block
copolymers comprising at least one block which comprised
predominantly butadiene or isoprene and at least one block
comprising predominantly styrene monomer units, wherein the blocks
of butadiene or isoprene had molecular weights of between 300 and
200,000 and the blocks comprising predominantly styrene monomer 
units had molecular weights between 500 and 50,000.Said block copolymers contain epoxidised diene blocks, which
were crosslinked through at least some of the epoxy functionality by
exposure to radiation and had sufficient gel content to provide
increased resistance to temperature and/or organic solvents. The
polymers preferably were partially hydrogenated such that only from
0.1 to 5 Meq. of aliphatic double bonds per gram of polymer remain
in the polymer and contain before crosslinking from 0.1 to 5 Meq. of
epoxide per gram of polymer.In particular a polymer comprising
predominantly a partially hydrogenated and epoxidised
