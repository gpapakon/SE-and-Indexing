<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to pharmacologically 
active pyrrolidinone derivatives, to synthetic method 
therefor and to pharmaceutical compositions containing 
them. More particularly, the invention refers to 
compounds having the following general formula: 
 
wherein X is hydrogen or an OR group, wherein R has one of 
the following meanings: hydrogen C₂-C₇ acyl, saturated or 
unsaturated C₁-C₆ alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl or phenyl, n 
represents zero or 1 and m represents 2 or 3. According to the invention, the compounds I are 
obtained by aminolysis of compounds of formula II with 
L-prolinol-aminoalkyl derivatives III, according to the 
scheme A: 
 
 
wherein X′ has the meanings already stated for X, except 
those of acyloxy residue, and may moreover represent a 
CH₃OCH₂O- or CH₃OCH₂CH₂O- residue; R is a lower alkyl 
residue, preferably methyl or ethyl; n and m are as above 
defined. The formation of the amide bond described in the 
scheme A may be carried out also by activating the carboxy 
group of compounds IV, by reaction with N,N′-carbonyldi­
imidazole (NCDI) or with 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-­
dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), and subsequent condensation with 
(III) (scheme B): 
 
wherein Y represents 
 
whereas X, 
n and m are as above defined. The acids IV or the esters II, wherein X is H, OH, 
alkoxy or acyloxy are known compounds (for X = H cfr D.E. 
Butler and coll. J. Med. Chem., 27 684 (1984); for X = OH  
 
and X = OCOCH₃ cfr G. Pifferi and M. Pinza, U.S.P. 4, 118, 
396). The synthesis of L-prolinol-N-aminoalkyl derivati­
ves III is carried out according to the scheme C (m = 2) 
or D (m = 3): 
The compounds of the invention show a very intere­
sting activity on the Central Nervous System: they have 
been tested in comparison to controls and to a known com­
pound having similar structure and pharmacological beha­
viour, i.e. Piracetam or 2-(pyrrolidin-2-one)acetamide. 
The compounds have been tested, for the memory and learn­
ing, in the following way:  The experimental method was substantially that 
described by Fuxe and Hanson "Central catecholamine neu­
rons and conditioned avoidance behaviour" (Psychopharmaco­
logie, 11, 439-447, 1967), i.e. the "Shuttle box" method. A perspex cage 60×30×20 cm, divided in two compart­
ments by a diaphragm, has been used. The bottom of the cage is provided by an electri­
fiable adjustable grid. A luminous and sonorous signal is 
provided in each compartment. In the learning test, each rat is subjected to a 
cycle of 20 attempts during which the animal
