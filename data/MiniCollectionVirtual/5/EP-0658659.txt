<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a device for introducing an injection fluid (2) into parts (9) of structures, in particular for repair purposes, the injection fluid (2) being channelled out of a container (1), by means of a feed line (7), into bores (8) which are made in the structural parts (9) such that they are directed obliquely downwards at a distance from one another. The invention is characterized in that the container (1) for the injection fluid (2) exhibits a filling mark (3), in that the feed line (7) is guided out essentially obliquely downwards beneath the filling mark (3), in that the feed line (7) is adjoined within the container (1) by a downwardly guided siphon line (4) for the injection fluid (2), in that there is provided on the container (1) a means (7) for securing the same, and in that the container (1) is retained such that it is arranged essentially beneath the opening (11) of the bore (8), but its filling mark (3) is located above the opening (11) of the bore (8). The device is of a very simple construction, is easy to handle and makes it possible to carry out an injection operation, without sealance between the bore (8) and the feed line (7), without the risk of overflow and without monitoring, until impregnation is achieved or also in a metered manner.

A device for applying an injection fluid (2) into the structural members (9) 
of structures, especially for treatment purposes, wherein the injection fluid 

(2) can be introduced from a container (1) into drill holes using a feed line, 
with the said drill holes drilled in the structural member (9) at a distance 

apart and sloping downwards, 
characterised in that
 the container (1) for the 
injection fluid (2) has a fill mark (3), that the feed line (7) when in situ is 

guided outwards in a substantially downward sloping direction below the fill 
mark (3), that in situ a downwardly-extending siphon line (4) for the 

injection fluid (2) is connected to the feed line (7) within the container (1), 
that a means (7) is provided on the container (1) for holding it in place and 

that the container (1) can be held in place by this means so that it is 
substantially arranged below the opening (11) of the drill hole (8), but with 

its fill mark (3) lying above the opening (11) of the drill hole (8). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the feed line (7) forms 
the means for holding the container (1) in place and is preferably 

manufactured from a rigid material. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the siphon line (4) is guided in the container (1) to a point just above the 

container base (6). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the container base (6) slopes downwardly towards the siphon line (4) when 

in situ. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
lower end (10) of the feed line (7) is guided to a point below the lower end 

(5) of the siphon line (4).  
 
A method for applying an injection fluid (2) into the structural members (9) 
of structures, especially for treatment purposes, using a device according to 

any one of the preceding claims, wherein the injection fluid (2) is introduced 
from a container (1) into drill holes (8) using a feed line (7), with the said 

drill holes drilled in the structural member (9) at a distance apart and sloping 
downwards, characterised in that the injection fluid (2) is withdrawn from 

the container (1) using the siphoning principle, with the container (1) filled 
up to a fill mark (3) at the start of withdrawal of injection fluid (2) and 

withdrawal proceeding via a siphon line (4) arranged within the container (1) 
and to which is connected, beneath the fill mark (3) for the injection fluid 

(2), a feed line (7) leading out of the container (1) and extending 
substantially downward-sloping into one of the drill holes (8), and that the 

container (1) is substantially arranged below the opening (11) of the drill 
hole (8) at the height of the drill hole (8), but with its fill mark (3) lying 

above the opening (11) of the drill hole (8). 
A method according to claim 6, characterised in that the cross-section of the 
container (1) is dimensioned such that its fill mark (3) is arranged so that the 

wall (9) in the region of the drill hole (8) is saturated with injection fluid (2) 
before the fluid level in the container (1) reaches the lower end (5) of the 

siphon line (4) arranged there.
