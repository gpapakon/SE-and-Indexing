<ABSTRACT>
The moisture sensor comprises a block of absorbent material, such as wood. Two opposed faces are coated with conductive material, such as conductive paint and two conductors of a cable are connected to the conductive material. The entire element is encapsulated within a sleeve of electrically insulating material, leaving one end face of the block of moisture absorbent material exposed. A plurality of apertures or perforations are provided in the sleeve exposing at least part of the moisture absorbent material. The sensor is adapted to be exposed to an evironment to sense the moisture level of that environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to a moisture sensor 
and more particularly to a moisture sensor adapted to be 
used to sense the moisture content within wood, although 
the sensor of the invention may find other applications. A moisture sensor is known from DE-A-3 538 463. It is to be appreciated that the performance and 
durability of wood is dependent upon its moisture content. 
It is thus desirable to be able to measure the moisture 
content of wood. Many moisture meters have been proposed previously 
which can measure the moisture content of wood, but most of 
these meters rely on inserting two prongs or electrodes 
into the wood, and then measuring the electrical resistance 
between the prongs or electrodes. Such a technique is very prone to error, since the 
electrical resistance between the prongs depends upon the 
degree of insertion into the wood, the nature of any paint 
provided on the exterior of the wood, and many other 
similar factors. Also such moisture meters can only be 
used to determine the moisture of wood where access can be 
gained to the surface of the wood. The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
moisture sensor. According to this invention there is provided a 
moisture sensor, the sensor comprising an elongate element 
of moisture absorbent material presenting two opposed side 
faces, the two opposed side faces being provided with 
conductive material extending over a predetermined area 
thereof, there being a cable having two conductors which 
are connected respectively to the areas of electrically  
 
conductive material, the element being encapsulated within 
a sleeve of electrically insulating material, the sleeve 
being such that an end face of the sensor is exposed, there 
being a plurality of apertures or perforations in the 
sleeve exposing at least part of the element, the sensor 
being adapted to be exposed to an environment, the moisture 
level of which is to be sensed by the sensor. Preferably the apertures or perforations are 
provided at the ends of bores extending through the 
element. Conveniently the bores extend through parts of the 
element which are not provided with said conductive 
material. Preferably the electrically conductive material is 
in the form of conductive paint, such as a silver paint. Advantageously the conductors of the cable are 
secured or bonded to the conductive material. Advantageously the absorbent material is wood. Conveniently the absorbent material has a size 
which is approximately 1.8mm by 1.8mm by 8mm. The sleeve may
