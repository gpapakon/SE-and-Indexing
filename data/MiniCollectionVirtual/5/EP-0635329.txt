<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed solder-desolder system includes an electrically heated 
soldering tip (90) which is a hollow tube (92) through which molten solder may 

be removed from the workpiece by a steady inward flow of air or by a strong 
impulse, vacuum stroke. Also supplied to the workpiece is a flow of solder 

melting hot gas which may be inert for improved soldering performance. The 
hot gas is directed over the heated soldering tube and may independently melt 

the solder or it may be utilized to preheat the work. In any event, the 
system provides in a compact hand held soldering tool a jet of hot air within 

which is a hot soldering tube tip (90) within a vacuum flow removes molten 
solder from the workpiece.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of electrical soldering /desoldering 
tools and, more particularly, to such instruments which in part utilize a stream of gas and 
in part metallic conduction to convey heat from its source along a path to the soldering 
point, the term "hand held" being intended to include robotic or robot-like applications. 
The term "gas" as used here usually means ambient air, but may include inert or relatively 
inert gases such, for example, as carbon dioxide or nitrogen or the noble gases or the like 
as when oxidations, corrosive reactions, or other undesired chemical action is to be 
minimized. The advantages of hot gas soldering have become known and understood in recent 
years and are discussed in detail in Applicant's United States Patents: HOT AIR 
SOLDERING AND RESOLDERING SYSTEM, US-A-4, 926, 028; and HOT GAS 
SOLDERING SYSTEM, US-A-5, 054, 106. 
by this applicant.  
 In particular US-A-5,054,106 discloses a soldering 
system which utilizes a fine jet of very hot gas as the 
means for heating the work point. The hot air may impinge 
directly on the work point or it may heat a soldering tip 
from within whereby it may be used in a more conventional 
mode of soldering or desoldering. Means for supplying a 
regulated flow of gas to the heater of the soldering 
instrument is shown and the gas may be somewhat preheated 
by passing along the lead carrying the electric power to 
the heating element. The same supply of air may also be 
used to cool the handle of the soldering instrument for 
operator comfort and safety. The temperature of the 
heating element is remotely electronically controlled by a 
time share use of the power leads as temperature sensing 
and feedback means. In one embodiment of US-A-5,054,106, the forward end 
of a heater assembly includes a metal sheath terminated at 
its forward end by a reduced diameter portion formed with 
pressed threads manifest on both its inner and outer 
surfaces. A retainer bushing is threaded into the inner of 
the threads until its forward larger diameter portion is 
tight against the end of the metal sheath. A central bore 
retains the forward enlarged diameter end of a gas 
circulator tube. A threaded nozzle tip is screwed onto the 
outer of the threads to retain the flanged tube tightly  
 
against and within the retainer bushing. Most of the length of the circulator tube is wrapped 
with a heat exchange enhancing filamentary element in the 
form of a metallic spring wound snugly about its outer 
surface. This
