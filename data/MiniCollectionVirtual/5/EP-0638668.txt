<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a plated steel sheet with a Zn-Cr alloy 
plating which is excellent in adhesion properties. Zinc plating has sacrificing corrosion protecting 
property for steel sheets. The sacrificing corrosion 
protecting property is exhibited under environments in a 
variety of applications. Zinc-plated steel sheets have 
been used in various fields of automobiles, home 
appliances, and construction materials as major application 
fields of steel sheets. In recent years, however, strong demand has arisen 
for further improving the corrosion resistance property 
of zinc-plated steel sheets, and particularly, electrical 
zinc-plated steel sheets mainly in the field of 
automobiles. To meet this demand, a steel sheet with a 
zinc alloy plating of, e.g., Zn-Ni or Zn-Fe has been 
developed, and its production quantity has been 
increasing. This steel sheet has become a major one of 
all steel products. Attempts have been made to improve the properties 
of steel sheets with zinc alloy platings. In 
particular, it is reported that the corrosion resistance 
property of steel sheet with Zn-Cr alloy plating is 
excellent (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
Nos. 63-243295 and 1-162794). There are also proposed 
methods of manufacturing steel sheet with Zn-Cr alloy  
 
plating (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
Nos. 64-79393, 3-120393, and 64-55398). Electrical zinc-plated steel sheets (including 
plated steel sheets with its various alloys) are generally 
manufactured using an acidic plating bath such as a 
sulfuric acid bath or a hydrochloric acid bath. In the 
manufacture of a plated steel sheet with a Zn-Cr alloy 
plating, this plated steel sheet cannot be obtained if 
chromium ions are simply added to such an acidic plating 
bath. According to Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 1-79393, it is described that Zn-Cr plating can be 
performed in a plating bath containing only zinc and 
chromium ions (partially including inorganic salts) at a 
high current density of 150 A/dm2 or more. Inspite of 
this, at present, electrical zinc platings (including 
zinc alloy platings) are generally manufactured at a 
current density of 50 to 150 A/dm2, and it is difficult 
to apply a high current density of 150 A/dm2 or more in 
practice. Moreover, in plating at a high current 
density, diffusion of metal ions subjected to plating 
cannot generally follow up the plating rate. The hydrogen 
ions are subjected to a reducing reaction instead, 
and the pH of a portion near the
