<ABSTRACT>
A retail terminal has a housing (34) including a front cash till portion (30) 
with a lid (36) hinged to the housing (34), a keypad (20) being mounted on the 

lid (36). The terminal employs a flexible circuit (46) instead of a printed circuit 
board to facilitate mounting the keypad (20) on the lid (36). A rear portion (44) 

of the housing (34) contains a controller (12) connected to the keypad (20) by 
the flexible circuit (46), a liquid crystal display (14) coupled to the controller 

(12), and receipt and journal printers (16) coupled to the controller (12). The 
terminal may also include a circuit (24) for wirelessly communicating with a 

host system (22), and a solar panel and battery means for remote operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retail terminals. Known retail terminals typically include cash drawers to leave room on 
top of the terminal for a keypad. Such terminals include printed circuit boards 
within the terminal which are connected to printers, displays, and other built-in 
peripherals. Due to their size and weight, such terminals are typically not 
portable. Thus, they are not well suited for use in retail environments other 
than checkout stands. It is an object of the invention to provide a retail terminal which is 
lightweight and portable. According to the present invention there is provided a retail terminal 
including a housing having a controller mounted therein, characterized in that 
the housing includes a front cash till portion with a movable lid, and in that 
there are provided a keypad mounted on the lid, and a flexible circuit for 
coupling the controller to the keypad. It is a feature of a retail terminal in accordance with the present invention 
that a flexible circuit is used instead of a printed circuit board to facilitate 
mounting the keypad on the lid. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a retail terminal in accordance with the 
present invention; Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the retail terminal shown in block diagram 
form in Fig. 1; and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the terminal of Fig. 2, with the lid of the 
terminal raised, showing the cash till. Referring now to Figs. 1-3, the retail terminal 10 shown therein includes 
a controller 12, and peripherals such as a display 14, printers 16, a power 
supply 18, and a lid-mounted keypad 20. The controller 12 executes retail programs and controls the peripherals. The display 14 is preferably a liquid crystal display for displaying 
primarily price information and messages from the controller 12. The printers 16 include a receipt printer and a journal printer. The power supply 18 may regulate power from alternating or direct 
current sources, or it may be a light-to-electrical converter such as a solar panel,  
 
and batteries for portable operation. The power supply 18 may include a 
converter 19 which converts alternating current to direct current. The keypad 20 provides keypad functions which are utilized by the 
controller 12. Such functions are implemented by simple numerical keys and 
specific function keys. The retail terminal 10 may operate as a standalone unit or may operate as 
a
