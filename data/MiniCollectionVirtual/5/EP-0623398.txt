<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and a 
method for controlling flow control means for controlling 
the air flow through a fume hood. Fume hoods are utilized in various laboratory 
environments for providing a work place where potentially 
dangerous chemicals are used, such a hood comprising an 
enclosure having moveable doors at the front portion 
thereof which can be opened in various amounts to permit 
a person to gain access to the interior of the enclosure 
for the purpose of conducting experiments and the like. 
The enclosure is typically connected to an exhaust system 
for removing any noxious fumes so that the person will 
not be exposed to them while performing work in the hood. Fume hood controllers which control the flow of air 
through such enclosures have become more sophisticated in 
recent years, and are now able to more accurately 
maintain the desired flow characteristics to efficiently 
exhaust the fumes from an enclosure as a function of the 
desired average face velocity of the opening of the fume 
hood. The average face velocity is generally defined as 
the flow of air into the fume hood per unit of area of 
open face area of the fume hood, with the size of the 
open face area being dependent upon the position of one 
or more moveable doors that are provided on the front of 
the enclosure or fume hood, and in most types of 
enclosures, the amount of bypass opening that is provided 
when the door or doors are closed. Such a fume hood is exhausted by an exhaust system 
that includes a blower that is capable of being driven at 
variable speeds to increase or decrease the flow of air 
from the fume hood to compensate for the varying size of 
the opening. Alternatively, there may be a single blower 
connected to an exhaust manifold that is in turn 
connected to the individual ducts of multiple fume hoods, 
and dampers may be provided in the individual ducts to  
 
control the flow from the individual ducts to thereby 
modulate the flow to maintain the desired average face 
velocity. The doors of such fume hoods can be opened by 
raising them vertically, often referred to as the sash 
position, or some fume hoods have a number of doors that 
are mounted for sliding movement in typically two sets of 
vertical tracks. There are even doors that can be moved 
horizontally and vertically, with the tracks being 
mounted in a frame assembly that is vertically moveable. Very recent improvements in controlling the 
operation of fume hoods have been made and are disclosed 
in the
