<ABSTRACT>
A cord fastening device comprises upper and 
lower body members (10, 12) integrally joined together 

by a support post (14). The upper body member (10) has 
a lower operating portion (18) opposite to the support 

post (14) and confronting the lower body member (12) 
in a horizontal plane via a connecting portion (16) 

integrally extending from the upper body member (10), 
while the lower body member (12) has an upper operating 

portion (22) situated opposite to the support post (14) 
and confronting the upper body member (10) in a horizontal 

plane via another connecting portion (20) integrally 
extending from the lower body member (12). The upper and 

lower body members (10, 12) have on their inside surfaces 
retaining claws (26, 28, 30) for retaining a cord (40) 

inserted through the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cord fastening
device for retaining in a desired position a cord
attached to a garment, a bag or the like and inserted
through the device.A conventional cord fastening device in the form
of a unitary body comprises, as disclosed in, for
example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication
No. SHO 61-105023, a set of mutually complementary T-shape
and C-shape body members which have respective through
holes and are integral with resilient arm and bridge
portions. The T-shape and C-shape body members are
resiliently spaced apart from each other so that the cord
inserted through the through holes is bent between the
through holes and is hence retained therebetween.In the above-mentioned conventional art, since
the cord retaining force corresponds to the frictional
force of the bent cord with respect to the through holes
due to the spreading force of the arm and bridge portions,
the retaining force is weak and the arm tends
to be broken in use. With the foregoing prior art problems in view,
it is an object of this invention to provide a cord
fastening device which facilitates insertion of a cord
and can retain the cord reliably.According to this invention, there is provided a
cord fastening device comprising:
(a) upper and lower body members integrally joined
together by a support post;(b) a first operating portion situated opposite to said
support post and confronting said lower body member in a
common plane when the first operating portion is not operated
via a connecting portion integrally extending
from said upper body member;(c) a second operating portion situated opposite to said
support post and confronting said upper body member in a
common plane when the second operating portion is not operated
via another connecting portion integrally
extending from said lower body member the operating portions
being gripped to come into contact with each other as the
upper and lower body members are resiliently deformed
outwardly along with the support post bridging between the two
body members ; and(d) said upper and lower body members having on
their inside surfaces retaining claws for retaining a cord
when the cord is inserted through said device.The first and second operating portions can be, respectively, lower
and upper ones.Further, the upper
and lower body members and the upper and lower operating
portions are located in rotation symmetry with respect
to the axis extending in a direction in which the cord
is to be inserted. The retaining claw of one of the upper
and lower body

<CLAIMS>
A cord fastening device comprising :

(a) upper and lower body members (10, 12) integrally joined
together by a support post (14);
(b) a first operating portion (18) situated opposite to said
support post (14) and confronting said lower body member (12) in a

common plane when the first operating portion (18) is not operated via
a connecting portion (16) integrally extending from said upper body

member (10);
(c) a second operating portion (22) situated opposite to said
support post (14) and confronting said upper body member (10) in a

common plane when the second operating portion (22) is not operated
via another connecting portion (20) integrally extending from said

lower body member (12), the operating portions (22, 18) being gripped
to come into contact with each other as the upper and lower body

members (10, 12) are resiliently deformed outwardly along with the
support post (14) bridging between the two body members (10, 12);

and
(d) said upper and lower body members (10, 12) having on
their inside surfaces retaining claws (26, 28, 30) for retaining a cord

(40) when the cord is inserted through said device.
A cord fastening device according to claim 1, characterized
in that said first and second operating portions are, respectively, lower

and upper ones.
A cord fastening device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that said upper and lower body members (10, 12) and

said first and second operating portions (18, 22) are located in
rotation symmetry with respect to the axis extending in a direction in

which the cord is to be inserted.
A cord fastening device according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that said retaining claw (28, 30) of one of said upper

and lower body members (10, 12) has a cord receiving recess (42) for
receiving the cord (40), whereby the cord (40) may be held jointly by

an end surface of said retaining claw (26) and said cord receiving

recess (42).
