<ABSTRACT>
A control cable fixing device with an actuating jacket is provided at at least one end with a connecting part which is inserted in a radially and axially immovable manner in the opening of a holding device, the opening having an essentially U shape with U legs. To ensure that the fixing device has a simple structure and can also be inserted without difficulties into the holding device at poorly accessible points, the U legs (22, 23) have a spacing such that the connecting part (5) can be inserted radially into the opening (21), and the connecting part (5) and the U legs (22, 23) have, in the inserted condition, latching elements (18, 19, 26, 27) which grip one behind the other for the radial fixing of the connecting part (5).
