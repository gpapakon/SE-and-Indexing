<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a grate plate construction for a grate plate cooler for cooling hot material such as, for example, cement clinker, which grate plate construction has at its top side hollows for receiving and retaining cooling material for the purpose of protecting the grate plate from thermal overstress, in which case these hollows are to be supplied with cooling air via cooling-air passages arranged in between and via air-outlet slots without the risk of them becoming clogged, a grate plate is proposed according to the invention in which several cooling-air passages (3) extending up to the top side (17) of the grate plate and delimiting the hollows (5) from one another are arranged in the grate plate body (1) parallel to the longitudinal axis (18) of the grate plate, and in which the dividing walls between the air passages (3) and the hollows (5) have air-outlet slots (4) which run parallel to the longitudinal axis (18) of the plate and are arranged directly above the baseplate (2) of the grate plate.

A grate plate for grate plate coolers for the cooling of
hot material, having upwardly-open troughs (5) arranged on

the upper side of the grate plates, wherein a multiplicity
of the grate plates through which cooling air flows is

alternately arranged on fixed-position grate plate
supports (8) and on grate plate supports (8) which move to

and fro in the direction of transport of the grate,
wherein a plurality of cooling air channels (3) separating

the troughs (5) from each other are arranged in the grate
plate body (1) parallel to the grate plate longitudinal

axis (18) and extending to the upper side of the grate
plates (17), and wherein the partition walls between the

air channels (3) are provided with air exit slits (4)
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the plates (18),


characterised in that
 the grate plate body (1) of the
grate plate is provided with a base plate (2) which forms

the base of the cooling material troughs (5) and which
closes the cooling air channels (3) from below, and that

the air exit slits (4) are arranged immediately above the
base plate (2) i.e. are bounded by the base plate (2) and

the undersides of the partition walls.
A grate plate according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the partition walls separating the air channels (3) from
the troughs (5) are bent (6) in the region of the air exit

slits (4) downwardly towards the centre of the troughs
(5).
A grate plate according to either claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the air channels (3) arranged
parallel to the plate longitudinal axis (18) are connected

via supply apertures (14) through a partition wall (13)
with an anterior cooling channel (12) arranged

transversely to the longitudinal axis of the plate behind
the anterior plate front face (11) viewed in the grate

conveying direction, with the base plate (2) being
provided with exit apertures (15) for the discharge of 

cooling air in the region of the cooling channel (12).
A grate plate according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

the supply apertures (14) join flush with the upper inner
surface of the air channels (3) and that the dimensions of

the supply apertures (14) correspond in width to the air
channels (3) and are approximately 30% of their height.
A grate plate according to either claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 projecting strips in the form of
cooling air guiding means (7) are arranged on the base

plate (2) sealing the grate plate body (1) from beneath in
the middle of the troughs (5) parallel to the air exit

slits (4) or plate longitudinal axis (18).
A grate plate according to either claim 1 or 5,

characterised in that
 the base plate (2), which seals from
below the part of the grate plate body (1) projecting from

the grate plate support (8), is fixed to the plate body
(1), e.g., is screwed or welded to it.
