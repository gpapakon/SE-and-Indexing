<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to active acoustic control
systems.The invention arose during continuing development
efforts relating to the subject matter shown and
described in U.S. Patents, 4,677,676, 4,677,677,
4,736,431, 4,815,139, 4,837,834, 4,987,598, 5,022,082,
5,033,082, 5,172,416 and allowed U.S. application Serial
Nos. 07/691,557, 07/794,115, 07/835,721, these
applications corresponding respectively to EP-A-0510864,
EP-A-0542457 and EP-A-0555585.These patents and applications relate to
active acoustic attenuation systems. Active acoustic
attenuation for sound or vibration cancellation or
reduction involves injecting a canceling acoustic wave
to destructively interfere with and cancel or reduce an
input acoustic wave. In an active acoustic attenuation
system the output acoustic wave is sensed with an error
transducer such as a microphone or accelerometer which
transducer such as a microphone or accelerometer which
supplies an error signal to an adaptive filter model
which in turn supplies a correction signal to a
canceling transducer such as a loudspeaker or shaker
which injects an acoustic wave to destructively
interfere with and cancel or reduce the input acoustic
wave.The present invention provides an active acoustic
system as set out in claim 1.A model reference is provides having a selectably
programmable response. For example, in a vibration
control system providing force and/or motion isolation,
a certain damping response characteristic may be desired
such as over-damped, under-damped, quick response, slow
stable response with no overshoot, etc. A model
reference is selected or programmed to have such
response. An active model is then provided, including
in combination an acoustic path and an adaptive filter
such that the combination of the acoustic path and the
adaptive filter adaptively models the model reference
such that the 
combined response of the acoustic path and the
adaptive filter provide an active model response
matching the response of the model reference. The
acoustic path may be a sound duct, a vibration table,
a frame, cab, seats, engine or interior of a vehicle,
or other complex structures or environments for sound
or vibration propagation where it is desired to
provide a selectably programmable response of an
acoustic wave propagating along an acoustic path to
provide a controlled response.In a further embodiment, the invention
additionally provides active acoustic attenuation. A
controlled adaptive response to the input acoustic
wave is provided, matching the response of the
sel
