<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a tamper-evident tape for applying over the flap or other opening in 
cellulosic substrates such as paper products, corrugated containers, cardboard boxes, 

shipping cartons and the like, which tape will provide evidence of tampering with its 
contents over a wide temperature range from above to below the Tg of the adhesive layer 

adhering the tape to the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Our EP-0491 099 A1 discloses a tamper-evident tape for
application over the flap or other opening in pouches,
bags, envelopes and the like, which tape will provide
evidence of tampering over a wide temperature range from
above to below the Tg of the adhesive layer adhering the
tape to the substrate to be protected from tampering.As is described and claimed therein, the tamper-evident
adhesive tape comprises a transparent backing layer
carrying on one side thereof, in order:
(1) a discontinuous layer of deposits of a transparent
barrier material bonded to the backing;(2) a coloured layer bonded to the backing layer in
areas where there are no barrier material deposits, the
barrier material preventing bonding of the coloured layer
to the backing layer in areas where the barrier material
is present; and(3) an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive layer for
securing the tape to the container where any evidence of
tampering is desired, the bond strength between the
backing layer and coloured layer being greater than the
adhesion strength between the coloured layer and the
adhesive layer securing the tape to the container both
above and below the Tg of the adhesive layer, whereby
when attempt is made to remove the tape from the
container to gain access to its contents, the coloured
layer will remain with the backing in areas where they 
are bonded while in areas where barrier material is
present to prevent bonding, the coloured layer will
adhere to the adhesive layer to provide a coloured
pattern or image evidencing tampering with the container
which is visible to the eye, which evidence remains
visible to the eye when an attempt is made to reapply the
coloured layer and backing to the adhesive layer.A tamper-evident tape embodying the aforementioned
invention and which is manufactured and sold by The
Kendall Company, assignee of the instant invention and of
the aforementioned earlier applications, has achieved
considerable commercial success. However, it has been
found that while the tape is entirely efficacious for use
on plastic substrates, it should not be employed on
substrates whose cohesive strength is smaller than the
adhesion between any of the layers of the tape, e.g.
substrates such as paper products, corrugated containers,
cardboard containers, shipping cartons and other such
cellulosic materials.Accordingly, stated simply, the task of the present
invention can be said to modify the aforementioned
commercially available tamper-evident tape currently
employed with pouches, bags, envelopes or other
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tamper-evident adhesive closure for a cellulosic
substrate of a container comprising a transparent backing layer (12)

carrying, in order:

a discontinuous layer (14) of deposits of a transparent
barrier material bonded to the backing layer inner surface;
a coloured layer (16) bonded securely to the inner
surface of the transparent backing in areas where there

is no barrier material deposits, the barrier material
preventing chemical bonding of the coloured layer to the

backing in areas where the barrier material is present; an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (20) for securing the tape to the substrate ;

   characterised in that at least one surface of the
backing layer is provided with a matte finish, the surface

having the matte finish carrying the said layers (14, 16) and in
that between the coloured layer (16) and the acrylic adhesive

layer (20) (referred to herein as the second acrylic layer)
there is located a first acrylic pressure sensitive

adhesive layer (18), and in that the first acrylic pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer possesses a cohesive strength

weaker than that of the substrate to which the closure is
to be applied, whereby tearing of the substrate will be

precluded at all likely peel rates for removing the
closure from the underlying substrate, the bond strength

between the backing layer and coloured layer being
stronger than the adhesion strength between the coloured

layer and the first adhesive layer; and in that the
adhesion strength of the second adhesive layer to the

substrate is stronger than the adhesion strength of the
coloured layer to the first adhesive layer.
A tamper-evident adhesive closure as claimed in
claim 1 characterised in that the first adhesive layer

comprises a layer of an acrylic pressure-sensitive 
adhesive as a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase

of an effective amount of inert filler articles such as
to provide a brittleness and loss of cohesive strength

and tack weakening the cohesive strength of the first
adhesive layer.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in claim 2
characterised in that the ratio by weight of inert

particles in the discontinuous phase to adhesive in the
continuous phase is from about 5:95 to about 90:10.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in claim 2
characterised in that the ratio by weight of inert

particles in the discontinuous phase to adhesive in the
continuous phase is from about 80:20 to about 85:15.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims characterised in that the chemical

bond between the backing and coloured layer is a covalent
bond obtained by crosslinking the coloured layer to the

backing.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims characterised in that the backing

layer and coloured layer each comprise a layer of
polyester material.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims characterised in that the

discontinuous layer of barrier material comprises a
patternwise deposition of the barrier material.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims characterised in that the barrier 

material comprises silicone.
A tamper-evident closure as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims characterised in that the coloured

layer consists essentially of a colour-providing material
and polyester characterised as being relatively soft and

pliant so that under force of removal it will convulate
or distort so that it cannot layer be overlayed on the

adhesive layer without evidence of its removal being
visibly revealed.
A tamper-evident method for revealing tampering of
a container having a cellulosic substrate defining an

opening for access to insert or to remove an article
within the container, comprising the steps of:


(1) inserting an article through the opening and
into the container; and
(2) thereafter sealing the opening closed by
applying over the opening a tamper-evident closure as

claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
A cellulosic container having an opening for
inserting or removal of an article, an article disposed

within the container, and a tamper-evident closure as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 adhered across the

opening of the container to seal the opening closed.
A cellulosic container as claimed in claim 11
characterised in that the container comprises a paper product,

a corrugated article or a cardboard box.
