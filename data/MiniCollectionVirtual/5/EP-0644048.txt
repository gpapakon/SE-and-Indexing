<CLAIMS>
A rotary printing press

a) with blanket cylinders (2) which form print positions with counter-impression
cylinders (2) or a common counter-impression cylinder (2) wherein the

circumferential register adjustment of the blanket cylinders can be performed
coordinated one to each other and
b) with plate cylinders (3) which are each combined with the blanket cylinders (2) in
pairs to form cylinder groups (10) by a mechanical coupling for driving them,
c) the cylinder groups (10) each being driven during the printing by a separate drive
motor (5) and the counter-impression cylinder (2; 6) for each of the the blanket

cylinders (2) of the said cylinder groups (10) being driven by a different drive motor
(5),
characterized in that
d) in each of the cylinder groups (10) the blanket cylinder (2) is driven by the drive
motor (5) of the cylinder group (10) by means of a toothed belt (11), and power is

taken off from the blanket cylinder (2) to the plate cylinder (3) of the cylinder group
(10).
A rotary printing press according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the common counter-impression
cylinder is a central cylinder (6) of a cylinder unit (20) with a plurality of

cylinder groups (10) which is provided with a separate drive motor (5).
A rotary printing press according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 at least one
inking roller (7) of an inking mechanism or of an inking and damping mechanism, which

is associated with a cylinder group (10), is coupled mechanically to the said cylinder
group (10), or a separate drive motor (5) is provided for driving at least one inking roller

(7) of an inking mechanism of this type.
A rotary printing press according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a toothed belt (15) is
used for the coupling between the drive motor (5) and the driven inking roller (7).
A rotary printing press according to one of the preceding Claims, with a control of the 
position and/or the rotational speed of a cylinder group (10) driven by the drive motor (5)

and having a set-value transmitter (22), an actual-value transmitter (21) and a controller
(23) for the drive motor (5), 
characterized in that
 the actual-value transmitter (21)
detects the position and/or the rotational speed of a cylinder (2, 3) of the cylinder group

(10).
A rotary printing press according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 an actual value
emitted by the actual-value transmitter (21) forms the main command variable for the

controller (23).
A rotary printing press according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 no mechanical
actual-value transmitter is provided for the control, and preferably no mechanical actual-value

transmitter is provided for detecting the position and/or the rotational speed of the
drive motor (5).
A rotary printing press according to one of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 a mechanical
transmitter is provided on the drive motor (5), the output signal of which is used as

an input signal for an emergency shut-down of the drive motor (5).
A rotary printing press according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the
actual-value transmitter (21) of the control is attached to the moment-free end of the shaft

of the blanket cylinder (2) driven by the drive motor (5).
A rotary printing press according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 a
cylinder unit (20) with a plurality of cylinder groups (10) comprises two central cylinders

(6) which are provided with one respective separate drive motor (5).
A rotary printing press according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that

three cylinder groups (10) form a print position.
A rotary printing press according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 one cylinder group
(10) is arranged on one printing side and two cylinder groups (10) are arranged on the

opposite printing side of a web (1).
A rotary printing press according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterized in that
 the blanket
cylinder (2) of the cylinder group (10) arranged on one printing side of a web (1) forms

the counter-impression cylinder for the two blanket cylinders (2) - which can be used
alternately - of the cylinder groups (10) arranged on the opposite printing side of the web 

(1).
A rotary printing press according to one of Claims 11 to 13, 
characterized in that
 the
two cylinder groups (10) horizontally opposite each other are combined to form a

cylinder unit (21), and are mounted as such in a machine frame independently of the third
cylinder group (10).
A rotary printing press according to Claim 14, 
characterized in that
 the cylinder unit
(21) is arranged in a Y-shape or a A-shape with the third cylinder group (10).
