steadily, which comprises steps of (a) applying a coating liquid for forming
the silica-containing film with the low-dielectric constant onto the

semiconductor substrate, (b) heating the thus coated film at 50 to 350°C,
and then (c) curing the thus treated film at 350 to 450°C in an inert-gas

atmosphere containing 500 to 15,000 ppm by volume of oxygen, and also
provides a semiconductor substrate having a silica-containing film formed

by the above method.
The above step (b) for the thermal treatment is preferably conducted at
150 to 350°C for 1 to 3 minutes in an air atmosphere. Also, the above

curing step (c) is preferably conducted by placing the semiconductor
substrate on a hot plate kept at 350 to 450°C.
According to the present invention, a semiconductor substrate coated
with a silica-containing film having characteristics of a low-dielectric

constant of 3 or less, a low moisture adsorptivity and high film strength
without causing any damage to the metal wiring arranged on the substrate,

can be obtained steadily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of steadily forming, on a
semiconductor substrate, a silica-containing film having characteristics of a
low-dielectric constant as low as 3 or less, a low moisture adsorptivity and
high film strength without causing any damage to the metal wiring
arranged on the substrate, and also relates to a semiconductor substrate
coated with a silica-containing film having the above characteristics.In semiconductor devices with a multi-level integrated circuit designed
at a rule of 0.25 micron or less, the metal wiring impedance attributed to
electrostatic induction is increased because of the narrow spacing between
metal wiring layers required for the advanced integration of such
semiconductor devices. Thus, a delay in response speed and an increase in
power consumption become problems to be solved. To cope with this, it is
necessary to minimize the dielectric constant of an interconnect insulating
film disposed between a semiconductor substrate and metal wiring layer
such as an aluminum wiring layer or between metal wiring layers.The interconnect insulating film disposed for the above purposes is
generally formed on a substrate by a vapor phase growth method such as 
CVD method or by an ordinary coating method which uses a conventional
coating liquid.However, it is considered that the dielectric constant of the
silica-containing film produced by the vapor phase growth method such as
CVD method is limited to 3.5 (which is obtainable only in the case of the
fluorine-doped silica-containing film), and that decreasing it to 3 or less is
difficult. On the other hand, the coating film containing polyaryl resin,
fluorinated polyimide resin or fluoro-resin, formed on a substrate by the
CVD method or the ordinary coating method, exhibits the low-dielectric
constant of around 2. However, the coating film containing such a resin
has other types of drawbacks such as insufficient adhesion to the substrate
or resist used for its fine processing, and poor resistance to chemicals and
oxygen plasma.The conventional coating liquid for forming a silica-containing film,
which comprises hydrolyzate of alkoxysilane or halogenated silane and/or a
partial hydrolyzate thereof, gives a coating film with the low-dielectric
constant of around 2.5. However, there is a problem of the coating film
insufficiently adhering to the substrate.The inventors of the present invention have found, after extensive
studies to solve the above problems, that each of the coating liquids
described below gives a
