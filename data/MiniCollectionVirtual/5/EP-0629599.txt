<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for the
preparation of cumene by the alkylation of benzene with
propylene. This procedure is carried out in the
presence of zeolite Beta into which certain quantities
of suitable alkaline, earth-alkaline or metallic
cations have been introduced by means of ion exchange.
Cumene or isopropylbenzene is mainly used for the
production of phenol and acetone. The synthesis method,
which is the most widely used at the moment to obtain
it, is the condensation of benzene with propylene
catalyzed by phosphoric acid on infusorial earth.Although this catalyst is not expensive and causes the
formation of small quantities of polyalkylates as by-products,
it is corrosive and consequently creates
considerable problems relating to the plant; in
addition, during the process, it is necessary to add an
exact dosage of water to the feeding to obtain a high
reactivity of the catalyst which must also remain 
constant for the required time. This catalyst moreover
cannot be regenerated and therefore creates problems
for its disposal.Another synthesis method industrially applied uses a
slurry as condensation catalyst, containing aluminium
trichloride and hydrochloric acid. This process has
problems of disposal and corrosion similar to the
previous method, and in addition the catalyst is
difficult to separate from the mixture of products
which have a lower purity than those obtained using
phosphoric acid as catalyst.To avoid these inconveniences condensation processes
have been proposed using a zeolite as catalyst.The use of ZSM-5-type zeolites is described for example
in US patent 4292457 which discloses that a boralite
with a ZSM-5 type structure is capable of catalyzing
the alkylation of benzene with propylene. This type of
zeolitic system however, perhaps owing to channels
which are too small, only enables the production of
cumene with a rather low selectivity.On the other hand a zeolite with wide pores such as
ZSM-12 has a good selectivity for cumene but a low
activity and it is therefore necessary to operate at
high temperatures. These conditions however also favour
undesirable reactions, such as the cracking of the 
cumene, for example, which can cause a rapid deactivation
of the catalyst.There are also numerous patents which describe, for the
synthesis of cumene, the use of zeolites of the
Faujasite type suitably modified by special treatments
such as stabilization by treatment with vapour and
exchange with rare earth.In particular the most widely used is the Y type
zeolite.
