<ABSTRACT>
A sealing device for location between at least two connected 
together components of a reduced pressure material handling 

system is formed of resilient material and extends, in use, 
between areas of relatively high and low pressure. The device 

has a shape which, in cross-section, includes an enlarged head 
portion (57) integrally connected to a relatively narrow neck 

portion (59). The head portion is positioned, in use, remote 
from the relatively low pressure area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sealing devices and in particular 
to sealing devices for use with material handling systems, 
more particularly pneumatic delivery systems operating at 
reduced pressure. DE-A-2 041 230 discloses such a sealing device. According to the present invention there is provided a sealing 
device according to claim 1. Preferably the device includes, integrally connected to the 
neck portion and remote from the head portion, a relatively 
enlarged shoulder portion. In one embodiment of the present invention, a sealing device 
is for sealing between two connected together components of 
a reduced pressure material handling system and the device is, 
in cross-section, of solid construction having an enlarged 
head portion connected to a relatively narrow neck portion, 
the latter being in turn connected to a somewhat enlarged 
shoulder portion. In a second embodiment in accordance with the present 
invention, a sealing device is for location between three 
connected together components of a reduced pressure material 
handling system, the device in this case including the head 
and neck portions and further including a slot, extending from 
that end of the device remote from the head portion to a 
position within the head portion. This slot will, in use, 
accommodate the edge of one of the three components of the 
material handling system.  
 Preferably in any device in accordance with the present 
invention, the head portion is, when sealing cross-section, 
of circular shape except where it extends into the neck 
portion. In use, the sealing device will be located between 
two flanges of components being connected together, the 
flanges being shaped to accommodate the enlarged head portion 
of the sealing device. The present invention will now be described, by way of 
examples only, and with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a diagramatic representation of a 
reduced pressure material handling system incorporating 
sealing devices in accordance with the present invention; Figure 2 is a further view, mainly in vertical 
section, of a vacuum hopper loading device forming part of the 
system of Figure 1; Figure 2A shows a further vacuum hopper loader for 
use in a system such as that shown in Figure 1; Figure 3 shows a first embodiment of a sealing 
device in accordance with the present invention, shown forming 
part of the loading device of Figure 2; and Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of a sealing 
device in accordance with the present invention, again
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sealing device (55) for location between at least two 
connected together components (9, 13) of a reduced pressure material 

handling system, said device being 

made in one piece and 
formed of resilient material

low pressure, 

characterised in that said 
device has a shape which, in cross-section, 

includes an enlarged head portion (57) integrally 
connected to a relatively narrow neck portion (59), the head 

portion being positioned, in use, remote from the relatively 
low pressure area. 
A device according to Claim 1 in which the device 
includes, integrally connected to the neck portion and remote 

from the head portion, a relatively enlarged shoulder portion (61). 
A sealing device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
which is for location between three connected together 

components (9, 11, 71) of a reduced pressure material handling system, the 
device including a slot, extending from that end of the device 

remote from the head portion to a position within the head 
portion.
