<ABSTRACT>
A telephone response mechanism provides a response to a 
caller and an opportunity for the caller to leave a message. 

The telephone response mechanism is utilized when a 
telephone call arrives with no one to answer it. 
The response is made up of three portions. A first portion 
is automatically generated by a data processing system 

based upon the time of day, e.g. "Good morning". 
A second portion is a recorded message identifying the 
person being called, e.g. "This is John Doe. I am not 

currently available." The third portion is created from 
information obtained from a database on the data processing 

system, such as a calendar database or a personnel 
database. The third portion explains to the caller where 

the user (the person being called) is or when the user 
will return. The third portion is automatically updated 

whenever the user updates the database. A lockout feature 
is provided to deny the telephone response mechanism access 

to selected entries in the database.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to to a method and a system
that automatically provide a response to unanswered telephone
calls, such as with electronic phone mail systems.Electronic phone mail systems provide answering capabilities
for incoming telephone calls. An incoming telephone
call triggers a response mechanism in the electronic
phone mail system that provides a prerecorded response to
the caller and that provides an opportunity for the caller
to leave a message for the phone mail user who is being
called.The prerecorded response typically identifies the
person being called and provides other information to
elicit the caller to leave a message. For example, the
system generated response could say: "Hello. John Doe is
not currently available. Please leave a message after you
hear the tone." Alternatively, the user can record a more
personal message in the user's own voice. For example,
the response could say: "Hello. This is John Doe. I am
not currently available. Please leave a message after you
hear the tone."Frequently, a user desires to provide more information
to a caller. The message recorded by the user can
provide limited information on the whereabouts of the
user, such as: "Hello. This is John Doe. I am in the
office today, but either on the telephone or away from my
desk. Please leave a message after you hear the tone." Document US-A-4 327 251 describes an automatic telephone directory system which provides voice
messages to callers. The user wishing to leave a message
enters his user code number and number representing messages.
Callers obtain the messages over the directory telephone lines
by entering the user code number identifying the user party
which the caller wishes to contact. Then the system transmits
the voice message to the caller. However, with these types of
response providing a caller with information on the user,
effective phone mail use requires the user to update the phone
mail response each day. Updating require the user to dial in a
series of codes or passwords. This process takes several
minutes each day. Many users perceive this as a bother and
provide callers only with identifying information.
Furthermore, prior art telephone response mechanisms do not
inform the caller when the user will be available.Therefore, what is needed is a phone mail response mechanism
that would provide useful information to a caller, and that
would automatically update this information without the user.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
telephone response mechanism that

<CLAIMS>
A method of automatically updating a telephone response
mechanism (11), said telephone response mechanism

providing a response to a caller and an opportunity for
the caller to leave a message, characterised in that it

comprises the steps of :

a) retrieving a first response portion (63);
b) retrieving information from a preselected database on a
data processing system and creating a second response

portion from said information (57); and
c) playing said first response portion and said second
response portion to said caller (69).
The method of claim 1 wherein said step of retrieving a
first response portion further comprises the step of

retrieving a prerecorded message.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said step of retrieving
information from said preselected database further

comprises the step of retrieving said information from a
calendar of a user who is being called, or from a

personnel database.
The method of claims 1 to 3 further comprising the step of
determining if access to said information on said data

base by said telephone response mechanism is authorised and if
authorized, then retrieving said information from said

data base.
The method of claim 1 to 4 further comprising the steps
of: 


a) determining the time of day when said caller calls
(59);
b) creating a third response portion relating to the time
of day (65); and
c) playing said third response portion along with said

first and second response portions (69).
A system (11, 31) for automatically updating a telephone
response mechanism, said telephone response mechanism

providing a response to a caller and an opportunity for
the caller to leave a message, said system characterized

in that it comprises :

a) means (13, 25) for retrieving a first response portion;
b) means (21, 29) for retrieving information from a
preselected database on a data processing system and

creating a second response portion from said information;
and
c) means (11) for playing said first response portion and
said second response portion to said caller.
The system of claim 6 wherein said means for retrieving a
first response portion further comprises means for

retrieving a prerecorded message.
The system of claim 6 or 7 wherein said means for
retrieving information from said preselected database

further comprises means for retrieving said information
from a calendar of a user who is being called, or from a

personnel database (21, 29).
The system of claims 6 to 8 further comprising means (11)
for determining if access to said information on said 

database by said telephone response mechanism is
authorized and if authorized, then for retrieving said

information from said database.
The system of claims 6 to 9 further comprising :

a) means (11) for determining the time of day when said
caller calls;
b) means (11) for creating a third response portion
relating to the time of day; and
c) means (11) for playing said third response portion
along with said first and second response portions.
