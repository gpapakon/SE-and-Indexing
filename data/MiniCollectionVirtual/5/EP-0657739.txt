<ABSTRACT>
An air data system includes a probe body 
defining a probe passageway which has a probe inlet and a 

probe outlet. The probe passageway is heated and couples 
an air pressure from the probe inlet to the probe outlet. 

A sensor has a sensor inlet for receiving the air 
pressure. The sensor provides a sensor output indicative 

of the air pressure. A coupling body has a coupling 
passageway which couples the air pressure from the probe 

outlet to the sensor inlet. The coupling passageway has 
a cooled surface for condensing moisture from air in the 

coupling passageway. The coupling body has a reservoir 
positioned relative to the cooled surface to collect the 

condensed moisture. The reservoir is heated to evaporate 
the condensed moisture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air data
system. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a system for preventing and removing moisture ingested
(from both condensation and liquid ingestion) into an air
data sensor system which is used on, for example, air
vehicles and weather monitoring sites.Air data sensing probes are typically embodied
in sensing systems such as Pitot tubes, Pitot-static
tubes, flush static ports, and multi-functional probes.
The sensing probes typically measure static flow angle or
Pitot pressure. The sensors provide a pneumatic input,
such as air pressure, to a transducer which converts the
pneumatic input to an electrical output indicative of the
pneumatic input. Such probes are typically electrically
heated for de-icing and anti-icing.During ground or flight operations, the
aircraft, and consequently the probe, is subjected to
conditions such as rain, sleet, snow, ice, high pressure
washing sprays, temperature and humidity extremes. During
such operations, moisture can be ingested into the probe.
Thus, moisture ingestion has been a long standing problem
with such probes.Further, during the ascent of an aircraft, an
air pressure differential is created between the interior
of the probe and the exterior air mass. The air pressure
is higher inside the probe until the pressure bleeds off
and equalizes with the exterior air mass. The opposite is
true during descents. The air pressure inside the probe
is lower than the external air mass until equilibrium
occurs. The volume and rate of this "bleeding" in the
system is a function of the total air volume of the 
system, and the rate of climb or descent of the aircraft.
Once moisture is ingested into the system, the bleeding
can force the moisture well into the pneumatic passageways
in the system. If cold temperatures are then encountered,
the moisture freezes thereby blocking the pneumatic
passageways causing erroneous air data readings.Another problem with moisture ingestion has
also been observed. During ground operations, the probe
is typically powered up and heated to remove any
accumulated moisture. Warm air can carry a high amount of
water vapor into the probe. Heating of the air in the
probe increases the water carrying capacity of the air and
may force water vapor upstream and downstream in the
pneumatic lines. Furthermore, meniscuses formed in the
relatively small diameter pneumatic tubes may be
undesirably forced downstream toward the transducer.
Water vapor carried into the system typically condenses at
the cool
