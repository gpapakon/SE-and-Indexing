<ABSTRACT>
An offset printing device with interchangeable (removable) cassette (4), includes a framework (1) and removable cassette (4) comprising a plate cylinder (5) and a blanket roller (6), of parallel transverse axes tangential to one another, and capable of being engaged within the framework of the device so that the plate cylinder (5) is in contact, under pressure, with each inking roller (2) with predetermined inking (e), that is to say a predetermined amount of crushing of the peripheral layer, made of a resilient substance, of the inking roller. This inking is determined by a first support element or inking path (14) associated with each bearing of an inking roller (2) and, on each interchangeable cassette (4), a second support element or inking path (15). In order for the correct inking to be obtained automatically each time a cassette is changed, the second inking path (15) of the cassette (4) is made up of a fixed disc (15) bearing a covering (15b) forming a coating of thickness equal to that of the covering (13) associated with the printing plate (12).

Offset printing apparatus with exchangeable cassette 
(4), comprising a frame (1) on which are rotatably mounted 

one or more inking rollers (2), with peripheral layer 
of supple material, of transverse axes, receiving ink 

and water from respective inking and dampening devices, 
and an exchangeable cassette (4) comprising a plate cylinder 

(5) and a blanket cylinder (6), of parallel transverse 
axes, tangential to one another, and adapted to be engaged 

in the frame of the apparatus so that the plate cylinder 
(5) is in contact, under pressure, with each inking roller 

(2) with a predetermined touch (e), i.e. a predetermined 
crushing of the peripheral layer, of supple material, 

of the inking roller, each plate cylinder (5) comprising 
a cliche plate (12) wound and fixed around a cylindrical 

body (11), with the interposition therebetween of a covering 
(13) of variable thickness, this apparatus comprising, 

on the frame (1) of the apparatus and on each side of 
this frame (1), a first abutment element or touch way 

(14) controlling a partial adjustment of the touch (e), 
associated with each bearing of an inking roller (2), 

this first touch way (14) having a first contact surface 
(14a) of which the distance (a) with respect to the axis 

(3) of the inking roller (2) is adjustable, and, on each 
exchangeable cassette (4) and on each side of this cassette 

(4), a second abutment element or touch way (15) controlling 
another partial adjustment of the touch (e), associated 

with each plate cylinder (5), this second touch way 
(15) presenting a second contact surface (15a) of which 

the distance (b) with respect to the axis of the plate 
cylinder (5) is adjustable, the first and second touch 

ways (14, 15) being arranged so that the first and second 
respective contact surfaces (14a, 15a) come into abutment 

against each other when the cassette (4) is placed in  
 

position of functioning in the frame (1) of the apparatus, 
thus automatically determining the desired touch (e) 

between each inking roller (2) and the plate cylinder 
(5), characterized in that the second touch way (15) 

of the cassette (4) is constituted by a fixed disc (15) 
bearing, on that part of its peripheral surface located 

opposite the first contact surface (14a), a covering 
(15b) forming a coating of thickness equal to that of 

covering (13) associated with the cliche plate (12) and 
presenting, on its outer periphery, the second contact 

surface (15a). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the covering (15b) is coated with a protective element.
