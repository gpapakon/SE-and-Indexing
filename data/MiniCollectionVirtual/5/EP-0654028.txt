<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hitherto unknown 3- and 5-substituted 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole-5-imine 
compounds having biological effects making them suitable for 
treatment of cardiovascular diseases (blood clots) and asthma, a process for the 
preparation thereof and a pharmaceutical preparation containing said compounds. 
Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of said compounds for the preparation 
of medicaments. N.G. Finnegan et al., J. Org. Chem. 30, pages 567-575 (1965) discloses the 
compound 3-cyclohexyl-1,2,3,4-oxatriazole-5-imino-hydrochloride. However, no 
biological effect of said compound is mentioned. K. Masuda et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 19 (3) pages 559-563 (1971) discloses 3-aryl-1,2,3,4-oxatriazole-5-imine 
compounds and acyl derivatives thereof, wherein 
the aryl group may be monosubstituted by methyl or halogen. Even though these 
compounds were synthesized in the hope of finding new hypotensive agents, no 
biological effects of the compounds are described. C. Christophersen et al., Acta Chemica Scandinavira, 25, pages 625-630 (1971), 
discloses 3-substituted 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole-5-imino compounds, wherein the 3-substituent 
may be propyl or phenyl or cyclohexyl. However, no biological effects 
of said compounds are described.  
 Hanley et al., J.C.S. Perkin Trans I, 736-740 (1979), discloses 3-aryl-1,2,3,4-oxatrizole-5-imine 
compounds, wherein the aryl group may be monosubstituted 
by methyl or halogen. However, no biological effects of the compounds are 
described. The JP Patents Nos. 20904/70 and 21102/70 disclose 3-substituted 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole-5-imine 
salts and acyl derivatives thereof, wherein the 3-substituent 
may be aryl, optionally monosubstituted by chlorine or methyl. The vasodepressor 
activity of said compounds is stated as a biological effect. GB patent specification No. 2 015 878 discloses 3-phenyl-1,2,3,4-oxatriazole-5-imine 
compounds, for which a pesticidal and/or pest ovicidal and/or hebicidal 
activity has been found. US patent specification No. 4,329,355 discloses anhydro-5-imino-1,2,3,4-oxatriazolium 
hydroxides of a structure similar to the structure of the compounds of the 
present invention. However, the compounds known from this patent specification 
are only mentioned as being useful in the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, from J.C.S. Perkin Trans I, 747-751 (1979) compounds of a 
structure similar to the structure of the compounds of the present invention are 
known. However, no biological effects of said compounds have been stated. The present
