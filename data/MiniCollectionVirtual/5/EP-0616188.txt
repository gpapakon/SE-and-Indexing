<ABSTRACT>
An indicating system for an electronic shooting game 
comprises a xenon flash tube (20) which emits a bright 

flash when a hit occurs. In addition, sets of LEDs (15, 
16) are operated in sequence to indicate a hit. Further, 

there is a vibrator having a metal casing and being 
secured to a metal mounting plate of a front body pack 

(10) to provide a reliable and effective indication to the 
player who has been hit. The flash tube (20) is connected 

to an activation circuit which is mounted within a pair of 
casings which provide RFI shielding and the casings, 

circuits and tube form a modular member connectable in the 
body packs (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an indicating system for an 
electronic shooting game of the type played by teams of 
players playing in an arena providing a battlefield 
environment. It is well known that the appeal of such an electronic 
shooting game depends on a large extent on the visual 
effects which are involved and also on the manner in which 
information is communicated to players. It is often 
crucial for players of such games to know how team mates 
are performing, and also indeed opponents so that the 
correct decisions may be made as the game progresses. British Patent Specification No. GB 2200732 (Tomy Kogyo) 
describes an indicating system which comprises a bulb 
mounted on a headpiece, the bulb flashing at various rates 
to indicate the number of times a player has been hit. 
The possible use of a numerical display is also suggested 
in this patent specification. In British Patent 
Specification No. GB-A-2216813 (Haselhurst) there is 
disclosure of use of low-intensity lights which flash 
quickly when a hit occurs. These lights are mounted on 
the shooting game gun and may also be mounted on the 
player's vest. In European Patent Specification No. 
EP-A-231066 (Futuristic Space Toys) light limiting diodes 
(LEDs) are described to provide indications of hits. 
There is also a mention of a small light bulb which can be 
flashed wherein the duration of flashing is related to the 
score. These lights are mounted on a gun. A problem with such indicating systems is that it is often 
difficult for players to determine very quickly if a hit 
has been recorded. This is particularly true where the 
arena has physical barriers which may block light signals.  It is an object of the invention to provide an indicating 
system which improves communication of hits which have 
occurred both to the player who has been hit and also to 
other players, even if they are at some distance in the 
arena. Another object of the invention to provide an indicating 
system for an electronic shooting game which provides an 
improved visual effect for excitement of the game, 
particularly for younger players. A still further object of the invention is to provide an 
indicating system which is reliable in operation and which 
is inexpensive to produce. According to the invention, there is provided an 
indicating system for an electronic shooting game 
comprising a shooting game hit condition sensor connected 
to a light source, characterised in that the light source 
is a flash tube and is connected to the condition sensor 
by
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An indicating system for an electronic shooting 
game comprising a shooting game hit condition 

sensor connected to a light source, characterised 
in that the light source is a flash tube (20) and 

is connected to the condition sensor (50) by an 
activation circuit (21). 
An indicating system as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the activation circuit and the flash tube 

together form a modular unit (24) connectable to 
a shooting game apparatus. 
An indicating system as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the unit is connectable in a body armour 

circuit (10). 
An indicating system as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the activation circuit (21) is 

mounted in a pair of plastics casings (22,23), one 
(22) of which is coated in an RFI shielding 

coating. 
An indicating system as claimed in claim 3, 
further comprising a metal foil disposed between 

the two casings for additional RFI shielding. 
An indicating system as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the indicating system comprises a 

substantially rigid metal mounting plate (30) 
having means for connection to a body armour 

member (2). 
An indicating system as claimed in claim 6, 
further comprising a vibrator (31) connected to 

 
the condition sensor (50) and rigidly secured to 

the mounting plate (30) on an inwardly-directed 
surface thereof. 
An indicating system as claimed in claim 7, 
wherein the vibrator (31) housing (34) comprises 

an outwardly-directed flange (35) for securing to 
the mounting plate (30). 
An indicating system as claimed in any preceding 
claim further comprising a vibrator connected to 

the condition sensor and comprising means for 
mounting in a shooting game gun. 
An indicating system as claimed in any preceding 
claim, further comprising a plurality of sets of 

lights (15,16) mounted on both front and rear 
sections of a body armour and being connected to 

the condition sensor. 
A vibrator assembly for a body armour of an 
electronic shooting game, the vibrator assembly 

comprising:- 
   at least one motor (32) having an output 

shaft with an off-centre weight; 
   a metal casing (34) housing the motor; and 

   an integral flange (35) in the metal casing 
comprising means for connection to a mounting 

plate (30) of a body pack. 
A game apparatus comprising:-
 

   a set of body armours (1), each incorporating 
an indicating system as claimed in any 

preceding claim; and 
   a shooting game gun associated with each item 

of body armour.
