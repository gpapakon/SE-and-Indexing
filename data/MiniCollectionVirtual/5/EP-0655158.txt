<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for attenuating an unwanted signal, e.g. a speech signal, in a mix of signals, e.g. a broadcast audio signal, includes an adaptive cancellation circuit (30) having an adaptive transversal filter (32) controlled in accordance with the circuit output. The apparatus is provided with a delay measurement system (10) for measuring the delay between the unwanted and mixed signals and for controlling the appropriate one of the two variable delays (21, 22) so as to approximately co-time the unwanted signal and the contribution of the unwanted signal which is in the mixed signal. The adaptive filter can thus be made significantly smaller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
attenuating an unwanted audio signal which is included in a mixed audio signal
which comprises a contribution from the unwanted signal together
with other signals.This invention is particularly applicable to the fields of
broadcasting and programme production, specifically to a method of
removing an unwanted, given, audio component from a mix of signals,
where the amplitude and time-offset of the given component in the
mix are unknown and subject to variation.It is common practice to supply a commentator at an outside
broadcast event with a feed of the off-air programme to provide a
cue signal. An announcer or studio presenter usually leads up to
the contribution and introduces the commentator as part of the
broadcast programme. The commentator hears this cue in the programme
received off-air and starts to speak. A problem which then manifests
itself is that the commentator hears his or her own voice in the
off-air feed with the delay incurred by passing through the
broadcast chain. This has been known to be so distracting as to
render the commentator speechless.This phenomenon currently causes problems in television (TV)
and radio operations. However when Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)
is introduced the delays introduced in the broadcast chain could be
of the order of 500 ms (half a second), and this will cause an
extremely distracting effect even for an experienced commentator.A solution to the problem would be to provide the
commentator with a feed of the programme signal prior to the
addition of his own commentary, i.e. produced locally at the outside
broadcast site. For many operational reasons this is not feasible, 
particularly when the programme has contributions from several
sites, which the commentator would then not be able to hear.The preferred solution to the problem would be to suppress
the sound of the commentator in his personal feed of the programme
which has been received off-air. As the commentary signal is
available on its own at the originating site it can in principle be
subtracted from the off-air feed, if it can be delayed by an
appropriate amount and the correct gain applied to it to give
cancellation in the off-air feed. In addition equalisation may have
been applied to the commentary, either deliberately or as a
consequence of being broadcast, and compensation may also have to be
made for this.Other instances may occur where it would be desirable to
remove a component of a mix of signals, e.g. a mix of dialogue and
sound

A method of attenuating that part of an unwanted
audio signal which is included in a mixed audio signal,

comprising the steps of:

receiving an unwanted audio signal;
receiving a mixed audio signal which contains the
