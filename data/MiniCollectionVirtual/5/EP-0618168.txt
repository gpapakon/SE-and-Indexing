<ABSTRACT>
A capping machine for capping a container (10) having 
a screw-threaded neck portion with a correspondingly 

screw-threaded cap (40). The machine comprises retaining 
means (12) for retaining such a container in a retaining 

position, a rotary chuck (18) for holding such a cap (40) 
above the capping position and linear motion means 

(32,34,35) coupled to the chuck (18) to move the chuck (18) 
both downwardly and upwardly. Forward and reverse rotary 

drive means (20) are coupled to the chuck (18) for rotating 
such a cap (40) in both a clockwise sense and an 

anticlockwise sense. Rotary movement monitoring means (26) 
are constructed and positioned to monitor rotation of the 

chuck (18) and screwthread-disengagement monitoring means 
(36) are arranged to monitor when the screwthreads of such 

a cap (40) and neck disengage momentarily as the cap (40) 
is rotated in the unscrewing sense on the neck and the 

linear motion means (32,34,35) urge the chuck (18) 
downwardly. Control means (28) are connected to the rotary 

drive means (20), the rotary movement monitoring means 
(26), and the screwthread-disengagement monitoring means 

(36), and are such as to rotate the cap (40) in the 
unscrewing sense, monitor the relative angular position of 

the cap (40) when the screwthreads of the cap (40) and the 
neck momentarily disengage, by means of the 

screwthread-disengagement monitoring means (36), and then 
to rotate the cap (40) in the screwing sense by a 

predetermined amount dependent upon the length of the 
screwthreads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capping 
machine for screwing screw-threaded caps on containers. In previously proposed capping machines, screw-threaded 
caps are screwed onto bottles or other containers 
by such capping machines using indirectly powered vertical 
shafts with cap holding chucks mounted at the lower ends of 
these shafts. In each case the shaft is rotated in the 
cap-tightening sense, and the shaft is lowered onto the 
container to be capped whereupon the cap engages the 
container thread and is tightened. In an endeavour to 
obviate over-tightening of the screw-threaded caps a 
slipping clutch arrangement is normally provided in the 
chuck, or by stalling of the motor when the cap is tight. Such machines have the following disadvantages: 
1) high chuck angular velocities are required to 
allow a high throughput of capped containers by the 
machine, but high chuck angular velocities cause the stored 
energy of the rotating mass to produce over-tightened caps 
in spite of the slipping clutch arrangement or motor 
stalling characteristics; 2) low chuck angular velocities are required to 
prevent the inertial effects producing overtorque in the 
capping operation, but such low angular velocities prevent 
a high machine throughput;  3) there is no provision for checking that the cap 
is engaged and properly tightened; 4) such tightening control means, whether they be 
simple friction or magnetic devices, or the construction of 
motor that gives rise to desired stall characteristics, 
results in arbitrary calibration. Furthermore, in the case 
of slipping clutches, there tends to be a calibration drift 
owing to the lack of real time calibration; 5) there is no method of measuring actual torque, 
directly from the torque applying parts of the machine, 
that takes account of inertial forces applied to the cap 
during the capping operation; 6) there is no method of monitoring the quality 
achieved in capping operations, such as checking for 
damaged or crossed threads, broken caps, or presence of 
foreign material in the thread region; and 7) changing the capping head to take different cap 
sizes involves mechanical adjustments with the attendant 
problems of inaccuracy, and it is not normally practical to 
change the machine speed to allow for different cap 
characteristics. It is an aim of the present invention to provide 
a capping machine which obviates one or more of these 
problems. Accordingly the present invention is directed to 
a capping machine for capping a container having a
