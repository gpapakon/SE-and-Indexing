<DESCRIPTION>
It is known to produce nucleotides or polynucleotides 
which are radioactively labeled, such as with isotopes 
or hydrogen (³H), phosphorus (³²P), carbon (¹⁴C) or 
iodine (¹²⁵I). Such radioactively labeled compounds are 
useful to detect, monitor, localize and isolate nucleic 
acids and other molecules of scientific or clinical 
interest. Unfortunately, however, the use of radioactively 
labeled materials presents hazards due to 
radiation. Also due to the relatively short half life 
of the radioactive materials employed to label such 
compounds or materials, the resulting labeled compounds 
or materials have a corresponding relatively short shelf 
life. It has been proposed to chemically label compounds of 
interest, such as nucleotides and polynucleotides, so as 
to overcome or avoid the hazards and difficulties 
associated with such compounds or materials when 
radioactively labeled. In the article by P.R. Langer, 
A. A. Waldrop and D. C. Ward entitled "Enzymatic 
Synthesis of Biotin-Labeled Polynucleotides: Novel 
Nucleic Acid Affinity Probes", in Proc. Natl.Acad.Sci., 
USA, Vol. 78, No. 11, pp. 6633-6637, November, 
1981, there are described analogs of dUTP and UTP that 
contain a biotin molecule bound to the C-5 position of 
the pyrimidine ring through an alkylamine linker arm. 
The biotin-labeled nucleotides are efficient substrates 
for a variety of DNA and RNA polymerases invitro. 
Polynucleotides containing low levels of biotin 
substitution (50 molecules or fewer per kilobase) have 
denaturation, reassociation and hybridization characteristics 
similar to those of unsubstituted controls. 
Biotin-labeled polynucleotides, both single and double  
 
stranded, are selectively and quantatively retained on 
avidin-Sepharose, even after extensive washing with 8M 
urea, 6M guanidine hydrochloride or 99% formamide. In 
addition, biotin-labeled nucleotides can be selectively 
immunoprecipitated in the presence of antibiotin 
antibody and Staphylococcusaurea, Protein A. These 
unique features of biotin-labeled polynucleotides 
suggest that they are useful affinity probes for the 
detection and isolation of specific DNA and RNA 
sequences. The disclosures of this article are herein incorporated 
and made part of this disclosure. The subject matter of 
said article is comprised in EP-A2-0063879 in which 
additionally it is disclosed that 
compounds having the structure: 
wherein B represents a purine, deazapurine, or pyrimidine 
moiety covalently bonded to the C1'-position of the sugar 
moiety, provided
