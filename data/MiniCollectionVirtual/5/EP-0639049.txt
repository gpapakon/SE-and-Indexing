<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of halogenated
4'-methoxyacetophenones, such as
2,2,3'-trihalo-4'-methoxyacetophenones,
as microbicides and preservatives.A large number of commercial, industrial, agricultural
and wood products are subject to microbiological attack which
reduces or destroys their economic value. These products
often contain relatively large amounts of water. Examples of
materials that are subject to degradation are surface
coatings, wood, agricultural seed, leather, fabrics and
plastics (including flexible plastics). Examples of products
sold as aqueous systems which are subject to attack are
latexes, surfactants, dispersants, stabilizers, thickeners,
adhesives, starches, waxes, proteins, emulsifying agents,
detergents, cellulose products, and resins. These aqueous-based
products generally contain organic material and are
formulated in aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions.
Specific aqueous-based products are water-based paints and
metalworking fluids.The temperature at which these products are stored and
their intrinsic characteristics make them susceptible to the
growth of microorganisms. These microorganisms can be
introduced during the manufacturing of a product by exposure
to air, tanks, pipes, equipment, and humans; and/or during
the use of a product from multiple openings and reclosures of
packaged products; or by the introduction of contaminated
objects to stir or remove material.Microbiological degradation of aqueous systems
containing organic materials may manifest itself in a variety
of problems, such as loss of viscosity, gas formation,
objectionable odors, decreased pH, emulsion breaking, color
change, and gelling. This degradation often renders the
system ineffective for its desired use. Another objectionable phenomenon occurring in
industrial process systems involving water is slime
formation. Slime consists of matted deposits of
microorganisms, fibers and debris. It may be stringy,
pasty, rubbery, tapioca-like, or hard; and may have a
characteristic odor that is different from that of the
liquid suspensions in which it is formed. Primarily,
the microorganisms involved in slime formation are
different species of spore-forming and nonspore-forming
bacteria, particularly capsulated forms of bacteria
which secrete gelatinous substances that envelop or
encase the cells. Slime microorganisms also include
filamentous bacteria, filamentous fungi of the mold
type, yeasts, and yeast-like organisms. Slime reduces
yields in industrial processes, such as paper
production
