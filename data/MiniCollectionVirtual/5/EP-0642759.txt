<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for transmittance monitoring in optical instruments having optical waveguide media, in particular in endoscopy devices, having means for detection of the illuminance and conversion into an electrical quantity, and a display device for visualisation of the value of the electrical quantity. In order, in the case of a device of this type, to allow fault location in the entire optical waveguide system together with the light source and eyepiece without ambiguity, rapidly and using simply designed and substantially fail-safe means, it is proposed according to the invention for a photodetector (13) to be provided as the means for detecting the illuminance, which photodetector is arranged in a sleeve (10) which is open on one side, for adaptors (20, 30, 40, 50) to be provided, which adaptors can be plugged onto or into the sleeve (10), and for the dimensions of the sleeve (10) and of the adaptors (20, 30, 40, 50) in the plug-in region to be chosen so as to produce a snug sliding fit, and for the sleeve (10) and adaptors (20, 30, 40, 50) to be provided with defined spacers (11, 31, 41, 51).
