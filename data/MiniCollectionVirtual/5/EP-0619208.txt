<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an anti-lock
brake controlling apparatus.EP-A1-0 363 570 discloses an anti-lock brake controlling
apparatus which includes a master cylinder for feeding an
operation fluid onto the side of a wheel cylinder in
accordance with the actuation of a brake pedal, and a fluid
pressure controlling valve for controlling the fluid pressure
of said wheel cylinder. The anti-lock brake controlling
apparatus uses a sensor which measures the strain of a tire
or the strain around the wheel of a vehicle for determining
the road surface friction. The vehicle anti-lock brake
controlling apparatus is adapted to cyclically increase the
pressure of brake fluid while the road surface frictional
force increases in response to elevation of brake fluid
pressure, decrease the brake fluid pressure when the road
surface frictional force declines despite elevation of brake
fluid pressure, and increase the brake fluid pressure again
when the road surface frictional force has declined in
response to fall-off of brake fluid pressure.An anti-lock brake controlling apparatus is adapted
to detect a sinking quantity of a wheel speed with respect to
a estimated vehicle body speed from the wheel speed, a skid
situation of a wheel from addition and subtraction speed and
so on of the wheel, and prevent locks from being caused
through regulation by correspondingly adding and subtracting
a wheel cylinder fluid pressure, thus shortening a braking
distance, and ensuring stability and steerability.Such anti-lock controlling apparatus
demands that friction coefficients on road surfaces on which
a vehicle runs be correctly grasped so as to effect a more
suitable controlling operation, and a controlling operation
considering it be effected.It is preferable to consider the road surface
friction coefficients to estimate the vehicle body speed,  
because falling and rising speeds of the vehicle body speed,
namely, vehicle body adding and subtracting speeds are
subjected to influences of the road surface friction coefficients.Generation of a lock symptom is also subjected to
influences of the road surface friction coefficients. On the
road surface (high µ road surface) where friction coefficients
are high on the road surface of asphalt or the like, the lock
symptoms are hard to be caused on wheels even if the wheel
cylinder fluid pressure becomes higher. On the road surface
(low µ road surface) where friction coefficients are low on
the road surface such as snow covered road, ice covered road
or the like, lock
