<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pyridine 
derivatives which are useful as a medicament, their 
production and use. Treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis and the like has been carried out by symptomatic 
therapy in which inflammation is relieved by a non-steroidal 
antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). The NSAID's are classified 
into acidic antiinflammatory drugs and basic antiinflammatory 
drugs. On the other hand, recently, more attention has 
been paid to causal therapy in which immunopathy is improved 
by immunomodulatory activity. Examples of drugs used for 
causal therapy include D-penicillamine, levamisole and 
lobenzarit. Most of these NSAID's are acidic antiinflammatory 
drugs represented by aspirin and indomethacin. 
They have disadvantage of causing serious side effects such 
as a stomach ulcer and having difficulty in using them 
continuously for a long period for time. Further, although 
basic antiinflammatory drugs have strong analgesic activity 
they have weak antiinflammatory action and therefore they  
 
are unsuitable for chronic diseases. Furthermore, immunomodulators are insufficient in 
their pharmacological effects, side effects, toxicity and 
the like. Thus, it is desired to develop better drugs which 
are suitable for both symptomatic and causal therapy. Recently, adhesion protein [e.g., intercellular 
adhesion molecule (ICAM)] inhibitors which inhibit 
infiltration of inflammatory cells or block attachment of 
immunocytes which participate in antigen or cell recognition 
have been noted [Masayuki Miyasaka, Jikken-Igaku, 9, 289 
(1991); D.L. Thiele and P.E. Lipsky, Immunology Today, 10, 
375 (1989)]. There are possibilities that these drugs 
inhibit or mitigate inflammatory by a mechanism different 
from conventional one. Therefore, such drugs are expected 
to be antiinflammatory drugs, antiallergic drugs or 
immunosuppressants of new generation. Further EP-A-0 177 907 discloses compounds of the formula 
 
wherein R is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, Z is a phenyl group 
optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms and/or 
a C1-4 alkyl group, R1 and R2 independently are hydrogen, C1-4  
 
alkyl, and C7-11 alkylphenyl group, or 
 
(wherein R is as defined herein before), 
whereby the substituent 
 
is affixed at the 3- or 4-position of the pyridine ring; 
provided that R in not hydrogen if R1 and R2 are methyl and 
Z is 4-chlorophenyl, which compounds are showing gastrocyto-protective 
activity;
