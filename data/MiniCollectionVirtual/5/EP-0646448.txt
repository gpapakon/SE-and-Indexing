<ABSTRACT>
In an injection-moulding machine provided with a deformation element (14) which is articulated on a supporting element (16) for a mould-clamping mechanism (S) for the movement of a movable platen (12) and a stationary platen (11) and which directs the forces and deformations occurring around the mould mounting space (F), a deformation element which is easy to handle and can be adapted to different injection-moulding requirements is provided for an injection-moulding machine by virtue of the fact that the deformation element (14) is in several parts and that the parts of the deformation element which are articulated in the region of the stationary platen (11) and in the region of the supporting element (16) are coupled to one another at at least a first point of connection which is at a distance from the points of articulation.

Injection moulding machine for processing
plasticisable masses having


a positioning element (10),
a stationary mould carrier (11), securely connected
to the positioning elements (10),
a moveable mould carrier (12) which forms a mould
tentering space (F) between itself and the stationary

mould carrier (11),
a closing mechanism (S) to move the moveable mould
carrier (12) onto the stationary mould carrier (11)

and away from it again,
a supporting element (16) for the closing mechanism
(S), said supporting element being mounted moveable

in the closing direction (s-s) on the positioning
element (10),
a multipart deforming element (14, 14') coupled in
the region of the stationary mould carrier (11) and

in the region of the supporting element (16) to
coupling points, and independent of the positioning

element (10), which deforming element substantially
takes up the forces and deformations arising and

guides them around the mould tentering space (F), and
is symmetrical to a vertical plane containing the

closing axis (a-a),

characterised in that, on both sides of the vertical
plane, the pieces of the deforming element, which are 

coupled in the region of the stationary mould carrier
(11) or in the region of the supporting element (16),

are coupled with one another and form with the
stationary mould carrier (11) and supporting element

(16) an actively moveable force frame, in which a drive
device (A) generates a relative movement between pieces

of the deforming element (14, 14') and only acts within
the force frame.
Injection moulding machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that the deforming element on both

sides of the vertical plane comprises respectively at
least three pieces (14c, 14d, 14e), the externally

lying pieces (14c, 14d) being articulated to one
another centrally via a bearing element (44), in that

the externally lying pieces (14c, 14d) are kept
indirectly at a distance, and in that a relative

movement of the pieces may be generated by a drive
device engaging on the bearing element (44).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that the deforming element (14') has a

bracket (53) coupled to the supporting element (16) and
a claw-shaped piece (54) connected thereto and which is

coupled to the stationary mould carrier (11) and
extends from the direction of the stationary mould

carrier (11) beyond a connecting point (connecting pin
50) with an end region (54a), on which a drive device

(A) engaging on the supporting element (16) engages. 
Injection moulding machine according to claim 3,
characterised in that the drive device (A) is linked

via a connection bracket (55) to a stud (56), this
connection bracket being coupled by an eccentric shaft

(57) on the end region (54a) of the claw-shaped piece
(54), which shaft may be actuated by an eccentric drive

(58).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 4,
characterised in that the hinge bolt (51) to couple the

bracket (53) on the supporting element (16), the stud
(56) to couple the connection bracket (55) on the

supporting element (16) and the eccentric shaft (57)
lie in one plane (e-e).
Injection moulding machine according to one of
claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the bracket (53)

for receiving the claw-shaped piece (54) in the region
of the connecting pin (50) is split and that in the

split region (53a) the bracket and claw-shaped piece
(54) are penetrated by a connecting pin (50), and in

that the claw-shaped piece (54) has in the region of
the connecting pin (50) a hump-shaped forming (54b) for

coupling the bracket (53) and which extends almost into
the plane in which lie the axes of the hinge bolts (51,

51) for coupling the bracket (53) on the supporting

element (16) and coupling the claw-shaped piece (54) on
the stationary mould carrier (11). 
Injection moulding machine according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that at the coupling

points, supporting element (16) and stationary mould
carrier (11) have recesses (11a, 16a) into which the

deforming element (14') plunges and may be fixed in
this position by hinge bolts (51, 52), which may be

introduced vertically to the recess (11a, 16a) and
which are supported at the walls (11b) of supporting

element (16) and stationary mould carrier (11).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that joint portions

(hinge bolts 36, 51, 52, joint sockets 37) of joints
