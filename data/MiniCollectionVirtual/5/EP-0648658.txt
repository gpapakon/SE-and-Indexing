<ABSTRACT>
A parking brake system is provided which 
includes a dual solenoid operated valve (20) located in 

series with the emergency brake control valve (18) of 
a hydraulically operated brake system. The dual 

solenoid valve is operable to either one of two 
mechanical detent positions (38) so that positioning 

of the valve is retained in the event of loss of 
power. The dual solenoid valve is controlled by the 

vehicle operator from the transmission console (40) 
and removes fluid pressure from the brakes when 

actuated to a PARK position. An electronic control 
unit (46) is provided for sensing the speed of the 

vehicle and the pressure in the hydraulic line to the 
brakes and provides a PARK enabling signal when the 

vehicle speed is below a predetermined amount. When a 
gear is selected at the console the dual solenoid 

valve is actuated to a position permitting fluid 
pressure to be applied to the brakes and effectively 

returns control of the brakes to the emergency brake 
control device. A pressure sensor (48) is provided in 

the line (16) to the brakes and is used to provide 
feedback to the driver and to control transmission 

shifting.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrically
controlled parking brake systems and more particularly
to such a system including a fault tolerant feature
which permits the system to maintain its present
condition in the event of a loss of electrical power.Braking systems have been proposed wherein
the brakes can be electrically controlled from a
solenoid operated valve connected in series with the
usual "emergency" brake control which mechanically
actuates a valve by pushing or pulling a plunger
located on the vehicle dashboard. The electrically
operated valve may be operated from the transmission
control console, so that a "park" position may be
selected which results in the transmission being
shifted to neutral and the emergency brakes being
applied. The electrically operated valve is usually
spring biased to a position applying the brakes when
the solenoid is deenergized. In order to release the
brakes the solenoid must be energized from the vehicle
battery. One of the problems with such systems is
that an unexpected loss of electrical power results in
de-energization of the electrically operated valve and
application of the brakes which may create a hazardous
condition. In accordance with the present invention, which is defined
in claims 1 and 2, a
parking brake system is provided which includes a dual
solenoid operated valve located in series with the
emergency brake control in an otherwise conventional
hydraulic or pneumatic brake system. The dual opposed
solenoid valve is operable to either one of two
mechanical detent positions so that positioning of the
valve is retained in the event of loss of power. The
dual solenoid valve is controlled by the vehicle
operator from the transmission console and removes
fluid pressure from the brakes when actuated to a PARK
position. An electronic control unit (ECU) is
provided for sensing the speed of the vehicle and the
pressure in the hydraulic line to the brakes and
provides a PARK enabling signal when the vehicle speed
is below a predetermined value. Selection of the PARK
position at the console is effective only in the
presence of a PARK enabling signal from the ECU.
When a gear is selected at the console the dual
solenoid valve is actuated to a position permitting
fluid pressure to be applied to the brakes and
effectively returns control of the brakes to the
emergency brake control device. A pressure sensor is
provided in the line to the brakes and provides an
input to the ECU indicative of whether the brakes are
being applied (low pressure) or are released
