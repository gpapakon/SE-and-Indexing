<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID DIFFϋSERThis invention relates to a diffuser, for example an aerator, for delivering air or another liquid or gaseous fluid in finely divided form to a surrounding medium. More particularly, the invention relates to a fluid diffuser for use in submerged conditions, for example for treating sewage or polluted lakes or waterways with air.It has been previously proposed in PCT application No. GB 91/01092 to provide a tubular diffuser made by perforating a stretched elasro eric membrane or a heat- shrink material which is relaxed or shrunk after perforation so as to reduce the pore size. The tubes are extruded in the required diameter from respective dies which are expensive to manufacture. Subsequent perforation of the_ tube may require a preliminary stretching operation in the case of a tube made of elastomeric material. The alternative heat-shrink material is expensive and requires an additional processing stage after perforation when the tube is heat- shrunk. In either case, perforation of a material tube by needling or laser operation is difficult to achieve satisfactorily at high speeds.The prior diffuser also has the disadvantage that when used in submerged conditions, for example for aerating sewage or polluted waterways, the requisite negative buoyancy aid, which may be a metal filament in the form of a steel cable, can most easily be associated with the tubular diffuser by accommodating it within the bore of the tube thereby occluding a significant proportion of the volume of the tube which would otherwise be available for the passage of fluid. 

 It is an object of the present invention to provide a fluid diffuser for use in submerged conditions, in which the aforesaid disadvantages are obviated or mitigated.According to a first: aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fluid diffuser for use in submerged conditions, comprising a flexible member having opposed walls defining a perforated fluid delivery tube, and a negative buoyancy aid held captive by said walls in spaced relationship with said tube.Said flexible member may be made from a flexible material, for example a heat-sealable synthetic plastics material. Preferred heat-sealable synthetic plastics materials include polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate.Preferably, the perforated fluid delivery tube is arranged to have a circular cross-section when a fluid is flowing therein. Preferably, the perforated fluid delivery tube is arranged to collapse, suitably into a substantially flat state, when a

CLAIMS
1. A fluid diffuser for use in submerged conditions, comprising a flexible member having opposed walls defining a perforated fluid delivery tube, and a negative buoyancy aid held captive by said walls in spaced relationship with said tube.
2. A diffuser according to Claim 1, wherein said flexible member is made from a heat-sealable synthetic plastics material.
3. A diffuser accorαing to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said flexible member is elongate.
4. A diffuser according to any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein said opposed walls of said flexible member are made of the same material.
5. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein each of said opposed walls is of perforate construction.
6. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said opposed walls are made from separate sheets of material.
7. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the perforations are arranged to be self- closing when not subject to internal pressure.
8. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the proximity of the perforations and the elasticity of the tube material are such that 


 internal operating pressures cause asynchronous opening and closing of the perforations.
9. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the perforations taper inwardly towards the centre of the tube.
10. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said negative buoyancy aid is held captive between elongate portions of said flexible member.
11. A diffuser according to Claim 10, wherein said elongate portions are defined by portions of said flexible member which are joined to one another.
12. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the perforated fluid delivery tube and the negative buoyancy aid are movable relative to one another.
13. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said negative buoyancy aid comprises a metal filament.
14. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, further including buoyancy adjustment means for altering the buoyancy of the diffuser.
15. A diffuser according to Claim 14, wherein said buoyancy adjustment means comprises a further, unperforated tube which is inflatable to a variable extent so as to alter the buoyancy of the diffuser. 



16. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, further including tethering means for tethering the diffuser in position.
17. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, the diffuser being of at least 2 metres in length.
18. A diffuser according to any of the preceding claims, the diffuser being sufficiently flexible such that it may be stored in a rolled up state.
19. A fluid diffuser for use in submerged conditions, comprising a perforated fluid delivery tube with tube perforations which are self-closing when not subject to internal pressure, characterised in that the proximity of the perforations and the elasticity of the tube material are such that internal operating pressures cause asynchronous opening and closing of the perforations.
20. A method of diffusing a fluid into a surrounding medium for example air into sewage, the method comprising placing a diffuser according to any of Claims 1 to 19 into said medium and introducing the fluid into the diffuser at a pressure such that the fluid is forced through the perforations of the fluid delivery tube into the surrounding medium.
21. Use of a fluid diffuser according to any of Claims 1 to 19 for diffusing a fluid into a surrounding medium.
22. A method of manufacturing a fluid diffuser according to any of Claims 1 to 18, the method comprising forming a perforated fluid delivery tube using a 


 flexible member and arranging said flexible so as to captivate a negative buoyancy aid in spaced relationship with said tube.
23. A method according to Claim 22, wherein said flexible member is formed from two sheets of material.
24. A method according to Claim 22 or Claim 23, wherein the perforations are formed when the material of the flexible member is in an extended state.
