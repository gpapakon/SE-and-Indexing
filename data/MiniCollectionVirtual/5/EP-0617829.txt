<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electro-optic devices and in particular to 
waveguide array devices and digital optical devices for reading an 
optical disc. Optical waveguides, either active or passive have been fabricated 
from semiconductor, inorganic or organic materials. Optical waveguide switches 
have been reported in telecommunication and sensor applications. Waveguides can be fabricated from a number of different materials, 
most of which may be categorized as crystalline or amorphous. Such materials 
exhibit an electro-optic effect that is broadly defined to include changes in the 
index of refraction, as well as an electro-absorptive effect, which is a change in 
absorption, and both effects are caused by the application of an electric field to a 
material through which light is propagating. A semiconductor waveguide can be 
fabricated by growing successively crystalline layers, for example, successive 
layers of GaAlAs, GaAs, and GaAlAs. Other examples of materials that are 
useful in fabricating waveguides are lithium niobate (LiNbO3), lithium tantalate 
(LiTaO3), zinc oxide (ZnO), and glassy polymers, doped with non-linear optical 
moieties. This ability to alter the index of refraction with an electric field is 
useful for fabricating optical integrated circuit switches, modulators, and 
directional couplers. Single mode waveguides on the order of several wavelengths 
in cross-section are being constructed in electro-optic media making use of the 
technology used to make microelectronic circuits. Laser light is coupled into these 
guides and directed through different types of switching elements that can switch 
as fast as or greater than electrons can be directed through electronic chips. These 
circuits are generally referred to as photonic chips and have considerable potential 
for use in optical recording, telecommunication, computing and imaging graphics.  
 EP-A-338 864 discloses 
an integrated magneto-optical playback head using a discrete light source, a 
waveguide to direct the light onto the optical disc and a second waveguide to guide 
the reflected light for differential detection by photodetectors. An integrated-optic disc pickup device (IODPD) has been proposed 
by Suhara et al., "An integrated optic disc pickup device," 5th IOOC-11th ECOC 
1985, Venezia, Italy, October 1985). The IODPD device was constructed by 
integrating a focussing grating coupler, a grating beam splitter and photodiodes in 
a thin film waveguide on a single substrate. The device is a single channel device 
and

<CLAIMS>
A method for reading an optical disc (67) comprising the 
steps:
 
   launching a light beam from a laser diode (61) onto an array 

of waveguides that are demultiplexed onto a multiplicity 
of data tracks (65), such that the number of data points 

read, simultaneously or sequentially across the width of 
the disc (67) are limited by the rotational speed of the 

optical disc,
 
characterized in that 


the waveguides are serially demultiplexed or addressed in 
parallel, and 
in that the data read from the optical disc (67) are sensed 
with a sensing means. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the array of 
waveguides that are serially demultiplexed onto a multiplicity of data tracks are 

switched by an analog switching means, or by a digital switching means. 
The method according to claim 2, wherein the switching 
means switches the light beam faster than the rotational speed of the optical disc. 
The method according to claim 3, wherein the analog 
switching means is a directional coupler. 
The method according to claim 3, wherein the digital 
switching means is a Y switch or an X switch.
