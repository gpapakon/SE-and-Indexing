<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a high quality epitaxial wafer on 
which the density of microscopic defects in the epitaxial 

layer is reduced to keep the gate oxide integrity thereof 
sufficiently high and to reduce the leakage current at the P-N 

junction thereof when devices are incorporated, thereby improving 

the yield of such devices. In an epitaxial wafer obtained 
by forming an epitaxial layer on a substrate, the density 

of IR laser scatterers is 5 x 10⁵ pieces/cm³ or less 
throughout the epitaxial layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an epitaxial 
wafer and, more particularly, to reduction of micro-defects 
associated with electrical characteristics of 
the wafer such as the gate oxide integrity (GOI) 
thereof. Various devices are incorporated in a surface 
layer of an epitaxial wafer. In order that those 
devices properly electrically operate, the value of GOI 
thereof must be greater than a prescribed value, and a 
leakage current at a P-N junction formed in an epitaxial 
layer must be smaller than a prescribed value. However, 
factors affecting the electrical characteristics of the 
devices as described above have not been fully identified. 
Therefore, not a few such devices are judged to 
be defective because of GOI thereof smaller than the 
prescribed value, or the leakage current at the P-N 
junction thereof greater than the prescribed value. 
This has resulted in a decrease in the yield of such 
devices. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a high quality epitaxial wafer which is able to  
 
keep GOI sufficiently high, to reduce a leakage current 
at the P-N junction thereof when devices are incorporated, 
and to thereby improve the yield of such 
devices. After researches for achieving the above-described 
object, the present inventors have turned 
attention to laser scatterers of a semiconductor wafer 
which produce scattered light when the wafer is 
irradiated by a IR (Infrared) laser on a surface of the 
wafer, and found that GOI of the wafer is deteriorated 
when there are many such IR laser scatterers. It has 
been also revealed that an increase in the number of the 
IR laser scatterers results in an increase in a leakage 
current at a P-N junction. Further, measurement has 
been done on the density of IR laser scatterers in an 
epitaxial wafer obtained by forming an epitaxial layer 
on a semiconductor wafer substrate, and it has been 
revealed that the epitaxial layer grows with succeeding 
a density of IR laser scatterers of the substrate at the 
side of the interface with the substrate, while the 
density goes down with departing from the interface and 
finally goes zero at the surface of the epitaxial layer. 
Thus, it has been revealed that such a profile of the IR 
laser scatterer density in the epitaxial layer causes 
deterioration in the electrical characteristics of 
active regions of devices, which finding led to the 
completion of the present invention. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an epitaxial wafer comprising  
 
a
