<ABSTRACT>
Novel ether lipids were obtained from methanogenic (Methanospirillum hungatei, Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanococcus voltae, Methanosarcina mazei, and Methanobrevibacter smithii), and extremely halophilic (Halobacterium cutirubrum) representatives of the archaeobacteria. Several of the ether lipids produced by Methanospirillum and Methanosarcina genera were purified and characterized structurally for the first time. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared from emulsions of the total polar - ether lipid extracts of such bacteria by pressure extrusion through membranes of various pore sizes. Liposome populations were shown by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy to range in size depending on the pore size of the filter, on the source of the lipids, and on the composition of the suspending buffer medium. In all cases the size ranges indicated highly homogeneous preparations. Leakage of entrapped fluorescent or radioactive compounds established that the ether liposomes were stable to attack by phospholipase A2 and B, and were stable for at least 60 days to storage in an atmosphere of air. The detergent dialysis method of forming liposomes also produced unilamellar liposomes from most of the archaeobacterial total polar lipid extracts which were tested.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polyether lipids, to 
liposomes comprising polyether lipids, and to methods for 
producing such liposomes. Artificial lipid vesicles (liposomes) have become an 
important tool in numerous basic and applied research 
areas. They have been used extensively as biological 
membrane systems for the study of such processes as 
transmembrane transport, lipid bilayer permeability, 
membrane fusion and lipid-protein interaction. They may 
also serve as immunological adjuvants or as carriers of 
drugs and skin care compounds, insecticides, genetic 
material and enzymes. Currently, liposomes are made from ester-lipids, such 
as egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC). The inherent physicochemical 
instability of such liposomes is one of the major 
impediments to their commercial application. Accordingly, 
cholesterol is often included in the liposome composition 
to increase stability, decrease porosity, and prevent their 
fusion or aggregation. Moreover, the ester bonds of these 
liposomes are susceptible to enzymatic and chemical 
hydrolysis, which causes disruption of the liposome 
structure. Ester lipid fatty acyl chains are often 
unsaturated and therefore subject to oxidation in air and 
loss of the structural integrity of liposomes. A 
practically desirable shelf life of two years is normally 
not achieved and special storage conditions may be 
required, such as the removal of oxygen and/or lowered 
temperatures. Archaeobacteria contain very different membrane lipid 
structures than their procaryotic and eucaryotic 
counterparts. Instead of fatty acyl chains, which are  
 
often unsaturated and are esterified to glycerol at carbons 
sn-1,2, archaeobacterial membrane lipids are composed of 
saturated phytanyl chains in ether linkage to glycerol 
carbons with sn-2,3 configuration. In addition to having 
the ubiquitous diether C20,20-lipid various methanogens can 
also have phytanyl chains modified to give rise to 
tetraether, hydroxydiether and macrocyclic diether lipids. 
Variations in the polar head groups are numerous and may 
provide a molecular taxonomic fingerprint for 
identification of each methanogen genus. There are few reports of liposome formation from 
archaeobacterial lipids. Of these, one group reported on 
the formation of large liposomes, i.e. Ring, K. et al 
(1986) In Liposomes as Drug Carriers (Schmidt, K.H., ed), 
p. 101-123, Georg Thieme, Verlag, Stuttgart and New York. 
Specifically, Ring et al produced large vesicles 
(approximated as 600nm) by controlled detergent
