<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic photosensitive member 
having a surface layer comprising a bisphenol Z-type 

polycarbonate resin is charged by contact charging. 
The charged electrophotographic photosensitive member 

is then subjected to imagewise exposure to form an 
electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive 

member, the thus formed electrostatic latent image on 
the electrophotographic photosensitive member is 

developed. The electrophotographic photosensitive 
member shows good resistance to wearing and toner 

sticking when subjected to electrophotographic image 
formation including a contact charging process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic image forming method, an 
electrophotographic apparatus and an electrophotographic 
device unit, respectively, using contact 
charging. In an electrophotographic process including 
steps of charging, exposure, development, transfer and 
cleaning applied to an electrophotographic 
photosensitive member, and a step of fixation to 
images, it has been an ordinary practice to effect 
charging with corona generated by applying a high 
voltage of 5 - 8 kilo-volts DC. In view of ozone and/or NOx generated at the 
time of corona discharge, a contact charging process 
free from generation of such gases has been proposed 
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application (JP-A) 57-178267, 
JP-A 58-40566, etc.). In the contact charging 
process, an electrophotographic photosensitive member 
is charged by a charging member in contact with the 
photosensitive member, and the charging member is 
generally supplied with a DC voltage superposed with 
an AC voltage (JP-A 63-149668). In the contact charging process, the charging  
 
member is in direct contact with an 
electrophotographic photosensitive member, an 
excellent durability is required of the 
electrophotographic photosensitive member. 
Particularly, in case where an AC voltage is applied 
to the charging member, the electrophotographic 
photosensitive member is liable to suffer from 
noticeable surface deterioration, such as occurrence 
of pinholes. The surface deterioration of the 
electrophotographic photosensitive member is liable to 
lead to difficulties, such as toner sticking onto the 
surface or abnormal abrasion of the surface. An object of the present invention is to 
provide an electrophotographic image forming method 
including the use of a photosensitive member capable 
of showing excellent abrasion resistance, causing 
little toner sticking and supplying good images in 
combination with the contact charging process. A further object of the present invention is 
to provide an electrophotographic apparatus and an 
electrophotographic device unit suitable for 
application to such an image forming method. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an electrophotographic image forming method,  
 
comprising:
 
   a contact charging step for charging an 
electrophotographic photosensitive member having a 
surface layer comprising a bisphenol Z-type 
polycarbonate resin by contact charging,
 
   an imagewise exposure step for subjecting the 
charged electrophotographic photosensitive member to
