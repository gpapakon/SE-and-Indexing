<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
(co)polycarbonate composition mainly comprising a 
(co)polycarbonate and a process for preparing thereof. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
discoloration-free, chlorine-free (co)polycarbonate 
composition mainly comprising a heat-resistant, linear 
(co)polycarbonate which is free from any branched 
structure which might be formed by a side reaction 
during polycondensation, and a process for preparing 
thereof, and another (co)polycarbonate composition 
mainly comprising a heat-resistant, branched 
(co)polycarbonate which does not contain chlorine 
causative of discoloration and is suitable for the 
production of a hollow molding, and an efficient 
process for preparing thereof. A high-molecular-weight polycarbonate is a 
general-purpose engineering thermoplastic which is 
useful in various fields, particularly as injection 
molding material or sheet material substituting for  
 
window pane. A polycarbonate is prepared by the interfacial 
polycondensation process (i.e., the phosgene process) 
which comprises adding a solvent such as methylene 
chloride to an aqueous solution or suspension of a 
sodium salt of a dihydric phenol and blowing phosgene 
into the obtained system to conduct a reaction, or by 
the transesterification process which comprises heat-melting 
a dihydric phenol and a carbonic diester such 
as diphenyl carbonate and conducting the 
polycondensation thereof through transesterification 
at high temperature under reduced pressure. Among the above processes, the interfacial 
polycondensation process is generally widely utilized. 
However, according to this process, not only the use 
of highly toxic phosgene is necessitated, but also 
chlorine remains in a reaction product mainly 
comprising a polycarbonate produced. When chlorine 
remains in the reaction product mainly comprising a 
polycarbonate, the reaction product is discolored 
during molding thereof at high temperature. 
Accordingly, the reaction product obtained must be 
washed to lower the residual chlorine concentration. On the other hand, the transesterification 
process has advantages that the use of highly toxic  
 
phosgene is not necessitated and that the provision of 
a step of removing residual chlorine is unnecessary. 
The transesterification process is generally effected 
in the presence of a catalyst at high temperature 
under reduced pressure. As catalysts useful for the 
preparation of a polycarbonate by the 
transesterification process, alkali metal compounds
