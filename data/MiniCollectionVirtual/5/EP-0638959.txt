<ABSTRACT>
A generally elongate female electrical terminal 
(10) includes an improved torsional mating portion (12) 

having a terminal-receiving passageway (34) adapted to 
receive a male terminal (62). The mating portion includes 

two longitudinally spaced generally U-shaped cross 
sectional portions (40, 42) defining the front and rear of 

the passageway. Each U-shaped cross sectional portion is 
defined by a pair of legs (40a, 42a) joined by a bight portion 

(40b, 42b). Two spaced apart side walls extend 
lengthwise of the passageway and connect the legs of the 

cross sectional portions. Each side wall has two 
longitudinally spaced, inwardly projecting dimples (60) for 

engaging the male terminal received in the passageway. A 
bottom wall (64) extends generally perpendicular from one 

of the side walls (44) toward the other side wall (46). A 
free end (64a) of the bottom wall forms a transverse opening 

with the other side wall intermediate the U-shaped 
cross sectional portions. The front and rear of the bottom 

wall are spaced from the cross sectional portions. The 
side walls are flexed outwardly away from each other about 

generally longitudinal axes when a male terminal is 
inserted into the passageway. The bottom wall flexes 

upwardly to bias the male terminal in a more centered 
alignment with the dimples.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a female or
socket-type electrical terminal.A wide variety of mating electrical connectors
employ pairs of interengaging pin and socket terminals for
interconnecting a plurality of circuits or wires through
the mated connectors. The pin and socket terminals often
are called male and female terminals.One type of female terminal includes a generally
rectangular socket or receptacle at its mating end for
receiving a generally rectangular pin or male terminal.
The mating end is formed by an elongate body defining top
and bottom walls and opposite cantilevered side walls. The
terminal conventionally is stamped and formed from sheet
metal material, and the top and bottom walls have open
seams or slits, whereby the opposite side walls can flex
about axes generally perpendicular to the elongated axis of
the terminal. This type of flexing has created some
problems.For instance, it is common to form dimples in the
opposite side walls at the mating end of the female
terminal for establishing a more positive contact with an
inserted male or pin terminal. Preferably, a pair of
longitudinally spaced contacting dimples are formed on each
flexible side wall. Unfortunately, since the side walls
flex about axes which are generally perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the terminal, and since the dimples in 
each pair are spaced longitudinally of the terminal,
when the male terminal is fully inserted there is
unequal pressure applied by the contacting dimples. In
fact, the endmost dimple in each longitudinally spaced
pair often establishes little contacting pressure. This
leads to further complications when the dimples are
plated with a highly conductive material, such as gold.
Uneven wear occurs on the dimples, and the gold plating
actually can wear off of one of the contacting dimples
before the other.A further problem involves centering of the
inserted male terminal which has a tendency to seat in
the bottom of the mating end of the female terminal. Since
the opposite side walls of the split mating end of the female
terminal pivot about axes generally perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the terminal, no provisions can be made
at the mating end to facilitate centering of the male
terminal in the female terminal.Yet, there are attempts to solve the problem on the
basis of a completely different female terminal structure
(GB A 2 225 183) whereby resilient contact arms are provided
that extend into the receiving opening.

<CLAIMS>
A generally elongate female electrical terminal
which includes a torsional mating portion 
(12)
having a terminal-receiving passageway (34) adapted to

receive a male terminal (62), including two longitudinally
spaced generally U-shaped cross sectional portions (40, 42)

defining the front and rear of the passageway, and each U-shaped
cross sectional portion being defined by a pair of

legs (40a, 42a) joined by a bight portion (40b, 42b),
and

   two spaced apart side walls (44, 46) extending
lengthwise of the passageway and connecting the legs (40a,

42a) of the cross sectional portions (40, 42),

   
characterized in that,
 each side wall having inwardly
projecting terminal-contacting means (60) for engaging the male

terminal (62) received in the passageway (34), the distance
between said contacting means being less than the width of

the male terminal; and

   a bottom wall (64) extending generally perpendicular
from one of the side walls (44) toward the other side

wall (46), with a free end (64a) of the bottom wall forming a
transverse opening with the other side wall intermediate the

U-shaped cross sectional portions, the front and rear of the
bottom wall being spaced from the cross sectional portions;

   whereby said side walls (44, 46) are resiliently
flexed outwardly away from each other about generally

longitudinal axes when the male terminal (62) is inserted into
the passageway (34) causing the free end (64a) of said bottom

wall (64) to flex upwardly forcing the male terminal,
inserted into the passageway, upwardly so that the male 

terminal is in more centered alignment with the terminal
contacting means.
A generally elongate female electrical terminal
as set forth in claim 1, including a top wall (48, 50)

extending from one or both of said side walls forming guiding
means to prevent the male terminal (62) from leaving the

passageway (34) from the top thereof.
A generally elongate female electrical terminal
as set forth in claim 1, wherein said inwardly projecting

terminal contacting means (60) on each side wall includes two
longitudinally spaced points of contact.
