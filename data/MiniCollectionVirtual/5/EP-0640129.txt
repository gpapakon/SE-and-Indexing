<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of inhibiting the binding of a cell bearing a cell adhesion protein to a molecule or cell bearing a carbohydrate determinant specific for the cell adhesion molecule. The method involves contacting the cell adhesion protein-bearing cell with an inhibitor molecule bearing the carbohydrate determinant. Also disclosed is a method of inhibiting the binding of the first member of a specific binding pair to the second member of the specific binding pair, involving contacting the first member with an antibody which is specific for the first member and which is covalently bonded to a carbohydrate moiety which interferes with the antibody's ability fo fix complement and bind an Fc receptor. The methods of the invention may be used, for example, to reduce inflammation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITION OF CELL ADHESION PROTEIN- CARBOHYDRATE INTERACTIONSBackground of the Invention This invention relates to therapeutic interference with interactions between cell adhesion proteins and their carbohydrate ligands.ELAM-l is an integral membrane adhesion protein. It possesses an extracellular domain including an N- terminal lectin-related segment, an epidermal growth factor related repeat, and multiple complement regulatory protein motifs (Bevilacqua et al., Science J243..1160, 1989; Stoolman et al., Cell 56.907, 1989). ELAM-l is specifically expressed on the surface of endothelial cells activated by the cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Bevilacqua et al., Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 84.'-9238, 1987), or the peptide hormone Substance P (Matis et al., J. Invest . Dermatol . 9_4:492, 1990). It mediates adhesion of myeloid cells (e.g., neutrophilic granulocytes) to cytokine-activated endothelial cells (Bevilacqua et al., Proc. Natl . Acad . Sci USA 84:9238. 1987) . It has been suggested that ELAM-l is involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immunological events at the interface of the blood and the blood vessel wall (Bevilacqua et al.. Science 243:1160, 1989).Summary of the Invention In general, the invention features a method of inhibiting the binding of a cell bearing a cell adhesion protein to a molecule or cell bearing a carbohydrate determinant specific for the cell adhesion molecule. The method involves contacting the cell adhesion protein- bearing cell with an inhibitor molecule bearing the carbohydrate determinant.In preferred embodiments, the cell adhesion protein is a selectin, such as ELAM-l; the carbohydrate 

 determinant is sialyl-Lex; the sialyl-Lex determinant may be either N-linked or O-linked; the inhibitor molecule contains multiple sialyl-Lex determinants; the inhibitor molecule is a protein, preferably, α^-acid glycoprotein or an antibody, preferably, IgGl; the inhibitor molecule includes one or more of the N-linked glycan addition sites of α^-acid glycoprotein; and the inhibitor molecule is soluble.In a related aspect, the invention features a method of reducing inflammation in a human patient involving administering to .the patient a therapeutically- effective amount of an organic molecule bearing a sialyl- Lex determinant.In preferred embodiments, the organic molecule contains multiple sialyl-Lex determinants; the sialyl- Lex determinant is either N-linked or O-linked; the organic molecule is a protein, preferably, α^-acid glycoprotein or an antibody,
