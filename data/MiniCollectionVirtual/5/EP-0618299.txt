<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to improved methods for 
producing L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine from catechol, pyruvic 

acid and ammonium ion, or catechol and L-serine, by utilizing 
β-tyrosinase activity of a microorganism which belongs to the 

genus 
Erwinia
. According to the method of the present 
invention, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine can be produced at a 

lower cost and higher efficiency as compared with that in the 

conventional method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(hereinafter referred to as L-DOPA).
L-DOPA is widely used as medicine for treating Parkinson
disease.Conventionally, as a method for producing L-DOPA, a
synthetic method which uses vanillin as the starting
material has been widely known. On the other hand, various
methods for producing L-DOPA by utilizing the enzymatic
system of a microorganism have been studied, including that
for producing L-DOPA from catechol, pyruvic acid and ammonium
ion by utilizing β-tyrosinase (Japanese Patent Publication
No. 73-34237; U.S. Patent No. 3,791,924), that from catechol
and L-serine and other amino acids by utilizing β-tyrosinase
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 72-22275; U.S. Patent No.
3,791,924), that from dihydroxycinnamic acid and ammonium
ions by utilizing ammonia-lyase (Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 87-24076), that from L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine by
utilizing oxygenase (Japanese Patent Publication Nos.
72-19033 and 72-14915) and that from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvic
acid by utilizing transaminase
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 83-18475).However, the production of L-DOPA using any of these
methods is expensive, and there has been a need for a method
for producing L-DOPA at low cost and with high efficiency.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method for producing L-DOPA which involves lower production
costs and has higher efficiency compared with conventionally
known methods for producing L-DOPA, by improving the method
for producing L-DOPA which utilizes β-tyrosinase of a
microorganism.As the result of researches to improve a method for
producing L-DOPA which utilizes β-tyrosinase of a
microorganism, the inventors have found that the productivity
of L-DOPA is largely improved by modifying the preparation
method of the culture of the microorganism having β-tyrosinase 
activity, the source of ammonium ion and/or the
way of adding the substrates in the reaction mixture. Based
on the obtained results, the present invention has been
completed.That is, the present invention provides a method for
producing L-DOPA by contacting a culture of a microorganism
belonging to the species Erwiniaherbicola and having β-tyrosinase
activity, cells recovered from the culture, or a product
obtained by processing the recovered cells, with catechol,
pyruvic acid and ammonium ions, or catechol and L-serine,
characterized in that said method utilizes the culture
obtained by further incubating the culture for six to 24
hours after the
