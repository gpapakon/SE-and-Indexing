<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for closing the seam of a rolled up 
bar-shaped dough body (8) being conveyed on a conveyor 

(2), comprising a pair of upstanding conical rolls (52, 
53) located above the conveyor, between which rolls the 

dough body is made to travel, to compress its seam more 
effectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of dough, 
and particularly to an apparatus for reducing the 
tendency for unrolling of a bar-shaped dough body that 
has been produced by rolling up a sheet of dough. More 
specifically, it relates to an apparatus for more 
securely closing the seam of such a rolled up dough 
body. Japanese Utility Model Early-Publication No. 64-52471 
discloses apparatus whose purpose is to prevent 
the unrolling of a rolled up bar-shaped dough body. As 
shown in Figs. 13 and 14 of such publication, the 
apparatus comprises two rotating vertical rolls disposed 
above a conveyor and one rotating horizontal roll above 
the vertical rolls, to define a rectangular passage 
above the conveyor. A rolled up bar of bread dough is 
passed through the passage defined by the rolls, to form 
it into a substantially rectangular shape in cross-section. However, as shown in Fig. 10 of the accompanying 
drawings, as the passage formed by the said rolls has a 
rectangular cross section, only a comparatively weak 
inward force can be applied to the outer edge region of 
the rolled up dough body to cause it to adhere to the 
inwardly adjacent part of the body. Even if such outer 
edge region is pressed against the adjacent part of the 
body at a point near to a corner of the rectangular 
passage, as compared with a straight part thereof, the 
pressing force is still not concentrated enough to cause 
the edge region to securely adhere to the adjacent body 
part. Thus in this known apparatus the pressing force 
is weak, so that the edge tends to become detached from 
its adjacent body part after the body has been shaped. Thus, half-finished bar-shaped dough products, such  
 
as those for French bread, that have been rolled up 
using this known technique, tend to become at least 
partly unrolled, to form spindle-shaped pieces of bread, 
when they are shaped or baked, thus becoming rejects. 
The maximum unrolling effect occurs towards the center 
of the length of a cut dough piece, since both of the 
ends have been compacted by the cutting process and do 
not unroll so readily. Thus a spindle-like form 
results. Consequently, up to now, bread made by rolling 
up a dough sheet cannot be formed with a seam which is 
closed tightly enough to result in a product which is 
reliably free from deformation caused by unrolling. According to the present invention there is 
provided, in apparatus for forming a bar-shaped dough 
body from a dough sheet conveyed on a conveyor, by 
rolling up the sheet from one

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for forming a bar-shaped dough body 
(4) from a dough sheet (1) conveyed on a conveyor (2), 

by rolling up the sheet from one side thereof by means 
of a rolling up device (3), comprising a mechanism for 

closing the seam of the rolled up dough body, characterised 
in that the closing mechanism comprises a pair of 

rotatable conical rolls (52,53) disposed above the said 
conveyor and downstream of the said rolling up device (3), 

with their shafts positioned substantially vertically, 
the rolls (52,53) being arranged to rotate in the downstream 

direction where they face each other, with their conical 
surfaces mutually converging so as to compress the dough 

body (4) as it passes between them. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein each said 
conical roll (52',53') has a plurality of conical 

surfaces with different angles of inclination. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein each 
said conical roll is positioned with its base facing the 

conveyor. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein at least 
one horizontal rotatable roll (54) is mounted above the 

conical rolls and arranged to compress the dough body 
passing between the conical rolls.
