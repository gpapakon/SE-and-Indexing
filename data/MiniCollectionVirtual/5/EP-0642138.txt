<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a flat cable comprising at least two conductors embedded in an insulating sleeve. The insulating sleeve (14) of the flat cable (10) consists of channels (14a, 14b, 14c) each containing one conductor (11, 12, 13) and connected by bridges (15) of smaller cross-section. The edges of the sleeve are equipped with coupling means (16, 17) designed to interact so as to keep the cable (10) in the state of being wound up on itself about its longitudinal axis. The channels (14a, 14b, 14c) of the sleeve (14) each comprise ribs (18) interacting with grooves (19) on rolling up the cable. This cable is advantageous in that it may be easily inserted into a tubular conduit.

A flat cable comprising at least two conductors coated in an insulating sheath, 
which is equipped with coupling means (16, 17) located on its side edges, these 

means being arranged to join said side edges in a removable manner when the latter 
have been previously juxtaposed following winding of the cable (10) on itself around 

its longitudinal axis, the insulating sheath (14) comprising tubular channels (14a, 14b, 
14c) housing the conductors, and flexible linking bridges (15) between the channels, 

characterized in that said channels (14a, 14b, 14c) each comprise a series of 
longitudinal ribs (18) and grooves (19) arranged on one of the faces of the cable (10), 

the ribs being arranged to engage in the corresponding grooves when the cable is 
wound on itself around its longitudinal axis. 
The cable according to claim 1, characterized in that said coupling means 
comprise at least a first element (16) located on one of said side edges of the cable 

and at least a second element (17) located on the other of said side edges of this 
cable, these two elements comprising complementary latching parts (16a, 17a). 
The cable according to claim 2, characterized in that said first element (16) and 
second element (17) and said complementary latching parts (16a, 17a) are 

continuous all the way along the corresponding side edges. 
The cable according to claim 2, characterized in that said coupling means 
comprise a large number of discontinuous first and second elements, regularly 

spaced all the way along the corresponding side edges, each of the first and second 
elements comprising complementary latching parts. 
The cable according to claim 2, characterized in that said first element (16) 
comprises a latching part (16a) having a profile in the shape of a hook and said 

second element (17) comprises a latching part (17a) having a hollow profile, of 
complementary shape to that of the hook. 
The cable according to claim 2, characterized in that said first element comprises a 
latching part formed by at least one protuberance arranged to be fitted in a cavity 

which constitutes the complementary latching part of said second element, these two 
parts achieving a coupling of the pressure button type.  

 
The cable according to claim 2, characterized in that said latching parts are formed 
by surfaces provided with a multitude of hooks and loops arranged to cooperate, in 

order to obtain coupling of said first and second elements. 
The cable according to claim 2, characterized in that said first and second 
elements comprise at least one adhesive substance. 
The cable according to claim 1, characterized in that said channels present a 
smooth surface on the face opposite from the one provided with said ribs and said 

grooves.
