<ABSTRACT>
The roller has an outer printing or coating layer (1) and a series of linked concentric layers (2, 3, 4), at least one of which contains a material conferring thermo-shrink properties. The thermo-shrink layer can be the outer printing or coating layer, over a compressible layer (2) and a supporting layer (3), and it is made from a material based on polyethylene, PVC, polyamide, propylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, or other polymers having a crystalline level of 10 - 60 per cent.

<CLAIMS>
Sleeve for a printing, varnishing or the like machine
cylinder, comprising a plurality of associated

concentrical layers, namely a printing, varnishing or the
like outer layer (1, 10) and one or a plurality of

subjacent layers (2, 3, 20, 30), 
characterized in that
 a
material is integrated with at least one of said layers

(1, 2, 3, 10, 20) for giving thereto a heat shrinkable
character and constituting, in volume, about 10 to 50% of

this layer in order it to keep its function which is
proper thereto and to which is added the thermo-shrinkable

function.
Sleeve according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
thermo-shrinkable layer forms also a printing, varnishing

or the like outer layer (1, 10), a compressible layer (2,
30), a support layer (3) or at least two of these three

layers.
Sleeve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the thermo-shrinkable layer is made of a material
with a base of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride (PVC),

polyamide, polypropylene, fluorinated polyvinylidene
(FPVD), or other polymeric materials having a

cristallinity rate between 10 and 60%.
Sleeve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 it is interrupted according to a
generating line and comprises a clasp (60) for permitting

the mounting thereof on a cylinder (100) before thermoshrinkage. 
Sleeve according to claim 4, 
characterized by
 a
joining (63) of said sleeve on the cylinder (100) at the

level of the clasp (60) for making said sleeve to be
functionnaly endless.
Sleeve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 it forms an offset printing sleeve
or a flexographic printing sleeve.
Sleeve according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
, in
case it forms a flexographic printing sleeve, it

comprises, between a printing photopolymer layer (10) and
a compressible cellular layer (30), a barrier layer (20)

which forms a thermo-shrinkable layer.
Method for positioning a sleeve according to one of
claims 1 to 7 on a printing machine cylinder,


characterized in that
, after positioning the sleeve on a
lower diameter cylinder, this sleeve is heated on the

cylinder by means of a hot air convection system or a
microwave system for activating the thermo-shrinkable

layer in order to cause the shrinkage and mounting of the
sleeve on the periphery of the cylinder.
