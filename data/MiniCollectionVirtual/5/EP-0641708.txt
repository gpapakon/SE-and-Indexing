<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle (1) having a movable cab (3) disposed thereon. The connection 
between cab and vehicle is achieved by a rod structure (11,12). Said rod 

structure at one side is hingedly fixed to the top side (10) of the 
chassis 

and at the other side is hingedly fixed at the position of the rear side (13) 
of the cab. Through this latter fixing, it is possible with a suitable 

design of the rod system to move the cab between a position within the 
confines of the chassis and a position lying outside the front side of 

the chassis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle comprising a cab, 
which is disposed movably thereon at the front side by means of a rod 
structure, at one side connected to the top side of the chassis of the 
vehicle at a distance from the front side thereof, and at the other side 
connected to the cab. Such a vehicle is known from US Patent Specification 3,721,077. 
In this case the rod structure consists of a parallelogram structure, so 
that it is ensured that the cab always remains horizontal during movement 
out of the position on the chassis and out of the position outside the 
chassis. In the case of the device according to this US Patent 
Specification the connection of the rod system to the chassis is formed 
by a column projecting relatively high above the chassis. The connection 
of the rod system to the cab is made at the underside of the cab, which 
means that the cab is moved upwards and forwards out of the position on 
the chassis through movement of the rod system. Such a structure makes it considerably more difficult to get 
into the cab. Moreover, in this way it is not easily possible to use the 
cab as a "balancing weight". For, through movement of the rod system, the 
weight of the cab is moved outwards, but at the same time a movement 
upwards occurs, so that the centre of gravity also shifts upwards, with 
the result that the risk of the device tilting increases. Such movable cabs are used in all kinds of agricultural 
vehicles such as spraying vehicles. In this case the cab is placed on the 
chassis in one position, in which position the vehicle can be driven 
along the road. The actual working on the crop can be carried out in a 
second, displaced position of the cab. In this second, displaced 
position, the driver has a better overall view of the crop ahead of him. 
Although the invention is described here with reference to the movement 
of the cab in the forward direction, it must be understood that if the 
vehicle is moving in another direction, the direction of movement of the 
cab also changes with it, and that such modifications lie within the 
scope of the present invention. It is the object of the present invention to modify the 
structure known from US Patent Specification 3,721,077 in such a way that 
it is easier for the operating person to get into the cab, in the working 
position the cab is closer to the ground, and better balancing of the 
vehicle is provided.  This object is achieved in the case of a vehicle of the type 
described above through the fact that the rod

Vehicle (1) comprising a cab (3), which is disposed movably 
thereon at the front side by means of a rod structure which at one side 

is connected to the top side of the chassis (2) of the vehicle at a 
distance from the front side thereof, and at the other side is hingedly 

connected to the rear side of the cab, which rod structure is movable 
between an essentially vertical position, in which the cab lies within 

the confines of the chassis, and an essentially horizontal position, in 
which the cab lies beyond the front side of the chassis, characterized in 

that the connection between the vehicle and the cab comprises only said 
rod system, in that the vertical position comprises the travelling 

position and the horizontal working position, and in that the rod system 
is fixed to the rear top side of the cab. 
Vehicle according to Claim 1, in which the rod structure 
comprises a parallelogram structure. 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
rod structure is fixed to a scoop-shaped part (9), which scoop-shaped 

part is provided with accommodation means for the cab. 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding claims, in which 
auxiliary means (14) for the vehicle are disposed between the fixing of 

the rod structure and the front side of the chassis.
