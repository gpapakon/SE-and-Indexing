<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural and horticultural fungicidal composition 
comprising a benzothiazole derivative represented by 

formula (I): 

wherein R₁ represents a lower alkyl group, an alkenyl group, 
an alkynyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an alkoxyalkyl group, a 

benzyl group, an alkyl group containing a carbonyl group or 
an alkoxyalkyl group containing a carbonyl group; and R₂ 

represents a lower alkyl group, an alkoxy group or an alkyl 
group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and containing from 1 

to 6 fluorine atoms, and a compound having a fungicidal 
activity is disclosed. The composition exhibits a markedly 

improved effect as compared to the effects of the individual 
use of the ingredient and is useful as the agricultural and 

horticultural fungicidal composition as it exhibits 
preventive and curing effects on plant diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an agricultural or 
horticultural fungicidal composition containing a 
benzothiazole derivative and a conventional fungicidal 
compound. Today application of pesticides in agriculture is 
inevitable for controlling plant diseases to maintain high 
productivity. In the present situation with the great 
problem of environmental pollution confronting us, 
agricultural and horticultural fungicides have been demanded 
to be safe and effective at a dose level as low as possible. Benzothiazole derivatives are compound having 
remarkably high controlling effects on powdery mildew of 
grain, fruit and vegetables as disclosed in JP-A-2-202881 
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means un "unexamined Japanese 
Patent Application) (corresponding to EP-A-0 407 621) and EP-A-0 
568 096. However, continuous application of the same fungicide 
or fungicides having the same mode of action causes 
appearance of resistant microorganisms. It follows that the 
efficacy of the conventional fungicide is reduced, giving 
rise to an increase of diseases or necessity of applying 
large quantities of the fungicides. To solve these problems,  
 
there has been a demand to further increase the fungicidal 
activity and to minimize the dose level of application. In order to solve the above problem, the present 
inventors have extensively investigated plant disease 
controlling effects of a composition comprising the above-mentioned 
benzothiazole derivative and a conventional 
fungicidal compound and, as a result, ascertained that a 
greatly improved effect over that obtained from their 
individual use can be produced, thereby making it possible to 
decrease the effective dose level. The inventors have made a 
further study on combinations of a number of compounds aiming 
at practical use. As a result, the combined use was found 
not only to exhibit sufficient effects at a reduced level but 
also to bring about improvements in preventive effect and 
curing effect. The present invention has been completed 
based on these findings. The present invention provides an agricultural and 
horticultural fungicidal composition comprising a 
benzothiazole derivative represented by formula (I): 
wherein R₁ represents a lower alkyl group, an alkenyl 
group, an alkynyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an 
alkoxyalkyl group, a benzyl group, an alkyl group 
containing a carbonyl group or an alkoxyalkyl group 
containing a carbonyl group; and R₂ represents a 
lower alkyl group, an alkoxy group or an alkyl group 
having from 1 to 3
