<ABSTRACT>
A low temperature process for washing laundry in a domestic washing machine is provided. In this process a detergent composition of bulk density 
>
 650 g/litre is delivered to the wash via a dispensing device. The detergent composition comprises a bleach activator and a coated alkali metal percarbonate bleach wherein the coating material is a mixed salt of an alkali metal carbonate and alkali metal sulphate. The washing process is conducted at a temperature of no more than 50  C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low temperature process for washing laundry
in a domestic washing machine, and more especially to such a process
wherein a high density detergent composition comprising a
carbonate/sulphate coated alkali metal percarbonate salt and a bleach
activator is delivered to the wash via a dispensing device.Considerable interest exists in the development of more 'environmentally
friendly' processes for washing laundry in the home. The term,
'environmentally friendly' as applied to such processes has many
connotations, but will include those wash processes which consume less
energy, principally by operating at lower temperatures, and those which
utilize detergent compositions containing fewer environmentally negative
components. These detergent compositions also preferably are of the so-called,
'compact' type characterised in that they are of higher densities
and contain lower amounts of filler salts than conventional laundry
detergent products.The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely used in laundry detergent
compositions is sodium perborate in the form of either the monohydrate
of tetrahydrate. However, concerns about the impact of boron salts on
the environment have led to an increasing interest in other perhydrate
salts, of which sodium percarbonate is the most readily available.Detergent compositions containing sodium percarbonate are known in the
art. Sodium percarbonate is an attractive perhydrate for use in detergent
compositions because it dissolves readily in water, is weight efficient and, 
after giving up its available oxygen, provides a useful source of carbonate
ions for detergency purposes.The inclusion of percarbonate salts in laundry detergent compositions has
been restricted hitherto by the relative instability of the bleach. In
particular, percarbonate salts decompose rapidly when stored in a moist
and/or warm atmosphere. It is known that acceptable storage
characteristics may however be obtained through the protection of the
carbonate by coating the crystalline product, or by the inclusion of
stabilizing agents during its manufacture, or both. A variety of suitable
coating agents have been proposed including silicates and mixtures of
inorganic sulphate and carbonate salts. For example, WO 92/06163 describes percarbonate coated with silicate.Whilst coating of the percarbonate bleach improves its storage stability
the presence of the coating may act so as to inhibit the performance of the
bleach, particularly when used in low temperature washing processes.

A process for washing laundry in a domestic washing machine in
which a dispensing device containing an effective amount of a granular

laundry detergent composition is introduced into the drum of the washing
machine before the commencement of the wash, wherein said dispensing

device permits progressive release of said granular laundry detergent
composition into the wash liquor during the wash, and wherein said

granular laundry detergent composition has a bulk density greater than
650 g/litre and comprises:

thereof; and
(b) from 5% to 80% by weight of non-phosphate builder salt, and
mixtures thereof.
