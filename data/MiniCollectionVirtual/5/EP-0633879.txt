<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an enantiomer of a known compound, its use as a pharmaceutical,
in particular in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, a process for its
production, and pharmaceutical formulations containing it.A major problem with existing drugs used to treat neurodegenerative disorders is a lack
of predictability in the concentration of a drug in a patient's blood plasma resulting from
administration of a given quantity of that drug, i.e. existing drugs do not exhibit linear
pharmacokinetics. It has been stated that an ideal drug in this field would show a linear
relationship between blood plasma concentration and dose size so that a given change
in dose would yield a predictable change in blood plasma concentration of the drug
['Pharmacokinetics of old, new and yet-to-be discovered antiepileptic drugs', R H Levy
and B M Kerr, Epilepsia, vol 30, Supp 1, S35-S41, 1989].European Patent Application 356035 discloses a large number of compounds for use in
the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine
[referred to therein as 1-phenyl-2-(2-pyridinyl)ethylamine],
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the (S)-enantiomer of this compound exhibits
linear pharmacokinetics, whereas the racemate exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics.Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided (S)-α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine,
 
substantially free from its (R)-enantiomer, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives
thereof (hereinafter referred to together as "the compounds of the invention").By "substantially free from its (R)-enantiomer", is meant that a sample of the (S)-enantiomer
contains less than 10% by weight of the (R)-enantiomer (i.e. it is more than
90% enantiopure), more preferably less than 1% by weight of the (R)-enantiomer, and
most preferably is pure (S)-enantiomer.Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include compounds which are suitable
bioprecursors (prodrugs) of (S)-α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine, and of particular interest
- acid addition salts.Suitable bioprecursors of (+)-α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine include amino acid amide
derivatives of the amino group, in particular α-amino acid derivatives such as glycine
derivatives. Such derivatives may be prepared by conventional methods, for example
amino acid amide derivatives may be prepared by the methods given in 'Advanced
Organic Chemistry' by J March, 2nd edition, published by McGraw-Hill, page 1171.Acid addition salts of (S)-α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine include salts of mineral
