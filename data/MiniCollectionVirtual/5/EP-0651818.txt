<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to immunogenic
polypeptides. Antibodies may be raised to such
polypeptides, and used to prevent binding of gp120 protein
with CD4 receptors.The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-I, also referred
to as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-III/LAV) is the etiological
agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
and related disorders. [Barre-Sinoussi, et al., Science
220:868-871 (1983); Gallo et al. Science224:500-503
(1984); Levy et al., Science225:840-842 (1984); Popovic
et al., Science224:497-500 (1984); Sarngadharan et al.,
Science224:506-508 (1984); Siegal et al., N. Engl. J.
Med.305:1439-1444 (1981)]. This disease is characterized
by a long asymptomatic period followed by the progressive
degeneration of the immune system and the central nervous
system. Studies of the virus indicate that replication is
highly regulated, and both latent and lytic infection of
the CD4 positive helper subset of T-lymphocytes occur in
tissue culture, [Zagury et al., Science231:850-853
(1986)]. The expression of the virus in infected patients
also appears to be regulated as the titer of infectious
virus remains low throughout the course of the disease.
Molecular studies of the replication and genomic
organization of HIV-I show that it encodes a number of
genes [Ratner et al., Nature313:277-284 (1985);
Sanchez-Pescador et al., Science227:484-492 (1985);
Muesing et al., Nature313:450-457 (1985); Wain-Hobson et
al., Cell40:9-17 (1985)]. Three of the genes, the gag,
pol and env genes are common to all retroviruses. The 
genome also encodes additional genes that are not common
to most retrovirus, the tat,rev (formerly referred to as
art), nef, vif, vpr and vpu genes [Sodroski et al.,
Science231:1549-1553 (1986); Arya et al., Science229:69-73 (1985); Sodroski et al., Science227:171-173
(1985); Sodroski et al., Nature321:412-417 (1986);
Feinberg et al., Cell46:807-817 (1986); Haseltine, W.A.,
Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 1:217-240
(1988); Cohen, E. et al., Nature334:532-534 (1988);
Wong-Staal, F., et al., AIDS Res. and Human Retro Viruses
3:33-39 (1987)]Nucleotide sequences from viral genomes of other
retroviruses, particularly HIV-2 and simian
immunodeficiency viruses, SIV (previously referred to as
STLV-III), also contain the structural genes including env
as well as regulatory sequences such as tat,rev and nef
[Guyader et al., Nature326:662-669 (1987); Chakrabarti et
al., Nature328:543-547 (1987)]The env genes of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV all produce an
envelope glycoprotein, which is

<CLAIMS>
An immunogenic peptide which corresponds to a sufficient portion of a gp 120 
env
 protein for HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV to define a conformational discontinuous
epitope approximating native gp120's conformation that will generate an

antibody that will specifically bind to gp120, but wherein exposure of the
epitope is increased as a result of the peptide having at least a portion of one gp120 variable

region and preferably portions of one or more gp120 variable regions deleted
while maintaining the overall 3-dimensional structure of the peptide.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 1, wherein amino acid residues from at least
two conserved regions define the conformational discontinuous epitope.

residue which is a sugar addition site proximal on the three-dimensional

structure of gp 120 to an epitopic element of a conserved discontinuous epitope
is deleted.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 2, wherein amino acid residues
corresponding to the HIV-1 gp 120 
env
 protein amino acid residues 256-257,
368-370, 421, 427, 454, 470-484 define the discontinuous epitope.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 4, wherein a cysteine residue is present in
either the first, second, penultimate ar last position on the peptide.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 5, wherein the cystein residue is present in
the first or penultimate position on the peptide.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 1, wherein the sufficient portion of the gp 120

env
 protein to define a discontinuous epitope comprises HIV-1 amino acid
residues 256-257, 368-370, 421 and 470-484; and wherein the amino acid

residues flanking the discontinuous epitope correspond to a sufficient number
of amino acids to maintain Î²-turn of the gp120 
env
 protein in their proper
conformation to retain an overall conformation approximating that of the native

gp120 
env
 protein.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 7, wherein the peptide corresponds to an
HIV-1 gp 120 protein with at least one variable region removed.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 8, wherein the V1 and V2 regions have been
removed and inserted therefor is a 
gly

An immunogenic peptide of claim 4, wherein said peptide corresponds to an
HIV-1 gp 120 
env
 protein with a mutation in at least one site selected from the
group of HIV-1 gp120 amino acid residues consisting of residues 266, 356, 381,

427, 432, 435, 438, 493, and 495.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 2, wherein single amino acid changes in
gp 120 residues proximal to the linear components of the epitope are made. 
The immunogenic peptide of claim 2, wherein said conformational discontinuous
epitope is defined by amino acids from at least conserved regions C-1, C-2, and

C-3.
The immunogenic peptide of claim 2, wherein said conformational discontinuous
epitope is defined by amino acids from at least conserved regions C-1, C-2, C-3,

A method which comprises using an immunogenic peptide of any preceeding
claim to generate an antibody to the HIV gp 120 g lycoprotein in a host animal

or host cell other than an individual to be treated, and collecting the generated
antibody.
