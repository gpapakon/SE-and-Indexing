<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new pharmaceutical
composition for the treatment of tuberculosis and
leprosy. The new composition has increased
therapeutic efficacy. The invention particularly
relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing
piperine anti-tuberculosis/leprotic drugs.The global problems of combating TB intensified by the
country's economic problem and corresponding lack of
health education which makes spitting a national
pass-time and covering one's mouth, while coughing, a
rare phenomenon.As TB is one of the oldest diseases known to man, it
has also been one of the hardest to conquer. Till
today, it remains one of the six targeted diseases by
WHO's expanded programme on immunization. Central
Bureau of Health lnformation figures show rise in
number of cases from 610,531 in 1977 to 852,334 in
1987. WHO surveys, however, reveal that each year
almost three million people die from TB all over the
world. Four to five million new cases of acute,
highly contagious pulmonary tuberculosis emerge
annually. In addition to this an equal number of less
serious forms appear bringing the world total to 10
million new cases every year.Of this, an estimated two million are children below
the age of five.Though so called wonder drugs are available in the
market for the treatment of Tuberculosis and Leprosy
they are within the reach of only the affluent. Exact 
economic impact is difficult to calculate but above
mentioned facts give a fair idea of the magnitude.
Until short course chemotherapy becomes a norm total
TB control will be slow in coming years. Not only
does it reduce the default risk but it has cure rate
of almost 100% against 70% in long term therapy. The
prohibitive factor is, of course, the cost.
Rifampicin, even in the west, is the costliest of the
TB drugs. Low requirement of rifampicin and other
antituberculosis drugs with enhanced activity combined
with shorts course regimen may be the answer to meet
the situation.The quest for newer drugs, dosage forms or better
formulations is motivated by an overriding requirement
e.g. minimum possible dose in a dosage form that will
provide controlled, reproducible therapeutic amounts
of the drug to the body. The bioavailability is,
therefore, an essential part of the drug formulation
and has come to be increasingly accepted. In other
words it means that performance of the drug in vivo
is the most important factor in order to evaluate its
efficacy.A look into the Indian system of medicine will show
that generally complex formulations are
