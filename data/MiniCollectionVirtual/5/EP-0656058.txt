<ABSTRACT>
Enzyme granulates contain besides the enzyme water-soluble and water-insoluble fillers, binders and if required other additives for granulates. In order to stabilise the enzyme, an alkaline or earth alkaline metal formiate is added, as well as reducing sugar, if required. These enzyme granulates may contain all usual enzymes for washing and cleaning purposes, in particular alkaline proteases. A process for preparing these enzyme granulates, as well as their use in powdery washing product compositions are also disclosed.

<CLAIMS>
Enzyme granules comprising an enzyme or enzyme 
mixture, a water-insoluble filler mixture, water-soluble 

fillers, binders and, if appropriate, other granulating 
auxiliaries, characterized in that they comprise a 

formate of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal and if 
appropriate reducing sugars. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that they comprise calcium formate. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that they comprise reducing 

disaccharides, preferably lactose and/or maltose, as the 
reducing sugars. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that they comprise a protease, amylase, 

cellulase, hemicellulase, lipase or oxidoreductase or 
mixtures thereof as the enzyme. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that they comprise a mixture of cellulose, a 

laminar silicate or laminar silicate mixture and if 
appropriate cereal flour and/or starch as the water-insoluble 

filler mixture. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that they comprise alkali metal chlorides or 

alkali metal acetates or alkali metal sulphates or 
mixtures thereof as the water-soluble fillers. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that they comprise polyethylene glycol having 

molecular weights in the range of 200 to 10,000 and 
polyvinylpyrrolidone having molecular weights in the 

range of 12,000 to 3,000,000 as the binders. 
Enzyme granules according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that they consist of particles having a particle 

size in the range from 0.2 to 1.0 mm. 
Use of enzyme granules according to one of the 
preceding claims in pulverulent detergents and cleaning 

agents. 
Process for the preparation of enzyme granules,  
 

in which an extrudable composition obtained by mixing an 
enzyme concentrate with water, water-soluble and water-insoluble 

fillers, binders and, if appropriate, other 
granulating auxiliaries is extruded to particles, the 

resulting particles are rounded in a rounding apparatus 
and the rounded particles are then dried and, if appropriate, 

coated with a protective coating, characterized 
in that a formate of an alkali metal or alkaline earth 

metal in an amount of 0.5 to 15% by weight and, if 
appropriate, reducing sugars in an amount of 0.5 to 20% 

by weight, based on the total solids content of the 
enzyme granules, are added to the extrudable composition.
