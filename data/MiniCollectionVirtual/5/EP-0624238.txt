<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger having plastic channel plates (10) is manufactured by stacking the plates with intermediate spacer members. The channel plates comprise two outer walls (12, 14) which are interconnected by a plurality of intermediate walls (16). The end-portions of the intermediate walls are melted along a predetermined length thereof, while the end-portions of the outer walls of each channel plate are caused to bend away from one another, such that the edges will form integrated unities with the edges of adjacent end-portions of adjacent channel plates. Prior to solidification of the resultant joins, the joins may be flattened-out with the aid of a roller. According to the invention, the spaces defined by the outer walls of the channel plates and the spacer members may be filled with plastic particles, which form an integrated unity with the end-portions of the channel plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
heat exchangers for counter flow, cross flow or parallel 
flow, wherein the heat exchangers are substansially made up 
of a plurality of extruded plastic channel plates, and a 
heat exchanger produced according to the method. One such method is described in EP-A1-0 315 052. According 
to this known method the channel plates are treated in a 
manner to cause respective end portions of the outer walls 
of the individual channel plates of the heat exchanger to 
bend outwardly, such that the edges of said outwardly bent 
end portions will lie in contact with one another or in the 
vicinity of one another, and are then mutually joined by a 
weld seam, by gluing or by a U-shaped section fitted over 
said edges, so as to close the channels in the transverse 
channel system, formed with the aid of spacer members, at 
the side edges of said channels. The heat exchanger may be 
coupled for parallel current, counter current or cross 
current flow of the heat-exchanging fluids, which may be 
liquids or gases. According to one preferred alternative proposed in the 
aforesaid publication, a part of the end portions of the 
intermediate walls is milled away prior to mutually assembling 
the channel plates together with intermediate 
spacer members, so as to expose a desired length of the end 
portions of the outer walls, these exposed end portions 
then being bent outwards. According to another alternative 
proposed in the aforesaid publication, the intermediate 
walls are configured at the channel-plate manufacturing 
stage such that the height of the end-portions of said 
intermediate walls becomes succesively greater the closer 
to the edge of the channel plates at the same time as the  
 
end portions of the outer walls are given a correspondingly, 
outwardly curved or bent form. This pre-forming of the channel plates involves additional 
work and therewith higher manufacturing costs. Another method of manufacturing a heat exchanger comprising 
plastic channel plates is described in EP-A-226 825. The 
end portions of the channel plates are fitted into openings 
provided in two plastic end plates and are therewith held 
parallel-with one another in given space relationship. The 
channel plates are then heat treated so as to melt the ends 
of the narrow long sides and the broad long sides of said 
plates, causing the channel walls to expand and to fuse to 
the inner defining surfaces of said openings. Alternatively, 
the channel plates may extend slightly

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing heat exchangers for counter 
flow, cross flow or parallel flow, in which a plurality of 

extruded plastic channel plates are mutually stacked together 
with intermediate spacer members so as to form a first 

channel system between the channel plates and to form a 
second channel system consisting of channels in the channel 

plates, said plates having two outer walls which are mutually 
connected by parallel intermediate walls to form the second 

channel system, and in which the end-edges of the outer walls 
forming respective channel walls in the first channel system 

are mutually joined with the aid of heat treatment so as to 
close the channels of the first channel system at the side 

edges of said channels, 
characterized
 in that the end sides 
of the plate pack, in the proximity of the ends of the second 

channel system, are heated with radiation heat or with thermal 
convection heat until a predetermined length of the 

end-portions of the intermediate walls has melted down and 
that the end-portions of adjacent outer walls at the same 

time are caused to bend outwardly away from one another as a 
result of changes, due to the heat treatment, in the stresses 

present in the plastic material, such that the essentially 
semi-liquid end-portions are brought into contact with the 

outwardly curved end-portions of the outer walls of adjacent 
channel plates and melt-fused with said outer walls, and 

after the operation is concluded, the spacer members are 
removed. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
spacer members are heat-absorbing members which are disposed 

in the vicinity of the end-portions of the outer walls prior 
to said heat treatment process. 
A method according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized
 by 
flattening the heat-treated end-portions while said portions 

are in a heated and plastic state, with the aid of a flattening 
device such as a pressure plate or a roll.  

 
A method according to Claim 2 or Claim 3, 
characterized
 in 
that the spacer members consist of strips or plates of 

heat-absorbing material, such as aluminium.
