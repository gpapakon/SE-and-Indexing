<ABSTRACT>
A digital filter capable of reducing the number of 
data read times and reducing output distortions. A 

correlation between input data sampled at a frequency f
s
 
is detected by a correlation detector. The input data is 

written in a memory. First data delayed by [ 

natural 
number m - (tap number Ni - 1)/2 
 
]
 clocks from the input 
data and second data delayed by [ 


natural number m + (tap 
number Ni - 1)/2 + 1 
 
]
 clocks from the input data are read 
from the memory. The second data is multiplied by 0 

during an Ni clock time and by - 1 after the Ni clock 
time by multipliers. The first data and the outputs of 

the multipliers are accumulatively added together by 
accumulative adders. The outputs of the accumulative 

adders are multiplied by 1/Ni by multipliers, and one of 
the outputs is selected as an output of the digital 

filter by a selector in accordance with a correlation 
output detected from input data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital filter,
and more particularly to a digital filter in which an
output of the digital filter is selected from outputs of
a plurality of digital low-pass filters (hereinafter
simply called a low-pass filter) in accordance with a
correlation output detected from input data.In a conventional digital filter such as shown in
Fig.7, an output of the digital filter is selected from
outputs of K low-pass filters disposed in parallel each
having a different number Ni of taps, in accordance with
a correlation output detected from input data.
Specifically, input data is sampled by a pulse having a
frequency of fs and written in a memory in response to a
write clock pulse (hereinafter simply called a clock)
synchronizing with the frequency fs. Ni data delayed by z
+ 1, z + 2,... clocks (z is a natural number including 0)
are read from the memory 1 and added by accumulative
adders 2i whose outputs are divided by respective tap
numbers Ni by multipliers 3i and supplied to a selector 
4. The selector 4 selectes the outputs of the
multipliers 3i in accordance with a correlation of input
data detected by a correlation detector 5.With the conventional digital filter, it is
necessary to read data corresponding in number to at
least the maximum tap number from the memory 1 in a time
period of 1/fs and to add Ni data at the accumulative
adders 2i. An output of the digital filter sequentially
selected by the selector 4 has distortions because each
low-pass filter has a different group delay time.The operation of such a conventional digital filter
will be described in more detail with reference to Fig.8.
This digital filter has two low-pass filters. The clock
frequency is 352.8 (= 8 * 44.1) kHz, the number Ni of
taps of a low-pass filter LPF10 is 15, the number Ni of
taps of a low-pass filter LPF11 is 31, and z is 0.In this example, a memory 1, an accumulative adder
21, and a multiplier 31 constitute the low-pass filter
LPF10 having the tap number Ni = 15, and the memory 1, an
accumulative adder 22, and a multiplier 32 constitute the
low-pass filter LPF11 having the tap number Ni = 31.
Input data is sequentially written in a memory 1 in
response to a clock having the frequency fs = 352.8 kHz.
In parallel with this data write, the accumulative adders
21 and 22 are reset and thereafter, 31 sets of data 
delayed by 0, 1, 2,..., 30 clocks from the input data are
read from the memory 1 in a time period of 1/325.8 kHz =
2.83 Âµs. 15 sets of data delayed by 0, 1, 2,..., 14
clocks are inputted
