<ABSTRACT>
A rotary switch includes a plurality of switching 
terminals (28a-28e) exposed within a chamber in a housing (22). A fixed 

planar contact member, having a plurality of spring contact 
arms (56a,56b,58a,58b), is mounted in the chamber above the terminals. 

Each of 
the contact arms is movable out of the plane of the contact 

member to contact an associated one of the terminals. Each of 
the contact arms includes a cam follower (60a,60b,62a,62b), 

at least two of the 
cam followers being equidistant from the center of the contact 

member. The cam followers are operatively engaged, in a 
predetermined sequence, by camming elements extending axially 

from the bottom surface of a rotor mounted in the chamber above 
the contact member. The equidistant cam followers are engaged 

by camming elements that are spaced from the center of the 
rotor by a distance equal to the distance separating the 

equidistant cam followers from the center of the contact 
member. Thus, at least two contact arms are actuated by 

camming elements sharing a common radius, thereby allowing the 
optimum use of space. The contact member is fixed in the 

chamber by a set of asymmetrical tabs that are received in 
slots in the chamber wall, thereby preventing an inadvertent 

erroneous orientation of the contact member during assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of rotary 
switches. More specifically, it relates to a rotary encoding 
switch, of the type having a stationary contact spring element 
with multiple spring contact fingers that are urged axially 
into engagement with selected coded terminal elements by an 
arrangement of axial cams on the underside of a rotor. Rotary encoding switches, of the type mentioned above, are 
known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,400,597 
- Bruder et al.; U.S. Patent No. 5,008,498 - Yamazaki; and U.S. 
Patent No. 5,010,214 - Yamazaki. In such switches, a 
stationary spring contact, or "spider", having multiple spring 
contact arms, is fixed within a housing between a rotor and a 
plurality of fixed coded electrical terminals, so that the 
spring arms are axially movable to make and break electrical 
contact with the terminals. A rotor is provided with a 
plurality of axially-extending camming elements on the surface 
facing the spider. As the rotor is turned, the camming 
elements are brought into and out of engagement with cam 
follower structures on each of the contact arms, whereby the 
arms are displaced axially into contact with a selected 
terminal as the rotor is turned, in accordance with the pattern 
of the camming elements. When the cam follower structure on an 
arm is not engaged by a cam, the resilience of the arm causes 
it to move axially out of engagement with the terminal, thereby  
 
breaking contact therewith. There has been a long term trend for higher degrees of 
miniaturization of electronic components. Consistent with that 
trend, components such as rotary switches have been 
substantially reduced in size, and further size reductions are 
still demanded. For example, surface mounted components, 
including rotary switches, are now commonly made smaller than 
10 mm on a side, and components of as little as 4 to 5 mm on a 
side are in increasing demand. The structure of the prior art rotary switches, of the 
type described above, makes such ultra-miniaturization 
difficult to achieve while maintaining performance criteria, 
such as accuracy and reliability. For example, the device 
described in the above-referenced patent to Bruder et al. 
employs a spider having radial contact arms of substantially 
uniform total length, each having a single cam follower tab. 
Each of the tabs is located at a different unique radius, for 
actuation by a cam lobe located at the corresponding radius on 
the facing surface of the rotor. Electrical contact between
