<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of a tablet of increased 
strength, and to tablets when made by said method. The method is particularly useful 
in the manufacture of tablets, that contain pharmaceutically active agents which are 
difficult to compress; that are soft and chewable; and that are fast-disintegrating and 
porous. Pharmaceuticals are often administered orally in the form of a tablet. The tablet 
is usually manufactured by combining tablet ingredients and compressing the 
combined ingredients in a mold. Due to the compression, tablets of mechanical 
stability are formed capable of withstanding disintegration during handling including 
removal from the mold, packing and transport. Mechanical stability depends on many 
factors, one of which is the compressibility of the pharmaceutically active agent in the 
tablet, particularly when large amounts of the agent are contained in a single tablet, and 
another one of which is the porosity of the tablet. The porosity of a tablet relates to ease of tablet disintegration not only during 
handling but also during administration whether orally or rectally, and whether 
disintegration takes place in the mouth, or in the stomach. An increase in the 
disintegration rate in the mouth facilitates administration to patients in general, and to 
the very young, the elderly, and non-human animals, in particular. Administration is 
also facilitated by use of soft chewable tablets. Since such tablets are soft, having a 
hardness of less than about 6 kg (6 kp), tablet friability is often a problem. Tablets of increased porosity and disintegration rates are disclosed in United 
States Patent Nos. 3,885,026, 4,134,943 and 4,305,502. These patents suggest various 
ways of dealing with the problems associated with the handling of such highly porous 
tablets. U.S. Patent No. 4,305,502 suggests reducing the amount of handling of the 
tablets by forming them in situ in a substrate having depressions for deposition of 
tablets. However, removal of tablets from these depressions is more difficult than 
simple removal from a bottle or tube. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,885,026 and 4,134,943 suggest increasing tablet strength of 
porous tablets by first compressing the tablet and then volatilizing a readily volatilizable 
solid adjuvant incorporated in the tablet to attain desired porosity. The maximum  
 
porosity obtained according to U.S. Patent No. 3,885,026 is 50% and preferably 10 to 
30%. French patent 2,231,365 and Belgian patent 668121 disclose water
