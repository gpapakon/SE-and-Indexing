<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR PREPARING MIXED METAL OXIDES The present invention relates to a process for preparing mixed metal oxides by cation-exchange from anionic carbonate-containing compounds. Mixed metal oxide phases known in the prior art have a wide variety of applications including use by themselves or as components in catalysts, corrosion resistant coatings, glazes, electrically conducting coatings, pigments, cosmetics, fillers, pharmaceuticals, plastics additives, alloy precursors and phosphors.Mixed metal oxides may consist of single phases, comprised of two or more metal species in chemical combination with oxygen, or of intimate mixtures of two or more phases. Industrial processes known in the prior art for preparation of mixed metal oxides include:(i) Solid state reaction between intimate mixtures of precursor oxide carbonate or other phases in definite proportions, generally at elevated temperatures, to produce a mixed metal oxide.This process often suffers from the necessity to employ severe reaction conditions and may require one or more cycles of grinding and heating to achieve complete reaction. (ϋ) Decomposition of precursor complexes containing mixtures of the metals in chemical combination or in solid solution in definite proportions. Known processes in the prior art have been of limited application as there has been a limited number of chemical combinations which are readily available for conversion to the oxide form. These can be produced by co-precipitation of an insoluble species, such as a hydroxide or carbonate, from aqueous or other solutions. Such procedures require that a set of conditions (eg pH, solvent) can be found to dissolve all the components before precipitation. Similarly, methods relying on solid solution formation in the precursor require similarity in chemical properties between the metal 

 precursors. Sol-gel techniques have been successful in preparing mixed oxides. However, the cost of precursor species (generally alkoxides) can be extremely high. Prior art synthesis procedures for mixed oxide phases include the manufacture of the so-called β-aluminas such as, Ba0.6Al20_ and La_03.11A1203. These oxides are used as solid electrolytes and as stable support materials for high temperature catalytic reactions, and may be prepared utilizing the following methods:(i) Hydrolysis of mixed metal alkoxides, in which Ba metal and Al(iso-OPr)-, are stirred and refluxed at 80°C in 2-propanol under „ atmosphere, followed by hydrolysis to form mixed hydroxide. Calcination at high
