<ABSTRACT>
The machine has a pump (8) with a pressostat (10) for the metering at 
controlled pressure of the perfusion liquid to the bag (9) incorporated in 

the machine, as well as means for supplying compressed air to the filter (17) 
in the bag (9) when it has been filled in order the check the bubble point, 

comprising a compressor, pressostat, purifying filter (15), pressure 
transductor and connections to the liquid pipe (11) as well as a suspended 

support (16) for controlling the filling of the bag (9), associated with the 
devices for weighing and detecting the bubble point, to which support (16) 

the bag (9) to be filled is coupled by suspension, having a safety system 
for the handling of the bag which comprises front gates (28) for closing the 

handling zone of the bags (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
automatically filling in a sterile manner and checking 
immediately afterwards the integrity of the filter, for 
bags for perfusion liquids, providing its function with 
advantageous features of novelty and usefulness. EP-A-476,194 discloses a pre-sterilized bag set 
for use in a method of filling individual bags of the bag 
set with a defined volume of sterile solution, the pre-sterilized 
bag set being composed of a heat sealable 
thermoplastic polymer and comprising a plurality of 
preformed, unfilled, individual bags of defined volume, 
the bag set having a single inlet at the one end of the 
bag set for the introduction of a sterile solution to 
packaged and a single fill tube connected to the inlet, 
the single fill tube extending generally the length of the 
bag set, and a plurality of short, individual bag fill 
tubes extending from the single fill tube to each of the 
individual bags of the bag set. The apparatus to which the present invention relates 
is combined with the use of bags for perfusion liquids, in 
particular the bags corresponding to the Applicants' own 
invention, which is the subject of Spanish Utility Model nº 
9103692. Among other highly advantageous technical points, 
the said bags for perfusion liquids are characterised by 
their being provided with a sterilising filter (with pores 
of 0'22 µm diameter or less) which is highly efficient and 
enables the perfusion liquids to be sterilised directly. The apparatus which is the subject of the present  
 
invention is set out in Claim 1. Essentially, the apparatus to which the present 
patent relates comprises a monobloc body with a 
dynamometric suspension support for an individual bag for  
 
perfusion liquids which also includes a sensor which, by 
means of an electronic system, is to detect the passage of 
air through the filter if the "bubble point" is lower than 
necessary for ensuring the type and/or integrity of the 
above-mentioned filter, both conditions being necessary 
for ensuring their sterilising condition, and furthermore 
comprising the means for generating the air compressed to 
a suitable pressure for checking the "bubble point", and 
the means for driving liquid at a pressure which is not 
lower than the above "bubble point", by means of a special 
pump which can receive liquid from a device of larger 
dimensions, and pass it to the inlet of the bag through 
the sterilising filter, passing from this phase, when the 
bag has reached the programmed weight, to the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the sterile filling of sterile 
bags (9) for perfusion liquids provided with a sterilising filter 

(17), and for checking this filling comprising 

means (6-8; 10-12) for metering, at controlled pressure, the 
perfusion liquid to a bag (9) incorporated in the machine; 
means (23) for controlling the filling of the bag (9) 
incorporated in the machine, 
  
 

characterised in that it comprises: 

means (13, 14, 15) for supplying compressed air to the filter (17) 
in the bag (9) when it has been filled, in order to check the bubble 

point; and 
means (21) for determining that the bubble point of the 
filter is not lower than necessary. 
Apparatus for the sterile filling of sterile 
bags for perfusion liquids and for checking this filling 

according to claim 1, characterised in that the means for 
metering the perfusion liquid to the bags to be filled 

comprises a pump (8) with a pressostat for the liquid which is 
fed from a larger capacity container (6) attached to the 

machine, and supplies the machine via a duct (11) incorporating 
a pressure transducer (10), and which is supported on an 

intermediate unit at which, in addition, the air pipe (13) is 
connected. 
Apparatus for the sterile filling of sterile 
bags for perfusion liquids and for checking this filling 

according to claim 1, characterised in that the means for 
supplying compressed air for checking the bubble point 

comprise a compressor, pressostat, purifying filter (15), 
pressure transducer (14) and connection (12) to the liquid pipe from 

the intermediate assembly supporting the air and liquid 
control cylinders (19, 20). 
Apparatus for the sterile filling of sterile 
bags for perfusion liquids and for checking this filling 

according to claim 1, characterised in that the means for 
checking the filling of the bags consist of a suspended 

support (16) associated with the devices for weighing and  
 

detecting the bubble point and to which support the bag (9) to 
be filled is coupled by suspension. 
Apparatus for the sterile filling of sterile 
bags for perfusion liquids and for checking this filling, 

according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
incorporates a safety system for the handling of the bags,
