<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane 
(bisphenol A) comprising the steps of 

subjecting phenol and acetone to condensation reaction in the 
presence of an acid catalyst to form a reaction mixture, 

crystallizing an adduct of bisphenol A and phenol from the 
reaction mixture, separating the crystallized adduct from the 

reaction mixture and separating the phenol from the adduct 
which process comprising further steps of bringing the 

reaction mixture in the form of a liquid from which the adduct 
has been removed into contact with an a
cid catalyst (e.g. 
cation-exchange resin of sulfonic acid type) to effect 

isomerizing treatment and recycling it through the 
crystallization system. According to the above process, 

bisphenol A is efficiently recovered from the mother liquor 
and bisphenol A as the objective product is obtained in high 

yield and high purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for
producing 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (hereinafter
referred to as "bisphenol A"). More particularly, it
relates to a process for producing bisphenol A in high yield
by efficiently recovering bisphenol A through crystallization
from the mother liquor of the reaction mixture obtained
in the condensation reaction of phenol and acetone.It is well known that bisphenol A is an important
compound as a starting raw material for epoxy resins or
engineering plastics such as polycarbonate resins and
polyarylate resins, and accordingly, the demand thereof tends to
expand year by year.Bisphenol A is produced by the condensation reaction of
excess phenol with acetone in the presence of an acidic
catalyst and, as the case may be, a sulfur compound as
cocatalyst. The reaction product thus formed contains, in
addition to the objective bisphenol A, excess unreacted
phenol, a small amount of unreacted acetone, the catalyst,
water formed by the reaction and other reaction by-products.As the above-mentioned reaction by-products, mention may
be made of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane
(hereinafter abbreviated to "o,p'-isomer") as the main
component, dimer of isopropenylphenol, trisphenol, polyphenol
and undesirable colored substances. Bisphenol A, 
particularly when used as the starting raw material for
polycarbonate resins, polyarylate resins or the like, is
required to be highly pure and of high-quality without
coloration.A variety of investigations have heretofore been made on
the process for producing high-quality bisphenol A. EP-A-0 486 109 relates to a process for the production of a
bisphenol with improved product purity and yield. The
process comprises the steps of reacting a carbonyl compound
with a stoichiometric excess of a phenolic
compound, passing the reaction product mixture to a
crystallization zone to produce a crystalline bisphenol and
a mother liquor, contacting in an isomerization zone, the
mother liquor with an acidic ion-exchange resin as
isomerization catalyst, contacting the isomerization
reaction product mixture with a guard bed and recovering the
bisphenol from the thus treated isomerization reaction
product mixture.EP-A-0 210 366 relates to a process for making bisphenol A
by feeding phenol and acetone into a condensation reactor.
The reaction mixture is separated in a crystallizer to
provide the recovery of bisphenol A and the recycling back
to the condensation reactor of a mixture of phenol and
bisphenol A isomers through
