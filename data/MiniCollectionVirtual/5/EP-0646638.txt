<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for lubricating
ceramic-containing engines and a class of lubricants
suitable for such use.There has recently been interest in improving the fuel
efficiency of internal combustion engines. One route to
this goal has been research toward development of engines
with ceramic components. Ceramic components are useful
because they are generally believed to be able to withstand
higher operating temperatures than can customary metal
parts. Modified engines which make use of higher operating
temperatures can exhibit more efficient fuel use and are
sometimes operated with reduced cooling requirements. As
a result, however, there is a need for lubricants useful in
such ceramic-containing engines which exhibit good high
temperature properties such as oxidative and thermal
stability. This is particularly true since the lubricant
is sometimes used as a coolant fuel for selective engine
components (e.g. cylinder heads and liners and pistons).
Furthermore, lubrication of ceramic parts, including
ceramic-coated parts, i.e. ceramic-ceramic and ceramic-metal
interfaces, can be more demanding than lubrication of
ordinary metal-metal interfaces. This is in part because
of the higher temperatures encountered, but also because of
the greater hardness of ceramics, compared to metal,
results in increased pressure and stress at points of
contact. Moreover, the chemical interaction of ceramics
with lubricants and lubricant additives can be different in
certain respects from the chemical interaction with metals.
Accordingly, the lubrication of ceramic-containing engines,
and in particular high temperature, low heat rejection
ceramic-containing engines, presents a technical challenge.PCT publication WO 91/13133, September 5, 1991,
discloses a high temperature functional fluid comprising a 
synthetic base oil, at least one phenolic compound, and at
least one non-phenolic antioxidant. The synthetic base oil
can be synthetic ester oils including those prepared from
polyhydric alcohols and alkanoic acids, including fatty
acids which contain from 5 to about 30 carbon atoms such as
saturated straight chain fatty acids or the corresponding
branched chain fatty acids or unsaturated fatty acids. The
functional fluids are useful as lubricating compositions
for lubricating engines operating at high temperatures such
as high temperature, low heat rejection diesel engines.U.S. Patent 4,879,052, Mullin, November 7, 1989,
discloses improving friction and fuel consumption especially

A process for lubricating a ceramic-containing
internal combustion engine comprising:


(a) supplying to the engine a lubricant comprising at least
one ester base fluid selected from:


(i) an ester of a polyhydroxy compound and a monocarboxylic
acylating agent, and
(ii) an ester of polyhydroxy compound and a combination
of a dicarboxylic acylating agent and a

monocarboxylic acylating agent; and
(b) operating the engine; wherein the monocarboxylic acylating
agent has up to 15 carbon atoms, the dicarboxylic acylating

agent has up to 15 carbon atoms, the polyhydroxy compound has 2
to 10 hydroxyl groups and 2 to 20 carbon atoms, and the molar

ratio of monocarboxylic acylating agent to dicarboxylic
acylating agent is at least 3:1.
The process of claim 1 wherein the ceramic-containing
engine is a low heat rejection sump-lubricated

diesel engine.
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
engine is operated at a temperature of at least 250°C

as measured within the cylinder wall at the top ring
reversal position.

polyhydroxy compound is trimethylolpropane or inositol.
The process of any preceding claim wherein the
monocarboxylic acylating agent is a mixture of (a) a

branched monocarboxylic acylating agent having four or five
carbon atoms and (b) a branched monocarboxylic acylating

agent having 7 to 15 carbon atoms.
The process of claim 5 wherein the monocarboxylic
acylating agent has 
neo

to the carboxylic group. 
The process of any preceding claim wherein the
molar amount of branched monocarboxylic acylating agent in

acylating agent.
The process of any preceding claim wherein the
dicarboxylic acylating agent is adipic acid.
