<DESCRIPTION>
Sulfur contaminants in fossil fuels can create problems
in refinery processes which can be costly to rectify.
The sulfur contaminants that occur in fossil fuels
fall into either of the following general classes: mineralized
(inorganic, e.g., pyritic) sulfur and organic
sulfur (sulfur that is covalently bound to carbonaceous
molecules, referred to as organosulfur compounds). The
presence of sulfur has been correlated with corrosion of
pipeline, pumping and refining equipment, and with premature
breakdown of combustion engines. Sulfur also
poisons many catalysts which are used in the refining of
fossil fuels. Moreover, the atmospheric emission of
sulfur combustion products, such as sulfur dioxide, leads
to the form of acid deposition known as acid rain. Acid
rain has lasting deleterious effects on aquatic and forest
ecosystems, as well as on agricultural areas located
downwind of combustion facilities. Monticello, D.J. and
W.R. Finnerty, (1985) Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 39:371-389.
Regulations such as the Clean Air Act of 1964 require the
removal of sulfur, either pre- or post-combustion, from
virtually all coal- and petroleum-based fuels. Conformity
with such legislation has become increasingly problematic
due to the rising need to utilize lower grade, higher-sulfur
fossil fuels as clean-burning, low-sulfur petroleum
reserves become depleted, as well as the progressive
reductions in sulfur emissions required by regulatory
authorities. Monticello, D.J. and J.J. Kilbane, "Practical
Considerations in Biodesulfurization of Petroleum",
IGT's3dIntl.Symp.onGas, Oil, Coal, andEnv.Biotech.,
(Dec. 3-5, 1990) New Orleans, LA.One technique which is currently employed for the
pre-combustion removal of organic sulfur from liquid 
fossil fuels, e.g., petroleum, is hydrodesulfurization
(HDS). HDS is suitable for the desulfurization of fossil
fuels wherein organosulfur compounds account for a significant,
e.g., a major, proportion of all sulfur contaminants
present. HDS is thus useful for treating crude oil
or bitumen, petroleum distillate fractions or refining
intermediates, liquid motor fuels, and the like. HDS is
more particularly described in Shih, S.S. et al., "Deep
Desulfurization of Distillate Components", Abstract No.
