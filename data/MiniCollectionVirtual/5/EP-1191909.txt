<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for a leg prosthesis (10) provided with a foot (12), which is connected to the leg prosthesis via an articulated axle (11), whereby first means (13, 14, 16-18, 30-33, 38) are arranged to provide a limited rotation of the foot relative the leg prosthesis from an initial position, in which position the leg prosthesis and the foot have a fixed angle relative each other, and second means (16-26) are arranged to provide a step-less adjustment of the fixed angle between the leg prosthesis and the foot in the initial position. According to the invention the first means (13, 14, 16-18, 30-33, 38) comprise a resilient element (14), which first end thereof is connected to the foot (12) via an elongated element (13) and which second end is connected to the leg prosthesis so that the leg prosthesis can be rotated relative the foot against the effect of the spring force of the resilient element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device in a leg prosthesis provided with a foot, which is
connected to the leg prosthesis via an articulated axle, whereby first means are arranged to
provide a limited rotation of the foot relative the leg prosthesis from an initial adjusted position, in
which position the leg prosthesis and the foot have fixed an initial adjusted angle relative each other, and
second means for a step-less adjustment of fixed said angle between the
leg prosthesis and the foot wherein the first means comprise a
resilient element having a spring force limiting rotational movement of
the foot relative to the leg prosthesis in the initial adjusted position during
walking.It is well known among prosthesis wearers that downhill walking is problematic. If the
prosthesis wearer does not have the possibility of adjusting the angle of the foot, the walk
downhill gets such that only the heel has contact with the ground. Above a certain degree of
foot angle it is difficult to bear up the body weight so that the knee does not collapse
because of the lack of essential groups of muscles. Therefore, prosthesis wearers often
choose to walk sidewards when walking downhills.Further, prosthesis wearers who, have not got a foot which is vertically adjustable, have
problems changing to another shoe with a different heel height, and to rapidly choose to
walk without shoes. Individual, vertical adjustment of the foot even reduces problems with
pain in the back and worn out hips.Through for instance US patent document 2,749,557 is known an adjustable foot, however
it is only adjustable to three different angular positions.US patent 2,470,480 shows an artificial foot having hydraulic custioning
means between the ankle and the sole plate. A needle value is provided for controlling
the passage of hydraulic fluid so that the walking action can be adapted to a particular person.Furthermore. SE-B-456 134 shows a prosthesis foot where the angular positions of the foot
are adjusted with a screw existing in the heel of the foot. The prosthesis wearer must turn
the screw a number of turns to change the angle position, which requires a certain work
effort. The principle of changing the angle shown in this document has the great 
disadvantage that the length of the leg changes, which results in that the prosthesis wearer
can have one leg shorter or longer than the other in certain situations.Further, SE-B-469 780 shows an additional example of a prosthesis foot where the angle
position of the foot can be adjusted, in

Arrangement for a leg prosthesis (10) provided with a foot (12), which is connected to

the leg prosthesis via an articulated axle (11), whereby first means (13, 14, 16-18, 30-33,
38) are arranged to provide a limited rotation of the foot relative to the leg prosthesis from

an initial adjusted position, in which position the leg prosthesis and the foot have an initial
adjusted fixed angle relative to each other, and second means (16-26) for step-less adjustment of

said fixed angle between the leg prosthesis and the foot, wherein the first means (13, 14, 16-18,
30-33, 38) comprise a resilient element (14) having a spring force limiting rotational

movement of the foot relative to the leg prosthesis in the initial adjusted position during
walking,
characterized in,


that
 the second means (16-26) comprise an element (17), which is displaceable relative the
leg prosthesis (10), and means (18, 21) to hold the displaceable element in a desired

displacement position, whereby the displaceable element (17), set in its initial adjusted
position, at one end bears on a portion (38) of the foot (12) and at its second end on the

resilient element (14), which via an elongated element (13) is connected to the foot.
Arrangement according to claim 1,
characterized in,


that
 the displacable means comprise a piston (17) with outwardly directed ring flanges,
which piston is displacably arranged in a cylinder (16) attached to the leg prosthesis (10),

and the means for holding the piston in desired displacement position relative the cylinder
comprise a ring wall (18) projecting inwards from the cylinder, which wall divides the

space between the ring flanges of the piston in two chambers, and a two-way valve (21),
which in opened position provides flow of the medium existing in the chambers between

these and in closed position prevents such flow. 
Arrangement according to claim 2,
characterized in,


that
 the elongated element (13) extends through a central axial channel (29) in the piston
(17) and through a central axial passage in the resilient element and is connected, via a

washer (33) of rigid material, to that end of the resilient element (14), which is opposite the
end which bears on the piston.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in,


that
 the elongated element is constituted by flexible material.
Arrangement according to claim 4,
characterized in,


that
 the elongated element (13) is constituted by a cord or wire or of a belt of a material
with little extensibility.
