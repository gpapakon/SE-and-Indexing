<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing
certain 3,4,4-trisubstituted-piperidinyl-N-alkylcarboxylates,
new intermediates and their congeners.
Finally, this invention provides stable crystalline compounds
and formulations useful as peripheral opioid antagonists.A substantial body of evidence indicates that
peripheral opioid peptides and their receptors have a major
physiological role in the regulation of gut motility.
Consequently, gastrointestinal disorders such as idiopathic
constipation and irritable bowel syndrome may relate to a
dysfunction of opioid receptor mediated control, and agents
which act as antagonists for these receptors may benefit a
patient suffering from such a dysfunction.The N-substituted piperidines, prepared using the
process and intermediates of this invention are useful as
peripherally-selective opioid antagonists. One particularly
desirable 3,4,4-trisubstituted-piperidinyl-N-alkylcarboxylate
is (2S,3R,4R)([[2-[[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]methyl]-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]amino]acetic
acid
(1).
A generic process to prepare (αS, 3R, 4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)
-3,4-dimethyl-α-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine
propanoic acid ethyl ester (2), a useful intermediate for the
preparation of 1, is known to the skilled artisan. Zimmerman
describes this process in U.S. Patent 5,250,542
(hereincorporated by reference). However, this process
produces a mixture of stereoisomeric products which prevents
its utilization in a practical commercial process. The
preparation of the desired compound of Formula 1 requires a
tedious chromatographic separation with only 13% yield for
the isomer separation. Further, each intermediate is
isolated as a "gum-like" product due to the presence of the
undesired isomer. The "gum-like" product precludes
purification of any intermediate without chromatography and
is highly undesirable for commercial purposes.The process of this invention now provides a
synthetic route which will provide crystalline intermediates,
without epimerization to facilitate the commercial
preparation of 1 and C1-C6 alkyl esters thereof.
Additionally, the process of this invention produces. a
crystalline solid of 1 and C1-C6 alkyl esters thereof in
acceptable yields. Finally, the synthetic process of this
invention includes crystalline intermediates to provide both
enrichment and purification of the desired product.This invention provides a highly desirable stable
crystalline (2S, 3R, 4R) ([[2-[[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]
methyl]-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]amino
