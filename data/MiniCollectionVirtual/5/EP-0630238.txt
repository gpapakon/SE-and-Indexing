<ABSTRACT>
Methods of reducing post-prandial fluctuations in plasma levels of large, neutral amino acids (LNAA), as well as compositions useful in that method. The foods and compositions comprise a carbohydrate to protein ratio of from about 3:1 to about 10:1 and, in a specific embodiment, a ratio of 7:1, which results in minimizing the variability in responses individuals exhibit to drugs which are LNAA.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REDUCING POST-PRANDIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF LARGE NEUTRAL AMINO ACIDS (LNAA) This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/849,246 filed March 11, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/332,871, filed April 3, 1989, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.BackgroundTreatment of some diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease, includes administration of a drug which is a large neutral amino acid {LNAA) and which must cross the blood-brain barrier to be effective. For example, L-dopa, alphamethyldopa (Aldomet) and 5-hydroxytryptophan, which are LNAA, can be administered in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease, hypertension or myoclonus. Patients who take such drugs may exhibit variability in their responses to them and may suffer adverse effects, such as L-Dopa induced dyskinesia, from them.It would be useful to have a means by which an individual's response to such drugs can be controlled and the adverse effects reduced.Summary of the InventionThe present invention pertains to a method of reducing post-prandial fluctuations in plasma LNAA levels in an individual, particularly for the purpose of reducing variability in the individual's response to treatment with drugs which are themselves LNAA. It further relates to compositions for administration to an individual to reduce fluctuations in plasma concentrations of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) . As used herein, LNAA includes amino acids which have a single amino group and a single carboxyl group, for 

example, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, valine, phenylalanine and tryptophan.The present composition comprises an appropriate ratio of carbohydrates to protein to reduce fluctuations in plasma LNAA levels, when administered to an individual. The ratio of carbohydrate to protein used can vary from about 3:1 to about 10:1, depending on the individual to whom such a composition is administered, with a ratio 7:1 having been found to be particularly effective. Such characteristics as body weight and plasma amino acid responses will be considered in determining an appropriate carbohydrate to protein ratio for an individual. The present invention also relates to methods of administering foods or compositions which minimize post-prandial fluctuations in plasma LNAA levels. Administration of such compositions or of foods selected to contain a carbohydrate to protein ratio of from about 3:1 to about 10:1 is particularly valuable in minimizing the variability in
