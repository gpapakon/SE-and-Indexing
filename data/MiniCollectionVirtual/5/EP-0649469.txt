<ABSTRACT>
Gene activating sequences which activate the expression of other bacterial genes, which are latent or expressed at low levels, are provided. The gene activating sequences confer the ability to produce several metabolites and may be transferred to bacterial strains. The transformed biocontrol agents are active to inhibit the growth of the fungal pathogens.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GENE ACTIVATING ELEMENTField of the Invention The present invention relates to the identification, isolation, cloning and use of genetic elements which contribute to the activation of genes in bacterial strains. More specifically, the invention relates to the identification of two classes of genetic elements which interact with each other in the activation of genes in bacteria. Manipulation of either or both types of element can be used to manipulate bacterial phenotype.Background of the Invention It has been recognized that crops grown in some soils are naturally resistant to certain fungal pathogens. Furthermore, soils that are conducive to the development of these diseases can be rendered suppressive, or resistant, by the addition of small quantities of soil from a suppressive field. Scher et al. Phytopathology 70:421 (1980) . Conversely, suppressive soils can be made conducive to fungal diseases by a toclaving, indicating that the factors responsible for disease control are biological. Subsequent research has demonstrated that root colonizing bacteria are responsible for this phenomenon known as biological disease control (BDC) . 

Baker et al., Biological control of plant pathogens, (Freeman Press, San Francisco) (1974) .In many cases, the most efficient strains of biological disease controlling bacteria are fluorescent Pseudomonads. Weller et al. , Phytopathology, 73:463-469 (1983). These bacteria have also been shown to promote plant growth in the absence of a specific fungal pathogen by the suppression of detrimental rhizosphere microflora present in most soils. Kloepper et al., Phytopathology 71:1020-1024 (1981). Important plant pathogens that have been effectively controlled by seed inoculation with these bacteria include Gaemannomyces gramminis, the causative agent of take-all in wheat, Cook et al., Soil Biol. Biochem 8:269-273 (1976) and Pvthium and Rhizoctonia, pathogens involved in damping off of cotton. Howell et al.. Phytopathology 69:480-482 (1979). Rhizoctonia is a particularly problematic plant pathogen for several reasons. First, it is capable of infecting a wide range of crop plants. Second, there are no commercially available chemical fungicides that are effective in controlling the fungus. Because of these circumstances, an inhibitor against R. solani would be of substantial interest as a potential control for this pathogen.Many biological disease controlling Pseudomonas strains produce antibiotics that inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens.
