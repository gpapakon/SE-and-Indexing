<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optical cable design 
which comprises an optical cable part (1) and two strain 

relief elements (2) which are placed diametrically with 
respect to one another on each side of the optical cable 

part (1). The strain relief elements (2) are combined 
with the optical cable part (1) by means of cladding (4) 

in one piece with the jacketing (3) of the strain relief 
elements and optical cable part. The strain relief 

elements (2) preferably comprise metal elements (9) which 
can also be used as current feeding elements. One or both 

of the strain relief elements (2) can be cut out for 
producing a more flexible cable. The invention provides 

a small-dimension combination cable for optical communication 
which can be used both for air, ground, 

channelling and indoor installations. The design of the 
cable provides good protective characteristics in spite 

of its simplicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical cable 
of the kind specified in the preamble of claim 1. The cable design 
is intended for small optical cables, of the type including 
subscriber cables or cables for use in a thinly populated 
area. By virtue of a novel design, a combination cable is 
obtained which can be used for air, ground, channelling and 
indoor installations. The cable design comprises suitable 
reinforcing elements which, if necessary, can be removed 
for obtaining flexibility. Typical known optical cable designs are adapted to 
the laying environments for which they are intended, for 
example air cables or ground cables. The design differences 
are due to the fact that different characteristics of cable 
designs have set the tone. For example, in ground laying, 
the aim has been to make the cable resistant to clamping 
damage, and the aim for air cables has been a self-supporting 
design. Present types of optical cables add technically 
very advanced trace elements which make the cables stiff 
and awkward for domestic installation. For air cables, round cables with non-metallic 
strain relief elements of KEVLARâ„¢ and trace elements with 
strain relief elements of fibre-reinforced plastic have 
been used, on the one hand, and figure-8 cables with supporting 
strains of steel or KEVLAR, on the other hand. 
These cables are also stiff and unsuitable for domestic 
installations and also unsuitable for ploughing in ground 
laying due to the fact that elongations can arise in the 
optical cable part. US 4,188,088 shows a number of embodiments of 
optical elements for use in optical transmission. Figures 
4, 5 and 7, especially, show optical elements in the form  
 
of two optical fibres which are diametrically connected to 
a reinforcing element 6, for example a sythetic fibre with 
a high modulus of elasticity or a metal, by means of jacketing 
8 of the same material which surrounds the optical 
fibres 1 and the strain relief element 6. The optical 
fibres thus surround the strain relief element 6. In this 
design, there is a risk of elongation and clamping of the 
optical cable parts since they are located outside the 
strain relief element, for example with spiral twisting of 
the cable and clamping of the cable. US 4,763,983 describes an optical cable in which 
nylon-covered optical fibres 14 together with a fibre-reinforced 
centre element 12, a soft polypropylene yarn 
layer 16 and rubber tape 18 are connected to a support 
element 22 by means of a jacketing 24. WO-A1 83/3494 calls
