<ABSTRACT>
A device for bridging an expansion joint (1) in a roadway (2), particularly in bridgedecks, has at least one intermediate profile (5) which is inserted into the expansion joint (1), runs in the direction of the expansion joint (1) and is connected to the joint edges (9) via elastomeric supports on both sides so as to carry away loads. To increase the adjusting travel, it is proposed that the elastomeric supports consist of individual block bearings (7) which are distributed over the length of the intermediate profile (5) and are supported on the joint edge (9) and on the respectively adjacent intermediate profile (5a, 5b).

Device for bridging an expansion joint (1) in a roadway (2), particularly in bridge-decks, 
with at least one intermediate profile (5, 5a, 5b) inserted into the expansion 

joint (1), extending in the direction of the expansion joint (1), said intermediate profile 
(5, 5a, 5b) being supported on the edge of the joint (9) or on the respectively adjoining 

intermediate profile (5, 5a, 5b) with the aid of elastomeric bearing blocks (7) distributed 
over the length of the intermediate profile (5, 5a, 5b), characterised in that each 

intermediate profile (5, 5a, 5b) has, distributed along its length, cross-bearers (6, 6a, 
6b), which are respectively supported on the edges of the joint (9) or on the respectively 

adjoining intermediate profiles (5, 5a, 5b) via two elastomeric bearing blocks (7) 
provided on the ends of the cross-bearers.
