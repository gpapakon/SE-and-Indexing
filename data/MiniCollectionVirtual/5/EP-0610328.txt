<ABSTRACT>
A needle catheter particularly for endovasal use, including a needle-guide or metallic mandrel (1) fitted with an end grip (2), and a catheter (4) with end casing (5). Between the end grip (2) of the metallic needle (1) and the casing (5) of the catheter (4), there is an extensible element (9), (9') acting as a cover for the metallic needle (1) after its extraction and with at least one means of blockage (10), (10'), (33) of interception and/or of needle (1) blockage being foreseen in the casing (5) of the catheter, movable from a position where it does not obstruct the lumen (11) of the catheter, to a position where it occludes the lumen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a needle catheter to be 
placed in the lumen of a blood vessel, for example for 
the administration of anaesthetics drugs or drips or 
for similar uses and equipped with a safety device, in 
particular against possible injury to the user or to 
other personell. A needle catheter consists of a needle-guide or 
metallic mandrel enclosed in a catheter made of plastic 
material. In practice, the whole is inserted in the 
blood vessel like a normal needle and then the metallic 
needle-guide is extracted, to allow, for example, a 
drip to be connected to the catheter for administration 
to the patient. This type of needle catheter is superseding 
ordinary metallic needles because of its indisputable 
advantages among which are: ease of endovasal 
positioning, greater freedom of movement for the 
patient who can move his limbs without danger of 
damaging the blood vessel and longer lasting patency. However, two major disadvantages must be added to 
these qualities and these represent a potential danger 
of transmission of infective pathology. These disadvantages are connected with the 
extraction of the needle-guide or metallic mandrel for 
the connection of the catheter to a drip or other 
device and the consequent bleeding. Whereas it is possible to protect oneself from the 
blood flow by using gloves for example and thereby 
considerably reducing the risk of contagion, this is  
 
not possible, either during the extraction of the 
metallic needle or later on, so that it is easy to be 
pricked and possibly infect oneself because surgical 
gloves are by no means imperforable. US-A-4.944.728 which is considered to represent the closest 
prior art with respect to the present invention describes a catheter placement 
device comprising an internal sheath fixed to the 
catheter and an external sheath connected to the needle 
through a rod. The retraction of the external sheath 
allows the needle to be housed in the internal sheath. 
However this device is complex in structure, 
principally due to the provision of said connection 
rod, and is not safe in use, due to the absence of 
means for intercepting the flow of blood after the 
retraction of the needle. The object of the invention is to eliminate these 
disadvantages, and in particular the risk of injury to 
the user or other personell with the metallic needle-guide. This object is achieved with the needle catheter 
according to the invention, which is characterized by 
the features of the appended claim 1. A flexible lateral branch for

Needle catheter, including a metallic needle-guide 
(1) with an end grip (2), a catheter (4) with related 

grip or end casing (5) covering the needle (1), and an 
extensible element (9'), situated between the grip (2) 

of the needle (1) and the casing (5) of the catheter 
(4), in such a way as to cover the needle (1) when this 

is retracted, said extensible 
element (9') consisting of a telescopic group including 

several tubular elements (20), (21), (22) insertable 
one in the other, characterized in that the needle (1) being fixed to 

the front part of the inner element (20), in that a blocking system 
(27), (28) is provided for the needle (1) in the retracted position 

made integral with said tubular elements (20-22), and in that means 
(33) are provided for intercepting the flow in the lumen (11) of the 

casing (5) of the catheter (4). 
Needle catheter according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means for blocking the needle in the 

retracted position consists of elastic stop tongues 

(27), (28), set in the walls of the tubular elements 
(20), (21) or (21), (22) and bearing on the ends of the 

adjacent elements (21), (22) or (20), (21), and in that 
stop means (23, 24; 25, 26) are provided for limiting 

the maximum extention of the tubular elements (20, 21, 
22). 
Needle catheter according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a rubber seal (30) closure is 

provided, near the end of the telescopic group (9) and 
attached to the casing (5) of the catheter (4), and in 

that at least a part (32) in spongy material is  
 

provided near the rubber seal (30). 
Needle catheter according to anyone of claims 1 to 3 
characterized in that said telescopic group (9') is 

fixed to the casing (5) of the catheter (4) in a 
movable fashion. 
Needle catheter according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said means for 

intercepting the flow in the lumen (11) of the casing 
(5) of the catheter (4) consists of a tap (33) operated 

through a lever (34), between a position in which it 
does not obstruct the lumen (11) and a position where 

it occludes the lumen. 
Needle catheter according to any of the claims from 
1 to 4, characterized in that said means for 

intercepting the flow consist of an adjustable vane 
movable from a raised position in which it does not 

obstruct the lumen (11) of the casing (5) of the 
catheter, to a lowered position in which it occludes 

the lumen. 
Needle catheter according to any of the claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that said means for intercepting 

the flow consist of a ball contained in a housing in 
the casing (5) of the catheter (4) and movable into the 

lumen (11) of the casing (5) by simple pressure. 
Needle catheter according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized by the fact that two means of 

interception and/or blocking are provided (33), between 
which the casing (5) of the catheter (4) is separated 

into two parts, held together by a screw thread, by 
grooves or by similar means. 
Needle catheter according to any of the preceding

lateral connection is provided above the said means 

of interception and/or blocking which are in the casing 
(5), or a further inlet cone connectable to a syringe 

or to a drip, using a 3 way valve.
