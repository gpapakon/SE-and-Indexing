<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for constructing a multi-part cylinder block (1), consisting of an upper housing part (2) and a lower housing part (3), for an internal combustion engine with at least one reciprocating piston, in which cooling spaces (8) bounded by a cylinder liner (4; 5) are provided, the housing parts (2; 3) being bolted together. In order to obtain a wide range of possibilities for the configuration of the cylinder block (1) with as little outlay on production as possible, the proposal is to manufacture each of the housing parts (2; 3) from a universal unfinished casting (2'; 2'' or 3'; 3''), the outside dimensions of the unfinished castings (2'; 2'' or 3'; 3'') - height (12', 17'; 12'', 17''), width (14', 19'; 14'', 19'') and depth (13', 18'; 13'', 18'') - being designed for application with a maximum piston stroke (21b), a minimum connecting rod ratio, a maximum compression distance (36b) and a maximum cylinder bore (20b), but the inside diameters (10; 15) of the unfinished castings (2'; 2'', 3'; 3'') are designed for a minimum cylinder bore (20a).

A method of producing a multi-part cylinder 
block (1) for an internal combustion engine 

having at least one reciprocating piston (35), 
the block comprising an upper housing part (2) 

and a lower housing part (3) in which coolant 
cavities (8) are bounded by a cylinder liner 

(4; 5), the parts (2; 3) of the housing being 
screwed or bolted together, 
characterised in 
that
, 

the two housing parts (2a, 3a; 2b, 3b) are 
each produced from cast blanks (2', 3'; 2'', 3'') 

capable of adjustment over a wide range to 
different engine design parameters such as 

piston stroke, bore, compression ratio and 
connecting rod ratio λ which is defined as the 

ratio of the crank throw (Rb) to the length of 
the connecting rod (Lb), 
the outside dimensions of the cast blanks 
(2'; 3'; 2'', 3''), namely height (12'; 17'; 

12'', 17''), width (14', 19'; 14'', 19'') and 
depth (13', 18'; 13'', 18''), being designed for 

use with maximum piston stroke (21b) minimum 
connecting rod ratio λ, maximum compression 

ratio (36b) and maximum cylinder bore (20b), 
but the inside diameter (10', 15'; 10'', 
15'') of the cast blanks (2', 3'; 2'', 3'') being 

designed for minimum bore (20a,)  
 
that the heights (12', 17'; 12'', 17'') of 
the cast blanks (2', 3'; 2'', 3'') are matched to 

the required engine parameters such as stroke 
(21), connecting rod ratio λ and compression 

ratio (36) by shortening of their end faces and 
that the bores (10', 15';; 10'', 15'') of the 
cast blanks (2', 3'; 2'', 3'') are matched to the 

desired cylinder liner diameter (20) by boring 
out. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the coolant cavities (8) in the cast blank 
parts (2'', 3'') for the upper (2) and lower 

housing parts (3) are designed for use at 
maximum piston stroke (21a), minimum connecting 

rod ratio λ, maximum compression ratio (36b) 
and minimum cylinder bore (20a) and are matched 

to the coolant action which is currently 
required by removing material from the inside 

walls (11, 16) of the housing parts (2, 3). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, with a dry 

cylinder liner (24) 
characterised in that
 the 
liner (24) is inserted in a co-axial sleeve (5) 

seated in the cylinder block (1). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the coolant cavities (8) 
in the cast blanks (2', 3') for the upper (2) 

and lower housing part (3) are designed for use 
with maximum piston stroke (21b) minimum 

connecting rod ratio λ maximum compression 
ratio (36b) and maximum cylinder bore (20a).  

 
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the coolant cavities are matched to the 
currently desired cooling action by the 

application of material to the inside walls 
(11, 16) of the housing parts (2, 3). 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterised in 
that
 the coolant cavities (8) are partially 
filled with cast-in resin (9).
