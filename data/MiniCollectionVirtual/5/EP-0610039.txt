<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with polymerization processes, and more 
particularly with suspension polymerization processes for making porous polymer 
particles. Porous polymeric particles having high surface area have been prepared by 
suspension polymerization wherein a discontinuous organic phase, i.e., droplets of 
monomeric reaction mixture, are suspended in a continuous aqueous phase and a 
"phase extender", i.e., a nonreactive low molecular weight diluent, is included in 
the monomeric reaction mixture. Organic solvents, e.g., xylene, that are soluble in 
the reaction mixture and insoluble in the continuous aqueous phase, are typically 
used as phase extenders. The suspended droplets of the reaction mixture are 
polymerized and the phase extender is then removed from the polymerized 
particles, e.g., by distillation, and recycled. The process of removing the phase 
extender from the particles can be tedious, time consuming and expensive. German Patent Application DE 1137 554 discloses a process wherein an 
inverted emulsion of water in a water insoluble monomer is dispersed in an 
aqueous medium and the monomer is polymerized to produce a porous polymer 
having an elevated softening point compared to a polymer of the same monomer 
prepared by conventional suspension polymerization processes. The polymers 
disclosed in the German application are not characterized with regard to surface 
area. The present invention provides a suspension polymerization process for 
making porous polymeric particles using a water soluble phase extender. The 
process includes suspending a discontinuous organic phase in a continuous 
aqueous phase. The organic phase comprises ethylenically unsaturated monomer, 
water soluble phase extender and surfactant in an amount effective to solubilize the 
water soluble phase extender in the monomer. The aqueous phase comprises 
diffusion barrier agent, dispersed in the aqueous phase, for limiting mass transfer of 
the water soluble phase extender from the organic phase into the aqueous phase. 
The monomer is then polymerized to form the porous polymeric particles. The  
 
water soluble phase extender, surfactant and diffusion barrier agent may then be 
removed from the polymer particles by washing the particles in water, and the 
washed particles may then be dried. In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous phase includes anti-emulsion agent, 
dissolved in the aqueous phase, for limiting interaction between the surfactant and 
the aqueous phase. In a preferred embodiment, the
