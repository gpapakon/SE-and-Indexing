<ABSTRACT>
A method for providing a coating on the exterior 
surfaces of a plurality of elongate members, such as wires 

(12), includes positioning them substantially parallel to 
each other, coating the exterior surfaces of each member 

with a coating, removing any excess coating from desired 
portions of each member and curing the coating to adhere 

the coating to each member (12). Preferably the coating is 
used to adhere adjacent members (12) together to form a 

continuous band and then this band is used to form staples 
or nails.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to coating and more 
particularly to a method and apparatus for providing a 
continuous in line process for coating elongate members 
used for mass producing coated fasteners, such as staples 
or nails, arranged in a strip or block for ease of 
handling and packaging as well as loading into a driving 
tool. A coating is utilised which is composed of 100% dry 
solids, is virtually free of solvent emissions when 
applied and during curing and covers substantially the 
entire exterior surface of each fastener. The coating 
protects the fastener against corrosion, adheres 
successive fasteners together into a strip or block and 
provides improved retention of the fastener when driven 
into a desired surface. Coating the exterior surfaces of fasteners frequently 
is desirable to protect fasteners from corrosion. Such 
coatings also are utilised to adhere a plurality of 
fasteners together into a strip or block for ease of 
handling with fastener driving or dispensing devices, such 
as a staple gun, nail gun or the like. For example, wire staples or nails frequently are 
provided successively arranged and secured in a strip. 
Each strip contains a desired number of staples or nails 
which are adhered together by the coating and enable easy 
insertion of the strip within a magazine of a staple or 
nail gun. The coating holds the fasteners together in a strip 
yet is thin enough to enable insertion of the fasteners 
within the staple or nail gun and allow for separation of 
the individual fasteners from the strip upon firing of the 
gun. Conventionally such coatings typically are composed 
of a nitro-cellulose resin dissolved in an organic solvent 
which is applied to the fasteners. After the solvent is 
evaporated, the coating remains adhered to the fastener. 
During solvent evaporation, the coating can be utilised to  
 
adhere successive fasteners into a strip. An example of 
such a conventional coating and process is illustrated in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,813,985 which describes a process 
comprising the steps of: 
(a) providing a plurality of individual fasteners 
positioned substantially in parallel engagement with each 
other; (b) coating the exterior surfaces of the individual 
fasteners with a coating composed of up to 40% of solids; (c) removing any excess coating from desired portions 
of each fastener; and, (d) curing said coating to adhere said coating to 
said fastener, said curing including heating step. Upon evaporation of the solvent in such coatings, 
however, a

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a coating on the surfaces of a 
plurality of elongate members comprising the steps of: 


(a) providing a plurality of elongate members (12) 
positioned substantially in parallel engagement with each 

other; 
(b) coating the exterior surfaces of each elongate 
member with a coating (26); 
(c) removing any excess coating from desired portions 
of each elongate member (12); and 
(d) curing said coating (26) to adhere said coating 
to said elongate member, said curing including a heating 

step; characterised in that said coating (26) is composed 
of substantially 100% of dry solids; and in that said 

curing step (d) includes a heating and a cooling step that 
are sufficiently rapid to create voids within said coating 

to reduce its shear strength. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein said curing 
of step (d) includes heating to a temperature of between 

293 and 349°C (550° and 650°F) within 1 to 12 seconds and 
cooling provided immediately for 1 to 2 seconds. 
A method as defined in any claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
curing of step (d) includes adhering said elongate members 

(12) together to form a continuous band of parallel 
elongate members. 
A method as defined claim 3, including 
step (e), forming said band of adhered elongate members 

(12) into fastener strips. 
A method as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said coating of step (b) is provided 

electrostatically. 
A method as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, including, before step (b), separating said 

elongate members (12) into pre-determined parallel positions with 
respect to each other and, after step (b), merging said  

 
elongate members (12) together so they are positioned substantially in 

parallel engagement with each other. 
A method as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, including arranging said steps (a) to (c) to 

provide an in line continuous process, providing 
substantially continuous elongate members (12) and continuously moving 

said elongate members between said steps (a) to (c). 
A method as defined in any preceding claim, wherein 
said curing of step (d) includes heating said coated elongate members 

(12) to a pre-determined temperature and subsequent cooling 
and is virtually free of solvent emissions.
