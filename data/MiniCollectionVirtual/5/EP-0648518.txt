<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for shuffling 
playing cards (93), comprising: two shuffling card compartments (16,17) 

which can each be placed in a first position and in a second 
position; a delivery compartment (6); transporting means (59) for 

carrying the playing cards from the shuffling compartment 
located in the first position to the shuffling compartment 

located in the second position; discharge means (68) for carrying 
playing cards from the card compartment located in the first 

position to the delivery compartment; control means for 
normally activating the transporting means and for otherwise 

activating the discharge means as determined by algorithm; 
feed means for feeding the playing cards for shuffling to 

one of the shuffling compartments. 
The shuffling operations to be performed by the 
dealer are time-consuming, which is all the more important 

as the game has to be stopped during shuffling, so that a 
relatively large part of the available playing time at a 

gaming table has to be spent on shuffling, which of course 
has an adverse affect on the obtainable turnover at the 

table. 
In preference the shuffling device comprises means 
for exchanging the position of both shuffling compartments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
shuffling playing cards.Such devices are known, among others from
US-A-5000453.Other card shufflers are described in
US-A-4513969, US-A-4659082 and US-A-4770421.All these machines forming part of the prior art
have very complicated constructions, making them expensive,
prone to breakdown and difficult of access for service and
repair.The object of the present invention is to provide
such a machine of considerably simpler construction, thus
avoiding the drawbacks associated with a complicated
construction.It is further of the greatest importance that the
shuffling process takes place with good quality. This is
after all necessary to avoid cheating at the game by
cardcounting or other techniques used by practiced players.
A good quality of shuffling is moreover conducive to the
fairness of the game.It should be noted herein that an important
application of the card shuffler according to the present
invention lies in the use for the game of "Black Jack". In
this game, mostly played in casinos and similar
establishments, it is important that a stock of shuffled
cards is always available, which cards are taken and brought
into the game by the dealer dependent on the progress of the
game.In the case of manual shuffling a quantity of
cards, for instance six decks, are shuffled by the dealer
before the start of the game, whereafter the game commences.
When a part of the total number of cards in the game has
been dealt by the dealer, the game is stopped, the cards are
collected and reshuffled, whereafter a cutting card is
placed into the stack of shuffled cards by a player and the
game is resumed until the shuffled cards have been used up
to the cutting card. The shuffling operations to be performed by the
dealer are time-consuming, which is all the more important
as the game has to be stopped during shuffling, so that a
relatively large part of the available playing time at a
gaming table has to be spent on shuffling, which of course
has an adverse affect on the obtainable turnover at the
table. The use of a cutting card moreover results in only a
part, usually about half, of the number of available cards
being used.The use of a machine shuffler avoids this
drawback; the shuffler carries out a constant shuffling
process, wherein this is adapted such that there is always a
supply of shuffled cards available to the dealer. The used
cards can be taken up continuously into the shuffling
process, so that the shuffling process can be performed
continuously during play.

two shuffling card compartments (16,17) which can each
be placed in a first position and in a second position,
a delivery compartment (68),
transporting means for carrying the playing cards
from the shuffling card compartment located in the first position

to the shuffling card compartment located in the second position,
discharge means for carrying playing cards from
the shuffling card compartment located in the first position to the

delivery compartment,
control means for normally activating the
transporting means and for otherwise activating the

discharge means as determined by algorithm,
feed means for feeding the playing cards for
shuffling to one of the shuffling card compartments.
Shuffling device as claimed in claim 1,

characterized
 by means (7,8) for exchanging the position of both
shuffling compartments.
Shuffling device as claimed in claim 1 or 2,

characterized in
 that the feed means comprise a feed
compartment for receiving the playing cards for shuffling in

addition to means for carrying playing cards from the feed
compartment to the shuffling card compartment located in the second

position.
Shuffling device as claimed in claim 3,

characterized in
 that the control means are adapted for
activating the feed means simultaneously with the activation

of the discharge means at least for a part of the time of
use.
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing
claims, 
characterized in
 that each of the shuffling card compartments
is formed by four wall elements disposed in a rectangular

pattern and extending substantially vertically, wherein the
distance between mutually opposite wall elements is at least

as large as the dimensions of the playing cards and that in
each of the card compartments a base element is present 

which is movable in substantially vertical direction by
means of a lifting electric motor and a lever transmission

under the control of the control means.
Device as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in

that the control means are adapted for controlling the
lifting electric motors such that the uppermost card present

in the card compartment is situated at a predetermined
level.
Device as claimed in claim 5 or 6,

characterized in
