<CLAIMS>
An impact mill having a grinding path (4) arranged underneath the impact aprons
on the side of the housing (1) facing the material feed inlet, said grinding path at

least partially extending underneath the rotor and connected with the housing rear
wall (5) - which can be swung outwards around an axle (6) provided at its lower

end - in such a way that, as a result of the swinging movement of the rear wall, the
grinding path executes a movement away from the rotor and a pivoting movement

into a flatter position, whereby the grinding path (4) movably rests on a rail or
plate (15) fitted to the housing (1) of the impact mill, 
characterised
 in that its
lower part is pivotably connected via a first linking means (11) to the hinged rear

wall (5) at a point (18) above its pivot axis (6) and its upper part pivotably
connected by means of a second linking means (12) to the hinged rear wall (5) at a

point (19) which is located at a greater distance from the pivot axis.
An impact mill according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the pivot points (25,
26) of linking means (11, 12) on the grinding path (4) are wider apart than the

pivot points (18, 19) of the linking means on the hinged housing rear wall (5), and
that the upper second linking means (12) adopts a more or less horizontal position

when the rear wall (5) is in the closed position.
An impact mill according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the first linking means
(11) is designed as a rod which can be adjusted in length by means of a hydraulic

cylinder piston unit (20).
An impact mill according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the rail or plate (15)
will yield or is freely pivotable downwards following rupture of the pre-set

breaking elements (17).
An impact mill according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the rear face of the
grinding path (4) is provided with two or more ribs (14) running transversely to the

rotor axis (27), said ribs with slightly convex lower edges (13) resting on the rail or
plate (15).
