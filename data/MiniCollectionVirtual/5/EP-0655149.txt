which are interlinked and are equipped with at least one power supply 
and a mains switch (32), 
characterized in that
 an additional control 
unit (20) of the microcomputer is provided which is substantially smaller 

than the computer tower casing and into which the decisive control 
elements, namely the mains switch (32) of the microcomputer and the 

drives, into which interchangeable data carriers can be inserted, are 
transferred, so that these control elements are housed in the control 

unit (20), and in that those parts remain in the computer tower casing, 
which do not need a separate access from outside, so the mainboard

unit (20) houses a maximum of four drives (28, 30). 
Microcomputer according to claim 1, characterized in that the height of 
the control unit (20) is a maximum of 2,5 times the height, and the 

with of the control unit (20) is a maximum of three time the with of 
the corresponding dimensions of a standard 5 1/4 inch drive. 
Microcomputer according to claim 1, characterized in that the control 
unit (20) is interconnected via a single multiple cable (34) with the 

computer casing (22). 
Microcomputer according to claim 1, characterized in that the control 
unit (20) comprises a connector (38) for a headphone. 
Microcomputer according to claim 1, characterized in that the control 
case (20) houses a maximum of four drives (28, 30) with interchangeable 

data carriers.  
 
Microcomputer according to claim 1, characterized in that the control 
unit (20) has feet (46) at its bottom face which are made of bended 

bows open toward the front face of the control unit (20), the dimensions 
being chosen so that a keyboard (24) may be parked between these 

feet (46) and the lower face of the control unit (20). 
Microcomputer according to claim 1, characterized in that a plug connector 
(20) for the keyboard (24), a connector for a mouse and a connector 

(36) for a microphone are provided in the control unit (20).
