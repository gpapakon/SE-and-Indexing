<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for attaching handles (14) by means of holes arranged at their ends (15) on holding pins (62) arranged on an outer wall of containers (56). The handles (14) are transported into a bending station (32), in which their ends (15) are bent downwards and introduced into claws (52). The claws (52) then move the handles (14) into a mounting station (54), to which containers (56) are also supplied, which have hollow holding pins (62) on their opposite sides. In the mounting station (54), a centring pin (68) first moves through the holes in the ends (15) of the handles (14) into a hollow holding pin (62) so that holes and holding pins (62) are centred in relation to one another. Then mounting means in a mounting station (54) are set in operation and push the ends (15) of the handles (14) with the holes onto the holding pins (62). In this position, a transport arrangement in each case transports the containers (56) with the handles (14) into an upsetting station (64), the ends (15) of the handles (14) on the holding pins (62) being secured in each case on the holding pins (62) by a bearing surface (72) bearing from outside. In the upsetting station (64), an upsetting tool (74) is made active, which opens up the ends of the hollow holding pins (62) and thus secures the handles (14) on the holding pins (62). The apparatus thus makes possible completely mechanical mounting of handles (14) made of plastic on containers (56). The apparatus is simple in construction, and works rapidly and reliably fully automatically.

A device for attaching a handle by means of holes arranged
on its ends in retaining lugs arranged on an outer wall of

containers, whereby the device has

a first transport means for the step-wise transportation of
handles (30) made from synthetic material in an elongated form,

into a bending station (32),
means for bending the ends (15) of the handle (14) in the bending
station (32) respectively downwards in a claw (52),
an advancing means for the step-wise advancing of a pair of claws
(52) having a handle (14) held in its ends (15) in a setting-down

station (54),
a second transport means for transportation of containers (56)
having hollow retaining lugs (62) arranged on two opposing sides

in the setting-down station,
a centring means for centring holes on the ends (15) of handle
(14) relative to the retaining lugs (62),
a setting-down means for pushing the ends (15) of the handle (14)
having holes onto retaining lugs (62),
characterised
 by
a compression tool (74) arranged behind the setting-down station
in the transport direction of the second transport means,
a bearing surface (72) arranged between the setting-down station
and the compression station for the ends (15) of the handle (14),

so as to hold the ends (15) in the retaining lugs (62), and
a compression tool (74) arranged in a compression station (64)
for expanding the outer ends of the hollow retaining lugs (62)

so as to secure the ends (15) of the handle (14) in the retaining
lugs (62).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that a
magazine (10) is arranged for the handle (14) in the transport

direction of the first transport means in front of the bending
station (32). 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the

magazine (10) is constructed to incorporate a stack of mats (12)
arranged next to one another and on top of one another, and are

connected with one another by means of rods,
that the floor of magazine (10) is formed by the first transport
means,
that an opening (22) for a mat is constructed in the transport
direction above the first transport means in the magazine (10)
and that a separating station (26) is arranged for separating the
mats (12) into handles (14).
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
first transport means is constructed via a toothed belt (6).
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that a hook
(8) is secured to the toothed belt (6), the height of which is

either identical or smaller than the height of a mat (12) in the
magazine (10).
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that lateral
guides (24) are arranged above the first transport means for the

ends of handle (14).
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that a
locking pawl (25) is arranged in the region of the handle (14)

transport path, which prevents the handle (14) backsliding.
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that
separating station (26) has a separating blade (28), activated

preferably through a pneumatic cylinder. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
bending station (32) has a supporting area (50) for handle (14)

below the handle to be bent, which is essentially in alignment
with the upper edge of the first transport means,


that a vertically moveable clamping slide (46) is arranged above
the supporting area (50), which can be clamped against the

supporting area (50) preferably via a holding-down clamp (48) to
be secured to same,
that a vertically moveable bending slide (34) is provided which
has downwardly directed projections (38) outside the supporting

area (50), which abut against the ends (15) of the handle (14)
to be bent on lowering the bending slide (34), and bend the ends

(15) downwards.
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that
projections (38) have re
spectively spring-loaded pawls (40) which
project inwardly, and which rams against the to-be-bent ends (14)

of handle (14) on lowering the bending slide (34).
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that
projections (38) are adjustable in the direction of handle (14).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
claws (52) have locking pawls (84) for securing the handle (14)

ends (15) held in same.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
means for centring the holes in the handle (14) ends (15)

relative to retaining lugs (62), have preferably pneumatically
actuated centring rods (68), which can be supplied from outside

through holes in the retaining lugs (62), which are arranged
coaxially moveable in preferably pneumatically actuated rams (66)

whereby first the centring rods (68) and then the rams (66) are
actuated. 
A device according to claim 13, characterised in that
compression tool (74) is a part of a compression clamp (86) and

co-operates with a pressure pad (88) and is preferably actuated
by means of a pneumatic cylinder.
