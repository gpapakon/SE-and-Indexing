<ABSTRACT>
A tunable waveguide grating includes a plurality of N waveguides which define 
N optically transmissive pathways. A plurality of (N-1) electrodes are arranged in the 

pathways such that the kth pathway contains (k-1) electrodes, where O 
<
 k 
<
 N. As a 
result of this arrangement, an optical signal propagating through the kth pathway will 

experience a phase shift provided by each of the (k-1) electrodes arranged in that 
pathway. Consequently, in contrast to prior tunable optical gratings, each electrode 

may contribute a phase shift to the portions of the signal propagating through several 
waveguides and hence as the number of waveguides increases no individual electrode 

is required to produce relatively large phase shifts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications systems. More particularly, this
invention relates to tunable optical waveguide gratings used in optical communications
systems.Tunable optical waveguide gratings are employed as dispersive elements in a
wide variety of optical devices such as tunable filters, multiplexers and lasers. For
example, an interconnection apparatus for optical switching, multiplexing, and
demultiplexing is composed of a plurality of closely spaced input waveguides
communicating with the input of a star coupler which functions as a splitter. The
output of the star coupler communicates with a second star coupler via an optical
grating consisting of an array of optical waveguides. Each of the waveguides differ in
length with respect to its nearest neighbor by a predetermined fixed amount. The
outputs of the second star coupler form the outputs of the switching, multiplexing, and
demultiplexing apparatus. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,002,350 issued March 26,
1991.The optical grating located between the two star couplers is essentially
composed of an array of curved waveguides of different lengths. The length of each
waveguide in the grating differs from the lengths of all the other waveguides in the
grating so that, in effect, predetermined and different phase shifts are applied to optical
signals propagating into the waveguides of the grating from the star coupler. This
phase shift occurs because of the different path lengths over which the signals in the
grating must travel to reach the grating output. The output of the waveguides in the
grating thus have different phases, which are functions of the lengths of the
waveguides.The phase shifts applied to the optical signal can be altered by providing each 
waveguide of the optical grating with a suitable electrode controlling the refractive
index of the waveguide. For instance, in a semiconductor device, the current applied to
the electrode may be used to change the carrier concentration, thus causing a change in
the phase of the signal propagating in each waveguide (see, for example, 'Guided-Wave
Optoelectronics", Ed. by T. Tamir, Springer-Verlag, 1988). An optical waveguide
grating having such control electrodes to vary the phase shifts of the signal is referred
to as a tunable waveguide grating.A tunable grating which is composed of a large number of individual
waveguides is difficult to implement because it requires a large total electrode area
which in turn requires a large total tuning current. Specifically, if N is
