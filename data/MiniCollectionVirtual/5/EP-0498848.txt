claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the second shaped 

stones (6), as seen in plan view, are squares. 
A set of shaped stones according to any one of 
claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the spacing 

projections (8) on the second shaped stones (6) project 
to such an extent that, when a second shaped 

stone (6) is located centrally beside a first shaped 
stone (4), the pair of shaped stones can be circumscribed 

by a common outline rectangle touching the 
first shaped stone (4) at the periphery thereof and 

touching the ends of the spacing projections (8). 
A set of shaped stones according to any one of 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the top sides 

(24) of the spacing projections (8) are located at a 
lower level than the useful side (18) of the associated 

shaped stone (6). 
A set of shaped stones according to any one of 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the spacing projections 

(8), on the top side thereof, are parallel to 
the useful side (18) of the associated shaped stone  

 
(6) or are slanted downwardly and outwardly or have 

the configuration of a gable roof. 
A paving element for paving ground areas, 
which - integrally connected by a material bridge - 

comprises at least 

a first partial shaped stone (34) having a larger 
plan view area; and 
a second partial shaped stone (36) having a 
smaller plan view area, 
 
characterized in 


(a) that the paving element (32) provided in the form 
of a shaped stone (32) has on its outer periphery 

integral spacing projections (8) for defining 
wide gaps (50) to adjacent shaped stones (32); 
(b) that the partial shaped stone (34, 36) of one of 
the two kinds of partial shaped stones is free 

from spacing projections (8) on the outer 
periphery; and 
(c) that the spacing projections (8) are provided 
only on the partial shaped stone (34, 36) of the 

other one of the two kinds of partial shaped 
stones. 
A paving element according to claim 9, 
characterized in that the spacing projections (8) are 

provided on the periphery of only the second partial 
shaped stone (36). 
A paving element according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the configuration of the first 

partial shaped stone (34) and the configuration of the 
second partial shaped stone (36) differ from each 

other. 
A paving element according to any one of claims 9 
to 11, characterized in that the first partial shaped  

 
stone (34), as seen in plan view, is an octagon, 

preferably a centrally symmetrical octagon with four 
longer and four shorter sides. 
A paving element according to any one of claims 9 
to 12, characterized in that the second partial shaped 

stone (36), as seen in plan view, is square. 
A paving element according to any one of claims 10

spacing projections (8). 
A paving element according to any one of claims 9 
to 14, characterized in that the material bridge 

(38), as measured in tangential direction related to 
the centre of the second partial shaped stone (36), is 

of less width than the peripheral portions of the 
first and second partial shaped stones (34, 36) facing 

each other, but preferably is of greater width than 

the width of the spacing projections (8).
