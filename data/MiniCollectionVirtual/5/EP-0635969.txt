<ABSTRACT>
Original source verifying data defining a first source verifying image are stored in memory (62). 
The first source verifying image can be produced by a human making marks by hand in a field 

of a form, which can then be provided by a scanner (74) or a facsimile transmission (72) 
through image input circuitry (70). If a second source verifying image is received that is the 

same as the first source verifying image, an operation is performed that would not be 
performed if the images were not the same, such as an operation accessing a related item of 

data. For example, the first source verifying image can be received with a document image, 
and data defining the document image and the original source verifying data can be stored so 

that a source verifying image that is the same as the first source verifying image must be 
received before an operation can access the document data and provide it to image output 

circuitry for printing or facsimile transmission. As a result, the marked form is analogous to a 
key: Only someone who possesses the marked form or a high quality copy can obtain access to 

the document data. If the marked form is lost or destroyed, the document data cannot be 
accessed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for verifying the source of a signal, such
as a signal requesting an operation.Using PaperWorks™ on a PC., Xerox Corporation, 1992, pp. 1-4 and 71-121
describes
features of PaperWorks™ software. Page 2 indicates that the software stores a document as an
electronic image and that a document from a personal computer (PC) can be delivered to a fax
machine, whether a document faxed to the PC or a version of a document created on the PC.
Page 3 indicates that a user can set a security code and require that it be entered on forms for
PaperWorks to process them.Using PaperWorks™ from a Fax Machine., Xerox Corporation, 1992, also describes
features of the PaperWorks™ software. Pages 1 and 4 indicate that information on a PC is
secure because one's version of PaperWorks works only with forms created on one's PC;
PaperWorks prints a special code on each form so that a document on one's PC can only be
accessed with a form from one's PC. Also, for complete security, one can establish a security
code to prevent unauthorized use of PaperWorks; that code must be marked on a form before
PaperWorks will process it.One aspect of the invention is based on the observation of problems with
conventional source verification techniques for data processing systems. Conventionally, a
data processing system verifies the source of a signal using a source verifier that includes a set
of ASCII codes or other character codes, such as a password.Conventional techniques for providing ASCII codes or other character codes to a data
processing system can be problematic in certain situations. If the codes are obtained directly,
such as by pressing keys of a keyboard, the system must have user input circuitry for receiving
such codes; in this case, a remote user able to communicate only through a facsimile machine,
for example, would have difficulty providing a source verifier. On the other hand, if the codes
are obtained indirectly through handprint recognition or other recognition techniques, errors
in recognition may make it difficult to provide a source verifier accurately. Such errors could
occur because of inadequate recognition software or because of inadequate resolution of the
facsimile transmission.Even if a user is able to provide a set of ASCII codes or other character codes as a
source verifier, the level of certainty that can be obtained with such codes is limited. It is
possible for unauthorized users to observe or discover the set of codes and use them to obtain
unauthorized

A machine for performing source verification so as to determine whether
an operation requested by a user may be performed, comprising:


means (70, 394, 454) for providing original source verifying data (92, 424)

a memory device (68, 420, 490) for storing said original source verifying
data (92, 424);
means (70, 394, 454) for providing image set data defining an image

which is verified with respect to its similarity with the original source
verifying image;
means (66, 382, 470) for comparing the original source verifying data
stored in said memory device (68, 420, 490) with the image set data to

obtain a similarity measure data which indicates a measure of similarity
