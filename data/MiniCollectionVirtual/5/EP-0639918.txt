<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to CATV systems generally
and more particularly to CATV systems which provide additional
services to subscribers.Existing CATV systems employ radio-frequency (RF)
links, such as cable and satellite links, or optical links using
fiber-optic cables for transmission of TV program material. CATV
systems which provide transmissions only from a headend to a
plurality of subscribers are called one-way systems. CATV systems
which additionally involve transmissions from subscribers' units
are called two-way systems.Some of the one-way systems also employ a telephone
link for transmission of management data to the subscribers,
while others transmit the management data via the RF or optical
links.Current two-way CATV systems transmit TV and audio
programs via cable or satellite and receive data from subscriber
units via telephone links. The data received is mainly CATV
subscriber viewing data, subscriber program ratings and the like.In order to enable telephonic communications, the
available CATV converters incorporate modem units which are
directly coupled to existing telephone links.Descriptions of prior art telephonic transponders which
are also suitable for CATV systems may be found in several 
patents. For example, U.S. Patent 3,922,492 to Lumsden describes
a remote meter reading transponder which includes a modem. U.S.
Patent 3,868,640 to Binnie et al. describes a system for
interrogating remote stations via an automatic dialer.Neither the existing one-way CATV systems nor the two-way
systems available today are used to provide services to
subscribers. Although existing two-way systems employ telephonic
modems, they are mainly used for communication management and for
subscriber viewing data readout. Today, telephonic communication
via a modem is mostly done at low data rates and for short
periods over long intervals, thus leaving the telephonic modems
unexploited for long periods.In an article named "An Evolutionary Approach to the
Development of Two-Way Cable Technology Communication" by J.B.
Wright, M. P. Block and D.S. McVoy in IEEE Transactions on Cable
Television, Vol. CATV-2, No. 1, January 1977, mention is made of
proposed two-way CATV systems in which electronic automated
newspaper, second class mail and on demand catalogs will be
distributed to subscribers. The present invention seeks to provide CATV systems having significant
additional applications such as facsimile, electronic-mail (E-mail), voice-mail and
mail. The term "CATV" is used throughout the specification
