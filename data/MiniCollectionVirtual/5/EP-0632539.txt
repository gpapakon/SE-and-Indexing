<ABSTRACT>
A plug-in power supply unit is described for supplying electricity to electrical devices, especially mobile devices, consisting of a housing (1) which is provided with a mains plug and a printed circuit board (6) which is fitted with the electronic components used for the electrical power supply. In order to enable simple conversion to different mains plug types, an adaptor plug (17) is provided, which can be mounted replaceably on the housing (1) and whose plug pins (19, 21) are constructed in accordance with any desired national standard and are each connected to a contact spring (20), which contact springs (20) come into contact with corresponding contact surfaces (8), which are arranged in the plug housing (1), of a printed circuit board (6). The housing (1) is provided with a step-shaped depression into which a tongue, which is provided with the contact surfaces (8), of an electronic printed circuit board (6) projects, the adaptor plug (17) being provided with an adaptor housing which fits into the depression (2), and, in the assembled state, its contact springs (20) resting against the contact surfaces (8) of the printed circuit board (6). A closure cover, which fits into the depression (2) in the housing (1), is also associated therewith.
