<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane 
(HFC-236fa) as a refrigerant, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectric, sterilant 
carrier, polymerization media, particulate removal fluid, carrier fluid, buffing 
abrasive agent, displacement drying agent, and as a power cycle working fluid. 
More particularly, it relates to 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane as a highly effective 
and potentially environmentally safe refrigerant for use in refrigeration equipment 
utilizing centrifugal compression. Mechanical refrigeration is primarily an application of 
thermodynamics wherein a cooling medium, such as a refrigerant, goes through a 
cycle so that it can be recovered for reuse. Commonly used cycles include vapor-compression, 
absorption, steam-jet or steam-ejector, and air. There are various types of compressors that may be used in 
refrigeration applications. Compressors can be generally classified as reciprocating, 
rotary, jet, centrifugal, or axial-flow, depending on the mechanical means to 
compress the fluid, or as positive-displacement or dynamic, depending on how the 
mechanical elements act on the fluid to be compressed. A centrifugal compressor uses rotating elements to accelerate the 
refrigerant radially, and typically includes an impeller and diffuser housed in a 
casing. Centrifugal compressors usually take fluid in at an impeller eye, or central 
inlet of a circulating impeller, and accelerate it radially outwardly. Some static 
pressure rise occurs in the impeller, but most of the pressure rise occurs in the 
diffuser section of the casing, where velocity is converted to static pressure. Each 
impeller-diffuser set is a stage of the compressor. Centrifugal compressors are built 
with from 1 to 12 or more stages, depending on the final pressure desired and the 
volume of refrigerant to be handled. The pressure ratio, or compression ratio, of a compressor is the ratio 
of absolute discharge pressure to the absolute inlet pressure. Pressure delivered by a  
 
centrifugal compressor is practically constant over a relatively wide range of 
capacities. Unlike a positive displacement compressor, a centrifugal compressor 
depends entirely on the centrifugal force of the high speed impeller to compress 
the vapor passing through the impeller. There is no positive displacement, but 
rather what is called dynamic-compression. The pressure a centrifugal compressor can develop depends on the tip 
speed of the impeller. Tip speed is the speed of the impeller measured at its tip 
and is

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing refrigeration comprising providing a 
centrifugal compressor designed to use trichlorofluoromethane, 1,2,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane 

or 1,2-dichloro-tetrafluoroethane as a refrigerant, compressing the 
refrigerant in the centrifugal compressor, and evaporating the refrigerant in the 

vicinity of a body to be cooled, characterised in that the refrigerant used in the 
centrifugal compressor is 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane.
