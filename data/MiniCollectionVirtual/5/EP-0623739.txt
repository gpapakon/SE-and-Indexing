<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a manifold (double manifold 1) for internal combustion engines with a tubular body (2, 3) produced by a metal forming process. Its open end can be connected to apertures (4 to 7) of a flange (8) on the engine-side. The wall of the tubular body has a collecting aperture, which faces a flange (11) on the exhaust side. In order to increase the fatigue strength of manifolds of this type, it is proposed to manufacture their tubular bodies (2, 3) in one part with different wall thickness by means of internal high pressure metal forming. At the same time, a pipe union leading from the collecting aperture to the aperture of the flange (9, 10) on the exhaust side is directly formed on.

Manifold (1) for internal combustion engines having a tubular body (2, 3) 
manufactured by a non-cutting shaping process, the open ends (2.1, 2.2 and 

3.1, 3.2) of the said tubular body being designed for connection to the 
orifices (4 to 7) of a motor-side flange (8) and the peripheral wall of said 

tubular body comprising at least one collector orifice towards the exhaust-side 
flange (11), characterised in that the tubular body (2,3) is manufactured 

as one piece having different wall thicknesses by means of an internal high 
pressure non-cutting shaping process and comprises at the collector orifice 

a connecting piece (2.3 and 3.3) formed as a unitary construction for 
connection to an orifice (9 and 10) of the exhaust-side flange (11). 
Manifold according to claim 1, characterised in that the walls of the tubular 
body (2, 3) towards the flanges (8, 11) have a greater thickness. 
Manifold according to claim 1, characterised in that a somewhat elliptic 
cross-section towards the collector orifice is provided on the tubular bodies 

(2,3) starting from the circular cross-sections in the region of the motor-side 
flange (8), wherein the smaller of the elliptic axes is somewhat perpendicular 

to the bend axis of the tubular body (2, 3). 
Manifold according to claim 1, characterised in that disposed between the 
connecting pieces (2.3 and 3.3) formed as a unitary construction with the 

tubular body (2 or 3) and the orifice (9 and 10) of the exhaust-side flange 
(11) is a tulip sheet (12 or 13) which is connected in a frictionally engaged 

manner to the flange (11) or the tubular body (2 and 3). 
Method of manufacturing a manifold according to claim 1, characterised by 
the method steps:  

 

a) Pre-bend or pre-crease a tubular blank, 
b) Heat the tubular blank to a low-stress annealed state, 
c) Place the tubular blank heated according to b) in a sinking of a tool 
(14) of an internal high pressure non-cutting shaping machine, 
d) Act upon the pre-bent tubular blank with hydraulic internal high 
pressure, 
e) Remove the partly or completely reshaped manifold. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that for the purpose of 
reshaping the connecting piece the already partly finished blank is reheated 

to produce a low-voltage annealed state and subsequently formed to the 
finished dimensions. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the pressure exerted on 
the connecting piece is varied periodically by means of an electronic 

controlled pressure piston.
