<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic closure cap, with a cover plate 2, on whose underside 4 there are arranged a plurality of spring fingers 3 which in each case at a distance from the underside of the cover plate 2 have a latching region 5, which reaches behind a carrier opening. Each spring finger comprises two elastic webs 6, 7, between which there is arranged a latching element 8, likewise designed as an elastic web, the latching element 8 being configured in the shape of a hook and having a connection region 9, which is at an angle with respect to the elastic webs 6, 7, and the adjoining, angled latching region 5.

<CLAIMS>
Plastic closure cap, with a cover plate, on the 
underside of which are arranged several spring fingers 

which each have, at a distance from the underside of the 
cover plate, a catch region which engages behind a 

carrier orifice, characterized in that each spring finger 
(3) consists of two elastic webs (6, 7), between which a 

catch element (8), likewise designed as an elastic web, 
is arranged, and in that the catch element (8) is 

designed to be hook-shaped, with a junction region (9) 
standing at an angle to the elastic webs (6, 7) and with 

the angled catch region (5) adjoining said junction 
region. 
Closure cap according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the catch region (5) extends at a distance 

parallel to the adjacent webs (6, 7). 
Closure cap according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the junction region (9) of each spring 

finger (3) is arranged at an acute angle to the longitudinal 
axis (L-L) of the cover plate (2). 
Closure cap according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the webs (6, 7) extend axis-parallel to 

the longitudinal axis (L-L) of the cover plate (2). 
Closure cap according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the spring fingers (3) are arranged 

at a distance from the outer circumference on the underside 
of the cover plate (2), and in that a sealing 

element (10) is arranged between the outer circumference 
and the spring fingers (3). 
Closure cap according to Claim 4, characterized  
 

in that the sealing element (10) consists of a heat-deformable 
material. 
Closure cap according to Claims 5 and 6, characterized 
in that the sealing element (10) is embedded in 

a groove (11) arranged on the underside of the cover 
plate (2). 
Closure cap according to one of the preceding 
claims, with a rounded cover plate, characterized in that 

the cross-section of the webs (6, 7) of the spring 
fingers (3) and/or the shape of the groove (11) are 

matched to the rounding of the cover plate (2). 
Closure cap according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that several spring fingers (3) 

are formed on the underside (4) of the cover plate (2) in 
a manner distributed over the circumference. 
Closure cap according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cover plate (2) has a 

peripheral rim (12) on the underside (4) in the inner 
region of the spring fingers (3). 
Closure cap according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the rim (12) is provided with stiffening ribs 

(13).
