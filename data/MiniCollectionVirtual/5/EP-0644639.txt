<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
automatic waterproofing apparatus for a joint of electric 
wires and more particularly, to an automatic waterproofing 
apparatus for automatically waterproofing a joint of electric 
wires in a wiring harness used for wiring of a motor 
vehicle, a motor bicycle, a ship, etc. Various structures for waterproofing a joint of 
electric wires have been proposed so far. For example, in 
one known structure for waterproofing a joint of electric 
wires, an insulating tape is wound around the joint. 
Meanwhile, in another known structure, a butyl rubber sheet 
or a butyl rubber tape is wound around the joint of the 
electric wires and then, external force is applied to the 
wound sheet or tape. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication No. 2-257579 (1990) proposes a waterproof 
structure in which, when conductors 3 exposed from 
insulating coatings 1 of electric wires 2A and 2B, respectively 
are connected to each other so as to form a joint 4, 
the joint 4 is covered by an insulating cover 5 and then, 
urethane elastomer is filled into the insulating cover 5. 
Furthermore, a waterproof structure in which, after a joint 
of electric wires has been covered by a container formed by 
vacuum forming or an insulating sheet, silicone resin or 
ultraviolet-curing resin is injected into the container or  
 
the insulating sheet, is known from Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. 4-229961 (1992), Japanese Utility 
Model Laid-Open Publication No. 64-55670 (1989) or Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1-154473 (1989). However, the above mentioned known waterproof 
structures have the following drawbacks. Initially, in 
case the insulating tape is wound around the joint of the 
electric wires, it is difficult to wind the insulating tape 
around the joint of the electric wires closely without 
producing a gap between the insulating tape and the joint, 
thereby resulting in a possibility of incomplete waterproofing. 
Meanwhile, in case the butyl sheet or the like 
is wound around the joint of the electric wires and then, 
external force is applied to the butyl sheet, the butyl 
sheet cannot follow a bent portion of the wire properly, so 
that the butyl sheet is not brought into close contact with 
the joint, thus resulting in a risk of incomplete waterproofing. 
Furthermore, in case the joint of the electric 
wires is disposed in the insulating cover or the like and 
then, urethane elastomer is filled into the insulating 
cover, the
