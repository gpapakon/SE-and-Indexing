<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
cartridge, and an electrophotographic image forming apparatus to which the
process cartridge is detachably mountable.The image forming apparatus includes a laser
beam printer, LED printer, an electrophotographic
copying machine, facsimile machine, word processor or
the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a
printer, a uniformly charged photosensitive drum is
selectively exposed to light so that a latent image is
formed thereon. The latent image is visualized by
toner into a toner image, which, in turn, is
transferred onto a recording material. Maintenance
operations of such an apparatus are performed only by
expert service man with the result of inconveniences
of the users.To avoid the inconveniences, a photosensitive
drum, a charger, a developing device, a cleaning
device or the like are integrated as a cartridge. By
exchanging the cartridge by the users, the toner
replenishment and the parts such as photosensitive
drum having reached the end of their service lives are exchanged, 
thus permitting easy maintenance (process cartridge).
The process cartridge is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.
3,985,436, 4,500,195, 4,540,268 and 4,627,701 and so
on.In such a process cartridge, a shutter
mechanism for covering an exposed part of the
photosensitive drum is used for the purpose of
preventing deterioration of the photosensitive drum
when the process cartridge is taken out, in some
examples of the process cartridges, as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,462,677. The shutter mechanism
automatically opens by engagement between a cam of the
shutter mechanism and a cam of the main assembly of
the image forming apparatus, and when the process
cartridge is taken out of the main assembly, the
shutter mechanism automatically closes by urging force
of a spring or the like. Therefore, said shutter
mechanism is always urged in a closing direction by
spring or the like.
A similar process cartridge according to the preamble
of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A- 5 083 158.A longitudinal end of a photosensitive drum
in the process cartridge is provided with a flange
gear for receiving a driving force from driving means
of the main assembly to rotate the drum.The process cartridge is mounted to the main
assembly in the following manner. A holder portion
rotatably mounted to the main assembly and for holding
the cartridge, is opened. The process cartridge is 
pushed in along a guide of the holder portion.
Thereafter, the holder portion is closed. U.S. Patent
No. 4,873,548 discloses a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process cartridge (B) detachably mountable
relative to a main assembly (1) of an electrophotographic

image forming apparatus (A), the process cartridge
comprising:


an electrophotographic photosensitive member (9);
process means (10,12,13) actable on said
electrophotographic photosensitive member;
a shutter portion (24c) adapted to protect an image
transfer region of said photosensitive member (9) from

which a toner image is in operation transferred from said
photosensitive member to a recording material;
a supporting member (24a, 24b) supporting said
shutter portion (24c) for movement between a protecting

position in which it protects said region and a retracted
position away from said protecting position;
an elastic means (24f) adapted to bias said
supporting member so as to urge said shutter portion

(24c) toward said protecting position; and
a pair of projections (24a4) provided at respective
end portions of said supporting member (24a, 24b)

adjacent longitudinally opposite ends of the cartridge
and arranged to receive a force moving said shutter

portion (24c) toward said retracted position against the
elastic force of said elastic means (24f) when said

process cartridge (B) is mounted in the main assembly of
said electrophotographic image forming apparatus;
 
   
characterised in that
