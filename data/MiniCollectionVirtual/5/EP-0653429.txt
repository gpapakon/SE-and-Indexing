<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to new silanes and their use for silylation of dielectric materials and for the anchoring of biologically active compounds. The silanes possess the general formula I  (R

)Si-Y-X      I where R

 are alkyl, alkoxy or halogen, but at leat one of these radicals is either alkoxy or halogen and where Y is an alkylene chain [-CH2-(CH2)n-CH2-] or a fluoroalkylene chain [-CH2-(CF2)n-CH 2-]
, [-CH2-(CF2)n-CF2-] where n = 1-20 or an oligooxyalkylene chain -[(CH2)n'-O-(CH2)n'']
m- where n', n'' = 2-6 and m = 2-6, with the silanes being characterised in that the group X is an epoxide, an anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid having 4-5 carbon atoms, an isothiocyanate, an arylcarboxylic acid chloride or arylsulphonic acid chloride, but with the proviso that if the group X is an epoxide, at least one of the radicals R

 is a halogen. The new silanes of the invention have the following advantages: The reactive groups X of the silanes are stable to hydrolysis but sufficiently reactive for the immobilisation of a biologically active molecule can be carried out directly without a further activation step on the silane layer. The silanes are suitable for the direct coating of dielectric materials, specifically of dielectric waveguides which preferably comprise ZrO2, HfO2, Ta2O5, SiO2Al2O3 or TiO2. The silanes can be applied to the surface of dielectric materials either from solution or from the gas phase. The stability to hydrolysis of the reactive groups gives an improved shelf life of the silane layers and allows their use directly in an aqueous medium.
