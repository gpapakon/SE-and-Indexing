<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide color 
light-sensitive material, particularly to a high-sensitive 
silver halide color light-sensitive material improved in 
storage stability and a photographing unit package thereof. ISO-100 films, which have been dominant in the market of 
silver halide color light-sensitive materials for popular 
uses, are being replaced in recent years by high-sensitive 
films of ISO-320 or more which have advantages of causing 
fewer photographing failures and providing high image 
qualities. Being highly sensitive, these films not only make 
it possible to use a high-speed shutter which can minimize the 
influence of movement of the hands in taking a picture and 
catch a subject moving quickly, but also make it possible to 
take a picture even in a dimly-lit place and further make it  
 
easy to adjust the focus by allowing an iris diaphragm to be 
considerably stopped down; as a result, failure in taking a 
picture can be prevented. Moreover, the image quality of 
these high-sensitive films is improved to the level as high as 
that of conventional ISO-100 films. These are the reasons why 
a simple photographing system like a photographing unit (or a 
film with lens) has been realized and accepted widely. However, films having an ISO speed of 320 or more are 
high in coating weight of silver and thereby impose a heavy 
load on processing laboratories which are making endeavors to 
shorten the processing time and improve the efficiency of 
development; therefore, improvement of the situation is 
demanded. In addition, a large coating weight of silver 
inevitably increases the thickness of a light-sensitive 
material and eventually places a limit in improvement of image 
quality, such as sharpness, and storage stability. Since high-sensitive films of ISO-320 or more use a high-sensitive 
silver halide emulsion, these films have a drawback 
of allowing colloidal silver particles used in a light-absorbing 
layer or an antihalation layer to cause undesirable 
contact fogs and, moreover, such colloidal silver brings about 
another drawback of lowering the desilverizing speed in the 
desilverizing process during development treatment. Though 
use of an organic dye is proposed as a substitute for the 
colloidal silver, this method is not effective and liable to 
produce undesirable results such as unnecessary residual  
 
absorptions due to poor decoloring property as well as 
lowering of filtering effect due to diffusion of the dye to 
other layers. Further, use of a
