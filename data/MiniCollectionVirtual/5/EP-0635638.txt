<ABSTRACT>
Circuit for flame detection for a transistor coil ignition of a burner. The transistor coil ignition has a driving stage which drives a power transistor (Tr2) located in the circuit of the primary winding of an ignition coil (ZS) in order to charge the primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS) with a charge current from a power supply. A switching device (ZG1, S1) is provided with an ignition and flame detection device which in the flame detection position limits the charge current flowing across the primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS) to a level which lies below that which is necessary to produce an ignition spark in the ignition position so that without a flame an ignition flashover cannot take place. An evaluation circuit (Glr1, R3, C2, K2) evaluates the signal, occurring after the disconnection of the charge current flowing across the primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS), from the primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS), this signal having pulse peaks when the flame is absent and no such pulse peaks when the flame is present. The evaluation takes place preferably at a display signal which is present at a display device (A1) in order to display the presence and absence of a flame in the burner.

Circuit arrangement for flame detection for a transistor
coil ignition system of a burner, having a control stage

which disables a power transistor lying in the electric
circuit of the primary winding of an ignition coil when a

specific current level is reached in the electric circuit of
the primary winding, the secondary winding being positioned

across a spark gap and the specific current level being so
selected that the voltage induced in the secondary winding

when the power transistor is disabled triggers ignition
sparking across the spark gap, characterised by


a switching device (S1, ZG1; RG1) in the control stage
(K1, FF1, Tr1a, Tr1b), which switching device, in the flame

detection phase, reduces, in the electric circuit of the
primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS), the current level

at which the power transistor (Tr2) is disabled to a value
at which the voltage then induced in the secondary winding

of the ignition coil (ZS) leads to spark-over at the spark
gap (FS) only when a flame is present, and
an evaluation circuit (Glr1, R3, C2, K2) at which the
signal occurring across the primary winding of the ignition

coil (ZS) after the power transistor (Tr2) has been disabled
is present and which evaluates that signal for the presence

or absence of a flame in the burner and converts it into a
corresponding output signal.
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, characterised
in that the switching device (ZG1, S1) comprises a timer

(ZG1) and a switch (S1) operated by the timer (ZG1), which
switch (S1), depending on the switch position, applies the

current level value for flame detection or for ignition to 
one input of a comparator (K1) in the control stage of the

transistor coil ignition system, at the other input of which
comparator (K1) lies the current level value of a current

sensor (R2) in the electric circuit of the primary winding
of the ignition coil (ZS).
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, characterised
in that the switching device (RG1) comprises a ramp generator

supplying an output voltage which increases in a linear
manner and which is present at the input of a comparator

(K1) in the control stage of the transistor coil ignition
system, at the other input of which comparator (K1) lies the

current level value of a current sensor (R2) in the electric
circuit of the primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS),

that current level value of the current sensor (R2) together
with the display signal of the evaluation circuit (Glr1, R3,

C2, K2) being present at a signal processing circuit (A1)
which supplies a display corresponding to the display signal

and processes the input signals into a measure of the speed
of the flame and/or the speed of the combustion gas mixture.
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the evaluation circuit (Glr1, R3, C2,

K2) has a further comparator (K2) which compares a signal
from the primary winding of the ignition coil (ZS), which

signal has been integrated by means of a rectifier (Glr1)
and an integration member (R3, C2), with a reference value

and emits a signal corresponding to the comparison.
Circuit arrangement according to claim 4, characterised
in that the output signal of the further comparator (K2) is

present at a display device (A1). 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 4, characterised
by an ignition diagnosis device (ZÃ¼D1) of which the output

signal is present at the display device (A1).
