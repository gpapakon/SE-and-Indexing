<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carrier for 
electrophotography. This invention also relates to a 
two-component type developer for developing 
electrostatic images that comprises the carrier and a 
toner. In general, in electrostatic recording systems 
making use of electrophotography, commonly employed is 
a method in which a photoconductive material such as 
selenium, OPC (organic photoconductive material) or α-Si 
is used in a photosensitive member, where the 
photosensitive member is uniformly charged by various 
means, thereafter the charged surface of the 
photosensitive member is irradiated with a light image 
to form on its surface an electrostatic latent image 
corresponding to the light image, and the latent image 
is converted to a visible image by causing toner to 
adhere thereto by magnetic brush development or other 
developing process. This developing method makes use of a toner 
that converts the electrostatic latent image to a  
 
visible image and carrier particles comprising a 
magnetic material. The carrier particles provide a 
proper quantity of positive or negative electrostatic 
charges to the toner by triboelectric charging, and 
also carry the toner on the carrier particle surfaces 
by the electrostatic attraction force of the 
triboelectric charges. The two-component type developer having such a 
toner and a carrier is coated on a developing sleeve 
provided with a magnet in its inside, in a given layer 
thickness by means of a developer layer thickness 
control member, and then transported to a developing 
zone formed between the photosensitive member 
described above and the developing sleeve. A given development bias voltage is applied 
across the photosensitive member and the developing 
sleeve. The toner is fed to the developing zone and 
transferred onto the photosensitive member. There are various performances required in 
carriers. Particularly important performances are 
proper triboelectric charge-providing properties, 
breakdown strength against applied electric fields, 
impact resistance, wear resistance, anti-spent 
properties, developing performance and productivity. For example, long-term use of the two-component 
type developer causes toner filming in which  
 
the toner that contributes no development (i.e, spent 
toner) melt-adheres to the surface of carrier 
particles, which consequently causes a deterioration 
of the two-component type developer and also causes a 
deterioration of image quality of developed images 
that is accompanied with it. An excessively
