<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided to increase the fiber content of extruded foods without compromising overall 
eating quality. It has been recognized that dietary fiber is beneficial in human diet; however, it has been 

difficult to obtain good or acceptable texture in extruded foods fortified with high fiber because the addition 
of dietary fiber to these foods adds density. It has now been found that the addition of resistant starch to 

starting dough mixes for extruded food products not only increases the total dietary fiber of the extruded 
food product, but also increases expansion and improves the texture of the extruded food over compositions 

that do not contain the resistant starch and over compositions that are fortified with other forms of dietary 
fiber, such as oat bran.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a method for increasing the expansion or improving the texture of food products 
that are prepared by extrusion cooking techniques and that are fortified with dietary fiber. Cereals constitute a major part of the human diet and are an important source of starch and dietary 
fiber. In the preparation of cereals for human consumption high temperature-short time extrusion cooking 
is widely used. The food products prepared by extrusion techniques are typically ready-to-eat cereal and 
snack foods, crisp breads, pasta and noodles. Research literature has indicated that the inclusion of fiber 
into human diets is beneficial, and as a result, there have been attempts to fortify extruded foods with dietary 
fiber. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to make a satisfactory food product that has high fiber content 
through extrusion techniques. The quality attributes of extruded food products pertain mainly to their texture and crispness, which 
in turn relate to their expanded volume and bulk density. It is known that extrusion processing variables, 
such as, barrel temperature, screw configurations, nozzle size and shape, screw speed, and moisture 
content prior to thermal processing, can influence the expansion volume of the extruded product. The 
protein, lipid, and starch content of the raw materials for making the dough mix also affect the texture and 
expansion volume of extruded foods. In United States patents 5,169,662 and 5,176,936, it is disclosed that products with significant 
amounts of dietary fiber are difficult to expand. As just stated, sufficient expansion is critical in certain 
extruded foods because the crispness and texture of the foods is related to their expanded volume and bulk 
density. It is also difficult to obtain good or acceptable texture in flaked products or in pasta and noodles 
when those products are fortified with high fiber because the addition of dietary fiber adds density and 
reduces favorable texture and overall eating quality.  
 EP-A-0 512 249 discloses a method for preparing a dry extruded food, comprising 
the steps of formulating a food for extrusion, said food comprising 1-15% water and 
an affective amount, up to 75% by weight, of a selected solubulized high amylose 
starch; and extruding the food at a temperature of up to 160°C and a pressure of up 
to 35.2 kg/cm2, wherein the dry, extruded food is characterized by a crisp texture 
and by resistance to migration of water, oil and air into and out of the food. US-A-5 024 996 discloses

A method for preparing extruded food products comprising providing an 
uncooked cereal dough mix, adding sufficient water to the cereal dough mix to attain 

a moisture content of 14-22% by weight, processing the cereal dough in an extruder 
having an exit die of a predetermined shape and size at sufficient temperature and 

pressure to yield an expanded dough extrudate, and drying the extruded dough to a 
final moisture content of less than about 3%,

uncooked cereal dough mix, up to 45%, by weight of the uncooked dough mix, of a 

starch resistant to amylase digestion (resistant starch).
