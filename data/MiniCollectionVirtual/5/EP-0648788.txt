<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a polychloroprene latex useful as an adhesive.
More particularly, it relates to a method for producing a
polychloroprene latex. Such a method in known from EP-0 516 360.Heretofore, adhesives using polychloroprene as the
base material were mainly of a solvent type. However, in
recent years, solvent type adhesives have been disfavored
in view of such problems as the toxicity, the danger of
fire and the environmental pollution by the organic
solvents during their production or use, and demand for
non-solvent type adhesives has been increasing.A polychloroprene latex adhesive has good adhesive
properties and is free from the above problems, since it
requires no organic solvent such as toluene or hexane
during its production. Accordingly, it is expected to be
a substitute for conventional solvent-type adhesives. Such a polychloroprene latex adhesive is coated on
both objects to be bonded, and the resulting adhesive
layers will then be substantially dried and then bonded
to each other, whereby it provides a high initial
adhesive strength immediately after the bonding.By virtue of such a feature, the adhesive of this
type is practically used as an aqueous contact-adhesive.
As the range of its application expands, improvement of
the adhesive properties such as the contact property and
water resistance has been increasingly demanded.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 22047/1975
and EP 0451998 A2 disclose latexes obtained by
polymerizing chloroprene and an unsaturated carboxylic
acid in the presence of a polyvinyl alcohol. However,
latexes prepared in accordance with Examples given in
these publications, are not necessarily satisfactory with
respect to their water resistant adhesive strength.The water resistance of the product bonded by a latex
adhesive usually decreases by the presence of a
hydrophilic material such as an emulsifier contained in
the latex. In the above case, it is known that the
decrease of the water resistance can be controlled by
reducing the amount of the polyvinyl alcohol incorporated
during the production of the latex. However, in the
above-mentioned method, it tends to be difficult to
produce a stable latex if the amount of polyvinyl alcohol
is reduced, and it has been difficult to obtain a latex 
satisfying both the stability and the water resistance.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method
for producing a polychloroprene latex which is excellent
in terms of contact property (initial adhesive strength) and
