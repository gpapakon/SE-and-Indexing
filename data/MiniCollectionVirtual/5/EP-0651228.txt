<ABSTRACT>
Armour module of the type comprising a casing (1) surrounding a stack of armour elements, this module being intended for protecting a vulnerable structure, characterised in that it includes a set of spacers (7, 15) applied on each internal face of the casing (1) in order to define a free space, between the stack and the casing, receiving an injectable or pourable wedging material (13) which can be polymerised in situ. The invention applies, for example, to the protection of vehicles, boats, aircraft and stationary structures.

A shielding module of the type comprising an 
envelope (1) surrounding a stack of shielding elements 

designed to protect a vulnerable structure, characterized 
in that it comprises a set of wedges (7, 15) applied to 

each internal face of the envelope (1) to delimit a free 
space between the stack and the envelope to receive an 

injectable or castable wedging material that can be 
polymerized in situ. 
A shielding module according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the wedging material (13) is a 

polyurethane resin. 
A shielding module according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the wedging material (13) is at 

least 0.5 mm thick. 
A shielding module according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the stack is formed of four 

elements (8-11), in the form of plates, made from among 
the following materials: glass, rubber, metal, organic 

material, ceramic, etc. 
A shielding module according to one of the above 
Claims, characterized in that a layer of foam (19) is 

placed between two consecutive plates (17,18). 
A shielding module according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the layer of foam has a density of 

between 0.05 and 0.20. 
A shielding module according to one of the above 
Claims, characterized in that the envelope (1) is formed 

of a casing (2) inside which the stack is placed and a lid 
(3) attached to the casing, by welding for example. 
A shielding module according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the envelope (1) is formed of 

a set of plates applied to the corresponding faces of the 
stack, attached to each other, by welding for example. 
A shielding module according to any one of the 
above Claims, characterized in that the envelope (1) has 

injection holes (12) and vents (14).  
 
A shielding module according to any one of Claims 
1 to 9, characterized in that it has an envelope (1) with 

a rectangular, T-shaped, Z-shaped, trapezoidal, or crown-shaped 
section.
