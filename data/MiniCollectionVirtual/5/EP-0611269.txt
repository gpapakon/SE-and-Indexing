<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a sewage pump station (1) with submersible 
pumps (8) to be lowered and raised along guides (15). 
In order to decrease the risk that the connection parts of the pumps 
(8) should disturb the flow within the pump station (1), the bottom 

(3) of the 
latter is designed with a slope (7) having a recess which accommodates 

said parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a pump station for municipal sewage water, 
which pump station includes one or several submersible pumps. A pump station of this type is provided with one or several inlets 
for sewage water and normally one outlet pipe connected to the pump 
outlets. An example is shown in the Swedish Patent No 366 013. The submersible pump unit is normally lowered into the water along 
guides so arranged that the pump unit in its lowered position with 
its outlet makes contact with the outlet pipe from the station. The 
pump unit must then seal against the outlet pipe without any bolt 
attachment or the like. For this purpose a so-called connection 
support is arranged at the bottom of the station and provided with 
a pipe part attached to the outlet pipe and having a flange against 
which a corresponding flange on the pump outlet makes contact. Normally 
the lower parts of the guides are attached to the connection 
support. The sewage water contains a lot of solid bodies such as sludge which 
is easily assembled on the tank bottom as sludge banks, rags and 
other elongated objects which may be wound around the pump unit and 
its connection parts. Sludge banks and rags are a hinderance to the 
circulation and may also clog the pump inlet. It is known practice to solve the problem with sludge banks in the 
tank by help of intermittently operating mixing devices of the type 
shown in the Swedish Patent No 8900 597-9. Another method is to 
install special machines which keep the water moving within the tank. Another method which is used to prevent sludge from collecting at the 
bottom of the tank is to design said bottom with steep slopes and 
then arrange the pump inlet at the lowest point, as shown in US-A-4,661,047. However, the problem 
with elongated objects that stick to the guides, the supports etc 
still remains.  
 According to the invention a reduction of the problems mentioned 
above is obtained by help of the device stated in the claims. The invention is described more closely below with reference to the 
enclosed drawing which shows a side cut through a sewage pump station 
designed according to the invention. In the drawing 1 stands for a sewage pump station or a tank having 
wall 2 and bottom 3. 4 and 5 stand for an inlet and an outlet respectively 
for sewage water, 6 and 7 are bottom plates in the tank, 8 a 
submersible pump unit having inlet 9 and outlet 10 with a flange 11. 
12 stands for a connection support having a pipe 13 with a flange 14. 
15 finally, stands for guide bars.

<CLAIMS>
A pump station for sewage water comprising a tank (1) with 
a wall or walls (2) and a bottom (3) and provided with inlet 

(4) and outlet (5) for water, further one or several submersible 
pump units (8) to be lowered to their operating 

positions near the bottom of the tank along guides (15), the 
pump unit (8) in its operating position having its outlet 

(10) in contact with a pipe part (13) arranged on a connection 
support (12) and connected to the tank outlet (5), 

characterized in that the bottom of the tank is provided 
with at least one sloping plane (6), (7) provided with a 

recess accommodating the connection support (12) the pipe 
part (13), a part of the outlet pipe (5) and preferably the 

lower end of the guide (15), which all will be situated 
below the surface of the plane (7) and thereby not constitute 

any hinderance to the flow within the tank. 
A pump station according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the sloping planes (6), (7) are made of sheet metal or plastics, 

one of the planes (7) having an opening for the parts 
(12) and (13). 
A pump station according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the sloping planes (6) and (7) are made of concrete, one of 

the planes having a recess which accommodates the parts (12) 
and (13). 
A pump station according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the guide (15) is releasable from its attachment in the 

connection support (12) and is kept above the water surface 
when the pump operates in order not to disturb the flow in 

the tank.
