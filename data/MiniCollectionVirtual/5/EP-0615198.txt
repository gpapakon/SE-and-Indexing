<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for processing, 
handling and presenting data pertaining to an enterprise 

in the form of a data model. The data within that model 
and the relationships are presented, looked-at and used 

from two different points of view, from an application 
point of view that identifies which entities are used by 

individual program applications, and from an entity point 
of view which identifies all existing entities within a 

program series and their relationships at the different 
levels of decomposition independently of any application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method for processing, 
handling, presenting data pertaining to an enterprise, 
especially a manufacturing enterprise, in the form of a 
data model, in order to improve the understanding of 
business processes. The immense growth of data and applications in enterprises, 
especially also in manufacturing enterprises, leads to 
exorbitant problems in data storage and data usage. This 
kind of chaos is described e. g. in the preface of the 
book "Aufbau betrieblicher Informationssysteme mittels 
konzeptioneller Datenmodellierung" by Max Vetter, 6. Auflage, 
Teubner Verlag, Stuttgart, to be the problem of the 
century. In this article this problem is defined as coping 
with the data chaos which came up nearly everywhere due to 
historically uncontrolled grown data masses. This asks for 
providing a basis that effectively uses possibilities of 
the information technique which points far in the future. 
Such a basis could be an enterprise-wide data model. It is the object of the present invention to provide a data 
model that is able to contribute in solving the problem of 
uncontrolled growth of data in enterprises, especially in 
manufacturing enterprises. The invention solves these problems 
in advantageous manner by applying the features laid 
down in the independent claim. Further advantageous embodiments 
are laid down in the subclaims. The given modelling in accordance with the present invention 
provides an understanding of the present and future  
 
business activities of an enterprise. Thus, for example the 
data model for the manufacturing industry provides a 
consistent view of data across the enterprise, helps to 
prevent data redundancy, enables the sharing of data, 
simplifies the development of application programs, and 
also facilitates an open end user access to the data. The present invention provides a method for processing, 
handling and presenting data pertaining to an enterprise in 
the form of a data model. The data within that model and 
the relationships are presented, looked-at and used from 
two different points of view, from an application point of 
view that identifies which entities are used by individual 
program applications, and from an entity point of view 
which identifies all existing entities within an enterprise 
and their relationships at the different levels of 
decomposition independently of any application. The benefits given by the present invention can be seen 
in that an overview of organization structures and dependency 
of an

in entity relationship diagrams containing textual 

description of that entities, of their relationships 
and their usage. 
Method as in claim 1 or 2, wherein said data is 
grouped into submodels that combine conceptual and 

logical enterprise data. 
Method as in claim 1, 2, or 3, wherein that application 
view is hierarchically organized from application
