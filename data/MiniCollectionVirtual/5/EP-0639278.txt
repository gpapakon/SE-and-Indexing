<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optic speed sensors, 
and more particularly to a simplified optic speed 
sensor having an optical energy output element 
connected to the electrical signal output of a speed 
sensor, typically an electromagnetic speed sensor. In the art of speed sensing, it is known to use 
an electromagnetic sensor to magnetically sense the 
proximate presence and absence, in relation to the 
sensor, of, e.g., teeth on a metallic rotating gear. 
The sensor generates electrical signal pulses that 
correspond to the presence of gear teeth as they rotate 
in proximate vicinity to the sensor. The gear is 
typically an integral component of, e.g., an automotive 
or aircraft engine having a plurality of rotating 
components, the rotating speed of said engine being the 
overall engine parameter desired to be measured. In a specific example of a speed sensor for a 
jet aircraft engine, the electromagnetic sensor must 
operate in a severe environment. The sensor provides 
electrical signals through signal wires over a distance 
of several feet or more to an engine control. The 
engine control processes the electrical signals to 
derive speed information therefrom. Due to the severe environment that the aircraft 
engine and associated sensing and control components 
reside in, the aforementioned signal wires carrying the 
speed information are subject to a number of forms of  
 
interference. The most common form of electromagnetic 
interference is due to lightning, high power RADAR 
signals or other electrical transmitters. Such 
interference may be detected as false speed 
information. It is known to detect the speed of rotation of 
the shaft using a fiber optic sensor, as exemplified in 
U.S Patent 4,746,791 to Forkel. This patent describes 
a number of embodiments of such a sensor. In only one 
of the embodiments is an optical source, such as a 
light emitting diode ("LED"), provided in the housing 
of the sensor. However, in this embodiment, the LED 
must be supplied with power from an external power 
supply. Such external power lead wires are a weight 
penalty and may be subject to the aforementioned 
interference effects. Further, the remaining 
embodiments require optical energy to be transmitted 
from an external source disposed away from the sensor 
housing. Thus additional components are required, 
adding undesirable cost, weight and complexity to the 
sensor. In addition, for use with fiber optic sensors, 
the present day optic signal fibers have a major 
reliability problem in the optical
