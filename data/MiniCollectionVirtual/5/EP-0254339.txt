<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement with a phase-locked loop PLL (11) 
having an output (17) coupled to an input (23) of a hold 

circuit (24) also comprises detection means (27) for 
detecting an instantaneous interference (Fig. 4b) in the 

signal present at the input (10) of the PLL (11) and for 
subsequently generating a control signal (Fig. 4e) which is 

applied to a control input (29) of the hold circuit (24). 
The hold circuit (24) is adapted to retain the signal 

applied to its input (23) during the time interval (T₃) 
when the control signal is presented to its control input 

(29). The detection means (27) are adapted to determine 
a phase-lock error between the signal at the input (10) 

of the PLL (11) and the signal at the output (20) of 
the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO (19) associated with 

the PLL (11) and to generate the control signal if 
the phase-lock error exceeds a given value, for example, 

45°. A better detection of the instantaneous interferences 
can be realised with such an arrangement, rather than if 

the amplitude information (if present) of the signal 
at the input (10) of the PLL (11) had been used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement comprising 
an input terminal for receiving an electric input signal, 
which terminal is coupled to an input of a phase-locked 
loop having an output coupled to an input of a hold 
circuit an output of which is coupled to an output terminal 
of the arrangement for supplying an electric output signal, 
said phase-locked loop comprising a phase comparator having 
a first input coupled to the input of the phase-locked loop, 
a second input and an output, a low-pass filter having an 
input and an output coupled to the output of the phase 
comparator and to the output of the phase-locked loop, 
respectively, a voltage-controlled oscillator having an input 
and an output coupled to the output of the low-pass 
filter and to the second input of the phase comparator, 
respectively, said arrangement further comprising detection 
means for detecting an instantaneous interference in the 
input signal of the phase-locked loop and for subsequently 
generating a control signal and for applying said control 
signal to an output which is coupled to a control input 
of the hold circuit, said hold circuit being adapted to 
retain the signal applied to its input under the influence 
of the control signal. An arrangement of this type may be incorporated, 
for example, in a video recorder for demodulating, after 
reading a registration carrier, an audio signal which is 
written in FM-modulated form into the registration carrier, 
for which purpose the arrangement further comprises: 
two or more reading heads provided on a rotatable head 
drum,  switching means having two or more inputs, an output and a 
control input, which switching means are adapted to couple 
one of the inputs to the output under the influence of 
a control signal to be applied to the control input, an  
 
output of each of the two or more reading heads being 
coupled to an associated input of the two or more inputs 
of the switching means and the output of the switching 
means being coupled to an input of  a limiter which is coupled between the input terminal of 
the arrangement and an input of the detection means.  The arrangement is intended to compensate for 
instantaneous interferences in the input signal of the 
phase -locked loop. This input signal is an FM-modulated 
signal in its use in video recorders. The instantaneous 
interferences are those interferences affecting the regularity 
in the afore-mentioned signal. These interferences may 
be, for example, drop-outs or drop-ins in the input signal 
of the
