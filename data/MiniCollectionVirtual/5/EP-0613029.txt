<ABSTRACT>
We describe an interferometric, channel-dropping, optical filter that 
includes a pair of planar waveguides (20,30). The two waveguides are spaced apart 

by a distance which is periodically varied along the longitudinal axis of the filter in 
order to effect a periodic optical coupling between them. There are at least three 

coupling locations (40), each associated with a coupling constant. The two 
waveguides have nominally equal effective refractive indices. In preferred 

embodiments of the invention, the coupling constants decrease symmetrically from 
the center of the filter toward the ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to passive components for processing optical
signals, and more particularly, to those components that are fabricated as planar
optical waveguides.Wavelength-division multiplexing devices are of interest for the
processing and distribution of signals in optical communication networks. One
important technology for making such devices is silicon optical bench (SiOB)
technology. In SiOB technology, planar optical waveguides, and devices based
thereon, are fabricated on planar silicon substrates. A typical SiOB waveguide
includes a lower silicon dioxide cladding, and a core and upper cladding of
phosphosilicate glass deposited on the substrate and lithographically patterned.
(SiOB methods are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,902,086, issued to
C.H. Henry, et al. on Feb. 20, 1990.) This technology is particularly useful for
applications in the communication industry because it makes possible highly
compact packaging of complex optical circuits, as well as integration of optical
sources and detectors on the silicon substrates.According to a second technology based on planar waveguides, the
waveguiding components are manufactured from III-V semiconductor materials,
rather than from silica-based materials. Aspects of this technology are described,
e.g., in M. Zirngibl, et al., "Efficient 1 × 16 Optical Power Splitter Based on InP,"
Electron. Lett. 28 (1992) 1212 - 1213, and in M. Zirngibl, et al., "Demonstration of a
15 × 15 Arrayed Waveguide Multiplexer on InP," IEEE Photon. Technol.Lett.4
(1992) 1250- 1253.Some designs for optical communication networks call for a
wavelength-division multiplexer (WDM) capable of serving as a broadband,
channel-dropping filter (or more generally, a channel adding/dropping filter). Such a
device would, for example, have one input port and two output ports, to be denoted
Ch. 1 and Ch. 2. In the absence of resonant effects, the input stream would be passed
through to Ch. 2. However, input sub-channels having selected, resonant
wavelengths would be directed to Ch. 1. By way of illustration, some proposed
networks would carry communication signals in the 1.3-µm and 1.55-µm
wavelength bands, and for fault-detection by optical time-domain reflectometry 
(OTDR), the same networks would carry diagnostic signals in the 1.42-µm band. A
WDM filter would be useful for separating the two signal bands from the diagnostic
band.However, in optical communication networks, it will generally be
desirable to avoid the use of filters with sharply peaked passbands.

A spectrally discriminating optical filter which comprises a substrate and
first and second optical waveguides (20, 30) formed

on the substrate and extending along a predetermined longitudinal axis of the substrate, said waveguides having respective first and second effective
refractive indices, wherein:


a) said waveguides are spaced apart by a distance that varies
periodically along the longitudinal axis, such that the filter is subdivided into stages

(10) where said distance is relatively large and coupling sections (40) where said
distance is relatively small, said subdivision resulting in N stages, N at least 2, and

N+1 approximately equally spaced-apart coupling sections, each stage being situated
between two adjacent coupling sections;
b) the first waveguide is optically coupled to the second waveguide in
each of the coupling sections; and
c) the optical path length within each stage is greater in the first
waveguide than in the second waveguide,
