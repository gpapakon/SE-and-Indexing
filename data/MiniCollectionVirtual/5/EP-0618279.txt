<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
suitable for ink-jet recording. The present invention
also relates to an ink-jet recording method for
conducting recording by ejection of the ink through an
orifice of a recording head, preferably by action of
thermal energy, on paper, and to an apparatus for the
recording. The present invention further relates to a
process for producing the above ink.The ink-jet recording system has advantages of
less noise generation during recording, and higher
recording speed with higher resolution owing to a
highly integrated head. The ink-jet recording system
usually employs an ink which contains a water-soluble
dye dissolved in water or a mixture of water with an
organic solvent. The ink containing a water-soluble
dye generally has a disadvantage of low light-fastness
of recorded images because of the inherent low light-fastness
of the water-soluble dye. The water-soluble
ink frequently involves problems in water resistance
such that the recorded image becomes blurred or flows
out when the recorded image is brought into contact 
with rain, sweat, or drinking water.On the other hand, stationery utensils using
dye such as ball-point pens involve similar problems.
For improvement in light-fastness and water resistance
of the record, various aqueous pigment-containing inks
have been disclosed for stationery utensils. For
practical use of an aqueous pigment ink, methods for
stabilization of pigment dispersion, prevention of ink
solidification at a pen tip, and prevention of abrasion
of a ball of a ball-point pen are disclosed, for
example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos.
58-80368, 61-200182, 61-247774, 61-272278, 62-568, 62-101671,
62-101672, 1-249869, 1-301760, and so forth.
Recently, ball-point pens and felt-tip pens which
employ an aqueous pigment ink have come into market.Ink-jet inks which employ an aqueous pigment
ink, a specific water-soluble solvent, and a polymeric
dispersing agent are disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open Nos. 56-147859, and 56-147860.
Inks which employ a pigment and a dye in combination
are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 4-57859, and 4-57860.Conventional aqueous pigment inks, however,
have disadvantages that quality and density of recorded
images deteriorate remarkably depending on the kind of
the paper, especially when the images are recorded on
plain paper (e.g., copying paper, bond paper, or the 
like, widely used in offices). This results from the
fact that the surface state of the plain paper
