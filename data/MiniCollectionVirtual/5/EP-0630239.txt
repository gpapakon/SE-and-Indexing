<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions are disclosed utilizing optically pure R(-) ketoprofen for the treatment of pain including, but not limited to, pain associated with toothaches, headaches, sprains, joint pain and post-surgical pain, for example dental pain and ophthalmic pain, while substantially reducing adverse effects including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicities, and leukopenia, which are associated with the administration of racemic ketoprofen. Optically pure R(-) ketoprofen is also useful in treating pyrexia while substantially reducing the adverse effects associated with the administration of racemic ketoprofen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIPYRETIC AND ANALGESIC METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING OPTICALLY PURE R(-) KETOPROFEN1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel compositions of matter containing optically pure R(-) ketoprofen. These compositions possess potent activity in treating pain including but not limited to, pain associated 0 with toothaches, headaches, sprains, joint pain and surgical pain, for example dental pain and ophthalmic pain, while substantially reducing adverse effects associated with the administration of the racemic mixture of ketoprofen including but not limited to 5 gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicities, as well as leukopenia. Additionally, these novel compositions of matter containing optically pure R(-) ketoprofen are useful in treating or preventing pyrexia while substantially reducing the adverse 0 effects associated with the administration of the racemic ketoprofen. Also disclosed are methods for treating the above-described conditions in a human while substantially reducing the adverse effects that are associated with the racemic mixture of ketoprofen, 5 by administering the R(-) isomer of ketoprofen to said human.The active compound of these compositions and methods is an optical isomer of ketoprofen. Ketoprofen is described in United States Patent No. 0 3,641,127. Chemically, the active compound is the R(-) isomer of 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid, hereinafter referred to as R(-) ketoprofen. The term "R(-) isomer of ketoprofen" and particularly the term "R(-) ketoprofen" encompass optically pure and _ substantially optically pure R(-) ketoprofen. 

 Ketoprofen, which is the subject of the present invention, is available commercially only as the 1:1 racemic mixture. That is, ketoprofen is available only as a mixture of optical isomers, called enantiomers.1.1. Steric Relationship and Drug Action Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s) . The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific
