<ABSTRACT>
The pilot valve with bistable effect is characterised in that it consists of a body (31) in which an inlet orifice (33) communicates with a shut-off piston assembly (C1) located within the cylindrical body of the pilot valve and moves in a sleeve (liner) (35, 39) provided at least at one end of a seat (354, 355, 390), the shut-off piston (C1) placing the inlet orifice (33) in communication with a chamber (M) which communicates on the one hand with an inlet-outlet orifice (34) and, on the other, with a mechanical circuit-breaking pilot valve (C2) with bistable effect which, in its second stable position, places the chamber (M) in communication with another outlet (36).
