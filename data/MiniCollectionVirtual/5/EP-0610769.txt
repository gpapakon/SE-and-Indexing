<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic gap-less loudspeaker of a high 
performance which has a good quality of a voice coil and 

provides easy wiring between tinsel wires and the voice 
coil. In the magnetic gap-less loudspeaker, two magnets 

(M1, M2) magnetized in the thickness direction are 
disposed with the same poles being faced each other and a 

voice coil (1) is disposed in a magnetic field generated 
by repulsion magnetic fluxes near at the outer 

circumferential areas of the magnets, wherein a 
reinforced paper 1B or bobbin material 1A1 is attached to 

at least a partial area of the outer surface of the voice 
coil. Conductive areas 1C are provided to the reinforced 

paper or bobbin material to which areas coil lead wires 
or tinsel wires are connected.

<DESCRIPTION>
Be it known that I, Yoshio SAKAMOTO, subject of
Japan, at 108-6-503 Yokokawa-cho, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo,
Japan have invented a certain new and useful improvement
in LOUDSPEAKER of which the following is a full, clear,
concise and exact description. The present invention relates to a loudspeaker, and
more particularly to a magnetic gap-less loudspeaker in
which two magnets magnetized in the thickness direction
are disposed with the same poles being faced each other
and a voice coil is disposed in a magnetic field
generated by repulsion magnetic fluxes near at the outer
circumferential areas of the magnets.As shown in Fig.1, a conventional loudspeaker has a
magnetic circuit constituted by a yoke Y, a magnet M, and
a top plate TP. A voice coil 1 is disposed between the
york Y and top plate TP or between the outer
circumference of a yoke pole YP and the inner
circumference of the top plate TP. The voice coil 1 is
wound about a tubular bobbin 1A which drives a diaphragm
3 made of cone paper or the like.It is well known that tinsel cords 2 are connected
to coil lead wires 11 and 12 by solder to form wirings
through which a voice signal is inputted to the voice
coil 1. There are three main wiring types. In the first 
type, as shown in Fig.1, the coil lead wires 11 and 12
extending from the coil winding start point 13 and end
point 14 are cut to have a predetermined length necessary
for wiring, and pulled up along the outer wall of the
bobbin 1A near to the upper end of the bobbin 1A. The
pulled-up lead wires are fixed to the outer wall of the
bobbin 1A by a reinforced paper 1B or the like. The end
portions of the coil lead wires 11 and 12 extending out
of the reinforced paper 1B are subjected to terminal
processing, namely the insulating layers of the end
portions of the coil lead wires 11 and 12 are removed to
expose the inner conductive wires which are coated by
solder.In assembling the voice coil to a loudspeaker, the
coil lead wires 11 and 12 are led along the surface of
the diaphragm 3 near to holes 31 or eyelets. The end
portions 21 of the tinsel wires 2 inserted into the holes
31 are soldered to the coil lead wires 11 and 12 at the
solder coated portions thereof. The soldered regions and
the coil lead wires on the surface of the diaphragm 3 are
fixed by adhesive agent A or the like. The other ends 22
of the tinsel wires 2 are connected to input lug
terminals 4.In the second type shown in Fig.2, similar to the
first type, the coil lead wires 11 and 12 extending from 
the coil winding start point 13 and end
