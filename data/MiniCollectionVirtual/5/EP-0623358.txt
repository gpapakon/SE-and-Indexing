<ABSTRACT>
A safety device for a needle 16 has a housing 6 hinged to a base 2 attached to the needle. The 
housing 6 has a lock 22, for engaging the needle 16, and a fluid-absorbing material such as a 

foam 26, which contacts the needle before engagement of the lock. The needle 16 can pass 
through the fluid-absorbing material 26, which absorbs any fluid collected at the tip of the 

needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to safety devices for use with a needle. The invention is more particularly concerned with sheaths for preventing the tip of a 
hypodermic needle being exposed after use. In US Patent 4,982,842 there is disclosed a safety needle device comprising a housing 
hinged to a base of the device. The housing is pivotable to a position in alignment with a 
needle mated to the device so as to enclose the needle. This device has proven to be quite 
effective in preventing accidental needle pricks. Fluid, such as blood or medicament can collect inside or outside the needle after use and 
it is possible for this fluid to be splattered, splashed or aerosolized into the atmosphere when 
the protective housing is pivoted to enclose the needle. This has been found to be particularly 
the case when the housing has an integrated lock, such as a hook, that snaps onto the needle as 
the housing is pivoted over the needle. The fluid that is aerosolized or atomized may be 
contaminated, such as, for example, contaminated blood carrying the HIV virus. It is an object of the present invention to provide a needle sheath with a reduced risk of 
splattering. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a safety device of 
the above-specified kind, in that the device includes a base secured with the needle, a housing 
hingedly attached to the base that can be pivoted to a position in substantially alignment along 
the longitudinal axis of the needle for substantially sheathing the needle, and an absorbing 
material on the housing arranged to absorb fluid collected at the needle as the housing is 
pivoted to the alignment position and the needle contacts the absorbing material.  The device preferably includes a lock integral with the housing, the lock fixedly 
retaining the needle within the housing once the housing is pivoted to the alignment position. 
The absorbing material may be located on an end of the housing remote from the base, the 
absorbing material being configured to contact the needle as the housing is pivoted to the 
alignment position, before the needle contacts the lock. Alternatively, the device may include a 
member on the housing that cooperates with second member on the base and prevents relative 
movement between the housing and the base once the housing is pivoted to the alignment 
position. The absorbing material may be configured to contact the needle before the first and 
second members fully cooperate to prevent relative movement between the housing and the 
bas

<CLAIMS>
A safety device for use with a needle, characterised in that the device includes a 
base (2) secured with the needle (16), a housing (6) hingedly attached to the 

base (2) that can be pivoted to a position in substantially alignment along the 
longitudinal
 axis of the needle (16) for substantially sheathing the needle, and 
an absorbing material (26) on the housing (6) arranged to absorb fluid collected 

at the needle (16) as the housing (6) is pivoted to the alignment position and 
the needle contacts the absorbing material (26). 
A safety device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the device includes a 
lock (22) integral with the housing (6) and that the lock (22) fixedly retains the 

needle (16) within the housing (6) once the housing (6) is pivoted to the 
alignment position. 
A safety device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the absorbing 
material (26) is located on an end of the housing (6) remote from the base (2), 

and that the absorbing material (26) is configured to contact the needle (16) as 
the housing (6) is pivoted to the alignment position, before the needle contacts 

the lock (22). 
A safety device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the device includes a 
member (28, 36) on the housing (6) that cooperates with a second member (30, 

32, 34) on the base (2) and prevents relative movement between the housing 
(6) and the base (2) once the housing is pivoted to the alignment position. 
A safety device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the absorbing 
material (26) is configured to contact the needle (16) before the first and 

second members (28, 36 and 30, 32, 34, 38) fully cooperate to prevent relative 
movement between the housing (6) and the base (2). 
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the absorbing material (26) comprises a fluid-absorbing material with 

sufficient yield to allow the needle (16) to traverse therethrough when the 
housing (6) is pivoted to the alignment position. 
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the absorbing material comprises a foam. 
A safety device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
absorbing material comprises cotton or a sponge.
