<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for preparing 1,2-diacyl-2-(
t
-alkyl)hydrazines. 
More particularly, the present invention a process for preparing 

the aforesaid diacylhydrazines utilizing a solvent comprising an ester or a mixture of 
an ester and water in a process wherein an aromatic acid chloride is reacted in a first 

step with a 
t
-alkylhydrazine or a corresponding acid addition salt of a 
t
-alkylhydrazine 
such as the hydrochloride salt in the presence of a base to afford a 1-acyl-2-
t
-alkylhydrazine 
followed by a second step wherein an aromatic acid chloride 

is reacted with the aforesaid monoacylhydrazine in the presence of a base to afford 
the desired 1,2-diacyl-2-(
t
-alkyl)hydrazine. Such compounds are known to have 
excellent insecticidal activity against insects of the orders Lepidoptera and 

Coleoptera.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing 1,2-diacyl-2-(t-alkyl)hydrazines. 
More particularly, the present invention is concerned 
with a process for preparing the aforesaid diacylhydrazines, utilizing a solvent 
comprising an ester or a mixture of an ester and water, and in which process an 
aromatic acid chloride is reacted in a first step with a t-alkylhydrazine or a 
corresponding acid addition salt of a t-alkylhydrazine such as the hydrochloride salt 
in the presence of a base to afford a 1-acyl-2-t-alkylhydrazine followed by 
a second step wherein another aromatic acid chloride is reacted with the aforesaid 
monoacylhydrazine in the presence of a base to afford the desired 1,2-diacyl-2-(t-alkyl)hydrazine. 
Such compounds are known to have excellent insecticidal activity 
against insects of the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. The search for process solvents which are environmentally friendly, 
which are easily removed from the desired product, which provide good selectivity 
to the desired intermediates and products, which are easily recovered from the 
desired products, which allow a facile purification of the desired products, which 
possess favorable solubility properties for both the reactants and the desired 
intermediates and products, which can be used in all steps of the process, which are 
inert to the reaction conditions and which possess favorable process economics is a 
continuing one because of the difficulty in finding solvents or mixtures of solvents 
which fulfill all these important conditions. For example, US-A-4,985,461 discloses a 
process leading to 1,2-diacyl-2-(t-alkyl)hydrazines which employs one or more 
solvents such as water, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, 
hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, hexane and heptane, glyme, 
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, pyridine, haloalkanes such as methylene chloride or 
mixtures of these solvents. However, all these solvents suffer from one or more of 
the deficiencies previously noted. For example, water by itself results in poor 
intermediate and product yields and poor selectivity with a large amount of 
diacylation of the t-butylhydrazine occurring in the first process step. Alcohols such 
as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol react with the acid chlorides, thus 
resulting in undesirable consumption of the acid chlorides and complicating the 
recovery and recycle of the process solvents. Hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, 
hexane and heptane provide poor reaction selectivity in the
