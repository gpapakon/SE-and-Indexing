<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to dye-donor elements 
for thermal dye transfer and, more particularly, to the 
use of mixtures of indoaniline dyes with at least one 
such dye containing an alkyl group substituted with a 
group capable of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and 
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,621,271. An important requirement for any thermal dye-donor 
element is to maintain performance over its 
useful lifetime without degradation in image quality. 
The dye layer of a dye-donor element for resistive head 
thermal dye transfer generally comprises a polymeric  
 
binder and diffusible dyes. The percentage of dye in 
the layer is typically quite high, in the range of 20 
to 80%. The dye is usually dissolved in the binder or 
phase-separated into small domains. During keeping of 
the dye-donor element, the temperature and humidity may 
be elevated and the dye layer is in contact with a 
slipping layer coated on the backside of the dye-donor 
element when it is wound up in spool form. The 
slipping layer may contain mobile lubricating oils or 
materials which can act as plasticizers or solvents for 
the dye layer. This can lead to dye mobility, 
resulting in changes in the layer including further 
phase separation, migration of the dye to the surface, 
and possible crystallization of the dye. Dye may also 
transfer to the slipping layer.
