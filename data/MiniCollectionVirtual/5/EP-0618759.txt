<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is an apparatus for control technology, metrology, regulation technology and/or data processing technology having a housing which has an extruded profile (section) with a U-shaped cross-section. The housing (1) can be closed by means of a cover. Angled metal sheets (11, 12) can optionally be fitted on two mutually opposite housing sides in a position for mounting the housing on a supporting part at the rear or in a position for mounting the housing on a supporting part which has an opening for the housing. A male connector strip (20) is provided in each case on at least one housing side, to which internal leads are connected for external connections from the apparatus. A screw-terminal contact strip (21) which has openings (43) for external leads (46) to pass through can be plugged onto the male connector strip (20), said external leads (46) running in the longitudinal direction of the male contacts (23) of the male connector strip (20) when the screw-terminal contact strips (21) are plugged on. In chambers (42) into which the passage openings (43) open, the screw terminal contact strip (21) has screws (40), which are accessible from one side, for the terminal contacts and it can optionally be plugged onto the male connector strip (20) in positions rotated through 180@.

Apparatus of the controlling, measuring, regulating and/or data 
processing technology, with a housing which comprises an extrusion (2) 

with U-shaped cross-section, the forwardly oriented open side of which is 
closable by a cover (3) and which comprises two angle brackets (11, 12), 

which are mountable on two mutually opposite housing sides selectably in 
a position for fastening of the housing to a rearward support member or 

in a position for fastening of the housing in a cutout of a support 
member, characterised thereby that provided on at least one of these 

housing sides is a respective blade strip (20), with which internal leads 
for external connections of the apparatus are connected, that plugged 

onto the blade strip (20) is a screw clamping contact strip (21), which 
has passage openings (43) for external leads (46) which extend in 

longitudinal direction of the blades (23) of the blade strip (20) when 
the screw clamping contact strip (21) is plugged on, and that the screw 

clamping contact strip (21) comprises screws (40), which are accessible 
from one side in chambers (42) into which the passage openings (43) open, 

for the clamping contacts and is pluggable onto the blade strip (20) 
selectably in settings turned through 180°. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised thereby that two blade 
strips (20) are arranged respectively on plates (3, 5), which are 

respectively fastened on mutually opposed open sides of the extrusion 
(2). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the 
blade strips (20) have Dins (26) on their sides facing the housing 

interior, which pins are connected with conductor tracks of a 
circuitboard (27), which is guided in grooves of the extrusion (2). 
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that the circuitboard (27) is connected with the 

two blade strips (20) and is provided with at least two slots (49, 50), 
which partly overlap at a spacing from one another.  

 
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that the opening between the free ends of the limbs 

of the extrusion (2) is closable by a lid (8) which can be screwed on and 
which is provided on its housin
g inner side with spacer pins (52) on 
which a further circuitboard (53) with electronic components is fastened, 

and that the conductor tracks of the circuitboard (53) are connected by 
way of a plug connector (54) and a cable (55) with conductor tracks of 

the circuitboard (27) connected to the blade strips (20). 
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that the blade strip (20) comprises a 

parallelepipedonal housing, of which one side protrudes in the middle in 
longitudinal direction of the blades (22) and that the screw clamping 

contact strip (21) contains a housing, which is connected in mechanically 
positive manner in the housing of the blade strip (20) and has chambers 

(39), into which the blades (23) respectively project and which are 
provided with the passage openings (43), through which the blades (23) 

are accessible at least at a wide side for the applying of the wire ends, 
that in the chambers (39) frame elements (41) are displaceable 

transversely to the blades by means of screws (40) rotatably arranged in 
the chambers and that the frame elements (41) press together the wire 

ends and the blades (23) in end positions. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised thereby that the blades 
(23) are Darts of flat metal strips (24), which at their free portions 

(25) remote from the blades (23) are turned through 90° relative to the 
wide side of the blades (23) and are bent over through about 90° behind 

the turning point and each have at least one pin (26) for insertion into 
a circuitboard aperture. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised thereby that in 
addition to the pin (26) a blade contact (28) is arranged at the end of 

the portion (25).  
 
Apparatus according to one or more of claims 6 to 8, characterised 
thereby that intermediate walls (29) are provided between the portions 

(25). 
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that in the housing (22) of the blade strip (20) 

each blade (23) is surrounded by a groove (30), the portions of which 
extend at a spacing from the respective blade (23) parallelly to the 

sides thereof, and that a strip (44), which projects from the housing 
(38) of the screw clamping contact strip (21), is insertable into each 

groove (30).
