<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to a device for imprinting data in the form of points on radiographic film (X-ray film) (2), light emitting diodes (8) arranged in a column being moved across the radiographic film (2) transverse to the direction (A) of the column and being excited to luminesce in a temporal sequence and corresponding to the data (5) to be imprinted. The light emitting diodes (8) are designed in such a way that both green-sensitive and blue-sensitive radiographic film (2) is exposed by light emitting diodes (8) whose emitted light has an intensity maximum in the wavelength range between 400 and 510 nm.

Method for point by point exposure of data on X-ray film
(2) by means of light-emitting diodes (8), a relative movement

being carried out transverse to the column direction (A) between
the light-emitting diodes (8) arranged in a column and the X-ray

film (2) and the light-emitting diodes (8) being induced to emit
light in time sequence according to the data (5) to be exposed,


characterised in that
 both green-sensitive and blue-sensitive X-ray
film (2) is exposed by the light-emitting diodes (8), the

light-emitting diodes (8) used to expose the data emit light
having a maximum intensity in the wavelength range between 400

and 510 nm and the light-emitting diodes (8) are controlled
pulse-wise to expose a data point while the relative movement is

being carried out, in such a way that the transmission density
points of a plurality of light pulses partially overlap on the

X-ray film (2).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
light-emitting diodes (8) are moved over the X-ray film (2)

obliquely to the column direction.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the data are digitised.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the X-ray film (2) is in an X-ray film
cartridge (3) comprising an exposure window (4) by which the

data on the X-ray film (2) are exposed and the exposure window 
(4) is first completely opened and then the X-ray film (2)

exposed.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the
light-emitting diodes (8) are rigidly connected to means (11)

which open and close the exposure window (4) and 
in that
 the
exposure of the X-ray film (2) is carried out simultaneously

with closure of the exposure window (4).
Method according t o any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the light-emitting diodes (8) are rigidly
connected to an X-ray film processing apparatus and 
in that
 the
X-ray film (2) is conveyed past the light-emitting diodes (8).
Device for the point by po int exposure of data (5) on
green-sensitive X-ray film (2) with light-emitting diodes (8)

arranged in a column, the device being designed such that a
relative movement can be carried out transverse to the column

direction (A) between the light-emitting diodes (8) and the
green-sensitive X-ray film (2) and the light-emitting diodes (8)

can be induced to emit light in time sequence according to the
data to be exposed, 
characterised in that
 the light which can be
emitted by the light-emitting diodes (8) has a maximum intensity

in the wavelength range between 400 and 510 nm and the
light-emitting diodes (8) are controlled pulse-wise to expose a data

point while the relative movement is being carried out, in such
a way that the transmission density points of a plurality of

light pulses partially overlap on the X-ray film (2).
Device according to claim 7, 
characterised by
 two opposing
parallel columns of light-emitting diodes (8) arranged offset 

from one another in column direction (A) by a fraction (v) of a
light diode width (d).

optical means comprise a lens system (6).
Device according to claim 12, 
characterised in that
 the
optical means comprise optical fibres.
Device according to any one of claims 7 to 14,
