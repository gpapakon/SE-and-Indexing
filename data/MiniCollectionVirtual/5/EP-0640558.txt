<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a harnessing device for exercising and leading horses. This device comprises at least one prompting member (10, 25) which is placed around the bottom of the horse's neck (5) and means (12a, 23) for pulling the said member upwards and backwards. This prompting member (10, 25) is designed to exert an uncomfortable prompting action around the bottom of the horse's neck (5), in an area between the third cervical vertebra and the first dorsal vertebra, as soon as the position of the top (6) of the horse's neck (5) deviates from a target position by a predetermined lower limit.
