<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns condensation products containing N,O-acetal- or carbonamide structures, the products being characterized in that they are obtained by the condensation of (a) compounds containing at least once the structural element (I) or (II) in which X=OH or NHR, R being C1 to C6 alkyl or -CH2-COOH, with (b) aldehydes, ketones or aldehydic or ketonic carboxylic acids to give acetal lactones and by subsequently splitting the acetal lactones with (c) aminocarboxylic acids, primary or secondary amines and/or polyethylenimines to give condensation products containing N,O-acetal- or carbonamide structures. The invention also concerns methods of preparing such products and their use as additives in washing and cleaning agents. The invention further concerns condensation products containing acetal lactone structures produced by reacting (a) hydroxycarboxylic acids or secondary aminoacids with polyhydroxy compounds and condensing with (b) aldehydes, ketones or aldehydic or ketonic carboxylic acids.
