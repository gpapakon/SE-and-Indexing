<ABSTRACT>
A plastic tape and an adhesive tape are provided, as 
well as a method of manufacture of a body wrapped with 

these tapes, whereby a tape is used which has an initial 
elastic area (A), an adjacent area of plastic deformation (B) 

and, finally, an area with greatly increasing tensile (C) up 
to the breaking point. The advantage of the invention 

lies in that a simple, low-cost and material-saving 
process is provided which makes it possible to form a 

highly conformable wrapping and a highly flexible wrapped 
body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a plastic tape, an adhesive 
tape with a plastic tape as carrier, especially a plastic 
tape or an adhesive tape which is suitable for wrapping 
around an irregular body, as well as a process for 
manufacture of a body wrapped with a plastic tape or 
adhesive tape. The body can be a group of electrical, 
hydraulic of fiber optic lines or cables, respectively, 
which are used, for example, in a motor vehicle. In the 
following, the term "tape" is normally used to mean a 
plastic tape or an adhesive tape. Processes are already known whereby several cables 
or wires are bundled together using plastic bands or 
strips. Plastic tapes normally used for this purpose are 
often filled with additives, fillers and/or pigments in 
order to provide special properties such as flame 
resistance or special electrical properties. The plastic 
tapes can be simply wound around the cables or wires or 
can be coated on one side with an adhesive, for example, 
a pressure-sensitive adhesive, so that the tape adheres 
better to itself and to the body around which it is 
wound. Because of harsh environments like heat, moisture or 
aggressive atmospheres to which the wrapped bodies can be 
exposed, special plastic tapes are often used for these 
applications. The tapes are used either in uncoated form 
or in the form of an adhesive tape with an adhesive 
coating. Polyimide tapes or polyester tapes have been 
used for such applications, for example. Plasticized 
PVC, easily modified by means of additives, has been used 
especially often for wrapping of groups of cable and wire 
because of economic reasons. Admittedly, chlorine-containing 
plastics like PVC have disadvantages because 
of their effect on the environment. For example, these 
kinds of plastics cannot be incinerated without  
 
liberation of toxic gases and cannot be recycled or 
melted easily. In addition, in the case of plasticized 
PVC the plasticizer can migrate out of the tape with 
time, whereby the plastic tape becomes brittle. The 
plasticizer can also migrate into nearby materials like 
the adhesive layer of wiring insulation, thereby altering 
their properties. The most important disadvantage of 
using PVC tapes for wrapping of irregularly shaped 
bodies, however, is their unsuitable elongation 
properties when placed under extending forces and their 
insufficient ability to conform to irregularly-shaped 
bodies. EP-A-0 274 888 describes a halogen-free, 
thermoplastic elastomer composition which contains a 
flame-retardant
