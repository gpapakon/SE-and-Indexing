<ABSTRACT>
Leak detecting installation for leaktightness checking of flexible or rigid sealed packages (3), containing a certain proportion of tracer gas, including a conveyor belt (1), a bell (5) located above the said conveyor and including a motor means (6) making it possible to raise the said bell and lower it until it comes to bear on the belt (4) of the said conveyor (1), the said bell (5) being connected to a tracer-gas leak detector (12), the whole being controlled by control electronics (21), characterised in that, the said belt (4) being made of a nonporous and non-openworked material, the bell (5) carries means (8, 9) at its lower periphery which ensure, when the bell (5) is in the bottom position and interacting with the belt (4) of the said conveyor (1), leaktightness of the said bell, in that the bell is connected to a vacuum pump (11) and in that a backing plate (13) equipped with a system of seals (16, 17) is arranged under the said belt, in line with the said bell (5), the said backing plate being recessed (14) and connected by a hose (15) to the said bell.

A leak-detection installation for testing the gastightness of 
flexible or rigid sealed packages (3) containing a certain 

concentration of tracer gas, said installation including a belt 
conveyor (1), a bell-shaped cover (5) situated above said conveyor 

and including drive means (6) enabling said cover to be raised and to 
be lowered until it bears against the belt (4) of said conveyor (1), 

said cover (5) being connected to a tracer gas leak detector (12), 
the resulting assembly being controlled by control electronic 

circuitry (21), said installation being characterized in that said 
belt (4) is made of a material that is both non-porous and non-perforated, 

and in that the cover (5) carries sealing means (8, 9) at 
its bottom periphery for co-operating with the belt (4) of said 

conveyor (1) to guarantee the gastightness of said cover (5) when it 
is in the low position, in that the cover is connected to a vacuum 

pump (11), and in that a backing plate (13) provided with a system of 
sealing rings (16, 17) is disposed under said belt and in alignment 

with said cover (5), said backing plate having a recess (14) and 
being connected to said cover via a hose (15). 
An installation according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
means for guaranteeing the gastightness of said cover comprise two 

concentric sealing rings (8, 9), in that the system of sealing rings 
of said backing plate comprises two concentric sealing rings (16, 

17), and in that a second vacuum pump (18) is connected to the space 
between the sealing rings of said cover and to the space between the 

sealing rings of said plate. 
An installation according to any preceding claim, characterized in 
that, when the cover is in the low position, a rigid surface (19) 

that is secured to the cover (5), and whose outline matches the top 
portion of said package (3) comes into the immediate vicinity of said 

top portion without compressing it.
