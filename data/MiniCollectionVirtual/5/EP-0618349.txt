<ABSTRACT>
A turbine assembly (20) for a gas turbine engine 
(10) comprises alternate annular arrays of rotor blades 

(24) and stator vanes (40) enclosed in an annular casing 
(60). Each stator vane (40) is secured by a platform (44) 

at its radially outer extent, to the casing (60). A bolt 
(50) extends through a flange (49) on the platform (44) 

to locate the stator vane (40) relative to the casing 
(60) and prevents any circumferential movement of the 

stator vane (40). The bolt (50) extends radially through 
the casing (60) to engage an annular cooling duct (70). 

The annular cooling duct (70) encloses the casing (60) to 
define a cavity (72) through which in operation cooling 

air passes to cool the casing (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a turbine assembly 
for a gas turbine engine and in particular to the 
mounting of stator vanes and a cooling duct in such a 
turbine. A turbine for a gas turbine engine typically 
comprises a casing which encloses alternate arrays of 
radially extending rotor aerofoil blades and stator 
aerofoil vanes. The stator vanes are connected at their 
radially outer extents to the turbine casing whilst the 
rotor blades of each annular array are attached at their 
radially inner extents to a rotor disc. The stator vanes 
direct hot combustion gases onto the rotor blades which 
rotate to extract energy from the hot combustion gases. It is important to ensure that the turbine does not 
absorb heat to such an extent that it is detrimental to 
safe operation. Cooling air is used to control the 
temperature of the turbine casing and ensure a even 
temperature distribution. The cooling air controls the 
thermal growth of the turbine casing which maintains 
blade tip clearance and hence improves the efficiency of 
the engine. Compressor air is used to cool the turbine casing. 
The compressor air passes through an annular cooling duct 
mounted on the turbine casing. The cooling duct has 
conventionally been mounted by means of bolts which 
project radially from the turbine casing. Special 
brackets are riveted onto the casing to hold the bolts in 
place. Riveting brackets onto the casing reduces the 
integrity of the turbine casing. The present invention seeks to provide a turbine 
assembly in which the way in which the stator vanes and 
the cooling duct are mounted on the turbine casing is 
simplified. The present invention reduces the weight of 
the turbine casing and eliminates the need for brackets 
riveted onto the turbine casing so improving the 
integrity of the turbine casing.  According to the present invention a turbine 
assembly for a gas turbine engine comprises alternate 
annular arrays of rotor blades and stator vanes enclosed 
in an annular casing, each stator vane being secured at 
its radially outer extent to the casing, location means 
being provided which extend through the radially outer 
extent of the stator vane to locate the stator vane 
relative to the casing and prevent circumferential 
movement of the stator vane, the location means extending 
radially through the casing to engage an annular cooling 
duct which encloses the casing to define a cavity through 
which in operation cooling air passes. Preferably the radially outer extent of each stator 
vane is
