<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device which has been designed with the aid of a computer (1, 3) and to which there is detachably connected a data carrier (9, 10, 11) in which data describing the device are stored. The data carrier (9, 10, 11) is designed as an electronic mass storage means and, after separation from the device (2), can be read out by a further electronic device (13). In this way, all data concerning the device (2) can be kept available at a central location of the device (2).
