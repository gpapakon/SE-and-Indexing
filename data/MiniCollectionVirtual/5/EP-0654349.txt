Printing press with a device for automatically changing
printing plates, especially an offset sheet printing

press with a cassette vertically movable in front of a
printing unit as a protection (6) in front of the

printing unit, which serves for feeding a new printing
plate made ready in the cassette to the plate cylinder

(1) as well as for receiving a used printing plate from
the plate cylinder (1), wherein within the cassette (10,

11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22) constructed as protection
(6) in front of the printing unit, stops (16) are fitted

on to which a printing plate located in the protection
(6) can be deposited by its front edge, wherein below the

stops (16) of the cassette a guide unit (8, 9) which can
be set against the plate cylinder (1) is arranged, via

which by setting the guide unit (8, 9) against the plate
cylinder (1), the new printing plate is taken away from

the stops (16) and can be fed substantially tangentially
against the periphery of the plate cylinder (1), wherein

the guide unit (8, 9) is mounted swivellably about an
axis fixed with respect to the frame and running parallel

to the axis of the plate cylinder (1), wherein the guide
unit (8, 9) is fitted to a bending off bar (26), which

serves for bending off and introduction of the print end
edge of the printing plate and a pressing on roller (25)

mounted fast with respect to the frame which can be set
against the plate cylinder (1) is fitted, wherein the

bending off bar (26) is mounted movably with respect to
the pressing on roller (25).
Printing press according to Claim 1 wherein the cassette
(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22) forming the

protection (6) in front of the printing unit has two 
slots (21, 22) at the upper end of the protection (6),

wherein in each case one slot (21, 22) is provided for
receiving the new as well as the used printing plate.
Printing press according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the
stops (16) fitted in the cassette (10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

16, 18, 21, 22) within the protection (6) project through
openings within the guide unit (8, 9).
Printing press according to Claims 1 and 2 wherein fitted
at the slot (22) provided for the used printing plate is

a rubber lip (23) by which the printing plate is held
against the force of its own weight.
Printing press according to one of the preceding Claims
wherein additionally to the guide unit (8, 9) on the side

turned toward the plate cylinder (1), a further guide
surface (18) is provided via which a used printing plate

can be fed away.
