polypeptide (BNP), atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP)
and endothelin are known as important regulators in the  
cardiovascular system. It is assumed that BNP and ANP
participate in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte
metabolism regulation.In order to clarify the intricacies of circulation,
it is important that still unidentified vasoactive
peptides be discovered. Especially, hypotensive
peptides are desired which are useful in diagnosis and
treatment of hypertensive hypercardia and cardiac
failure.The peptide of this invention comprises an
