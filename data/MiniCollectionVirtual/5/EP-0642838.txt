<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a spray element (320), espacially for 
die sprayers, comprising a feed line (342) for fluid working 

medium, a feed line (346) for working air, and an atomizing 
device (380). The atomizing device (380) is connected to the 

feed line (342) for working medium and to the feed line (346) 
for working air, has a pivoting nozzle element (380d), and 

operates according to the external mixing principle. A 
section of the feed line (342) for working medium leading to 

the pivoting nozzle element (380d) is designed as a section 
of flexible tubing (380d).

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent pertains to a spray element, especially for mold sprayers,
comprising a feed line for fluid working medium and possibly a feed line for
control air; an atomizing device connected to the feed line for working
medium; and a switching valve, which can be controlled as a function of pressure,
with an elastically pretensioned valve body for the optional making or
breaking of the connection between the feed line for working medium and the
atomizer.Spray elements of this type are used in, for example, the spray tools of
the mold spray devices required between the cycles of die-casting, drop forging,
and other manufacturing operations involving the hot and cold working of
metals to prepare the parts of the die for the next sequence of operations.
For this purpose, the die is opened, and the spray tool is moved in between
the parts, which are then cleaned of metal residues, lubricant residues, and
other contaminants by the use of compressed air. They are then sprayed with a
lubricant and can also be cooled with water.Spray elements of the basic type in question are known, for example, from
U.S. Patents No. 4,714,199 and No. 4,365,754. In these spray elements, the
valve body of the switching valve consists of a piston. The piston is pretensioned
by a helical spring to keep the switching valve in the closed position,
and in this position the piston thus prevents fluid working medium from passing
through the switching valve and reaching the atomizer. According to what
has been said above, the spray elements known from U.S. Patents No. 4,714,199
and No. 4,365,754 have a complicated and, therefore, expensive design.Another spray element of the general type in question is known from U.S.
Patent No. 3,807,641. In this spray element, the valve body of the switching 
valve is formed by a flexible membrane, which is pretensioned by a piston,
which is itself pretensioned by a helical compression spring to keep the
switching valve in the closed position. As result, the spray element known
from U.S. Patent No. 3,807,641 also has a complicated and, therefore, expensive
design. The present invention pertains to a spray element, especially for
die sprayers, comprising a feed line for fluid working medium, a feed line for
working air, and an atomizer connected to the feed lines for working medium
and working air, a pivoting nozzle element being assigned to the atomizer.Spray elements of this type are known and are used, for example, in the
die sprayers of the applicant so that sprayers can be set up as effectively as
