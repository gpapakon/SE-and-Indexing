<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power conversion system, 
and more particularly to a voltage-type self-commutated 
conversion system such as a self-commutated reactive power 
compensator device which performs voltage control, reactive 
power control and so forth of power system and a self-commutated 
power conversion system which performs power 
interchange by means of DC transmission and frequency 
conversion. Figure 4, a diagram for the purpose of explaining the 
prior art, shows a voltage-type self-commutated power 
converter 1 (referred to simply as a converter below) which 
connects to an AC system 4 via a 3-phase system connection 
transformer 3, together with its-control devices. 2is a DC 
capacitor, 8, 9 and 10 are current transformers (CTs), 11 is 
a converter output voltage reference computation circuit, 12  
 
is a synchronization detection circuit, 13 is an active 
current setting device, 14 is a reactive current setting 
device, 15 is a PWM gate control circuit and 20 is a 
protection circuit for the converter 1. In Figure 4, the converter 1 is composed of self-turn-off 
devices GU, GV, GW, GX, GY and GZ, for example GTOs 
(gate turn-off thyristors), power transistors, static 
induction thyristors and other power electronic devices with 
self-turn-off function, together with diodes, DU, DV, DW, 
DX, DY and DZ connected respectively in anti-parallel with 
each self-turn-off device. Hereinafter, explanation will be given in the case 
where the converter 1 is operated as an inverter for 
converting DC input power into AC output power. The 3-phase 
output voltage of the converter 1 in a system with this kind 
of construction can be controlled by varying the conducting 
period of the self-turn-off devices, GU, GV, GW, GX, GY and 
GZ. The current received from or delivered to the AC system 
4 via the impedance of the system connection transformer 3 
is controlled by adjusting the phase angle and amplitude of 
the 3-phase output voltage of the converter 1 in accordance 
with the phase angle and amplitude of the system voltage VR, 
VS and VT of the AC system 4. By this means, the voltage-type 
self-commutated conversion system composed of the 
converter 1, the DC capacitor 2 and the system connection 
transformer 3 can either exchange active power with the AC  
 
system 4 by converting DC power to active power or 
compensate the reactive power of the AC system 4. The converter output voltage reference computation 
circuit 11, the synchronization detection circuit 12, the 
active current setting device
