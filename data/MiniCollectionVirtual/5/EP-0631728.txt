<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a procedure for comminuting 
the grains of cereal to be admixed to the 

feed of a single-stomach production animal, in particular 
a pig, the cereal grains being comminuted in a 

dry roll grinder into coarse particles so that more 
than 50% by weight of the comminuted cereal has particle 

size 1 to 5 mm and the cumulative pore volume of 
the particles in the range from 0.01 to 10 µm is 0.08 

to 0.2 cm³/g, so that with the cereal meal is achieved 
reduced effect damaging the digestive tract without 

incurring its impaired digestibility. 
The invention further concerns comminuted pig 
feed in which the cereal meal has been comminuted in a 

dry roll grinder for obtaining coarse particles of 
which more than 50% by weight have particle size 1 to 

5 mm, and the cumulative pore volume of particles in 
the range from 0.01 to 10 µm is 0.08 to 0.2 cm³/g.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a procedure
for comminuting grains of cereal to be admixed to the
feed of single-stomach production animals, in particular
pigs.Cereal is raw material commonly used in pig
feed. Grinding the grains of cereal to be admixed to
the feed has been found, according to general understanding,
to improve the utilization of cereal with
pigs of all ages. Studies relating to the effect of
grinding coarseness of cereal have revealed that better
growth results, generally considered, are achieved
with fine-ground feed. It has further been found that
the more finely divided the meal the larger is the
total surface area of the meal exposed to digestion
enzymes, and the better its digestibility.Present practice is generally to use in pig
feeds cereal processed in a hammer mill to fine-ground
state, in view of its good digestibility and good
granulability. Good growth results are obtained with
such feed, and it is therefore used in power-feeding
pigs.The problem is, however, that such feed used
in power feeding produces damage of various degrees in
the pigs' digestive tracts. Such damage includes gastric
ulcer, which has been found to be of two different
types: ulcer of the glandular part and of the nonglandular
part, and milder changes in the intestinal
wall, which may further progress to intestinal inflammation.
According to various studies serious changes
detrimental to the pig's comfort and well-being occur
in 10 to 20% of pigs. According to a Finnish investigation,
20% of the mortality of meat pigs are due to
gastric ulcer. Commonly, the most important cause responsible
for development of digestive tract damage is considered
to be the physical and chemical composition of
the feed. Other causes are various stress factors,
such as small pens, competition situation, humidity,
poor ventilation, long transport distances and/or prolonged
period in the slaughterhouse. Attempts have
been made to eliminate the problem by adding feed raw
material rich in fibre. But the problem could not be
solved by this approach. The utilizability of feed
produced in this way has been low and the effect on
productivity has likewise been low.The digestive tract-damaging effect of feed
such as is used at present has been estimated to be
due, in particular, to the finely divided cereal meal
contained in the feed.Various studies have shown the connection
between cereal grain particle size and gastric ulcer.
There is one study which reports increased fluidity of
the stomach contents caused by finely ground cereal,
