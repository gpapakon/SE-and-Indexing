<ABSTRACT>
An epidural oxygen sensor comprises a photodetector (24) 
and light emitting diodes (22) mounted at the end of a core 

of compressible foam (52) extending from the end of a hollow 
bone screw (40). As the bone screw is screwed into a burr 

hole in the skull, the photodetector and light emitting 
diodes will contact the dura and the foam will compress to 

maintain optical contact between the electrical components 
and the dura. Light from the diode is reflected by blood in 

the dura and brain, received by the photodetector, and the 
resultant electrical signals are processed by a pulse 

oximeter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sensors for determining the 
oxygen saturation of tissues within the skull and, in 
particular, to such sensors which are placed epidurally 
through the skull to measure oxygen saturation. During neurological and neurologically related surgical 
procedures it is oftentimes desirable to continuously 
monitor the oxygenation of blood which is supplied to the 
brain. Frequently access is gained to the brain through a 
borehole in the skull, and a sensor which measures 
oxygenation can then be inserted through such a borehole. 
A sensor should then exhibit numerous design and performance 
criteria in order to operate satisfactorily in this 
environment. The sensor must be capable of insertion 
through the borehole so as to contact tissue where oxygen 
saturation is to be measured. The sensor must be soft so 
that it does not damage neurological tissue, yet be 
sufficiently rigid in certain dimensions so that it can be 
maneuvered from outside the skull. It also must be sized to 
fit inside the borehole and in the location where 
measurements are to be taken. Furthermore, the sensor must 
be designed so as to eliminate detection of ambient light 
which will interfere with detection of the desired optical 
signals. The sensor must also prevent the detection of 
directly transmitted light from the light source of the 
sensor. The present invention provides an optical sensor for 
epidural measurement of blood oxygenation, as defined in 
claim 1. The sensor comprises a pair of light emitting 
diodes (LED's) which emit light at two predetermined 
wavelengths. The sensor also includes a photodetector for 
receiving light emitted by the LED's which has been 
reflected from adjacent blood perfused tissue. The LED's and photodetector are located in a hollow bone  
 
screw, with the components opposing the tissue from which 
measurements are to be taken. The components are backed by 
a soft polymer which will compress under gentle pressure as 
the bone screw is tightened to cause the components to 
contact the dura. In the drawings: 
Figures 1a to 1c are cross-sectional, top and bottom 
views of an epidural oxygenation sensor mounted in a hollow 
bone screw. Bone screw 40 is threaded as indicated at 44 to screw 
into the skull, and the head of the screw has a slot 42 to 
turn the screw with an adjustment instrument as more clearly 
shown in the top plan view of Figure 1b. A photodetector 24 
and a pair of LED's 22 are located at the bottom of a core 
of soft, compressible foam material 52 in
