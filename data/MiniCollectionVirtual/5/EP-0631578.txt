<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the stereoisomeric forms of itraconazole and
saperconazole, processes for preparing said stereoisomeric forms, the complexes thereof
with cyclodextrin derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said complexes
and methods of preparing said complexes and pharmaceutical compositions.Itraconazole or (±)-cis-4-[4-[4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-2-(1-methyl-propyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one,
is a broadspectrum antifungal compound
developed for oral, parenteral and topical use and is disclosed in US-4,267,179. Its
difluoro analog, saperconazole or (±)-cis-4-[4-[4-[4- [[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl-methyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-2-(1-methylpropyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one,
has improved activity
against Aspergillus spp. and is disclosed in US-4,916,134. Both compounds exist as a
mixture of four stereoisomers.
The development of efficaceous pharmaceutical compositions of itraconazole and
saperconazole is hampered considerably by the fact that said compounds are only very
sparingly soluble in water. The solubility of both compounds can be increased by
complexation with cyclodextrins or derivatives thereof as described in WO 85/02767
and US-4,764,604.Unexpectedly, it has now been found that each of the individual stereoisomers of
itraconazole and saperconazole have greater water solubility than the diastereomeric
mixtures of said compounds, in particular when complexed with cyclodextrin or its
derivatives. As a result, pharmaceutical compositions having good bioavailability, yet
comprising less cyclodextrin as a complexing agent, can be prepared. The present invention is concernced with the stereoisomeric forms of itraconazole
(X = Cl) and saperconazole (X = F), which may be represented by the formula

and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms thereof. The three asterisks
indicate the three chiral centers, and 'cis' means that the (1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)
moiety and the substituted phenoxy moiety are located at the same side of the plane
defined by the 1,3-dioxolane ring.The four possible stereoisomeric cis forms can be described using various rules of
nomenclature. The following tables show the correlation among the C.A. stereochemical
descriptor, the absolute configuration at each of the chiral centers and the specific optical
rotation [α] 20 / D in 1% methanol (itraconazole; table I)
