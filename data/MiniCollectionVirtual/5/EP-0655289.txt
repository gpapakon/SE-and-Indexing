<ABSTRACT>
A tool (22) for cutting grooves (20) in the barrel (12) of a 
writing instrument (10) having an external layer (18) of foamed or 

rubber-like material such as a thermoplastic elastomer, and 
an inner layer (16) of polypropylene or like material is applied 

to the circumference of the instrument barrel. The tool 
forms a circumferential groove (20) in the external layer (18) 

material, the groove (20) extending to the inner layer (16) and having 
substantially parallel sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting
tool as described in the preamble of claim 1 and as known for example
from DE-A-2 404 302. Furthermore it relates to the
method of employing the tool in the manufacturing
process of cutting a groove in the barrel of a writing instrument.It has become the practice in the manufacture
of writing instruments such as ball point pens and
mechanical pencils to employ a rubberized, in the form
of a thermoplastic elastomer (T.P.E.), material at the
grip portion of the writing instrument to provide the
user with a more comfortable and positive feel, when
employing the instrument. As it is further necessary
to provide a rigid structure to contain the refill or
ink container of a pen, or the mechanical mechanism of
a pencil, the rubberized, material is generally
provided as a laminate or coating material over a more
rigid structure formed of plastic material, such as
polypropylene.In addition to the employment of a softer
material for the user's grip, it has been found that
the formation of a plurality of grooves extending about
the periphery of the barrel is effective to provide the
user with a feeling of a more firmer grip, making the
instrument more acceptable than many instruments in the
prior art. In most instances the formation of grooves 
of this type has been accomplished by employing a saw-type instrument or
a knife-shaped tool. However the employment of such devices has a
tendency to cause rough edges about the opening of the groove into the
barrel and therefore presents a structure which is not pleasing to the eye,
and may be unacceptable commercially.French Patent 2,189,156 discloses a tool for cutting through a
workpiece in a single pass and for this purpose presents a cutting tip
having two raised cutting edges separated by an elongated channel which
extends along the top of the tool.The present invention is concerned with a tool for cutting a
groove in the barrel of a writing instrument having an external surface of
rubber-like material which provides for removal of the material from the
groove without subsequent fraying of the groove edges.The tool is intended for cutting a groove of the type mentioned
above which is simple in construction and may be easily employed in the
manufacture of a writing instrument barrel.The invention is also concerned with a method of forming a
groove in the barrel of a writing instrument having an external surface of
rubberized material which is simple to perform and provides a groove
having substantially parallel sides without

<CLAIMS>
A tool (22)
including a body member (23,51) having a cutting

portion (24) formed thereon, characterized in that the cutting portion has a
substantially flat upper surface (32,60) and a pair of outwardly facing side

surfaces (25,26) extending outwardly from said body member (23,51), each
surface terminating in a piercing edge (28,30) defining a piercing plane (P-P)

at its outermost extension, said piercing edges (28,30) lying in the same plane
as said substantially flat upper surface (32,60) and a recessed surface having a

forward cutting edge (33) disposed between said piercing edges (28, 30)
spaced from said piercing plane (P-P) and in the same plane as said

piercing edges (28,30) and substantially flat upper surface (32,60).
A tool according to claim 1, characterized in that said outwardly
facing side surfaces (25,26) are disposed inwardly toward said body

member (23,51) at an angle of approximately 3 degrees.
A tool according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that each
said piercing edge (28,30) is a maximum height at said piercing plane (P-P) and

decreases in height in a rearward direction.
A tool according to claim 3, characterized in that cutting portion
recessed surface and said side surfaces (25,26) extend rearwardly, downwardly

from said piercing plane (P-P).
A tool according to claim 3, characterized in that said outwardly
facing side surfaces (25,26) are disposed at a maximum lateral spacing at the

forward end of said cutting portion and converge at the rear of said
cutting portion.
A method of forming a groove in the barrel of a writing
instrument having an external surface of foamed material characterized by

the steps of providing a tool having the features according to any of the claims 1 to 5, 
rotating the barrel of the writing instrument and

bringing said tool into contact with the surface of the foamed material and
forcing the tool cutting portion into the foamed material to form a groove

having substantially parallel sides.
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that said writing
instrument barrel comprises an outer layer of rubber-like material and an

inner layer of rigid plastic and in that said tool is brought into contact with
said inner layer to remove substantially all of the outer layer material under

said tool cutting portion.
