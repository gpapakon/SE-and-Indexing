<ABSTRACT>
In processing alkali process condensate as waste water, the acid content is raised in the waste water flow by a stripping gas containing CO2 and then subjected to steam. The water taken from this cleaning stage contains ammonia and is free of salt formers. In a further stage, an acid gas containing NH3 is used to process the water. Also claimed is appts. with a raw gas feed, a gas washer, a gas cooler, a desulpherising stage and a clean gas wetting stage, together with a stripping tower (40), a stripping gas feed (12), an output zone (54), a steam heating zone (56), a sump (58) and a steam dome to take off the stripper vapour (33). Pref. the gas containing CO2 also acts as a desulphurising stage. The stripper gas contains more than 50 vol.% of CO2. The acid gas from the first cleaning stage is passed to a water operated quench cooler, where the water travels in a closed loop, and the outflow of waste water is fed before the first cleaning stage.

A process for the purification of alkaline process condensate
waste water from partial oxidation of carbonaceous fuels, wherein the

waste water to be purified is produced upon process gas cooling, in a
desulphurisation stage and/or in a pure gas wetting stage, characterised

in that the waste water flow is acidified with a stripping gas whose main
constituent is represented by CO
2
 and is then acted upon by means of a
steam flow in such a way that ammonia (NH
3
)-bearing water which is free
of salt-forming agent except for traces is taken from this purification

stage, wherein the acid gas which leaves said purification stage and
which still contains NH
3
 is fed to a further treatment.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the CO
2
-bearing
gas is taken from a desulphurisation stage.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
a gas of over 50% by volume CO
2
 is used as the stripping gas.
A process according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3 characterised
in that the acid gas from the first purification stage is treated in a

water-operated quench cooler.
A process according to claim 4 characterised in that the water
of the quench cooler is passed in a closed circuit, wherein the discharge

flow is fed to the waste water flow upstream of the first purification
stage.
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised
in that the vapours leaving the quench cooler are fed to a residue

washer, wherein the washing water leaving said washer are fed to the
process washing water flow and wherein the acid gas leaving said residue

washer is fed to the process gas flow downstream of the process gas
cooling step prior to the desulphurisation step. 
A process according to claim 1 or one of the following claims
characterised in that the waste water leaving the first purification

stage, which is ammonia-bearing but free from salt-forming agent, is fed
to further treatment stages, in particular an oxidation stage and an

ammonia-separation stage.
