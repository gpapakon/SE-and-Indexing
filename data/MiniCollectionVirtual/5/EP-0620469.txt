<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transparent coating on a 
transparent glass pane (12) which may be a laminated glass pane such 

as an automobile windshield. The present invention provides a 
two-layer coating (10) including a first layer (20) which is a 

transparent 
oxide film in direct contact with the major surface of the glass 

substrate (18) and a second layer (22) which is a transparent oxide film. 
The first layer (20) has a thickness of 70-230 nm and a refractive 

index of 1.80-2.10 and includes a major portion (26) and a minor 
portion (24) which is exposed and adapted to be used as a combiner of 

a head-up display system. The second layer (22) is formed on the 
major portion of the first layer (20) so as to expose the minor portion 

(24) of the first layer (20). The second layer (22) has a thickness 
of 110-130 

nm and a refractive index of 1.40-1.50. An additional film (54) is 
optionally formed on the minor portion (52) of the first layer (56) so 

as to 
fully or partly cover the minor portion (52). The additional layer 

(54) is 
adapted to be used as a wavelength-selective combiner of the 

head-up display system. The two-layer coating (10) except the minor 
portion (24) is adapted to be used as a reflectance reducing coating. 

To reduce the reflectance of perpendicularly incident light the 
two-layer coating (10) can be modified into a three-layer (28) coating by 

interposing another oxide film (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transparent glass pane 
having a reflectance reducing coating and a combiner of a head-up 
display system. In particular, the glass pane is to be used as a 
vehicular window glass that is installed in an inclined position as 
in the case of a current automobile windshield, and the coating 
serves to reduce reflectance of visible light obliquely incident on 
the coated side of the glass pane. There are various proposals of antireflection coatings for 
preventing or reducing the reflection of visible light from 
vehicular window glasses or windshields. As a coating for the antireflection purpose, it is known to 
use a fluoride film and/or a laminate of a plurality of transparent 
oxide films which have different refractive indices. For example, 
JP 61-189501 A (1986) shows a three-layer coating made up of a 
first layer which is in contact with the glass surface and formed 
of Al2O3 or CeF3 having a refractive index of 1.60-1.80, a second 
layer formed of a ZrO2/TiO2 mixture having a refractive index of 
1.95-2.15 and a third layer which is formed of MgF2 and has a 
refractive index of 1.30-1.45. JP 64-70701 A (1989) shows an 
antireflection three-layer coating which is electrically conductive 
and consists of a metal film coated on the glass surface as the 
first layer, a second layer which is a metal oxide film having a 
refractive index of 1.90-2.50 such as a TiO2 film and a third layer 
which has a refractive index of 1.35-1.50 and is formed of either 
SiO2 or MgF2. As a modified way of using a fluoride, JP 3-17601 
A (1991) proposes to form an antireflection coating by applying a 
solution of a metal oxide precursor such as a silicon alkoxide to a 
glass surface, heating the sol film on the glass surface to convert 
it into a gel film and further heating the gel film in a fluorine 
containing atmosphere to thereby form a metal oxide film 
containing fluoride of the metal.  
 However, for vehicular window glasses, fluoride containing 
coatings are generally insufficient in durability, and the use of 
fluorine or a fluoride often offers inconvenience to the industrial 
manufacturing operations. JP 4-357134 A (1992) shows a two-layer coating according to the preamble of claim 1 made up 
of a first oxide film which is in contact with the glass surface and 
has a thickness of 70-90 nm and a refractive index of 1.8-1.9 and 
an outer second oxide film which has a thickness of 110-130 nm 
and a refractive index of 1.4-1.5. JP 4-357135 A (1992) shows a 
three-layer coating
