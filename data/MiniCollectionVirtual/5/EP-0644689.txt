<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a television system wherein a 
plurality of VTRs are connected capable of the recording, 

display and the like of a channel which is not incorporated 
using one of tuners in the VTRs and a television set 

thereof. 
A table listing the tuners incorporated in the 
television set and VTRs connected thereto is created, and 

the switching, recording and display of a channel of the 
television set is performed based on the table. By mapping 

channels which can be actually used, the usable channels can 
be quickly selected and picked up.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television set
such as one for a television system of the shared tuner
system type, said system being comprised of one
television set and one or more apparatuses such as a VTR
connected thereto wherein a tuner incorporated in the
television set or one of the apparatuses is shared by all
the apparatuses in the system to allow an apparatus which
does not have a tuner adapted to a desired channel to
perform recording on the channel and to allow an apparatus
having no tuner to perform recording.Conventional VTRs incorporate a tuner for timed
recording (recording at a preset time), and such a tuner is
generally remotely controlled using a remote controller in
accordance with steps for timed recording defined for each
type of VTR.It has recently become popular in more and more
homes to use a VTR incorporating a tuner capable of
recording a satellite broadcast and a VTR which does not
have such a tuner by connecting them to a single television
set.Fig. 11 of the accompanying drawings shows a
conventional recording/reproducing system having a
configuration wherein three stationary VTRs 31, 32 and 33 and
a VTR 34 with a camera are connected to a television set 35.The stationary VTRs 31, 32 and 33 have input
terminals IN1 and IN2, output terminals OUT1 and OUT2 and a
monitor terminal M.The input and output terminals of each stationary
VTR are respectively connected to the output and input
terminals of the remaining two stationary VTRs in a
one-to-one relationship. In Fig. 11, cables for picture
signals, right audio signals and left audio signals are
represented by a single solid line. Hereinafter, those
cables are collectively referred to as video cables. The above-described connection of the stationary
VTRs 31, 32 and 33 allows pictures or the like from one VTR
to be transmitted to other VTRs for recording etc.For example, if the VTR 31 incorporates a tuner
for a broadcast satellite channel and the VTR 32 does not
incorporate the same, pictures over the BS channel can be
recorded into the VTR 32 through the VTR 31 by performing a
series of operations, i.e., the operations of turning on the
power supply of the VTR 31, switching the output of the VTR
31 to the VTR 32, switching the tuner of the VTR 31, turning
on the power supply of the VTR 32, switching the input of
the VTR 32 to the VTR 31 and starting recording at the VTR
32.The monitor terminals M of the stationary VTRs 31,
32 and 33 are connected to separate input terminals of the
television set 35 by the video cables. Such
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A television set (5) which can be connected to at
least one video apparatus (1, 2, 3, 4), said television

set (5) comprising:

an internal tuner (22);
a picture signal processing portion (27);
a channel selection means (11) for selecting a
channel;
a tuner selection means (9) for selecting any one of
the internal tuner (22) and the tuner incorporated in

said at least one video apparatus (1, 2, 3, 4) when
connected to said television set (5) as a tuner to

receive the channel selected by said channel selection
means (11); and
a supply means (23, 24, 25, 26) for supplying the
output of said selected tuner to said picture signal

processing portion (27) and/or said at least one video
apparatus (1, 2, 3, 4) connected thereto;

characterized by further comprising a storage means
(21) for storing information (28) on channels available

via said internal tuner (22) and channels available from
tuners incorporated in said video apparatuses (1, 2, 3,

4) connected thereto, wherein said channel selection is
performed according to the information (28) on the

available channels stored in said storage means (21), and
wherein said tuner selection means (9) is arranged to

select automatically, in response to the channel selected
by a user, an appropriate one of said tuners according to

the information on the available channels stored in said
storage means (21).
