<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the mounting of condensers (18) 
for steam turbines (16) which are supported on a turbine 

foundation (10), holding points having holders or 
recesses (26) for holding means (24) being provided on 

the turbine foundation (10) outside the base area 
required for the steam turbine (16), characterized in 

that the holding means (24) are designed in such a way 
that they hold the condenser (18) in its mounted position 

for the duration of the mounting of the turbine (16) and 
can be removed after mounting has been effected. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the holding means (24) are tie rods which are 

fastened to the so-called condenser neck (20). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the holding means (24) are ropes which are 

fastened to the so-called condenser neck (20). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the holding means (24) are chains which are 

fastened to the so-called condenser neck (20). 
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that special connection points 

(28) for the holding means (24) are provided on the 
condenser (18).
