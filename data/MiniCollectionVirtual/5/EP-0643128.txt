<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous
fabric softener composition, i.e., a liquid softener
composition, which can impart an excellent softness
and elasticity (fluffiness) to various fibers, and is
excellent in storage stability over a wide range of
temperature. Further, the present invention relates
to quaternary ammonium salts which are useful as a
base of the above-mentioned aqueous fabric softener
composition and are not detrimental to the natural
environment because of their excellent biodegradability,
and a process for the preparation thereof.
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a use of
the quaternary ammonium salts, and a method for
imparting softness and elasticity to fibers which
comprises using the quaternary ammonium salts.Fabric softeners for domestic use at the present
time are generally in the form of a composition
comprising di(hardened beef tallow alkyl) dimethyl 
ammonium chloride as the main component. The reason
this quaternary ammonium salt is used as the main
component in fabric softeners for domestic use is that
the salt exerts an excellent softening effect on
various fibers even when used in a small amount.Although the above-mentioned quaternary ammonium
salt exerts an excellent softening effect, it
sometimes deteriorates the elasticity of fibers, in
particular, cotton and thus imparts an oily hand to
the fabrics when applied at a high concentration in
order to further elevate the softening effect.
Further, when stored for a long period of time, a
fabric softener composition comprising the above-mentioned
quaternary ammonium salt is easily
thickened, gels or separates out in some cases due to
its physicochemical properties.Furthermore, there is a disadvantage that a
quaternary ammonium salt having two long-chain alkyl
groups, such as the above-mentioned di(hardened beef
tallow alkyl)dimethylammonium chloride, has poor
biodegradability.Attempts have been made to eliminate or reduce
these disadvantages of the conventional fabric
softeners for domestic use and the conventional
quaternary ammonium salts, which are a main component 
of the fabric softeners, by introducing an ester group
or an amido group between a quaternary nitrogen atom
and a long-chain alkyl group. For example, European
Patent Publication-A No. 472,178 (published on Feb.
26, 1992) and U.S. Patent No. 5,282,983 (assignee: Kao
Corp.; date of patent: Feb. 1, 1994) corresponding
thereto have disclosed a fabric softener composition
comprising a di(long-chain alkyl) quaternary ammonium
salt having ester
