<ABSTRACT>
A thermally-actuated steam trap comprises a valve casing 
having an inlet (4), a valve chest (3) and an outlet (5). 

A valve seat member (7) with a discharge passage (8) is 
disposed between the valve chest (3) and the outlet (5). A 

temperature control element (9) with an expansible medium 
(15) sealed therein is disposed within the valve chest (3), 

and consists of two disk-shaped wall members (11,19), at 
least one wave-like diaphragm member (14,18) provided 

between the wall members (11,19)) and a valve member (16) 
secured to the diaphragm member (18). Displacement of the 

diaphragm (14) accompanying the expansion and contraction 
of the expansible medium (15) causes the valve member (16) 

to come into and out of a seating engagement with the valve 
seat member (7) to close and open the discharge passage. 

In order to avoid a state of producing a permanent 
deformation of the diaphragm of low elastic material and 

not to be affected by repeated use of the diaphragm, the 
upper surface of the lower disk-shaped wall member (19) has  

 
a curved region corresponding to the wave form of the 

diaphragm member (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steam trap for 
automatically discharging condensate generated in various 
kinds of steam using equipment and steam pipe lines, and, 
more particularly, to a thermally-actuated steam trap 
adapted to discharge the condensate below a desired 
temperature out of a system by using a temperature control 
element including a medium which is heated and expanded by 
steam and cooled and contracted by condensate. Such a thermally-actuated steam trap is provided with a 
body having therein a valve chest in which steam or 
condensate is introduced and a temperature control element 
disposed in the valve chest. The temperature control 
element used for such a steam trap comprises two disk-like 
wall members, an upper one and a lower one, and at least 
one diaphragm provided between the two wall members, the 
diaphragm being secured at its outer peripheral edge to 
both the wall members, and the inner space formed between 
the upper wall member and diaphragm accomodating an 
expansible medium which changes in volume corresponding to  
 
the temperature. When the valve is open, the upper 
surface of the diaphragm and the lower surface of the 
upper wall member are brought in contact in a location 
different from the location where the peripheral walls 
of the at least one diaphragm member is sandwiched 
between the upper and lower wall members and secured 
thereto. Further, on the diaphragm at the side opposite 
the expansible medium side is carried a valve member. In the termally-actuated steam trap having such a 
temperature control element disposed in the valve 
chest, an inflow of steam at a high temperature in 
the valve chest causes the expansible medium to expand, 
thereby displacing the diaphragm in the direction of 
closing the valve, so that the valve member carried by 
the diaphragm is brought into a seating engagement with 
the valve seat member connected to the outlet, and 
accordingly, a discharge passage formed in the valve 
seat member is closed. This prevents the discharge of 
steam. On the other hand, an inflow of condensate at a 
low temperature in the valve chest causes the 
expansible medium to contract, thereby displacing the 
diaphragm in the direction of opening the valve, so 
that the valve member is brought out of a seating 
engagement with the valve seat member to open the 
discharge passage, thereby discharging the condensate 
out of the system.  
 In the thermally-actuated steam trap as constructed above, 
since the valve member secured to the diaphragm

<CLAIMS>
A thermally-actuated steam trap comprising: 

a valve casing having an inlet (4), a valve chest (3) 
and an outlet (5); 
a valve seat member (7) disposed between said valve 
chest (3) and said outlet (5) and having a discharge 

passage (8); 
a temperature control element (9) disposed within said 
valve chest (3), having an expansible medium (15) 

sealed therein and including 

(i) two disk-shaped wall members, an upper one (11) 
and a lower one (19), 
(ii) at least one wave-like diaphragm member (14,18) 
provided between said wall members (11,19), and 
(iii) a valve member (16) secured to said diaphragm 
member (14); 
 
whereby, when the valve is open, the upper surface of 

the diaphragm member (14) and the lower surface of the 
upper wall member (11) are brought in contact in a 

location different from the location where the 
peripheral walls of the diaphragm member (14,18) is 

sandwiched between the upper and lower wall members 
(11,19) and secured thereto; 
characterized in that
 
said lower disk-shaped wall member (19) has an upper 

surface having a curved region corresponding to the 
configuration of the wave of said diaphragm member 

(18), so that said diaphragm member (18) and said lower 
wall member (19) are substantially brought into close 

contact with each other when the expansible medium (15) 
excessively expands.  

 
A thermally-actuated steam trap according to claim 1, 
further comprising an elastic member (26) for pressing said 

temperature control element (9) toward said valve seat 
member (7).
