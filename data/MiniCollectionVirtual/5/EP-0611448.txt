<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rheometers for analyzing the 
behavior of thin liquid films and more particularly to rheometers for 
measuring viscoelastic properties of liquids. Viscoelastic properties are important in predicting how a liquid 
will behave under stress. Knowing these properties is becoming 
increasingly important as industry is starting to use polymer additives 
in liquid products. Rheometers typically determine viscoelastic properties by 
shearing a liquid sample between plates. The plates are separated by a 
fixed gap. One plate moves relative to the other by sliding or rotating. 
The invention uses normal oscillations of a sample between parallel 
plates to determine viscoelastic properties. This approach accurately 
characterizes liquids with a wide range of viscosity. The technique is 
inherently simpler to implement at a significantly lower cost relative to 
prior art rheometers.  
 It is an object of the present invention to inexpensively, easily, 
and accurately measure the viscoelastic properties of fluids by normally 
oscillating a small liquid sample between two parallel, circular plates. It is a further object of the present invention to measure G' and 
G", the storage and loss moduli of viscoelastic fluids. To achieve the foregoing objects, there is disclosed an oscillatory 
squeezing flow rheometer as claimed in claim 3. Also to achieve the foregoing objects, there is disclosed a method 
of determining viscoelastic properties of liquids comprising the steps of 
placing a liquid circularly between and in contact with parallel plates, 
sinusoidally oscillating one of the plates in a direction normal to the 
other plate, measuring the radius of the fluid circle, measuring the 
force of the oscillations, measuring the displacement of the moving 
plate, measuring the mean distance between the plates, measuring the 
frequency of the oscillations, and determining fluid properties base on 
those measurements. Also to achieve the foregoing objects, there is disclosed a method 
of determining G', the storage modulus, and G", the loss modulus, of 
non-Newtonian fluids comprising the steps of placing a liquid circularly 
between and in contact with parallel plates; measuring the radius of the 
fluid circle; measuring the mean distance between the plates; applying a 
sinusoidally oscillating force to one of the plates in a direction normal  
 
to the other plate, the force oscillations having a force amplitude and a 
frequency; measuring the force amplitude; measuring the frequency;
