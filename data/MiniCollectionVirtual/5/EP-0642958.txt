<ABSTRACT>
An inertial trigger mechanism (10) for a vehicle safety device, e.g. 
the gas generator of a seat belt pre-tensioner, is provided with a 

safety lever (50) to prevent triggering of the device. The mechanism 
(10) also comprises: a detonator (42); an ignition pin (22), urged 

towards the detonator (42) by a spring (28); a mass (30) and its 
biassing spring (32); a pivotable trigger lever (34) which holds the pin 

(22) in position with a hook arrangement (38) and is prevented from 
pivoting by contact (40) with the mass (30). During sudden deceleration, 

the mass (30) moves relative to its casing (12) allowing the trigger 
lever (34) to pivot so releasing the ignition pin (22). However, when 

the safety lever (50) is engaged, e.g. during calibration, the trigger 
lever (34) cannot pivot, and the ignition pin (22) is immobilised even 

if the mass (30) moves. Push-type and rotation-type safety levers are 
proposed. In the former, the lever (50) is moved into engagement by 

linear movement of the lever (50,54,A); in the latter this is achieved 
by rotation of the lever shaft (52) to bring the safety lever (54) into 

engagement with the trigger lever (41).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanical ignition 
sensor for sensing a state of a sudden deceleration of a 
vehicle or the like. As a seat belt system mounted to a vehicle, there is 
known, for example, one provided with a so-called 
pretensioner wherein a webbing applied to an occupant is 
retracted a predetermined amount when the vehicle suddenly 
decelerates. The looseness of the webbing applied to the 
occupant is thus forcibly removed so as to tighten the 
webbing to thereby improve occupant-restraining 
characteristics. With this type of pretensioner, there is known one 
wherein a take-up shaft of a webbing retractor is forcibly 
rotated so as to tighten a webbing and one wherein a buckle 
is forcibly pulled so as to tighten a webbing. For example, 
the latter pretensioner is provided with a gas generator 
having a mechanical ignition sensor. A cylinder is attached 
to the gas generator and coupled to a buckle via a wire or 
the like. When the vehicle suddenly decelerates, a state of a  
 
sudden deceleration is detected by the mechanical ignition 
sensor and the gas generator is operated to instantaneously 
generate gas. As a result, the cylinder which generated the 
gas is moved and the resultant moving force is transmitted 
to the buckle via the wire so as to forcibly move the 
buckle, thereby tightening the webbing. The mechanical ignition sensor employed in such 
pretensioner basically comprises an ignition pin for 
igniting a detonator, an inertial body, which is inertially 
moved by a large acceleration, and a trigger member, which 
is interposed between the ignition pin and the inertial body 
so as to prevent the ignition pin from moving. Further, a 
safety device is provided thereat for preventing a 
malfunction of the mechanical ignition sensor when the 
sensor is assembled to the vehicle or the like. The safety device includes a safety lever, which 
engages the inertial body moved by the inertial force and 
prevents the movement of the inertial body regardless of the 
operation of the inertial force. When the safety lever 
engages the inertial body, the movement of the inertial body 
is forcibly prevented as described above. Accordingly, even 
if external force is unnecessarily applied to the vehicle 
when the safety lever is assembled thereto, the 
malfunctioning of the sensor is prevented. The safety device (the safety lever) of the  
 
conventional mechanical ignition sensor having the 
aforementioned structure must be reliably operated, and the 
operation thereof must be
