<ABSTRACT>
Control of a fuel quantity and an air 

quantity delivered to an exhaust gas heater (16) is 
provided by determining a desired heater air quantity 

and a desired heater air/fuel ratio both of which may 
vary over multiple control states, by commanding an 

air rate in accordance with the desired heater air 
quantity, by adjusting the commanded air quantity in 

accordance with a sensed actual air quantity, and by 
commanding a fuel quantity in accordance with the 

desired heater air/fuel ratio and either the desired 
heater air quantity or the sensed actual air quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal 
combustion engine emission control and, more 
particularly, to a method of controlling of an exhaust 
gas heater. EP-A-0270277 discloses a heater for the 
passenger compartment of a motor vehicle which has a 
fuel burner supplied with combustion air by a blower. 
Combustion is controlled by a flame sensor which sends 
signals to a control unit which controls a fuel 
atomiser, a fuel supply valve, an ignition glow plug 
and the blower. Engine exhaust gas may be passed through a 
catalyst treatment device called a catalytic 
converter, to reduce emission of undesirable exhaust 
gas constituents, such as hydrocarbons, carbon 
monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. To become 
catalytically active following a cold start of the 
engine, catalytic converters rely on heat energy in 
the exhaust gas passing therethrough. Initiation of 
catalyst activity occurs at converter light-off 
temperature, which is typically around 400 degrees 
Celsius. Following a cold start, the engine may have 
to operate for over 100 seconds before heat energy 
transferred from the engine exhaust to the converter 
elevates the converter temperature to light-off, such 
that efficient conversion may occur. To reduce the period of time before the 
light-off temperature is reached after a cold start, 
exhaust gas heating devices may be provided to 
introduce additional heat energy in the engine exhaust 
gas path after a cold start. Heaters have been 
considered for exhaust gas heating in which an 
air/fuel mixture is combusted and the combustion heat 
energy therefrom drawn into the engine exhaust gas  
 
path. To minimise the time to catalyst light-off, 
such heaters must be ignited as soon as possible after 
a start time, and once ignited, must be operated in a 
manner wherein maximum heat energy is transferred to 
the engine exhaust path and ultimately to the 
catalytic converter.  
 To provide for rapid heater ignition, it has 
been proposed to apply open loop control to a rate at 
which air and fuel are admitted to the heater until 
such time as ignition is detected in the heater. Open 
loop control of fuel and air are continued after 
ignition is detected in such an approach, for a period 
of time until catalytic converter temperature has been 
increased to a desirable temperature, and maintained 
at that temperature for a period of time after which 
it may be assumed that converter temperature may be 
maintained solely through engine exhaust gas heat 
energy transfer. The conditions under which

A method of controlling an exhaust gas 
heater (16) comprising the steps of providing for 

combustion in the exhaust gas heater by setting a 
desired air quantity to a predetermined lighting air 

quantity and by setting a desired heater air/fuel 
ratio to a predetermined lighting air/fuel ratio; 

sensing combustion in the exhaust gas heater; 
providing for a rapid increase in heater energy output 

upon sensing combustion in the exhaust gas heater by 
setting the desired air quantity to a predetermined 

ramp air quantity and setting the desired heater 
air/fuel ratio to a predetermined ramp air/fuel ratio; 

adjusting a commanded air quantity admitted to the 
exhaust gas heater in accordance with the set desired

quantity admitted to the exhaust gas heater in 

accordance with the set desired heater air/fuel ratio 
and a predetermined one of the set desired air 

quantity and the adjusted commanded air quantity. 
A method according to claim 1, further 
comprising the steps of estimating when heater energy 

output has reached a predetermined maximum output; and 
stabilising exhaust gas temperature when heater output 

energy is estimated to have reached the predetermined 
maximum output, by setting the desired air quantity to 

a predetermined hold air quantity and setting the 
desired heater air/fuel ratio to a predetermined hold 

air/fuel ratio. 
A method according to claim 2, further 
comprising the step of enleaning an air/fuel ratio in 

exhaust gas heated by the exhaust gas heater (16) by 
setting the desired air quantity to a predetermined 

enleanment air quantity and setting the desired  
 

air/fuel ratio to a predetermined enleanment air/fuel 
ratio.

actual air quantity admitted to the exhaust gas heater

the set desired air quantity and the sensed actual air 
quantity; and determining an air correction value as a 

predetermined function of the determined air error; 
wherein the commanded air quantity is adjusted by the 

determined air correction value; and wherein the 
commanded fuel vapour quantity is adjusted by 

determining a desired quantity of fuel vapour to be 
admitted to the exhaust gas heater as the quantity of 

fuel vapour needed, for a predetermined air quantity 
selected from the set including the set desired air 

quantity and the sensed actual air quantity, to drive 
an actual heater air/fuel ratio toward the set desired 

heater air/fuel ratio; and generating a fuel vapour 
command as a predetermined function of the desired 

quantity of fuel vapour. 
A method according to any one of claims 
1 to 4, further comprising the steps of estimating a

1 to 5, further comprising the steps of sensing when 

combustion is not present in the exhaust gas heater 
(16); and stopping admission of the commanded fuel 

vapour quantity to the exhaust gas heater upon sensing 
that combustion is not present.
