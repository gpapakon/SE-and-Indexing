<ABSTRACT>
A preamplifier circuit arrangement for a magnetic or magneto resistive transducer, 
such as a record/replay head, in which a cascode preamplifier stage, and a stage providing 

a floating reference voltage for a following amplifier, are linked by an emitter coupled pair 
of transistors, one in each stage, such that the d.c. currents in the two stages flow in 

common through the transducer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to preamplifier circuit arrangements, and in particular
to preamplifier circuit arrangements for use with magnetic or magneto resistive transducer
or record/replay heads.Such magnetic or magneto-resistive heads commonly require a relatively high bias
current in order to develop a usable output signal, and this requirement is in conflict with
the desirability of keeping down the current levels and hence power dissipation in the
preamplifier circuit arrangements to which the heads are connected.A prior art magnetic record reproducing system preamplifier is known from US-A-4 159 489.
EP-A-0 283 593 discloses a Videoamplifier having a similar structure to that of the preamplifier shown in the accompanying drawing.According to the present invention a preamplifier circuit arrangement for a
magnetic or magneto resistive transducer or record/replay head comprises an emitter-coupled
pair of transistors having respective constant current sources in their collector
circuits and bias circuit means to apply d.c. biases to their respective bases, means to
connect said transducer or record/replay head between said coupled emitters and a point
of ground potential, and means to connect one of said pair of transistors in common base
mode to alternating signal currents flowing in said transducer or record/replay head, the
arrangement being such that alternating output signals may be derived from the collector
circuit of said one of said pair of transistors.Preferably the collector circuits of said emitter-coupled pair of transistors are
connected to respective inputs of an amplifier providing differential output signals.A preamplifier circuit arrangement in accordance with the present invention will
now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing, which
shows the arrangement diagrammatically. Referring to the drawing any one of four magneto resistive heads 1 to 4 may be
selected to receive a constant bias current I1 + I2 from sources 5 and 6 in dependence upon
which of four transistors T5 to T8 is biassed into conduction by a head select circuit 7.
The bias current sources 5 and 6 are connected in the collector circuits of an emitter
coupled pair of transistors T3 and T4, the d.c. bias conditions of which are fixed by a
biassing circuit comprising transistors T1 and T2 and resistors R1 to R4.By means of a capacitor C connected between the base of transistor T4 and ground
transistor T4 is arranged to operate in common base mode with respect to any alternating
curre
