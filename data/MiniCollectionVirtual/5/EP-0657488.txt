<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a thermoplastic copolymer powder with high 
bulk specific gravity. It is desirable that thermoplastic resin 
powder has high bulk specific gravity in view of efficient 
utilization of the storage space of the powder as 
a product and incidental reduction of its transportation 
cost. Hitherto, many studies have been made on the 
method for elevating bulk specific gravity of thermoplastic 
resin powder. For example, many researches have 
been conducted on means for improving powder properties 
of the powdery or granular polymers recovered from graft 
copolymer latices containing an elastomeric backbone 
polymer in a high ratio. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 
4,897,462 discloses a method for carrying out slow 
coagulation of a polymer latex in the presence of a 
coagulant of a specific concentration. Also, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,275,178 discloses a method for improving 
the powder properties such as bulk specific gravity and 
blocking resistance of the produced coagulated slurries  
 
or dry powders by adding a hard polymer thereto. The former method characterized by the slow 
coagulation in the presence of a coagulant of a specific 
concentration is capable of providing a spherical powder 
with a narrow particle size distribution, but it has 
disadvantages in that because of high water content of 
the powder after dehydration, when a heat treatment is 
carried out at a high temperature during solidification 
for obtaining the solid particles, the fine individual 
particles in the coagulated particles may be fused 
together without compacted sufficiently, making it 
unable to obtain the coagulated particles with high 
density and, consequently there can not be obtained the 
particles of high bulk specific gravity. The latter method characterized by the 
addition of a hard polymer for improving the powder 
properties is designed to elevate bulk specific gravity 
of the powder by densifying the filled structure of the 
coagulated particle agglomerates by such means as 
cohesion of the coagulated particles, but this method 
has the problem that the effect of improving the density 
of the coagulated particles themselves can not be 
expected and a powder with a well satisfactory bulk 
specific gravity can not be obtained. The present inventors have pursued further 
studies with a view to solving the above problems and, 
as a result, found that a polymer powder with a high 
bulk specific gravity comprising the compacted particles  
 
can be obtained by adding
