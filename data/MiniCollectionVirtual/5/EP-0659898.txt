<ABSTRACT>
A molten metal atomization ring structure 
has an elongated or oval aperture therethrough through 

which a molten metal stream passes and is broken up 
into a molten metal spray pattern. The structure may 

be angularly adjusted about a transverse axis of the 
aperture at a greater angle without engaging the 

passing metal stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
molten metal spray forming atomizer,
and more particularly to such an atomizer particularly
adapted for spray forming of a refined molten metal
from a molten metal refining or melting chamber. A
molten metal spray forming atomizer is employed to
convert a small molten metal stream from the melt
chamber into an expanding metal spray or plume of
small molten metal droplets which impinge and deposit
on an appropriate collector to provide a large metal
billet or other object of desired metal
characteristics.One example of molten metal refining is
referred to as electroslag refining, and is
illustrated and described in U.S. Patent 5,160,532 -
Benz et al, assigned to the same assignee as the
present invention.In an electroslag process, a large ingot of
a preferred metal may be effectively refined in a
molten state to remove important impurities such as
oxides and sulfides which may have been present in the
ingot. Simply described, electroslag refining
comprises a metal ingot positioned over a pool of
molten ingot metal in a suitable vessel or furnace
where the molten metal pool includes a surface layer
of solid slag, an adjacent underlayer of molten slag
and a lowermost body of refined molten ingot metal.
The ingot is connected as an electrode in an
electrical circuit including the molten metal pool, a
source of electrical power and the ingot. The ingot 
is brought into contact with the molten slag layer and
a heavy electrical current is caused to flow across
the ingot/molten slag interface. This arrangement and
process causes electrical resistance heating and
melting of the ingot at the noted interface with the
molten ingot metal passing through the molten slag
layer as a refining medium to then become a part of
the body of refined ingot metal. It is the
combination of the controlled resistance melting and
the passage of molten ingot metal through the molten
slag layer which refines the ingot metal to remove
impurities such as oxides, sulfides, and other
undesirable inclusions.In metal spray forming, a small stream of
refined molten metal from the furnace is caused to
pass concentrically through a molten metal spray
forming atomizer generally comprising a closed
peripheral manifold about a central aperture. The
manifold is equipped with gas inlet means and plural
gas jet exit means. An inert gas under pressure is
supplied to the manifold to exit through the gas jets
in converging streams which impinge the passing metal
stream to convert or break up the metal stream into

<CLAIMS>
A molten metal spray forming atomizer (31)
comprising:


a peripheral non-circular manifold defining an
aperture (32) having a center through the manifold

adapted to pass a molten metal (22) stream through the
aperture, the manifold having gas jets positioned therein

surrounding the aperture at different radial dimensions
from the center of the aperture, the manifold being

adapted to receive a gas therein under pressure and to
direct the gas (27) through the gas jets to engage the

molten metal stream after the molten metal stream has
passed through the aperture so that the metal stream is

atomized into a spray pattern of metal droplets; and
mounting means (30) for angular adjustment rotation
of the atomizer about a transverse axis of the aperture.
The atomizer of claim 1 wherein the different
radial dimensions define an aperture having a major and

minor axis which provides a greater metal stream
clearance along the major axis than along the minor axes.
The atomizer of claim 1 wherein the different
radial dimensions define an oval aperture.
The atomizer of claim 1 wherein the different
radial dimensions define an elliptical aperture.
The atomizer of claim 1 wherein the mounting
means comprise at least one hollow shaft (33) operatively

connected to the manifold in gas flow relationship to
supply a gas to the manifold and the gas jets.
The atomizer of claim 4 wherein the aperture is
elliptical and the manifold is mounted for transverse

rotation about the minor axis of the elliptical aperture.
An electroslag refining assembly system including a
reservoir of molten metal and an exit orifice in the 

reservoir through which a molten metal stream exits from
the reservoir, and a spray forming atomizer adapted to

receive and encircle the molten metal stream, the
atomizer being in accordance with any one of claims 1 to
