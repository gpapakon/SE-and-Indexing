<ABSTRACT>
A child seat for arrangement in the direction of travel or counter to the direction of travel on a seat of a vehicle comprises a seat shell, a base and an attachment and adjusting device. In order to shift the centre of gravity of the child seat and of a child sitting in the seat as far as possible downwards, the seat shell is arranged such that it can be displaced in the direction of travel in relation to the base. The seat shell can be inclined in relation to the base irrespective of its displacement in the direction of travel.
