is reduced to 


 
wherein:

 
P = concentrated load (in the middle point),

 
l= bar length (considered as a restrained beam),

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and means for dynamically 
spanning the guiding bars in a tile cutting machine of the kind comprising a 
bridge guide including such bars in the form of two parallel beam-like rods 
providing a guide for a scoring tool carrier (cf. FR-A-2 497 533), 
wherein said scoring tool carrier is 
shiftably mounted in the groove comprised by said parallel beam-like rods in 
order to be guided thereby as well as to keep them duly spaced apart. At the present state of the art the pair of bars guiding the carrier of disc 
like carbide tool, for scoring ceramic tiles, in tile cutting machines, 
particularly when the same bars are rectangular in cross-section, with their 
long side in vertical attitude, are in all cases exclusively supported at their 
ends. Whereas, mainly in the middle section of the bars, they are lacking of 
transverse strength in a direction perpendicular to the main side thereof. Indeed, the working strains are directed mainly in substantially the 
vertical direction, direction in which, with advantage ratios between four and 
ten times, the power applied is in the order of several tenth of Kgs. This power is intended to endow the scoring. Whereas, the scoring quality 
is strongly dependant from the transverse strength of tool carrier guides or tool 
carrier guiding bars. In conventional conditions the tool carrier guides or bars  
 
never work together. As a consequence, when the tool carrier is driven to 
perform the scoring stroke, the side clearances and deformations provided by 
transverse thrusts in both opposite directions, result in poor and inaccurate 
scorings, which in turn result in cuts of bad quality. Particularly unstable is the movement of tool carrier of the push kind. In 
practice the control stick of the tool carrier becomes liable to swing, whereby 
the other end thereof, carrying the disk-like tool, is correspondingly unstable. 
Thus the carbide tool, which is the most critical member is unduly forced, 
whereby its effectiveness and life are heavily reduced. And more than that, the 
two effects of unstableness increased each other. Moreover with the wear of the machine and/or lack of sturdiness of various 
members the carbide tool consume results to be higher while the scoring and 
therefore the corresponding cut result to be poor and inaccurate and the tile 
waste increased. For endeavouring to go beyond this drawback, sometimes it 
was preferred to provide complicated and or heavy and/or cumbersome 
arrangements such those disclosed

<CLAIMS>
A tile scoring machine for scoring ceramic tiles comprising: 

two parallel beam-like bars (2, 2'), 
a bridge member (3, 3', 3'', 1) disposed on said bars (2, 2'), 
a tool carrier (1) supported and/or comprised by said bridge member (3, 3', 
3'', 1) and having at one end a tile scoring tool 
wherein said scoring tool carrier (1) is shiftably mounted between said bars (2. 
2') in order to be guided thereby as well as to keep said bars (2. 2') duly spaced 

apart, 
 
characterized in that 


a pair of opposed antagonist members (31, 32; 31', 32'; 31'', 32'') are connected 
to said bridge (3, 3', 3'' 1), each antagonist member (31, 32; 31', 32'; 31'', 32'') 

being disposed laterally on a side of the respective bar (2, 2') so as to restrain 
said bars (2, 2') and thereby prevent lateral deflections of the bars when the tile 

scoring and/or cutting machine is being used, whereby the camber in the 
direction of restraint is reduced from

in the restrained condition, wherein: 


P = concentrated load applied midway along said bars (2, 2'); 
l= bar length when the bar (2, 2') is considered as a restrained beam; 
l'= distance between the device and the load point; 
l''= distance between the device and the load point and the nearest bar fixed 
end; 
E=Modulus of the bar material; 
I=Moment of inertia of the bar (2, 2'). 
A tile scoring machine as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said 
bridge (3) comprises an axle (0), having a threaded portion (35, 36) at each end 

and a pair of coaxial pivot members disposed along an unthreaded portion of 
said axle (0), said antagonist members being formed by a pair of wheels (31, 32) 

coaxially and slidably disposed on said axle (0), said wheels having a diameter 
such that when the pivot members are resting on said bars (2. 2'), the inner 

sides of said wheels (31, 32) partly overlap with the external sides of said bars 
(2, 2'), a pair of self-locking nuts (33, 34) being provided for securing said 

wheels (31, 32) in their position on said axle (0) such that the distance between 
the inner sides of said wheels (31, 32) can be adjusted to match the distance 

between the external sides of said bars (2, 2') in their unloaded state and such 
that lateral deflections of said bars (2, 2') can be prevented when the machine is 

used. 
A tile scoring machine as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises a substantially T-shaped support (30') connected to the top of said 

tool carrier (1) by means of two screws (37', 38') passing through two bores 
(003', 039) arranged in the T-shaped support (30') at the neck and the lower leg 

of the T-shape, said antagonist members being in the form of a pair of wheels 
(31', 32'), each wheel being fixed to each arm of the T-shape by means of a 

screw (36') passing through a bore (03') in each arm of the T-shape and 
associated nuts (35'), each wheel (31', 32') being spaced from said support (30') 

by means of a sleeve member (33', 34'), said wheels (31', 32') being so disposed 
such that their circumferential surfaces are in contact with the external sides 

of said bars (2, 2') thereby laterally restraining said bars when the machine is 
being used.  

 
A tile scoring machine as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that said 
bore (039) arranged at the lower portion of the leg of said T-shaped support (30') 

is elongated laterally such that said T-shaped support (30') can be partially 
rotated around the bore (003') located at the neck of said T-shape (30') thereby 

enabling the angle between said leg (30') and said bars (2, 2') and 
consequentially the lateral spacing between said wheels (31', 32') with respect 

to said bars (2, 2') to be adjusted. 
A tile scoring machine as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises said antagonist members (31'', 32'') in the form of a three stepped 

bridge shaped- support profile (30'') welded to the top of said tool carrier (1), 
said support profile (30'') having two vertically extending poles adapted to 

straddle said bars (2, 2') such that they overlap the external sides of said bars 
(2, 2') each of said vertical poles being provided with a screwed bore (03'') 

through which is screwed a rod (31'', 32'') of antifriction material adjustable by 
means of a nut (33'', 34'').
