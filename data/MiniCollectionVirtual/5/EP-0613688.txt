<ABSTRACT>
The process provides a possibility for individual adaptation of the composition of the dialysis liquid to different therapeutic requirements by using a basic concentrate, which predominates by far in terms of quantity, contains mainly sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate and has a uniform standardised composition and which provides a sodium ion concentration which is at the lower limit of the physical range, and an individually selected additional concentrate which provides the supplementary amount of sodium ions and additionally contains potassium, calcium and magnesium salts and glucose in individually adapted dosage. The individual additional concentrate is a 120- to 250-fold liquid concentrate, so that an easily handled amount of, typically, 1 litre suffices for one dialysis treatment. The uniform basic concentrate is a prefabricated 15- to 18-fold liquid concentrate or is supplied as dry substance which is dissolved in water only at the place of use, and the liquid concentrate or the solution is fed through a supply system to a plurality of dialysers.

hemodialysis in the form of aquous solutions, the composition thereof being variably and

individually adaptable to differing physiological requirements of individual patients in

by the use of two concentrates, the first concentrate containing the total amount of
sodiumbicarbonate required for the preparation of the dialysis fluid, and the second

concentrate containing the total amounts of calcium and magnesium salts required for the
preparation of the dialysis fluid as well as a physiologically acceptable acid required for pH-adjustment,

charactrized in that

(a) as the first concentrate, a concentrate (basis concentrate) is used that is uniform all
over its range and contains mainly sodiumchloride and sodiumbicarbonate at a molar ratio

bicarbonate/sodium of, preferably, about 0.27, and 0.3 at the most, and the second concentrate
(individual concentrate) provides the residual constituents of the solution at an individual

composition selected in accordance with physiological requirements,
(b) the basis concentrate contains sodiumchloride at a concentration that corresponds at
least for 80 percent, typically however for less than 95 percent to the total concentration of

sodiumchloride provided for the dialysis fluid, so that, related to the ready for use dialysis 
fluid, the basis concentrate produces a concentration of sodium ions predetermined as the

standard and lying at the lower limit of the concerned physiological range, said standard being
selected in the range between 120 and 135 mmoles/litre and running preferably to about 130

mmoles/litre,
(c) the individual concentrate is a 120-fold to 150-fold, preferably a 170-fold liquid
concentrate providing a share in sodium ions which corresponds to the difference between

said standard and the predetermined individually adapted value of the sodium concentration in
the ready for use dialysis fluid, as well as potassium, calcium and magnesium ions at

individually selected concentrations corresponding to the data in the following table (in
mmoles/litre, related to the ready for use dialysis fluid):
mean value
preferred range

provides glucose according to the following data (in mmoles/litre, related to the ready for use

dialysis fluid):

The process of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by
 the use of an individual concentrate that
contains hydrochloric acid with a concentration of up to 4 mmoles/litre, related to the ready

for use dialysis fluid.
The process of one of the precedent claims, 
characterized by
 the use of a basis
concentrate which contains acetate ions up to a molar ratio acetate/sodium of 0.03 and which

constitutes a liquid 15-fold to 18-fold concentrate, related to the volume of the ready for use
dialysis fluid. 
The process of one of the precedent claims, 
characterized in that
 the basis concentrate
consists of two individual liquid components.
The process of one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the basis concentrate is used
as the dry substance and 
in that
, at the site of its application, related to the total volume of the
ready for use dialysis fluid, an at least 5-fold liquid basis concentrate is formed by dissolution

in water in an intermediate step.
The process of one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the basis concentrate is used
as the dry substance and 
in that
 the dry substance is dissolved in water and, in conjunction
with the dissolution process, is diluted with water at a ratio corresponding to the final

concentration of the dialysis fluid.
The process of claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the dry substance of the basis
concentrate is used in form of prefabricated pieces having a predetermined approximately

uniform shape and size and being comminuted in a continuous process, the comminuted
substance being dissolved in through-passing water.
The process of one of the precedent claims, 
characterized in that
 the basis concentrate
or the solution formed therefrom is introduced jointly into several hemodialysers through a

conduit system.
The process of one of the precedent claims, 
characterized in that
 the individual
concentrate is admixed continuously in the passage of a basic dialysis fluid formed by

dissolution/dilution of the basis concentrate.
The process of one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
, while circulating, a solution
is formed by mixing water and the individual concentrate at a predetermined ratio and, while

circulating, the basis concentrate is added thereto by metering at a second predetermined ratio.
The process of claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the individual concentrate is dosed
while it is fed into the water supply conduit of a hemodialyser and is admixed to the water. 
The process of one of the precedent claims, 
characterized in that
 more than one
individual concentrate are supplied simultaneously or in turn.
