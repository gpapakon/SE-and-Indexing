<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a marine display device 
comprising a liquid vessel (2) having opposed sidewalls, a 

bottom closure base (4) and an open top, said vessel (2) 
containing one or more toy fish (1), each toy fish (1) 

having an air chamber for imparting buoyancy to the toy 
fish, and comprising a magnetic member (6), a pair of 

spaced apart chambers projecting upward from the base of 
the vessel (2), an omnidirectional upwardly-rotatable 

magnetic field-creating device in each of said chambers, a 
rotatable shaft connected to each of said magnetic field-creating 

devices, and means for simultaneously rotating 
said rotatable shafts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a display apparatus 
for animated marine life and is particularly related to a display 
device comprising a liquid vessel and one or more marine lives 
swimming freely therein to simulate an aquarium. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to such aquarium 
containing one or more magnetically activated toy fish swimming 
freely in an aquatic habitat much in the same way as a natural fish 
swims in the sea. In one aspect, this invention relates to an 
aquarium containing one or more, magnetically activated swimming 
toy fish and a plurality of magnetic members disposed in said 
aquarium, which coact with the toy fish. Magnetically activated animated objects are well known in 
the art. A magnetically activated toy fish in a display device is 
described, for example, in United States Patent US-A-3,239,956. 
This patent describes a marine life display apparatus in which an 
animated toy fish having a magnet therein is freely suspended in  
 
a liquid medium and is caused to move about therein in an effort to 
simulate the swimming movement of a natural fish. In the display 
device described in said patent, a power-driven magnetic means is 
disposed below the liquid medium in which the toy fish is freely 
suspended, and causes the fish to follow a continuous pattern of 
undulating movements through the liquid thus simulating the 
movements of a natural fish. Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 55-101,383 (1980) 
and Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 60-168,895 (1985) also 
disclose magnetically activated toy fish swimming in a liquid 
habitat. Most of the heretofore known toy fish include a magnetic 
means and the fish is freely suspended in a liquid medium disposed 
in a vessel supported on a base or a panel, and a magnetic means is 
disposed below the supporting base. The magnetic means below the 
supporting base is rotated by a power source thereby varying the 
magnetic field generated by the magnet and thus activating the toy 
fish. However, the movements of the toy fish is limited, usually 
to vertical and horizontal movements, and fail to simulate the 
movements of natural fish, in all directions, in a discontinuous 
pattern.  
 A different type of aquarium is described in the EP-A-584 944. 
The aquarium described therein comprises a housing 
and a transparent liquid vessel which is at least partially filled 
with a liquid, usually water, and in one embodiment, the liquid 
vessel has a convex front surface and a generally flat rear 
surface. A marine
