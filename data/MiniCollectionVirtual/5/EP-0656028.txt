<ABSTRACT>
Vinyl ether terminated ester oligomers having a range of molecular weights are prepared by reacting a vinyl ether terminated polybasic ester with a polyol in the presence of a catalyst. Continual removal of a hydroxy monovinyl ether avoids formation compounds containing acetal moieties. Alternatively, a polybasic ester is chain extended with a polyol with continual removal of the alcohol by-product. Then, the terminal ester moieties are end capped with a monohydroxy vinyl ether. The oligomers have application in coatings and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to vinyl ether ester oligomers useful for
coatings and related applications. More particularly, it relates to new
methods of preparing such oligomers which provide a range of useful
molecular weight materials.Vinyl ether ester oligomers are disclosed in a group of U.S.
patents assigned to Allied-Signal Inc., namely U.S. 4,749,807, 4,775,732, and
4,845,265. These patents disclose methods for making the vinyl ether ester
oligomers which are not considered commercially useful in preparing
oligomers. Where acid chlorides are used, the oligomer contains HCI which
must be removed. Where esters are used, the vinyl ethers may be
converted in substantial amounts to compounds having an acetal moiety,
preventing higher molecular weight oligomers from being formed and
potentially interfering with the formation of polymers in subsequent
processing. Consequently, new methods for producing vinyl ether ester
oligomers have been sought by the present inventors and their improved
methods will be disclosed below.The invention makes possible vinyl ether terminated ester
oligomers having a range of molecular weights while avoiding the formation
of acetal moieties. The process may be generally characterized as being
a sequential one in which an ester is reacted with a polyol and the
molecular weight of the oligomers produced is adjusted by varying the initial
ratio of ester to polyol and in which the by-products are continually
vaporized and removed.In one embodiment, a vinyl ether terminated polybasic ester
is reacted with a polyol in the presence of a transesterification catalyst to
produce a vinyl ether terminated oligomer of the polybasic acid and the
polyol. The principal by-product of the reaction is a hydroxy monovinyl 
ether which is removed by distillation during the reaction. Substantially all
of the hydroxy monovinyl ether can be recovered and optionally may be
subsequently converted to one of the starting materials by reaction with a
polybasic ester. In another embodiment, a polybasic ester is chain
extended with a polyol in the presence of a transesterification catalyst and
thereafter a hydroxy monovinyl ether is added to cap the ends of the
oligomer. The loss of vinyl ether and ester to by-products containing acetal
moieties characteristic of the prior art processes is avoided, making
possible the preparation of oligomers having a range of molecular weights
and having important applications in radiation-curable coatings and for
related applications. Thermal curing is also possible.The
