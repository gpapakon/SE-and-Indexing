<ABSTRACT>
Gas-fired radiating cooktop provided with covered 
burners, wherein at least two burners, ie. a front burner 

(12) and a rear burner (13), are housed in a single 
combustion chamber (26) which makes up also the flue gas 

exhaust conduit for both burners.
 

Construction of the cooktop is thereby simplified to a 
considerable extent, whereas function, efficiency and 

operability of the burners are by no means affected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas-fired radiating cooktops 
with covered or sealed burners for cooking food and, more 
particularly, it refers to the combustion chamber lying 
underneath said cooktops, as well as to the exhaust 
conduits which are provided there for flue gases. Currently available cooktops of the above cited type 
generally use burners of the surface combustion type, 
wherein each burner is supplied through a Venturi tube 
that is arranged to supply a gas/air mixture in the 
required proportions for a correct combustion thereof. 
Furthermore, each of said burners is accomodated in a 
combustion chamber of its own, in which flame 
surveillance sensor means and ignition electrodes are 
mounted as well. The cooktop itself is sealed on its top 
surface by a plate, preferably of an appropriate glass-ceramic 
material that is substantially transparent to 
radiations, said plate acting as the pan supporting 
plate. In this connection it shall further be pointed out  
 
that each combustion chamber is connected with the 
outside atmosphere through a flue gas exhaust conduit of 
its own. Until now, it has been a common rule in this 
particular sector to think that said flue gas exhaust 
conduits had actually to remain strictly separated and 
distinct from each other up to their respective outlet 
ports or to the chimney, fearing that the flue gas flow 
from a burner might have been such as to negatively 
affect in some way the regular combustion performance of 
the other burners and their corresponding ability of 
regularly exhausting their flue gases. This technical prejudice has been instrumental in 
bringing about considerable limitations in the use and 
serious complications in the construction of these 
cooktops. As a matter of fact, flue gas exhaust conduits 
shall be provided with a very large cross-sectional flow 
area in view of assuring a correct outflow of said flue 
gases, and furthermore they shall all be arranged on the 
same plate, since each vertical deviation of their paths, 
for instance in order to step over a rear burner, brings 
about pressure losses that are certainly not sustainable 
on account of the very low combustion pressure values 
involved. Therefore, the space which is normally available 
across the width dimensions of these cooktops for the 
flue gas exhaust conduits is usually not enough to allow 
for all such exhaust conduits to be accomodated 
indipendently in a side-by-side arrangement. This is the reason why, for instance, current 
radiating cooktops with four

<CLAIMS>
Gas-fired radiating cooktop with covered burners, 
comprising a box-like casing (10) closed on its top by a 

plate (11) of glass-ceramic or similar material, which 
defines at least a combustion chamber (26), a plurality 

of atmospheric burners (12, 13, 14, 15) of the surface 
combustion type being housed inside said box-like casing, 

said burners being supplied with air-gas mixture through 

respective Venturi tubes and related valves and being 
further controlled by control devices mounted on the 

front side of the casing (10), characterized in that said 
combustion chamber (26) accomodates at least two burners, 

namely a front burner (12) and a rear burner (13), and 
forms also one common flue gas exhaust conduit for said 

burners (12, 13) so that the flue gases of the front 
burner (12) flow over the rear burner (13). 
Gas-fired radiating cooktop according to claim 1, 
characterized in that it includes at least four burners 

(12, 13, 14, 15) that are respectively aligned 
longitudinally in a two-by-two arrangement, said 

combustion chamber (26) being one and the same for all 
said burners. 
Gas-fired radiating cooktop according to claim 2, characterized in that said combustion chamber (26) is 
divided into two chambers through the provision of a 

longitudinal baffle plate (30), each one of said chambers 
accomodating two burners, ie. a front burner (12 or 14) 

and a rear burner (13 or 15, respectively. 
Gas-fired radiating cooktop according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that in the case in 

which the front burner and the rear burner are brought 
closer to each other, a baffle means (40) is arranged in 

front of the rear burner, said baffle means (40) being 
adapted to favour the rising movement of the flue gas 

flow from the front burner toward the lower surface of 
the glass-ceramic plate (11).
