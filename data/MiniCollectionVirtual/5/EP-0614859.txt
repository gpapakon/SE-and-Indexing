<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the cementing of high 
temperature wells. 
The retarder consists of a methylene phosphonic 
acid derivative and of a boric acid or a borate at least as 

acid as borax in an aqueous solution, in particular Na 
pentaborate, in a preferred ratio of 0.08 to 0.92 parts by 

weight. 
A long setting time and very swift compressive 
strength development are obtained at the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the technical sector
concerned with the cementing of the annuluses of oil, gas,
water, geothermal and analogous wells.The man of the art is familiar with the need,
after a well has been drilled, to inject a cement slurry
into the annulus located between the casing and the
underground formations, both to consolidate the well and to
insulate the different zones.The process consists in injecting the slurry into
the casing right down to the bottomhole, and then in causing
it to rise up through the annulus, where it is allowed to
set. The general process is well known, and there is no need
to explain it in detail here.We are also familiar with the difficulties
experienced by the operator, particularly on account of the
temperature cycle undergone by the cement slurry.This problem is particularly acute in the case of
wells in which the slurry will be subjected to high
temperatures.In this case, it is particularly difficult to
reconcile two vital requirements, one being to retard the
setting of the cement sufficiently (and despite the fact
that the slurry goes through a high temperature stage) for
setting actually to take place in the annulus, and the other
requirement being not to prolong unduly, through the effect
of the necessary retarder, the time that the cement slurry, 
and in particular that portion of it which is located
towards the top of the well, that is to say at a fairly low
temperature, will take to set to a sufficient degree.In the case of deep wells, that is to say one of
the examples of high temperature wells, the problem is
aggravated by the fact that the slurry pumping time is
longer.The solutions proposed in the prior art are either
inadequate or very imperfect, or unsatisfactory.According to US patents 4 941 536 and 5 049 288, a
borate is mixed with a water soluble copolymer. In the
examples given, these patents do not make it possible to
obtain both a long thickening time (TT) , that is to say of
more than 7 hours at the bottom hole circulation temperature
(BHCT) , and swift compressive strenght development for the
cement after its placement for temperature below the BHCT,
the criterion in this connection being that of attaining 35
kg/cm2 (500 psi) in less than 24 hours at a temperature 30°
F below the BHCT (or approximately BHCT less 17°C).It is also known to use organophosphates for their
deflocculating and sequestering properties (US patents 3 346
488 and 5 089 150), as well as their stability, and to use
them as dispersants (American patent application SN 487
