<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lockable heating apparatus having a treating space for sintering, drying or cooking for example. It is possible to select for fixable temperature ranges control devices which control at least one thermal heating device which is located in the treating space and can be combined with microwave energy. As a function of the relative dielectric constant ( epsilon R) of the material to be treated, the control device doses an initial amount of microwave energy and fixes a time-dependent timing ratio for the thermal heating device. As a function of the treating procedure and of the desired temperature, the control device prescribes a heating time phase for the thermal heating device, and switches off the thermal heating device for a minimum time between two heating phases which is specific to the item to be treated and is adapted to the temperature sensor.

Closable heating apparatus with a treatment chamber for, for example, sintering,
drying, cooking, wherein regulating devices which control at least one thermal heating

device, which is disposed in the treatment chamber and can be combined with microwave
energy, are selectable for fixable temperature ranges, characterised in that the regulating

device meters a microwave start-up energy in dependence on the relative dielectric
constant (ÎµR) of the stock to be treated, that the regulating device fixes a time-dependent

keying ratio for the thermal heating device, that the regulating device presets a heating
time phase in dependence on the handling procedure and the target temperature for the

thermal heating device, and that the regulating device switches off the thermal heating
device for a minimum time, which is specific to the stock to be treated and matched to

temperature sensor, between two heating phases.
Closable heating apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the
regulating device outputs the microwave start-up energy metering under sensor control.
Closable heating apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that a control
unit (1) activates a heating time timer (31), which switches on and off the keyable heating

device (32) in the treatment chamber in a heat phase controlling manner, by way of an
output bus (4).
Closable heating apparatus according to claim 1, 3, characterised in that the
control unit (1) links the target values - for example, mode of operation, weight of the stock

to be treated, target temperature value - disposed on an input bus (2) with the regulating
data - for example, temperature sensor data, moisture sensor data, gas sensor data -

disposed on a control bus (3) to form regulating and output data and controls by way of the
output bus (4), for example, a timer (31), a heater (32), a microwave generator (33) and a

fan (34) for an optimised on/off regulating play of a selected mean temperature value.
Closable heating apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the control
unit (1) is part of a separate microprocessor.
