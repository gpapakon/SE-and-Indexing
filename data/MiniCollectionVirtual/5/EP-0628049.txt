<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITUTED BENZIMIDAZOLES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AS WELL AS THEIR USE.DESCRIPTIONField of the inventionThe object of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, which inhibit exogenously or endogenously stimulated gastric acid secretion and thus can be used in the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer.The present invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the invention for inhibiting gastric acid secretion in mammals including man. In a more general sense, the compounds of the invention may be used for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, and gastric acid-related diseases in mammals including man, such as gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, reflux esophagitis, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Furthermore, the compounds may be used for treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders where gastric antisecretory effect is desirable e.g. in patients with gastrinomas, and in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They may also be used in patients in intensive care situations, and pre- and postoperatively to prevent acid aspiration and stress ulceration. The compounds of the invention may also be used for treatment or prophy¬ laxis of inflammatory conditions in mammals, including man, especially those involving lysozymal enzyme-.. Conditions that may be specifically mentioned are rheumatoid arthritis and gout. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the invention, as active ingredient. In a further aspect, the invention relates to processes for 

 preparation of such new compounds and to the use of th active compounds for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the medical use indicated above.The compounds of the invention will not block the uptake of iodine into the thyroid gland. It has earlie been disclosed in several lectures from the company, where the inventors are working that thyroid toxicity depends on if the compounds are lipophilic or not. The inventors have now unexpectedly found that it is not the lipophilicity that is the critical parameter. The claimed compounds, which include rather hydrophilic compounds, do not give any thyroid toxic effect and have at the same time high acid secretion inhibitory effect.The compounds of the invention will also exhibit a high solubility and a high chemical stability in water.Background of the inventionSimilar disubstituted 2-[[(3,4-dialkoxy-2-pyridinγl)- methyl]sulfinγl]-lH-benzi_τ.idazole-l-yl compounds are described in
