<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automatic transmission and
particularly relates to a multiple ratio automatic
transmission mechanism having a simplified valve system and
simplified ratio controlling clutches and brakes that adapt
an automotive vehicle driveline for all operating demands
with a minimum number of control elements and with reduced
driveline space requirements.This invention provides to improvements in a valve
system of the kind shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,938,097,
issued to Stanley L. Pierce, which is assigned to the
assignee of our present invention. This invention includes
features that are common to the invention described in U.S.
Patent No. 5,157,608, issued to B. G. Sankpal, J. A.
Daubenmier, L. J. Kurdziel, J. F. Carnago, W. Lewis, Jr.,
and R. S. Williams. The '608 patent also is assigned to the
assignee of the present invention.The '608 patent describes a control system having a
microprocessor that establishes optimum control pressure
levels for fluid pressure operated clutches and brakes that
are used to effect ratio changes, whereby optimum clutch and
brake servo pressures are maintained for each ratio change
as torque capacity of an off-going clutch or brake is
reduced in synchronism with the increase in torque capacity
of an oncoming clutch or brake.This invention includes also features that are common
to the invention of U.S. Patent No. 5,150,297, issued to
J.A. Daubenmier, P. A. Baltusis, R. T. Cowen, J. E. El-Khoury,
and R. S. Williams. The '297 patent also is
assigned to the assignee of our present invention. It
describes a valve system for controlling ratio shifts in a
transmission control system that includes a microprocessor
and that responds to sensed variables including engine
speed, vehicle speed and driver actuated range selector
position, thus enabling the control system to adjust to
varying road speed, engine torque and road conditions with
high quality shift performance. The hydrokinetic torque converter of the transmission
embodying this invention has a bypass clutch controlled by
the valve system. The bypass clutch has features that are
common to the control system described in U.S. Patent No.
5,029,087, issued to R.T. Cowen, R.L. Huffmaster and P.K.
Jain, and to the hydrokinetic torque converter control
system of US-A-5 303 616
by B.J. Palansky, T.L. Greene, J.A.
Daubenmier, G.F. McCall, L. H. Buch and P.E. Smith.
That copending patent also is
assigned to the assignee of this present invention. The
disclosure of the co-pending patent describes a torque
converter

<CLAIMS>
An automatic transmission for use in a vehicle
driveline comprising multiple ratio gearing, adapted to

provide multiple torque flow paths from a driving member to
a driven member, a fluid pressure operated brake means (2/4 BB ; 158) for

anchoring a reaction member (S2) for said gearing;

first clutch means (CC ; 108) for delivering torque from said
driving member to one torque input member (S1) of said gearing

while said brake means is applied to establish one gear
ratio (2nd);
second clutch means (DC ; 88) for delivering torque from said
driving member to another torque input member (R1) of said

gearing while said brake means is applied to establish
another gear ratio (4th), said first and second clutch means being

applied simultaneously while said brake means is released to
establish a gear ratio (3rd) intermediate said one gear ratio and

said other gear ratio; and
a fluid pressure accumulator means (236) for cushioning
application of said brake means during establishment of said

one gear ratio and said other gear ratio;
said brake means including a double action servo (222) having
a piston that partially defines a brake apply pressure

chamber and a brake release pressure chamber;
a pressure accumulator (236) in fluid communication with said
brake apply pressure chamber during operation of said

transmission in said one gear ratio and said other gear
ratio; characterised by

control valve means (244, 248) for interrupting communication of said
pressure accumulator with said brake apply pressure chamber

when said intermediate gear ratio is established and
establishing such communication when said one gear ratio and

said other gear ratio is established.
A transmission as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said
transmission comprises a control valve circuit including a

line pressure source (230); 

a main regulator valve means (226) in said circuit for
regulating pressure from said pressure source;
means (198) for establishing a torque pressure signal (234)

indicating the magnitude of torque delivered by said driving
member;
said regulator valve means being in communication with
said torque pressure signal whereby optimum torque capacity

of said brake means and said first and second clutch means
is maintained during ratio changes into said one gear ratio

and into said other gear ratio.
A transmission as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said
transmission comprises a control valve circuit including a

pressure source (230), first (246) and second (248) shift valve means for
selectively distributing pressure from said pressure source

to each of said clutch means and to said brake means;

shift solenoid valve means (SS1, SS2) for developing shift
pressure signals in response to changing operating variables

including driven member speed and torque on said driving
member, said shift pressure signals being distributed to and

actuating said first and second shift valve means;
each shift valve means being in communication with said
brake apply pressure chamber, at least one shift valve means (248)

being in communication (370) with said servo release pressure
chamber whereby ratio changes between each of four speed

ratios is achieved; and
means for distributing regulated pressure from said
regulator valve means (226) to said brake apply chamber through at

least one shift valve means (248) whereby optimum torque capacity
of said brake means is maintained during ratio shift between

two intermediate gear ratios between the lowest gear ratio
and the highest gear ratio.
A transmission as claimed in Claim 1, including
separate fluid pressure feed passage means (378 ; 412) and fluid

pressure return passage means (224 ; 210, 408) communicating with said first
and second clutch means and with said brake means, and a 

calibrated flow control orifice (A; M, E) in said pressure feed
passage means for controlling engagement timing, the fluid

return flow in said return passage means (392 ; 408) being unrestricted
thereby effecting rapid disengagement of said first and

second clutch means and said brake means.
A transmission as claimed in Claim 1, including a
servo release valve means (228) communicating with said servo

release pressure chamber for modulating the ratio of flow of
fluid from said release pressure chamber upon application of

said brake means.
