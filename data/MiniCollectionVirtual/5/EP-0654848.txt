<ABSTRACT>
A set (2) of electrical terminals (6A,6B,6C) is 
provided for grounding electrical leads of a harness, for 

example an automotive engine harness. Each terminal 
comprises two spaced pairs of spring beams (40) defining 

a pair of aligned, insulation displacement slots (18) for 
receiving a common electrical lead. The spring beams (40) 

of each pair are defined by a pair of juxtaposed loops 
(20). The loops (20) of all of the terminals (6A,6B,6C) 

are connected together to provide a cage-like structure 
(16) by a front wall (22), a rear wall (24) and a base 

(26,27). One end of each loop (20) is connected to the 
front wall (22) and the other end of each loop (20) is 

connected to the rear wall (24). Lead strain relief 
ferrules (12,14) project rearwardly from the base (26,27) 

and the rear wall (24) in a single row in closely spaced 
relationship. The rear wall (24) is secured to the base 

(26,27) by means of a flange (42) which has been struck 
out from the base (26,27) and which engages over a neck 

(44) connecting one (14) of the ferrules (12,14) to the 
rear wall (24). A plurality of the sets of terminals (2,4) 

may be connected by carrier strips and disposed in the 
separate housings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sets of electrical
terminals for use in commonly grounding leads of an
electrical harness, for example an automotive engine
harness. The invention also concerns a method of
manufacturing such a terminal set.A typical electrical harness, for example an engine
harness for an automotive vehicle comprises a main
electrical connector and a multiplicity of satellite
electrical connectors connected to the main connector by
insulated electrical leads. The satellite connectors are
provided for mating with corresponding terminals of
appliances of the vehicle, for many of which a ground
connection is needed. Conventionally, grounding leads for
these appliances are connected to ground by means of
separate electrical terminals which may, or may not, be
disposed in a common housing.In the interest of economy, these grounding terminals
are preferably identical and comprise a set of stamped and
formed electrical terminals, each terminal comprising two
spaced pairs of spring beams defining a pair of aligned
insulation displacement slots for receiving a common
electrical lead, and a lead strain relief ferrule aligned
with the lead receiving slots; (see e.g. GB-A-1 483 981).A set of terminals according to the present
invention, is characterised in that the spring beams of
each pair are defined by a pair of juxtaposed loops, the
loops of all of the terminals of the terminal set being
connected together to provide a cage-like structure, by a
front wall, a rear wall and a base, one end of each loop
being connected to the front wall and the other end of
each loop being connected to the rear wall, the lead
strain relief ferrules projecting rearwardly from the base
and the rear wall in a single row in closely spaced 
relationship and the rear wall being secured to the base.Such a composite set of electrical terminals can more
readily be loaded into an insulating housing therefore,
than can separate electrical terminals and provides for
high contact density and for ease of manufacture. A
plurality of these composite sets of terminals can
conveniently be manufactured by conventional die stamping
and forming techniques, according to the number of leads
of a harness which are to be grounded. As disclosed
herein, the composite terminal sets, remaining connected
thereto by the carrier strips used in the progressive
forming operation, can be disposed in separate housings
which are so assembled together in modular form, that the
housings are rigidly connected together so that the
carrier strips cannot be bent

<CLAIMS>
A set (2) of electrical terminals comprising multiple
electrical terminals (6A,6B,6C) where each terminal includes

a first pair of spring arms (40) and a second pair of
spring arms (40), the spring arms of each pair are defined by a pair

of juxtaposed loops (20), the loops of all the terminals of the terminal
set being connected together so provide a cage-like structure, by a front

wall (22), a rear wall (24) and a base (26,27), each pair of spring arms (40) defining a
lead receiving slot (18) therebetween that is open to

receive a lead (L) therein, the first and second pairs of
spring arms (40) of each of the terminals extend from the

front and rear wall (22,24) respectively, a strain
relief ferrule (12,14) aligned with the slots for

retaining the lead (L) inserted therein, wherein the
strain relief ferrules (12,14) are disposed adjacent to

each other, and one of the strain relief ferrules (12)
