<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing an exposed silver halide color 
photographic photosensitive material is disclosed, which 

comprises the step of developing the exposed material with a 
color developer in a color development tank of an automatic 

developing apparatus, the developer in the developer tank 
being replenished with replenishing water and a solid color 

developing composition comprising a p-phenylenediamine color 
developing agent having a water-solubilizing group, wherein 

the replenishing amount of the water is 30 to 75ml per mÂ² of 
the material processed and the replenishing amount of the 

color developing agent is 0.024 to 0.066 mol per liter of the 
replenishing amount of the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for processing a silver
halide color photographic light-sensitive material and a
method for producing a color photographic image.A silver halide color photographic light-sensitive
material has photographically been processed with a processing
solution using an automatic processing machine. On such
occasions, a replenisher replenishing system is commonly used
wherein the processing solution in a processing tank is
controlled so that the activity thereof is kept constant. In
the case of the replenisher replenishing system, processing
agents are dissolved to prepare a replenishing solution, and
the solution is replenished so that the processing agents are
replenished. However, since the solution replenishing produces
overflow solution corresponding to the replenishing amount
except for the evaporated amount, much overflow solution as
photographic waste is ordinarily discharged. This is a
problem, since there has been recent world wide movement for
regulations to prohibit dumping of photographic waste into
oceans.On the other hand, a method to reduce the waste by
regenerating the processing solution is disclosed in WO91-07698
or WO91-07699. However, in this method the apparatus for
the regeneration is necessary besides the processing machine,
and its system is complex and large.Therefore, a less replenishment method reducing a
replenisher has been developed in order to reduce the
photographic waste. However, even if a light-sensitive
material is processed in this replenishment method, the amount
of the processing components consumed and replenished are not
changed. Therefore, the replenisher has been concentrated.
As a result, recently the replenisher is so concentrated as to
reach the solubility limit of the processing agent.
Accordingly, a further reduced replenishment method has
problems such as poor storage stability of the replenisher or
occurrence of precipitations in the replenisher, and it is
impossible to further reduce the waste by such replenishment
of the replenisher. Recently, a solid processing composition has been
developed for the processing composition for a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material. There is disclosed a
method, for example, in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.
5-119454 that all processing components are solidified and are
incorporated directly to the processing tank to replenish the
processing components. There is also disclosed a method in
Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 4-213454 that powdered
processing components
