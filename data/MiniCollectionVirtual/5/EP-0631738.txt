<ABSTRACT>
Hair dryers are fitted with electrically driven fans (4) which cause a considerably high noise level. The noise nuisance can be reduced significantly according to the invention if a housing attachment (8) is fitted over the intake opening adjacent to such a fan (4), which housing attachment forms a housing chamber (80) which precedes the first intake opening (12) and is connected to the environment via a second intake opening (84).

An air blower, in particular for drying hair, essentially comprising a housing with a 
current supply for an electric motor fixed inside the housing, a fan connected to the electric 

motor, and further structural elements, wherein a first intake opening is provided on 
the housing in such a way that the fan conveys fresh air from the surrounding atmosphere 

into the interior of the housing and out from the interior of the housing by way of a discharge 
opening, wherein the first intake opening is covered by a housing chamber by 

means of a housing attachment which can be connected to the housing or is integral 
therewith, wherein a second intake opening (84), by way of which alone the housing 

chamber (80) is open to the surrounding atmosphere (
U
), is provided in the housing 
attachment (8), and the intake openings (12; 84) are arranged coaxially, 
characterized in 
that
 the flow cross-section (
d
) of the second intake opening (84) is smaller for determining 
the flow than that (
D
) of the first intake opening (12). 
An air blower according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the intake openings (12; 84) 
are made rotationally symmetrical. 
An air blower according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the intake openings (12; 
84) are constructed as circular cross-sections. 
An air blower according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the housing 
attachment (8) is constructed as a rotationally symmetrical component. 
An air blower according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the [axis] of rotation of the 

housing attachment (8) concides with that of an or the intake opening or openings. 
An air blower according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the first intake 
opening (12) is provided in a front wall (11) of the housing (1), the surrounding edge of 

which is flush with a first front face (81) of the housing attachment (8). 
An air blower according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the housing 
attachment (8) comprises a cylindrical or frustoconical peripheral part (83) which connects 

the first front face (81) resting on the housing (1) to a second front face (82) in 
which the second intake opening (84) is situated.  

 
An air blower according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 in the housing attachment (8) 
at least one baffle plate (85) is attached to the peripheral part (83) at right angles thereto, 

the said peripheral part (83) being provided with a rotationally symmetrical flow opening 
(86). 
An air blower according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the flow opening (86) of the 
baffle plate (85) has a flow cross-section which, as a function of the distance thereof 

from the first and the second intake opening (12; 84) respectively, is in line with the flow 
cross-sections (
D
; 
d
) and so is larger than that of the second and smaller than that of the 
first intake opening (12; 84). 
An air blower according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 in the housing attachment (8) 
a baffle plate (89) constructed in the shape of a hollow circular cylinder is connected, 

directed inwards, to the second front face (82). 
An air blower according to one of Claims 7 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the second 
intake opening (84) is surrounded coaxially by a frustoconical constriction (88) of the 

associated front face (82).
