<ABSTRACT>
Rolling-contact bearing equipped with an information-sensor device made up of an encoder element (12) which moves in front of a sensor (11) carried by an orientable annular support (20) and mounted in a slideway (30) formed on the said support (20) and associated with means for immobilising the said sensor, characterised in that the support carries means (26) for axial positioning in contact with the stationary race (2) of the rolling-contact bearing and elastic means for returning the sensor (11) into contact with the said support (20) and for radially immobilising the said sensor in the said slideway (30).

A rolling bearing provided with a data sensor device constituted by a coding element 
(12) which moves in front of a sensor (11) having a mounting head (110) with guide 

edges supported by a guidable annular support (20) which is mounted in a guide (30, 41) 
which is formed on said support (20) and associated with means for immobilising said 

sensor, characterised by the fact that the guide edges perform their guiding function with 
the aid of grooves (111), the support (20) has axial positioning means (26, 27, 27') in 

contact with the fixed ring (2) for the rolling bearing and elastic return means (31, 42) 
with a return holding rib (33, 43) cooperating with a transverse groove (112) of the 

mounting head (110) of the sensor (11) in contact with said support (20), for obtaining 
radial immobilisation of said mounting head (110) of said sensor (11) in the guide (30). 
A rolling bearing according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the support (20) 
for the mounting head (110) of the sensor (11) is constituted by an annular disk which 

has cut out zones (25) and functional regions of deformation (26, 27, 27') which are 
iocated in said zones, with the aim of immobilising said support in relation to the rolling 

bearing. 
A rolling bearing according to Claim 2, characterised by the fact that the cut out zones 
(25) of the disk are angularly distributed along the periphery of the disk and are 

delimited by small elastic bars (26) which bend radially towards the base of a groove 
(22) which is machined on the fixed ring (2) of the rolling bearing. 
A rolling bearing according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the retaining rib 
of the sensor is formed by a portion (33), with a shaped spring wire bearing segments 

(45) for hooked attachment to an annular disk (20). 
A rolling bearing according to Claim 4, characterised by the fact that the sprung wire is 
shaped into a stirrup member (31) whose limbs (32) are anchored within the disk (20) 

which supports the mounting head (110) of the sensor (11).  
 
A rolling bearing according to Claim 4, characterised by the fact that the sprung wire is 
constituted by an expandable elastic ring in contact with the assembly legs (44) 

distributed circumferentially over the outer face of the annular disk (20). 
A rolling bearing according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised by the fact that 
the retaining rib (43) for the mounting head (110) of the sensor (11) is supported by an 

elastic tongue portion (42) which is directed towards said mounting head (11)). 
A rolling bearing according to any one of Claims 3, 6 or 7, characterised by the fact that 
the means (26) for immobilising the annular disk (20) of the mounting head (110) of the 

sensor (11) and the retaining means (42) for said mounting head (110) are formed by 
regions of punching located on the surface of the disk (20).
