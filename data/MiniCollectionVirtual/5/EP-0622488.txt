<ABSTRACT>
Claimed is the use of a laminate of a textile material covered with a 
copolyetherester film having a water vapour transmission rate of at 

least 1000 g/m²/day for the manufacture therefrom of waterproof 
rainwear, shoes, tents, and mattress covers, and for the complete 

covering therewith of moulded articles of foam rubber for use in 
chairs or mattresses, the copolyetherester being composed of a 

plurality of recurrent intralinear long-chain ester units and 
short-chain ester units which are randomly joined head-to-tail thr
ough 
ester bonds, with at least 20 wt.% of the long-chain ester units being 

prepared from a long-chain glycol having a carbon to oxygen ratio in 
the range of 2,0 to 2,4, which glycol constitutes 15-45 wt.% of the 

copolyetherester, and with at least 70 wt.% of the short-chain ester 
units consisting of butylene naphthalate units constituting 20-80 wt.% 

of the copolyetherester. Compared with the known 
polyetherester-textile laminates, the claimed laminates exhibit 

surprisingly low permanent plastic deformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the use of a laminate of a textile material 
covered with a copolyetherester film having a water vapour 
transmission rate of at least 1000 g/m2/day for the manufacture 
therefrom of waterproof rainwear, shoes, tents, and mattress covers, 
and for the complete covering therewith of moulded articles of foam 
rubber for use in chairs or mattresses, the copolyetherester being 
composed of a plurality of recurrent intralinear long-chain ester 
units and short-chain ester units which are randomly joined head-to-tail 
through ester bonds, the long-chain ester units corresponding to 
the formula: 
 
and the short-chain ester units corresponding to the formula: 
 
where G is a divalent radical remaining after the removal of terminal 
hydroxyl groups from at least one long-chain glycol having a average 
molecular weight in the range of 600 to 4000 and an atomic ratio of 
carbon to oxygen in the range of 2,0 to 4,3, at least 20 wt.% of the 
long-chain glycol having a carbon to oxygen ratio in the range of 2,0 
to 2,4, and 15-45 wt.% of said glycol being part of the 
copolyetherester, R is a divalent radical remaining after the removal 
of carboxyl groups from at least one dicarboxylic acid having a 
molecular weight of less than 300, and D is a divalent radical 
remaining after the removal of hydroxyl groups from at least one diol 
having a molecular weight of less than 250.  
 The use of a laminate of a textile material and a copolyetherester 
film of the aforementioned type for manufacturing rainwear or tents is 
known from US-A-4 493 870, while a process for completely covering 
foam rubber articles with a laminate of the aforementioned type for 
use in chairs or mattresses is disclosed in US-A-5 114 784. 
In the manufacture of the rainwear described in the former patent 
publication, use is made of textile material covered with a film of a 
copolyetherester of which the short-chain ester units entirely or 
substantially consist of butylene terephthalate units. 
However, this type of copolyetherester film has the drawback of 
suffering comparatively major permanent plastic deformation, which 
property renders this type of film less suitable for use in making 
more elastic rainwear, let alone waterproof shoes and breathable 
sportswear, such as is employed in jogging, wind surfing, and the 
like. A similar disadvantage applies to a process for completely 
covering foam plastic moulded articles with a laminate of the 
aforementioned type for use in chairs or mattresses. Waterproof
