<ABSTRACT>
A free size cap includes a crown (1), a portion (1-2, 1-3, 
1-4, 1-5) of which rearward from the visor (3) is formed 

of a stretch woven fabric consisting of stretchable weft yarns 
and non-stretchable warp yarns, and a sweat band (4) having 

an elasticity and a stretchability, wherein the lower edge of 
the sweat band (4) is sewn to the crown (1) along the bottom 

edge (5) of the inner wall thereof, whereby the stretch woven 
fabric of the crown (1) and the sweat band (4) are 

stretchable/shrinkable in the inner-circumferential direction 
of the crown (1), for example, by an amount of 6.35 cm in a 

cap having a standard size of 60 cm ± 3 cm. The upper edge 
of the sweat band (4) is preferably sewn to a multi-stitch 

line area (6-1, 6-2, 6-3) in the inner surface of the crown 
(1) rearward from the visor (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a free size cap capable of accommodating
various size heads, for example, in a range of 57 cm through 63 cm with only
one standard size, while maintaining the comfort of wearer.Since it is not necessary to produce and market a
free size cap in several size classes as is the case with
a conventional cap, it
is possible to realize the sharp reduction of selling cost in association with
the simplification of production line/installation, the reduction of labor
time, the saving of space as well as the improvement of distribution efficiency.
Such free size caps are known, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,662,007 and 5,119,514. It is common to these U.S. Patents that gores forming
a portion of cap crown rearward from a visor are prepared with a stretch fabric.
A free size cap according to the U.S. Patent no. 4,662,007 has ear flaps on the
bottom edge of the crown in the portion reaward from the visor, made from a
weft knitted fabric. In a normal state, the ear flaps are folded upward from
the bottom edge of the crown. In the cold season such as winter, the ear flaps
are unfolded down to cover the wearer's ears to maintain a temperature thereof.
The ear flaps have a function as a sweat band when it is worn while being
folded inside of the crown.While, a free size cap according to the U.S. Patent No. 5,119,514 has a
relatively stiff ear shield extending integrally of a visor as well as a cut-away
in the rear portion of a crown and a pair of male/female members, for
example, of a snap tape or a Velcro® fastener with a length of about 10-15 cm (4∼6 inches),
each secured on the opposite edge of the cut-away so that a cap size is
adjustable. That is, in the case of the snap tape, the male member has a series
of nodules arranged in the lengthwise direction at a predetermined pitch, while 
the female member has a series of eyelets corresponding to the nodules, whereby
the cap size is adjustable to be fit with the wearer's head by snapping the
nodules into the suitable eyelets.As stated above, in the U.S. Patent No. 4,662,007, the cap has a normally
folded ear flaps secured on the bottom edge of the crown in the portion thereof
rearward from the visor, which are unfolded down, if necessary, to cover and
warm the wearer's ears. Also it is possible to impart the sweat aborbing
function to the cap by folding the ear flaps inward of the crown. When one
wishes to impart the sweat absorbing function by folding the ear flaps inward of
the crown, however, problems occur in that, since there

<CLAIMS>
A free size cap comprising a crown (1) including
a plurality of gores (1-1 to 1-6), front ones (1-1, 1-6) of

which are of a non-stretchable material, the remaining
rearward gores (1-2 to 1-5) being of a stretchable fabric

consisting of stretchable weft yarns woven with non-stretchable
warp yarns, a visor (3) attached to said front

gores (1-1, 1-6), and an elastic sweat band (4) of a
stretchable fabric consisting of stretchable weft yarns

woven with non-stretchable warp yarns, characterised in
that the sweat band (4) is a single sheet in

structure the lower edge of which is sewn to the interior
of the crown (1) along the whole bottom edge (5) of the inner

surface of the crown (1) so that the stretchable woven
fabric of the rearward gores (1-2 to 1-5) of the crown (1)

and the sweat band (4) are stretchable and shrinkable in
the direction of the inner circumference of the crown (1),

the stretchability of the rearward gores (1-2 to 1-5) and
that part of the sweat band (4) to the rear of the visor

being, for a cap the crown (1) of which has a natural
circumference of 60cm ± 6cm, maximal 6.35cm.
A free size cap as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
weft of the stretchable woven fabric forming the rearward

gores (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5) of the crown (1) is a
polyurethane elastomer yarn.
