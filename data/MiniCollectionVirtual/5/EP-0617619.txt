<DESCRIPTION>
The leading cause of dementia and the fourth leading 
cause of death in the developed world is Alzheimer 
disease, which afflicts an estimated 10% of the 
population over 65 years of age in the United States. 
The disease manifests itself as insidious memory loss, 
cognitive decline, and personality changes that result in 
loss of functional ability over the course of a decade. 
In their debilitated state, patients usually retain only 
vegetative neurologic function, and succumb to secondary 
infections. Alzheimer disease is characterized by certain 
neuropathological lesions, including intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular parenchymal and 
cerebrovascular amyloid. The principal component of the 
amyloid deposits is a protein designated β/A4 amyloid (4, 
5), a -4 kDa polypeptide arising from cleavage of the 
amyloid precursor protein (APP), see Goldgaber et al., 
Science,235, pp. 887-880 (1987). APP exists as three 
major transmembrane isoforms (APP695, APP751, and APP770) that 
result from alternative splicing of a single primary 
transcript (Fig. 1A), see Kang et al., Nature (London), 
325, pp. 733-736 (1987). Proteolytic processing of APP 
leads to cleavage within the β/A4 domain and precludes 
amyloidogenesis. The biochemical defect responsible for 
amyloid production in Alzheimer disease might therefore 
involve either a deficiency in normal proteolysis or 
excessive activity of an alternative pathway. It is 
noteworthy that two types of inherited cerebral 
amyloidoses -- hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with 
amyloidosis (Dutch type) and familial early onset 
Alzheimer disease -- are associated with mutations in the 
coding sequence of APP near the β/A4-amyloid domain.  
 Alzheimer disease is characterized by abnormal protein 
phosphorylation and altered protein catabolism. From the 
work of several laboratories, altered protein 
phosphorylation has been implicated in the formation of 
the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles found in 
Alzheimer disease. However, a role for protein 
phosphorylation in the catabolism of the β/A4 protein 
precursor (βAPP) has not been demonstrated. A central feature of the pathology of Alzheimer disease 
is the deposition of amyloid protein within plaques. The 
4 kDa amyloid protein (also referred to as A4 (APC, 
β-amyloid or BAP) is a truncated form of the larger 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is encoded by a 
gene localized on chromosome 21 (Goldgaber et al., 1987, 
Science,235:877-880; Kang et al., 1987, Nature, 
325:733-736; Jenkins et
