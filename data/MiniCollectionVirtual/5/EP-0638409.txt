<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for vulcanising tyres includes an interlocking device 3 making it possible to introduce a tyre into a mould 1 and to transfer to the mould the thermal energy necessary for vulcanisation by means of inductors 42. It includes an ancillary chamber 5 housing several moulds 1 simultaneously and making it possible to keep each mould 1 insulated from the environment in order to limit heat losses during the time necessary for vulcanisation.

<CLAIMS>
A vulcanisation apparatus for tyres
introduced into a mould (1), comprising a centralised

heating station having means which can be coupled to
the mould when the latter remains in said heating

station for the time necessary to transfer thereto the
heat energy to be returned to the tyre, and means for

moving the mould, uncoupled from said energy transfer
means, towards an annexed waiting chamber (5) capable

of receiving a plurality of tyres and their moulds in
order to complete the vulcanisation reaction therein at

least in part under the effect of the heat stored by
the mould at said heating station.
An apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that it comprises an encaser (3)

making it possible to introduce or withdraw the tyre
from said mould (1).
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 or
2, utilising a mould made, at least in part, of

magnetic metal material and in which said station
comprises electric inductors (42) producing eddy

currents in the mould (1) in order to ensure the
transfer of heat energy.
An apparatus according to Claim 3,
characterised in that, during the transfer of energy,

the inductors (42) are arranged on the back of the
mould (1) on the side opposite the moulding surfaces.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to
4, characterised in that the means which can be coupled

to the mould comprise arms (34) which can be locked and
unlocked on the mould, said arms being equipped with

inductors (42) which make it possible to transfer heat
energy to the mould by inductive coupling. 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to
5, characterised in that said station is incorporated

in the encaser (3).
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that said chamber (5) comprises a

rotary carousel (51) capable of receiving the moulds
(1) at different places arranged in a circle around the

carousel (51).
A method of vulcanising tyres comprising the
following operations:


introducing each tyre into a mould of substantial
heat capacity and imparting to the mould, for a short

period of time, at least a part of that of the
vulcanisation energy which is to be imparted to the

tyre from the outside thereof by an intense heat
transfer,
terminating said heat transfer and then
maintaining the tyre in the mould after said short

period of time, for the time necessary in order for the
vulcanisation reaction to take place,
removing the tyre from its mould.
A method according to Claim 8, wherein, upon
the end of the heat transfer for a given tyre, the

mould containing it is displaced in order to place it
in a waiting space during the time necessary for the

vulcanisation reaction to take place, and, before the
vulcanisation reaction is terminated for said given

tyre, the heat transfer and other operations indicated
for another tyre are started.
A method according to Claim 9, used to treat
during the successive sequences tyres of different

dimensions, in which the time of stay in said waiting
space is identical for all the tyres, the vulcanisation

temperature being adjusted as a function of the size of
each tyre.
A method according to Claim 9, used to treat
during successive sequences tyres of different 

dimensions, in which the time of stay in said waiting
space is adjusted as a function of the size of each

tyre, the vulcanisation temperature being identical for
all the tyres.
A method according to one of Claims 8 to 11,
in which the transfer of energy commences before the

complete closing of the mould.
