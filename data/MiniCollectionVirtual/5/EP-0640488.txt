<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for printing stroke and contone data together 
are provided in which data to be printed (102) is identified by a processor 

(100) as being either stroke or contone data. For contone data, processor 
(100) controls a light source (14), a spatial light modulator (12), and an 

optical photoconductive drum (16) to generate image quality graphics by 
using spatial light modulation in the process and cross-process directions. 

For stroke data, processor (100) controls light source (14), spatial light 
modulator (12), and optical photoconductive drum (16) for high resolution 

printing by using intensity modulation. Processor (100) is operable to control 
light intensities through the use of lookup tables stored in a memory (104).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of printing, and more
particularly to a method and apparatus for printing stroke and contone data
together.Hard copy devices, such as printers, generally print two kinds of data.
The first type of data is stroke data, usually text and graphics data. The
second type of data is continuous tone ("contone") data, which is usually
image data, for example, a data representation of a photographic image.High quality rendering of stroke data requires a printer that can
produce a spatial resolution of 600 dots per inch ("dpi") or more. This
resolution is required, for example, to reduce jaggedness of diagonal edges or
to reproduce fine seriphs in text.Contone data, on the other hand, does not require such high spatial
resolution, but requires a printer than can produce gray shades. Indeed, if
the printer is capable of producing 256 gray shades (which is typical
intensity resolution of image scanners), a 200-250 dpi printer will generally
suffice. Such a printer provides appropriate spatial resolution for the human
eye to perceive smooth shades.Unfortunately, most existing printers are binary printers that can
reproduce only two gray shades, black and white. These printers simulate
more gray shades by logically combining several dots into cells and relying on
the spatial integration property of the human eye to stimulate smooth
shades. As an example, a 3200 dpi printer can achieve appropriate gray
shades by forming cells from 16 X 16 arrays of dots, resulting in 200 cells per 
inch (sometimes referred to as lines per inch). By controlling the number of
dots that are black (or white) in this array, each cell can represent up to 257
gray levels (0 through 256, with 256 represented by all dots being black).
The spatial resolution of the human eye will perceive smooth shades with
such a printer.Thus, binary printers reproduce high quality contone data only at an
extremely high resolution. To produce both contone and stroke data,
therefore, the resolution is defined by the contone image requirements.
Consequently, the stroke data is printed at a higher resolution than needed.
Furthermore, printing at the high resolution needed for contone data with
existing systems makes them expensive.Therefore, a need has arisen for a printer that can print both stroke
and contone data at the resolution of stroke data. EP-A-0 540 221 sets forth a printer using a laser scanning
apparatus and discloses the idea of using "small pixels"
within an "objective pixel" to achieve halftone

A method of printing both stroke and contone data
comprising:


illuminating a spatial light modulator (12) having a
plurality of rows of elements (22-36, 38-52);
using said spatial light modulator elements (22-36, 38-52)
to modulate light in conjunction with movement of a

photoconductive surface (16) having a process direction;
for the contone data,
coordinating the reflection of light from selected

individual elements (22-36, 38-52) of said plurality of rows
of said spatial light modulator (12) with motion of said

photoconductive surface (16), to reflect light on
predetermined areas of said photoconductive surface (16) to form a

contone data pixel that corresponds to that grayscale information;
attracting toner to the areas, the amount of toner
attracted to a particular area being based on the amount of

light that has fallen on that area; and
transferring the toner to a print medium;

wherein
said modulation is performed by said spatial light
modulator elements (22-36, 38-52) in both the process and

cross process directions and
for the stroke data, reflecting light from
predetermined individual elements (22-36, 38-52) onto phases

of a pixel (62), wherein each phase of a pixel (62) is an
area that is smaller than the area of a printed contone data

pixel (60), wherein the placement of the areas is controlled
to produce a resolution higher than the resolution of the 

printed contone data pixels (60), and intensity modulating
the stroke data using said light source (14) illuminating

the spatial light modulator elements (22-36, 38-52) to
control the amount of illumination modulated by said

elements (22-36, 38-52) to form a print image with the
stroke data.
The method of claim 1, further comprising producing the
stroke data at each pixel (62) by reflecting light onto

fewer than all of the phases of a pixel (62).
The method of claim 1, further comprising using staggered
rows of elements of the spatial light modulator (12), and

timing illumination of those rows with the rotation of the

photoconductive surface (16) to provide at least two phases
for each pixel (60) in the cross process direction.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said step of
illuminating comprises pulsing the light such that each

individual element (22-36, 38-52) is operable to reflect
light on at least two area locations in the process

direction.
The method of any of claims 1 to 4, and further
comprising the step of periodically changing the intensity

of the light.
The method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein said step
of reflecting comprises switching the individual elements

(22-36, 38-52) such that each individual element
(22-36, 38-52) is operable to reflect light on at least two

areas in the process direction.
