<ABSTRACT>
A sofa-bed having an articulated folding structure 
comprises a fixed carrying framework (2) to which a main 

movable frame (3) is engaged through a pantograph 
linkage (4), which main frame is movable in a vertical 

direction. Consecutively and rotatably connected to the 
main movable frame (3) are first and second auxiliary 

movable frames (17, 18). An interconnecting lever (20) 
operating between the main movable frame (3) and the 

second auxiliary movable frame (18) interconnects the 
rotational movements of the movable frames (17, 18). A 

synchronization lever (21) operatively connects the 
pantograph linkage (4) to the auxiliary movable frames 

(17, 18) for the purpose of timing the upward and 
downward displacement of the main movable frame (3) with 

the rotations of the auxiliary movable frames (17, 18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sofa-bed with an 
articulated folding structure of the type defined in the 
preamble of claim 1. It is known that sofa-beds with an articulated folding 
structure essentially comprise a fixed carrying 
framework to which three or more movable frames disposed 
consecutively and pivotally engaged with each other are 
linked. The movable frames are shiftable from a closed 
position in which they are folded over upon each other 
and housed within the fixed carrying framework thereby 
defining the conformation of a sofa-bed, to an open or 
unfolded position in which they are extended with 
respect to each other, thereby defining the conformation 
of a bed. In this type of sofa-beds, the sofa back is generally 
fastened to the fixed carrying framework. This involves 
an important reduction in the space that the movable 
frames can use for entering the fixed carrying framework 
and coming out of same, during the closing and opening 
steps respectively of the sofa-bed. For the above 
reason, each of the movable frames is formed with a 
longitudinal extension greatly lower than that of the 
fixed carrying framework within which it is housed in 
the closed position. In addition, on passing from the 
closed position to the open position, the movable frames 
must carry out a starting movement involving a rotation 
and a translation with respect to the fixed carrying 
framework so as to reach a raised and advanced position 
relative to said carrying framework.  
 It is known from US-A-1543103 and from GB-A-429533 a 
bed-couch having a bed frame formed by four frame 
sections: a first section which rotates around the end 
thereof, a second section which moves upwardly and 
forwardly, and a third and a fourth section pivotally 
linked one after the other to the second section.  
 It is apparent from the above that in order to obtain a 
sufficiently wide bed, it is often necessary to use many 
movable frames folded over upon each other, as well as 
very complicated kinematic driving mechanisms. On the  
 
other hand, it will be also recognized that due to the 
presence of many movable frames, the thickness of a 
mattress disposed between said frames is to be greatly 
reduced, which brings about clear inconveniences from 
the point of view of the comfort offered by the 
mattress itself. It is also to be noted that the 
bulkiness of the sofa-bed when opened is caused not only 
by the bed framework, but also, although this is not 
actually necessary, by the sofa back which is rigidly 
ass
