<ABSTRACT>
Described is a stream turbine with a shaft (3) which, at least over part of its length, is located in a housing (4) through which it passes, one end of the housing (4) being the high-pressure end (10) and the opposite end the steam-exhaust end (12). In addition, the housing incorporates a control valve (30) designed to control the rate of steam flow into the housing (4). The invention calls for the shaft bearings to be dry-running, this being achieved by using magnetic bearings (6, 8, 14) located inside the housing (4) at the high-pressure end (10) and at the steam-exhaust end (12). The invention also calls for the control-valve operation to be oil-free, this being achieved by using an electromagnetic actuator (28).

Steam turbine having a shaft (3) arranged at 
least over a part of its length in a housing (4), which 

shaft is guided on the high-pressure side (10) or on 
the opposite waste-steam side (12) of the housing (4) 

through the housing (4), and having at least one 
adjusting valve (30) to adjust the flow of steam 

entering into the housing (4), characterized by an oil-free 
bearing of the shaft (3) by means of magnetic 

bearings arranged within the housing (4) on the high-pressure 
side (10) and on the waste-steam side (12), 

and by an oil-free operation of the at least one 
adjusting valve (30) by means of at least one 

electromagnetic actuating drive (28). 
Steam turbine according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the magnetic bearing on the high-pressure 

side (10) comprises a radial bearing (6) and 
an axial bearing (14). 
Steam turbine according to claim 2, 
characterized in that apart from the radial bearing (6) 

and the axial bearing (14) a catch bearing (16) is 
provided, preferably arranged between these two. 
Steam turbine according to one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the high-pressure side (10) or 

the waste-steam side (12) is closed in a steam-tight 
manner by a cover (23). 
Steam turbine according to one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that on the high-pressure side (10) 

of the housing (4) a seal (22) is provided, whereby the 
radial and axial magnetic bearings are arranged in 

front of this seal (22) when seen from the waste-steam 
side (12). 
Steam turbine according to one of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that on the waste-steam side (12) 

within the housing (4) an additional catch bearing (18) 
is provided, whereby an additional seal (24) provided  

 
on the waste-steam side (12) is arranged in the 

direction of the flow of the steam in front of or 
between, preferably behind, the magnetic bearing (8) 

and the catch bearing (18). 
Steam turbine according to one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the electromagnetic actuating 

drive (28) is likewise arranged within the housing (4). 
Steam turbine according to one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the electromagnetic actuating 

drive (28) comprises an iron yoke (32) and a coil (34) 
as well as a magnet armature (38) connected to a push 

rod (36).
