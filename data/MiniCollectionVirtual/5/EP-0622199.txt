<ABSTRACT>
Wiping and capping method and apparatus for use with 
an inkjet printer (100) are described. The apparatus 

includes a sled (503) that is mounted to a printer's 
chassis (501). Caps (702a) and wipers (703a) can be 

mounted on the sled (503) for each of the printer's 
movable carriage-mounted printheads. The sled (503) and 

the chassis (501) are cam-coupled for controlled, relative 
movement therebetween. The sled (503) and the carriage 

(102) are also cam-coupled for controlled, relative 
movement therebetween. Movement of the carriage (102) 

produces slight vertical and lateral movement of the sled 
(503) out of its nominal position to place it in three 

primary positions relative to the carriage (102): an 
elevated position for capping the printheads, an 

intermediate position for wiping the printheads and a 
lowered position for free reciprocal movement of the 

carriage (102) without interference between the printheads 
and either the caps (702a) or the wipers (703a). The sled 

(503) is mounted to ensure constant capping force between 
the caps (702a) and their corresponding printheads. The 

invented method involves uncapping the printheads, wiping 
the printheads uni-directionally, lowering the sled (503) 

to its free position beneath the printheads, optionally 
re-wiping the printheads repeatedly, and returning the 

printheads to their capped position. The method and 
apparatus are compatible with automatic failure recovery 

techniques to unclog printheads, including spitting and 
priming. The structure according to the invention can be 

easily and quickly assembled and disassembled by a method 
according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to inkjet
printers and, in particular, to a method and structure for
wiping and capping the printheads of one or more print
cartridges. More particularly, the invention relates to a
method and structure that depends upon printer carriage
motion for automatic wiping and capping of each printhead,
that utilizes uni-directional, separate wiping action for each
printhead, that caps each printhead with a constant capping
force and that reduces noise associated with operation of the
capping and wiping structure.Inkjet printhead nozzles commonly become plugged with
ink blobs or particulate therein, or otherwise contaminated
with internal bubbles that prevent them from operating
properly. Lower print quality and user complaints often
result. Conventional service mechanisms typically provide for
the spitting, wiping and capping of single printheads,
frequently require operator intervention and often take the
printer off-line for several seconds. Wiping an inkjet
printhead in two directions, or wiping multiple printheads
with a single wiper surface, results in recontamination of a
printhead during wiping or inter-printhead contamination.Improved capping systems have been proposed that provide
for constant-force, rather than constant-deflection, capping
of plural printheads in inkjet printers.Failure recovery methods and systems have been
proposed that provide for the automatic recovery from a
condition in a plural printhead inkjet printer in which the
printhead's nozzles become clogged with ink and particulate
wherein the method includes capping the printheads,
selectively priming and flushing a given printhead and then
uncapping and wiping the printheads.Movement of a sled in a service station often results in
impacts between the sled and surrounding parts of the printer.
The impacts create undesirable levels of noise during
operation of the printer. Previously, wiper blades have been made of rubber.
However, "shingling" of the wiper blades can result after
prolonged used of the wiper blades, particularly in low
humidity and low temperature environments. Shingling is a
microscopic defect on the surface of the wiper blade that,
during wiping, can cause air bubbles to be transmitted
into the nozzles of the print cartridge. These air
bubbles can cause ink to be displace from the firing
chamber of the print cartridge so that the print
cartridges will not print, necessitating priming of the
print cartridge in order to restore printing capability.Additionally, in previous wiping

A service station (500) for use with an inkjet printer (100), the printer
including a chassis (501) and print carriage (102) movably supported on the chassis,

the printer also including a carriage controller for moving the print carriage with
respect to the chassis, a print cartridge including a printhead through which ink is

ejected being mounted in the print carriage, the service station comprising:

a sled body (701), a wiper mount (701b) and a cam surface (503b) being
formed on the sled body;
sled body mounting means (502) for movably mounting the sled body, the
sled body mounting means adapted to be mounted on the chassis;
a wiper structure (703) including a wiper (703a), the wiper being mounted on
the wiper mount, a wiping edge of the wiper distal from a surface (701c) of the

sled body; and
a cam coupler (504) adapted to be detachably attached to the chassis adjacent
to the sled body, a cam follower extension (504c) being formed on the cam

coupler,

wherein motion of the print carriage, in conjunction with contact between the
cam surface and cam follower extension, positions the sled body so that the

wiping edge contacts the printhead.
Structure as in Claim 1, wherein:

the wiper mount (701b) is a protrusion formed on a surface of the sled body
(701); and
the wiper (703a) is formed with a cavity, the wiper (703a) being mounted on
the wiper mount (701b) such that the wiper mount (701b) is within the wiper

cavity.
Structure as in Claims 1 or 2, further comprising a slot (504b) formed in the
cam coupler to make the cam coupler cam follower extension part of a flexible

member (504d) such that noise resulting from impact between the sled body cam
surface and the cam coupler cam follower extension is reduced.
Structure as in Claims 1, 2 or 3, further comprising a bumper (802) formed at
the base of the wiper structure such that when the sled body moves so as to impact a

(702a) of the plurality of caps being mounted on a corresponding one of the

plurality of cap mounts; and
the wipers are located adjacent to and alternately with the caps in a row.
Structure as in Claims 7 or 8, wherein a blade section (803c) of a wiper (801d)
for wiping the printhead of a print cartridge containing pigmented ink is made stiffer

than blade sections (803c) of other wipers (801a, 801b, 801c).
A method for assembling a service station (500) for use with an inkjet printer
(100), the printer including a chassis (501) and a print carriage (102) movably

supported on the chassis, the printer also including a carriage controller for moving
the print carriage with respect to the chassis, a print cartridge (105a) including a

mounting a cam coupler (504) on the chassis adjacent to the sled body, a cam
follower extension (504c) being formed on the cam coupler such that motion

of the print carriage, in conjunction with contact between the cam surface and
cam follower extension, positions the sled body so that the wiping edge

contacts the printhead.
Structure as in Claim 1, wherein the cam coupler (504) has legs (504e) formed
on a first end thereof and threaded holes (504f) on an end of the cam coupler (504)

opposite the first end, the legs (504e) fitting into corresponding holes within chassis
