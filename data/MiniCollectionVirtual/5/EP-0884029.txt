<ABSTRACT>
An expandable intraluminal endoprosthesis comprising a tubular member (1) a first
diameter which permits intraluminal delivery of the member into a lumen of a body

passageway, particularly a blood vessel. The tubular member (1) is capable of acquiring
a second, expanded and deformed diameter upon the application from the interior of the

tubular member of a radially outwardly extending force, which second diameter is
variable and dependent on the amount of said force applied to the tubular member. Such

a tubular member may be expanded and deformed to expand the lumen of the body
passageway. According to the invention the wall of said tubular member comprises a

substantially continuous structure (2) of mutually staggered undulations. Said structure
has been separated from a tube wall and exhibits at least one pattern which advances

substantially helically along a longitudinal axis of the tubular body. Connection
elements within the structure connect adjacent undulations to each other. These

connection elements are an integral extension of the undulations thereby interconnected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an expandable intraluminal endoprosthesis comprising a
tubular member having a first and second end and a wall surface disposed between said
first and second end, the wall having a substantially uniform thickness and having a first
diameter in a first, unexpanded state which permits intraluminal delivery of the member
into a lumen of a body passageway, particularly a blood vessel, which member is
capable of acquiring a second diameter in an expanded and deformed state upon the
application from the interior of the tubular member of a radially outwardly extending
force, which second diameter is variable and dependent on the amount of said force
applied to the tubular member, whereby the tubular member may be expanded and
deformed to expand the lumen of the body passageway, at least part of the wall of said
tubular member comprising a structure of mutually staggered undulations which has
been separated from a substantially solid tube wall of a hollow tube during manufacture
by removing material from said substantially solid tube wall. More particularly the
invention relates to an expandable intraluminal vascular endoprosthesis which is
especially useful for repairing or reconstructing blood vessels narrowed or occluded by a
disease. Commonly this kind of medical device is referred to as vascular stent or graft.Stents are prosthetic devices which are implanted inside a lumen in order to provide
support for its wall and to assure an undisturbed flow through the lumen. This is
particularly important in the field of angioplasty which is concerned with the repair and
reconstruction of blood vessels. In that particular field stents are implanted within the
vascular system to reinforce collapsing, partially occluded, weakened, or abnormally
dilated sections of blood vessels. More generally, however, stents can be used inside the
lumen of any physiological conduit or duct including the arteries, veins, bile ducts, the
urinary tract, alimentary tracts, the tracheobronchial tree, a cerebral aqueduct and the
genitourinary system. Moreover stents can be used inside lumina of animals besides
humans.Generally two types of stents may be distinguished. First there are self-expandable stents
which automatically expand once they are released to assume a permanent deployed,
expanded state. These stents expand to a defined diameter and are unable to remodel the 
true vascular anatomy over lengths greater than 2 cm. Their drawback is that the
physician needs to place the right device and
