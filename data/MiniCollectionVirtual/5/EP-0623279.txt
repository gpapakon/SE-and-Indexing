<ABSTRACT>
The moulding process comprises the following steps:   a) pouring the mixture of curd and whey into a means (3) forming a distributor; b) filling a hopper (5) with the mixture, the hopper including openings (16) located above a series of leaktight moulding cells (11)   c) moving the hopper (5) and the series of cells (11) with respect to each other.   The moulding device makes it possible to fill the cells (11) uniformly.

A cheese moulding method to mould a mixture of
curdled milk and whey in a series of moulding cavities

(11) characterised in that it comprises the steps of:

a) pouring the mixture of curdled milk and whey
into a feeding chute (3),
b) filling a hopper (5) comprising a row of
openings (16) located above the series of cavities (11)

with said mixture, and
c) displacing the hopper (5) and the series of
cavities (11) with respect to one another so as to fill

the moulding cavities (11).
A method in accordance with claim 1,
characterised in that the displacement of the hopper (5)

and series of cavities (11) with respect to one another
is a back and forth movement.
A method in accordance with claim 2,
characterised in that it comprises a step (d) of

increasing the volume of the cavities between each back
and forth displacement during step (c).
A method in accordance with one of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that, during step (c), the hopper (5)

is stationary and the series of cavities (11) is driven
back and forth below said hopper (5).
A method in accordance with one of claims 2 to
4, characterised in that the displacement velocity and

the number of back and forth movements of the hopper (5)
and the series of cavities (11) with respect to one

another are predetermined.
A method in accordance with one of claims 1 to
5, characterised in that it comprises a whey removal step

before step (b). 
A method in accordance with one of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that it further comprises the

following steps:

e) positioning a series of moulds (13)
substantially above the series of moulding cavities (11)

before the end of step (c), and
f) filling the moulds (13) with the mixture of
curdled milk and whey contained in the series of moulding

cavities (11) after step (c).
A method in accordance with claim 7,
characterised in that each mould (13) is arranged below a

respective moulding cavity (11).
A method in accordance with one of claims 1 to
8, characterised in that the filling of the hopper (5) is

performed in a continuous manner and is interrupted in
the course of the execution of step (c).
A method in accordance with one of claims 1 to
9, characterised in that the hopper (5) contains a

certain quantity of said mixture throughout the duration
of step (c).
A method in accordance with claim 10,
characterised in that, at the end of step (c), the value

of the quantity of said mixture contained in the hopper
(5) is compared with a reference value, the comparison

value obtained being used to adjust the value of the
volume attained by the moulding cavities (11) at the end

of step (c) for the following implementation of said
method.
A method in accordance with claim 7,
characterised in that the volume attained by the moulding

cavities (11) is adjusted according to the value of the
weight of the whey collected during steps (a) to (f) of

said method and the value of the weight of the moulds
(13) filled after step (f). 
A moulding device to implement the method in
accordance with one of claims 1 to 12, comprising a

recipient (1), intended to contain a mixture of curdled
milk and whey, and a series of moulding cavities (11),

characterised in that it comprises a feeding chute (3)
into which the content of said recipient (1) is poured, a

hopper (5) comprising a row of openings (16) located
above the series of moulding cavities (11), and arranged

at the outlet of the feeding chute (3), and displacement
means designed to displace the hopper (5) and the series

of moulding cavities (11) with respect to one another.
A device in accordance with claim 13,
characterised in that the feeding chute (3) is an

inclined chute (3) whose bottom has a corrugated surface
defining grooves (4) extending substantially parallel to

the direction of inclination of said chute (3) and
diverging from the width of the recipient (1) t
o the
width of the hopper (5).
A device in accordance with one of claims 13
or 14, characterised in that the moulding cavities (11)

are arranged side by side on a plane forming a rectangle.
A device in accordance with one of claims 13
to 15, characterised in that the cavities are permeable

to whey.
A device in accordance with claim 15,
characterised in that the feeding chute (3) has an outlet

end whose width is substantially equal to the length of
one side of said rectangle perpendicular to the direction

of displacement (F) of the hopper (5) and the series of
moulding cavities (11) with respect to one another.
A device in accordance with one of claims 13
to 17, characterised in that it further comprises a whey

removal means (6) consisting of an inclined surface (6)
permeable to whey arranged upstream from the hopper (5). 
A device in accordance with one of claims 13
to 18, characterised in that the hopper (5) comprises, at

its openings (16), profiled teeth (15) extending parallel
to the direction of displacement (F) of the hopper (5)

and the series of cavities (11) with respect to one
another and towards the interior of the hopper (5).
A device in accordance with claim 19,
characterised in that said profiled teeth (15) are

arranged substantially in line with the spaces (17)
separating two adjacent cavities (11).
A device in accordance with one of claims 13
to 20, characterised in that the openings (16) of the
