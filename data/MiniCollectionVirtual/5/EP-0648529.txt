<ABSTRACT>
The rotary drum (1) has a cylindrical portion (tubular body portion) (2) 
formed therein with vent holes (16). An annular duct (24) is disposed at the 

outside of the cylindrical portion (2) of the rotary drum (1) in a manner to 
surround the cylindrical portion (2). This annular duct (24) is provided with a 

gas supply duct (31) and an exhaust duct (32). In the annular duct (24), 
partition walls (25a and 25b) define a vent path
 (24a), in which the drying gas 
which has been supplied from the gas supply duct (31) flows through an 

accumulated layer (33), and thereafter, flows to the exhaust duct (32). The 
direction of flow of the drying gas in the vent path (24a) is changed over by 

gas supply-exhaust changeover dampers (36 and 37).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a granular material coating apparatus, and
more particularly to a granular material coating apparatus for coating on
granular materials such as tablets, granules and the like used for
pharmaceuticals and food products.As an apparatus for applying a sugar-coating or film-coating on the
surfaces of the granular materials used as articles to be coated such as
the tablets, granules used for the pharmaceuticals, nuts, confectionery and
the like, there have been utilized a conventional coating pan and the like
in the past. However, nowadays, there are mainly used coating
apparatuses of the type in which air is made to flow through an
accumulated layer of the articles coated in order to facilitate drying of the
coated articles.The coating apparatus of this type includes a coating pan rotatable
about a horizontal shaft and is formed therein with a multiplicate air duct
holes. Coating solution and binder solution are sprayed from a spray
nozzle onto the granular materials as the articles coated, which is supplied
into a coating chamber of this coating pan under the rotation of the coating
pan.The type of the coating apparatus, in which the air is made to flow
through the accumulated layer formed in the bottom portion of the coating 
chamber for drying the coated articles, is broadly divided into two
categories. The first one is the category in which an exhaust duct for
exhausting drying air in the coating chamber to the outside is fixed to a
support base, and an opening portion of the exhaust duct is provided in
opposing to the outer peripheral surface of the coating pan in sliding
contact therewith. The second one is the category in which the exhaust
duct extending in parallel to a rotatable shaft of the coating pan is secured
to the outer peripheral surface of the coating pan.As the coating apparatus of the first category, there is one described
in the Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 51-18397
(corresponding to the U.S. Patent No. 3,573,966), which has been sold at
the market under a trade name of "Accelacoater". This coating apparatus
is constructed such that there is provided a rotary drum formed in a
cylindrical portion thereof with a multiplicate holes and there is disposed
an exhaust device connecting to an opening portion which is in sliding
contact with the outer periphery of this rotary drum in opposing to the
accumulated layer of tablets. The air in the rotary drum is sucked by this
exhaust device, so that the air which has flowed in from the outer
periphery of the
