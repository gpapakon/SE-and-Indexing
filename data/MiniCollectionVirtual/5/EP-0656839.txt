<ABSTRACT>
An engine traction control system generates a control cycle of a varying duty cycle which controls the pressure level in a pneumatic actuator in the engine power control (46) linkage to thereby reduce engine power when the driven wheels (24, 28) begin slipping during the vehicle acceleration. The duty cycle is set as a function of wheel speed error between the average wheel speeds of the driven and nondriven wheels (16, 20), and also as a function of the change in the error between calculation cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine traction control 
system in which the power of the engine is reduced when the 
vehicle is accelerated and the driven wheels of the vehicle 
begin slipping. Prior art traction control systems are known in which, 
upon slipping of one of the driven wheels of the vehicle during 
vehicle acceleration, the power output generated by the engine 
is controlled to less than that demanded by the vehicle 
operator and in which the brake controls the slipping wheel. 
While two separate controls are involved (engine throttle and 
braking), prior art systems provided interactions between the 
throttle and brake controls so that inconsistent performance 
was realised. Furthermore, the control of the engine throttle 
in most prior art systems is unrelated to wheel speed. In such 
prior art systems, the throttle is reduced by a predetermined 
amount, or the throttle is reduced by an amount that is 
dependent upon some other variable, such as the braking 
pressure being applied by the brake control. A typical prior 
art system is disclosed in US-A-4,955,448. US-A-5,248,010 and its equivalent EP-A-0,485,779 disclose 
a method of controlling wheel slippage as a function of the 
difference between wheel speed of the driven wheel and a 
velocity reference to control drive torque. The specific rate 
of change of the drive torque is proportional to the rate of 
change of slippage, and while adequate for many applications 
however some spikes may occur in the application to the drive  
 
torque. The specific algorithm used develops a target speed 
for the driven wheels based on the theory of wheel slip. The 
driven wheel speeds are permitted to slip a prescribed amount 
above the vehicle speed reference developed from the non-driven 
wheel speeds. The prescribed slip amount is added to the 
vehicle reference speed to create the driven wheel target 
speed. The drive axle wheel speeds are subsequently controlled 
to be as close to the target speed as possible. As used herein, the term "throttle" or "throttle control" 
is used in its broadest possible sense, and includes, for 
example, control of a fuel management system for the engine, 
and is not limited to control of a throttle valve in a 
carbureted engine. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a method of controlling wheel slippage upon 
acceleration of a motor vehicle having an engine controlled by 
a power control, said vehicle having driven wheels driven by 
said engine and non-driven wheels, the method
