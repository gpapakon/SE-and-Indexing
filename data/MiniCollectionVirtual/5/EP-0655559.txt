<ABSTRACT>
A pin-type fastener (11,12) capable of dual-function 
comprises a pin (11) which can be used in fastening 

workpieces (24, 27) together. The pin (11) has a pintail 
(17) capable of being removed from the remainder (15) of 

the pin (11) after the pin (11) has been installed as a 
fastener in a workpiece, and the pintail (17) can then be 

used as a weldstud and welded to the same workpiece as 
the pin-type fastener, or to another workpiece. The pin-type 

fastner can be a two-part fastener, for example a 
lockbolt including a nut or swageable collar engageable 

with the pin. The pin (11) may have a- breakneck (16) to 
facilitate removal of the pintail (17). The pin (11) 

itself may be a weldstud. In use, the pin-type fastener 
(11, 12) is installed in a workpiece (27) and the pintail 

(17) is removed, and then the pintail (17) is used as a 
weldstud, being welded to a workpiece (36). Electric 

welding is employed. Advantage:- economy through second 
use of pintail as a stud.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pin-type fasteners with removable pintails are, in
general, well known. In use of the fastener, the pintail
is gripped by a first part (e.g. in the form of a set of
jaws) of an installation tool, a second part (e.g. in the
form of an annular anvil) of the tool engages a second
part of the fastener ( e.g. in the form of a collar or
shell), and the tool is activated (e.g. by hydraulic
power) to retract the first part of the tool relative to
the second part of the tool, thereby to cause the second
part of the tool to deform one or both parts of the
fastener.The effect of such deformation may be to clamp two or
more workpieces together, and/or to secure one or other or
both parts of the fastener to a workpiece, and/or to lock
the two parts of the fastener to each other, depending
upon the design of the fastener.After such locking engagement has been achieved, it
is usually necessary to remove the pintail because it
protrudes beyond the second part of the installed
fastener. However, such removal can be made to serve the
useful function of ensuring that sufficient force has been
applied to the fastener by the tool to achieve
satisfactory deformation. This is arranged by taking the
reaction to the deforming load as tension load on the
pintail, and by designing and manufacturing the pin so 
that it fractures at a tension load of a predetermined value, or
of not less than a minimum predetermined value.The pin is alternatively known as a stem, and such
fasteners are also known as breakstem fasteners.Various examples of such fasteners are described in
patent specifications GB 424241, GB 629098 (commercially
available under the trademark AVDELOK), GB 1 029 654
(commercially available under the trademark AVEX), GB
1538872 (commercially available under the trademark
MONOBOLT), and GB 2227538 (commercially
available under the trademark MAXLOK).As explained in GB 424241 at page 3 lines 119 to 128,
the locking grooves on the pin could be spiral (or rather
helical) form so as to provide a screwthread, so that the two
parts of the installed fastener can later be unscrewed apart.Some of the above - identified fasteners incorporate a
preformed enlarged head which is formed integrally with the
pin at the end thereof remote from the pintail. An article
entitled "Pin and Collar Bolt is Removable, Reusable "on
page 90 of "Machine Design" for 10 September 1987
describes and illustrates a variant form of fastener, in which
the integral preformed head is replaced by a removable nut in 
threaded engagement with the end of the pin
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of using a dual-function fastener of the
pin-type including a removable pintail (17), comprising first

installing the fastener and removing the pintail (17),
characterised in that the pintail (17) is then used as a

weldstud.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
the step of installing the fastener comprises welding the

pin (11) to a workpiece (24).
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that
the fastener includes a deformable part (12) and the step of installing the fastener fastener further

comprises deforming the deformable part (12) of the fastener to secure a
second workpiece (27) to the first workpiece (24).
A method of using a dual-function fastener of the
pin-type including a removable pintail (17) and a deformable part (12), comprising the

steps of:

firstly welding the end (14) of the pin (11) remote from the
pintail (17) to a
 first workpiece (24);
then deforming the deformable part (12) of the fastener to secure a
second workpiece (27) to the first workpiece (24);
and then removing the pintail (17) from the installed
fastener;

   characterised in that the removed pintail (17) is then
used as a weldstud, and is welded to the same or another

workpiece (36). 
A dual-function fastener in the form of a pin-type
fastener comprising a pin (11) having a pintail (17), characterised

in that the pintail (17) is a weldstud which is capable of
being removed from the remainder of the pin (11) after initial

installation of the fastener, and which can thereafter be
used as a weldstud.
A dual-function fastener as claimed in claim 5, in
which the pin (11) itself is a weldstud.
