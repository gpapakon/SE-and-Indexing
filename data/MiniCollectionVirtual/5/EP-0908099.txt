<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with the use of NPV-Baculoviruses for the eradication
of 
Heliothis armigera
 larvae, and especially with the use of the special virus strain
NBIMCC No 3538. The invention has also for object an insecticide composition

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the use of insect diseases as natural insecticide for
pest control. This use is of increasing interest for its safe and ecological
performance, especially in food directly consumed by humans.Diseased insects are present in every population. Sometimes, they are rare, in other
cases, a standard number of animals is infected without apparent mortality ; and in
other cases, microbes cause outbreaks with very important mortality (=epizootics).
The diseases participate with other factors in the natural biological reduction of the
number of animals and are normally density dependent. The disease, considered as
a state in which the body, or a tissue or organ of the body, is disturbed either
functionally or structurally or both, may be infectious, that is, caused by a
pathogen, or non-infectious, caused by abiotic factors (temperature, starvation,
physical injury...).Most common pathogens causing insect epizootics are fungi, bacteria, protozoa
and viruses. All of them are useful, to some extent, in Biological Pest Control. But
insect viruses, especially the genus Baculovirus, have been identified as having the
best potential for microbial pest control, due to their high specificity and lack of
undesirable effects (Maramorosch and Sherman, In Viral Insecticides for
Biological Control, Academic press, p.109, 1985). There are many different types
of viruses associated with insects and, more generally, to invertebrates. At present,
more than 1100 viruses of invertebrates have been reported, but this number may
be the tip of the iceberg, since more than 80 % of the animals are invertebrates and
have not been thoroughly studied (Adams, In Atlas of Invertebrates viruses, CRC
Press, p.87-204, 1991).Invertebrate viruses are unique. In some virus groups, the virions or nucleocapsids
are occluded in a crystalline protein matrix called viral occlusion body. Into these,
the family Baculoviridae, members of which are totally restricted to invertebrates,
is the most economically interesting for use as biological insecticides.
Baculoviruses are rod-shaped (baculo = rod) enveloped viruses containing double-strained
DNA, that are normally occluded in protein crystals. The most important
types of the genus are Nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) and Granulosis virus 
(GV), that can be distinguished by the number of viral particles occluded and the
shape of the viral occlusion : polyhedral in the NPV, and granular or capsular-shaped
in the GV. These viruses are restricted to the Lepidoptera group of
