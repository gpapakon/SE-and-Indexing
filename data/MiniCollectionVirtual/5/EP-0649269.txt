<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a speaker enclosure (1) with extended spatial diffusion, which enclosure comprises at least two acoustic transducers which, each having a favoured acoustic emission axis (2A), are oriented in such a way that their favoured emission axes are themselves oriented in different directions (D1 to D4), particularly divergent directions when they are viewed in projection in an angular orientation sector defined in space. It is characterised in that the various transducers with the favoured emission axes (2A) oriented in different directions (D1 to D4) are arranged with their points (7) called "point source base" situated on a line, called base line, which extends in a substantially midplane and is perpendicular to that of the angular sector in question.

A speaker enclosure (1) with extended spatial diffusion, said enclosure comprising at
least two sound transducers (2) which, each having a preferred sound-transmission axis

(2A), have transmission spectra that overlap at least locally and are oriented in such a
way that their preferred-transmission axes are oriented in different directions (D1 to D4),

notably diverging when they are observed in projection in an angular sector (S) of defined
spatial orientation,


the transducers being arranged in a column (10) with a longitudinal axis (10A)
approximately orthogonal to the said angular sector S,
each of these transducers (2) exhibiting a notable imaginary point (7) which, being
called a "equivalent point source base", is situated, particularly axially to the transducer,

generally at a certain distance D beyond the front face (9A) of a membrane (9) which the
said transducer (2) comprises,

this enclosure being 
CHARACTERISED
 in that the various transducers with preferred
transmission axes (2A) oriented in different directions (D1 to D4) are arranged with their

points (7) called "point source base" situated on a line (L) called a base line, which
extends in a plane (P) substantially median and perpendicular to that of the angular sector

under consideration (S).
A speaker enclosure according to Claim 1, the transducers of which are each driven by an
external signal, 
characterised
 in that the various transducers are driven by the same
signal:


on the one hand, to produce sounds of frequencies situated within a defined range and,
on the other hand, so as to be in acoustic phase.
A speaker enclosure according to Claim 1 or 2 and composed of a cabinet (3) comprising
a wall (4) which defines several external faces, including a front face (5), that is, a face

intended to be turned towards listeners, and in which there are arranged at least two slots

(6) at the periphery of each of which a sound transducer (2) is connected, furthermore
essentially internal to the cabinet (3), 
characterised
 in that the cabinet (3) of the 
enclosure (1) is composed of at least two boxes (11) which, each screening a sound

transducer (2), each exhibit:

in order to be supported on another box, at least one external surface (12) called a
support surface, which is approximately orthogonal to the line (L) on which the points (7)

called "point source base" must be arranged and
in order to carry a transducer (2), at least indirectly, a surface (13) called a front surface,
provided with a slot (6) to which this transducer (2) is connected, moreover internal to the

said box, the said front surface (13) being approximately parallel to the base line (L) in its
portion which crosses this box (11).
A speaker enclosure according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised
 by, for the
purpose of relative orientation of each box in relation to another around the base line (L),

at least one element of a means (14) of orientation and of positioning to this effect,
comprising two complementary elements.
A speaker enclosure according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised
 in that:

the front surface (13) of each box (11) is substantially plane and it exhibits edges (13A)
which determine a rectangular quadrilateral,
to this front surface (13), on two opposite edges thereof, there is substantially connected
a lateral surface (15) in the form of an approximately cylindrical revolution envelope.
A speaker enclosure according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised
 in that the
different boxes (11) of an enclosure cabinet have, in a plane parallel to the support surface

(12) of the box, substantially an identical section, in such a way that, when they are
superimposed, they present their lateral surfaces (15) approximately in continuity, while

they are oriented differently so that each presents their front surface (13) in a direction
determined in relation to at least one other box of the enclosure.
A speaker enclosure according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised
 in that the
slot (6) made in each front face (13) to constitute the opening in which a transducer (2)

emerges, at a position determined essentially in relation to those of its edges at which the
lateral surface (15) is connected, as a function of the relative orientation of each box in

relation to at least one other box (11) of the enclosure. 
A speaker enclosure according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised
 in that the
different boxes (11) making up the same enclosure comprise, in their wall presenting the

support surfaces (12), at least one slot (12A) which constitutes a broad passage placing
the internal volumes of the boxes (11) in communication.
An assembly comprising at least two enclosures according to any one of Claims 1 to 8
and of a type producing sounds in different frequency ranges, 
characterised
 in that, to
make up the assembly, the enclosures are superimposed in such a way that the base

points (7) of the transducers which the transducers comprise are situated on a base line
(L) which extends in a plane substantially median and perpendicular to that of the angular

sector (S) in which the enclosures are presumed to be omnidirectional.
