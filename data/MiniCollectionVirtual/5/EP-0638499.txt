<ABSTRACT>
1. To join a new web (13), which is to be drawn off from a new reel (12), to an ongoing web (10) which is drawn off from an ongoing reel (11) and is made of packaging material, a free end, namely an end piece (25), of the new web (13) is seized by a draw-off element (20) and is drawn in one conveying cycle as far as into the region of a joining unit (18). The ongoing web (10) also runs through the joining unit (18). 2. In the region of the joining unit (18), the two webs are laid one on another and are together severed by a severing knife (41). After the removal of a web piece (45) of the ongoing web (10), web end (32) and web start (33) are exposed. A joining strip (47) can be brought, from the free side, against the two webs and into contact with the latter.

Process for connecting material webs of packaging 
material, namely a web beginning (33) of a material web - 

new web (13) - wound as a bobbin - new bobbin (12) - to 
a web end (32) of a material web - runoff web (10) - 

running off from another bobbin - runoff bobbin (11), the 
web beginning (33) of the new web (13) being moved by a 

drawing-off member (20) into a region of a connecting 
assembly (18) and being connected, in the region of the 

connecting assembly (18), to the web end (32) of the 
runoff web (10) by adhesive bonding or the like, 

characterized by the following process steps: 

a) the web beginning (33) of the new web (13) is 
gripped on the circumference of the new bobbin (12) 

by the drawing-off member (20), 
b) the web beginning (33) is then drawn off from the 
new bobbin (12), to be precise a web portion (29) 

being drawn off, in a single conveying cycle into 
the region of the connecting assembly (18) and 

beyond this, 
c) the new web (13) is retained until the new web 
(13) is connected to the runoff web (10), 
d) the web portion (29) of the new web (13) and a 
region of the runoff web (10) are laid against one 

another and severed jointly, such that the web end 
(32) of the runoff web (10) and the web beginning 

(33) of the new web (13) are located adjacent to one 
another, 
e) finally, the web end (32) and the web beginning 
(33) are connected to one another. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, after being separated off from the new web (13), 

the web portion (29) is conveyed away by the drawing-off 
member (20). 
Apparatus for connecting material webs of packaging 
material, namely a web beginning (33) of a new web 

(13), which is drawn off from a new bobbin (12) by a 
drawing-off member (20), to a web end (32) of a runoff 

web (10), running off from a runoff bobbin (11), in the 
region of a connecting assembly (18), having a conveyor 

which exhibits a retaining means for gripping a free end 
piece (25) of the new web (13), characterized in that the 

retaining means, along with the new web (13) or a web 
portion (29) of the new web (13), can be conveyed by the 

conveyor through the connecting assembly (18). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the drawing-off member (20) is configured as a fixed 

pivot arm (21) which can be moved in an upright plane and 
at the free end of which the retaining means for gripping 

the end piece (25) of the new web (13) is fitted. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the retaining means for gripping 

the end piece (25) of the new web (13) is a rotatable 
receiving roller (22) which exhibits suction bores (23) 

for gripping the new web (13) and onto which an end piece 
(25) of the new web (13) can be wound in order to retain 

said new web. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the retaining 

means, in particular the receiving roller (22), along 
with the web portion (29) of the new web (13), can be 

moved, in the region of the connecting assembly (18), 
along the underside of a pressure plate (31) such that 

the web portion (29) rests, in the end position, on the 

underside of the pressure plate (31). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that, in the region of the connecting assembly (18), the 

new web (13) or the web portion (29) is retained on the 
underside of the fixed pressure plate (31) by suction  

 
air, and in that the runoff web (10) which is guided 

beneath the new web (13) can be pressed against said new 
web (13) or the pressure plate (31) by a pressure piece 

(36) which can be moved upwards out of a bottom position. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that, for the purpose of severing the abutting runoff web 

(10) and new web (13) in the region of the pressure plate 
(31), a transversely movable cutter (41) is arranged on 

that side of the pressure piece (36) which is directed 
towards the new bobbin (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the cutter (41) is fitted on a displaceable carriage 

(43) which is displaceably mounted on guide rods (44) 
which are directed transversely with respect to the 

runoff web (10) and new web (13). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that a connecting strip (47) can be conveyed, by means of 

a strip-applying means (48) fitted pivotably on a carrying 
piece (39), against the free web end (32) and the 

likewise free web beginning (33) in order to connect web 
end (32) and web beginning (33) to one another, it being 

possible for the strip-applying means (48) to be moved up 
and down together with the carrying piece (39), and the 

strip-applying means (48), in a bottom end position, 
receiving the connecting strip (47) from a transfer 

member (50) and being pivotable in a top end position 
against web end (32) and web beginning (33).
