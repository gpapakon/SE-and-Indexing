<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dermal uses of non-irritating 
retinoids and particularly to dermal uses of 
the esters and amides of certain stereoisomers of retinoic 
acid. Chronic sun exposure has been determined to create a 
number of skin disorders including skin cancer which is 
usually discernible by the presence of lesions known as 
keratoses as well as photoaging (or "dermatoheliosis") of 
the skin which is characterized by wrinkling, sallowness, 
roughness and mottled pigmentation. In a recent article 
entitled, "Topical Tretinoin Improves Photoaged Skin," 
JAMA 259, vol.4, pgs. 527-532, Jan. 22/29, 1988, the 
authors Webb et al. report that photoaging of the skin of 
middle-aged and elderly Caucasians could be improved 
within a 16-week period by daily topical application of a 
cream containing 0.1% tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid). A side effect reported in the article which 
complicates the administration of tretinoin, is that the 
therapy is irritating to the skin and induces dermatitis 
of several weeks duration in almost all of the subjects 
undergoing the tretinoin therapy. Redness, peeling, 
stinging, burning and dryness were consistently 
experienced by nearly all subjects. Eleven of fifteen 
subjects experienced dermatitis severe enough to require 
the use of topical steroids to control the dermatitis. 
Three of fifteen withdrew from the tretinoin therapy due 
to the severity of the tretinoin-induced dermatitis. Also 
positive effects on the histology of the epidermal and 
stratum corneum layers of the dorsal forearm skin were 
noted in the tretinoin treated areas. Because of these 
side effects, recommendation for use of the therapy is 
inhibited and is not used to full advantage. A method of 
dermal therapy that would retain the effectiveness of 
tretinoin but which would be essentially non-irritating 
would provide a much needed solution to the treatment of  
 
photoaging. Further, non-irritating effective treatment 
of other skin disorders such as skin cancer would meet a 
long felt need in dermal therapy. The present invention is directed to a method for 
retarding and reversing the effects of skin cancer and 
photoaging without the inducement of dermatitis wherein 
there is applied topically to the epidermis of the skin a 
non-irritating retinoid comprised of the esters and amides 
of 13-trans-retinoic acid, 
the retinoids having the formula: 
wherein R is 
wherein X is -H, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -OH, -OR, -OR', 
-CN, -NO₂, -NH₂, -NHR', or -NR'₂;
 
 
wherein n is a number from 1 to 5;

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Use of a pharmaceutically acceptable amide or ester 
of 13-trans-retinoic acid in the manufacture of a 

medicament for the treatment of skin cancer or 
photoaging of skin. 
Use of a retinoid selected from esters and amides of 
13-trans-retinoic acid, the retinoid having the formula: 

 
wherein R represents 


 
wherein X represents -H, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -OH, -OR, 

-OR', 
 

-CN, -NO₂, -NH₂, -NHR' or -NR'₂; 
n is a number from 1 to 5; 

R' represents a hydrogen atom or C₁₋₆-alkyl; 
R'' represents 

 
-OR', 

 
or -R'; and 

R''' represents a group R' or the hydrocarbon backbone of 
a fatty acid; 

provided that, when there is more than any one group R', 
R'' and/or R''' present, each group R', R'' and/or R''' may 

be the same or different; 
for the manufacture of a medicament as defined in claim 

1, preferably for retarding and reversing the effects of 
photoaging and skin cancer without the inducement of 

dermatitis. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the retinoid 
compound comprises from about 0.01% to about 0.5% by 

weight of the medicament. 
Use according to claim 3, wherein the retinoid 
compound comprises from about 0.05% to about 0.2% by 

weight of the medicament. 
Use according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
retinoid compound is admixed with an acceptable topical 

vehicle to form the medicament. 
Use according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
vehicle is propylene glycol-ethanol and an antioxidant. 
Use according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
retinoid compound is 1-(all trans-retinoyloxy)-2-propanone. 
Use according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the 
retinoid compound is 2-(all-trans-retinoyloxy)-4'-methoxyacetophenone.
