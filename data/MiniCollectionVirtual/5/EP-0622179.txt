<ABSTRACT>
A packaging laminate (10) including a rigid, but foldable paper or 
paperboard layer (11) which has, at least on its one side, an outer film or 

coating (12) of a water-insoluble polysaccharide compound which imparts 
to the packaging laminate (10) tightness properties against liquid and water 

vapour and good sealing properties. Preferably, the other side of the core 
layer (11) also has an outer film or coating (13) of said polysaccharide 

compound. 
The polysaccharide compound in the two outer films or coatings (12 

and 13) includes, on the one hand, a first water-soluble polysaccharide of 
polyanionic character and, on the other hand, a second water-soluble 

polysaccharide of polycationic character, these being chemically or 
otherwise bonded to one another for forming the water-insoluble 

polysaccharide compound. One preferred such polysaccharide compound 
may, for example, consist of a chemical compound or a chemical complex 

of chitosan and agar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging laminate including a 
core layer, and a film or coating possessing good sealing properties and 
low water vapour permeability applied to one or both sides of the core layer. 
The present invention also relates to a method of producing the packaging 
laminate. Nowadays, packaging containers of the single-use disposable type 
are often employed for packing and transporting foods of a liquid nature, 
such as milk. The material in these so-called single-use packages is 
normally composed of a plurality of mutually laminated layers of the same 
or different materials which, in cooperation with one another, impart the 
desired mechanical and chemical properties to the package. A well-known packaging laminate which has long been employed in 
the art for this type of package consists, for example, of one or more inner 
layers of a fibre material, which gives the package the requisite mechanical 
strength and configurational stability, and outer layers of plastics which give 
the package its necessary tightness properties against liquids which could 
otherwise readily penetrate into the fibre layers of the packaging material 
and thereby weaken the mechanical strength and bond properties of the 
package. Preferably, the outer plastics layer of the packaging laminate 
consists of thermoplastic, ideally polyethylene, which is impermeable to 
liquid and moisture and which, moreover, makes the packaging laminate 
heat-sealable or fusible in such a manner that mutually facing plastics 
layers of the packaging laminate may readily be united to one another by 
surface fusion for the formation of mechanically strong, liquid-tight sealing 
joints or seams during the packaging production process. Thus, from a web of the above-described prior art packaging 
laminate, there are produced configurationally stable, liquid-tight single use 
packages employing modern, rational packaging machines which reform 
the web into a tube, in that the two longitudinal edges of the web are 
brought to overlap one another and are fused to one another in a  
 
longitudinal lap joint or seam. The tube is filled with the desired contents 
and then divided into closed, cushion-shaped packages by repeated 
transverse sealings of the tube, transversely of the longitudinal axis of the 
tube, beneath the level of the contents in the tube. The packages are 
separated from one another by incisions in the transverse sealing zones 
and are given the desired geometric, normally parallelepipedic, final form 
by

that the first polysaccharide (A) consists of at least partly deacetylated 

chitosan. 
The packaging laminate as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in 
that said chitosan has a degree of deacetylation of at least 10%. 
The packaging laminate as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the second polysaccharide (B) is selected 

from among agar, alginate, pectin, karrageenan, starch, cellulose and

one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that one or both sides of a 

continuous web are coated with an aqueous solution containing a first 
polysaccharide (A), and a second polysaccharide (B); and that the web is 

thereafter dried for driving off water, for the formation of the water-insoluble 
polysaccharide coating.

continuous web are laminated with a prefabricated film of a polysaccharide 
compound which includes a first water-soluble polysaccharide (A), and a 

second water-soluble poysaccharide (B), but which in itself is insoluble in 
water. 
The method as claimed in Claim 10, characterized in that the 
first polysaccharide (A) consists of at least partly deacetylated chitosan. 
The method as claimed in Claim 10 or 11, characterized in
