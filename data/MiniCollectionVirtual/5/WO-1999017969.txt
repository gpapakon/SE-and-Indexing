<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronically controllable brake booster (21) comprising a control valve assembly which, according to a current (I), occupies a stopping position (II) in which the current lies in a region between a higher value (IBUILD-UP) and a lower value (IREDUCTION) such that the control valve assembly does not abandon the stopping position (II). Said control valve assembly also occupies a first pressure change position (I) in which the current (I) is greater than the higher value (IBUILD-UP), and a second pressure change position (III) in which the current (I) is less than the lower value (IREDUCTION). The duration (T0,A) required for the transition is determined during a transition of the control valve assembly from the stopping position (II) to the first (I) or the second (III) pressure change position or during a transition of said assembly from the first (I) or the second (III) pressure change position to the stopping position (II). Said determined duration (T0,A) is compared with a predetermined period of time (Tmin) in order to determine whether the transition occurs within said predetermined period of time (Tmin). The higher (IBUILD-UP, NEW) and/or lower (IREDUCTION, NEW) current value which defines the stopping position (II) is changed for future transitions if the determined duration (T0,A) exceeds the predetermined period of time (Tmin).
