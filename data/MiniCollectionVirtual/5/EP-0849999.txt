<ABSTRACT>
the invention discloses a composite fabric (1), comprising a carrier grid arranged between a fabric (2) and a flexible sheet (4), mutually linked, the carrier grid (3), at least bi-directional, assembling at least weft and warp threads (31, 32, 33, 34), mutually linked, the meshwork (35) defined by the grid (3) having a surface opening larger than the interstices (23) defined by the texture of the decorative fabric (2), the decorative fabric (2) being directly linked to the flexible sheet (4), through the meshwork (35) of the carrier grid (3), such that the fabric has external ribs resulting from the size of the warp threads (31, 32).

Composite fabric consisting of three
superimposed layers comprising an outer layer (2) made of

a decorative cloth, a flexible outer layer (4) and a
central layer (3), 
characterized in that
 the central
layer is formed by a carrying grid (3), at least bidirectional,

made of crossed threads connected together
(31, 32) of a high toughness, the diameter of which is

greater than the thickness of the woven outer layer (2)
so that the fabric comprises, on the side thereof,

protruding ribs (5), the decorative cloth (2) being
directly bound to the flexible inner layer (4), through

meshes of the grid (3), and 
in that
 the decorative cloth
(2) is an abrasion resistant cloth, the inner layer (4)

being an impervious layer.
Composite fabric according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 at least some of the weft threads
(31, 32) of the grid (3) are obliquely oriented to the

threads (21, 22) of the cloth of the outer layer (2) and
form polygonal meshes (35), the threads being connected

together.
Composite fabric according to claim 2,

characterized in that
 the warp threads (33, 34) are of
polyester, the weft wires (31, 23) being of aramide.
Composite fabric according to claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that
 the diameter of the three weft
threads (31, 32) is at least three times greater than the

diameter of the warp threads (33, 34). 
Composite fabric according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the outer decorative cloth (2) has
a warp (21) and weft (22) structure of abrasion-resistant

threads such as polyester threads.
Composite fabric according to claims 3 and 5,

characterized in that
 the weft threads (31, 32) of the
grid (3) are inclined with respect to the warp (21)

and/or weft (22) threads of the outer cloth (2).
Composite fabric according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the diameter of the threads of the
grid (31, 32) is at least five times greater than the

diameter of the threads (21, 22) of the outer decorative
cloth (2).
Composite fabric according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the inner layer
(4) is connected to the outer layer (2) by gluing,

coating or calendering through the meshes of the grid
(3).
Hand luggage made of a composite fabric
according to any one of claims 1 to 8.
Garment made of a composite fabric according to
any one of claims 1 to 8.
