<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus disclosed herein employs a grating or scale (13) which concentrates light at a preselected wavelength into the positive (33) and negative (35) first orders while minimizing the zeroth order (31). The scale (13) is illuminated with monochromatic light of the selected wavelength and a poly-phase periodic detector (25) has its sensing plane spaced from the scale a distance less than W: 2 tan THETA  where  THETA  = arcsin [ lambda : P], where W is the width of the illuminated region of the scale. The period of the poly-phase detector is equal to P/2 so that each detector element (51) or phase responds principally to interference between the positive and negative first orders without requiring magnification or redirection of the diffracted light. Preferably, the distance of the sensing plane from the scale (13) is greater than W: 2 tan  phi  where  phi = arcsin [3 lambda : P]
, so that the detector response does not include substantial components from diffraction orders higher than the first.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
instrument for measuring displacement and more
particularly to such an instrument which utilizes
diffraction of monochromatic light from a scale or
grating which is movable relative to a light source
or sensing head.A number of systems have been proposed
heretofore for measuring relative displacement
utilizing diffraction of light from an optical
grating. Examples of such prior art systems may be
seen in the Pettigrew patent 4,776,701; the Kanayama
et al. patent 4,815,850; and the Taniguchi et al.
patent 4,676,645. A commercially available system of
this type is sold by Optra, Inc. of Beverly, MA under
its trademark "Nanoscale". Each of these prior art
systems, however, involves magnification or
separation of the different diffraction orders
obtained back from the diffraction grating which are
then brought back together and interfered.
Typically, fairly large numbers of optical components
are required and the several components must be
accurately spaced and aligned in order for the
instruments to perform in accordance with their
respective designs.Among the several objects of the present
invention may be noted the provision of an apparatus for
detecting relative displacement which employs a
minimum of components; the provision of such a system
in which tolerance of spacing and alignment of system
components is relatively great; the provision of such
an apparatus which is easily manufactured; the
provision of such an apparatus in which sensing
components can be implemented using integrated 
circuit techniques; the provision of such an apparatus
which can provide measurement with high accuracy; the
provision of such an apparatus which is highly reliable
and which is of relatively simple and inexpensive
construction. Other objects and features are in part
apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.The apparatus of the present invention utilizes a scale or
grating (hereafter collectively referred to as "scale")
which, for a preselected wavelength, concentrates
diffracted light into the positive and negative first
orders. The scale is relatively movable with respect to a
source of light providing monochromatic light of the
selected wavelength and which illuminates a region of the
scale having a width W along the length of the scale. A
periodic detector is spaced close to the scale so that each
detector phase or element responds principally to
interference between the positive and negative first
orders diffracted from the scale without intermediate
reflection or
