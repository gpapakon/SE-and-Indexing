 DUAL WAVELENGTH PUMPED WAVEGUIDE AMPLIFIERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to optical amplifiers. More particularly, the invention relates to an optical amplifier employing dual wavelength pumping to reduce the steady state population in the intermediate termination energy level by repopulating the metastable energy level. The power and/or wavelength of the second pump may be adjusted to alter the shape of the amplifier gain spectrum.2. Technical BackgroundOptical amplifiers increase the amplitude of an optical wave through a process known as stimulated emission in which a photon, supplied as the input signal, induces higher energy level electrons within an optical material to undergo a transition to a lower energy level. In the process, the material emits a photon with the same frequency, direction and polarization as the initial photon. These two photons can, in turn, serve to stimulate the emission of two additional photons, and so forth. The result is coherent light amplification. Stimulated emission occurs when the photon energy is nearly equal to the atomic transition energy difference. For this reason, the process produces amplification in one or more bands of frequencies determined by the atomic line width. 

 While there are a number of different optical amplifier configurations in use today, the optical fiber configuration is quite popular, particularly for optical communications applications. The optical fiber amplifier typically consists of an optical material such as glass, combined with a rare earth dopant and configured as an optical waveguide. Rare-earth-doped silica fibers are popular today, in part because they offer the advantages of single-mode guided wave optics. Optical fiber amplifiers can be made to operate over a broad range of wavelengths, dictated by the atomic properties of the host and rare earth dopant. The phenomenal growth in communication technology and information technology has fueled considerable interest in finding new optical fiber materials that will increase signal channel bandwidth and allow engineers to exploit new frequency bands.One difficulty encountered in the rare-earth materials has to do with the materials' inherent low multi-phonon decay rates. It is desirable to have a long lifetime in the metastable energy level because it aids stimulated emission.However, it can be undesirable if the particular material exhibits a similarly long lifetime in an intermediate termination energy level.By way of
