<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to internal junction organic electroluminescent 
devices. More specifically, the invention relates to organic electroluminescent 
devices of the type in which an organic medium contains an internal junction 
formed at the interface of an electron injecting and transporting zone in contact 
with a cathode and a hole injecting and transporting zone in contact with an 
anode. Electroluminescent devices (hereinafter also referred to as EL devices) 
contain spaced electrodes separated by an electroluminescent medium that 
emits light in response to the application of an electrical potential difference 
across the electrodes. Through intensive investigations and a series of recent 
inventions organic electroluminescent devices of improved characteristics, both 
in terms of fabrication feasibility and operating performance, have been 
developed. In current preferred forms, organic EL devices are comprised of an 
anode, an organic hole injecting and transporting zone in contact with the 
anode, an electron injecting and transporting zone forming a junction with the 
organic hole injecting and transporting zone, and a cathode in contact with the 
electron injecting and transporting zone. When an electrical potential is placed 
across the electrodes, holes and electrons are injected into the organic zones 
from the anode and cathode, respectively. Light emission results from hole-electron 
recombination within the device. A class of organic EL devices that have exhibited highly desirable levels 
of efficiency and stability are those that have employed a metal oxinoid charge 
accepting compound to form the electron injecting and transporting zone of the 
organic EL device. The following patents and publications disclose the 
preparation and utilization of metal oxinoid compounds:  R-1. VanSlyke et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,539,507, discloses in column 
9, lines 14 to 16 inclusive, metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline, where the 
metal is Zn, Al, Mg, or Li. In Example 9 the metal complex is bis(8-hydroxy-quinolino)aluminum 
and in Example 10, bis(8-hydroxyquinolino)magnesium. R-2. Tang et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,769,292, discloses constructing an 
organic EL device in which the luminescent layer is comprised of a charge 
accepting host material and a fluorescent material. The host material can be 
chosen from among diarylbutadienes, stilbenes, optical brighteners, and metal 
oxinoid compounds, with the following being listed among preferred 
embodiments: aluminum trisoxine, magnesium bisoxine,
