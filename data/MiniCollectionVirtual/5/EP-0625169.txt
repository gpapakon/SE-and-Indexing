<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF STYRENIC FOAMField Of The Invention This invention relates generally to a method for the production of an insulating styrenic foam, and more particularly to such a method which does not use ethylchloride as a blowing agent.Bac ground Of The Invention Thermoplastic foams made from styrenic polymers, such as polystyrene, have found extensive use, particularly as insulating materials. Generally, insulating styrenic foams are produced in thicknesses greater than about one- half inch. The insulating value of such foams is measured in terms of heat conduction resistance or R-vaiue, per one inch of foam thickness, and adequate insulating foams typically have R-values of about 5.0 per inch or greater. Styrenic insulating foams to meet government construction standards generally must also be dimensionally stable, i.e., they must have a maximum change in any of length, width or thickness of less than about 2.0 percent when subjected to a 158°F temperature for 24 hours.These styrenic foams typically are made by mixing a volatile blowing agent with the styrenic resin under a controlled temperature and pressure sufficient to liquefy and plasticize the resin and to maintain the resin in an unfoamed state, and then extruding the resin-blowing agent mixture through a die into a zone of lower temperature and pressure which results in the formation of the styrenic foam. Blowing agent compositions for styrenic foam production generally are required first to have a system vapor pressure at the melt temperature of the styrenic resin sufficient to produce acceptable insulating foam, and second to provide sufficient plasticization to the styrenic resin to permit extrusion at suitable production rates. The blowing agent should also not have too great of a plasticizing effect on the styrenic resin, to avoid dimensional instability of the foam.Dimensionally stable, insulating styrenic foams which retain an R-value above 5.0 per inch upon aging, are being produced commercially with blowing agents based on 1-chloro-1 ,1-difiuoroethane (also known as "FC-142b", which will be used . for convenience hereafter). FC-142b-based blowing agents eliminate the use of the chlorofluorocarbons, such as Freon 12, which are suspected of reacting with ozone after their release into the earth's atmosphere. 

 These hydrofluorocarbon blowing agents of reduced or zero ozone reactivity potential have sufficient plasticizing effect when used in conjunction with ethylchloride to achieve suitable production rates of insulating
