<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for feeding
microwaves to a microwave heating device, and to a
microwave heating device comprising a microwave source for
generating microwaves, a cavity in which a load is placed
during a heating procedure and means for feeding
microwaves into the cavity via feed points.There currently exist various models of microwave
heating devices (for example microwave ovens) where the
microwaves, which are generated by a microwave source or
magnetron, are supplied in various ways to the cavity of
the microwave heating device via one or more feed points.US 4,336,434, for example, discloses such a microwave
oven. The oven is provided with a waveguide lying outside
the cavity and two feed points. Additionally, a stirrer or
antenna is disposed within the waveguide. When the
microwaves are supplied to the cavity, a microwave field
is formed having energy maxima and minima (also known as
peaks and nodes) at certain positions. This phenonomen is
well known in the technical field and results in the load
(for example a food item which is to be cooked) receiving
an uneven heating result. However, by disposing the
stirrer in the waveguide, the positions of these peaks and
nodes can be shifted during the heating procedure. The
principle of operation is that the stirrer is set into
rotation, for example by letting an airflow pass through
the waveguide or with an electric motor, which results in
a more even microwave field being produced in the cavity.
The above patent is silent as to how the stirrer should be
driven aside from that it is accomplished with an
airflow or an electric motor.Other examples of prior art ovens, aside from those
referred to in US 4,336,434, include i.e. DE 3 029 035,
FR 1 378 280 and US 4,140,888.US 5, 015, 813 discloses a microwave oven with a
certain specific position of the microwave oscillating
antenne with respect to the ends of the waveguideThe prior art ovens are constructed to give the most 
even microwave field possible in the cavity, i.e. an even
power distribution. However, such a distribution does not
provide the desired even heat distribution in a load
which requires an uneven power distribution to become
uniformly warm, e.g. a spread out, non-homogeneous load.The object of the present invention is to provide a
method for feeding microwave energy into a cavity, and a
microwave heating device for use therefor, which do not
exhibit the abovementioned limitations and which enable
control of the microwave field depending on the load which
is to be
