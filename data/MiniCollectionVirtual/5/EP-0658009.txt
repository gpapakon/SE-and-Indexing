<ABSTRACT>
A remote control device including a receiver (7) for 
receiving a control signal which remotely controls an 

external device, a RAM (5) for storing the received control 
signal in correspondence to a respective one of keys (3), a 

transmitter (6) for reading a control signal corresponding 
to an operated key (3) from the RAM (5) and transmitting 

the read control signal, and a display (11) for displaying 
the stored data in the RAM (5) when the control signal is 

received/transmitted. In a first aspect, when an external 
control signal is received and stored for any key (3), a 

key for which no control signal is stored is detected from 
the RAM (5) and displayed on the display (11). When a 

control signal is transmitted, a key for which a control 
signal is stored in the RAM (5) is detected and displayed 

on the display (11). In a second aspect, when an external 
control signal is received, a detector detects the contents 

of the received control signal, which are then displayed on 
the display. By such arrangement, when a control signal is 

transmitted/received, the user can easily know a key to be 
operated and whether the external control signal has been 

received correctly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a remote control device as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.
A device of this kind is known from EP-A-0 566 516.The aforementioned document discloses a multimodal hand-held mode control device usable
for selecting designated functions in a plurality of multimedia processing units. An electrically
alterable graphic designation is provided in association with each user selectable keypad, the
function thereof being visually displayed. Selected menus and textural help messages may be
loaded into the remote control device.US-A-4 825 200 discloses a reconfigurable remote control device, which can be used with a
plurality of remotely controlled products, each of which is normally controlled with one or more
signals from an associated or "pure" remote control transmitter. The reconfigurable remote
control device has a plurality of input keys, and operates either in a teaming mode in which it
may store indications of signals generated by remote control "pure" transmitter, or a control
mode in which it selectively transmits stored signals in response to one or more keyed input.
The device comprises indication means for indicating that the signal being received in the
teaming mode is of proper strength to permit an indication thereof to be correctly stored. The
keys are each individually and fixedly labelled so as to provide information on the dedicated
function to be controlled by operation by the respective key.From GB-A-2, 238,146, a remote controller having the design of an electronic wrist watch is
known. The operation of an LCD display may be switched from a normal time piece display to
a control instruction display. The remote controller does not have means to enable the device
to be switched into a learning mode in which it receives control signals from an external control
signal transmitter. The remote control devices annexed originally to
specified electronic devices (hereinafter referred to as
"pure" remote control devices) manufactured by any
particular manufacturer are not usable with electronic devices of
different kinds and manufacturers or with different kinds of
electronic devices. The number of different remote control
devices would increase in direct proportion to the number
of different kinds of electronic devices and the number of
different manufacturers.Recently, learning remote control devices have been
proposed as ones adaptable to electronic devices of
different kinds and/or manufacturers, see US-A-4 825 200, above.The learning remote control device is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A remote control device (1) including:

a plural keys (3a);
memory means (5) having plural memory locations assigned to the plural keys (3a),
and for storing at least a remote control signal sent from at least one accessory

remote controller used for remotely controlling at least one external device; and
mode setting means (3j, 3k) for selectively setting one of a learning mode to store
in the memory means (5) the at least one remote control signal, and a controlling

mode for reading-out to send the at least one remote control signal stored in the
memory means used to remotely control the at least one external device; and
display means (11);
characterized in that

the display means (11) being caused to display an indication of those keys for
which remote control signals are not stored in the memory locations when the

learning mode is set by the mode setting means, and caused to display an
indication of those keys for which remote control signals are stored in the memory

locations when the controlling mode is set by the mode setting means.
The remote control device according to claim 1. wherein the display means (11)
further displays the kind of the remote control signal.
The remote control device according to claim 1, wherein the remote control device
has a shape which is suitable for being attached to a wrist.
