<ABSTRACT>
A radar apparatus that is provided with auxiliary antennas 
(5, 10) of an omnidirectional nature. In addition to 

customary ECCM applications, such as side-lobe suppression 
and side-lobe blanking, the auxiliary antennas (5, 10) are 

also used for the emission of frequency-shifted pulses 
which are emitted simultaneously with radar transmitter 

pulses. To this effect, the radar apparatus is provided 
with auxiliary transmitters (8, 13). Furthermore, auxiliary 

receivers (6, 11) have been provided for analyzing the 
responses of jammers to the frequency-shifted pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radar apparatus comprising at
least one directional main antenna, steering means for
generating radar transmitter steering pulses to be supplied
to the main antenna via transmitter means and for
generating auxiliary transmitter steering pulses to be
supplied to at least one auxiliary antenna via at least one
auxiliary receiver, and receiver means connected to the
main antenna.A radar apparatus of this kind is known from US-A-4,435,710.
The known radar apparatus uses the auxiliary
antenna for transmitting auxiliary transmitter pulses
during and inbetween transmitter pulses for confuzing
jammers. The auxiliary transmitter steering pulses that are
transmitted inbetween transmitter pulses are given an RF
frequency that differs from the transmitter pulses in order
to enable the reception of radar echoes during the
transmission of auxiliary transmitter pulses.A disadvantage of this known radar apparatus is that in
modern radars the dynamic range is so huge that the
transmission of auxiliary transmitter pulses prevents the
radar from functioning properly. Especially small, stealthy
targets will be completely eclipsed by auxiliary
transmitter pulses, whatever the RF frequency difference
may be.Moreover modern radars are preferably equipped with passive
ECCM features like side-lobe blanking units, known for
example from EP-B 0.173.360 or sidelobe cancellers, known
for example from EP-A 0.076.536, which also utilize
auxiliary antennas. These passive EECM features are not
compatible with the known active ECCM features. The radar apparatus according to the invention has the
active ECCM features known from US-A 4,435,710 without the
disadvantage of eclipsing the reception of echoes of small
targets. Moreover the auxiliary antennas are available
between radar transmitter pulses and may be used for
passive ECCM features. It is characterized in that at least
one auxiliary receiver is provided, connected to the at
least one auxiliary antenna, the output of the at least one
auxiliary receiver being connected to the receiver means
for reducing the effect of jammers on the receiver means
and that the steering means are designed for generating the
auxiliary transmitter steering pulses substantially
simultaneously with the radar transmitter steering pulses,
the auxiliary transmitter steering pulses deviating from
radar transmitter steering pulses.The radar apparatus according to invention proves to be
most effective against the more intelligent repeater
jammers, particularly if these receive the
