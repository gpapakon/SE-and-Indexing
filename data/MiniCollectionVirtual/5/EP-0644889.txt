<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods are provided for the modulation of expression of the gene encoding  beta -amyloid in both the normal and mutant forms. Oligonucleotides are provided which are specifically hybridizable with RNA or DNA deriving from the  beta -amyloid precursor ( beta APP) gene encoding  beta -amyloid, having nucleotide units sufficient in identity and number to effect such specific hybridization. Oligonucleotides specifically hybridizable with a translation initiation site or with the codon-717 mutation of  beta APP are provided. Such oligonucleotides can be used for diagnostics as well as for research purposes. Methods are also disclosed for modulating  beta -amyloid expression in cells and tissues using the oligonucleotides provided, and for specific modulation of expression of the mutant  beta APP gene. Methods for diagnosis, detection and treatment of conditions arising from the mutation of the  beta APP gene are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
(*COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR MODULATING B-AMYLOIDFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the design and synthesis of antisense oligonucleotides which can be administered to 5 modulate the production of β-amyloid protein. These compounds can be used either prophylactically or therapeutically to reduce the severity of disease caused by the abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid. Oligonucleotides which are specifically hybridizable with RNA targets are 10 described.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia during aging in many developed countries. Gradual loss of memory, emotional stability and judgment usually15 leads to a slow death between four and twelve years after onset. Patients need constant supervision and eventually total custodial care due to the severely debilitated state which results. The cost of diagnosing and managing Alzheimer's patients is currently estimated at more than $8020 billion dollars a year in the US alone. [Selkoe, D.J. (1991) Scientific American 265:68-78.]Two types of brain lesions, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, were described by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in patients with dementia. The senile plaques25 occur in huge numbers in the areas of the brain responsible for cognitive function, particularly the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. These spherical plaques consist of altered neurites (axons and dendrites) , which are the long 

 tapering portions of neurons, surrounding an extracellular mass of filaments. It is presently believed that neurons are caused to degenerate as a result of entanglement in this filament matrix. No treatment is known which either prevents or retards the progression of the disease.OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide oligonucleotides which are capable of hybridizing with messenger RNA of β-amyloid to modulate the function of the messenger RNA.It is a further object to provide oligonucleotides which can modulate the expression of β-amyloid through antisense interaction with messenger RNA.Yet another object of this invention is to provide methods of diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases associated with β-amyloid overaccumulation.Methods, materials and kits for detecting the presence or absence of β-amyloid messenger RNA in a sample suspected of containing it are further objects of the invention.Novel oligonucleotides are other objects of the invention.Another object of the invention is to provide oligonucleotides which are capable of hybridizing
