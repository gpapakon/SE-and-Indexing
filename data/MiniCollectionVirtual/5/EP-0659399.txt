<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the direct dyeing (or tinting) of keratinous fibres, which consists in bringing keratinous fibres, to which a composition containing at least one direct dye chosen from 2-nitro-para-phenylenediamine derivatives and/or nitro derivatives of particular aminophenols has been applied, into contact with a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of the aforementioned gas being above 75 DEG C and the contact time between the aforementioned gas and the aforementioned fibres to be dyed being less than two minutes. According to the invention, the hair is dyed uniformly over the whole of the head from the roots to the ends, irrespectively of the state of the individual hairs.
