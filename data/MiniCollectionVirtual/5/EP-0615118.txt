<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure 
sensor utilizing the magnetostriction effect of an 
amorphous magnetic alloy. A pressure sensor utilizing the magnetostriction 
effect of an amorphous magnetic alloy (which was 
invented by a group including one of the inventors of 
the present invention) disclosed in the United States 
Patent No. 4,938,069. Referring to Figure 8, such a conventional 
pressure sensor will be described. Figure 8 is a cross 
sectional view of a pressure sensor 55. The pressure sensor 55 includes a cylindrical 
main body 41. The main body 41 includes a pressure 
chamber 43 for conveying a pressure and a hollow section 
46. The pressure chamber 43 and the hollow section 
46 have an identical diameter with each other. A 
part of the main body 41 enclosing the pressure chamber 
43 is a deformable section 44 which is deformable when 
being supplied with a pressure. A part of the main 
body 41 enclosing the hollow section 46 is a non-deformable 
section 45 which is not deformable when being 
supplied with a pressure. The main body 41 has a 
pressure inlet 42 an at end thereof, and an outer 
peripheral surface of the pressure inlet 42 is provided 
with a screw thread 52 for securing the main body 41 
to, for example, a container (not shown), the inner  
 
pressure of which is to be detected. The pressure 
chamber 43 is in fluid communication with the inside of 
the container. An amorphous magnetic alloy member 47 is 
adhered on a part of the outer peripheral surface of 
the main body 41 to cover both of the deformable section 
44 and the non-deformable section 45. The amorphous 
magnetic alloy member 47 is adhered by an adhesive 
agent including an imide material. When the 
volume of the deformable section 44 changes in accordance 
with a change in the inner pressure of the pressure 
chamber 43, the permeability of the amorphous 
magnetic alloy member 47 also changes. The main body 41 provided with the amorphous 
magnetic alloy member 47 is enclosed by a bobbin 50. A 
pressure detection coil 48 formed of a wire winding and 
a dummy coil 49 are provided at the outer peripheral 
surface of the bobbin 50. The pressure detection coil 
48 is located at a position corresponding to the deformable 
section 44, and the dummy coil 49 is located 
at a position corresponding to the non-deformable 
section 45. The pressure detection coil 48 and the 
dummy coil 49 are both connected to a detection unit 
53. The detection unit 53 detects a change in the 
inductance of the detection coil 48 using the
