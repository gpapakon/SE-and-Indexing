<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for introducing a drug into a patient 
comprises a timer switch mechanism (2) for sequentially 

switching an applied voltage from a DC power source 1 
back and forth between two or more electrode pairs 

(3,4;5,6) attached to the patient's skin (9). One 
electrode (3,5) of each pair contains the drug, the drug 

passing into the patient on the application of a voltage 
across the electrode pair. The voltage is cut off from 

one pair before the establishment of a polarisation 
effect between the electrodes of that pair (which would 

normally inhibit transmission of the drug), whilst at 
the same time ensuring continuous drug deliver by 

applying the voltage to another pair. 
The drug delivery rate is increased, whilst 
inhibiting skin damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical drug 
introducing apparatus, and, more particularly, to 
electrical drug introducing apparatus able to introduce 
a drug through the skin highly efficiently, whilst 
preventing skin damage. The invention may act as a drug 
delivery system. Electrical drug introducing apparatus is now 
attracting general attention as a non-invasive drug 
administration method, and various studies are being 
conducted into it. In this method, however, application 
of a DC voltage to the skin causes polarization due to 
the chemical constituents of the skin, and, in this 
state, almost no drug delivery current flows. To solve this problem, apparatus having a 
depolarization function has been proposed. For example, 
the use of a switch for short-circuiting both the 
electrodes, or a mechanism for applying reverse-polarity 
pulses between both electrodes, during a downtime of 
drug administration, is discosed in Japanese Patent 
Provisional Publication No 60-156,475. Japanese Patent 
Provisional Publication No. 64-11,565 discloses a method 
of reducing the electrical resistance of skin by 
applying a voltage of 5 to 20 V for 1 to 60 seconds by 
means of a constant voltage device, and of then applying 
a voltage of 0 to 5 V, thereby increasing the drug 
absorption rate. Japanese Patent Provisional 
Publication No. 3-45,272 covers a method of suppressing 
polarization by applying an AC voltage of a prescribed 
frequency between the electrodes In spite of the improvements described above, a 
problem still exists in that the drug is not introduced 
at all to the patient during depolarization, because 
depolarization is effected during stoppage of drug  
 
delivery. Therefore, the drug delivery rate is limited, 
and the conventional apparatus is not suitable for 
administration of a drug in situations where an 
immediate effect is required. Further, when using a 
high voltage, the occurrence of skin disease is 
dramatically increased, even with a high-frequency 
pulse. The present invention aims to provide electrical 
drug introducing apparatus which solves the above-mentioned 
problems, permits an increase in the drug 
introduction rate and inhibits skin impairment. With a view to solving the above-mentioned 
problems, the present invention provides an electrical 
drug introducing apparatus in which a drug is caused to 
penetrate into a patient's body by applying a voltage 
between an electrode pair, at least one electrode of 
which contains the drug, the apparatus being provided 
with
