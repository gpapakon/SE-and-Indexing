Hand-scrubbing brush comprising a mains-independent 
motor drive enclosed within a watertight housing in which 

an operating switch is integrated, and further comprising 
at least one rotational body equipped with bristles, 


characterized
 in that said housing (1) consists of a 
kidney-shaped handling or grip sleeve (20) which, as 

regards its design, is adapted to the natural arching of the 
palm of the human hand, as well as of a likewise kidney-shaped 

bearing plate (2) for closing said grip sleeve (20) 
on its end face, that in said bearing plate (2) there is provided 

a plurality of rotational bodies rotatably disposed along 
an arcuate or curved line adapted to said kidney shape, and 

that a gear mechanism is provided for with the aid of which 
said rotational bodies are capable of being driven by a 

motor either form- or force-lockingly. 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that both a gear mechanism and said motor drive (motor 9 

with reduction gear 10) are flanged to the inner side of said 
bearing plate (2) as facing said handling or grip sleeve (20), 

and that both said bearing plate (2) and said grip sleeve (20) 
are detachably connected with one another in a watertight manner.  

 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said rotational bodies are 
capable of being plugged into position. 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the bearing bushes (7) of said 
rotational bodies are distributed in said bearing plate (2) 

along two circular-arc lines (K1, K2), with the radius (r2) 
of the one circular arc (K2) referring to the outer ones of 

said bearing bushes (7) being smaller than the radius (r1) of 
the other circular arc (K1) referring to the inner ones of said 

bearing bushes (7). 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 2, 

characterized
 in that said gear mechanism is so designed 
that all of said rotational bodies rotate in the same direction, 

and that the direction of rotation of said motor (9) is 
reversible. 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said rotational bodies are equipped 
with clusters of bristles (31), and that the clusters of bristles 

(31) of neighbouring brush rollers (30) are staggered and so 
positioned as to fill gaps. 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said rotational bodies are toothed 
or sprocket rollers embraced by a gear belt which, on its outer 

side, is provided with bristles, and is of the endless type.  
 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said operational switch is a 
solenoid-operated switch (13 / 22) whose switching magnet, 

in the form of a sliding contact (22), is disposed in a water-tight 
manner within said grip sleeve (20). 
A hand-scrubbing brush as defined in any one of the preceding 
Claims, 
characterized
 in that there is provided a splashproof 
enclosure (40) which is capable of being slipped or 

plugged onto said grip sleeve (20).
