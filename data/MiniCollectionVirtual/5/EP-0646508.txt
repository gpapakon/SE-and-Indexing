<ABSTRACT>
A motor trouble detection device detects a trouble 
of the motor (30) used in an anti skid brake control system 

for returning the brake fluid to the reservoir tank (65) 
by based on the counter electromotive force (Vi) of the motor 

(30) which is turned off after driving a predetermined period 
(T1 and (T2-T1)/9) at two steps (S9 and S23). The motor (30) 

is regarded as troubled temporarily, even when it is judged 
that the counter electromotive force (Vi) is smaller than a 

predetermined voltage (V0) at a first step when the vehicle 
starts. Only when the motor (30) is regarded as troubled at 

the second step, it is detected that the motor (30) is in 
trouble. Thus, the motor trouble is detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor trouble 
detection device according to the preamble of claim 1. A 
device of this kind is known from DE-A-3 819 490. As shown in Fig. 8, an anti skid brake control 
system (ABS) of a fluid circulation type includes an 
electronic control unit 51 which performs various computations 
and judgements based on the signals from wheel speed sensors 
S1, S2, S3, and S4 each respectively provided to wheels. The 
ABS further produces control signals for pressure control 
valves of its hydraulic system to control brake fluid pressure 
properly. The electronic controller 51 is comprised of a wheel 
speed detector 52, a reference speed calculator 53, an anti 
skid controller 58, a solenoid driver 59, and a motor driver 
60. The wheel speed detector 52 calculates actual wheel speed 
of each wheel based on the signals from each of sensors S1, 
S2, S3, and S4. The reference speed calculator 53 produces 
a reference speed signal based on the calculated actual wheel 
speeds.  
 The anti skid controller 58 judges that a wheel is 
locked when the reference speed signal is greater than the 
actual wheel speed(s) by a predetermined value, and gives a 
solenoid driver 59 a pressure reduction instruction to 
energize solenoids SOL1 and SOL2. A solenoid valve 62, which 
is normally opened, closes a brake fluid supply path extending 
from a fluid pressure source constructed by a master cylinder 
61 and an accumulator 66. A solenoid valve 63, which is 
normally closed, closes a fluid discharge path. As a result, 
a brake fluid in a brake cylinder 64 flows into a reservoir 
tank 65, and the brake fluid pressure in the brake cylinder 
64 reduces. As the brake fluid pressure reduction starts, the 
motor driver 60 makes a motor 30 to start so that a pump 31 
sucks the brake fluid in the wheel cylinder 64 and returns the 
sucked brake fluid to the fluid supply side. However, when 
the wheel speed indicative of a locking symptom is improved 
by the fluid pressure reduction, the difference between the 
reference speed and the actual wheel speed(s) becomes smaller 
than the predetermined value. In this case, the anti skid 
controller 58 judges that the wheel(s) is released from the 
locked state, and gives the solenoid driver 59 a pressure 
increasing instruction to release the solenoids SOL1 and SOL2. 
As a result, the solenoid valves 62 and 63 return to the  
 
normal condition, as depicted in Fig. 8, and are ready for 
increasing the brake pressure. According to the anti skid control brake
