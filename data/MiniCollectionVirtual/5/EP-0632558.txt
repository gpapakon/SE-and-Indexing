<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an automatic resetting
protection device to counter short circuits in
the on board electrical system of motor vehicles.The on board electrical system of modern
motor vehicles has reached levels of complexity
and magnitude which were unthinkable just a few
years ago, this is due to the increasing use of
not only the electronic control of chassis motors
(ABS, ARS, power steering, 4WD), but also to the
adoption of various servo-actuators such as
electric seats, electric side mirrors, power
windows, door locks, air-conditioning etc..It can be said that there is no part of the
bodywork, of the finishing or of the frame which
remains untouched by cables, connections or
electric actuators.This extensive use of the wiring harness, its
placement in metal boxes and its passage through
holes in the sheet metal give rise to problems of
accidental short-circuits which could seriously
damage the motor vehicle or worse.If we exclude short circuits which occur on
user equipments, which are usually protected by
individual fuses or fuses which are common to 
more then one piece of equipment, there are two
types of trigger situations for short-circuits in
the on board electrical system.The first type of short circuits, normally
intermittent, might be caused by the pinching of
the cables against the sheet metal or by the
rubbing of the insulating material against metal
edges as a result of vibrations, atmospheric
conditions or likewise which might occur during
the whole life of the motor vehicle.The second type of short-circuits might be
caused by a collision which deforms the vehicle's
chassis and bodywork and so pinches the tension
cables between metal areas.At this point it is worthwhile referring to
a general diagram of the vehicle electrical
system in order to clarify the terms of the
invention.In figure 1 a basic diagram of a typical car
system is shown.An alternator 11, a battery 12, an electric
starter 13 are shown.The alternator 11 and the battery 12 are
connected by means of a cable 14, indicated
by A - B, through which the current from the 
alternator runs, i.e. the maximum current equal
to that of the alternator.The length B - C is a large diameter cable 15
through which the current for the starter 13
runs, equal to a few hundred amperes -Through the cable 16, shown by the length B -
D, from the battery to the branch point D, all
the current absorbed by the unit 17 passes.Lengths D - 1, D - 2, ......, D - N are
lengths from the branch point D to the
corresponding protection fuses shown

An automatic resetting protection device (21) to
counter short circuits in the on-board electrical system

of motor vehicles, which is inserted between a positive
pole (B) of the battery (22) of vehicles and a branch point

(B'') of said on-board electrical system, said on-board
electrical system comprising an electrical contact of an

ignition key (Ch) of the vehicle and a plurality of
protection fuses (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, FN), said

protection device (21) also comprising:

a shunt (Sh) for sensing short circuits, which might
arise in any section of the cables of said on-board

electrical system;
voltage dividers (R1, R2, R3, R4, C1, C2,) and
corresponding voltage filters at the ends of said

shunt (Sh);

by a resistor (R0) in series to at least one current

temperature coefficient of resistivity, and means (D2,C4,R9,TR2) are provided for de-energizing the relay (X) when said
electrical contact of the ign
ition key (Ch) is in the OFF position, so that, if the
contact (X') is open, either because of a short circuit

ignition key (Ch) has been disconnected,

the current that flows through the on-board
electrical system does not exceed a first pre-determined

A protection device (21) according to claim 1,
characterised in that, in case a part of said on-board

electrical system or at least one of said protection
fuses (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, FN) short circuits, due to a

value of current lower than the value of current
necessary for the intervention of the corresponding

fuse, the disengageament of the ignition key (Ch) causes
said protection device (21) to limit the short circuit

to a value less than 1 Ampere.
