<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for preparing substituted benzyl bromides of general formula (I), wherein at least one substituent R
<
1-5
>
 represents an electroattractive group, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, C1-C4 alkoxycarbonyl, cyano or nitro, and the remaining R
<
1-5
>
 substituents represent hydrogen or methyl, by bromination of substituted toluenes of general formula (II) with a bromination agent at temperatures from 20 to 95  DEG C.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing substituted benzyl
bromides of the formula I



where at least one substituent R
1-5
 is an electron-attracting
group such as fluorine, chlorine,

bromine, C
1
-C
4
-alkoxycarbonyl, cyano or nitro, and
the other substituents R
1-5
 are hydrogen or methyl,
by bromination of substituted toluenes of the

formula II


with a brominating agent selected from the group:
bromine, bromine salts or hydrogen bromide where

appropriate in the form of its aqueous solution,
at from 20 to 95°C, wherein the bromination is

carried out in the presence of an azo carbonitrile
or of an azo carboxylic ester and in the presence

of an oxidizing agent.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein from 0.5
to 1 equivalent of an oxidizing agent is employed

in the case of elemental bromine as brominating
agent, and from 1.5 to 2 equivalents of an

oxidizing agent are employed in the case of
bromides or hydrogen bromide. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein hydrogen
peroxide, peracetic acid, chlorine, sodium

hypochlorite (chlorine bleaching solution), sodium
bromate or potassium peroxydisulfate are used as

oxidizing agent.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein hydrogen
peroxide is used as oxidizing agent and is

initially present together with the substrate to
be brominated at up to 50°C.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the bromination is carried out in a two-phase

system.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the bromination is carried out

continuously.
