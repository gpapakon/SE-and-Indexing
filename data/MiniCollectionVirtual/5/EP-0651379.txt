<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium having a magnetic layer on one surface of a nonmagnetic support and a back 
coat layer on the other surface, wherein the back coat layer contains two kinds of carbon black having different average 

particle sizes and a binder containing two kinds of copolymer. One of the copolymers is copolymer A comprising 
vinyl chloride, alkylcarboxylic acid/vinyl ester and vinyl alcohol and having an average degree of polymerisation 

of 300 to 600, and the other is copolymer B further containing an amino group and having an average degree of 
polymerisation of 200 to 800. The present invention accomplishes a magnetic recording medium having a back coat 

layer having an excellent surface property, high electromagnetic conversion characteristics, high travel stability and 
high travel durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium including a back coat layer.As recordings are made at shorter wavelength and higher
density than ever before, the magnetic layer of a magnetic
recording medium is required to have higher surface smoothness
and more improved running stability. Thus, the importance of
the back coat layer used with the magnetic recording medium as
means for achieving improved surface smoothness and running
stability becomes now steadily increasing.The electromagnetic characteristics of the magnetic
recording medium are enhanced by improving the surface
roughness (Ra) of the back coat layer and thereby making the
surface thereof smooth. However, the magnetic recording medium
drops in running stability, as the surface of the back coat
layer becomes smooth or the coefficient of friction µ of the
back coat layer increases. As the surface roughness of the
back coat layer is increased to enhance the running stability
of the magnetic recording medium, there is a drop of the
surface properties of the magnetic layer, resulting in a drop
of the electromagnetic characteristics thereof. For the back 
coat layer, it is thus desired that its surface be made so
smooth that its surface properties can be improved with a drop
of the coefficient of friction µ. This enables the magnetic
recording medium to be improved in terms of running stability
and yet without giving rise to any considerable deterioration
of the electromagnetic characteristics of the magnetic layer.One way to achieve smoothness is to decrease the average
particle diameter of carbon black, fine inorganic particle or
other filler contained in the back coat layer. This enables
the surface of the back coat layer to be smoothened with some
improvements in Ra and electromagnetic characteristics, but
causes the coefficient of friction µ to become too high to
obtain good-enough running stability.To solve these problems, it has been put forward to use
two kinds of filler (e.g., carbon black or fine inorganic )
particles of varying particle diameters, use fillers and
binders at specific quantitative ratios, or place some specific
limitation on the average surface roughness Ra, as typically
set forth in JP-A 54-21248, JP-A 57-53825, JP-A 59-14127, JP-A
60-45938, JP-B 4-79054, JP-B 4-81256, and JP-B 4-81261.All these proposals make use of fillers having extremely
varying particle diameters for the purpose of lowering the
average surface roughness Ra, thereby achieving good-enough
electromagnetic characteristics and
