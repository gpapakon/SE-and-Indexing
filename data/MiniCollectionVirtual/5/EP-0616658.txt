<ABSTRACT>
A hand washing and rinsing unit which operates automatically without the need for the user to touch any part of the unit. When the user's hands are inserted into a wash basin (12), a proximity switch (30) actuates the system to switch on a supply of water through a supply line (18). After a predetermined time interval such as 5 to 8 seconds, a metered quantity of liquid soap from a supply (28) is dispensed onto the user's hands, and the supply of water continues to enable the soap to be washed off. The system incorporates an electronic monitoring system to record each use, this being triggered only when soap has been dispensed, so that it is not possible to have a wash recorded merely by wetting the hands for a few seconds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for washing and
rinsing hands, and is particularly suitable for use in
premises where food is prepared or in other premises
where regular hand washing is essential and needs to
be monitored.Hand washing units are known which include proximity
sensors which automatically switch on a watersupply
when hands are inserted into a wash basin, thereby
avoiding the need for manual contact with any taps or
switches and thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination.
In one known type of unit, the washing water supplied
has a hand washing detergent or disinfectant component
dissolved in it, for example an iodophor.Hygiene regulations in premises such as restaurants,
shops and factories in which food is handled have
become increasingly stringent in recent years. Generally,
the management is held responsible for ensuring that
all employees wash their hands properly, for example
after using the lavatory, before returning to work. It is
however difficult for hand washing regulations to be
properly enforced unless it can be comprehensively
monitored. In particular, although an employee may be
seen to visit a wash basin it is difficult to ensure that he
does more than run his fingers under the tap. Also, it is
difficult to ensure that soap is used during each hand
wash, or indeed to provide soap which can be used without
the risk of cross-contamination.This problem is solved by means of a hand washing
and rinsing unit as described in Claim 1.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the supply
of water and soap is controlled by timing relays triggered
by a proximity sensor so that water flows for an
initial period of a few seconds after which soap is fed to
the mixing valve for a few seconds, for example by
means of a dosing pump, and thereafter water continues
to flow for a period of for example 30 to 40 seconds to
enable the soap to be rinsed off.The electronic monitoring system, which records
each hand wash, may for example be operated by
means of user codes, so as to record the number of
times each person working on the premises uses the
hand wash unit during the course of a day. The system
can be linked to a computer which records the name of
each person using the unit and the time and duration of
each use.In a simpler system, the proper use of the unit may
be arranged simply to trigger a counter so as to indicate
to the management the frequency of use. The counter
is arranged not to register a use until soap has been
dispensed.Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be
de

<CLAIMS>
A hand washing and rinsing unit for a wash basin,
comprising a water supply (53), a water outlet (56) with a water

supply (53, 54) thereto, means (20, 32, 60) for automatically
switching on the water supply when hands are inserted below the

water outlet, a liquid soap dispenser (26, 28, 58) arranged to
dispense soap onto a user's hands after water has been dispensed

through the water outlet for a predetermined period during a wash
cycle and an electronic monitoring system to record each hand

wash, characterised in that the water outlet (56) is positioned
adjacent a soap outlet (58) and an infrared proximity sensor (60)

on an underside of a part (52) of a housing (50) which projects
forwardly above a hand wash basin and which contains the liquid

soap dispenser, whereby when hands are positioned below the water
outlet the infrared proximity sensor causes the water supply to

be switched on, whereupon soap is dispensed through the soap
outlet onto the user's hands after said predetermined period, and

in that the monitoring system is arranged to record a wash only
if, after the user's hands have been inserted below the wa
ter
outlet, the hands are kept below the water outlet and soap

dispenser until soap has been dispensed. 
A hand washing and rinsing unit according to claim
1 wherein the supply of water and soap

is controlled by timing relays triggered by a proximity
sensor (60) so that water flows for a predetermined

initial period, after which soap is dispensed
for a predetermined period and thereafter

water continues to flow for a further predetermined
period or until hands are withdrawn from below the

water outlet (56).
A hand washing and rinsing unit according to any
preceding claim wherein the soap is supplied by

means of a dosing pump (26).
A hand washing and rinsing unit according to any
preceding claim further comprising an integral hand

wash basin.
A hand washing and rinsing unit according to any
preceding claim wherein the monitoring system includes

a digital display (62) to indicate the number
of times the soap has been dispensed.
A hand washing and rinsing unit according to any
preceding claim wherein the electronic monitoring

system includes a central computer arranged to
record the name of each individual using the unit,

electronic input means (34) being provided to enable
the user to enter a user code.
