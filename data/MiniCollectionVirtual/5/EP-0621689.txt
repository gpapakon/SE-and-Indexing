<ABSTRACT>
A VCO includes an oscillator (13) and a controller 
(12) for controlling the operation of the oscillator. 

The oscillator (13) is formed by connecting odd number 
of stages of delay circuits (11-1 to 11-n) in a ring 

form. The controller (12) creates a second control 
voltage (
Vc
) based on an input first control voltage 
(Vc). The second control voltage (
Vc
) is set in a 
symmetrical relation to the first control voltage (Vc) 

with respect to an intermediate potential between the 
power supply (V
DD
) and the ground (GND) set as a 
reference. Each of the delay circuits (11-1 to 11-n) 

includes an inverter (15), first and second current 
control circuits, and first and second current value 

setting circuits. The inverter (15) includes a first 
transistor of first conductivity type and a second transistor 

of second conductivity type to receive and output 
a signal. The first current control circuit is connected 

between the first transistor and the ground 
(GND), for controlling a current flowing
 in the first 
transistor when the first transistor is set in the conductive 

state according to the first control voltage 
(Vc). The first current value setting circuit sets the 

minimum value of the current flowing in the first transistor. 
The second current control circuit is connected 

between the second transistor and the power supply 
(V
DD
), for controlling a current flowing in the second 
transistor when the second transistor is set in the conductive 

state according to the second control voltage 
(
Vc
). The second current value setting circuit sets the 
minimum value of the current flowing in the second transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a voltage controlled 
oscillator (VCO), and more particularly to a VCO used as 
a local oscillator of a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit. FIG. 1 shows an example of the construction of the 
conventional VCO. The oscillator is built in "YM3623" 
(Digital Audio Interface Receiver) made by NIHON GAKKI 
SEIZOU KABUSHIKI KAISHA and is disclosed in the catalog 
No. LSI-1136230, p. 5. The VCO shown in FIG. 1 has n-stage (n is an odd 
number) delay circuits 11-1 to 11-n connected in a ring 
form. As is represented by the delay circuit 11-1, each 
of the delay circuits 11-1 to 11-n includes P-channel 
MOS transistors P1, P2 and N-channel MOS transistors N1, 
N2. The MOS transistors P2 and N2 constitute a complementary 
inverter, the current path of the MOS transistor 
P1 is connected between the source of the MOS transistors 
P2 and a power supply VDD, and the current path 
of the MOS transistor N1 is connected between the source 
of the MOS transistors N2 and a ground terminal GND. 
The gate of the MOS transistor P1 is connected to the 
ground terminal GND and the gate of the MOS transistor 
N1 is applied with a control voltage Vc. The output 
node of the first stage delay circuit 11-1 is connected 
to the input node of the second stage delay circuit 
11-2, the output node of the second stage delay circuit 
11-2 is connected to the input node of the third stage  
 
delay circuit 11-3, and in the same manner, the outputs 
of the delay circuits 11-3 to 11-(n-1) are respectively 
connected to the input nodes of the next stage delay 
circuits 11-4 to 11-n. The output node of the n-th 
stage delay circuit 11-n is connected to the input node 
of the first stage delay circuit 11-1. An oscillation 
output OSC is generated from the n-th stage delay circuit 
11-n. If the delay time of each of the delay circuits 
11-1 to 11-n shown in FIG. 1 is Td, the oscillation frequency 
fosc. of the oscillator is expressed by the 
following equation. 
fosc. = 1/(Td × n)  
where n indicates the number of stages of the delay circuits. The delay time Td depends on the time constant τup 
(= C × (rP1 + rP2)) determined by the ON resistances 
rP1, rP2 of the MOS transistors P1, P2 and the parasitic 
capacitance C of the next stage gate capacitor or the 
like at the time of rise and depends on the time 
constant τdown (= C × (rN1 + rN2)) determined by the ON 
resistances rN1, rN2 of the MOS transistors N1, N2 and 
the parasitic capacitance C at the time of fall. 
Therefore, the following relation can be obtained.
