<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a plastic pipe having improved resistance, inter alia, to methanol-containing fuels and having improved mechanical properties. This is achieved by a multilayer plastic pipe comprising at least     I. an outer layer II. an interlayer, adjacent to the inner layer, made from a moulding composition based on a mixture of     a. polyamide (nylon) and   b. polyglutarimide,   III. an inner layer made from a moulding composition based on polyvinylidene fluoride where the adjacent layers are in each case adhesively bonded to one another.   The invention allows plastic pipes having the desired improved property profile to be obtained.
