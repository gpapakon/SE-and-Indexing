<ABSTRACT>
A system for creating still image or video collections for guests of
amusement parks and the like a) identifies individuals by a unique tag assigned to the

individual, b) automatically records the images of the individuals while they are at
various attractions, c) collects the images over a communications network, d)

arranges the images in a collection, and e) presents a personal set of collected images
to the guest. In one embodiment of the invention, cameras are located throughout an

amusement park. Each guest is associated with a unique identifier. This identifier
may be contained within a readable tag, e.g., a card, badge or pendant. Tag readers

identify guest when they are at a particular location and provide identification and
location information to a control system. A communications network is used to

interconnect the cameras, tag readers, control system and image recording devices.
The control system controls the recording and storage of the appropriate image(s)

associated with that guest. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the images
of the guest may be associated with prerecorded images of the amusement park.

Advantageously, a reporting system captures information on guest traffic patterns
throughout their visit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image capture and particularly to the capturing and
creation of customized videos or photo albums.Guests of amusement parks, golf courses, ski resorts and the like, which may be
referred to herein generally as "predefined areas" or, by example, as "amusement
parks", often desire to capture a still image or video record of their visit. (The term
"video" is used herein according to its conventional meaning and, therefore, includes any
corresponding associated audio information.) To do so, they often must lug around with
them still or video cameras and have somebody available who can take their picture.
This tends to be inconvenient, especially for the person who has to do the picture-taking
In some cases there is no person available to do the picture-taking. As a result there are
undesired gaps in the recorded images. Furthermore, it is not always possible to obtain
the desired picture, because the camera cannot be situated in such a way as to capture
the desired field of view. There also may be problems with lighting and motion.One prior art solution is for the amusement park to provide a person whose
responsibility it is to take particular predefined pictures which are then sold to the guest.
Typically, this is limited to still pictures only. Another prior art solution is to have a
camera trained at a fixed location for automatically capturing images in response to a
mechanical switch or a radio signal. Such systems, however, are limited to capturing the
object in which the triggering device is located. For example, in an amusement park
setting, the triggering device would be located in each car of a ride. Each car is
automatically photographed and the guest, upon conclusion of the ride, can decide if he
wishes to purchase the individual picture. These prior art techniques are insufficient to
provide a satisfying still image or video recollection for the guest.The reader is referred to US-A-4 943 854, JP-A-01 158377, JP-A-01 158374.
Claim 1 is delimited against DE-A-3447064
which
discloses a tracking device that includes a four-way
directional antenna that tracks an object detected by the antenna. The antenna is
arranged in the shape of a pyramid in the searching direction and an evaluation
electronics detects different infrared light intensity or photodiodes with different light
incident angles from the object to detect and track the object.The problems with prior art still image or video collection for amusement parks and 
the like are overcome, in accordance with the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in a predefined area including

a plurality of cameras (115), 
CHARACTERIZED BY
a plurality of tag readers (113), each tag reader (113) being associated with at
least one of said cameras (115) for supplying information as to locations of guests who want

their images captured in said predefined area, each guest having a unique identifying tag;
a communications network (105) for transporting at least images captured by
said cameras (115); and
an image storage system (123) for storing images captured by said cameras
(115) that is responsive to information supplied from said tag readers (113) to produce for

each guest a personal image collection reflecting his visit to the predefined area.
The apparatus as defined in claim 1 further 
characterized by
 means for indicating
(117) that the image from a particular camera is being recorded.
The apparatus as defined in claim 1 or 2 further 
characterized by
 auxiliary trigger
means (119) for controlling the initiation of recording of at least one of said cameras (115).
The apparatus as defined in claim 1, 2 or 3 further 
characterized in that
 the images
are recorded for a particular guest only from selections of said cameras (115) in response to

prestored selections (405) made by said particular guest.
The apparatus as defined in claim 1,2,3 or 4 further 
characterized in that
, prior to
recording of any images captured by said cameras (115) in response to said tag readers, (113),

a media recording in said image storage system (123) is prerecorded with stock video of said
predefined area.
