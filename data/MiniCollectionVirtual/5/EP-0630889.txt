<DESCRIPTION>
Pharmacologically active derivatives of 2-(benzimidazol-2-yl)-1,3-diaminopropane 
and the process for their preparation 
are the object of the present invention. More particularly 
the derivatives of 2-(benzimidazol-2-yl)-1,3-diaminopropane 
belong to the class of compounds of the general formula 
wherein: 
RIs selected from the group consisting of 
ethoxyethyl, allyloxyethyl, benzyl, 4-fluorobenzyl 
and 2-tetrahydrofurfuryl; Ra and Rbrepresent, independently one from the other, a 
saturated or unsaturated alkyl containing from 1 
to 4 carbon atoms or they may form, together with 
the nitrogen atom to which they are bound, a 
heterocyclic ring having 5 or 6 members, such as, 
for example, the pyrrolidine or piperidine group. A further object of the invention is formed by the non-toxic 
addition salts of the compounds of formula (I) with suitable 
pharmaceutically acceptable acids. In particular the 
poly-addition salts with the halogen acids, such as 
hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acid and, more  
 
particularly, the dichlorohydrate salts being preferred. The compounds (I) are obtained by reaction of 
2-methylbenzimidazoles of formula 
wherein R is as above specified, with formaldehyde, as such 
or in polymeric form, and with a suitable salt of a 
secondary amine of formula:

H-N-Ra(Rb)   (III)


 
The reaction is carried out using two or more molar 
equivalents of formaldehyde and of the salt of the secondary 
amine (III) for molar equivalent of 2-methylbenzimidazole 
(II) in the presence of a suitable solvent selected between 
water or a straight or branched alcohol containing from 1 to 
5 carbon atoms, or their suitable mixtures, at a temperature 
between room temperature and reflux temperature of the 
solution, for a period of time between 10 minutes and 12 
hours. The compounds (I) of the invention are preferably isolated 
as addition salts with halogen acids from which, by 
neutralization with a stoichiometrical quantity of aqueous 
diluted solutions of bases such as hydrates, bicarbonates 
and/or alkaline carbonates or alkaline-earth carbonates or 
with ammonia, the corresponding free bases may be obtained.  From the compounds (I), In the form of free bases, other 
addition salts with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable 
acids may be eventually obtained. The preferred reaction 
conditions are those which use from 2.3 to 2.4 molar 
equivalents of formaldehyde and amine salt (III). The amine 
salts of formula (III) are preferably represented by 
hydrochlorides and the preferred reaction
