<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated 
circuits which are protected from the environment. These 
circuits are inexpensive to fabricate and have improved 
performance and reliability. Modern electronic circuits must be able to 
withstand a wide variety of environmental conditions such as 
moisture, ions, heat and abrasion. A significant amount of 
work has been directed toward various protective measures to 
minimize the exposure of such circuits to adverse conditions 
and thereby increase their reliability and life. Many prior art processes for protecting electronic 
circuits have involved sealing or encapsulating the circuits 
after they have been interconnected. For example, it is 
known in the art to use materials such as silicones, 
polyimides, epoxies, other organics and plastics to 
encapsulate interconnected circuits. The above materials, 
however, are of only limited value since most remain 
permeable to environmental moisture and ions. Similarly, interconnected circuits have also been 
sealed within ceramic packages. This has proven to be 
relatively effective in increasing device reliability and is 
currently used. The added size, weight and cost involved, 
however, inhibits widespread application in the electronic 
industry. The use of lightweight ceramic protective coatings 
on electronic devices has also been suggested by Haluska et 
al. in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,756,977 and 4,749,631. The present 
inventor has found that when ceramic silica coatings are  
 
applied to integrated circuits at the wafer stage and when 
the bond pads are subsequently opened by removing a portion 
of the coating, the resultant circuits remain sealed and 
exhibit increased reliability and life. Sealing circuits at the wafer stage is also known 
in the art. For example, it is known in the art to coat 
fabricated integrated circuits with ceramic materials such as 
silica and/or silicon nitride by CVD techniques. These 
coatings are then opened at the bond pads for the application 
of leads. The wafers coated in this manner, however, have 
inadequate reliability and life (Byrne, U.S. Patent 
No. 5,136,364). In contrast, the present invention provides a 
simple process for the protection of integrated circuits 
which involves sealing the bond pads of integrated circuits 
with diffusion barrier layers and sealing the remainder of 
the device with passivation layers. The present invention relates to sealed integrated 
circuits. These circuits comprise a circuit subassembly 
having bond pads. A primary passivation
