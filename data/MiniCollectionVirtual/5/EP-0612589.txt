<ABSTRACT>
In a control device for electric tools, in particular for electric hand tools such as (one-speed or multi-speed) hand drills, drilling and percussion hammers, screwdrivers and the like, it is proposed, to arrest the tool spindle (lock function) by positive engagement, to arrange on the tool housing an arresting slide (20) which is accessible for manual actuation and drives an axial member (21), which arrests the spindle, for positive engagement in a part (13) which rotates in a manner fixed in terms of rotation with the tool spindle, the axial member being guided rearwards into the electric control region (17) for the drive motor and releasing the displacement movement of the arresting slide only when the electric motor is dead.

A switching device in an electric tool, in particular an electric hand tool such as a single-speed 
or multiple-speed hand drill, a hammer drill, a screwdriver and the like, for locking 

the tool spindle, also called a locking function, by engagement with positive locking, 

characterized by
 a locking slide (20) which is accessible for manual actuation on the 
tool housing (10) and which drives an axial member (19, 21) preventing the spindle from 

making any rotational movement for engaging with positive locking in a part rotating in 
a rotationally fixed manner with the tool spindle (14), wherein a switch-off position - 

produced by a preceding switching step of an electrical switching means - for the electric 
motor (13) is detected by the axial member (19, 21) which is guided backwards into the 

electrical switching region for the drive motor (13) and at the same time the displacement 
movement of the locking slide (20) is released exclusively for this state of the electric 

motor (13) without current. 
A switching device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the axial member (19, 
21) - driven by the locking slide (20) - for the locking function comprises a front locking 

rod (21) which passes through a part (22) of the gearing housing and which is coupled to 
a rear sliding member (19) which detects the electrical switching position of the electric 

motor (13) by means of a sensor member (18). 
A switching device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the locking rod (21) 
engages by a front blocking end (22) in peripheral openings (23) in a gearwheel (13) 

connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the tool spindle (14) and meshing with the 

driving pinion (12a) of the electric motor with the displacement movement directed forwards 
to receiving the tool-receiving means when driven by the outer locking slide (20). 
A switching device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the electric 
motor (13) is a universal motor with a control means for reversing the direction of rotation 

by means of a rotatable brush-holder ring and a neutral setting without current, of 
which the setting ring (16) accessible for actuation from the outside has an open control 

recess (17) - into which the rear sensor member (18) on the axial member engages - in a 
neutral setting without current for the drive motor (13). 
A switching device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the sensor member (18) 
is part of a sliding member (19) which is coupled to the locking rod (21) and which, surrounding  

 
the locking rod (21) in part, is guided forwards in the direction of the tool-receiving 

means and is mounted in the motor housing and/or by adjacent components so 
as to slide axially. 
A switching device according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the locking 
slide (20) engages with transverse ribs (20, 27) in annular grooves (25) and/or recesses in 

the locking rod (21) and the sliding member (19) respectively and itself has a recessed 
grip (20a) for its displacement. 
A switching device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that
 a pre-stressing 
spring (26) is provided which pre-stresses the axial sliding member in the direction 

contrary to the locking position. 
A switching device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the pre-stressing spring 
(26) surrounds the locking rod (21) as a compression spring and is supported at one end 

on a stationary part of the housing and at the other end on a front annular face of the 
sliding member (19) which surrounds the rear part of the locking rod at least in part and 

secures it axially undetachably by annular projections, stop, ribs and the like. 
A switching device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the axial member is 
mounted on an intermediate partition of the housing.
