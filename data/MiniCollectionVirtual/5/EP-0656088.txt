<ABSTRACT>
The double hook is a clip studied for being used in building above all to fasten longitudinal iron bars to the reinforcement stirrups. This clip, consisting of two elastic hooks (A) and two fixed seats arranged crosswise, can be opened exerting a light pressure with fingers and placed in the crossing-point of two adequate bars; when the clip is loose its hooks closing again on the same bar push it against the other one blocked by the proper seats, thus creating the desired bond.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "DOUBLE HOOK TO FASTEN CROSSED BARS"DescriptionThe invention relates to a clip permitting to fix cros¬ sed bars, even coupled ones.Such clip consists of two distinct and identical hooks of new shape for fastening a bar, that join together on the top in crossed direction to the hooks in order to form the jaws and the seats of the bar. Once the hooks are opened, exerting a pressure on the jaws, the clip can be placed on the crossing-point of the two bars and then when they are loose they close again pushing the bar on the crossed one which is blocked by the proper seats.Such clip may be usefully employed in reinforced-concre- te building as it permits quickly and safely a bond between the longitudinal iron bars and the stirrups. At present the binding of longitudinal bars to the rein¬ forcement stirrups takes place by the use of iron wire and such, by welding and, not very often, by some kind of hooks. The welding process requires complex equipment which is difficult to use in building site, and the hooks are not very practical; both methods need skilled labour. The iron wire permits to bind, in order to cut down on costs and time, two or more concurrent bars to the detri¬ ment of the "air-gaps" required by rules. All this caused, especially in the past, continuos disagreements between the building management and the executor contractors. In this area there is another little-observed rule: the abutemeήt stone. Such abutment stone and air-gap are required by the regulations in order to make the execu-1SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

ted work correspond with the projected one and to en- sure its endurance.Many years ago, the technologic development put on the market a special distance piece 06for the abutment sto¬ ne but it is not very used for its cost and for the long time of exposure, so still nowadays we rely on the will and skill of those employed on casting.In order to make easier the work of the fitter of rein¬ forced concrete bars and to fasten the stirrups to the longitudinal bar in a quickly and safetely way (this bond can be removed); in order to reduce the time of ex- posure and costs and in the meanwhile ensuring the com¬ pliance with the regulations about the abutment stone and air-gap, this study carried out by Ing. Dragone with the cooperation of his son Ing. Antonio Dragone, has lead to the realization of a practical clip called "double hook" provided with a new form of seats for bars in one direction and with hooks that can be elastically opened in the crossed direction and, as already said, when they

 Claims
1) All the clips, provided with simple of double couple of jaws, of symmetric or asymmetric form, using, even in a pa¬ rtial way the innovation of two seats and two hooks place- d crosswise and joined together so that they can be mana¬ ged simultaneously with fingers and capabJe of fasten the crossed bars either single or coupled ones.
2) All the clips as indicated by the previous point 1), but realized with two seats and two hooks.
3) All the clips as indicated by the previous point 1), but provided with a seat and two hooks .
4) All the clips as indicated by the previous point 1), but provided with several seats and hooks.
5) All the clips as indicated by the previous point 1), but provided with one or more hooks in a direction and one or more hooks in the crossed direction.
6) All the clips to fasten longitudinal bars to the rein¬ forcement stirrups based on the innovation as for the po¬ ints 1,2,3,4 and 5 and having the jaws, above called bo¬ dies (B), acting as distance piece for the abutment stone.
7) All the clips realized according to the previous poin¬ ts 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 and having lateral extensions acting as distance piece for the abutment stone.
