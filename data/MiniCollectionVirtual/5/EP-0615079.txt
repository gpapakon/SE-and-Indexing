<ABSTRACT>
A continuously variable transmission control system 
having adjustable driving and driven sheave assemblies 

(124,126) connected drivably by a torque transfer belt or 
chain (144), each sheave assembly having a fluid pressure 

operated servo with a pressure chamber, distribution of 
control pressure to one servo (150,158,162) effecting a 

transmission ratio adjustment, control of pressure 
distribution to the other servo (202,210) resulting in a 

clamping force, a ratio control valve (246) for controlling 
distribution of pressure to the ratio controlling servo to 

effect upshifts and downshifts, provision being made for 
stabilizing the ratio control valve by providing for flow 

entry to the ratio control valve that is unrestricted, flow 
distribution to the ratio controlling servo having a 

controlled restriction whereby stability of the ratio 
control valve is achieved, fluid displaced from the ratio 

controlling servo being adapted to circulate through the 
ratio control valve to the inlet side (372) of the control 

system pump (70,72).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention comprises improvements in a valve system 
for a continuously variable transmission in an automotive 
vehicle driveline. The control valve system of this invention is adaptable 
for a transmission of the kind disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,767,384, from which the features of the first part 
of claim 1 are known. EP-A-0235712 discloses a hydraulic control system for a 
continuously variable transmission for an automotive 
vehicle, the transmission having a first and a second pulley 
provided on respective first and second shafts connecting 
the first and second pulleys, and a first and second 
hydraulic cylinder for changing effective diameters of the 
first and second pulleys. The control system includes a 
first pressure regulating valve for regulating the pressure 
of a fluid delivered from a pressure source, and therefore 
establishing a first line pressure, a shift-control valve 
for applying the first line pressure to one of the first and 
second cylinders, while simultaneously permitting a flow of 
the fluid from the other cylinder, thereby changing the 
effective diameters of the first and second pulleys, and a 
second pressure regulating valve for regulating the pressure 
of a discharge flow of the fluid flowing from the above-indicated 
other cylinder through the shift-control valve, 
and thereby establishing a second line pressure lower than 
the first line pressure. EP-A-0117,264 discloses a control system for a 
continuously variable V-belt transmission wherein for the 
purpose of preventing an undesirable rapid drop in pressure 
in a cylinder chamber of a drive pulley flow restrictor is 
provided to restrict the flow of oil discharged from the 
cylinder chamber upon rapid change in reduction ratio of the 
continuously variable V-belt transmission. US-A-4651776 discloses a fluid pressure control valve 
for a hydraulic actuator has a valve body having a valve 
bore and a fluid port for discharging a fluid toward the 
hydraulic actuator, and a spool slidably received in the  
 
valve bore. The spool has a cylindrical spool section 
slidably fitted in the valve bore for closing the fluid port 
and a tapered spool section having a conical shape for 
opening the fluid port through annular open clearance of a 
variable area between the conical surface of the spool and 
the cylindrical surface of the valve bore. Between the 
cylindrical ad tapered spool sections, there is formed an 
annular groove or an annular face forming a step for 
preventing particles of dust suspended in the fluid

<CLAIMS>
A continuously variable transmission for a vehicle 
having an engine comprising a primary sheave assembly (124) 

connected drivably to said engine and a secondary sheave 
assembly (126) connected drivably to a driven member, a 

drive belt (144) drivably connecting said sheave assemblies, 
primary servo means for adjusting the pitch radius of said 

primary sheave assembly (124), secondary servo means for 
adjusting the pitch radius of said secondary sheave assembly 

(126); 

a control system for controlling transmission ratio 
comprising a pump (70/72), a control valve circuit 

connecting each servo means with said pump; 
each sheave assembly (124,126) including a pressure 
chamber of expansible volume, an increase in the pitch 

radius of one sheave assembly being accompanied by a 
decrease in the pitch radius of the other sheave assembly; 
a ratio control valve means (246) in said valve circuit 

for controlling distribution of pressure to said primary 
servo means; 
said primary servo means comprising an upshift pressure 
chamber (166) and a downshift pressure chamber (164); and 
said control valve means (246) in said valve circuit 
controlling distribution of pressure to said upshift and 

downshift pressure chambers from said pump; characterised in that 
said ratio control valve means comprises a 
valve chamber, a movable valve spool (432) in said valve 

chamber, said valve chamber having first and second ports 
communicating with said upshift chamber (166), third and 

fourth ports communicating with said downshift chamber, and 
outlet porting communicating with the inlet side of said 

pump; and in that 
said valve spool have flow metering lands (428,430) 
registering with said outlet porting and with said second 

and fourth ports, the flow of fluid toward said valve 
chamber from said pump and toward said first port and said  

 
third port from said upshift and downshift chambers, 

respectively, being unrestricted by said lands. 
A system as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
control system comprises an electronic controller including 

means responsive to operating variables of said transmission 
for developing a control pressure signal that is an 

indication of a commanded transmission ratio, said valve 
circuit including means for subjecting said valve spool to 

said control pressure signal whereby the position of said 
valve spool is determined by said control pressure signal. 
A transmission as claimed in Claim 2, including a 
pump inlet flow passage connecting said inlet side of said 

pump with said third port, and flow directing means in said 
inlet flow passage for connecting velocity pressure in said 

inlet flow passage into an increased static pressure at said 
inlet side of said pump thereby supercharging said pump. 
A transmission as claimed in Claim 3, including a 
sump and filter assembly, said inlet flow passage being in 

fluid communication with said sump and filter assembly, said 
flow directing means being adapted to induce filtered oil 

from said sump and filter assembly into said inlet side of
