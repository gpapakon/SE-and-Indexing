<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device, in particular a pusher gelation device, for filling one or more casting moulds (20) with pourably liquid substances, the individual components of which are fed by means of pumping devices (3, 4) via lines (5, 6) which can be shut off to at least one piston-cylinder arrangement (7), from which the individual components are passed to a mixing chamber (18) and from there to the respective casting mould (20). To be able to process in particular abrasive casting compositions of high viscosity and short pot life, it is provided that the at least one piston-cylinder arrangement (7) is designed for a significantly higher operating pressure than that operating pressure prevailing in the pumping devices (3, 4) and that the mixing chamber (18) has a relatively small volume.

Device, in particular pressure gelling device, for the filling of one or more casting
moulds (20) with pourable liquid substances, the individual components of which are fed

by way of ducts (5, 6), which can be shut off, at a first conveying pressure by means of
pump equipments (3, 4) to at least one piston-cylinder arrangement (7; 29, 30), from which

the individual components are conducted to a mixing chamber (18; 39) and from there to
the respective casting mould (20) and the at least one piston-cylinder arrangement (7; 29,

30) is constructed for the production of a second conveying pressure, which is greater than
the first conveying pressure, wherein a conveying piston (8, 32, 33, 47) subdivides the

cylinder of the piston-cylinder arrangement (7; 29, 30) into at least one pump chamber (9,
10) for the pourable liquid substances and into a working chamber standing in flow

connection with working fluid, characterised in that between each pump chamber (9, 10)
and either the working chamber or a chamber adjoining the at least one pump chamber (9,

10), there is provided a single seal for an intermediate fluid (46) between the conveying
piston (8, 32, 33, 47) and the cylinder of the piston-cylinder arrangement (29, 30) and the

operation surfaces of the conveying piston (8, 32, 33, 47), which get into contact with the
pourable liquid substances and the pressure fluid or the intermediate fluid (46), are of

substantially the same size.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the at least one piston-cylinder
arrangement (7) comprises at least two metering chambers (9, 10) for the individual

components of the casting mass.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that at least two piston-cylinder
arrangements (29, 30) are provided for the individual components.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the at least one
piston-cylinder arrangement (7; 29, 30) comprises a drive piston (45), which is loadable by

pressure fluid (44), in particular hydraulic liquid, as well as a conveying piston (47), which
is drivable by the drive piston (45) by way of a gaseous and/or liquid intermediate fluid

(46), for the respective individual component mass or the casting mass, wherein the
intermediate fluid (46) is compatible with the respective components. 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the conveying piston (47)
comprises a piston rod (50), which extends through the drive piston (45) and through the

cylinder head (52), or the drive piston (45) comprises a piston rod (50), which extends
through the cylinder head (52), for ascertaining the storage content of component mass in

the respective piston-cylinder arrangement (29, 30).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the movements of
the piston elements (8; 32, 33) of the at least one piston-cylinder arrangement (7; 29, 30)

are coupled together either rigidly or variably with preselectable coupling ratio.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the coupling
between the piston elements (8; 32, 33) of the piston-cylinder arrangements (7; 29, 30)

takes place mechanically, electrically, electronically and/or by means of a pressure fluid.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the drive (31) for the
piston elements (32, 33) of the piston-cylinder arrangements (29, 30) is constructed for

maintaining the replenishing pressure on the respective casting mould (20) during the
gelling phase of the casting resin.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the drive for the
piston elements (32, 33) of the piston-cylinder arrangements (29, 30) is constructed for

either a variable drive ratio of the piston elements (32, 33) one among the other or a
variable mixture ratio of the individual components.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that a buffer element (37)
with upstream shut-off element, such as for example a non-return valve or a shut-off valve,

is arranged in the feed duct (36) to each casting mould (20).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that each casting mould
(20) is associated with a separate mixing chamber (39), preferably a static mixer, with

downstream buffer element (40) and shut-off elements (43), such as for example non-return
valves or shut-off valves, are arranged in the feed ducts (41, 42) for the individual

components to the mixing chambers (39). 
Device according to claim 10 or 11, characterised in that the piston of the buffer
elements (37 or 40) is spring-loaded, loadable by means of a pressure fluid or movable

mechanically.
