<ABSTRACT>
A precipitation method is proposed for the preparation of a 
rare earth phosphate powder by the reaction of a water-soluble salt 

of the rare earth element in an aqueous solution with an ammonium 
phosphate, which gives a rare earth phosphate powder consisting 

of non-agglomerate discrete particles having a spherical particle 
configuration suitable as a base material of rare earth-based 

phosphors. The method is characterized by the addition of the ammonium 
phosphate in the form of a powder to an acidic aqueous solution 

of the rare earth salt under specified conditions in contrast 
to the conventional method in which the ammonium phosphate is 

admixed in the form of an aqueous solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of spherical particles of a rare earth phosphate or, more particularly, 
to a method for the preparation of a rare earth phosphate 
powder having a spherical particle configuration capable of giving 
an advantage of removing the difficulty encountered in the recovery 
of the precipitates of the phosphate from the precipitation medium 
by filtration and suitable as a base material of a rare earth 
phosphate-based phosphor useful mainly as a green-emitting phosphor 
in fluorescent lamps. As is well known, cerium orthophosphate activated with terbium 
is a green-emitting phosphor and proposals have been made 
in Japanese Patent Kokai No. 60-10065 and No. 59-179578 and Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 1-41673 for a green-emitting rare 
earth phosphate-based phosphor containing one or more of the rare 
earth elements selected from yttrium, lanthanum and gadolinium 
in addition to cerium and terbium. It is generally accepted that the 
light-emitting efficiency of a rare earth-based phosphor is high 
when the particle configuration of the phosphor particles are as 
close to spherical as possible so that various proposals have been 
made heretofore in order to obtain spherical particles of a phosphor 
powder. For example, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 4-130014 proposes  
 
a method in which a powder of a rare earth phosphate as a 
base material of a rare earth-based phosphor is slurried in a suitable 
dispersion medium and the slurry is spray-dried by using a 
spray drier. This spray-drying method, however, is defective because 
the spherical particle obtained by this method is an agglomerate 
of a large number of fine primary particles so that the mechanical 
strength of such an agglomerate particle cannot be high 
enough to be readily disintegrated into the original fine particles 
resulting in poor workability in processing into a phosphor and decrease 
in the yield of the phosphor therefrom. Apart from the problem of the light-emitting efficiency of the 
rare earth phosphate-based phosphor, one of the serious problems 
in the preparation of a rare earth phosphate powder by the method 
of precipitation is that the recovery of the phosphate precipitates 
from the precipitation medium by filtration is a very time-consuming 
process. Accordingly, it is eagerly desired to improve the filtrability 
of precipitates of a rare earth phosphate in order to increase 
the productivity of the process. The present invention accordingly has an object to provide a
