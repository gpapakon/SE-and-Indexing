<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (11) is of channel shape, having longitudinal 
projections (25) at its respective sides for engagement with undercut 

grooves (24) in a face of a casing of a powered grinding tool (10) with 
which the adapter is intended to be fitted to sharpened chisels or other 

planar blades, in use, by means of a grinding wheel (20) of the tool. The 
adapter has an angularly adjustable guide plate (63) which carrier a 

slidable plate (70) having magnetic means (71a) for holding an attracted 
blade of an implement to be sharpened, the angle of the guide plate (63) 

causing the blade to be correctly sharpened by the wheel (20), in use, as 
the plate (70) is reciprocated across the wheel with the blade held 

correctly thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adapter which is intended to be fitted
to a powered grinding tool, the tool being primarily for use in the
sharpening, smoothing, cutting, abrading, honing etc., of implements,
such as drill bits, scissors, knives, chisels, planar blades and the like.Whilst attachments for an electric drill are known which can
carry out one or more of the various operations referred to above, their
major disadvantage is of course that the drill cannot be used for its
intended purpose whilst the attachment is fitted.An object of the invention is to provide an adapter for a powered
grinding tool in an efficient and convenient manner.According to the invention there is provided an adapter for
releasable engagement with a powered grinding tool having a casing, a
motor adapted to be driven by power supply means, a rotatable shaft
drivable, in use, by the motor, and a rotatable grinding wheel to which
drive is transmitted in use, from said shaft, the adapter having means for it
to be engaged with and automatically secured by latching to said casing at
a work station of the tool, in use, and to be removed therefrom
subsequently, and defining a location which, when the adapter is fitted to
said tool at said work station thereof, in use, provides for correct
positioning between part of an implement at said location and said
grinding wheel for said part to be worked by the wheel, when it is driven,
in use. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is an exploded, schematic perspective view showing a
powered grinding tool together with an adapter of the invention, as well
as two other adapters, for use with and storage at the tool;Figure 2 is a front perspective view of the tool, with a grinding
wheel thereof not shown;Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of the adapter of the
invention, intended for use in sharpening chisels and planar blades;Figure 4 is a top plan view of a base of a casing of the tool;Figure 5 is a side view of the casing base of Figure 4;Figure 6 is a front view of the casing, in a form different from
Figure 2;Figures 7 to 9 are respectively a rear view, a top view and a
side view of the casing;Figure 10 is a vertical section through the casing;Figure 11 is a diagrammatic view of part of the inside of the
tool showing a motor, fan grinding wheel and power supply means of
the tool; Figures 12 and 13 are front and rear perspective views
respectively of part of the adapter of Figure 3;Figures 14 to 16

An adapter for releasable engagement with a powered grinding
tool having a casing, a motor adapted to be driven by power supply

means, a rotatable shaft drivable, in use, by the motor, and a rotatable
grinding wheel to which drive is transmitted in use, from said shaft, the

adapter having means for it to be engaged with and automatically secured
by latching to said casing at a work station of the tool, in use, and to be

removed therefrom subsequently, and defining a location which, when the
adapter is fitted to said tool at said work station thereof, in use, provides

for correct positioning between part of an implement at said location and
said grinding wheel for said part to be worked by the wheel, when it is

driven, in use.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 1, comprising a lower portion
extending from said location, the lower portion being of generally channel

shape having spaced sides and there being said engagement means at said
sides respectively to enable said adapter to be automatically secured, in

use, to said casing of the tool to retain the adapter at said work station
against lateral movement.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the lower portion of
the adapter has engagement means for releasable inter-engagement with

co-operating means at a base of the tool to prevent longitudinal movement
of the adapter when it is secured at said work station.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein said
means at its sides are projections for engagement with complementary

undercut slots at the casing respectively, or vice versa. 
An adapter as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, comprising
at said location a slidable implement receiving element.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 5, wherein said implement
receiving element is slidable in a guideway of a guide member which

itself is angularly adjustable relative to a body of the adapter.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 6, wherein an upper end of the
body has an opening therein through which, in use, said grinding wheel

projects when the adapter is secured to said casing at said work station.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 7, wherein a side of said
implement receiving element terminates at said opening so that said part

of said implement carried on said element, in use, can be worked by the
grinding wheel when the adapter is fitted to said tool at said work

station, sliding movement of the implement receiving element being
transverse of the opening to move the implement part across the outer

peripheral surface of the wheel.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8, wherein said
guide member is received in a recess in a front face of the body of the

adapter, the recess having an arcuate surface on which a
complementarily shaped exterior surface of the guide member engages,

angular movement of the guide member in the recess, when the adapter
is fitted to said too
l at said work station, changing the angle of
engagement of said implement part with said outer peripheral surface of

the wheel. 
An adapter as claimed in Claim 9, wherein the guide member is
releasably held in a selected angular position in the recess by a clamping

member which clamps the guide member against a rear wall of the
recess.
An adapter as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 10, wherein
the implement receiving element includes magnetic means for holding

an attracted implement to the element.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 6, wherein an angular
adjustment scale is provided for guide member adjustment.
