<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the immunoassay
quantification of imipramine in a test sample or desipramine
in a test sample. In particular, the present invention relates
to assay methods, kits, antisera
and labeled reagents for the specific quantification of
imipramine in the presence of its metabolites, and for the
specific quantification of desipramine in the presence of its
metabolites and imipramine, preferably for use in a
fluorescence polarization immunoassay.Imipramine and desipramine are tricyclic antidepressant
drugs which are prescribed for the treatment of chronic
depression and are represented by Formula I and Formula II,
respectively:
When imipramine is the primary drug for such treatment,
desipramine is usually present as a naturally occurring
metabolite produced by demethylation of the tertiary nitrogen
of imipramine. Accordingly, desipramine is not only present
when it is prescribed as the primary drug for treatment of 
chronic depression, but is also present when imipramine is
employed as the primary drug for such treatment.The monitoring of therapeutic drug levels of imipramine
and desipramine in biological fluids such as serum, plasma,
whole blood, urine, and the like, has become very useful to
provide physicians with information to aid in patient
management. The monitoring of such drug levels enables
adjustment of patient dosage to achieve optimal therapeutic
effects, and helps avoid either subtherapeutic or toxic levels,
especially in the case of treatment with imipramine which
results in the presence of both imipramine and desipramine.
In this regard, since high levels of imipramine and
desipramine have been associated with central nervous
system disorders, cardiovascular toxicity, hypertension,
seizures, coma and death, the concentration of imipramine and
desipramine in a patient's blood must be maintained in a
therapeutic range, particularly since a wide interpatient
variation normally exists in human plasma for a given dose.Accordingly, since individuals vary greatly in their
response to treatment with imipramine or desipramine, it is
necessary to monitor the therapy by measuring both the levels
of imipramine and desipramine where imipramine is the
primary drug for treatment, or measuring the level of
desipramine where desipramine is the primary drug for
treatment, in, for example, the serum or plasma of the patient.
Concentrations below the desired therapeutic ranges are
proposed to be subtherapeutic for the treatment of depression,
while levels higher than the range can be
