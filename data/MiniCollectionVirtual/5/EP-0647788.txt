<ABSTRACT>
A tare supporting apparatus supports the tare 
of a structure required to have very high surface 

precision, without affecting the surface precision of 
the structure. For that, the tare supporting apparatus 

comprises a driving unit for moving a driven body in 
the direction of gravity with respect to a base, and a 

supporting unit for supporting the tare of the driven 
body at a position after driven, wherein the driving 

unit and supporting unit are so arranged that a drive 
force of the driving unit and a support force of the 

supporting unit are on a same axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
supporting apparatus for supporting the weight of a
machine structure, which may be applied to XY stages
for semiconductor fabricating apparatus, precision
machine tools, accurate measuring instruments, etc.Fig. 12 shows an example in which a
supporting apparatus is mounted in a machine structure.
In Fig. 12, numeral 1 designates a tilt stage. For
example, for mounting a wafer 3, the top surface 2 of
tilt stage 1 needs to have very high surface precision.
Numeral 4 denotes a guide for restricting only a
horizontal (Y-directional) motion of the tilt stage 1,
which allows motions in the vertical direction (Z-direction),
in an oblique direction, and in a direction
of rotation about the Z-axis, for example, using a
hydrostatic bearing. Through non-contact drive by a
plurality of linear motors 26 (26a, 26b,...), a
position along the Z-direction or the direction of
gravity, or inclination of tilt stage 1 can be
automatically controlled at a high speed with reference
to a base 6. Also, numeral 27 designates an air
cylinder, and one or more air cylinders support the 
tilt stage 1.Since the linear motors 26 transmit a force in
a non-contact state, they have such an effective
characteristic that Z-directional vibration of base 6
is not transmitted to the tilt stage 1. On the other
hand, because a heat value of linear motor is
proportional to the square of an electric current
flowing therethrough, heat becomes enormous with an
increase of drive force. Thermal deformation of
machine structure caused by the heat would result in a
fatal defect such as thermal deformation, for example,
of a wafer mounted on the tilt stage as an accurate
instrument. Accordingly, a design to minimize the
drive force is required for applications of linear
motor to accurate instruments. Thus, as in the above
example, it is general that an air cylinder or the like
is interposed so as to support the tilt stage.However, the above example for driving, for
example, tilt of wafer, has the following problems.
(1) The tilt stage could be deformed by
excessive constraint because a point of drive by linear
motors is not coincident with a support point by
the air cylinder.(2) In order to keep an amount of deformation
below a permissible value, it is necessary to receive 
the tare by a plane instead of the support point or to
increase the thickness of tilt stage so as to enhance the
rigidity of structure, which increases the size of
apparatus.  In either case, an amount of deformation is very
small, but it would be
