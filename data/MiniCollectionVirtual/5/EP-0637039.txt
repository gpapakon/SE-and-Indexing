<ABSTRACT>
A coil bobbin is formed by injection-molding a thermoplastic resin (A) having an elastic modulus of 8 x 10² 
kgf/mm² or more, and a thermal deformation temperature of 200°C or higher under a load of 18.6 kg/cm². The bobbin 

and an arm are integrally fixed to the actuator of a disk unit by use of a coupling member made of a thermpolastic 
resin (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an actuator for a disc unit
which comprises an arm and a moveable coil. In particular, the present invention relates
to a swing-type actuator for use in a magnetic disc unit, for example, a fixed magnetic
disc unit, having a magnetic head mounted thereon, wherein a functional member, such
as the magnetic head, swings so as to draw a circular arc locus.The conventional swing-type actuator has such
a structure as illustrated in the plan of Fig. 1 (a)
and the front view of Fig. 1 (b). In Fig. 1, numeral
1 denotes a yoke, numeral 2 a permanent magnet,
numeral 3 a strut, numeral 4 a magnetic gap, numeral 5
a moving coil, numeral 6 a junction member, numeral 7
an arm, and numeral 8 a shaft. In the following
figures, like parts or portions are denoted by like
numerals. The junction member 6 joins the moving coil
5, which is an air-core coil, to the arm 7.As illustrated in Fig. 1, the swing-type
actuator comprises the arm 7 formed of die-cast
aluminum, a magnesium alloy or the like and the moving
coil 5. The moving coil 5 is fixed to the arm 7 with
an adhesive or by insert molding using a thermoplastic
resin. The moving coil 5 is positioned in the
magnetic gap 4 sandwiched in between the permanent 
magnets 2, and, when the moving coil 5 is electrified,
a driving force around the shaft 8 acts on the moving
coil 5, so that the arm 7 swings around the shaft 8.
At that time, the smaller the gap between the moving
coil 5 and the permanent magnet 2 is, the more
effectively a high driving force can be obtained.The conventional moving coil 5 is generally
an air-core coil produced by providing a bond wire
comprising a coated wire having an adhesive film on
the surface thereof, spirally winding the bond wire
into a coil while applying heat or an alcohol thereto
to fuse the adhesive film and cooling the wound wire.
However, in the air-core coil, the dispersion of
diameter size of the above bond wire is so large that
constant adjustment is required in the winding step,
thereby permitting only an individual winding.
Further, complete in-parallel winding is difficult, so
that it is hard to render the end faces of the coil
parallel with each other and, therefore, the
dispersion of coil density is large. Therefore, there
is raised a problem that it is no feasible to decrease
the gap between the moving coil 5 and the permanent
magnet 2 to a desired level whereby an effective
driving force cannot be obtained.Meanwhile, in Japanese Patent Appln. Laid-Open
