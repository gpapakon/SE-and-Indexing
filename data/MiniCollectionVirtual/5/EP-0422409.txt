<ABSTRACT>
A water stop module for use with a spray nozzle 
printing press dampener includes a shield maintained in a 

housing having an aperture to allow undisrupted fluid flow 
therethrough and a guide track for directing the shield to 

block the aperture. A pair of cogwheels with sprockets in 
engaging relation with the shield are rotatable to drive 

the shield along the guide tracks by a regulated amount to 
enable the area of coverage of fluid emerging from the 

aperture to be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to offset lithographic 
printing presses having a spray rail and series of spray 
nozzles for supplying fluid to the press during printing 
operations. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
fluid stop device that acts in cooperation with the spray 
rail to provide a shield that enables control of the area 
of coverage achieved by fluid exiting the spray nozzles 
such that the area of coverage corresponds to the width of 
the web of material being utilized in the printing press. Lithography is the art or process of printing 
from a flat stone or metal plate. Lithography is 
distinguished from other forms of printing, in part, by 
the absence of the use of relief to distinguish between 
the areas to be printed and those to be left blank. The 
lithographic method is based upon the repulsion between 
immiscible liquids, such as oil-based inks, and water.  
 
The process begins by the etching of a design on a 
surface. A grease-like material that is attracted to the 
etched area is then applied to the surface and takes the 
form of the design. Water is then added to the surface. 
The greased areas repel the water which ensures that only 
the ungreased areas become water saturated. The printing 
ink subsequently applied will then be repelled by the 
ungreased water-saturated areas and absorbed by the 
greased areas. This creates the design in ink for 
transfer to a web. To encourage an even coating of water for 
printing, water is generally introduced to a dampener 
roller and subsequently transferred to the printing plate. 
Various methods for applying water to a dampener have been 
utilized in offset lithographic presses. One method 
typically utilizes a spray rail which comprises a series 
of spray nozzles that direct water onto the dampener. In order to properly saturate the dampener for 
adequate transfer of water to the printing plate, spray 
nozzles must span the width of the dampener. It is 
important that water is transferred to the printing plate 
over a large enough area to span the largest width web the 
printing press can handle. As a consequence, with fixed 
spray rails, when smaller widths of web are being utilized 
in printing, excess water is applied to the dampener and 
transferred to the press beyond the limits of the web. 
The excess water is not absorbed and has a tendency to 
flood the machinery.  
 As water is corrosive to some components of a 
printing press, this excess water can lead to premature 
corrosion, especially to the outer edges of the press
