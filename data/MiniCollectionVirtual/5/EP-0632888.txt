<ABSTRACT>
In a process for inspecting the surface and the forming of small objects, the objects are transferred from the upper surface of a rotary disk to the lower surface of another rotary disk, after their upper side has been inspected, are held there while their lower side is inspected, and are sorted when the inspection is finished. The axes of rotation of the rotary disks are arranged at such a distance from each other that partial areas of the circumference of the rotary disks (transfer areas) overlap. A gap-shaped intermediate shape is left between the upper side and the lower side of the rotary disks. Devices arranged in the transfer areas lift the objects to be inspected from the surface of one rotary disk and hold them on the lower side of the other rotary disk while their lower side is inspected.

Process for inspecting the surface of a plurality of small objects (items for examination) of 
essentially identical shape, in which the examination objects supplied in the form of a 

pourable material are distributed and positioned before they are moved by a disc rotating 
in a horizontal plane past a first inspection device for examination of their upper area, are 

subsequently received by a further rotatable disc and are moved by this for examination of 
their lower area past a second inspection device, said examination objects being retained 

on the discs at least for the duration of the respective inspections in order subsequently to 
be sorted in accordance with the inspection result, 
characterised in that
 the 
distribution and positioning of the examination objects in their inspection positions is 

performed by the indicated rotatable disc (distributor disc) with which the objects are

examination objects for inspection of their lower area (receiving disc) is rotated in a 
horizontal plane located a small distance above that of the distributor disc, and in the 

opposite rotational direction to that of said distributor disc, that the examination objects 
are transferred from the distributor disc to the receiving disc which, holding the 

examination objects at their already inspected upper face, passes by the second inspection 
device, with the distance between the vertical axes of rotation of the two discs being 

selected such that transfer of the examination objects from disc to disc is facilitated by an 
overlap of the peripheral regions of the two discs.

the examination objects past a first inspection device for inspection of their upper area, and 
with a second rotatable disc which serves to receive the examination objects from the first 

disc and to hold them at their inspected face in order to move the opposite surface past a 
second inspection device, with the two rotatable discs overlapping within a certain region 

while maintaining a gap-like intermediate space for transfer of the examination objects 
located on the first disc to the second disc, and further exhibiting devices which serve to 

retain on the discs the examination objects for the duration of the various inspections, 
and/or to detach the examination objects from the discs following completion of the 

inspection,
