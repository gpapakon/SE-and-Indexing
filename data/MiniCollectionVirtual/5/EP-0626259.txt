<ABSTRACT>
A printer system for printing a given pattern 
on a base board (P) is described which comprises a 

screen plate (1) to be positioned above the base 
board. The screen plate has a perforated print 

pattern defined thereby. A printer proper (A) is 
employed which includes an ink container chamber (5) 

and an ink squeezing device (2A;2B). The ink squeezing 
device runs on the screen plate pressing the same 

against the base board while squeezing a given 
amount of viscous ink onto an upper surface of 

the screen plate. A cleaning device is employed 
for cleaning residual of ink left on an lower 

surface of the screen plate and an ink supplier 
is employed for feeding the ink container chamber 

of the printer proper with a fresh viscous ink 
when needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
printer systems, and more particularly to printer
systems for printing electric circuit patterns on
an insulating base board. More specifically, the
present invention is concerned with printer
systems of a type which generally comprises a
printer device of so-called "screen print type"
which prints on an insulating base board an
electric circuit through a screen plate and a screen
plate cleaning device which cleans the screen
plate.Hitherto, various types of printer systems
have been proposed and put into practical use
particularly in the field of printed circuit
manufacture. Some of them are of a type which
employs a so-called "screen print type printer".
This type printer device comprises generally a
screen plate which is to be set on an insulating
base board to be printed, and an ink squeezing
device which runs on the screen plate while
squeezing a given amount of viscous conductive
ink onto the screen plate pressing the same
against the insulating base board. With this, on
the surface of the insulating base board, there
is printed a desired circuit pattern of the
conductive ink, which coincides with a perforated
print pattern formed in the screen plate. The
base board is then heated for fixing the printed
circuit pattern. The screen plate is usually
constructed of a stainless steel, silk or the
like. For clarifying the present invention, some of
conventional printer systems using the screen
print type printer device will be described in
brief.A printer system having the features of the preamble of claim 1
is known from JP-4242993. US-A-5 287 806 discloses a printer
system having a cleaning device to clean the lower surface of
the screen plate.Japanese Patent Application 2-419135 shows an
ink squeezing device usable in such printer
devices. The ink squeezing device comprises
generally a pair (viz., front and rear) of metal
blades which have lower ends contactable with an
upper surface of the screen plate, an ink
container housing which is located between the
paired blades and has an ink outlet opening
through which a viscous conductive ink in the
housing is squeezed toward the blades, and a
shutter mechanism which opens the ink outlet
opening when printing is needed and closes the
opening when not needed. Only when the ink
container housing is advanced for carrying out
printing, the lower ends of the paired blades are
brought into contact with the upper surface of
the screen plate and one of the blades, which is
the trailing one, serves as a squeezing
