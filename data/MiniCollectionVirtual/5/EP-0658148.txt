<ABSTRACT>
A wallet style compact disc storage unit (10) includes an enclosing case (12) and an interior structure (14) adapted to releasably hold a plurality of compact discs (16). The enclosing case (12) includes a clamshell structure including a first shell member (22) and a second shell member (24), each having corresponding cushions (40, 42), are connected by a living hinge (26) and releasably secured by a slide latch (28). The interior structure (14) includes an even plurality of disc receiving plates (56) formed in four plate modules (58) with each plate (56) being adapted to support one of the compact discs (16) in a releasable manner. Adjacent pairs of plates (56) are hingedly connected by alternating first hinges (104) and second hinges (106) to require accordion type folding of the respective plates (56). Pretensioning of the interior structure (14) and alternating opposingly biased hinge structures cause the plates (56) to process with a distinctive "flipping" motion to conveniently present the discs (6) to the user for viewing and removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to storage 
modules providing protection for and access to generally 
planar items and more particularly to storage units for 
enclosing and displaying compact discs. The preferred 
embodiment of the present invention is particularly adapted 
to be an easily transportable carrying case for compact 
discs, separate from their associated jewel boxes. One of the most popular forms of recording information 
in general and musical recordings in particular is 
the compact disc. This type of storage medium utilizes laser-based 
inscription and reading technology to store a vast 
amount of information on a relatively small item. A standard 
twelve centimeter diameter compact disc will easily hold the 
contents of a standard record album or, for data contents, as 
much as an entire set of encyclopedias. With the proliferation of the compact disc ("CD") as a 
means of recording information has come a need for storage of 
a multitude of the discs. Typically, since the discs are 
commercially recorded and are not alterable by the user, it 
is necessary to maintain a library of the discs which one 
wishes to utilize. Storage of the individual discs in the 
library is an important consideration. Typically, compact discs are contained within an 
associated jewel box when purchased by the customer. Many 
methods of storage have retained the CD within the jewel box 
for storage. One such example is shown and described in the 
Applicants' own prior patent No. 4,900,107, for a spring 
loaded individually slotted storage structure which was 
particularly adapted to receive items such as compact disc 
jewel boxes and audio cassette boxes.  
 However, the jewel box is far more bulky than the CD 
itself. Since the CD is a thin disc which is relatively 
resistant to damage, it is desirable and feasible to minimize 
space consumption, particularly for portable circumstances, 
by storing the disc by itself, without the associated jewel 
box. Various attempts have been made in the past to provide 
such storage methods. One such storage is described and shown in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,762,225, issued to Walter R. Henkel. The Henkel patent 
utilizes a series of pockets or sleeves which are connected 
end to end and each is adapted to retain a single compact 
disc therein. In the method of Henkel, a variety of CDs, 
outside of the associated boxes, can be stored and provide for display and access in a relatively compact manner. A storage unit according to the preamble of Claim 1 is 
disclosed in

<CLAIMS>
A storage unit (10) for enclosing and accessibly 
presenting a plurality of generally flat items (16), the 

unit (10) comprising a housing (12) having two portions 
(22,24) which can be readily opened to allow access to the 

flat items (16) situated therein and to be closed to 
isolate and protect the flat items (16); a plurality of 

generally rigid flat item holding plates (56), each 
holding plate (56) having a front face (60), a rear face 

(68) and being of a predetermined thickness at least in 
the region of its periphery, characterised in that the 

plates (56) are hingedly connected to one another in 
series to allow the series of plates (56) to be folded in 

concertina-like fashion, in that the two housing portions 
(22,24) are hingedly interconnected and in that the plates 

(56) at opposite ends of the series are hingedly connected 
to respective housing portions (22,24) in such positions 

that when the housing (12) is opened, the two end holding 
plates (56) are moved into spaced apart relationship in 

the same general plane and two adjacent plates (56) 
between the end holding plates (56) flip into a position 

bridging the space between the end holding plates (56). 
A unit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that each plate (56) has a first hinged fulcrum (104) 

aligned with the front face (60), and a second hinged 
fulcrum (106) aligned with the rear face (68). 
A unit according to Claim 1 or to Claim 2, 
wherein the holding plates (56) are interconnected by 

hinge structures (104,106), each of said hinged structures 

(104,106) permitting only limited rotation thereabout by 
the associated plate (56). 
A unit according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that each alternate hinge structure (104) in the series of 

plates (56) preferentially urges rotation thereabout so as 
to bring the adjacent front faces (60) of adjacent plates  

 
(56) into planar abutment with one another and each 

intervening hinge structure (106) preferentially urges 
rotation thereabout so as to bring the adjacent rear faces 

(68) of adjacent plates into planar abutment with one 
another. 
A unit according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that each said hinge structure (104,106) 

includes a pair of opposed first hinge arms and second 
hinge arms, each hinge 

arm being tapered from relatively thick where it adjoins 
the plate (56) to relatively thin where it becomes the 

fulcrum. 
A unit according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that each said plate (56) is in the form 

of a thin rectangular solid having a cutout portion (64) 
on the front face (60) in the shape of the outline of the 

said item (16). 
A unit according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the housing portions (22,24) may be 

relatively rotated approximately through 180 degrees about 
the hinge (26) from a closed position to a maximum opened 

position. 
A unit according to Claim 7,characterised in 
that each of the housing portions (22,24) includes a 

cushion member (40,42) adapted to mate therewith to 
provide an exterior cushion adapted to prevent deformation 

of said housing portions (22,24) or damage to the items 
(16) in the event of impact. 
A unit according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that each holding plate (56) carries a 

hub opening pedestal (62) adapted to engage a hub opening 
in the item (16). 
A unit according to Claim 7 or to Claim 8, 
characterised by latch means (28) are provided on the 

extents of housing portions (22,24) opposite the hinge  
 

(26), the latch means (8) securing said housing (12) in a 
closed orientation until released to permit rotation about 

the hinge to an opened orientation. 
A unit according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that said cutout portion (64) is generally in the shape of 

the outline of an item (16), the cutout portion (64) being 
deep enough so that an item (16) retained therein will not 

abut directly against an item (16) retained in a 
corresponding cutout portion on a facing adjacent holding 

plate (56). 
A unit according to any preceding claim, said 
plurality of holding plates (56) is in the form of 

identical four plate modules, hingedly connected end to 
end such that the interface between adjacent four plate 

modules is functionally indistinguishable from the hinged 
connection between intermediate plate members within one 

of the four plate modules.
