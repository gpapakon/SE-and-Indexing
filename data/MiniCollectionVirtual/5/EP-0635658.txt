<ABSTRACT>
For adaptation to different loads, the gearing, which is preferably provided for use in battery-operated electric drills or electric screwdrivers, has an overload clutch for torque limitation. The overload clutch consists essentially of an internal gear (3) which is arranged around a planetary gearing, is formed from plastic and is provided with internal toothing which is in engagement with the planetary gearing. A spring device (18) presses on the internal gear in order to press it axially against a stop wall (12), with the result that the hollow gear is held fixed against rotation by frictional engagement until a predetermined torque loading is reached, the internal gear being free to rotate when the predetermined torque loading is exceeded. For this purpose, a metallic cam disc (5) is arranged between the plastic internal gear and the spring device, this cam disc being connected in a fixed manner in terms of rotation to the internal gear.

<CLAIMS>
Gear unit having the features:

a gear unit housing (4);
a planetary gear unit (1, 2, 8, 9) disposed inside
the gear unit housing (4) for altering the rotary

speed from a drive shaft (23) to an output shaft
(24) ;
an overload clutch having

an annular gear which surrounds the planetary
gear unit (1, 2, 3, 8, 9) and which has

internal teeth which are in engagement with the
planetary gear unit,
a spring device (18) which presses on the
annular gear (3) in order to press the annular

gear (3) so long axially against a detente wall
(12) that the annular gear (3) is prevented

from rotation by friction locking until a
predetermined torque loading has been reached

and, when the predetermined torque loading is
exceeded, the annular gear (3) is released for

rotation,
a pressure ring (6) which is disposed radially
in a fixed manner and which is disposed between

annular gear (3) and compression spring (18),

characterized by the features:

the annular gear (3) is composed of plastics
material,
a guard plate (5) which is disposed between annular
gear (3) and compression spring (18),
the guard plate (5) is joined in a rotationally
secured manner to the annular gear (3) and is

composed of a material having a greater mechanical
strength than the annular gear (3), 
the guard plate (5) and the pressure ring (6) are
provided with keying elements (30, 31) on oppositely

situated surfaces and are planarly in contact with
one another for a transmission of motion up to a

predetermined torque loading.
Gear unit according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the guard plate (5) is detachably seated on the

annular gear (3).
Gear unit according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the annular gear (3) is provided on its face side

with recesses (27) and the guard plate (5) is provided
with projections (28) and the projections (28) of the

guard plate (5) are disposed in a non-slipping manner in
the recesses (27) of
 the annular gear (3) in the
direction of rotation.
Gear unit according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the plastics material of which the

annular gear (3) is composed is an injection-mouldable
thermoplastic material, preferably nylon 66 having a

mineral filling.
Gear unit according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the keying elements (30, 31) on the

pressure ring (6) and the guard plate (5) are annularly
distributed protuberances.
Gear unit according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the guard plate (5) is a metallic

cam disc.
Gear unit according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the metallic cam disc (5) is composed of a deep-drawable

and stampable metal. 
Gear unit according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that the cam disc (5) is a stamped part.
Use of the gear unit according to one of Claims 1 to
8 in a storage-battery-driven electrical tool, in

particular in a drill or screw-driver tool.
