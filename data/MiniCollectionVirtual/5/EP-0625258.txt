<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frangible 
practice ammunition or bullet for use in shooting 
galleries and the like, and to a manufacturing method 
for such a bullet. Lead gallery bullets are well known; they are 
characterized by the use of powders of lead consolidated 
into a bullet having sufficient strength for use and 
intended to be disrupted into small fragments on impact 
with a gallery target. The costs associated with the training of users 
of such ammunitions are extremely high. First, in a 
shooting gallery, an expensive device, called "bullet 
trap", is required to stop the projectile to prevent 
fragments from injuring shooters. Furthermore, the walls 
of the shooting galleries must be covered with "ballistic 
rubber" in order to stop occasional fragments of the 
projectile. There is also lead contamination which bears a 
heavy burden in the cost associated with training with 
standard ammunitions. During a shooting session, there 
is an emission of lead dust into the atmosphere. Also, 
the accumulation of projectiles in shooting galleries 
causes an environmental problem. Many shooting galleries  
 
have been closed recently due to the high level of lead 
in these installations. The problem is replacing lead for the purpose 
of a gallery shooting round is to find a materiel 
sufficiently heavy that the automatic weapons will be 
able to cycle and the shooter will see few differences. 
Costly, abrasive or toxic heavy metals should be avoided 
while a cheap production process is required to keep 
production costs low. The main criteria for the ability of a round to 
cycle autoloader weapons is the amount of energy that it 
delivers to the cycling mechanism. For some type of 
weapons, this energy is delivered by the expanding gases 
pushing back the cartridge case. This type may be found 
with the 9 mm Browning Hi-Power pistol for example. For 
some others, high pressure gases are connected through a 
port pressure inside the barrel. The high pressured 
gases are then the source of energy for the cycling 
mechanism. This type is found in most 5.56 NATO 
nominated weapons, like the Colt M16. Weapons and propellant powders are designed to 
work with a projectile of a certain mass that gives a 
typical pressure-vs-time curve. Using a lighter 
projectile will cause problems, the main one being too 
low an energy transfer to give the feeding mechanism the 
needed momentum to cycle, in certain type of weapons.  
 In order to replace lead in a projectile, the 
selected material should have a

<CLAIMS>
A frangible practice ammunition consisting essentially 
of a compacted mixture of fine copper powder and of a 

thermoplastic resin selected from the group consisting of 
nylon 11 and nylon 12; said copper powder being from 92 % to 

95 % by weight of the mixture, said mixture having a minimum 
specific gravity of 5.7. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in claim 
1, wherein said mixture is an injection molded compacted 

material. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in claim 
1, wherein said copper powder consists of particles having 

a spheroidal shape. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in claim 
3, wherein a major portion of said particles have a size 

finer than 44 µm. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in claim 
1, wherein said resin is in the shape of fine powder having 

a size of less than 80 µm.  
 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in 
claim 1, wherein said fine copper powder is about 92.5 - 

93.5% by weight. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in 
claim 6, wherein said thermoplastic resin is about 6.5 - 

7.5% by weight. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in 
claim 1, further comprising a lubricant. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in 
claim 1, further comprising a wetting agent. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in 
claim 1, wherein said mixture has a weight of up to 36 

grains or 2,33 g for a 5.56 mm calibre. 
A frangible practice ammunition as defined in 
claim 1, wherein said mixture has a weight of up to 85 

grains or 5,5 g for a 9 mm calibre.  
 
A method of manufacturing a frangible practice 
ammunition according to claim 1, comprising the steps of: 


(a) dry blending or tumbling a mix of solid particles of 
raw materials consisting of from 92 to 95% wt of ultra-fine 

copper powder, nylon 11 or 12 and a wetting agent or 
lubricant, 
(b) thermally blending said solid particles into a 
uniform homogeneous mass, 
(c) screw extruding said mass at temperatures sufficient 
to adhesively bonding the nylon to the solid copper particles 

to form a composite, 
(d) finely dividing the composite and classifying in 
particle size according to a predetermined pattern, and 
(e) injection molding the classified particles into 
bullets.
