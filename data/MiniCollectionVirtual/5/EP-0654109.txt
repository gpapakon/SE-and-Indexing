<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the building industry and more particularly to a metal ribbed formwork (1) having a cross-section with polygonal ribs, which is further provided with local inset deformations (7) formed in the edges (2, 3) of the ribs, said deformations forming series of narrowings of the lands (4, 5) which are anchored in the concrete. The invention also relates to a machine for fabricating such sectional elements. The formwork according to the invention is intended to the construction of high span collaborating floors.

<CLAIMS>
Ribbed metal floor deck (1) for the construction of
steel/concrete (10) composite slabs having a cross-section with

polygonal ribs, characterized in that it possesses localised,
reentrant, non-stripping deformations (7), formed in the arrises (2,

9) of the ribs, that is to say said decks being anchored in the
concrete (10) in such a way that they can not move from the concrete

(10) without being deformed or breaking the concrete (10).
Floor deck (1) according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the deformations (7) are simultaneously arranged along the two facing

arrises (2, 3) bounding the same flange (4, 5).
Floor deck (1) according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the deformations (7) along two facing arrises (2, 3) are staggered.
Floor deck (1) according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the deformations (7) render it non-stripping.
Floor deck (1) according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the deformations (7) have depths

progressively increasing from their edges as far as their middle.
Floor deck (1) according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it furthermore includes at least one

means of the following group, these means being taken separately or
in combination:

   transverse bulging of the flanges of the floor deck

   transverse or oblique ribbing

   embossments

   lanced bosses

   longitudinal ribbing

   web stiffeners. 
Floor deck (1) according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is associated with hanging means of

the type comprising a plate (16) or a clamp (18) which are fixed to
the deformations (7).
Floor deck (1) according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it uses the embossing of the metal

without, or virtually without, elongation of the metal transversely
to the sheeting.
