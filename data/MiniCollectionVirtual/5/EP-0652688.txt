<ABSTRACT>
In a method of matching the heating power of a vitroceramic hob to the characteristics required for cooking food, it being provided to control the temperature of the pot, at the start of the parboil operation the parboil heating power of an electric hob is set to a selectable, constant value. The temperature of the bottom of the pot is then continuously measured at equal time intervals, the curve of the slope of the temperature of the pot bottom is determined over time and the actual slope value of the temperature of the pot is compared with a desired slope value and the heating power is switched over in the event of deviations. In this process, it is provided for one programme to be selected initially from a predetermined cooking, simmering, steaming (stewing), melting or roasting programme, there being contained in this programme as characteristic parameters the maximum temperature, the heating-up rate and the temperature lowering  DELTA T after reaching the maximum temperature, and for control then to be carried out continuously and for the heating-up power to be reduced by the programme even before the maximum temperature is reached.

Method of setting the heating power supplied to a ceramic hob, in particular a
glass ceramic hob, to the heating power necessary for food preparation, wherein


a) during a parboiling process the heating power of the hob is set to a parboiling

power,
b) the temperature of the hob is measured continually, preferably at equal intervals,
and the value of the rise in temperature over time is determined,
c) the temperature rise determined is compared to a temperature rise limit value, and
d) if the temperature rise is not short of the limit value, the heating power is kept at
the parboiling heating power or
e) if the rise in temperature is short of the limit value, the corresponding value of the
measured temperature is stored as a standard temperature and
f) from the stored standard temperature a reference temperature is calculated, which
is lower than the standard temperature, and
g) the temperature of the hob is regulated following the parboiling process during a
continuing cooking process by setting the heating power to the calculated

reference temperature.
Method according to claim 1, wherein a programme is selectable from a plurality
of specified cooking programmes, in particular a boiling, steaming, melting or

frying programme, and each programme comprises an associated temperature
reduction for calculating the reference temperature for the continuing cooking

process from the standard temperature.
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the content, empty or full, of a
pan on the hob is recognised in that the time curve of the temperature rise is

monitored during the parboiling process and if a preselected curve is exceeded,
the supply or heating power is interrupted. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein by means of a
capacitance measurement with electrically symmetrical electrodes, the pan size is

established and if a pan is placed in the wrong position, the heating power supply
is interrupted.
Method according to claim 4, wherein the pan position is determined relative to
the position in the case of optimum symmetry by capacitive measurements against

an earthed neutral conductor.
Method according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the pan size is determined via a
capacitance measurements of concentrically arranged segments against one

another and/or against an earthed neutral conductor.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the temperature of the
hob is determined by means of a temperature-dependent electrical resistance of an

electrical conductor.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the temperature of the
hob is determined by measuring the resistance of the ceramic, in particular glass

ceramic, between two electrodes.
Method according to claim 7 and 8, wherein an optical signal is effected if the
temperature determined by the electrical conductor is higher than the temperature

determined in the ceramic, in particular glass ceramic, by an amount which
exceeds a specified minimum value,
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein during the continuing
cooking process, pans which boil dry during the continued cooking process due to 

the heat output which drops below a specified power at the same temperature are
recognised and then the heating power supply is interrupted.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein temperature regulation
is carried out continuously during the continuing cooking process.
