<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control device for a 
vehicle antitheft system, particularly for cars featuring an 
electronic engine control system. Systems of the aforementioned type currently installed on 
motor vehicles are known to comprise an electronic control system 
for enabling operation of the engine on receiving a user code; an 
anti theft device for receiving the user code and transmitting it to 
the control system; and a user code transmitter carried by the user. 
Failing reception of the correct user code, the control system 
prevents the engine from being started. An example of the aforementioned vehicle anti theft system is 
described in the France patent application FR 2592347. The vehicle 
anti theft system described in FR 2592347 comprises a user code 
transmitter carried by the user and a keyboard placed inside the 
vehicle for transmitting the user code to the vehicle antitheft 
system in case of fault of the user code transmitter. A major drawback of the above system is the difficulty 
encountered by the control system manufacturer in effecting checks 
and measurements of the control system for lack of the user code.  
 A solution for correcting the above mentioned drawback has 
already been proposed in the PCT patent application WO 8806110. The 
generic anti-theft vehicle system described in WO 8806110 comprises a 
keyboard placed inside the vehicle for transmitting the user code to 
the vehicle anti theft system. Moreover, the keyboard comprises a key 
for enabling a "service mode" to enable the vehicle to be used by 
other people whilst being serviced or driven in a car park without 
those people having to know the driver's input code. Whether the 
engine is already enabled (that is the user code is already 
transmitted by the driver) and the service mode key is depressed, 
the anti-theft vehicle system is disabled until another key in the 
keyboard is depressed. When the anti-theft vehicle system is 
disabled, the engine can be start only using the ignition key. The system proposed by the PCT patent application WO 8806110 
does not allow the control system manufacturer to do checks and 
measurements of all the features of the control system for lack of 
the user code, for example the control system manufacturer can not 
check the enabling/disabling process of the engine without the user 
code. It is an object of the present invention to provide a control 
device for a vehicle antitheft system, enabling startup of the 
engine by the control system manufacturer even without
