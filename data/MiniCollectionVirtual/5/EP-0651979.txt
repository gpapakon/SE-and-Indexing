<ABSTRACT>
A cam-locking orthopaedic fixation device for anchoring a bone 
graft in a bore formed in a bone mass. The device has a head, a 

nose remote from the head, and a body, extending between the 
head and the nose, with a series of threaded crests only partially 

circumferentially surrounding the body. At least one side of the 
body is smooth and free of thread crests.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to orthopedic 
fixation screws and methods and more particularly to 
such screws and methods in which a bone graft is 
anchored in a bore formed in a bone mass. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is 25mm-40mm 
in length and is frequently injured in contact and 
other activities. Such injuries can cause instability 
in the knee to the extent that ACL reconstruction may 
be required. The replacement of the ACL with the central third 
of the patellar tendon using a bone-tendon-bone graft 
is a known method for restoring knee stability. In 
this procedure, the central third of the patellar 
tendon and portions of bone at either end thereof are 
taken as a graft. A tunnel is bored in the distal 
femur and proximal tibia, i.e., where they join at the 
knee. The bone-tendon-bone graft is disposed with one 
bone segment in one of the tunnels and the other bone 
segment in the other tunnel. With the graft so 
disposed, each of the bone segments are anchored by 
screwing an interference screw into the tunnel between 
a tunnel wall and the bone segment thereby anchoring 
the segment in the tunnel. Such procedure is illustrated and described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,927,421 to Goble et al. for process  
 
of endosteal fixation of a ligament. The Goble et al. 
method suffers from several disadvantages. First, the 
interference screw is cannulated, i.e., it has an axial 
bore for riding a guide wire into the bore. The wire 
must be inserted into the bore adjacent the bone graft 
before the screw can be installed. The guide wire 
prevents divergence of the screw as it is screwed into 
the space between the graft and the tunnel wall. A 
special driver, also having an axial bore for receiving 
the guide wire, must be provided to install the screw. 
Threading the wire through the bore is an additional 
surgical step, in itself undesirable, which has the 
potential for creating metal debris. In addition, the 
guide wires can bend or kink. The screw of the 
Goble et al. application provides an extremely steep 
taper at the leading end thereof which rapidly 
compresses the graft as the screw is installed. The present invention comprises a cam-locking 
orthopedic fixation screw for anchoring a bone graft in 
a bore formed in a bone mass. The screw includes a 
head, a nose remote from the head, and a body having 
continuously tapered threads tapering from the head of 
the screw to the nose of the screw wherein one side of 
the screw, along the longitudinal axis is flat and 
unthreaded. In
