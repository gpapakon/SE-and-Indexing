<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver
halide photographic material. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a silver halide photographic
material which exhibits little sensitivity
change during storage before use, rapid processability
and a high spectral sensitizability.A technique has been heretofore known which
comprises incorporating a sensitizing dye into a silver
halide emulsion during the preparation of a silver
halide light-sensitive material so that the light-sensitive
wavelength range of the silver halide emulsion
is widened to effect optical sensitization.As the spectral sensitizing dyes to be used for
this purpose there have heretofore been known many
compounds. Examples of such spectral sensitizing dyes
include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes and xanthene dyes 
as described in T.H. James, The Theory of the
Photographic Process, 3rd ed., 1966, Macmillan, N.Y.,
pp. 198 - 228.When used in place of an ordinary silver halide
emulsion, these silver halide emulsions must not only
widen the light-sensitive range of the silver halide
emulsion but also meet the following requirements:
(1) a proper spectral sensitizing range must be
given;(2) a high sensitizing efficiency must be given
to obtain a sufficiently high sensitivity;(3) no fogging occurs;(4) a small dispersion of sensitivity due to
temperature fluctuation upon exposure;(5) no advese interactions with other kinds of
additives, e.g., stabilizer, fog inhibitor, coating aid,
color developer;(6) no sensitivity fluctuation upon storage of a
silver halide emulsion containing a sensitizing dye,
especially at an elevated temperature and a high
humidity; and(7) no sensitizing dyes are diffused into the
other light-sensitive layers to inhibit color stain
after development.These requirements are important particularly
when a silver halide emulsion for silver halide color
photographic material is prepared.However, despite many attempts, it is not easy
to inhibit the sensitivity drop after the storage of
unprocessed specimens to a sufficient extent. In
particular, when a polymethylene dye having an oxidation
potential of 0.60 or lower (V vs SCE) is used as a
sensitizing dye, the sensitivity drop after the storage
of the unprocessed specimens becomes great, making it
difficult to obtain sufficient properties.A methine dye containing as a substituent a
saturated or unsaturated 5- to 7-membered ring including
at least one nitrogen atom is reported in European
Patent Application Disclosure (EP) 0372573. However,
this nitrogen-containing 5- to
