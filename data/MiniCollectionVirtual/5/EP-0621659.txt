<ABSTRACT>
An automatic switched power receptacle (10) 
includes an outlet receptacle (12) adapted to receive a 

plug P. A relay (30) is connected between the power 
receptacle (12) and a source (35) of power to selectively 

power the receptacle (12). A plug presence sensor (28) in 
proximity to the receptacle (12) senses presence of a plug 

P in the receptacle (12). The plug presence sensor (28) 
comprises a light source (36) and light sensor (38), the 

light source (36) and light sensor (38) being disposed on 
opposite sides of a path (48) of movement of a plug P being 

inserted in the receptacle (12). An automatic control 
circuit (18) is connected between the relay (30) and the 

plug presence sensor (28) for selectively energizing the 
relay (30) to power the receptacle (12) incident to the 

sensor (28) sensing presence of a plug P.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control for an 
automatic power receptacle and, more particularly, to use 
of hysteresis in such a control. In providing electrical circuits to a facility, 
such as a home, one or more branch circuits are wired to 
distribute electrical power to load devices, such as outlet 
receptacles or light fixtures. Typically, the receptacle 
or fixture is hardwired directly to the branch circuit, 
with power to the device being turned on or off at the 
device itself. For example, a light fixture might include 
a pull cord for actuating a switch, while a small appliance 
might include a power switch. With recent technological developments it is both 
possible and advantageous to provide automated control of 
load devices to provide, for example, remote or timed 
switching. One such system directs all communication 
functions into a system controller. This gives a home 
owner flexible communication and power control from 
anywhere in the home there is a control panel or switch, or 
even anywhere there is a telephone, such as the car or 
office. An intelligent outlet receptacle allows individual 
appliances to be separately and automatically controlled as  
 
necessary or desired. To do so, some means must be 
provided for controlling switching of power to an 
electrical outlet receptacle. A practical switching device 
must be inexpensive and reliable. A latching relay has 
been found to be readily adaptable to such an application. 
A latching relay is latched when connected to a positive 
polarity voltage source and unlatched when connected to a 
negative polarity voltage source. Some applications require that electrical power 
be applied to an outlet receptacle only when in use. 
Particularly, the outlet receptacle is disconnected from 
the power source when no plug is present and disconnected 
to the power source when a plug is inserted in the 
receptacle. In combination with the above-described 
features, such a control circuit enables a particular 
outlet receptacle to be controlled both in response to 
presence or absence of a plug and demands of external user 
or automatic control functions. An automatic control such as described requires 
that insertion of a plug be detected and an electronic 
signal be delivered to a control to indicate presence or 
absence of the plug. While inserting or removing the plug, 
it is possible that the sensing system could cycle, 
resulting in relay "chatter". Obviously, it is desirable 
to prevent relay chatter. Document EP-A-0 409 226 discloses an
