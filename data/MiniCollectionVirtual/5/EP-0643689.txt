<DESCRIPTION>
(4R-Cis)-1,1-dimethylethyl 6-(2-aminoethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-acetate
is a key intermediate in
the preparation of (2R-trans) -5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(1-methylethyl)-N,4-diphenyl]-1-[2-(tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2H-pyran-2-yl)ethyl]-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide
or
the salt of the hydroxy acid, [R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-β,
δ-dihydroxy-5-1-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-1H-pyrrole-1-heptanoic
acid calcium salt (2:1), corresponding to
the opened lactone ring of the aforementioned compound
described in United States Patents 4,647,576 and
4,681,893, which are herein incorporated by reference.
The aforementioned compound is useful as an inhibitor
of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A
reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) and is thus useful as a
hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic agent.(4R-Cis)-1,1-dimethylethyl 6-(2-aminoethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4-acetate
may be, in turn,
prepared from (4R-Cis)-1,1-dimethylethyl 6-cyanomethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4-acetate
which
may, in turn, be prepared from (5R)-1,1-dimethylethyl
6-cyano-5-hydroxy-3-oxo-hexanoate.A synthetic procedure for preparing (5R)-1,1-dimethylethyl
6-cyano-5-hydroxy-3-oxo-hexanoate is
disclosed in United States Patent 5,003,080. The
aforementioned procedure involves a linear synthetic
route involving 5 steps, involving use of protected
intermediates. Although this procedure provides the
target compound it is difficult to conduct on large
scale, requires use of expensive starting materials, 
and involves the use of costly protecting group and
deprotecting group reagents in the process.There are several literature reports in which the
anion of tertiary butyl acetate is reacted with a
3-hydroxy ester in the desired manner to afford a
β-keto-δ ester, for example, Lynch, J. E., et al,
Tetrahedron Letters, Volume 23, pages 1385-1388 (1987)
and United States Patent 4,970,313. However, none of
the known examples contain a nitrile group. Moreover,
United States Patent 4,983,759 discloses the reaction
of a nitrile with the anion of tertiary butyl acetate
resulting in reaction at the nitrile end of the
molecule.Thus, we have surprisingly and unexpectedly found
that the reaction of the anion of tertiary butyl
acetate with (3R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid esters
proceeds very efficiently to afford the desired
compound, (5R)-1,1-dimethylethyl 6-cyano-5-hydroxy-3-oxo-hexanoate.The object of the present invention is an
improved, short, efficient, and economical process for
the preparation of (5R)-1,1-dimethylethyl
