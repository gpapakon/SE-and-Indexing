<ABSTRACT>
1. Device (1) for receiving coins on a coin-operated machine. 2.1 Coin-operated machines have, for receiving the coinage, a coin-insertion slot (4), in which the individual coins have to be introduced in succession by the user. The device (1) for receiving coins is now to be designed in such a way that it receives the entire mixed coinage and automatically feeds it individually to the coin tester (8) in succession. 2.2 To achieve an automatic continuous coin flow to the coin tester (8), there is provided a continuous conveyor (2) with a coin-collecting space, in which the coins to be fed individually and to the coin tester (5) can be introduced as mixed coinage.

Device (1) for receiving coins in a coin-operated 
machine, having a coin-introduction slot (4) on a front 

plate, the coin-introduction slot being adjoined, on the 
rear side of the front plate, by a coin duct (7) which 

leads to a coin-receiving location of a coin tester, 
characterized in that there is provided adjacent to the 

coin-introduction slot (4) an opening (5) for the purpose 
of feeding mixed coins to a coin-collecting area of a 

continuous conveyor (2), by means of which separated 
coins can be directed to the coin tester by way of the 

coin duct (7). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, as conveying means, the continuous conveyor (2) 

comprises a hollow cylinder (13) which has carry-along 
ribs (25) which are arranged parallel to one another on 

the inner circumference of said cylinder and are 
inclined, in the direction of a coin-output opening (20), 

into the housing rear-wall part (11) of the continuous 
conveyor (2). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that, in the region of the coin-feed side of the 

continuous conveyor (2), the hollow cylinder (13) has 
coin-deflecting protrusions (26) on the inner 

circumference. 
Device according to Claim 2 and/or 3, characterized 
in that that end side of the hollow cylinder (13) 

which is directed towards the housing rear-wall part (11) 
has a toothing arrangement (18) in which a drive pinion 

(17) of a drive motor (12) meshes.  
 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the housing rear-wall part (11) has extensions (14) 

which are directed towards the housing front part (3) and 
engage over the hollow cylinder (13) in the axial 

direction, and in that a receiving means for the drive 
motor (12) of the hollow cylinder (13) is provided on 

that side wall of the housing rear-wall part (11) which 
is located opposite the extensions (14). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the housing rear-wall part (11) has an aperture (24) 

which is located in the region of the extensions (14) and 
through which the drive pinion (17) passes to some 

extent. 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that the hollow cylinder (13) is 

supported, on the one hand, on an inner circumference of 
an annular rib (21) of the housing front part (3) and, on 

the other hand, on an outer circumference of an annular 
rib (22) of the housing rear-wall part (11). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that there is provided in the housing 

rear-wall part (11) a coin-output opening (20) which is 
assigned to the inner circumference of the hollow 

cylinder (13) and is arranged approximately symmetrically 
with respect to the horizontal axis of rotation of the 

hollow cylinder (13). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that the wall reg
ion (19), which can be 
covered with the hollow cylinder (13), of the housing 

rear-wall part (11) is of frustoconical design. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the coin duct (7), leading from the coin-introduction 

slot (4) and from the coin-output opening 
(20) to the coin tester, is assigned at least one sensor 

which is intended for detecting the through-passage of 
coins and is connected to a control unit which activates 

the drive motor (12), it being possible for the latter to 
be brought to a standstill for a predeterminable, 

adjustable time interval after each through-passage  
 

operation. 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 
10, characterized in that it is possible to detect, using 

at least one sensor, whether coins are present in the 
hollow cylinder (13). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that, with a supply of coins in the hollow cylinder (13), 

the control unit supplies the drive motor (12) with power 
until a predeterminable time interval has elapsed. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, having a coin unit from which coins can be paid 

out, characterized in that a coin duct leads from a coin-output 
location of the coin unit to a further continuous 

conveyor. 
Device according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the coin-output location is adjoined by a coin-directing 

device which leads to the further continuous 
conveyor, and in that the further continuous conveyor can 

route the paid-out coins from the coin unit to the hollow 
cylinder (13), which is located above the coin-output 

location.
