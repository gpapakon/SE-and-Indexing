<ABSTRACT>
There is described a combination of a thin upper honeycomb core (3) 
plus a lower honeycomb 

core (5) of equal or lower density than the upper core which are 
united by only a thin light 

weight interlayer (4) within two outer skins provides a low weight 
hybrid panel with 

increased durability when the upper surface (1) is subjected to 
localized compressive loads.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a low weight panel with increased durability when the upper 
surface is subjected to localized compressive loads. Current sandwich structures used for aircraft flooring use only a single density honeycomb 
core in this construction. Heavy traffic on such flooring frequently causes failure or 
damage to the upper surface requiring that the flooring be replaced at great cost and 
inconvenience. In order to increase the durability of such flooring panels and to increase their resistance to 
concentrated transverse compressive loads, either more skin material or higher honeycomb 
core densities or both must be used. Both of these remedies are basically unacceptable 
since they each substantially increase the panel weight. This is an unacceptable solution 
for aircraft structures where a minimum weight is always desired. Many attempts to solve the problems stated above have been made. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,937,125 describes one approach where a multilayer sandwich structure having a 
core interposed between and external and internal skin. The upper skin is a composite 
layer-polyester layer-honeycomb layer-metal sheet-glass fiber reinforced epoxy 
layer-composite layer. The core is a honeycomb. The internal skin is a metal sheet or a 
skin of the same composition as the external skin. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,336,292; 5,041,323 and 5,106,668 describe multi-layered panels 
comprised substantially of two or several subpanels - one possibly with a higher density 
core than the other(s) - bonded together to form a complete panel. The latter example 
would work successfully, but, because of the method and materials of construction, 
additional materials over and above those of the instant invention are required resulting in 
a panel which is too costly and substantially overweight for aerospace applications.  In the present invention, two cores of either the same or different densities and/or cell 
sizes are combined by means of a light weight septum to form a hybrid core. The septum 
material is not of the same material as the outer skins of the sandwich panel and serves as 
a means to transfer load between the upper and lower portions of the structure. There is no 
requirement that the two honeycomb cores be aligned. That the septum prevents relative 
movement between the two cores is necessary, but not sufficient. The septum must be 
both sufficiently stiff and strong to redistribute localized compressive loads as well as 
being sufficiently light in weight to provide panels which can meet
