<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for direct production of photopolymeric 
printing plates. The method comprises forming a positive and/or negative 

image on a substrate by ink-jet printing with a photopolymeric ink 
composition, optionally preheated. The apparatus (1) for carrying out the 

method of the invention comprises a rotatable drum (2) adapted for retaining 

on its inner or outer surface the substrate (4) to be printed; a carriage (5), 
displaceable axially in respect of the drum (2); a container (8) for a photo-polymeric 

ink composition; at least one nozzle (6) communicating with the 
carriage (5) for ejecting the photopolymeric ink composition; and a UV 

source (10) located so as to expose the printed surface of the substrate (4) 
to UV radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method and apparatus for direct 
production of photopolymeric printing plates by ink-jet printing techniques. Recent years have seen an overwhelming development in the 
printers' art. The use of computers has provided increased speed and 
precision for production, control and scheduling. The progress in printing, 
such as the use of a scanner which directly "reads" picture images, created 
the necessity for direct plate-making. One of the methods for direct plate-making uses ink-jet printing 
to directly form an image or "non-image" portion. Ink-jet printing is a 
pressureless, plateless printing process, which uses jets of colored ink to 
produce an image of typographic quality at modest press speeds or of legible 
quality at high speeds. The ink is ejected under pressure through a nozzle 
and dispersed into uniform droplets which are charged electrostatically and 
are deflected by an electric field governed by a computer or another digital 
image-generating device.  An example of the methods for preparing printing plates by 
the ink-jet printing technique is Japanese Kokai Publication 113456/1981 
which proposed a method of preparing printing plates, wherein ink-repelling 
materials (e.g. curable silicone) are printed on a printing plate 
by ink-jet printing. The printing plate thus obtained is an intaglio 
printing plate in which the ink-repelling material formed on the surface 
of the substrate serves as the "non-image" part. As a result, the resolution 
of the printed images at shadow areas or reversed lines is not so 
satisfactory. Moreover, this method requires a large amount of ink, 
because the ink-repelling material must be deposited on the entire "non-image" 
part which occupies most of the surface of the printing plate. 
This, furthermore, delays the printing process. Japanese Kokai Publication 69244/1992 also discloses a method 
for making printing plates comprising the steps of: forming a printed 
image by ink-jet printing on a recording material previously subjected to 
a hydrophilic treatment, using a hydrophobic ink containing photocurable 
components; and exposing the whole surface to an active radiation. EP 533 168 A1 discloses a method for making printing plates 
using ink-jet printing for lithographic plates. In the above known method, the surface of the substrate to be 
used for the lithographic plate must, as a rule, be first subjected to 
various treatments such as a mechanical graining, an anodizing or a 
hydrophilic treatment so as to obtain
