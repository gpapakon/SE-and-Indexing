<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cycloolefin random 
copolymer pellets and processes for preparing the same. 
More particularly, the invention relates to cycloolefin 
random copolymer pellets which can be molded into products 
specifically showing such high optical properties that the 
reading errors caused by an optical disc substrate can be 
reduced when the molded product is used as the optical disc 
substrate and that the transparency of a transparent film 
can be remarkably improved when the molded product is used 
as the film, and to processes for preparing the pellets 
having such properties. The present applicant has proposed a variety of 
cycloolefin random copolymers formed from ethylene and 
specific cycloolefins, as described in, for example, 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 168708/1985 and 
specifications of Japanese Patent Applications No. 
220550/1984, No. 236828/1984, No. 236829/1984 and No. 
242336/1984. The cycloolefin random copolymers described 
in those publication and specifications not only shows 
excellent transparency and but also are excellent in  
 
various properties such as heat resistance, thermal aging 
resistance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance, 
dielectric properties and mechanical properties. Moreover, 
such cycloolefin random copolymers have good adhesion to 
substrates of various materials, though they are a kind of 
polyolefin. Accordingly, the cycloolefin random copolymers 
can be used, for example, in a field of optical materials 
such as optical memory discs and optical fibers, and a 
field of transparent containers and packaging materials 
such as transparent films and transparent containers. The cycloolefin random copolymers are generally 
pelletized, and the resulting pellets are molded into 
optical disc substrates, etc. When optical discs are 
manufactured from the pellets, reading errors sometimes 
occur, though the errors are very few. Further, when 
transparent films are formed from the pellets, the 
transparency of the films is sometimes reduced, though the 
level of the reduction is very low. The present inventor 
has earnestly studied to reduce the reading errors of the 
optical discs manufactured from the cycloolefin random 
copolymer pellets and to enhance the transparency of the 
transparent films formed from the pellets, and as a result, 
they have found that these problems are partially caused by 
cyclohexane-insoluble fine particles contained in the 
cycloolefin random copolymer pellets. The cyclohexane-insoluble fine particles
