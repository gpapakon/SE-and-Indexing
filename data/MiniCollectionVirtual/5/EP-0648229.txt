<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a biomaterial comprising an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN), wherein one of the polymer components is an acidic polysaccharide or a semi-synthetic derivative thereof. The polysaccharide can be hyaluronic acid, and the second polymer component can be a non-toxic, non-carcinogenic synthetic chemical polymer. The derivative can be a total or partial hyaluronic acid ester or a hyaluronic acid salt. The ester or salt can be formed with a pharmacologically active molecule. Methods for preparing the IPN are also disclosed. The acidic polysaccharide or derivative thereof and the synthetic chemical polymer comprising the IPN can be cross-linked, or the synthetic chemical polymer can be grafted onto the acidic polysaccharide. The cross-linking or grafting can be achieved using compounds capable of generating radicals, or via functional groups on the acidic polysaccharide and the synthetic chemical polymer. The IPN can be formed prior to cross-linking or grafting. The IPN biomaterial can be in the form of a film, a membrane, a sponge, a hydrogel, a guide channel, a thread, a gauze, or a non-woven tissue. Such IPN biomaterials can be used in the biomedical and sanitary fields, including dermatology, urology, orthopedics, otologic microsurgery, otoneurology, functional, post-traumatic and rhinosinusal endoscopic microsurgery, plastic surgery, and in the cardiovascular system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interpenetrating
polymer networks wherein one of the components is
a hyaluronic acid ester or a hyaluronic acid salt, a process
for their preparation, and their use as biomaterials for
biomedical and sanitary applications.Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a natural
heteropolysaccharide composed of alternate residues of
D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It is a
linear polymer with a molecular weight of between 50,000
and 13,000,000, depending upon the source from which it
is obtained and how it is prepared and analyzed. In
nature, it is present in pericellular gels, in the
fundamental substance of connective tissues in
vertebrate organisms, of which it is one of the main
components, in the synovial fluid of joints, the
vitreous humor, umbilical cord tissues, and in cocks' 
combs.Specific fractions of hyaluronic acid with definite
molecular weights are known which do not possess
inflammatory activity, and which can therefore be used
to facilitate wound healing or to substitute the
endobulbar fluids or in therapy for joint pathologies by
intra-articular injection, as described in European
Patent No. 0 138 572 granted to the present Applicants.Also known are esters of hyaluronic acid, in which
all or part of the carboxy groups of the acid are
esterified, and their use in pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics, and in biodegradable plastic materials, as
described in US Patents Nos. 4,851,521 and 4,965,353,
also granted to the present Applicants.It is a known fact that the application of
hyaluronic acid is able to accelerate healing in
patients with bedsores, wounds and burns. Its role in
the various stages of wound healing has been described,
with the aid of a theoretical model, by Weigel et al.
("A model for the role of hyaluronic acid and fibrin in
the early events during the inflammatory response and
wound healing," J. Theor. Biol., 119: 219, 1986).Studies aimed at obtaining products (biomaterials)
for medical, sanitary and pharmaceutical applications,
composed of hyaluronic acid esters or esters of other
polysaccharides used as such or in mixtures with other
polymers, have led to the creation of various products.
These include tissues such as gauzes of varying density
(number of threads per centimeter), of varying
dimensions and denier (weight per 9,000 meters of
thread), films, membranes, gels, guide channels, etc.
Some examples of films appear in two patents granted to
the present Applicants, namely US Patents Nos. 4,851,521
and 4,965,353. The use of such materials is limited
