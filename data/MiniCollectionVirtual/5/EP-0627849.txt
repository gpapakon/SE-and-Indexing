<ABSTRACT>
An on-screen display generator for use in an image 
display system is disclosed. The on-screen display generator 

includes a main image signal source (10), and an auxiliary image 
signal source (20,90,82,92,84,86) which includes a controller 

(40,120,82,84,86,88) for varying the perceived brightness of the 
image represented by the auxiliary image signal in response to a 

first control signal. A video signal processor 
(30,25,102,104,106,108,110), coupled to the main image signal 

source (10) and the auxiliary image signal source 
(20
,90,82,92,84,86), includes circuitry (104) for combining the 
main and auxiliary image signals to produce a combined image 

signal. The video signal processor further includes a controller 
(106) for varying the perceived brightness of the image 

represented by the combined image signal in response to a second 
control signal. A control signal generator (40,120,82,84,86,88) 

generates the first and the second control signals in such a 
manner that the perceived brightness of the auxiliary image signal 

remains substantially constant when the perceived brightness of 
the main image is varied. This on-screen display generator is 

disclosed as being embodied in a sleep timer in a television 
receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
On-screen displays have been used with image display
systems, such as television receivers, to give a viewer
information concerning the operation of the system. US-A-5 075 766 shows an example
of a use for such on-screen displays to display operating
parameters of the system, such as the channel number to which
the television receiver is tuned or a graphical representation of
the sound volume level in the form of a bar graph. Such displays
are generally used while the viewer is changing the associated
parameter. Thus, when the viewer is changing the channel, the
channel number is displayed superimposed atop the received main
image, and when the viewer is changing the sound volume, the
volume level bar graph is similarly displayed.Another example of a use for such on-screen displays
is in sleep timers, as shown in EP-A-0 437 833 or US-A-5 194 951. Sleep timers have been developed to enable a
viewer to select a time when the receiver should automatically
turn itself off should the viewer fall asleep, or otherwise lose
interest in watching. The viewer sets the turn-off time through
the use of the remote control. During the last minute or two
before the receiver is to turn off, current sleep timers gradually
turn down the sound volume so that a sudden change in the sound
level will not awaken a sleeping viewer. In addition, current sleep
timers provide an on-screen display, superimposed atop the main
image, to visually indicate to the viewer that the receiver will be
turning off in a short period of time. During this time interval,
sleep timers are responsive to some action by a viewer, such as
receipt of a signal from a remote control, to restore the volume
and display of the television receiver to their normal functions. If
no action is taken by a viewer during this pre-turn-off time
period, then at the selected turn-off time, power is removed from
the television receiver. One on-screen display used by known sleep timers
includes a textual message on the display screen indicating the
amount of time (e.g. number of seconds) before the television
receiver is going to turn itself off. Other on-screen displays
include an iconic symbol, which may include simple animation,
for example, a bar graph with a bar that gradually grows in length
from one end of the on-screen display toward the other. When the
bar reaches the other end of the on-screen display, the time
period is over, and the receiver turns itself off. Other on-screen
displays produce a black border from one or more edges of the
screen. This border
