<ABSTRACT>
The bottom part of the housing also forms the top cross-member of a window- or door-frame, and consists of an angle-section rail (12). This extends from an upwards-inclined wall-section (22) via a narrow vertical rib (23) to the housing cover (11). The top member (26) of the hinging window (8) or door has a chamfer (17) or curved face between its inner vertical and horizontal walls matching that (30) on the rail.The width of the vertical rib (23) can be less than one-third of the overall rail width, and it can be hollow, containing a profiled reinforcing member. It can extend away from the rail roughly in a horizontal plane through the lengthwise axis (31) of the shutter winding shaft.

Window or door with a roller blind box (10), the
bottom region of which is formed at the same time as the

top cross member of the fixed frame (9), against which the
sash frame (8) butts, wherein the top cross member of the

fixed frame (9) is formed as an angle section rail (12)
whose cavity (25), which is open towards the outside,

accommodates the greater part of the top transom (26) of
the sash frame ( 8), and the angle section rail (12)

comprises a wall part (22) which extends obliquely upwards
and out of the roller blind box and a narrow vertical web

(23) adjoining the wall part at the top and extending up to
the cover (11) of the roller blind box (10), characterised

in

a) that the top transom (26) of the sash frame (8)
is provided opposite the angle section rail (12)

with a bevel (27) or rounding between its inner
vertical wall (28) and inner horizontal wall (29),

and,
(b) that the bevel (27) or rounding at the top
transom (26) of the sash frame (8) is adapted to

a bevelled or rounded inner wall surface (30) of
the angle section rail (12).
Window or door with a roller blind box according to
claim 1, characterised in that the width of the vertical

web (23) is less than one third of the overall width of the
angle section rail (12).
Window or door with a roller blind box according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the narrow vertical web

(23) extends away from the wall part (22) of the angle
section rail (12) which leads obliquely outwards and

upwards approximately in a horizontal plane, which passes 
through the longitudinal axis (31) of the roller blind

winding pin.
Window or door with a roller blind box according to
one of claims 1 - 3, characterised in that the narrow

vertical web (23) of the angle section rail (12) is hollow
and comprises a reinforcing section (24).
