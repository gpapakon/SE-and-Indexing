<ABSTRACT>
A remote controlled laser apparatus for 
dismantling potentially hazardous plants by sealing off 

and cutting internally contaminated piping, comprising 
a working head (1,2,3,4,31) mounted on a mechanical arm 

or the like handling arrangement and effective to seal, 
by pairs of side-by-side welds across said piping, end 

portions of said piping following the squashing of 
same, and then perform the cutting, at an intermediate 

location to said welds, of the segments to be removed 
of said end sealed piping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a remote 
controlled apparatus for sealing and cutting piping 
of relatively small diameter, preferably by the use 
of a laser. In dismantling potentially hazardous plants, 
such as nuclear plants, in particular the fuel system 
thereof, or chemical plants that have been processing 
toxic substances, as well as in servicing such 
plants, the procedure followed to remove piping which 
contain contaminants is specially important. The techniques available heretofore for the 
above operation include plasma cutting, oxygen 
cutting, mechanical cutting using either saws or 
shears or abrasive cutters, and squashing followed by 
mechanical cutting, all of which fail to ensure full 
sealing of both the pipe portions to be removed and 
those to be left in place, thereby giving rise to 
two orders of problems: 
the release of contaminants to the environment 
from the pipe interiors; the need for attendance by human operators, 
risking exposure to contamination or radiation. An example of mechanical sealing and cutting is  
 
provided by EP-A-0538206 where a remotely controlled 
apparatus for sealing and cutting of internally 
contaminated pipes is disclosed in which a press 
first squashes a portion of a pipe, then two parallel 
wedges plastically cold set two adjacent sections of 
the squashed portion, the cold setting being followed 
by a punching operation, intermediate to the two 
adjacent sections, which cuts the pipe. Tight sealing of the parted pipe cannot be 
assured particularly if a pressurized fluid is 
contained therein. An example of plasma cutting technique is 
provided in the document JP-A-61253497 where it is 
proposed to first squash a portion of the pipe, then 
to cut the squashed portion by a plasma torch, which 
by melting the cut edges should provide tight sealing 
of the parted pipe. Even this technique is not as reliable as it 
would be desirable. It is the object of this invention, therefore, 
to overcome the above deficiencies of the  
 
prior art by providing a remote controlled apparatus 
equipped with a working head which can both cut pipes 
for removal from said potentially hazardous plants and 
seal off the cut pipes, thereby fully confining the 
contaminants to the interior of the pipes. These results are achieved by the apparatus 
of the present invention and an innovative technique 
which comprises the steps of first squashing a segment 
of the pipe at a section thereof, and then sealing it 
along two sections of the squashed segment, followed by
