<ABSTRACT>
A camera system incorporates an autofocus 
system. The 

autofocus system utilizes both a measurement of the 
intensity level of ambient light and a 

determination of whether the ambient light is 
natural or artificial to set lens focus position, 

aperture opening, shutter time and operation of a 
flash unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to automatic
camera systems. More specifically, the invention
relates to a camera system incorporating an
autofocusing system that operates based on the
intensity and type of ambient light to be imaged.Many inexpensive photographic cameras do not have
the ability to adjust the lens focus based on the
primary subject distance. The primary reason for
excluding automatic focusing (AF) capability from
cameras is the expense associated with conventional AF
systems. A fixed-focus camera system can incorporate a
less expensive lens and does not require the AF
electronics and/or mechanical interfaces required in AF
camera systems. It is well known, however, that a
substantial system speed and image performance loss
results from the exclusion of lens focusing capability
in a fixed-focus camera system.Attempts have been made to correlate ambient light
levels with a preferred lens-focus position. These
methods recognize that cameras without exposure control
are likely to produce under exposed images below a
threshold light level. An electronic flash unit must
therefore be employed to obtain a useful film exposure.
The range of an electronic flash unit is limited,
however, thus the focus point for the camera lens must
be brought within the flash range. If the flash is
used and the ambient aperture and lens focus position
are retained, unnecessary depth-of-field (extending
well beyond the useful flash range) is imparted to the 
image, and flash power is wasted due to the small lens
opening. If the ambient lens focus position is
retained and a larger lens opening is used for flash,
flash power is used more efficiently, but the focus
point lies outside the optimum flash focus point. As a
result, the depth-of-field is not correctly or
optimally positioned within the flash range.U.S. Patent 4,710,013, for example, discloses a
photographic camera system that controls lens position,
flash and diaphragm/aperture settings based on a
measured ambient light level. Although the disclosed
system is described as an "autofocusing mechanism", the
system can more appropriately be described as a light-level
based lens positioning system, since the lens
position is not related to the image location/subject
position. Specifically, the lens is positioned
alternately for distant and near objects based on the
measured ambient light level. If the ambient light
level is below a preset threshold level, the control
system activates a flash unit, moves the diaphragm to a
fully open position, and move the lens

A camera system comprising: a lens (10) that is
adjustable between a plurality of discrete, predetermined

lens focus positions; an aperture (12) that is adjustable
between a plurality of openings; a shutter (14); a flash unit

(16); ambient light measurement means (20) for measuring the
intensity of the ambient light of a scene to be photographed

and generating a signal indicative thereof; ambient light
type determination means (22) for generating a signal

indicative of whether the ambient light is natural light or
artificial light; and control means (18), which in response

to the signals generated by the ambient light measurement

control means positions the lens to the nominal-daylight

position, opens the aperture to the small opening and does
not activate the flash unit, when the ambient light level is

above a threshold value.
