<ABSTRACT>
In the case of circuits fabricated in CMOS technology with silicide layer, the problem arises of the low breakdown voltages of conventional ESD protective structures. The object of the invention is therefore to connect a well resistor (21) between a doping region (20) of the component of a protective structure and the input/output contact (8), between the contact doping regions (20, 22) of which resistor a local oxide or a transistor gate (16) is arranged. Interruption of the silicide layer is therefore made possible without additional process steps.
