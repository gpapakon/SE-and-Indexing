<ABSTRACT>
C1-C4-alkyl nitrites can be prepared by reacting C1-C4-alkanols with nitrogen oxides without involving oxygen, the process being carried out in a reactor designed as a scrubbing column, the nitrogen oxide employed in the lower portion of the reactor being dinitrogen trioxide, namely a) as such, b) in the form of a mixture with nitrogen monoxide or c) in the form of a mixture of its precursors nitrogen monoxide/nitrogen dioxide, or nitrogen monoxide/dinitrogen tetroxide. 5 to 60% of the total amount of the C1-C4-alkanol employed is also employed in the lower portion of the reactor in the form of vapours or of a spray, while the remaining C1-C4-alkanol is applied to the column head.
