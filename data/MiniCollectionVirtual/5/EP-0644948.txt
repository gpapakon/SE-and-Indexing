<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed anti-receptor agents to the vitamin B12/transcobalamin II receptor. The anti-receptor agents antagonize or modulate the vitamin B12/transcobalamin II receptor, causing cellular depletion of vitamin B12, thus preventing or inhibiting cell division. Anti-receptor agents of the present invention include proteins (such as antibodies and antibody derivatives), peptides and small organic molecules. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-receptor agent is an antibody to the vitamin B12/transcobalamin II receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to anti-receptor agents to the
vitamin B12/transcobalamin II receptor, and more specifically, to agents which can
cause the cellular depletion of vitamin B12 by antagonizing or modulating the
vitamin B12/transcobalamin II receptor, thereby inhibiting cell division of normal
or neoplastic cells.Experimental in vitro data, pre-clinical animal models, and patient
studies have demonstrated the requirement of proliferating normal and neoplastic
cells for vitamin B12. This nutrient is a co-factor for enzymes necessary in cell
division, as well as cellular metabolism. The nutrient is derived from dietary
intake and is transported throughout the body complexed to transport proteins. The
complex of transport protein and vitamin B12 is recognized by a cellular receptor
which internalizes the complex and releases the vitamin intracellularly. The overall
process has been recently reviewed (GUT 31:59, 1991). Vitamin B12 is taken in
through the diet. Binding proteins in the saliva (R-binder) and gut (intrinsic factor(IF))
complex B12 after release from endogenous binding proteins by action of
enzymes and low pH in the stomach. B12 is transferred across the intestinal
epithelium in a receptor specific fashion to transcobalamin II (TcII). The vitamin
B12/transcobalamin II complex is then transported throughout the body and
recognized by receptors present on dividing cells, internalized and released within
the cell where it is utilized by certain enzymes as a co-factor.The high affinity receptor in dividing tissues or cells responsible for
internalization of B12 recognizes transcobalamin II complexed with vitamin B12.
The B12/TcII receptor recognizes only the vitamin B12/transcobalamin complex
and not the serum transport protein or the vitamin alone. The receptor is
undetectable on non-dividing cells; the mechanism for supplying non-dividing cells
with vitamin B12 is poorly understood. However, it is known that more vitamin
B12 is required during cell division than during metabolism, and that the B12/TcII
receptor is the only high affinity means for cellular uptake of vitamin B12 during
cell division. When stimulated to divide, cells demonstrate transient expression of 
this receptor leading to B12 uptake which precedes actual DNA synthesis (J. Lab.
Clin. Med. 103:70, 1984). Vitamin B12 receptor levels may be measured by
binding of 57Co-cobalamin complexed to transcobalamin II (present in serum) on
replicate cultures grown in chemically defined medium without serum. No
receptor
