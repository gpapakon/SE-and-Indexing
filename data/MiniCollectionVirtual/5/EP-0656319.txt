<ABSTRACT>
Alpha alumina powder having a regulated particle size, a 
uniform particle shape and a narrow particle size distribution and 

further a low halogen content is produced by calcining at least one 
starting material selected from transition alumina and alumina 

compounds in a halogen-containing atmosphere which comprises a 
hydrogen halide gas, a halogen gas or a mixture of a halogen gas and 

steam and contains at least 0.1 % by volume of at least one halogen-containing 
gas selected from the group consisting of hydrogen halide 

gas and halogen gas, and removing halogen from a calcined material. 
The produced alpha-alumina powder is excellent in a packing 

property and homogeneously packed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
α-alumina powder having regulated particle
size and particle shape, a narrow particle size distribution and a low
halogen content, and a method for producing such α-alumina powder.Alpha-alumina powder is widely used as a raw material
of an abrasive, a sintered body, and the like, and various production
methods thereof are known. But, such conventional methods have the
following drawbacks.For example, a method disclosed in Japanese Patent
KOKAI Publication No. 131517/1991 (a flux method) produces only
particles of α-alumina powder which have a hexagonal close-packed
lattice and a particle shape of a hexagonal plate having a ratio D/H of
5 to 40 in which D is the maximum particle size in a direction parallel
to the hexagonal lattice plane and H is a particle size in a direction
perpendicular to the hexagonal lattice plane, and this method
also has a problem that the shape of the particle is not uniform.Alpha-alumina powder produced by a method disclosed in
GB Patent No. 990,801 and German Patent No. 1,767,511 has a nonuniform
particle shape and a wide particle size distribution. Alpha-alumina
powder produced by a method disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 8929/1968 contains less impurity but has a wide
particle size distribution.US-A-2961297 discloses a process for purification of
alumina to remove soda; the process comprises calcining alumina
with aluminum fluoride as fluoride mineralizer.WO 90/15777 describes a process for producing α-alumina
particles having a plate-like shape.EP-A-105025 discloses octahedral shaped α-Al2O3 particles
having a D/H-ratio equal or less than 2. A method disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.
22886/1982 makes it possible to control the particle size of α-alumina
powder by the addition of corundum as a seed crystal.
However, this production method is not effective industrially, since
it requires a high pressure and a long time.A method disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication
No. 97528/1984 can produce α-alumina powder having an average
particle size of 1 to 10 µm and a shape with the D/H ratio of about 1,
but α-alumina powder contains remaining boron or fluorine which is
used as a mineralizer in the production method and includes many
agglomerates which are formed in a sintering step.As described above, the known methods have a drawback
that the produced α-alumina powder has a low packing property and
cannot be homogeneously packed since the control of the particle
size of the produced α-alumina powder is difficult, the
