<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of rehabilitating contaminated soils and plant for carrying out the method, characterised in that the contaminated soils (3) which have been excavated and treated beforehand are introduced into a contact cell (10, 11) in the bottom part of which the injection of the third element, in the direction of the lateral walls of said cell, forms a contaminated solution which is subsequently collected in the top part, while the soils which are continuously separated from the contaminated solution are recovered in the bottom part of said cell, before being rinsed (22, 23) and dried (27).
