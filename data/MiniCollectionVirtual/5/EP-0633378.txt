<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an espagnolette lock which is blocked against return, as a result of gear play, by means of a blocking member cooperating with an espagnolette connecting slide and with a rotatable gear element belonging to an espagnolette-actuating gear. In order to develop the lock advantageously in terms of production and use, an arrangement of the blocking member (10) between the paths of movement of a control cam (7', 1') assigned respectively to the connecting slide (7) and to the gear element (1) is provided. Preferably, the blocking member (10) is to be in sliding bearing contact with the control cam (7') of the connecting slide by means of a first blocking nose (18') and in sliding bearing contact by means of a second blocking nose (19') with a control cam (1') formed by a circumferential surface of the rotatable gear element (1).

Espagnolette locked against backward movement as a result of gear backlash by 
means of a catch lever (10) cooperating with a driving rod connecting slide (7) and 

a rotatable link element (1) associated with a driving rod control gear and pivotable 
about an axis fixedly arranged relative to the gear casing, characterised in that the 

catch lever (10) is hinged between the path of motion of respective control curves 
(7', 1') associated with the connecting slide (7) and the link element (1), the catch 

lever (10) having two arms (18, 19), one arm (18) of which cooperates with the 
control curve (7') of the connecting slide (7) having a control cam (11) and the 

other arm (19) of which cooperates with a control curve (1') of the link element (1) 
having a releasing recess (23, 22), wherein the cam (11) of the connecting slide (7) 

operates upon sliding displacement of one arm of the catch lever (10) and the catch 
lever (10) can then pivot if the second arm (19) of the catch lever (10) is situated 

opposite the releasing recess (23, 22) of the link element. 
Espagnolette according to claim 1, characterised in that one arm (18) bears slidably 
against the control curve (7') of the connecting slide (7) via a first locking 

projection (18') and the other arm (19) bears slidably against the control curve (1') 
formed by a circumferential surface of the rotatable link element (1) via a second 

locking projection (19'). 
Espagnolette according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the control curve (1') forms a cam (24). 
Espagnolette according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the link element (1) has toothing (25). 
Espagnolette according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the link element (I) is a toothed rim which can be driven by a profile cylinder 

closure element and drives the driving rod connecting slide (7) by means of output 
gears (2, 3, 4).  

 
Espagnolette according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the catch lever (10) is inserted into the releasing recess (22, 23) of the link element 

upon operation of the control cam (11) of the closing cylinder lock-actuated driving 
rod connecting slide (7). 
Espagnolette according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the catch lever (10) bearing in a cam-controlled manner against the circumferential 

control surface (24) of the link element upon return operation of the driving rod 
connecting slide (7) blocks the movement of the connecting slide (7).
