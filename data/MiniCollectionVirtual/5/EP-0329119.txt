<ABSTRACT>
A showcase (1) for preserving and/or displaying articles, wherein its walls (4), bottom (3) and lid construction (2) surround the inside space of the showcase in a more or less airtight manner, filter devices (7), which preferably have dust and/or gas protection filters and are arranged in a ventilation nozzle (5), cleaning air which flows or is passed into the showcase. In the case of automatic air supply flow as a result of changed pressure or temperature conditions in and outside the showcase, the ventilation of the showcase preferably takes place via a nozzle (6, 9) constructed as an outlet valve. If the showcase can only be sealed off inadequately, it is preferably forcibly ventilated via the filter devices with the smallest possible quantities of air with the aid of a pump or ventilator device connected to the interior of the showcase, said quantities of air being adapted to the volumes of air flowing automatically into the showcase in the case of rapid air pressure increase or change in temperature.

<CLAIMS>
A showcase for preserving and/or displaying articles 
and whose walls, base and roof construction enclose a 

showcase area which is enclosed in a more or less 
airtight fashion, an air-conveying device (10) being 

provided which is connected to the showcase, introducing 
an airflow into said showcase, providing an automatic air 

supply, filter devices (7) being provided through which 
the airflow is passed into the showcase area, the flow 

rate of the air-conveying device (10) being set at values 
which keep the showcase area at a slight excess pressure 

relative to the surrounding environment, even during the 
most violent climatic fluctuations in the environment, 

which would otherwise cause an inflow of unpurified air 
into the showcase area. 
A showcase for preserving and/or displaying articles 
and whose walls, base and roof construction enclose a 

showcase area which is substantially sealed off, a filter 
device (7) being connected to an air inlet point (B) 

provided on the showcase so that, upon climatic 
fluctuations in the surroundings of the showcase, 

surrounding air no longer flows in through the seals of 
the showcase area, but in a purified manner through the 

air inlet point (B) with filter device (7).  
 
A showcase according to Claim or 2, characterised in 
that the filter devices (7) have a dust or gas filter 

which may be connected to an air inlet nozzle (5, 5′) 
provided on the showcase. 
A showcase according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that there is further provided on the air inlet nozzle 

(5) a valve (8) which admits only the air inlet flow into 
the interior of the showcase, and in that a further 

nozzle (6, 9) designed as an outlet valve is provided for 
air removal from the showcase. 
A showcase according to Claim 1 or 3, characterised in 
that the air-conveying device (10) supplies gases other 

than air. 
A showcase according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that there is used as an air-conveying device a pump 

(10), which may be located alternatively in the pedestal 
(3) of the showcase or in the illumination case (2) of 

the showcase. 
A showcase according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the air pressure in the environment of the showcase is 

measured by means of a pressure sensor, whose measurement 
value is passed to a control device connected to the pump 

(10), said control device switching on the pump only when  
 

there is an increase in air pressure. 
A showcase according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the filter devices (7) may be disposed alternatively on 

the air inlet or on the air outlet side of the pump (10). 
A showcase according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the pump (10) pumps into the interior of the showcase air 

whose moisture content is set and/or regulated by means 
of a cooling apparatus. 
A showcase according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that there is provided a pressure-monitoring device which 

ascertains the pressure in the interior of the showcase 
(1′) and corrects it via a control line connected to the 

pump (10), and in that the pressure-monitoring device 
comprises or is connected to a device which gives 

indication of a sudden pressure drop. 
A showcase according to Claim 1 or 5, characterised 
in that the automatic air supply is effected by means of 

a container connected to the interior of the showcase by 
air supply pipes and a pressure-reducing valve, purified 

air or another gas being contained at high pressure in 
said container.
