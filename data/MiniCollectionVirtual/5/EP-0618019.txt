<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a roll force control device on a cold-strip rolling stand, particularly a foil-rolling stand, with a device for adjusting the chocks (3,4) of a back-up roll (5,6) of the rolling stand by means of an infinitely variable adjustable device acting perpendicularly to the rolling plane and of a lifting cylinder which is inserted coaxially into the adjusting device and on the end of the piston rod of which the back-up roll chock is releasably suspended. The invention is characterised in that the adjusting device is - as known per se - designed as a double-acting piston-cylinder unit (15,16), into the piston (16) of which the lifting cylinder (17) is centrally inserted and in that the piston-cylinder unit can be supplied in a controlled manner with pressure media to regulate the roll force.

Roll force control device on a cold strip roll stand, comprising a device for adjusting 
and lifting the chock (3) of a support roller (5) of the roll stand by means of an adjusting 

device (15, 16), which acts perpendicular to the plane of rolling and which is infinitely 
adjustable, and by means of a counterbalancing cylinder (17), which is inserted 

coaxially into the adjusting device (15, 16) and on whose piston rod end the support 
roller chock is detachably suspended, characterised in that the adjusting device (15, 

16) capable of being acted on in a controlled manner with pressure media is formed 

as a roll force adjusting device (15, 16) capable of being acted on double-sidedly and 
in whose piston (16) the counterbalancing cylinder (17) is concentrically disposed. 
Roll force control device according to claim 1, characterised in that the pressure 
medium is introducible into its cylinder cavities through the piston rod (18) of the 

counterbalancing cylinder (17). 
Roll force control device according to claim 1 and 2, characterised in that the piston 
rod (18) is provided outside the adjusting device (15, 16) with a device for countering 

rotation in the form of a square (23), in the region of which the passage (24) for the 
pressure medium is provided.
