<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a device for detecting an abnormality in relays which is 
adapted such that if there is a current flow through a motor (M) when first and 

second transistors (Q1, Q2) are off resulting from an abnormality such as melting 
of first and second motor driving relays (RL1, RL2), a controller (1) turns on the 

transistors (Q1, Q2) of a motor driving portion (2) in response to a detection signal 
from a signal detecting portion (3) and accordingly provides the same potential 

across the motor (M) to stop the motor (M) without a conventionally complicated, 
costly construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a relay abnormality detecting device for
detecting an abnormality in relays for driving a motor such as an automotive door
lock motor, an automotive power window motor, and an automotive sun roof motor.In the past, forward and backward rotations of a motor such as an automotive
door lock motor have been controlled by a circuit as shown in Fig. 5, for example.Referring to Fig. 5, when a forward or backward rotation command is applied
to a controller 1 including an ECU by actuation of an input portion SW including
a switch, a switching control signal output terminal O1 or O2 of the controller 1
outputs a high-level (referred to as "H" hereinafter) switching control signal to a
base of an first NPN transistor Q1 serving as a switching element for forward
rotation or to a base of a second NPN transistor Q2 serving as a switching element
for backward rotation, to turn on the transistor Q1 or Q2. When the transistor Q1
turns on, current flows from a battery +B serving as a power supply through a fuse
F2 to a relay coil C1 of a first motor driving relay RL1 to excite the relay coil C1.
Then a c-contact T1 of the first relay RL1 is switched from a normally-closed
terminal to a normally-open terminal. Likewise, when the transistor Q2 turns on,
current flows from the battery +B through the fuse F2 to a relay coil C2 of a
second motor driving relay RL2 to excite the relay coil C2. Then a c-contact T2 
of the second relay RL2 is switched from a normally-closed terminal to a
normally-open terminal.At this time, a motor driving portion 2 for driving a motor M is formed by the
transistors Q1, Q2, and the relays RL1, RL2.Switching of the c-contact T1 to the normally-open terminal by excitation of
the first relay RL1 causes current from the battery +B to flow to a ground through
a fuse F1, the normally-open terminal and a common terminal of the c-contact T1
of the first relay RL1, the motor M, and a common terminal and the normally-closed
terminal of the c-contact T2 of the second relay RL2. The current flows
through the motor M in a direction of forward rotation to forwardly rotate the
motor M.On the other hand, switching of the c-contact T2 to the normally-open
terminal by excitation of the second relay RL2 causes current from the battery +B
to flow to a ground through the fuse F2, the normally-open terminal and a common
terminal of the c-contact T2 of the second relay RL2, the motor M, and a common
terminal and the normally-closed terminal of the c-contact T1 of the first relay
RL1.
