<ABSTRACT>
The position sensor according to the invention exhibits a sensor (3), the output signal (Sd) of which is dependent on the distance (d) between a measurement division (1) and a scanning unit (2). So that the distance-dependent measurement signal (Sd) is independent of temperature changes, the sensor (3) consists of a voltage divider circuit with an active branch (4) and a supplementary branch (5). In the active branch (4), magnetoresistive elements (41) are arranged which scan the measurement division (1). In the supplementary branch (5), resistive elements (51) are arranged which have the same temperature characteristics as the magneto-resistive elements (41) of the active branch (4) but have no sensitivity to magnetic fields. The voltage across the active branch (4) is the distance-dependent measurement signal (Sd) by means of which the amplitude of the position-dependent scanning signals (S1, S2) of the measurement division (1) can be regulated.
