<ABSTRACT>
A worker platform assembly (10) is modular in construction so as to 
be configurable according to the configuration and size, 

particularly width, requirements of each bridge and to metal 
surfaces thereof which are to be reconditioned by abrasive 

stripping and recoating. The assembled platform (10) is suspendable at 
each end by suspension frame assemblies (80) which are rollable along 

the parapets (6) of the bridge for repositioning the platform 
assembly (10), 

with the suspension assembly (96) being adjustable to various 
configurations of parapets (6). An adjustable curtain frame enables 

sealed enclosure of bridge surfaces to be treated and optimum 
access of workers to those surfaces during the treatment. Airborne 

residue is evacuated by vacuum for subsequent disposal in a manner 
which does not contaminate the environment, while heavier residue 

and spent abrasive grit is collected and positively moved off of 
the platform assembly for subsequent, environmentally safe 

separation and reconstitution of the grit for reuse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of maintenance of steel bridge supports and
the like and is directed to platforms from which workers can treat steel surfaces
on the undersides and tops of the bridges, particularly during removal of rust
and paint by blasting the metal surfaces with particles.So-called OSHA regulations provide stringent requirements for
containment of any debris resulting from such treatment and capable of
contaminating the surrounding environment, both during and after the
treatment. From an economic standpoint, it is preferable to collect, clean and
reuse the particles used in abrasive blasting.Thus, an object of the invention is to provide an apparatus upon which
workers are supported so that they can stand and walk to address the metal
surfaces to be stripped and recoated, while improving upon previous attempts at
containing and collecting the contaminating airborne debris and heavier, spent
particles in a manner which is safe for the environnment.A work platform assembly of the general type concerned by the invention
is disclosed in US-A-5 011 710. Such a work platform assembly positionable at
and spanning an underside of a bridge deck so as to provide support for worker
access to and treatment of surfaces of supporting structures of said bride,
comprises :
at least one module having :
trough means extending longitudinally of said module for collecting
particulate material at a bottom thereof, grating means positioned atop said
trough means for allowing particulate material to pass therethrough into said
trough means; andenclosure means covering areas between said platform assembly and said
bridge deck underside and supporting structures, for blocking spent abrasive
particles and residue resulting from said treatment of surfaces of the bridge from
a surrounding environment outside of said platform assembly.However, contrary to the invention, this known assembly provides for
vacuum discharge means which are not completely satisfying due to the possible
clogging of certain areas of the transport line. Besides, no specific provision is
made in the case of a platform consisting of several modules for connecting
modules together and conveying the debris collected in the trough of each
module to discharge them out of the work platform assembly.It is thus a further object of the invention to provide that the work
platform includes a hopper for collecting used abrasive grit and a mechanical
conveyor for positively driving the used grit out of the hopper in order to
evacuate the grit for
