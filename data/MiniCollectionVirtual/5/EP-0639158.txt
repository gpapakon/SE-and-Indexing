<ABSTRACT>
Wood-resin-containing process water or wastewater from the pulp industry is purified by adding, as flocculants, a high-molecular-weight polyethylene oxide and a water-soluble, non-ionic cellulose ether, suitably having a flocculation temperature of 35-80  DEG C. The added amount per litre of water is preferably 2-20 mg of the high-molecular-weight polyethylene oxide and preferably 5-30 mg of the non-ionic cellulose ether.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for purifying 
process water or wastewater containing wood resin, 
by adding a high-molecular-weight polyethylene oxide and 
a water-soluble, non-ionic cellulose ether as flocculants. In the making of pulp, the pulp washing step yields 
process water and wastewater containing a number of undesired 
substances and products, such as resin, hemicellulose, 
lignin and fines. Such process water and wastewater 
give rise, among other things, to discoloration of the 
pulp as well as high oxygen consumption upon emission into 
a water recipient. There is thus a manifest need to be 
able to reduce, as far as possible, the contents of these 
substances and products. It is generally known, e.g. from Canadian Patent 
1,004,782, to add a high-molecular-weight polyethylene 
oxide and a phenolformaldehyde resin to wastewater from 
the pulp industry with a view to removing such undesired 
products by flocculation. A similar process is known from 
Swedish Patent Publication 454,507, where, in addition to 
a high-molecular-weight polyethylene oxide and a phenolformaldehyde 
resin, a cationic starch or cellulose derivative 
is added. It has however been found that it is difficult to 
bring about effective purification of wood-resin-containing 
process water or wastewater without using high contents 
of high-molecular-weight polyethylene oxide. It is 
however desirable to reduce the amount of high-molecular-weight 
polyethylene oxide, since it is difficult to produce 
and hence is very expensive, as well as to further 
improve the degree of purification of the resin-rich process 
water or wastewater. It has now been found that surprisingly effective 
purification of wood-resin-containing process water or 
wastewater from the pulp industry can be achieved by  
 
adding a water-soluble, non-ionic cellulose ether, preferably 
having a flocculation temperature of 35-80°C, and a 
high-molecular-weight polyethylene oxide as flocculants. 
The content of wood resin in the process water or wastewater 
may vary within wide limits. Even at as low contents 
as 0.1 g/l water, significant effects are achieved, 
although this content generally amounts to at least 
0.4 g/l water, measured according to the method described 
in SE 8403587-2. Normally, the content does not exceed 
50 g/l water. For process water or wastewater originating 
from the making of mechanical pulps, the resin content 
preferably is 0.7-2 g/l water, while the resin content of 
process water or wastewater from the production
