<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a series of novel
8-(fluorinated methoxy)-4-oxoquinoline-carboxylic acid
derivatives which have been found to have valuable and
powerful antibacterial activity. The invention also
provides compositions containing these compounds,
methods of using them and processes for preparing them.The compounds of the present invention are
1-cyclopropyl-4-oxo-6-fluoro-7-(optionally substituted
heterocyclic)-8-(fluorinated methoxy)-quinoline-3-carboxylic
acid derivatives and 1-cyclopropyl-4-oxo-5-amino-6-fluoro-7-(optionally
substituted heterocyclic)-8-(fluorinated
methoxy)-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid
derivatives.It is an unfortunate fact of modern medicine that
many infectious bacteria are gradually developing
resistance to the antibiotics commonly used to treat
infection caused by them, with the result that known
antibacterial agents are increasingly becoming of
limited effectiveness. There is, therefore, a
continuing need to develop new antibacterial agents,
which may, even if only for a restricted period, be
effective against infectious bacteria. Most of the
common antibacterial agents in present day use were
originally developed from fermentation products,
although some are of wholly synthetic origin.There have been proposals to use certain
4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as
antibacterial agents. For example, European Patent
Publication No. 78 362 discloses a limited class of 
1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)quinoline-3-carboxylic
acid derivatives, in
which the piperazinyl group is unsubstituted or has a
methyl, ethyl or β-hydroxyethyl substituent at the
4-position. These prior art compounds resemble certain
of the compounds of the present invention, except that
they lack the 8-fluorinated methoxy group which has been
found to be critical to the achievement of the excellent
activity of the compounds of the present invention.European Patent Publications No. 106 489, No.
153 163, No. 230 295, No. 235 762 and No. 241 206
disclose classes of quinoline derivatives, including
amongst many others, some 1-substituted-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-6-halo-7-(optionally
substituted heterocyclic)-8-substituted-quinoline-3-carboxylic
acid derivatives,
of which in some the 8-substituent is an alkoxy group,
but they do not disclose any compounds in which the
8-substituent is a fluorinated methoxy group.Of the compounds disclosed in European Patent
Publication No. 78 362, one, namely Norfloxacin, whose
systematic name is
