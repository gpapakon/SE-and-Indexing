<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for localised etching of a conducting layer (4) deposited on an insulating layer (2) at least some parts of which are very thin, the said insulating layer being formed on at least one face of a silicon chip (1). This process includes the step consisting in subjecting the surface being etched to irradiation by ultra-violet radiation, at least during the final phase of the etching.
