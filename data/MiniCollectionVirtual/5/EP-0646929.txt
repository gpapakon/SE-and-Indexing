<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor static random access memory device 
includes an address decoder unit (34a) and a memory cell 

array (32) implemented by field effect transistors, a 
differential amplifier circuit (35a) having a pair of 

bipolar transistors (QB10/QB11) for increasing a potential 
difference indicative of a read-out data bit and a level 

shift circuit (40) operative to change a voltage range of a 
selecting signal (YA/YS') supplied to a field effect 

activation transistor (Qn10) coupled between the common 
emitter node of the bipolar transistors for activating the 

differential amplifier circuit, and the level shift circuit 
has a field effect switching transistor (Qn13) and a 

bipolar transistor (QB14) coupled in series and another 
field effect switching transistor (Qn14) coupled between 

the collector node and the base node of the bipolar 
transistor (QB14) so as to make the source-to-drain voltage 

of the field effect activation transistor large (Qn10), 
thereby allowing the field effect activation transistor 

(Qn10) to stably operate in the saturated range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated
circuit device and, more particularly, to a bi-MOS
implementation of a semiconductor integrated circuit device
having a stable sense amplifier.Field effect transistors of semiconductor integrated
circuit device have been miniaturized. The miniature field
effect transistors are much liable to be damaged by large
electric field strength, and a semiconductor integrated
circuit device is equipped with an internal step-down power
supply system for preventing the miniature transistors from
damage.A typical example of the semiconductor integrated circuit
device such as known from IEEE INTERNATIONAL SOLID-STATE
CIRCUITS CONFERENCE, vol. 35, 1992, New York, US, p. 212-286,
is a semiconductor static random access memory device, and
parts of the semiconductor static random access memory device
are replaced with bipolar circuits for accelerating the access
speed.Figure 1 illustrates an essential part of the prior art
semiconductor static random access memory device, and a 
sense amplifier unit 1 is accompanied with a level shift
circuit 2. Although static memory cells and row and column
address decoders (not shown) are implemented by miniature
field effect transistors, bipolar transistors QB1, QB2, QB3
and QB4 are used as essential circuit components of the
sense amplifier unit 1, because the bipolar transistors QB1
to QB4 can increase an extremely small potential difference
produced by the miniature field effect transistors at high
speed.The sense amplifier unit 1 is broken down into a
differential amplifier circuit 1a electrically connected to
a digit line pair and a cascade amplifier 1b coupled to an
input and output circuit (not shown), and a read data bus
lines RB and RBB connect the differential amplifier circuit
1a and the cascade amplifier circuit 1b.The bipolar transistors QB1 and QB2 and an n-channel
enhancement type switching transistor Qn1 form the
differential amplifier circuit 1a. The collector nodes of
the bipolar transistors QB1 and QB2 are respectively
coupled to the read data bus lines RBB and RB, and the
digit lines supply an extremely small potential difference
to the base nodes of the bipolar transistors QB1 and QB2.
The n-channel enhancement type switching transistor Qn1 has 
a drain-to-source path from the common emitter node of the
bipolar transistors QB1 and QB2 and an internal negative
power voltage line VEEM.The cascade amplifier circuit 1b comprises two series
combinations of resistors R1/R2 and the bipolar transistors
QB3/QB4 coupled
