<ABSTRACT>
The running gear includes a pair of bearing wheels (14) resting on the track, which can be oriented about parallel axes (18) on a fixed part, and two pairs of guide wheels (24) for bearing laterally against the track. The pairs of guide wheels are situated on either side of the bearing wheels, and are carried by one and the same guide frame (30) which can move only in rotation about a vertical axis (29) relative to the fixed part. The guide frame is connected to the bearing wheels by a linkage (32, 34, 36) for forced orientation of the bearing wheels. The fixed part consists of a transverse box beam (40, 42) placed above the guide frame (30) and equipped with pivots for orienting the bearing wheels, these pivots being placed above suspension mounts (cushions, pads) (38) of the vehicle.

A wheel set for a vehicle designed to travel on 
a guide track, having a pair of load-carrying wheels (14), 

steerable about parallel axes (18) relative to a fixed 
portion, and two pairs of guide wheels (24) for bearing 

laterally against the track, the pairs of guide wheels being 
situated on either side of the load-carrying wheels, and 

being carried by a common guide frame (30) that is 
displaceable relative to the fixed portion, each guide wheel 

(24) being mounted without any freedom of translation on the 
guide frame (30), the fixed portion being constituted by a 

transverse box girder (40,42) placed above the guide frame 
(30) and provided with steering pivots (44) for the load-carrying 

wheels, which pivots are placed beneath cushions 
(38) providing suspension for the vehicule on the wheel set,
 
   characterized in that the guide frame is 

displaceable relative to the fixed portion only in rotation 
about a vertical axis (29), and is connected to the load-carrying 

wheels by a linkage (32,34,36) for forced steering 
of the load carrying wheels. 
A wheel set according to claim 1, characterized 
in that each of the load-carrying wheels (14) is connected 

via a stepdown gear box (52) and a constant velocity joint 
(50) to the annular rotor (54) of an electric traction motor 

whose stator (46) is fixed to a lateral flange (42) 
supporting one of the lateral pneumatic cushions (38) and 

receiving the steering pivot (44) of said load-carrying 
wheel. 
A wheel set according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said annular rotor (54) is connected to the constant 

velocity joint (50) via a central shaft (48) passing through 
the stator (46) and carrying a disk brake (54) on its end 

opposite to the load-carrying wheel (14). 
A wheel set according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the electric motors are polyphase  

 
motors having permanent-magnet rotors. 
A wheel set according to claim 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the motors are placed inside the 

girder (40,42), which has openings (60) formed therein to 
allow ventilation air to pass. 
A wheel set according to any one of claims 2 to 
5, characterized in that said flanges (42) belong to the 

girder. 
A wheel set according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the guide frame (30) is H-shaped 

with the cross-bar of the H-shape being suspended 
from the girder (40,42) by a ball-bearing ring (31). 
A wheel set according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the cross-bar is connected to a steering arm (32) 

for a load-carrying wheel via a link (36) which is hinged at 

both ends. 
A wheel set according to any one of the 
precedings claims, characterized in that the forced steering 

linkage includes a link (36) providing a connection between 
the guide frame (30) and a load-carrying wheel, and also a 

conjugating link between the two load-carrying wheels.
