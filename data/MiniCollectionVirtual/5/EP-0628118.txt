<DESCRIPTION>
DEVICE IN A WINDING STAIRCASEThe invention relates to a winding staircase according to the introductory part of patent claim 1.BackgroundThere is a need to be able to manufacture in series elements for winding staircases, to permit the construction of staircases to suit rooms of different and unknown heights, or different distances between the room separators. It is required that the elements make it possible to adjust the height of the steps in situ, thereby making it possible to form the staircases with a total height of arbitrary dimensions.It is known to provide carriers for the outer ends of steps which enable adjustment of the steps within a range of options of adjustment. Satisfying solutions to the central step suspension have not been devised. Some solutions provide fixed step heights, while other solutions have required craftsmanlike adjustment at the building site. This solution has not been satisfactory since high skill and time consuming work are required. At the same time, there is a risk of an inferior result compared to staircases manufactured in factories and according to required measurement.Another problem with known staircases is that of creaking.ObjectThe main object of the invention is to produce a winding staircase which is easy to adjust according to different heights of room by means of simple standard elements. The staircases must be easy to instal and must meet estethical demands as well as fullfil ordinary requirements of usage. It must not creak. Most users find creaking to be unacceptable. 

The inventionThe invention is described in the characterizing part of patent claim 1. Further advantageous features of the invention are described in the subsidiary claims.By using the system of support elements as described, one will gain flexibility with simple standard elements. One kind of support element may be used to build staircases of all heights. This provides great savings in manufacturing and storage while also simplifying installation.The shape of the upper edge and the supporting element system can be supplemented by sloping elements and elements enabling adjustment, for instance elastic bannister elements making the upper edge easier to grab.ExampleThe invention is described in further detail with reference to the drawings, whereinFig. 1 shows a plan sketch of the inner part of a left orientated 270° - winding staircase,Fig. 2 is an outer elevational sketch of a segment of the central carrier of the staircase in Fig. 1, showing four support elements, Fig. 3 is a side view
