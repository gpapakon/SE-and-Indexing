<ABSTRACT>
The illumination of a photolithographic projection imager (10) is given a variable annular intensity profile by using diverging and counter diverging elements (35, 36) that are movable relative to each other in the illumination path. An upstream element (35) diverges the illumination into an annular configuration, the radius of which is set by the distance downstream to the counter diverging element (36). Convex and concave conical surfaces on the movable elements can accomplish this.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves illumination systems for
microlithographic projection imagers.Off-axis illumination in an annular configuration
has increased resolution and depth of focus for photolithographic
projection imagers imaging a mask or reticle
having dense lines and spaces and dense contacts. This is
explained in a paper entitled "0.25Âµm Lithography Using a
Deep-UV Stepper with Annular Illumination", authored by A.
Yen, W. N. Partlo, R. W. McCleary, and M. C. Tipton, and
presented at Microcircuit Engineering 92, Erlangen, Germany,
in June of 1992, and will be published in "Proceedings of
Microcircuit Engineering 92", Erlangen, Germany. The
advantage of annular illumination involves the diffractive
effects of a reticle having dense lines and spaces and dense
contacts, and an annular profile of illumination intensity is
especially advantageous when imaging a reticle that has a
region of densely packed features.The simplest way to provide annular illumination of
a mask or reticle in a photolithographic projection imager
has been with a mask arranged at the pupil of the illuminator
to block out the central region of the illumination and leave
an annular configuration of illumination intensity extending
around the masked out central portion. This has the serious
disadvantage of reducing the total illumination energy
available and thereby slowing down the imaging process. We have discovered a way of profiling the
illumination for a photolithographic projection imager to
produce an annular configuration of illumination intensity
without wasting illumination energy. Our preferred way of
doing this is also readily variable so that the radius of
the annular illumination profile can be varied quickly and
conveniently. Besides having this capacity, our illuminator
is also preferably able to produce illumination having a
standard, non-annular configuration. Moreover, our invention
implements these capabilities in a reliable and effective
way that an operator can control.According to the present invention there is
provided an illuminator for a photolitographic projection imager inluding a variable annular illumination intensity profiler,
said profiler comprising a pair of diverging and counter
diverging elements arranged on an illumination path
within said illuminator so that said diverging element
diverges the illumination into an annular configuration of
intensity and said counter diverging element counters the
divergence caused by said divergence element to give the
illumination an annular intensity profile the
