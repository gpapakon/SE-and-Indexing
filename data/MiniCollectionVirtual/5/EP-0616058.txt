<ABSTRACT>
System to control the quality of yarn in association with 
spinning machines or twisting frames, in which the yarn (12) 

cooperates with a yarn-guide loop (11) fitted solidly to an 
arm (14) which bears the yarn-guide loop (11) and which is 

secured to the structure of the machine, the system 
including at least one piezoelectric sensor (13) solidly 

fitted to the arm (14) bearing the yarn-guide loop (11), the 
piezoelectric sensor (13) being associated with a data 

processing and control means (17), which processes the 
signal generated by the piezoelectric sensor (13) and 

generates an electrical signal (16) of a sinusoidal type 
having an amplitude proportional to the tension of the yarn 

(12) and a frequency proportional to the speed of rotation 
of the balloon.

 
Device to control the quality of yarn, which is suitable to 

be integrated in the system of the claims hereinbefore and 
comprises an arm (14) secured to the structure of the 

machine and bearing a yarn-guide loop (11) solidly fixed to 
the arm (14), the arm (14) being solidly associated 

lengthwise with a piezoelectric sensor (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a system to control the quality of 
yarn and also a relative device, as set forth in the 
respective main claims. The system to control the quality of yarn according to the 
invention is applied advantageously to the textile field 
and, to be more exact, to single-twist or two-for-one 
twisting frames as well as ring spinning machines. The system to control the quality of yarn according to the 
invention enables anomalies to be detected and signalled in 
the yarn unwound from the twisting frame or spinning machine 
and the take-up of yarn on the yarn package or spindle to be 
halted. This invention can be applied to yarns made of any type of 
fibres, whether they be natural or manmade, continuous or 
discontinuous, of a staple length for wool or cotton. The invention can be employed on all existing textile 
machines and can be used for yarns of various materials and 
dimensions without being modified. In the spinning machines and twisting frames of the state 
of the art the yarn unwinding from the yarn package passes 
through a yarn-guide loop, which is generally located above 
and on the same axis as the spindle and has the task of 
limiting the balloon created by the centrifugal force 
generated by the rotation of the spindle. Devices have been disclosed which signal the breakage of 
the yarn with a view to providing a remote control of those 
machines. EP-A-0.436.204, which represents the closest prior art, discloses a device which includes loop-holder 
arms, all of which have a scanty rigidity with a 
vibrating part, the mass of which is out of proportion to 
the arm, so that the arm itself tends to start vibrating,  
 
and this situation could also lead to breakage. Moreover, the scanty consistency of the arms prevents them 
from keeping the loops aligned with the axis of the spindle 
inasmuch as they are unable to resist the strong stresses of 
the yarn passing through. In the case of two-for-one twisting frames various 
shortcomings may take place, such as the breakage of one of 
the yarns leading to the lack of the twisting operation, or 
else the union of undesired yarns whereby more yarns than 
those required are coupled together, or else the slipping of 
the spindle which causes a loss of twist in the yarn; or the 
belt setting the spindle in rotation may break with a 
resulting lack of twist in the yarn produced. The feeler devices of the state of the art do not enable 
these types of shortcomings to be identified and lead to the 
production of yarns of a low quality.

<CLAIMS>
Device to control the quality of yarn in association 
with spinning machines or twisting frames, in which the yarn 

(12) cooperates with a yarn-guide loop (11) fitted solidly 
to an arm (14), which bears the yarn-guide loop (11) and is 

secured to the structure of the machine, the system 
including a piezoelectric sensor (13) solidly fitted to the 

arm (14) bearing the yarn-guide loop (11), the piezoelectric 
sensor (13) being associated with a data processing and 

control means (17), which processes the signal generated by 
the piezoelectric sensor (13) and generates an electrical 

signal (16) of a sinusoidal type having an amplitude 
proportional to the tension of the yarn (12) and a frequency 

proportional to the speed of rotation of the balloon, the 
system being characterised in that the arm (14) includes a 

hollow (18) to which the piezoelectric sensor (13) is 
solidly fitted, the hollow (18) cooperating with a reduction 

of cross-section (43) to amplify the vibrations of the arm 
(14). 
Device according to Claim 1, in which, for controlling 
the speed of rotation, the data processing and control means 

(17) converts the electrical signal (16) into impulses which 
are counted and compared with a determined reference value, 

this comparison generating a speed differential signal (33) 
that conditions the speed of rotation. 
Device according to Claim 2, in which, when this speed 
differential signal (33) exceeds a given pre-set threshold, 

the data processing and control means (17) generates at 
least one actuation signal (35a, 35b). 
Device according to any of the preceding Claims, in 
which for controlling the tension of the yarn (12), the data 

processing and control means (17) converts the electrical 
signal (16) into voltage, this voltage being compared with a  

 
determined reference value so as to generate a voltage 

differential signal (42). 
Device according to Claim 4, in which, when the voltage 
differential signal (42) exceeds a given pre-set threshold, 

the data processing and control means (17) generates at 
least one actuation signal (35a, 35b). 
Device according to any preceding Claim, in which the 
hollow (18) is positioned longitudinally along a short 

extent. 
Device according to any preceding Claim, in which the 
arm (14) includes a covering and protective element (21) in 

correspondence with the piezoelectric sensor (13).
