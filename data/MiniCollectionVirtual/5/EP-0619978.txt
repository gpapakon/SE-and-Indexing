<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held vacuum cleaner (10) includes a 
housing, (12,26,28) a source of vacuum (16,18,20), a hose 

(22) removably connected to an intake section (32,38) of the 
housing, a rotatably driven brush (24,70) located at the 

intake section, and a system (102) automatically to stop the 
brush from being driven when the hose is disconnected from 

the intake section. The hose (22) is located on an exterior 
of the housing and connects the intake section (32,38) to 

the source of vacuum (16,18,20). The hose is flexible and 
expandable with a relatively compact, free-standing, curved 

shape when connected between the intake section and the 
source of vacuum, but can be expanded in general 

accordion-like fashion when the hose is removed from the 
intake section to expand to about four times its compact 

length. The system (102) to stop the brush automatically 
can also automatically re-engage (104,108,114,115,124) 

driving of the brush when the hose is reconnected to the 
intake section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner 
and, more particularly, to a vacuum cleaner with a hose that 
can be disconnected from an intake section and a rotating 
brush at the intake section that can be automatically 
disengaged when the hose is disconnected. U.S. Patent 4,955,106 discloses a vacuum cleaner 
with a hand-held hose that can be disconnected from a nozzle 
linkage to a brush set. U.S. Patent 4,748,714 discloses a 
vacuum cleaner with a manual belt shifting arrangement to 
shift a belt to an intermediate idler pulley. U.S. Patent 
4,581,787 discloses a manual switch to actuate a belt 
shifter in a floor nozzle. U.S. Patent 4,446,595 discloses 
a vacuum cleaner with a floor nozzle having a belt driven 
rotary brush. A belt switching member with a hook is used 
to move the belt. U.S. Patent 4,686,736 discloses a vacuum 
cleaner with an exterior disconnectable hose that conduits 
air from the lower body to the upper body. The present invention provides a vacuum cleaner 
having a housing and a source of vacuum. The vacuum cleaner 
comprises a hose and means for manually removing a first end 
of the hose from an intake section of the housing. The hose 
is located on an exterior of the housing and has its first 
end connected to the intake section of the housing and a 
second end connected to the source of vacuum. The hose is 
the only air flow pathway from the intake section to the 
source of vacuum and is comprised of flexible material that 
is expandable in length with a relatively compact, free 
standing, arch shape when connected to the intake section 
and source of vacuum. The means for manually removing the 
first end of the hose from the intake section is provided 
such that the first end of the hose can be repositioned from 
the intake section to a desired location by expanding and 
bending the hose. The present invention further provides a vacuum 
cleaner has a source of vacuum, a rotatable brush at an  
 
intake section, and means for rotating the brush including a 
drive transmission connected to the brush. The vacuum 
cleaner comprises a hose and means for automatically 
disengaging the transmission. The hose has a first end 
removably connected to the intake section and a second end 
connected to the source of vacuum. The means for 
automatically disengaging the transmission can do so upon 
removal of the first end of the hose from the intake section 
to thereby stop the brush from being driven while the hose 
is not connected to the intake section. The present invention
