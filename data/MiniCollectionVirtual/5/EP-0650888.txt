<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrically assisted pedal 
operated vehicle, in particular a bicycle, comprising a human 

power drive and an electrical drive system provided in parallel 
to each other, wherein an output of said electric drive system 

is controlled in compliance with changes in the output of the 
human power drive system. In order to control the electrical 

power assist an actual driving condition detection means 
including a h
uman power detection means and a vehicle speed 
detection means are provided in conjunction with a control means 

having a fail-safe circuit for discriminating a defective 
vehicle speed sensor of the vehicle speed detection means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically assisted pedal
operated vehicle, in particular a bicycle, comprising a human
power drive system and an electrical drive system provided in
parallel to each other, wherein an output of said electric drive
system is controlled in compliance with changes in the output of
the human power drive system and an actual driving condition
detecting means comprising a human power detection means and a
vehicle speed detection means.Such vehicles, for example, bicycles, which comprise a man power
drive system and an assistant electric drive system in parallel
to each other such as, for example, shown in EP-A2-0 517 224 or
shown in
post-published
European patent applications EP-A-0 569 954 (18.11.93) and
EP-A-0 590 674 (6.4.84) usually control the output of the
electric drive system in dependency of the change in the pedal
depressing force of the man power drive system. Accordingly,
the arrangement alleviates the burden on the human effort by
increasing the electric assist motor drive force in proportion
to the magnitude of the human power such as pedal depressing
force. Thus, the detection of the actual driving conditions of
the vehicle, in particular in terms of the pedal depressing
force (or under additional consideration of the vehicle speed)
the actual driving conditions were detected to derive a target
value for the desired electrical power assist.In order to detect the actual driving conditions of the vehicle
it is advantageous to detect also the vehicle speed in addition
to the detection of the pedal force of the rider.In such cases, for an appropriate control of the electrical
power assist the reliability of the vehicle speed sensor is very
important. For example, when the electrical connection of the
weak speed sensor becomes loose and disconnected during running
the sensor output will show an abnormal change in the vehicle
speed and this change can be discriminated as sensor anomaly. However, if the sensor output is zero from the beginning
because, for example, of breakage of the connection cord of the
vehicle sensor, it is impossible to discriminate whether the
vehicle speed is zero or the vehicle speed sensor has failed.It is an objective of the present invention to provide an
electrically assisted pedal operated vehicle as indicated above
wherein the condition of the vehicle speed sensor of the vehicle
speed detection means can be reliably evaluated, so that a
faulty vehicle speed sensor can be discriminated from a normal
operating one.In order to perform
