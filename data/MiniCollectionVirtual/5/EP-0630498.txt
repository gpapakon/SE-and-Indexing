A cache device (AM), comprising 

at least one request input/output (ESRQ) for receiving a 
request (REQ) for access to a data item stored in the main addressable 

memory (MP), the said request (REQ) comprising a main 
address of the said data item (AP) and, optionally, data (D); 
at least one main memory input/output (ESMP) connected to 
the main addressable memory (MP) for gaining access to the said 

desired data item of the main memory; 
a plurality of X memory banks (BCi), with i less than or 
equal to X and greater than 0, each having a number Li of lines 

capable of containing data, these lines being capable of being 
individually designated by a local address (ALi) in each bank 

(BCi); 
computing means (CAL) connected to the request input/output 
(ESRQ) and being capable of responding to the request (REQ) by 

connecting the address in the main memory (AP) contained in this 
address to a local address (AL) inside each of the banks (BCi), 

the line thus designated in the bank (BCi) being the only line 
of the said bank capable of containing the data item referenced 

by the address in the main memory; and 
loading means (CHA) connected to the main memory input/output 
(ESMP), for loading into the cache memory the data line 

of the main memory containing the desired data item when the 
latter is not present in the cache memory; 
 
characterized in that the computing means establish the said 

relation between the address in the main memory (AP) and the 
local address (ALi) in the bank (BCi) according to a predetermined 

formula (fi) associated with the said bank (BCi),
  
 

in that at least two of the predetermined formulas (fi) are 
distinctive according to the banks in question, and
 
in that the two banks in question are addressed separately 

according to their respective formula. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
formulas. predetermined according to the banks in question, are 

all distinct. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the predetermined formulas are equitable 

formulas. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the predetermined formulas are dispersive 

formulas. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the predetermined formulas are formulas 

which do not have any spatial locality.
