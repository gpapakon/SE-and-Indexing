<ABSTRACT>
In this method:   a) the logic semiconductor device can be operated clocked in a number of operating modes in dependence on the ambient temperature, b) one clock rate having in each case a different clock frequency is allocated to each operating mode, c) a temperature-dependent limit value having in each case a different limit temperature is allocated to each operating mode, and when this value is reached, the operating mode is changed, and d) the clock frequency is reduced when changing to an operating mode with a higher limit temperature and is increased when changing to an operating mode with a lower limit temperature.
