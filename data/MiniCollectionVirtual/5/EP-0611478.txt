<DESCRIPTION>
Radioactive waste has many forms, such as spent fuel 
from nuclear reactors, and contaminated glassware and 
spent ion exchange resins generated by medical and 
chemical laboratories. Radioactive components are often 
only a small percentage, by weight, of the total weight 
of such wastes. However, the half life of radioactive 
waste can be hundreds or thousands of years, thus 
requiring a permanent disposal solution. Typically, radioactive waste is disposed of by 
burial in specially prepared disposal sites, such as in 
land fills, which are lined or capped, or in deep 
underground mines. However, large volumes of radioactive 
wastes are difficult to contain. For example, landfills 
can develop leaks over time, thereby allowing radioactive 
components to leach from the landfill site and into 
municipal water supplies. Also, mines can become flooded 
and contaminate water which subsequently escapes. 
Further, suitable space for disposal of radioactive waste 
is limited. The rate at which radioactive waste is 
generated is also much greater than the rate at which new 
burial sites are becoming available. Therefore, a need exists for a method of reducing 
the volume of radioactive compositions, such as 
radioactive wastes, which include a radioactive 
component.  
 The present invention relates to a method for 
reducing the volume of a radioactive composition by 
separating a radioactive first component from a second 
component of the radioactive composition. The method includes directing the radioactive 
composition into a reaction zone. The reaction zone 
includes a molten bath, wherein oxidation of a component 
of the radioactive composition in the molten bath will 
cause separation of the radioactive first component from 
the second component. A first oxidizing agent is 
directed into the molten bath, whereby a component of the 
radioactive composition is oxidized, thereby causing 
separation of the radioactive first component from the 
second component. This invention has many advantages. For example, 
either the radioactive first component or the second 
component can be oxidized. In addition, the oxidized 
component and the other component can be separated by 
changing the solubility, polarity or density of either of 
the components or by allowing either of the components to 
volatilize and thereby escape from the molten bath. 
Also, the radioactive component can be dissolved in 
either a molten metal layer of the molten bath or a slag 
of the bath for subsequent disposal. Radioactive
