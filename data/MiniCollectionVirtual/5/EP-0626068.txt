<ABSTRACT>
The compounds of this invention are lanthanide chelates comprising three heterocyclic rings covalently coupled to each other (either one 2,6-pyridylene and two five-membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring moieties or two 2,6-pyridylene and one five-membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring moiety) and two chelating groups so seated that they together chelate the same lanthanide ion even in aqueous solutions. Optionally these lanthanide chelates also contain a reactive group for coupling to biologically active molecules. The new chelates of our invention find applications in those areas that are classical for lanthanide chelates. Moreover, these compounds are useful as probes in time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, cytometry, multilabelling techniques and process controls in industry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to new luminescent lanthanide
chelates comprising three unsaturated heterocyclic rings
covalently coupled to each other and additionally comprising
two chelating groups. This structure of three heterocyclic
rings is formed of one or two 2,6-pyridylene
moieties and five-membered unsaturated heterocyclic rings.The new chelates of our invention find applications in
those areas that are classical for lanthanide chelates and
known in the art. Moreover, these compounds are useful as
probes in time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, cytometry,
multilabelling techniques and process controls in industry.In immunoassays and DNA hybridization assays time-resolved
luminescence spectroscopy using lanthanide chelates is well
known (e.g. I.A.Hemmil√§, "Applications of Fluorescence in
Immunoassays" in J.D.Winefordner and I.M.Kolthoff, Eds.,
Chemical Analysis, Vol 117, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., USA,
1991 and the references therein). Stable luminescent
lanthanide chelates also have other applications, e.g.
fluorescence microscopy and cytometry. Because of their
paramagnetic properties, these lanthanide chelates are
useful as sensitive probes in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). The radioactive isotopes of the metals such as
indium and stable chelating ligands on the macromolecules 
offer possibilities to use the ligands of this invention in the
treatment of diseases such as cancer.Luminescent lanthanide chelates have previously been
proposed [macropolycycles: FR-A-2,570,703 (1986) and EP-B-321,353
(1988); phenols: US-A-4,670,572 (1987);
coumarines: US-A-4,801,722 (1989) and US-A-4,794,191
(1988); polypyridines: US-A-4,837,169 (1989), US-A-4,859,777
(1989), W090/08263 and W090/00550; aryl
pyridines: US-A-4,761,481 (1988) and W089/04826; ethynyl
pyridines: US-A-4,920,195 (1990); phenanthrolines: US-A-4,772,563
(1988); salicylates: M.P. Bailey, B.F. Rocks
and C. Riley, Analyst, 109, 1449 (1984)].Stable luminescent lanthanide chelates, whose energy
absorbing group comprises either one 2,6-pyridylene and
two five-membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring moieties,
or two 2,6-pyridylene moieties and one five-membered
unsaturated heterocyclic ring moiety coupled to each
other with a covalent bond between the carbon atoms, are
not known. Some basic structures comprising three
heterocyclic rings covalently coupled to each other
(including one or two pyridine rings) have been
synthesised (see e.g. V. Nair and K.H. Kim, J.
Heterocyclic Chem.13 (1976), 873; S. Kubota and H.
