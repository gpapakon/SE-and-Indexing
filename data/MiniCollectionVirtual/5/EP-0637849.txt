<ABSTRACT>
A case for electrical batteries (12) comprises a support element (18) which is solidly attached to the lid (16) in order to constitute an extractible module (19) housed in a casing (14) closed by a lid (16). Clamping clips (56, 58) are hinged symmetrically on the opposite side faces (52, 54) of the casing (14) in order to interact with holding cavities (68, 70) in the lid (16) so as to generate both uniform distribution of contact pressure over all the batteries (12), and a seal at the interface where the lid (16) is assembled with the upper edge of the casing (14). Application: power pack for a portable lamp (torch).

A case for housing electrical elements of a voltage supply source, notably 
batteries or accumulator cells, and comprising a hollow casing (14) containing a 

means (18) for supporting the electrical elements, a cover (16) sealing the casing 
(14), and an electrical interconnection circuit with a cable (46) passing through an 

orifice (49) of the casing (14) for supply of an external receiver,
 
characterized in that : 


a means (18) for supporting the electrical elements is secured to the cover (16) to 
form a module (19) in the form of an extractable cartridge, 
a first contact circuit (34) connects the electrical elements to one another in the 
vicinity of the cover (16), 
a second contact circuit (40) is arranged facing the first circuit (34) at the bottom of 
the casing (14), 
and means (11) for securing the cover (16) on the casing (14) comprise a pair of 
grips (56, 58), articulated symmetrically on the opposite side faces (52, 54) of the 

casing (14), each grip (56, 58) comprising a latching surface (60) designed to 
cooperate with a retaining part (68, 70) located at each end of the cover (16) so as 

to generate both a uniform contact pressure distribution over all the electrical 

elements, notably the batteries (12), and a tightness at the level of the assembly 
interface of the cover (16) and top edge of the casing (14). 
The case according to claim 1, characterized in that the removable support 
means (18) comprises adjacent compartments (20, 22, 24, 26) for positioning and 

securing the batteries (12), that the first contact circuit (34) is supported by the 
internal surface of the upper wall (36) of the support means (18) and extends 

transversely between the compartments (20, 22, 24, 26), and that the external 
surface of said wall is equipped with clipping means (38) designed to be clipped 

into conjugate orifices of the cover (16) to form said module (19). 
The case according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the bottom edge (47) is 
provided with a U-shaped groove (48) designed to cover the upper edge of the 

casing (14) with interposition of a seal (50). 
The case according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each grip (56, 58) is 
equipped with a gripping part (62) located opposite the latching surface (60), and  

 
an intermediate articulation zone (64) on a rod (66) mounted with limited rocking 

on a spindle borne by the corresponding side face (52, 54) of the casing (14). 
The case according to claim 2, characterized in that each compartment (20, 22, 
24, 26) of the support means (18) comprises a flexible tab (76) coming up against 

the lateral surface of the battery (12), said tab being arranged to position the 
battery (12) with a slight incline A with respect to the longitudinal axis (80) of the 

compartment so as to enhance ejection of the battery (12) when the module (19) is 
withdrawn. 
The case according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the casing 
(14) comprises a stop limiting the travel of the module 1(9 )to make the latter 

captive. 
The case according to either of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
second contact circuit (40) comprises flexible contact strips (40a, 40b, 40c, 40d) 

arranged on an insulating plate (42) positioned by guiding studs (44) on the bottom 
of the casing (14). 
The case according to claim 1, using electrical accumulator cells, wherein 
characterized in that the accumulator cells are mechanically secured to one 

another to form a monoblock assembly fixed directly to the cover (16), electrical 
connection of the accumulator cells being achieved by welding of connecting 

strips.
