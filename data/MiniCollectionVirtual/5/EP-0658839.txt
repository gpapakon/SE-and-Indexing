<ABSTRACT>
A computer system and method allows for precise control of a 
displayed three dimensional object about any one of three perpendicular 

axes. A procedure is called which defines three "hot spots" for the X, Y 
and Z axes. These hot spots are displayed at the termini of displayed X, 

Y and Z axes having an origin at a centroid of the 3D object. The user 
then drags and drops sliders for each one of the axes, connecting each 

slider to one of the hot spots. Once connected, the user may select a 
HIDE CONNECTION option and may further select a HIDE 3D AXES option so 

that the three sliders are displayed on the screen with the 3D object. 
Then by moving one or another of the sliders, the user may precisely 

rotate the 3D object about a corresponding axis to facilitate viewing of 
the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manipulation of objects 
displayed on a computer display screen. Three dimensional (3D) objects are generated by a variety of 
application programs ranging from business and scientific graphic 
charting applications to computer aided design (CAD) and illustrator 
applications. Any 3D object will require rotation in order to let the 
user view the object from all aspects. For example, if the object is a 3D 
business or scientific chart, some of the data represented by the chart 
will be obscured, and in order for the user viewing the chart to see all 
the data represented by the chart, the user needs to be able to rotate 
the chart about one or more axes. A computer generated 3D object produced 
by an illustrator or CAD application also needs to be rotated about the 
three cartesian X, Y and Z axes so that the designer will have a full 
appreciation of the shape and structure of the 3D object displayed on the 
computer screen. One approach which has been implemented in the past in two 
dimensional (2D) space is to use a technique which involved a mouse 
directed cursor. The cursor, when within certain limits of corners of a 
displayed object image bounding box, changes to a semicircular arc and, 
by pressing the mouse button and moving the mouse, the user could rotate 
the object in the 2D space. This technique has been applied to a 3D 
object depicted on the display, but since the depiction on the display is 
actually a two dimensional representation of the 3D object, it is 
difficult to control the rotation of the object. This is because mouse 
movement in two dimensional space does not map into three dimensional 
space precisely. More sophisticated illustrator and CAD applications require the 
user to input, either from the keyboard or by means of a pointing device, 
the coordinates of a view point in space. This approach is somewhat 
tedious and time consuming and often results in unpredictable results, 
requiring the user to input new coordinates until the desired viewing 
aspect is finally achieved on the computer display screen. Accordingly the invention provides in a first aspect a method of 
controlling the rotation of a computer displayed object about an axis on 
a computer display screen comprising the steps of: responding to a user  
 
selection of a displayed object followed by a user activation of a 
selection of a display axes by calling a procedure which defines a "hot 
spot" for at least one axis; responding to a user selection of a slider 
object

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling the rotation of a computer displayed object 
about an axis on a computer display screen comprising the steps of: 

   responding to a user selection of a displayed object followed by a 
user activation of a selection of a display axes by calling a procedure 

which defines a "hot spot" for at least one axis; 
   responding to a user selection of a slider object from a toolbox 

followed by a user drag and drop of the slider on the display screen by 
displaying the slider at a location in an application window on the 

display screen where the slider object is dropped by the user; 
   responding to a user activation of a connection procedure by 

generating a rubber banding line from the slider object to a pointing 
cursor moved by the user; and 

   responding to a user drop of the rubber banding line on a hot spot 
by changing the rubber banding line to an arrow to show that a connection 

has been made from the slider object to an axis corresponding to the hot 
spot. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising the step of 
responding to a movement of the slider object by the user by calling a 

redisplay method in the object to rotate the display of the object 
corresponding to a new viewing angle controlled by the slider object. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said computer 
displayed object is a three dimensional (3D) object. 
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein "hot spots" are defined for 
three axes and further comprising, for each additional axis, repeating 

the steps of: 
   responding to a user selection of a slider object from a toolbox 

followed by a user drag and drop of the slider on the display screen by 
displaying the slider at a location in an application window on the 

display screen where the slider is dropped by the user;
 

   responding to a user activation of a connection procedure by 
generating a rubber banding line from the slider to a pointing cursor 

moved by the user; and 
   responding to a user drop of the rubber banding line on a hot spot 

by changing the rubber banding line to an arrow to show that a connection 
has been made from the slider object to an axis corresponding to the hot 

spot. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 further comprising the step of 
responding to a movement of a slider object by the user by calling a 

redisplay method in the object to rotate the display of the object 
corresponding to new viewing angles controlled by the slider object. 
An apparatus for enabling a user to precisely control the rotation 
of a computer displayed three dimensional (3D) object about one or more 

axes on a computer display screen comprising: 
   selection means for responding to a user selection of a displayed 

3D object using a cursor control device, said selection means providing a 
visual feedback to the user upon selection of the 3D object and further 

responding to a user activation of a selection of a display axes by 
calling a procedure which defines a "hot spot" for at least one axis; 

   a toolbox database from which a user may select a slider object and 
drag and drop the slider on the display screen using the cursor control 

device, the slider being displayed at a location in an application window 
on the display screen where the slider object is dropped by the user; and 

   command means for responding to a user activation of a connection 
procedure by generating a rubber banding line from the slider object to a 

pointing cursor moved by the user using the cursor control device, said 
rubber banding line when dropped on a hot spot being changed to an arrow 

to show that a connection has been made from the slider object to an axis 
corresponding to the hot spot. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6 further comprising calculation 
means responding to a movement of the slider object by the user for 

calling a redisplay method in the object to rotate the display of the 
object corresponding to new viewing angles controlled by the slider 

object.
