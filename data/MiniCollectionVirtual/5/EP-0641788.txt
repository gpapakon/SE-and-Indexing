<ABSTRACT>
Object to provide an antipsychotic having a mechanism of action different from that of a dopamine autoreceptor agonist, 
that is, an antipsychotic having a specific affinity for a sigma receptor and not causing extrapyramidal disorder. Constitution: 

an 
aminoalkylthiazole derivative represented by general formula (I) and a salt thereof, wherein R¹ represents halogenated 

phenyl; 
R² and R³ may be the same or different from each other and each represents C₄ to C₁₀ alkyl; and n represents 2 or 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aminoalkylthiazole 
derivative which acts on a sigma receptor and exhibits an 
antipsychotic action. Antipsychotic drugs have been used not only in the 
treatment of schizophrenia but also in the treatment of 
troublesome behaviors (for example, aggressive actions, 
mental excitation, dromomania, delirium) caused by 
cerebrovascular disorders or senile dementia. However, 
conventional antipsychotic drugs are accompanied by severe 
extrapyramidal disorders as side effects, which results in a 
serious problem. In recent years, there have been made approaches for 
developing antipsychotic drugs from a viewpoint completely 
differing from the functional mechanism of the conventional 
drugs to thereby solve the above-mentioned problem. One of 
these approaches includes the use of a sigma receptor 
antagonist. A compound having a specific affinity for a 
sigma receptor, which is considered as an receptor 
participating in mental symptoms such as hallucinosis, 
exhibits an antipsychotic action without causing any 
extrapyramidal disorders.  There has been known talipexole (a compound described 
in JP-B-52-46236) as an antipsychotic drug having a thiazole 
skeleton. It is reported that this compound is a selective 
dopamine autoreceptor agonist and suppresses nerve ignition 
and biosynthesis and liberation of dopamine by stimulating 
the presynaptic autoreceptor, thus depressing the function of 
the dopamine nerve system, which closely relates to the 
outbreak of schizophrenia [European Journal of Pharmacology, 
166, 303 - 305 (1989); Acta Pharmaceut. Suec. Suppl., 1, 
154 - 164 (1983)]. However, it cannot be expected too much of talipexole 
of being highly effective on positive symptoms of 
schizophrenia, similar to other conventionally known 
selective dopamine autoreceptor agonists. In addition, the 
effect of talipexole on negative symptoms of this disease had 
not been definitely confirmed [Toshiya Inada et al., Shinkei 
Seishin Yakuri, 13, 75 - 77 (1990)]. In contrast thereto, the compound of the present 
invention has an affinity for a sigma receptor. Thus it is 
considered as being different from the dopamine autoreceptor 
agonists in functional mechanism. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
antipsychotic drug which is different from dopamine 
autoreceptor agonists in functional mechanism, namely, an 
antipsychotic drug having a specific affinity for a sigma 
receptor and causing no extrapyramidal disorder.  The present inventors have conducted extensive 
stu
