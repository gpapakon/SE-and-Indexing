<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of 2-amino-3-hydroxy 
acids which have many uses, such as serving as 
intermediates in the preparation of antibiotics. See, for 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,820,815; U.S. Patent No. 4,820,815; 
Mattingly et al., J. Org. Chem. 46:1557 (1981); Miller et al., J. 
Am. Chem. Soc. 102:7072 (1980); and Lotz, et al., 1993, J. 
Organic Chemistry 58:618. A number of methods for the preparation 
of 2-amino-3-hydroxy acids are known, however, most have one or 
more disadvantages. These include a lack of generality and poor 
stereochemical control. Enzymatic processes have some distinct advantages over chemical 
processes. For example, they are carried out in aqueous systems 
under mild conditions and frequently are stereoselective. The 
enzyme employed in the process of this invention is SHMT. 
European Patent Publication 0460883A2, published December 11, 
1991, described a process for obtaining 2-amino-3-hydroxy acids by 
a SHMT-catalyzed condensation of certain aldehydes with glycine. 
This process comprised incubating glycine and an aldehyde with 
SHMT in an aqueous medium at a pH of 7.0 to 8.0 and a temperature 
of about 30°C to 55°C. U.S. Patent No. 5,102,792 describes a process for the 
production of L-erythro-serine derivatives by a SHMT-catalyzed 
aldol condensation of glycine and an aldehyde. The process 
employs an extractive process using organic solvents in 
conjunction with the aldol condensation reaction to provide 
diastereomeric specificity. However, as described by Saeed and Young, 1992, Tetrahedron 
48(12) :2507-2514, SHMT-catalyzed condensation reactions at batch 
preparative scale which did not employ a continuous extraction 
process of the product provided low stereoselectivity. The process of the present invention allows SHMT-catalyzed 
aldol condensation reactions to proceed in high yield and high 
diastereomeric specificity directly, without the need for  
 
continuous and coupled extraction. The elimination of water 
immiscible solvents as extractive agents enhances the 
environmental safety of the process and allows a simple batch or 
fed-batch mode operation. The conditions of the process of the 
present invention are amenable to safe, practical, and economic 
manufacture of L-erythro-2-amino-3-hydroxy acids at large scale. The invention provides a process for preparing a 2-amino-3-hydroxy 
acid of the formula 
wherein R is C₃-C₆ alkenyl; C₂-C₆ aldehydo; C₃-C₆ alkynyl; C₂-C₆ 
alkyl substituted by esterified carboxy, C₁-C₆ alkoxy,
