<ABSTRACT>
Known separating circuits contain an amplitude-selective stage and a flywheel stage used for suppressing noise. Adequate noise suppression requires a flywheel stage which introduces a relatively high constancy with time in order to eliminate the influence of individual synchronisation pulses which are missing or are wrongly located in time. A fast adaptation to changes in frequency and phase of the line synchronisation pulses, for example in the case of a signal from a video recorder, on the other hand, requires a short time constant. Between these two contrary requirements, a compromise has to be found in practice or the time constant has to be switched depending on the type of signal. It is the object to create a synchronisation signal separating circuit which contains a flywheel stage for suppressing noise but, nevertheless, rapidly adapts itself to changes in frequency and phase of the line synchronisation pulses offered. The video signal (V) is supplied to a control circuit (6) which, by evaluating the position of line synchronisation pulses (Z) of several successive lines in time supplies a control signal (Us). If the phase of several successive line synchronisation pulses (Z) is offset compared with the previous line raster when a disturbance begins, the flywheel stage (5) of the separating stage (3) is disabled for a short time so that the separating stage (3) can rapidly adapt itself to the new phase. Particularly for television receivers in the processing of signals from a video recorder.

Synchronising signal separating circuit for a television 
receiver including an amplitude selective stage and a flywheel 

stage which introduces a response time into the separation 
that serves for suppressing disturbances, characterised by the 

following features: 

a) a delay circuit (2) is located in the path of the video 
signal (V) to the separating stage (3), 
b) prior to the delay stage (2), the video signal (V) is 
applied to a control circuit (6) which generates a control 

signal (Us) for the following two cases of disturbance by 
evaluating the time positions of line synchronising pulses (Z) 

of a plurality of successive lines 
 
just one line synchronising pulse (Z1) is missing within the 

line raster, or, it has an incorrect time position, and the 
following line synchronising pulses are then correct once more 

with respect to the line raster, the whole line raster 
following a disturbance is displaced by one time unit (ΔT) 

from the beginning of the disturbance.
 
   c) in the second case of disturbance, the control signal 

(Us) temporarily makes the flywheel stage (5) inoperative. 
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, 
the delay time of the delay stage (2) amounts to a plurality 

of lines. 
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, 
the delay stage (2) is constructed as a digital store. 
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, 
the rendering inoperative of the flywheel stage (5) is  

 
effected by reducing a time constant which is effective in the 

separating stage (3). 
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, 
the control circuit (6) contains a second separating stage 

(9), which incorporates a flywheel stage and is controlled by 
the signal, and a phase comparison stage (8) which evaluates 

the time position between the supplied line synchronising 
pulses and the line synchronising pulses generated therefrom 

in the second separating stage (9) and generates the control 
signal (Us) therefrom. 
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, a 
store (10) for the phase deviations that have been determined 

in terms of number, magnitude and direction is connected to 
the phase comparison stage (8). 
Circuit in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that, a 
counter, which counts the phase deviations between the line 

synchronising pulses (Z) the successive lines that have been 
determined in the phase comparison stage (8) and generates the 

control signal (Us) upon reaching a predetermined counter 
state (3), is connected to the output of the phase comparison 

stage (8).
