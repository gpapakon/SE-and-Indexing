<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus is provided comprising image 
data reading means (31) capable of reading arbitrary image 

data to be recorded on a recording medium, which already 
has an original document image reproduced thereon. Holding 

means (43) are provided for storing the arbitrary image 
data read by the image data reading means (31). This 

arbitrary image data is recorded onto the recording medium 
by additional data recording means (9), which are provided 

in addition to the original document recording means (2, 3, 
4, 8). The image forming apparatus also includes output 

order reversing means (32) for reversing the order of 
output of the arbitrary additional data, depending on the 

orientation of the original image already reproduced onto 
the recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to image 
forming apparatuses such as a copying machine, a printer 
or a facsimile, and more particularly, to an image forming 
apparatus capable of recording additional information such 
as desired characters or marks in addition to a document 
image. For example, copying machines conventionally known 
comprise one capable of recording additional information 
such as the date and the name of a company in addition to 
an inherent document image (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Gazette Nos. 258575/1985 and 53665/1986). The conventional copying machine capable of recording 
additional information uses a variety of keys of an 
operation panel so as to input additional information. In 
addition, it is so constructed that a plurality of 
additional information are previously stored in a memory 
and desired additional information is called by a function 
key or the like of the operation panel. In a system for inputting additional information and 
calling additional information in a memory by a key  
 
operation, however, only particular additional information 
such as numerals and characters can be inputted and 
desired additional information is only selected from 
additional information previously stored. Accordingly, it 
is impossible to input a figure having an arbitrary shape, 
for example, a logotype of a company or a seal of a user. 
as additional information and record the same. Furthermore, an additional information recording 
device provided in the conventional copying machine is 
constructed to have an ink sheet and a thermal print head. 
However, a medium-speed or high-speed type copying 
machine which cannot make so low the speed at which paper 
is conveyed has the disadvantage in that it is difficult 
to clearly record additional information. Therefore, a primary object of the present invention 
is to provide an image forming apparatus capable of 
inputting arbitrary additional, information including 
graphic data. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
an image forming apparatus capable of clearly recording 
additional information. The image forming apparatus according to the present 
invention has, for example, a scanner for reading 
arbitrary additional information. Arbitrary data read by  
 
the scanner, for example, a particular logotype 
or seal is recorded as additional data on a recording 
medium on which a document image is recorded. Furthermore, in the present invention, an additional 
information recording device is provided
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus comprising: 
document image recording means (2, 3, 4, 8) for 

reading an image of a document disposed on an original 
setting place to reproduce the image on a recording 

medium; 
image data reading means (31) capable of reading 

arbitrary image data other than said document image; 
holding means (43) for storing the image data read by 

said image data reading means (31); 
additional data recording means (9) for recording the 

image data read by said image data reading means (31) 
as additional data on the recording medium on which 

the document image is recorded by said document image 
recording means (2, 3, 4, 8); and 

output order reversing means (32) for reversing the 
order of outputting the additional data in response to 

a state of the document image recorded on said 
recording medium when the image data held by said 

holding means (43) is output to said additional data 
recording means (9).

further comprising: 

display means (50) for displaying the image data read 
by said image data reading means (31); and

 
data compressing means (43) for compressing the data 

read by said image data reading means (31) to apply 
the same to said display means (50). 
The image forming apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said additional data recording means (9) is
