<ABSTRACT>
An optical device has an objective lens system 
including at least two lens groups (at least one of 

which is shiftable in the optical axis direction), a 
vibration detector for detecting a vibration of the 

objective lens system, and outputting a signal 
indicating the vibration of the objective lens system, 

a vibration compensation means arranged at a position 
other than the position of the most-object side lens 

group of the objective lens system, and at least one 
shift amount detector for detecting the shift amount, 

in the optical axis direction, of the shiftable lens of 
the objective lens system, and outputting a signal

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
preventing a vibration of an image of an optical system 
caused by a vibration and, more particularly, to an 
anti-vibration optical device suitable for a camera, a 
video camera, a telescope, and the like. In recent years, as disclosed in USP 
No. 5,270,857, in a zoom lens system in which a given 
lens group in the zoom lens system is shifted in a 
direction perpendicular to the optical axis to perform 
an anti-vibration operation, an anti-vibration optical 
system for, when a vibration occurs, controlling the 
compensation amount for compensating for the vibration 
in accordance with a zooming state of the zoom lens 
system is proposed. However, when the lens group (to be referred to as 
an anti-vibration lens group hereinafter) to be shifted 
in an anti-vibration operation for compensating for a 
vibration is not arranged at the most object side, an 
ideal shift amount of the anti-vibration lens group for 
an identical vibration angle varies between an infinity 
focusing state and a near-distance focusing state. For  
 
this reason, when an anti-vibration operation in the 
near-distance focusing state is performed by a 
vibration compensation amount proposed in USP 
No. 5,270,857, a sufficient anti-vibration effect 
cannot often be obtained. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an anti-vibration optical device which can 
realize an optimal vibration compensation state in 
accordance with a change in state of an objective lens 
system due to a zooming operation, a focusing 
operation, and the like. An anti-vibration optical device according to the 
present invention comprises an objective lens system 
having at least two lens groups, vibration detection 
means for detecting a vibration, vibration compensation 
means arranged at a position other than that of the 
most-object side lens group of the objective lens 
system, at least a portion of the objective lens system 
being shifted in the optical axis direction of the 
objective lens system, at least one shift amount 
detection means for detecting a shift amount of the 
shiftable lens group of the objective lens system, and 
calculation means for calculating a drive amount of the 
vibration compensation means on the basis of a signal 
from the shift amount detection means and a signal from 
the vibration detection means.  The vibration compensation means drives a lens 
group other than the most-object side lens group of the 
objective lens system to decenter it in a direction 
almost
