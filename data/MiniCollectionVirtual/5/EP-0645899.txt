<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication apparatus is provided,
in which the linearity during a small output power of a

radio-frequency power amplifier can be maintained as
during a large output power. The input signal power to

a radio-frequency power amplifier (11) is decreased by
an attenuator (32) during a small power output. The

resulting downward trend of the transmission signal
power is compensated for by increasing the gain of the

radio-frequency amplifier circuit (11) through a
transmission power control circuit (14). Under this

condition, the radio-frequency power amplifier (11) is
made operable in a linear region of the transistor in

the same manner as during a large power output. As a
result, the linearity of the amplifier is guaranteed

over the whole operating range of the transmission
power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile 
communication apparatus and method, or more in 
particular to a mobile radio communication apparatus 
employing a digital modulation scheme requiring a 
comparatively wide range of output power and the 
linearity of a radio-frequency amplification section. 
The invention specifically relates, for example, to a 
mobile communication technique effectively applicable to 
automobile telephones and portable radio telephones 
(hereinafter referred to simply as "handy telephone" or 
"the portable phone") used in a cellular telephone 
system. The portable phone is based on the technique 
for restricting the transmission power in such a manner 
that the radio wave is prevented from propagating to an 
excessively far point and for using the same frequency 
at a far point, i.e., in other cells in order to permit 
servicing as many subscribers as possible within the 
finite frequency resources allocated to the system. In 
this portable phone, the magnitude of transmission 
output power is determined by the distance and the 
electrical communication environment between the 
transmitter and the receiver. More specifically, 
explanation will be made with reference to an example of  
 
the cellular telephone system emphasizing a given base 
station as shown in Fig. 10. In the communications 
between the base station 103 and a portable phone set 
101 similar to each other in the electrical 
communication environment, the transmission power is 
reduced as needed. In the case of a portable phone set 
102 which is located at a long distance from the base 
station 103, on the other hand, the communication power 
between the base station 103 and the portable phone 102 
is increased. As a result, the control of the 
transmission output power within the range of about 20 
dBm, for example, is required for the transmitters 101, 
102. The level of transmission power used by the 
transmitters 101, 102 for transmission is selected by 
the signal, i.e., the instruction on the transmission 
power information contained in the received signal sent 
from the base station. This control of transmission 
power is intended to minimize the effect of 
unnecessarily large transmission power on the devices 
used for communications in other cells with a relatively 
short distance between the transmitter and the receiver, 
to minimize the consumption of the power battery of the 
transmitter due to unduly large transmission power and 
to thereby lengthen the communication time with a 
limited battery
