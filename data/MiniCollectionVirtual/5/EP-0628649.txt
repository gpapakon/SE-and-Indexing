<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing a face-to-face pile 
fabric in which in each case a first weft thread (6) is 

provided in the top fabric (TF) and the bottom fabric 
(BF) next to two second and third weft threads (7, 8) 

located one above the other, and in which in each case 
three weft threads are inserted simultaneously, each warp 

thread system comprising binder warp threads (3, 4) and 
a tension warp thread (9, 10), and pile-forming pile warp 

threads (11-14) interlacing in accordance with a three-pick 
weave. The quality of the fabrics (TF, BF) is 

improved by: 

in each case forming pile on the first weft thread 
(6) which is provided on the back of the second (7) 

and third weft thread (8); 
binding in the dead pile warp thread (11-16) 
distributed over both fabrics (TF, BF); 
in each case forming pile on the third weft thread 
(8) located on the back while a pile thread which 

starts forming pile or finishes forming pile is 
first interlaced with a third weft thread before it 

starts forming pile or is bound in; 
binding in the first weft thread (6) by means of 
binder warp threads (3, 4) in each case in a separate 

opening (49', 50', ...; 49'', 50'', 49''', 
50''',...); 
in each case forming pile on the first weft thread 
(6) which is not provided on the back of the fabrics 

(TF, BF); 
providing two tension warp threads (9, 10); (9', 
10') in each warp thread system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
manufacturing a face-to-face pile fabric, in which
a top fabric and a bottom fabric are formed by
providing successive groups of three weft threads for
each fabric, so that, in every group, a first weft
thread extends next to a second and a third weft
thread, which are located one above the other, by
providing, for each fabric, adjacent warp thread
systems having two binder warp threads which cross a
number of times so as to form successive openings
between their points of intersection, through which
extends in each case a group of weft threads, and by
binding a tension warp thread into each fabric in each
of the warp thread systems;in each case three weft threads are inserted
simultaneously;in accordance with a three-pick weave, in each of the
warp thread systems at least one pile-forming pile
warp thread is interlaced with a weft thread, alternately
in the top fabric and in the bottom fabric; and all pile-forming pile warp threads between both
fabrics are cut through in order to obtain two
separate pile fabrics.  Such a method is known from FR-2.182.790.According to this known method, the pile-forming
pile warp threads are in each case interlaced with the
third weft threads located on the back of the fabrics
(except in case of a change of pile).In each case, two weft threads are inserted
simultaneously into one fabric and one weft thread into
the other fabric, a weaving loom thus inserting six weft
threads in two working cycles.According to this method, the dead pile warp threads
(i.e. the pile warp threads or parts of pile warp threads
which do not form pile) are alternately bound into the
top fabric and into the bottom fabric in the successive
warp thread portees (a warp thread portee consists of a 
warp thread system of the top fabric and a warp thread
system of the bottom fabric, whose binder warp threads,
tension warp threads and pile warp threads are located
one above the other).After the face-to-face fabric has been cut through,
each fabric comprises successive rows of pile loops which
have been interlaced with corresponding weft threads.
These pile loops have upright pile sides. In order to
achieve perfect pile formation, these pile sides have to
extend at right angles to the plane of the backing fabric
(which comprises weft threads, binder warp threads and
tension warp threads). If this is not the case (i.e. with
a so-called drawn pile), a fabric of inferior quality is
obtained. As a result of a drawn pile, mixing contours
may occur in the

Method for manufacturing a face-to-face pile fabric,
in which


a top fabric (TF) and a bottom fabric (BF) are formed
by providing successive groups of three weft threads

(6, 7, 8) for each fabric (TF, BF), so that, in every
group, a first weft thread (6) extends next to a

second (7) and a third weft thread (8), which are
located one above the other, by providing, for each

fabric (TF, BF), adjacent warp thread systems having
two binder warp threads (3, 4) which cross a number of

times so as to form successive openings between their
points of intersection, through which extends in each

case a group of weft threads (6, 7, 8), and by binding
a tension warp thread (9, 10) into each fabric (TF,

BF) in each of the warp thread systems;
in each case three weft threads are inserted
simultaneously;
in accordance with a three-pick weave, in each of the
warp thread systems at least one pile-forming pile

warp thread (11-14) is interlaced with a weft thread
(6), alternately in the top fabric (TF) and in the

bottom fabric (BF);
and all pile-forming pile warp threads (11-14) between
both fabrics (TF, BF) are cut through;

characterized in that the first weft threads (6) of
successive groups extend in a first plane, which lies on

the back relative to a second and third plane in which,
respectively, the second (7) and third weft threads (8)

of these successive groups extend; in that the pile-forming
pile warp threads (11-14) are in each case interlaced

with a first weft thread (6); and in that dead pile
warp threads (11-16) are bound in in each warp thread

portee, distributed over top fabric (TF) and bottom
fabric (BF).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that
a pile warp thread (11-13) whose pile-forming part 

changes into a bound-in part is interlaced with a first
weft thread (6) before it is bound in, and/or in that a

pile warp thread (11-13) whose bound-in part changes into
a pile-forming part is interlaced with a first weft

thread (6) before it starts forming pile.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the tension warp threads (9, 10) extend between said

first (6) and third weft threads (8).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that
a second tension warp thread (9', 10') is bound in in

each warp thread system between the second (7) and third
weft threads (8) so that only the second weft threads (7)

extend on the pile side of the second tension warp thread
(9', 10').
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a tension warp thread (9, 10), (9',

10') on either side of the pile warp threads (11-16) of
each warp thread system.
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that at least one of the tension warp threads (9, 10)

(9', 10') of a warp thread system is used as support for
a weft insertion means (21), (22), (23).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the dead pile warp threads (11-16)

are bound in between the second (7) and third weft
threads (8) and extend on the pile side of the fabric

(TF, BF) relative to the first weft threads (6).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, in order to effect a pile change

- at a particular pick in the face-to-face fabric -
between a first pile warp thread, which is to be bound

into one fabric (TF or BF) after the pile change, and a
second pile warp thread which was bound into the other fabric

(BF or TF) before the pile change, the marriage of these
pile warp threads between top fabric (TF) and bottom

fabric (BF) is prevented by either binding the first pile
warp thread into the pile fabric (TF, BF) two picks

earlier than said particular pick or by allowing the
second pile warp thread to start forming pile two picks 

later than said particular pick.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that alternately, a second (7) and third

weft thread (8) are provided in the bottom fabric (BF)
and a first weft thread (6) in the top fabric (TF), and

a second (7) and third weft thread (8) in the top fabric
(TF) and a first weft thread (6) in the bottom fabric,

respectively, using a triple weft insertion means.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the second (7) and/or the

third weft thread (8) of each group is (are) thinner than
the first weft thread (6) of that group.
