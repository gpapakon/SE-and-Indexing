<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method 
for retaining the antimicrobial activity of the 

byproducts of growth of microorganisms during storage. 
In the method, a pasteurized low fat or skim milk 

substrate is provided. The substrate is inoculated with 
an 
S. lactis
 culture. The substrate is then fermented to 
cause growth of the culture and the release of metabolic 

byproducts, including nisin, from the culture. The 
fermented substrate is loaded into a container. The 

headspace of the container is then flushed with a 
quantity of an inert gas in excess of the amount required 

to displace all of the ambient air in the headspace. 
In an important embodiment of the invention, a 
small amount of a CO₂ producing chemical, such as calcium 

carbonate, sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, is 
mixed into the fermented substrate. The CO₂ producing 

chemical has the effect of both stabilizing the 
antimicrobial activity of the cultured substrate and 

aiding in the release of nisin from the cells produced 
during fermentation of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the 
stabilization of the bactericidal activity produced in 
skim milk during culturing of the skim milk with an S. lactis 
culture. More particularly, the present invention is 
directed to preserving the bactericidal activity of 
cultured skim milk during storage of the cultured skim 
milk. It is known that certain S. lactis cultures produce 
nisin as a byproduct of metabolism during fermentation of 
a skim milk or low fat milk substrate with the S. lactis 
culture. Nisin is an antimicrobial substance which has 
known food preservative use. Nisin has the property of 
inhibiting the growth of certain Gram-positive bacteria, 
but not Gram-negative bacteria or yeasts or molds. A 
further important property of nisin lies in the ability 
of nisin to prevent the outgrowth of germinated bacterial 
spores. Skim milk cultured with S. lactis has an appearance 
and taste similar to cultured buttermilk. The taste 
differs somewhat since commercial cultured buttermilk is 
produced with a mixture of cultures including S. lactis, S. 
cremoris and L. cremoris. Fresh skim milk cultured with S. lactis 
can be used in food products to provide bactericidal 
protection. Such food products include high moisture 
cheese sauces and high moisture dressings, such as 
pourable dressings. The cultured skim milk generally has 
a nisin activity which is consistent and which is in the 
range of 1400-1600 nisin equivalent units/gram. The 
consistent nisin activity can be used to calculate 
precisely the level of nisin activity provided by the 
cultured skim milk. Since this level is generally in the  
 
range of about 6 to 10 ppm in the product, it is 
necessary that the nisin activity be stabilized and not 
undergo any diminution during storage. A problem arises in that most plants which are 
suitable for producing food products containing cultured 
skim milk, such as a plant designed for producing salad 
dressings, do not have facilities for culturing skim milk 
in large quantities. Consequently, the skim milk is 
cultured at a plant suitable for that purpose and is then 
transported to the plant making the final product. The 
distances over which such transportation occur are often 
great and the cultured skim milk may require storage for 
several days prior to being used. During storage, the 
nisin activity may be reduced by more than 30%. Such 
reduction in nisin activity is detrimental to shelf life 
of any product in which the cultured skim milk is used.
