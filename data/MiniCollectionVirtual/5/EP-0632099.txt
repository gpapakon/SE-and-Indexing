<ABSTRACT>
An organopolysiloxane for modifying curable 
organic and silicone compositions is disclosed, said 

organopolysiloxane having the general formula 

wherein each R¹ is a monovalent group independently 
selected from hydrocarbon groups and halogenated 

hydrocarbon groups; R² is selected from hydrogen atom, 
monovalent hydrocarbon groups and halogenated 

hydrocarbon groups; R³ is selected from 
epoxy-functional organic groups, alkoxysilylalkyl 

groups and alkyl groups having at least 6 carbon atoms; 
a is zero or a positive number; b is a positive number; 

c is a positive number; a/c has a value of zero to 
<
4; 
b/c has a value of 0.05 to 4; and 


(a + b)/c 
 
 has a value 

of 0.2 to 4, with the proviso that neither R¹ nor R² is 
an alkenyl group and that organopolysiloxane has in its 

molecule at least one epoxy-functional organic group 
and at least one said alkyl group having at least 6 

carbons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
organopolysiloxane and a method for its preparation. 
The present organopolysiloxane is composed of the 
monofunctional siloxane unit (M unit) and 
tetrafunctional siloxane unit (Q unit) and contains in 
each molecule at least 1 epoxy-functional organic group 
and at least 1 alkyl group having at least 6 carbon 
atoms. The present invention also provides a method 
for the preparation of this organopolysiloxane. Among the various organopolysiloxanes known 
in the art, MQ organopolysiloxanes composed of 
monofunctional siloxane units (M units) and 
tetrafunctional siloxane units (Q units) (refer to JP-A 
61-195129 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,531) are used as a 
starting material for varnishes and pressure-sensitive 
adhesives because of their heat resistance. More 
recently, hydroxyphenyl-containing MQ 
organopolysiloxane has been taught by JP-A 1-292036 
(U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,921). Chloromethyl-containing MQ 
organopolysiloxane has similarly been taught by JP-A 2-153935. 
We have already proposed MQ 
organopolysiloxanes that contain epoxy-functional 
organic and or alkoxysilylalkyl groups (JP-A 5-105758 & EP-A-541988 
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,843), and MQ organopolysiloxanes 
that contain epoxy-functional organic groups and 
diorganopolysiloxane residues JP-A 3-331409 (U.S. Pat. 
No.5,283,309). However, MQ organopolysiloxane in which 
epoxy-functional organic and C≥6 alkyl groups are 
present on the monofunctional siloxane unit (M unit) 
silicon has heretofore been unknown. The present invention introduces 
organopolysiloxanes that are composed of  
 
monofunctional siloxane units (M units) and 
tetrafunctional siloxane units (Q units) and that 
contain in each molecule at least 1 epoxy-functional 
organic group and at least 1 alkyl group having at 
least 6 carbon atoms. The present invention also 
provides a method for the preparation of these 
organopolysiloxanes. The organopolysiloxane in our invention has 
the general formula given below and contains in each 
molecule as groups R3 at least one epoxy-functional organic 
group, at least one alkyl group having at least 6 carbon atoms 
and at least one alkoxysilylalkyl group. 
 
R1 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, excluding alkenyl 
groups; R2 is hydrogen atom, a monovalent hydrocarbon 
group, or a halogenated hydrocarbon group, excluding 
alkenyl groups; R3 is a group selected from epoxy-functional 
organic groups, alkoxysilylalkyl groups, or 
C≥6 alkyl groups; a is zero or a positive number; b is 
a positive number; c is a
