<ABSTRACT>
An optic sensor system comprising an optic sensor 
(10), a pair of photoelectric devices (12,14) and a pair 

of optic fibers (16,18) that transmit light respectively 
between the photoelectric devices (12,14) and the sensor 

(10). The photoelectric devices (12,14) serve as both a 
source of input light for the sensor (10) as well as a 

light detector for the light returned from the sensor (10). 
A control circuit is used to switch the photoelectric 

devices (12,14) on and off, thus determining the periods 
of time that each operates as a source or detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optic sensor system, comprising at
least one interrogatable optic sensor, the at least one sensor
having two bi-directional optical ports whereby interrogating
light received by the at least one sensor through either port
exits through the other port with a characteristic dependent on
a parameter sensed by the at least one sensor, and a plurality
of light source/detector devices connected to the optical ports,
each device being switchable between a condition in which it acts
as a light source and a condition in which it acts as a light
detector.The invention also relates to an optic sensor method, for
interrogating at least one interrogatable optic sensor, the at
least one sensor having two bi-directional optical ports whereby
interrogating light received by the at least one sensor through
either port exits through the other port with a characteristic
dependent on a parameter sensed by the at least one sensor,
comprising the step of using a plurality of light source/detector
devices connected to the optical ports, and switching each device
between a condition in which it acts as a light source and a
condition in which it acts as a light detector.Such a system and method are shown, for example, in US-A-5 149
962. As shown therein, two light source/detector devices are
associated with a single sensor, with one device being connected
to one of the ports of the sensor and the other device being
connected to the other port of the sensor. Therefore, adopting
this configuration in a multi-sensor system would mean that there
would always be twice as many light source/detector devices as
there are sensors. Such a system would be expensive and complex,
and the invention aims to deal with this problem. An alternative 
configuration is shown in US-A-5 149 962 in which the light
source/detector device comprises a separate light source and a
separate detector which are respectively connected to the two
ports of the sensor, the connections being repeatedly reversed
by means of an optical switch. However, readily available
optical switches can only operate at relatively low frequencies
and thus do not provide a satisfactory solution to the problem.Other optic sensor systems, not of the type firstmentioned above,
are disclosed in US-A-5051578 and GB-A-2139346. US-A-5051578
discloses a fiber optic monitoring system having a single light
source (or two light sources that are combined) for a plurality
of transducers arranged for uni-directional interrogation. The
system includes a respective
