<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly for printed circuit boards 
comprises a first connector part and a second connector part. 

The first connector part has a first housing of insulating 
material comprising a bottom and two opposite side walls and 

male contact elements mounted in the bottom of the housing 
arranged in rows and columns. The second connector part has a 

second housing of insulating material adapted to be inserted 
into the first housing with an insertion side and female 

contact elements mounted in the housing arranged in a 
corresponding manner in rows and columns. A ground contact 

plate is provided at both sides of each at least one column of 
female contact elements, wherein the ground contact plates at 

the insertion side of the second housing are projecting out of 
said housing along a distance substantially corresponding with 

the thickness of the bottom of the first housing. Slots are 
provided in the bottom of the first housing for receiving the 

ground contact plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector assembly for 
printed circuit boards, comprising a first connector part with 
a first housing of insulating material and having a bottom and 
two opposite side walls and with male contact elements mounted 
in the bottom of the housing and arranged in rows and columns 
and a second connector part with a second housing of 
insulating material and adapted to be inserted into the first 
housing with an insertion side and with female contact 
elements mounted in the housing and arranged in a 
corresponding manner in rows and columns. Such a connector assembly is disclosed for example in 
EP-A-0 446 980. In this known connector assembly the second 
connector part comprises a plurality of outer conductors each 
substantially enclosing in circumferential direction at least 
one female contact element operating as signal contact and 
each contacting the adjacent ground contacts of the 
corresponding signal contact of the first connector part. In 
this manner a correct signal transmission can be obtained also 
at high bit rates of the signals to be transmitted. Further, 
outer conductors can also be provided in this known connector 
assembly for the male contact elements operating as signal 
contacts. Although an optimal signal transmission can be 
realized with this known connector assembly also at high bit 
rates, the construction is less suitable for applications, 
wherein the signal contacts must be very closely spaced one 
from the other. The invention aims to provide a connector assembly of 
the abovementioned type, wherein an optimal signal 
transmission at high bit rates is possible and wherein the 
signal contacts can be closely spaced and the construction can 
be simplified. To this end the connector assembly according to the 
invention is characterized in that a ground contact plate is 
provided at both sides of each at least one column of female 
contact elements, wherein the ground contact plates at the 
insertion side of the second housing are projecting out of 
said housing along a distance substantially corresponding with  
 
the thickness of the bottom of the first housing, and in that 
slots are provided in the bottom of the first housing for 
receiving the ground contact plates. In this manner a connector assembly is obtained, 
wherein the second connector part is provided with ground 
contact plates operating in the coupled position of the 
connector assembly as a shielding for the columns of contact 
elements in both connector parts. By means of a suitable
