<ABSTRACT>
A method for managing resource usage within a cellular
communications system (10) having at least one satellite (12)

and, capable of communicating with the satellite(s) (12), at
least one controlling station (28) and multiple ground terminals

(26). The controlling station (28) predicts (372, 380) system
communication traffic and operating capabilities for a future

period; generates (216) a system plan (250) and an individual
operational plan (270-30n) for each satellite (12) based on the

prediction; distributes (222) each individual operational plan
(270-30n) to each corresponding satellite (12); monitors (226)

execution of the system plan (250) during the future period to
determine (228) whether the plan is operating acceptably and

when the plan is not operating acceptably (228), generates (216)
a new plan, or portion thereof, to alleviate the unacceptable

operation; and repeats the foregoing steps for additional future
periods. Each satellite (12) receives (502), stores (504),

executes (224) and monitors execution (226) of its individual
operational plan (270-30n) and transmits out-of-plan messages

(338) to the controlling station (28) when it detects an out-of-plan
condition (336).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to resource management
in a distributed telecommunications system.A "resource" is defined herein as an element of a
communication system which may be used directly or indirectly
to support communication traffic. For example, electrical
energy stored in a satellite battery, or channel capacity of a
radio link are resources under this definition. The traffic
carrying capacity of a communications system is limited
because a finite quantity of resources exists within any system.
For example, traffic demand and equipment power requirements
(e.g., power for computers, satellite maneuvering energy, etc.)
consume system resources.In any system with limited resources, management of
resource usage is desirable to achieve optimal system
performance. Specifically, in a communication system
containing satellites or other relatively inaccessible nodes that
communicate with ground-based equipment, resource
management is critical.FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified diagram of satellite-based,
cellular communications system 10, dispersed over and
surrounding a celestial body (e.g., earth) through use of orbiting
satellites 12.Satellites 12 occupy orbits 14 that may be low-earth
orbits, medium-earth orbits, geosynchronous orbits, or a
combination thereof. Low-earth orbits are generally at an
altitude of about 600 km to 2000 km, medium-earth orbits at
about 2000 km to 20,000 km and geosynchronous orbits at about 
42,165 km, but other altitudes can also be used. In the example
shown, communications system 10 uses six polar orbit planes,
with each orbit plane holding eleven satellites 12 for a total of
sixty-six satellites 12. However, this is not essential and more
or fewer satellites, or more or fewer orbit planes or
combinations of orbiting and geosynchronous satellites, may be
used. For clarity, FIG. 1 illustrates only a few of satellites 12.Satellites 12 communicate with terrestrial equipment
which may be any number of radiocommunication Subscriber
Units 26, System Control Segment Ground Communication
Stations 24 or Gateway Ground Communication Stations 30.A "subscriber" is defined herein as a system user. FIG. 1
shows "Subscriber Unit" 26 (SU) which is an individual
communication terminal which communicates directly with a
satellite 12 via a radio link. SUs 26 may be hand-held, portable
cellular telephones adapted to transmit subscriber data to and
receive subscriber data from satellites 12. "Subscriber data" is
defined herein as data (e.g., voice, paging, or fax data)
originating
