<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for automatically mounting electronic parts 
in which chip-like electronic parts supplied from a parts 

feeding device are mounted at predetermined positions on a 
printed substrate. For efficiently and accurately carrying 

out parts mounting operation by detecting the picked-up state 
of the electronic parts, the lower end position of the electronic 

part being held by a holding nozzle is identified at a 
plurality of points by a lower end position detecting section, 

while the lower end position memory section stores the detected 
lower end position. A selecting section selects the lowest 

end position among the lower end positions detected by the 
lower end position detecting section, and compares the obtained 

lowest end position data to data stored in the data 
memory section including lowest end position data for each 

sort of electronic part, and a judging section judges if the 
held state of the electronic part is normal or abnormal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a 
method for automatically mounting electronic parts in which 
electronic parts are taken out from a parts feeding section by 
means of an holding nozzle provided in a nozzle head and are 
then mounted on a printed substrate. Heretofore, for continuously and automatically mounting 
electronic parts on a printed substrate during manufacturing 
processes, chip-like electronic parts being fed one by one by 
a parts feeding device or the like are picked up by a holdig 
nozzle using a vacuum pump or a magnet and are then mounted at 
predetermined positions on the printed substrate. Among such 
type of automatic electronic parts mounting apparatuses, there 
is known one having a function of detecting the picked up 
state of the parts for accurately mounting the parts on the 
printed substrate. Such a type of apparatus for automatically mounting 
electronic parts is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open 
No. Sho 60-121671, in which the orientation of an electronic 
part being picked up by a holding nozzle is judged as  
 
correct when a light beam from a light-emitting element is 
detected by a light-receiving element. When the thickness of 
a part varies depending on its type, the height of the light-emitting 
and light-receiving elements is adjusted by rotating 
a driving lever in accordance with the thickness information 
of the parts, so as to make correct judgment of the part's 
orientation and shape. According to the aforementioned conventional apparatus, 
the abnormality of orientation can be detected when the picking 
up is carried out by an unexpected or incorrect surface of 
an electronic part. For example, if the picking up is done 
while the part is in a completely upright state, the incorrct 
orientation can be detected since the light beam from the 
light-emitting element is interrupted by the electronic part. 
On the other hand, however, if the electronic part 100 is held 
to the take-out nozzle 101 in an inclined state, as shown in 
FIG. 1, so that the light beam from the light-emitting element 
passes a point A in FIG. 1 in the direction perpendicular to 
the sheet, the light beam cannot be interrupted by the electronic 
part 100. As a result, it would erroneously be judged 
that the electronic part 100 has correctly been picked up as 
shown by the two-dot chain line, so as to then be mounted on 
the printed substrate in the orientation as shown by solid 
lines. Due to this mislocation of the parts, the substrate 
would become
