<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an unsaturated aldehyde and an unsaturated carboxylic acid by
gas-phase catalytic oxidation of propylene, isobutylene or tertiary butanol. More particularly, this invention relates to a
method of inhibiting the performance deterioration or degeneration of the catalyst for use in said process, to a method
for reuse of the deteriorated catalyst, and to a method of regenerating the deteriorated catalyst.The production of acrolein and acrylic acid from propylene and the production of methacrolein and methacrylic acid
from isobutylene or tertiary butanol by the gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction using the so-called molybdenum-bismuth
composite oxide catalyst, and the production of acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile by the gas-phase catalytic ammoxidation
using the same catalyst are well known. However, when the reaction is continued in a long production run, this
catalyst suffers deterioration or degeneration so that the conversion and selectivity of the reaction are lowered with time.Several technologies are known for controlling the deterioration of the composite oxide catalyst. Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 59-193136, for instance, proposes a method which comprises using a molybdenum
oxide-bearing substance prepared by supporting molybdenum oxide on an inert heat-resisting inorganic
substance, and Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 63-38331 proposes a method in which a plurality
of molybdenum-bismuth multi-component catalysts prepared with a gradient of activity by varying the kinds and/or
amounts of alkali metal and thallium group elements in the molybdenum-bismuth multi-component catalyst are
arranged in an increasing order of activity from the reactant gas inlet side to the outlet side of a reactor.Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 53-30688 proposes a method in which the catalyst is diluted
with an inert substance and packed in such a manner that the catalyst activity increases either continuously or stepwise
to 100% in the direction of flow of the reactant gas, viz. from the inlet to the outlet of a reactor.However, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 59-193136 has the disadvantage that the catalyst
must be supported on an inert heat-resisting inorganic carrier and, moreover, the selectivity of the desired compound
according to the process disclosed therein is not sufficiently high for commercial use.The technologies disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publications (Kokoku) Nos.
