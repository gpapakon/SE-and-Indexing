<ABSTRACT>
Lubricant dispenser (1) for gas controlled dispensing of a lubricant to a machine, with a housing (2) for holding a lubricant supply, a machine connection part (3) with a lubricant dispensing passage (4) at one side of the housing and a gas generation cell (5) on that side of the housing (2) which is opposite the connection part (3). The gas development cell (5) is designed as an independent, multi-part component which comprises a bottom part (6), a magazine holder (7) and a cap (8) and can be inserted as an end wall in a recess (9) in the housing (2) and fixed in the said recess, the cap (8) being connected to the bottom part (6) in a manner which allows it to be pushed off and it being possible to insert into the magazine holder (7) a magazine (10) with a galvanic gas generation element (11) accommodated therein. When screwed in, the magazine (10) can be twisted between an on position and an off position. It has a cage (16) into which the gas generation element (11) is inserted. In the on position of the magazine (10), the cage (16) dips into the gas generation fluid. In the off position of the magazine, the gas generation element (11) can be separated from the gas generation fluid.
