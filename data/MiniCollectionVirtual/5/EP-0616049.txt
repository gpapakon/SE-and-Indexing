<ABSTRACT>
Adherent metal coatings are provided on articles 
comprising a polyimide of 3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxybiphenyl 

and 4-aminoethyl ether by non-electrolytic metal 
deposition (e.g., physical vapor deposition or electroless 

deposition) following a treatment method comprising steps 
of contact with strong nitric acid, with strong sulfuric acid 

and with an aqueous alkaline permanganate solution, the 
first two steps being followed by a water rinse. The 

metallized article is then heat-treated for at least about 
30 minutes at a temperature in the range of about 60-100°C. 

Optional steps are treatment with an alkaline 
solution after sulfuric acid treatment and deposition of a 

further metal coating such as an electrolytic coating; said 
further metal deposition is also followed by a heat 

treatment step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the improvement of adhesion 
of metal coatings to polyimide surfaces, and more 
particularly their adhesion to surfaces of polyimides of 
tetracarboxybiphenyls. Polyimides of the type prepared by the reaction 
of 3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxybiphenyl or its functional 
derivatives with various aromatic diamines, especially 4-aminophenyl 
ether, are noted for their solvent resistance, 
thermal stability, good mechanical properties and low 
dielectric constant. They are in wide use for various 
purposes, including as substrates for metallization. 
Metallized 3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxybiphenyl polyimides are 
useful in printed circuit boards, both rigid and flexible. For 
that purpose, the metal layer is patterned by additive, 
semi-additive or subtractive methods known in the art. For the most part, such polyimides have been 
metallized by methods involving the use of copper foil. 
Typical methods of this type are disclosed in European 
patent applications 431,636 and 459,452, German 
Offenlegungsschrift 3,215,944 and Japanese Kokai 
56/118,204, 58/190,091 and 58/190,093. Another method, 
disclosed in Japanese Kokai 03/274,261, involved vacuum 
sputtering of a titanium layer on plasma-treated polyimide, 
followed by vacuum deposition of a titanium and then a 
copper layer. Adhesion of such metal layers is generally 
measured as "peel strength", which is the force required to 
peel an adherent metal layer from a substrate under 
controlled conditions.  The adhesion of 3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxybiphenyl 
polyimides to metal layers deposited thereon by electroless 
deposition is generally poor. Therefore, electroless 
methods have not been commercially employed in connection 
with the use of such polyimides. The present invention provides a method for 
treatment of surfaces of certain 3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxybiphenyl 
polyimides to improve adhesion of 
metal layers, especially those deposited by electroless 
deposition. Said method requires only readily available 
chemicals and relatively short treatment times, and thus 
may be practiced quite inexpensively and simply. In one of its aspects, therefore, the invention is 
a method for depositing an adherent metal layer on the 
surface of a resinous substrate comprising a polyimide of 
3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxybiphenyl and 4-aminophenyl ether, 
said method comprising the steps of:
 
   contacting at least a portion of said surface 
with nitric acid, of at least about 60% concentration by 
weight,
 
   contacting said surface with sulfuric acid of at 
least
