<ABSTRACT>
A sealing material is prepared by 
furnishing a liquid composition comprising a 

polydiene or polyolefin polyol, a polyisocyanate 
compound, a foam stabilizer, and a blowing 

agent, uniformly dispersing an inert gas in the 
liquid composition by mechanical agitation to 

form a bubbled composition, shaping the bubbled 
composition into a sheet shape, and heat curing 

the bubbled shape at a temperature below the 
decomposition temperature of the blowing agent. 

The sealing material is lightweight and has a 
high blowing magnification. On use, the sealing 

material is disposed in a cavity of an 
automotive pillar or similar member and heated 

for foaming to fill the cavity with the foamed 
product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to foamable and foam
materials, e.g. such as are suitable to be put in a cavity
of a pillar or another member in an automobile and heated
for foaming into a polyurethane foam for sealing purposes.
It also relates to the preparation and use of such
materials.Automobile center pillars and other frame
members have a hollow cavity. Common practice
is to fill the cavity with a foam for the
purposes of preventing wind noise and absorbing
vibration. The cavity is filled with a foam by
various methods. For example, foam previously
shaped to the cavity shape is inserted into the
cavity through an access opening. Alternatively,
a foamable material which is capable of
foaming and expanding upon heating is placed in
the cavity as a spot sealing material and later
foamed to fill the cavity by heat encountered in 
a furnace for baking electrodeposited paint coating.The former method of inserting a shaped foam body
into a cavity, however, has the problem that the cavity
is filled to a varying extent partially because of
insertion through an access opening. It is difficult to
completely fill the cavity along its configuration from
corner to corner. The access opening which is often
defined by punching out strip steel leaves a danger that
the worker would have hands injured.The latter method also suffers from several
problems. The maximum volume expansion of typical
sealing materials (known as spot sealing material) is
generally to only twice the original volume. Where a
large volume must be filled, a large amount of sealing
material is needed, which increases not only cost but
also weight, contrary to the general demand for
lightweight automobiles and products generally.US-A-3,772,224, US-A-4,412,013 and GB-A-1,009,007
all disclose polyurethane-based foamed materials.
Various chemical compositions and manufacturing methods
are used, but a common feature is that curing to form the
expanded foam structure is carried out in one temporal
step with only one heating stage.The general aim here is the provision of new
foamable materials, new methods of preparing foamable
materials, and new methods of filling or sealing using
foamable materials. Preferred aims are to achieve a high degree of
expansion, and to achieve light weight (low density) of 
the material.A particular aim is the application to fill a cavity
in an automobile structural member, e.g. in a pillar.In one general aspect we propose a technique in which
a liquid composition, containing polyurethane precursor
compounds and a blowing
