<DESCRIPTION>
Highly filled, dense, thermoplastic based 
compositions which have ceramic like properties are 
may be used in applications usually reserved for 
ceramics or filled thermosets. This is because of the 
relative ease with which thermoplastics may be 
fabricated. The applicants have discovered that certain 
polymers may be combined with exceptionally high levels 
of inorganic fillers which result in a molding 
composition which is capable of being molded into 
articles having ceramic like properties. These polymers 
are selected from the group consisting of polycarbonates, 
polyetherimides and copolymers thereof, polycyclohexyl 
terephthalates and copolymers thereof, polypropyl 
terephthalates and copolymers thereof, polyethylene 
terephthalates and copolymers thereof, polyimides, 
polyestercarbonates, polyphenylene sulfides, polyamides, 
polyamideimides, polyarylates, polymethylpentene, 
polysulfones, polyether sulfones, polystyrenes, rubber 
modified high impact polystyrene, acetals, SAN, SMA, 
ASA, modified polyphenylene ethers, polyether ketones, 
ABS, PVC, PFA, ECTFE, ETFE, PVDF, liquid crystal 
polymers and combinations thereof, which are combined 
with at 30% - 80% by weight of a filler selected from 
zinc oxide or barium sulfate, zirconium oxide, Zirconium 
silicate or mixtures thereof. These compositions may be used to mold useful 
objects such as tableware, dishes, bowls, mugs and the 
like which require a smooth surface. In addition, the 
selection of the proper level of filler will provide a 
density in the molded article which approaches the 
density of ceramics. The compositions of the invention which contain 
barium sulfate as a filler may be utilized to prepare  
 
containers intended for use in microwave cooking. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention 
to provide novel molding compositions which contain a 
high level of fillers which will provide a smooth 
surface. It is also an object of this invention to 
provide novel molding compositions which have a high 
level of fillers which will have a ceramic-like feel and 
density. It is also an object of this invention to 
provide novel molding compositions having special 
utility for making molded articles. It is also an object of this invention to 
provide novel molding compositions which may be employed 
for making highly dense molded articles. These and other objects of the invention will 
become apparent from the present specification. The present invention is concerned with a 
composition of a resin selected from the group 
consist
