<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an industrial microbicide and 
a method of killing microbes for industrial use, and more 
particularly to an industrial microbicide and a method of 
killing microbes for industrial use to antisepsis or microbicidal 
of papermaking water in a paper/pulp industry, 
cooling water and washing water in various industries, heavy 
oil sludges, cutting fluids, textile oils, paints, paper 
coating liquids, latices and sizings. Slimes generated due to the growth of bacteria and/or 
fungi in cooling water and process water of the paper/pulp 
industry or various industries deteriorate a quality of 
products and efficiency of production. Further, in various 
industrial products, such as heavy oil sludges, cutting 
fluids, textile oils, paints, various latices and sizings, 
putrefaction and contamination occur due to the growth of 
bacteria and/or fungi which reduces their value.  
 For the prevention of these problems produced by such 
microorganism, many microbicides have been used. Previously, 
organomercury compounds and chlorinated phenols were 
used for this purpose. However, the use of these compounds 
is to be regulated, because they have a strong toxicity to 
the human body, fish and shellfish and may cause environmental 
pollution. Lately, organonitrogen-sulfur compounds, organohalide 
compounds and organosulfur compounds which have relatively 
low toxicity, are practically used [see BOKIN-BOKABI-JITEN 
(Dictionary of Antibacterial and Antifungal Agent) published 
by Antibacterial and Antifungal Society, 1986; Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. (HEI) 3-170404/1991, 3-83902/1991 
and 3-167101/1991]. As examples of this type of microbicides, α-chloro-O-acylbenzaldoximes 
derived from α-chlorobenzaldoxime and α-chloro-chlorobenzaldoximes 
are known (see Japanese Patent 
Publication Nos. (SHO) 50-158844/1975, 54-36647/1979 and 
51-33171/1976). However, it is not known that α-chlorobenzaldoxime 
itself shows a potent microbicidal property in industrial 
media. The conventional organic microbicides and the above 
microbicides exhibit effective microbicidal effect when used 
to non-reductive industrial media. However, when the conventional  
 
organic microbicides are used in the presence of a 
reducing agent such as sulfite ion, the microbicidal activity 
is significantly reduced, whereby the problems mentioned 
above can not be solved. The present invention provides an industrial microbicide 
comprising α-chlorobenzaldoxime as an active ingredient. The present invention also
