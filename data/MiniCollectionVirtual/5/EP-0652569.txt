<ABSTRACT>
Leak-detection system (100) and method for detecting 
a leaking container (70). The system includes an 

enclosure (120) defining a cavity (130) therein surrounding 
the container, which container may be a nuclear fuel rod 

(70) having fission products (90) leaking through a breach 
(110) in the exterior surface (75) of the fuel rod. A 

plurality of fuel rods are bundled together to define a 
fuel assembly. The fission products are capable of adhering 

to the exterior surface of the fuel rod as the fission 
products leak through the breach in the fuel rod. A 

radiation detector (160) is in communication with the 
cavity for detecting the fission products leaking through 

the breach. Moreover, a gas injector (370) is in communication 
with the cavity for injecting a multiplicity of 

carrier gas bubbles (400) into the cavity to remove any 
fission products adhering to the exterior surface of the 

fuel rod and to carry the fission products removed thereby 
to the radiation detector. In this manner, the detector 

detects the leaking fission products even though they may 
tend to adhere to the exterior surface of the fuel rod. In 

addition, an elevator (440) is connected to the fuel assembly 
for elevating the fuel assembly in the cavity, so that 

the external pressure acting against the exterior surface 
of the fuel rods is reduced in order to relieve the internal 

pressure in the fuel rods. As the fuel assembly is 
elevated, any fission products tending to "hide-out" in the  

 
fuel rods expand and migrate through the breach. As the 

fission products migrate through the breach, they are 
carried by the carrier gas bubbles to the radiation detector 

where they are detected by the radiation detector. In 
this manner, otherwise undetectable leaking fuel rods 

become detectable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to leak detection
and more particularly relates to a leak-detection system
and method for detecting a leaking container, which leaking
container may be a leaking nuclear fuel rod having a
radioactive fission product material leaking therefrom.However, before discussing the current state of
the art, it is instructive first to briefly describe the
structure and operation of a typical nuclear reactor which
may contain leaking fuel rods. In this regard, a typical
nuclear reactor includes a pressure vessel containing a
plurality of fuel assemblies therein defining a nuclear
reactor core capable of producing heat by fission of
fissile nuclear material. More specifically, each fuel
assembly includes a plurality of fuel rods having the
fissile nuclear material sealingly contained therein in the
form of a plurality of coaxially stacked fuel pellets. As
the fissile material forming the fuel pellets fissions,
radioactive fission products (e.g., Xenon - 135 and Kr-85)
are produced within the fuel rod. Such radioactive fission
products are normally sealingly contained within the fuel
rod because the fuel pellets producing the fission products
are themselves sealingly contained within the fuel rod.
Liquid moderator coolant (i.e., demineralized water) is
caused to flow through the fuel assemblies and over the
fuel rods for assisting in the fission process and for
removing the heat produced by the fission process. During 
operation of the nuclear reactor, the heat due to fission
of the fissile material is carried from the fuel rods by
the liquid moderator coolant, which flows from the pressure
vessel and through a piping system connected to the pressure
vessel and thence ultimately to a turbine-generator
for generating electricity in a manner well understood in
the art.However, the fuel rods may occasionally leak.
Leaking fuel rods are undesirable because such leaking fuel
rods may release the radioactive fission products into the
liquid moderator coolant flowing over the fuel rods,
thereby radioactively contaminating any reactor system
components in fluid communication with the coolant. Such
reactor components may be, for example, structures housed
within the pressure vessel, piping interconnecting the
components of the reactor system, cooling tower apparatus
or the turbine belonging to the previously mentioned
turbine-generator. Increased levels of radioactive contamination
in these reactor system components increases the
time required for servicing the components because the
component
