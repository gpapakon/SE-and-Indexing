<ABSTRACT>
A connector for shielded cables comprises a housing 
of insulating material and signal and ground contacts 

accommodated in said housing and to which corresponding 
conductors of the cables are connectable, said contacts being 

arranged in rows and columns. The housing is assembled of one 
or more modules and at least one module cap, wherein each 

module can be detachably mounted in the module cap in a 
predetermined position with respect to the module cap, and 

wherein each module is provided with at least one column of 
contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector for shielded
cables according to the preamble of claim 1.Such connectors are known in several embodiments.
Generally, the number of signal and ground contacts of the
connector and thereby the dimensions of the housing of the
connector is adapted to the number of shielded cables to be
connected by one connector to a coupling socket as required by
the user. This means that a large number of different
connectors has to be manufactured. Moreover, the housing of
the usual connector consists of one part or a plurality of
permanently assembled parts, whereby a repair of the connector
for a fault in one cable is difficult.WO 92/22943 and US-A-5 114 364 disclose a connector
for shielded cables according to the preamble of claim 1.
The housing of this known connector comprises one module cap
only and it is not possible to combine two or more module
caps in such a manner that a fixed spacing between successive
contacts in row direction throughout the complete
connector will be maintained.The invention aims to provide a connector of the
above-mentioned type which is made in such a manner that the
dimensions of the connector can be adapted to the required
number and type of cables to be connected in a very simple
manner.To this end the connector of the invention is
characterized by the characterizing features of claim 1.Thereby, a connector is obtained which by combining
module caps with one or more modules can be
adapted to the number of cables to be connected to the
connector. As each module can only be mounted in one
predetermined position in the module cap, connection errors
are excluded. Different modules can be provided for different
types of cables. Thereby, the connector of the invention can
be easily adapted to the requirements of the user. Moreover,
repair of the connector is possible in a simple manner.  The invention will be further explained hereinafter
by reference to the drawings in which several embodiments of
the connector according to the invention are shown.Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a module cap of a
first embodiment of the connector according to the invention,
wherein two shielded cables with a differential pair of signal
conductors to be connected are shown.Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the module cap of
Fig. 1, wherein the signal and ground conductors of the cables
are connected to the corresponding contacts of a module.Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of the module cap of
Fig. 1, wherein three modules are shifted into the module cap
