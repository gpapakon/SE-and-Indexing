<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 
vinylidenefluoride (VDF) polymers by polymerization in an 
aqueous medium in the presence of radical initiators and of a 
suitable chain transfer agent. It is known that polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and the 
VDF copolymers with other fluorinated olefins (for instance 
hexafluoropropene or tetrafluoroethylene) can be prepared by 
polymerization in an aqueous medium, using organic or 
inorganic peroxides as initiators. The most commonly used are 
diterbutylperoxide (DTBP) (see US Patent 3,193,539) and 
diisopropylperoxydicarbonate (IPP) (see US Patent 3,475,396). 
To effectively control molecular weight distribution in such 
a way to improve mechanical properties and processability of 
the final product, the use during the polymerization reaction 
of suitable chain transfer agents has been proposed. For 
instance, in US Patent 3,475,396 acetone is employed, which 
acts both as chain transfer agent and as conveying medium for 
the peroxide (IPP). Again when IPP is used as initiator, the 
use of isopropyl alcohol as chain transfer agent is described  
 
in US Patent 4,360,652. Finally, in the patent EP-387,938, 
PVDF is prepared using a peroxydisulphate as initiator and an 
alkyl acetate as molecular weight regulator. The utilization 
of such polar compounds as chain transfer agents has, however, 
the inconvenience of producing polar end-groups, which cause 
phenomena of product discoloration, in particular during the 
melt processing stage. To reduce the discoloration phenomena, in the patent EP-169,328 
the use of trichlorofluoromethane as chain transfer 
agent in VDF polymerization is described. However, trichlorofluoromethane 
is a polluting product for environment, since it 
is a perhalogenated chlorine-containing compound and therefore 
having a high ozone depleting potential. The Applicant has now found that 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane 
(HCFC-123) is a chain transfer agent 
particularly effective during VDF polymerization in an aqueous 
medium, and allows to obtain a final product with very good 
appearance, substantially devoid of discoloration effects at 
high temperatures. Object of the present invention is, therefore, a process 
for preparing vinylidenefluoride (VDF) polymers, which 
comprises polymerizing VDF, optionally in association with 
other fluorinated olefins, in an aqueous medium in the  
 
presence of a radical initiator and of 1,1,1,-trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane 
(HCFC-123) as chain transfer agent. As known, HCFC-123 is
