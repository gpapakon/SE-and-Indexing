<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones using 
a borane reducing agent in the presence of a novel and valuable chiral oxazaborolidine 
catalyst and to certain of said chiral oxazaborolidine catalysts useful in said reduction. The enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones to yield substantially 
enantiomerically pure alcohols has long been a goal of synthetic organic chemists. A 
number of reagents have been reported which effect such a transformation. (See, for 
example, Corey, U.S. Patent No. 4,943,635, the subject matter of which is incorporated 
herein by reference). However, these methods suffer from one or more of the following 
drawbacks: (a) unacceptable amounts of the undesired enantiomer present as an 
impurity with the product; (b) low yields of alcohol; (c) difficulty of carrying out the 
reaction; (d) expense of preparing the catalyst; (e) difficulty in preparing the catalyst; 
or (f) inapplicability to a wide range of substituted prochiral ketones. The previously disclosed (see, for example, Corey, supra, Merck, European 
Patent Application Nos. 0 453 288 A1 and 0 453 298 A2) enantioselectively effective 
oxazaborolidine catalysts are disubstituted at the carbon atom attached directly to the 
oxygen atom of the catalyst (e.g., the C5 carbon atom of formula (I) below). When said 
carbon atom is not disubstituted, the product of the reduction reaction is much less 
optically pure (see Martens, et al., Tetrahedron:Asymmetry, 3, 347-50 (1992)). It is therefore an object of this invention to provide chiral oxazaborolidine 
compounds which are capable of directing the enantioselective reduction of prochiral 
ketones to generate substantially enantiomerically pure alcohols. It is a further object of this invention to provide said chiral oxazaborolidine 
compounds which are easily prepared from relatively inexpensive starting materials or 
readily available starting materials. It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method of using said chiral 
oxazaborolidine compounds as catalysts for the enantioselective reduction of prochiral 
ketones to afford substantially enantiomerically pure alcohols.  
 This invention provides a chiral oxazaborolidine compound of the formula 
 
wherein R1 is hydrogen, (C1-C8)alkyl, benzyl, phenyl or phenyl variously substituted with 
up to three (C1-C8)alkyl, (C1-C8)alkoxy or halo groups such as chloro or fluoro; and R2 
and R3 are syn and are each identically phenyl or phenyl variously substituted with up
