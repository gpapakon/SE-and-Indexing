<ABSTRACT>
A new method and apparatus is described for conducting an 
integrity test on porous membranes and membrane filters and for 

conducting a pore-size characterization of membrane. The method 
and apparatus apply to membrane integrity tests and pore-size 

characterizations which are based on the dependence on the pore size 
of the pressure required to intrude a non-wetting, electrically 

conductive liquid into and through the pores. Electrical-measurement 
methods are described for identifying the pressure at 

which intrusion occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
determining both the pore-size characteristics and integrity of porous
membranes and membrane filters and employs miscible liquids, at
least one of which is electrically conductive, which do not
spontaneously wet the porous structure of the membrane.
Specifically, this invention relates to a method for
determining the pore-size characteristics and/or integrity of a
membrane or filter based upon the use of electrically conductive
liquids and electrical measurements.Presently, the pore-size characterization and determination of
integrity for membranes and filters, in general, are performed via
procedures which are referred to as, among other things, "air-flow
porosimetry", the "bubble-point test" or "bubble-point
determination", and the "diffusion test". In addition, hydrophobic
membranes, specifically, can also be characterized and tested by
procedures referred to as, among other things, the "water intrusion-pressure
determination" and the "water-flow test" or "water-intrusion
test".The bubble-point test and air-flow porosimetry utilize a liquid
which spontaneously wets the membrane in question, and are based on
the fact that subsequent attempts to displace the wetting liquid with a
gas require that the gas pressure be elevated to some critical level
dependent on the size of the pores, or the size of defects if present,
in order to overcome the surface-tension forces holding the liquid in 
the pores. The equation for this critical pressure, defined as the
bubble-point pressure, is a variation of the Young-Laplace equation
for capillary pressure drop, in this application often called the
Washburn equation:
PBUBBLE POINT = 4 K σ cos()/d
where
PBUBBLE POINT =bubble-point pressureK =the pore perimeter (shape) correction factorσ =surface tension of the liquid =contact angle of the liquid against the solidd =the diameter of the poreEquation 1 is rarely actually used to quantitatively calculate a
pore size from empirical bubble-point data, since the pore perimeter
correction factor, K, is rarely known independently. Instead, since
the equation indicates that the bubble point is inversely related to the
pore diameter, it is used as a justification to qualitatively rank the
relative pore size of membranes according to their bubble-point
pressures. Further, since particle retention efficiency is related to
the pore size, Equation 1 also serves as a conceptual justification for
empirically correlating the retention efficiency of membranes of
various pore sizes to their

A process for determining a pore-size characteristic
and/or an integrity of an electrically non-conductive porous

membrane comprising the steps of:

contacting a first surface of said membrane with an
electrically conductive first liquid which does not wet said

membrane,
contacting a second surface of said membrane with a
second liquid which does not wet said membrane,
increasing pressure on said first liquid,
measuring a change in electrical conductivity across
said membrane or of said second liquid at different pressure

levels, and
correlating said change of electrical conductivity with
said pore-size characteristic and/or said integrity of said

membrane by plotting the changes in the measured electrical
conductivity with respect to changes in pressure versus the

pressure at which said changes in the electrical conductivity
occured, thereby identifying an intrusion pressure of the

membrane.
The process of claim 1, wherein in the step of
increasing the pressure the pressure is increased on said

first liquid and on said second liquid and the change in
electrical conductivity is measured across said membrane.
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the pressure is
increased to create a differential pressure across said

membrane.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein in the
step of increasing the pressure on said first liquid the

The process of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein in the
step of increasing the pressure on said first liquid the 

pressure is increased to a pressure less than a
characteristic intrusion pressure of said membrane.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said
porous membrane contains a third liquid which prevents said

first liquid and said second liquid from wetting said

solution.
The process of claim 6, wherein said third liquid is
polyethylene glycol and said first liquid is an aqueous

said change of electrical conductivity is measured
