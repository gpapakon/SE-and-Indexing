<ABSTRACT>
A method is specified for detecting earth faults on the conductors of an electric machine, in which method a potential difference with respect to the earth is applied to the conductors of the machine by means of an injection voltage (Ui). Optimum use of the injection converter (5) is obtained in that the injection signal (Ui) comprises a square-wave signal in the transmission period (S), which signal is periodically switched over between a positive maximum and a negative maximum and has, at the start and at the end of the transmission period (S), a quarter period of either the positive or the negative maximum.

Method for detecting earth faults on the
conductors of an electrical machine, in which method


a) the conductors are biased with respect to the
earth potential by means of a low-frequency injection

voltage signal (U
i
) of frequency f1, the injection
signal (Ui) having a transmission period (S) and a

pause period (P), charaterized in that
b) the injection signal (Ui) in the transmission
period (S) comprises a square-wave signal which is

switched over periodically between a positive and a
negative maximum and has at the start and at the end of

the transmission period (S) a quarter-period either of
the positive or of the negative maximum.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the injection signal (Ui) has a positive quarter-period
both at the start and at the end of the

transmission period (S).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the injection signal (Ui) has a positive quarter-period
at the start of the transmission period (S) and

a negative quarter-period at the end.
Method according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
in that
 the injection signal (Ui) composed of the
product of a first square-wave signal (U1), which is of

frequency f1 and is switched over symmetrically about
zero to a first, positive or negative value, and a

second square-wave signal (U2) which is of frequency
f2=f1/n, n being even or odd, is switched over between

a second, positive value and zero and has a phase shift
(dT) of 1/(4*f1) with respect to the first (U1).
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the frequency (f2) of the second square-wave
signal (U2) is f1/8, n thus being equal to 8.
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the frequency (f2) of the second square-wave
signal (U2) is f1/7, n thus being equal to 7. 
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the frequency (f1) of the
injection signal (U
i
) is a quarter of the nominal
frequency.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the electrical machine is
a three-phase machine, in particular a generator.
