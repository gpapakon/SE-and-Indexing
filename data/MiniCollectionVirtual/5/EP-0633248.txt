<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a butenoic acid 
derivative having an excellent activity as a drug. In Europe and America, cardiovascular diseases 
top the list of death causes. Meanwhile, although 
cerebrovascular diseases such as cerebral apoplexy 
rather ranked high in death causes in Japan, a 
tendency for ischemic heart diseases to increase 
rapidly has been recently seen as the life-style and 
diet have neared those of Europe and America.  The term "ischemic heart disease" refers to 
a series of diseases generally caused when the supply 
of oxygen to the cardiac muscle does not meet the 
demand of the muscle for oxygen. Representative 
examples thereof include coronary arteriosclerosis, 
acute myocardial infarction and stenocardia. Although 
a nitro drug, calcium antagonist or β-blocker is now 
used for the treatment of the above diseases, no 
sufficiently effective drug has been found as yet. 
Accordingly, the development of a new drug superior 
to those of the prior art has been expected. The inventors of the present invention have 
studied for a long time to obtain a new type of remedy 
for ischemic heart diseases and have found that the 
butenoic acid derivative which will be described 
below exhibits an excellent coronary vasodilating 
effect. Namely, the compound of the present invention 
is a butenoic acid derivative represented by the  
 
following general formula (I) or a pharmacologically 
acceptable salt thereof: 
wherein R¹ represents 1 ○ a heteroaryl group, 2 ○ a 
group represented by the formula: 
{wherein R² and R2' may be the same or different from 
each other and each represent a hydrogen atom or 
a lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or allyl group, or 
alternatively, R² and R2' may together form a ring, 
X represents an oxygen or sulfur atom, a group 
represented by the formula: = N-R³ (wherein R³ 
represents a cyano, lower alkanoyl, lower 
alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, sulfamoyl, alkylsulfonyl, 
arylsulfonyl or nitro group) or a group represented 
by the formula: 
(wherein R' and R'' may be 
the same or different from each other and each 
represent a hydrogen atom or an alkylsulfonyl, 
arylsulfonyl or nitro group)}, 3 ○ a group represented  
 
by the formula: 
{wherein R⁴ represents 
a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or 
allyl group and R⁵ represents a cyano, lower 
alkylcarbonyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl or 
sulfamoyl group}, or 4 ○ a group represented by the formula: 
E-NH- (wherein E represents a heteroaryl group which may be 
substituted),
