<ABSTRACT>
Viral infection is inhibited in mammals by administration of metabolically stable, non-toxic 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) derivatives that have a dual therapeutic effect. The compounds activate the intracellular latent 2-5A dependent endoribonuclease RNase L and also inhibit the action of viral DNA polymerases. Conjugates of the 2-5A derivatives for therapeutic delivery are also described.
