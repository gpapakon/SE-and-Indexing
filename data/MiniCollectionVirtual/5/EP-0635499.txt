<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel tetrazine derivatives
and a process for their preparation. Furthermore, the invention
relates to acaricidal compositions containing the
novel compounds as well as to the preparation and use of
these compositions. The compounds of the invention are
effective against mites, their larvae and especially their
eggs.It is known that phytophagous mites are potentially
the most important pests damaging the cultivated food-,
industrial and ornamental plants as well as stored crops
whereas ectoparasitic mites are severely dangerous from the
viewpoint of public and veterinary hygiene. The loss caused
by phytophagous mites and the importance of protection
against them has abruptly been enhanced. This can essentially
be attributed to two reasons:
1) The predators and parasites maintaining the mite
populations below the threshold value of loss were
thinned by the use of non-selective insecticides.2) Due to the short generation time and their adapta
bility, mites develop resistance within a relatively
short period.Typical representatives of harmful mite species in
question are: spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), itch-mite
(Psoroptes cuniculi), red spider mite (Tetranychus 
cinnabarinus) and other species hereinafter listed in detail.Due to the increasing loss caused by mites, the development
of highly effective, specific acaricides is of
increasing interest. For this purpose, a high number of
tetrazine derivatives have been synthesized by various research
groups (see EP-A-5912, EP-A-29657 and EP-A-248,466
as well as HU 184,684).A series of 1,2,4,5-tetrazines has been synthesized
and screened for acaricidal activity by P.J. Brooker et
al., Pestic. Sci. 18 (1987) 179-190, among others
3,6-bis(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine or
3,6-bis (2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine.In the EP-A-5912 several 3,6-bis(2-halophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazines
and 3,6-bis(2-halophenyl)-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazines
are disclosed, wherein the halogens, being
the same or different for each compound, may be fluorine,
chlorine or bromine. In EP-A-29657 a number of other
3,6-bis(2-halophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazines and 3-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine,
too,
are described. From these compounds 3,6-bis(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine
described in EP-A-5912 became
commercially available under the trade name ApolloÂ® 
(clofentezine; Pesticide Manual 1987, page 188). Being inactive
against adult individuals and nymphs as motile development
forms of mites, clofentezine is a selectively ovicidal
