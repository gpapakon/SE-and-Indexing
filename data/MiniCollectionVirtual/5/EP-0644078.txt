<ABSTRACT>
A car interior member and its molding method are offered to improve   recycling 
and to reduce the number of parts. The instrument 

panel (10) as the car interior member is 
made by molding integrally the core member (11) organizing 

the main structure of certain 
area of car interior and the functional member (12,13,14) 

having particular function and 
attached to the core member (11) by the blow molding. 

The number of parts can be more reduced when the base layer 
placed on the most inside, th
e foamed 
layer and the surface layer placed on the most outside 

of the member are molded by a multilayer 
blow molding in case of the instrument panel (10) formed 

with the multi-layer construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a car interior member and its molding method, and
intends particularly to be used to mold an instrument panel in front area of the car, a rear-board
unit in rear area of the car, a door trim, a console unit, a head rest, a trunk-room unit
and various lids.Conventionally, the car interior members such as the instrument panel have been
advancing in resinification to comply with requirements of moldability, free in shape, design,
corrosion resistance and weight saving, and more particularly, a polyolefin resin material
such as polypropylene has been employed to satisfy requirement of high-temperature
properties and stiffness properties for the car interior member.The car interior member, especially the instrument panel, is provided with a lot of
functional parts held some functions such as ducts and meter clusters, and its shape is
rather complicated.Accordingly, under the present circumstances, a core member and every
functional member defining the car interior member are separately formed, and then the car
interior member can be assembled with the separately prepared parts.The above polyolefin resin material such as polypropylene used in many cases as
the car interior member is not applicable in a large-scale blow molding because of a
dissatisfactory blow moldability such as drawdown resistance. Therefore, an external
appearance of a molding tends to be inferior even if the drawdown resistance is improved
by an increase of molecular weight. Accordingly, the blow molding has been applied
limitedly to members not exposing from surface of the car interior which does not require
a satisfaction on an external appearance, and comparatively small functional member.Fig. 8 depicts a molding method for an instrument panel 90 as an example of
conventional molding method for the above described car interior member.The instrument panel 90 is arranged with a core member 91 forming main
structure of the front area of the car interior, a duct 92 as functional member applied in the
core member 91, a meter cluster 93 and a surface member 94.The core member 91 is formed by an injection molding with a denatured
substance of PPO (polyphenylene oxide) (Trademark; "NORIRU"), PPF (filler filled
polypropylene), or PPG (glassfibre fitted polypropylene). The duct 92 is provided for an air-conditioning, heater, defroster received in the
core member 91 and is formed by the blow molding with PP (polypropylene), or PP/EPR
(polypropylene/ethylene propylene rubber).The meter cluster 93 is a member surrounding

<CLAIMS>
A car interior member, comprising: an elongate hollow
core member (11) providing a main structure of certain area

of car interior, and at least one integral elongate
functional member (13,14) having a particular function;

characterised in that the car interior member is formed by
blow molding in such a way that the interior walls of the

car interior member join along at least one longitudinally
extending line (E) thereby forming at least two

substantially fully enclosed longitudinally extending
hollow ducts one of which provides the core member (11) and

at least one of which provides the or each functional
member (13,14).
A car interior member according to claim 1, wherein
the functional member (13,14) is an air duct for defrosting

air.
A car interior member according to claim 1, wherein
the functional member (13,14) is an air duct for

controlling the car interior temperature.
A method of molding a hollow car interior member,
comprising the step of blow molding the car interior member

to form integrally an elongate core member (11) providing
a main structure of certain area of car interior and at

least one longitudinally extending functional member
(13,14) having a particular function; characterised in that

the car interior member is blow molded in such a way that
the interior walls of the core and interior member join

along at least one longitudinally extending line (E)
thereby forming at least two substantially fully enclosed

longitudinally extending hollow ducts one of which provides
the core member (11) and at least one of which provides the

or each functional member (13,14). 
A method according to claim 4, wherein the core member
(11) and the functional member (13,14) have an innermost

base layer (21) and an outermost surface layer (23), the
two layers being simultaneously molded with a multilayer

blow molding.
