<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a new method and to a 
new device capable of increasing the capacity for 
dissipation of the heat generated by the discharge inside 
an ion engine for space propulsion through the ceramic 
walls of the ionization chamber to the external environment. In general, the invention is concerned with an 
ion thruster of the type comprising an outer supporting 
structure, an ionization chamber made of ceramic 
material, means of supplying gas to said ionization 
chamber, and means of ionizing the gas. The invention is 
concerned more particularly, but not exclusively, with 
thrusters having a ceramic coating of the acceleration 
channel, and based on the generation of the discharge in 
"Closed Electron Drift" conditions, known commercially as 
"Stationary Plasma Thrusters" (SPT). For a more detailed 
description of this type of thruster, reference should be 
made to A.I. Bugrova et al., "Physical processes and 
characteristics of stationary plasma thrusters with 
closed electron drift" - A I D A A / A I A A / D G L R / 
J S A S S, 22nd Int. Elect. Prop. Conference, IEPC-91-079, 
October 14-17, 1991, Viareggio. It is known that, in plasma engines or thrusters, 
part of the power used to generate the plasma by means of 
a discharge in the propulsion gas is dissipated to the 
walls of the discharge chamber. The heat transferred to 
the walls of the chamber from the plasma formed during 
the discharge is then dissipated by linear conduction to 
the other walls of the device and/or by radiation towards 
the exterior. In general, the walls of the discharge chamber 
must have good thermal conductivity to avoid the presence 
of localized overheated areas. The presence of such areas 
would be extremely damaging to the walls, since over-heating,  
 
whether localized or widespread, limits the life 
of the device by causing over a short period of time the 
appearance of deformations, erosion of the surface of the 
discharge chamber, and even fracture. This problem is particularly marked when the 
walls of the ionization or discharge chamber are made of 
ceramic materials, with low thermal conductivity and low 
thermal shock resistance. Attempts are currently being made to overcome 
this problem by the use of particular types of ceramics 
with good thermal conductivity. These ceramics, however, 
have disadvantages in respect of function and cost. The object of the invention, therefore, is to 
offer a more effective solution to solve the problem of 
heat dissipation along the ceramic walls of the
