<ABSTRACT>
The lid (13) of the wind protection device (9) is fastened pivotably onto the rear wall (12) with a hinge (23). A torsion spring, connected at the ends to the lid (13) in a rotationally fixed manner, is inserted in the hinge (23). The torsion spring is held in the middle with the aid of a bracket on the rear wall (12). With the lid (13) open, the torsion spring is unstressed and is torsioned when the lid is closed, so that part of the lid weight is compensated and the impact on the wind protection is thus damped. The frame (21) closing off the wind protection at the bottom has, on its underside, a groove in which tongues arranged on the top (15) of the balance housing (3) engage. A spring is fastened on the groove in the frame (21) under the front side of the wind protection device (9) and is suspended in a groove in the tongue when the wind protection device is placed on the balance housing (3). By means of gentle lifting of the wind protection device (9) at the rear side, the locking between the spring and the tongue can be broken and the wind protection device can thus be removed from the balance (1).

A top-pan precision balance having a draught-proofing 
arrangement Which is fitted onto the top side (15) of the balance 

housing (3) and which comprises a plurality of walls connected together 
at the edges and a cover Which is pivotably fixed to a horizontally 

disposed hinge and which closes the opening formed at the top by the 
walls, characterised in that a spring (39, 139) Which acts in opposite 

relationship to the direction of closing movement of the cover (13, 113) 
is fitted in the hinge (23, 123), the maximum spring force being lower 

than the force required to lift the cover. 
A balance according to claim 1 characterised in that the spring 
(39) fitted in the hinge (23) is in the form of a torsion bar whose two 

ends are held non-rotatably to the fixed holding member (27) of the 
hinge (23), Which is secured to a wall (12), and in which the pivotal 

member (12) of the hinge (23), which is secured to the cover (13), is 
non-rotatably connected to the torsion bar between the ends. 
A balance according to claim 1 characterised in that the spring 
(39) fitted in the hinge is in the form of a torsion bar whose first end 

is non-rotatably held to the fixed holding member (27) of the hinge 
(23), which is secured to a wall (12), and whose second end is non-rotatably 

held to the pivotable member (25) of the hinge (23), which is 
secured to the cover (13). 
A balance according to one of claims 2 and 3 characterised in 
that the spring (39) is of a rectangular or a round cross-section. 
A balance according to one of claims 2 to 4 characterised in 
that the hinge (23, 123) has two mounting blocks (29) arranged on the 

pivotable member (25), each having a respective mounting pin (31, 131) 
non-rotatably held thereto, and that two spaced-apart holding means for  

 
receiving the front ends of the mounting pins (31, 131) are secured to 

the fixed member (27). 
A balance according to claim 2 characterised in that the ends of 
the springs (39) are non-rotatably held in the mounting pin (31) and 

that the central portion of the spring (39) is non-rotatably connected 
to the cover (13). 
A balance according to claim 1 characterised in that at least 
one coil spring (139) is pushed onto a shaft (131) forming the axis of 

rotation of the hinge (123), the tangentially projecting ends (140) of 
the spring, which are disposed at an angle relative to each other, each 

being arranged to bear against one of the walls (112) and the cover 
(113) respectively. 
A balance according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in 
that the lower edges of the side walls (11, 111) Which laterally close 

off the draught-proofing arrangement (9, 109) are fitted in a frame 
(21), at the underside of which is provided at least one groove-like 

recess or a groove (55) into which plate portions (51) on the balance 
housing (3) engage, and that provided on the plate portions (51) is a 

horizontally extending channel or step (53) Which is latchably engaged 
by a retaining spring (59) secured to the underside of the frame (21) 

and projecting into the groove (55), when the draught-proofing 
arrangement (9) is fitted onto the balance housing (3). 
A balance according to claim 8 characterised in that the portion 
of the retaining spring (59), which projects into the groove (55), 

extends at an acute angle relative to the vertical and is secured to the 
frame (21) in a position of being oriented towards the centre of the 

draught-proofing arrangement (9). 
A balance according to one of claims 8 and 9 characterised in  
 

that the retaining spring (59) is arranged on the side of the frame (21) 
opposite the hinge (23) for the cover (13). 
A balance according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in 
that the lower edges of the lateral walls (211) forming the draught-proofing 

arrangement (209) are fitted into a frame (221), at the 
underside of Which is provided a groove (255) into Which plate portions 

(251) on the balance housing (203) engage, and that provided in the 
plate portions (251) are slots (265) Which extend inclinedly relative to 

the vertical and into which pins (263) fitted in the groove (255) engage 
when the draught-proofing arrangement (209) is put on.
