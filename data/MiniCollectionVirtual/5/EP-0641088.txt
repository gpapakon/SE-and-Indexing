<ABSTRACT>
A wireless telephone device 
(1) is provided with a lead switch 

(13) arranged between a wireless 
unit (12) and a rod antenna (15) 

in the telephone set main body 
(10), which connects the wireless 

unit (12) and the rod antenna (15) 
to each other when the telephone 

set main body (10) is off a car kit 
(20). The car kit is provided with 

a magnet (27) which magnetically 
energizes the lead switch (13) 

when the telephone set main body 
(10) is placed on the car kit (20) 

so that the lead switch (13) is 
turned into a mode where the 

wireless unit (12) and an external 
antenna (26) are connected to 

each other. Hence it is possible to 
execute switching the antenna line 

between the rod antenna (15) of 
the telephone set main body (10) 

and the external antenna (21) of 
the car kit without inviting any increase 

in the consumption of electric 
current and without making 

the circuits more complicated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio communication apparatuses and more
particularly to an antenna line switching structure in a radio communication apparatus
including a mobile unit which is capable of making communications by itself and an
adapter to which the mobile unit is removably attached, in which when the mobile unit
is separated from the adapter, a first antenna in the mobile unit is used for
communication while when the mobile unit is connected to the adapter, a second
antenna in the adapter is used for communication.As one of the conventional radio communication apparatuses of this type, a radio
telephone device A is shown in Fig. 8. The radio telephone device A is provided with a
telephone set main body B as a mobile unit and a car kit C as an adapter. An example
of such a radio communication of this type is given in EP-A-0 412 852. The telephone set main body B is provided with a radio
section (not shown) within its casing and a rod antenna
Ba (a first antenna) extending outwardly which is used
when the telephone set main body B is used as a portable
telephone set.The car kit C is fixed in a car and connected through an
external cable D to an external antenna E (a second
antenna). When the telephone set main body B is
attached to the car kit C and connected with a connector
cord Ca, the radio section (not shown) in the telephone
set main body B and the external antenna E are connected
to each other, whereby the telephone set main body B is
used as a car-mounted telephone set with the use of the
external antenna E.As shown in parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 9, in the radio
telephone device A, a high frequency relay R is used to
switch an antenna line between the rod antenna Ba and
the external antenna E.The high frequency relay R is disposed within the casing
of the telephone set main body B. Terminals a and b of
the relay R are connected to a radio section F and the
rod antenna Ba, respectively. When the telephone set 
main body B is disconnected from the car kit C, the
terminals a and b are connected to each other through a
movable spring contact Ra, whereby the radio section F
is connected through the high frequency relay R to the
rod antenna Ba so that telephonic communication is made
through the rod antenna Ba.When the telephone set main body B is attached to the
car kit C and connected with the connector cord Ca, the
external antenna E is connected to a terminal c of the
relay R, as shown in the part (b) of Fig. 9. Supply of
an electric current between coil terminals d and e of
