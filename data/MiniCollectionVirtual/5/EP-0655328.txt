<ABSTRACT>
In an inking device for a gravure rotary printing machine, ink is prevented from settling on the end faces of the gravure forme cylinder (4) due to the fact that a face length (m) of the forme cylinder projects beyond the length of the ink trough (2) on each side by the amount of a part length (x;y). This avoids having to assemble and dismantle ink splash guards when changing the forme cylinder.

Inking unit for a rotor gravure printing machine,
having an ink trough (2), an inking roller (3), a forme

cylinder (4) and a doctor device (27) that acts on the
outer surface of the forme cylinder (4),


the ink trough (2) being arranged underneath the

forme cylinder (4), which dips into gravure printing
ink (1),
a clear length (l) of the ink trough (2) being less
than a face length (m) of the forme cylinder (4),
each end (8, 9) of the ink trough (2) having, on its
side facing the forme cylinder (4), a cut-out with

a gap (11) that is matched to a radius (s) of the
forme cylinder (4) and is located below the highest

level of the gravure printing ink (1).
Inking unit according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the face length (m) of the forme cylinder (4) is

equal to the length (l) of the ink trough (2) plus external
projections (x, y) on both sides.
Inking unit according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the two projections (x, y) are equally

long, i.e. x equals y.
Inking unit according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the two projections (x, y) are of different

lengths, i.e. x is not equal to y.
Inking unit according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that nozzles (31, 32), which are directed

towards the region of the projections (x, y) of the forme
cylinder (4) which project beyond the ink trough (2), are

provided in order to spray these projections (x, y) with
solvent for gravure printing ink (1).
