<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method and a circuit arrangement for carrying out the method in order to generate a pseudorandom sequence of bit data, using a shift register device (1, 2, 5) with feedback. After a sequence of switching states of the shift register device (1), by means of which it is determined whether the bit data should be output, the bit data are output. The method and the circuit arrangement are preferably used for encrypting data, particularly for the authenticity detection of a data carrier arrangement, for example of chip cards.

Method for generating a pseudo-random sequence 
of bit data using a feedback shift register device (1, 

2, 5), output signals of the shift register device (1) 
being fed as input variable to a non-linear logical 

function, and outputting of the bit data being carried 
out in a manner dependent on the logical output signal 

of the non-linear logical function,
 
characterized
 
in that the logical output signal of the non-linear 

logical function is fed as clock signal to a counter 
device (10), and in that when a predetermined counter 

reading of the counter device (10) is reached, a 
logical signal is generated which results in the 

outputting of the bit data from the shift register 
device (1). 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the bit data, under the control 

of the logical signal generated by the counter device 
(10), are accepted into a buffer store (8), and in that 

at least one bit datum stored in the buffer store (8) 
is output at defined instants. 
Method according to Claim 2,
 
characterized in that a further counter device (12) is 

controlled by the shift register clock, and in that 
when a defined counter reading of the further counter 

device (12) is reached, a logical signal is generated  
 

by means of which the outputting from the buffer store 
(8) is controlled. 
Circuit arrangement for carrying out the method 
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, formed by a feedback 

shift register device (1, 2, 5) which contains a 
multiplicity of cascaded shift register cells, 

predetermined shift register cells being connected, on 
the output side, to a circuit (9) which realizes a non-linear 

logical function,
 
characterized
 
in that the clock input of a first counter device (10) 

is connected to an output (14) of the circuit (9), in 
that a buffer store (8) is connected, on the input 

side, to at least one of the shift register cells, in 
that a clock control input of the buffer store (8) is 

controlled by a logic device which decodes a counter 
reading of the first counter device (10), in that a 

switching device (11) is connected to at least one 
output of the buffer store (8), and in that the 

switching device (11) is controlled by a logic device 
which decodes a switching state of a second counter 

device (12). 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 4,
 
characterized in that the clock signal controls of the 

shift register (1) and of the second counter device 
(12) are coupled. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 4 or 5,
 
characterized in that the logic devices connected to 

the first and second counter devices (10, 12) in each 
case decode the overflow of the first and second 

counter device (10 and 12, respectively). 
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 
4 to 6,
 
characterized in that the switching device (11) is a 

logic gate. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 
4 to 7,
  
 

characterized in that the word width of the second 
counter device (12) is at least twice the word width of 

the first counter device (10). 
Use of the method according to one of Claims 1 
to 3 or of the circuit arrangement according to one of 

Claims 4 to 8 in a data carrier arrangement, in 
particular a smart card with an integrated circuit 

arrangement, for identifying authenticity. 
Use of the method according to one of Claims 1 
to 3 or of the circuit arrangement according to one of 

Claims 4 to 8 for the encryption and/or decryption of 
data.
