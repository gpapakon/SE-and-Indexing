<ABSTRACT>
In a node of a communication network, all information sections of the data structure handled including leader, trailer and parallel information, header and information field, can be selectively read with the aid of a reading mask (12) allocated to the reader (11). A combination of a writing device (14) and a writing mask (15) is used for selectively writing the data structure in all information sections. The length of the leader or trailer can be increased for increasing the capacity for accommodating information in the data structure. In the line path between an input interface (10) and the writing device (14), an adjustable delay device (13) is arranged into which the data structure can be read undivided. A microprocessor (25) is coupled to all processing units (10..17, 22..24) of the arrangement and is used for presetting the two masks for selecting the information to be read and written.
