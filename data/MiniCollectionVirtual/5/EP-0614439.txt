<CLAIMS>
Aerosol device for dispensing a composition with 
relatively high viscosity, in particular a gel or an 

emulsion, comprising a can intended to be used with the 
head upwards, containing the composition and a pressurized 

gaseous propellant agent acting directly on the 
composition, a dispensing valve being placed at the upper 

part of the can on an opening of this can, while a dip-tube 
connected to the valve extends as far as the vicinity 

of the bottom of the can, characterized in that the 
composition (C) to be dispensed has a viscosity (measured 

on a Brookfield DV III viscometer, needle no. 7) lying in 
the range of 4000 to 10,000 millipascal.second, preferably 

of 6000 to 8000 millipascal.second, for a speed of 
100 revolutions/minute and of 30,000 to 150,000 millipascal.second, 

preferably of 50,000 to 120,000 millipascal.second, 
for a speed of 2.5 revolutions/minute, and 

in that the dip-tube consists of a semi-capillary tube 
(18) whose internal diameter (
e
) lies between 0.7 and 
1.5 mm. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the internal diameter of the semi-capillary tube 

(18) lies between 1.3 and 1.5 mm. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the valve (5) is fitted with a tail (14) which 

includes a cylindrical housing (15) in which the upper 
end of the capillary tube (18) is engaged, the outer 

surface of which bears against the inner surface of the 
housing (15). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that its emptying ratio is at least 80%. 
Device according to one the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pressure of the propellant 

agent in the case of a compressed gas lies between 5 and 
10 bar, while in the case of 2-H-heptafluoropropane, the 

pressure is approximately 3.5 bar, and in that the 
initial composition delivery rate lies between 1 g/s and 

6.5 g/s.
