<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits of 
the memory type, such as stand-alone SRAMs or logic arrays 
with embedded SRAM macros, provided with built-in self-test 
capabilities for logic and memory fault detection, 
and fabricated in semiconductor chips. It more particularly 
relates to a novel fast high density data compression 
circuit to be used therein. As memories get faster, more 
complex, and denser, there is an increasing demand on 
ABIST (Array Built-In Self-Test) structures offering high 
speed and high test coverage, while consuming minimal area 
on the semiconductor chip. For sake of illustration, Fig. 1 shows the block diagram 
architecture of a state of the art SRAM macro 10 provided 
with an ABIST unit 11. A similar architecture is described 
in Ref. D1: US-A-5 173 906 assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention. The functional units shown in Fig. 1, 
either form a part of a stand-alone SRAM or the SRAM macro 
of a logic array of an integrated circuit chip. In the 
latter case, the chip may include a plurality of such 
macros, each being provided with its own dedicated ABIST 
unit. The said integrated circuit chip is part of a wafer 
fabricated in a very large scale integration (VLSI) semiconductor 
technology and is designed according to level-sensitive 
scan design (LSSD) rules. As known for those ordinary skilled in the art, the SRAM 
macro 10 of Fig. 1 has three basic operating modes. The 
first one is the SYSTEM mode, according to which the SRAM 
macro 10 is in normal operation, i.e. where the memory 
unit 12 is either read or written, using the data-in signals  
 
DATAIN1 to DATAINM, the SRAM address signals ADDIN1 
to ADDINP, and the read/write control signal R/WIN (wherein 
M and P are the respective bit widths of the data-in 
bus DATAIN and the SRAM address bus ADDIN). The second 
mode is required because of the LSSD construction: the 
SCAN mode which is used for initializing/analyzing (SCAN-IN/SCAN-OUT) 
all the data of the latch pairs, which are 
used extensively in the SRAM macro architecture of Fig. 1, 
to form the LSSD chain. Finally, the third mode is the 
ABIST mode, in which the memory unit 12 functionality is 
tested. It is a self-test which is first performed in the 
manufacturing environment, before the chip is commercially 
released. A slightly different, more relaxed self-test is 
performed while the chip is incorporated in a system, for 
example at the customer location, and thus in the system 
environment. As a result, the ABIST mode is used in
