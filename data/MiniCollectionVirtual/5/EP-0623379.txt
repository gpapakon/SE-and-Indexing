<ABSTRACT>
In a waste disposal unit sludge is incinerated to produce waste gases which contains mercury. The novelty is that the gases pass through a single or multi-stage washing system using an alkaline solution to remove acid gases, and that the mercury is subsequently separated in a second-stage washer using an aqueous acid solution. Pref. the second-stage washer uses chloride and an oxidant. A further washing stage reduces the HCl emissions value to less than 10 mg/m2 in the normal condition.

<CLAIMS>
Process for cleaning flue gases evolving from sewage sludge incineration 
plants and containing elementary mercury, with their SO
2
 concentration 
exceeding the HCl concentration in flue gas by a multiple, 
characterized in 
that
 SO
2
 and other acid contaminant gases are separated from the flue 
gases in a single or multiple-stage scrubber system in an alkaline solution 

and that elementary mercury is separated downstream in a scrubbing stage 
with a hydrous acid solution, preferably with a pH-value under 5. 
Process pursuant to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 chlorides, preferably 
NaCl, HCl, or FeCl
3
 are added to the scrubbing stage downstream. 
Process pursuant to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 that oxidation agents, 
preferably HgCl
2
 sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide are added to the 
scrubbing stage downstream during the start-up phase. 
Process pursuant to at least one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in 
that
 a further scrubbing stage is installed behind the scrubbing stage 
downstream in order to reduce the HCl emission value down to 
>
 10 mg/cbm 
in normal status. 
Process pursuant to at least one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in 
that
 the flue gases cleaned in the scrubbing stages are conducted through a 
mist eliminator prior to their evacuation into the atmosphere. 
Process pursuant to at least one of the Claims 1, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterized in 
that
 that bromide and iodide ions are added to the scrubbing stage 
downstream.
