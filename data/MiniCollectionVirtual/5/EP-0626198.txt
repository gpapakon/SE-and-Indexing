<ABSTRACT>
A dump tank (20) for receiving congealable material 
vented from a chemical process, the dump tank having two 

access doors (14, 15) covering two access ports (2a, 3a), both 
doors being openable for cleaning purposes so that congealable 

material vented into the tank can be pushed out of one access 
port from the other port.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dump tank and has particular 
reference to an emergency dump tank for the retention of 
congealable material. The invention has further particular, but not necessarily 
exclusive, reference to a dump tank for use in the containment 
of solutions of cellulose in aqueous organic compounds - 
typically n-methyl morpholine n-oxide (NMMO). Cellulosic fibres have attractive absorbency and comfort 
characteristics and are widely used in the production of 
products such as garments and absorbency products. Certain 
cellulosic fibres occur in nature - such as cotton. Other 
cellulosic fibres are produced by the formation of a chemical 
compound of cellulose to produce a spinnable solution which 
is extruded or spun into a regeneration bath to form the 
fibres. Viscose rayon is an example of such a fibre. More recently techniques have been developed for the 
production of extruded cellulosic products (in particular 
fibres) by the dissolution of cellulose in an aqueous organic 
solvent for cellulose. Such fibres have been given the 
generic term "lyocell fibres". A preferred solvent for cellulose is a tertiary amine 
oxide, in particular NMMO. Although cellulose can form a stable solution in an 
aqueous n-methyl morpholine solvent, the solution can become 
an exotherm if the temperature of the solution rises above a 
predetermined level. Once under way, an exotherm comprises 
an uncontrollable chemical reaction characterised by the 
release of excessive quantities of thermal energy in a very  
 
short period of time. Because the solution of cellulose in 
aqueous NMMO is relatively viscous - although thixotropic - 
one of the characteristics of an exotherm is the displacement 
of solution as a result of the formation of gases in the 
exotherm. Unstabilised solutions gradually degrade, in doing 
so they emit heat. This can cause a runaway reaction once the 
temperature of the solution reaches about 170°C. Stabilised 
solutions using stabilisers such as propyl gallate reach 
runaway reactions temperatures at about 180°C. Proposals have been made, therefore, to provide safety 
relief devices to relieve pressure and material in the event 
of an exotherm. The document DE-A-1 800 061 discloses a polymerisation reactor which 
is provided with an emergency dump tank. The present invention is concerned with an emergency dump 
tank for the retention of congealable material produced, in 
a particular example, by an exotherm occurring in a pipeline 
containing a solution of cellulose in aqueous

<CLAIMS>
A dump tank (20) for the reception of a congealable 
material vented from a chemical process, characterised in that 

the tank (20) defines a chamber (17) communicating with at 
least one entry line (7, 8, 9) for the entry of congealable 

material into said chamber (17) and a pair of access ports 
(2a, 3a) openable in said tank to permit removal of 

congealable material from said chamber (17) by opening both 
of said access ports (2a, 3a) and pushing congealable material 

from one of said ports out of the chamber (17) through the 
other of said ports. 
A tank as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the tank is in the form of a cylinder (1) having a flange (2, 

3) at each end, the access ports (2a, 3a) being formed by 
blanking plates (14, 15) secured to said flanges (2, 3). 
A dump tank as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that said chamber (17) has a vapour vent line 

(10) connected to a vapour exit port located in an upper 
region of said chamber (17) which has a vapour exit (11) open 

to the atmosphere, a seal (12) being provided to prevent the 
atmosphere entering said chamber (17) via said vapour vent 

line (10) during non-emergency rest conditions of said tank 
(20), said seal (12) being openable under the action of a 

sufficient pressure in said dump tank so as to permit said 
vapour vent line (10) to be in gaseous communication with said 

surrounding atmosphere, and means (18, 19) to maintain an 
inert atmosphere in said chamber (17) in use of said tank. 
A process for safely venting a solution of cellulose 
in an aqueous n-methyl morpholine n-oxide solvent from a 

pipeline following an exotherm of said solution, characterised 

in that the process includes the steps of:- 

(i) transporting said solution via a dump line (7, 8, 
9) to a dump tank (20) defining a chamber (17),  

 
(ii) said chamber (17) communicating with an entry port 
for said dump line (7, 8, 9), a vapour exit port 

(10) communicating to atmosphere and at least two 
access ports (2a, 3a) having openable access doors 

(14, 15). 
(iii) permitting at least partial cooling and congealing 
of said solution in said chamber (17), 
(iv) opening both of said access doors (14, 15) to 
permit access to said chamber (17), and 
(v) pushing said at least partially congealable 
solution out of the chamber (17) via one of said 

access ports by pushing on said at least partially 
congealable solution from the other of said access 

ports. 
The process of claim 4, characterised in that the 
chamber (17) contains an inert atmosphere. 
The process of claim 4, characterised in that the 
inert atmosphere is nitrogen. 
The process of claim 5, characterised in that the 
vapour exit port (10) communicates to the atmosphere via a 

line containing a seal (12), said seal (12) being openable 
under the influence of a sufficient pressure rise within the 

dump tank.
