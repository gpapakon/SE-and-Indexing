<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bakers yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has improved temperature 
tolerance and/or keeping quality. Bakers yeast is typically produced by a fed-batch 
fermentation process at temperatures up to about 35°C. 
Above this temperature both yield and baking performance 
are usually compromised. Unfortunately, considerable heat 
is generated during fermentation and the fermentors must 
be cooled to maintain optimum conditions for yeast growth. 
Due to the large culture volumes involved in commercial 
fermentations (typically around 100,000 litres) cooling 
can represent a substantial component of overall 
production costs, particularly in countries which 
experience high summer temperatures. A strain which can 
tolerate even small increases in production temperature, 
without significant loss of baking performance, is 
therefore desirable. Another important feature in a bakers yeast product 
is its keeping quality. This is the ability of the 
product (at 17-34% solids) to retain its baking activity 
during a period of storage. Depending on the availability 
of bakery refrigeration, the conditions of such storage 
may range from around 4°C to in excess of 25°C. The present inventor has produced a bakers yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain which is improved in 
respect to both temperature tolerance and storage 
characteristics. A sample of this yeast strain, 
designated YTTS, was deposited with Australian Government 
Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) at 1 Suakin Street, Pymble, 
New South Wales 2073, Australia on 11 March 1993 and was 
accorded Accession No. N93/10504. Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention 
consists in a baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
strain, the strain being characterised in that there is 
less than a 12% decrease in yield of grams of wet yeast at  
 
30% solids per 100g total reducing sugar when the strain is 
brewed at 37°C in comparison to brewing at 30°C. In a second aspect the present invention consists in 
a baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, the strain 
being characterised in that the strain retains at least 90% 
of its activity in plain dough at 37°C when brewed at 37°C 
in comparison to when brewed at 30°C. In a third aspect the present invention consists in 
a baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, the 
strain being characterised in that the strain brewed at 
30°C retains at least 95%, and preferably at least 97%, of 
its activity after storage for 21 days at 4°C at 24.5% 
solids. The present invention
