<ABSTRACT>
An organ support system and method adapted for use with a patient (200) and designed to modify the blood from the patient includes a control system (410), a venous line (2) coupled to an output of a patient, an arterial line (3) coupled to an input of the patient, and a cell line inserted into a hollow fiber cartridge (1) to form an organ assist device. Blood is passed through the organ assist device (1). A small flow is extracted from the extra-capillary space to check the integrity of the organ assist device. With this closed loop arrangement (110), a proper fluid balance can be maintained for the patient without requiring any dialysate, and leaks from the cell line to the patient can be immediately detected and prevented from reaching the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ORGAN SUPPORT SYSTEMThis application incorporates herein by reference U.S. Patent Application No. 07/524,075, filed on May 16, 1991, U.S. Patent Application No. 07/965,448 (the Continuation-in-Part of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/524,075), filed on October 23, 1992, and PCT Publication No. WO 91/18087.The present invention relates to an organ support system and method for sustaining a patient, and more particularly to an organ support system having a cell line which mimics or supports the function of a specific bodily organ e.g., liver, kidney, etc. The embodiment of the invention discussed in detail below is directed to the liver, but it is envisioned that the support system can be used for other organs. The components of the system include a hollow fiber cartridge, biologically active cells which could be a continuously cultured cell line, and a pumping system.Hollow Fiber CartridgesBriefly, hollow fiber cartridges consist of a tube which contains a plurality of hollow fibers. The hollow fibers can be made of a number of substances such as polysulfone or cellulose acetate, and may vary in diameter. The cartridge has two spaces; an intracapillary space (ICS) and an extracapillary space (ECS) . The ICS is the space comprised of the interior of the fibers, and is accessed through the end ports of the cartridge. The ECS is the space between the outside of the fibers and the shell of the cartridge, and is accessed through the side ports as shown, for example, in Figure 1. These two spaces are the basis of 

hemodialysis; a continuous stream of blood passes through one space and is dialyzed against a continuous stream of fluid (i.e. , a dialysate) which passes through the other space. The nature of the membrane dictates the type of exchange which takes place between these two streams, but transfer of water and small-to- medium-sized molecules is usually the goal. Blood is usually passed through the intracapillary space since flow is less turbulent, and clotting is reduced. The system would function in the reverse orientation, i.e., blood in the ECS, dialysate in the ICS. The description in this application refers to the conventional orientation of blood flow for convenience, but it is recognized that the system may work equally well in the reverse orientation.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is known that the acute loss of more than 60% of liver function is a serious risk to survival. It is also known that patients with chronic liver insufficiency may have periods when a metabolic stress such as surgery or
