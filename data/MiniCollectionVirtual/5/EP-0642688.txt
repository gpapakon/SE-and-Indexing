<ABSTRACT>
A lattice type carrier for separate product identification labels and package size/price labels. The carrier is secured to the back of a vandal resistant front selection panel having one or more transparent windows for the labels mounted on the carrier. The carrier, moreover, includes an arrangement of generally rectangular frame type openings wherein translucent product identification labels are mounted and back-lighted. Also, the package size/price labels may either be mounted in relatively smaller frame type openings in the carrier above the respective product identification labels or adhesively mounted to the front surface of the carrier or above the product identification areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coin operated vending machine apparatus for soft 
drink bottles or cans, and more particularly to back lighted vendor selection panel assemblies 
therefor, including changeable labels for product identification, package size and price. The majority of conventional soft drink vending apparatus permits only one package 
size to be vended in each machine. In addition, the control systems in these vending 
machines require that each selection have the same vend price. This type of equipment is 
referred to as single price vending equipment. In this single price environment, it is only 
necessary to inform the consumer of the product associated with each selection button. Since 
all packages and prices are identical, a central price/package label is adequate to inform the 
consumer of this critical information. New generation vending equipment, however, features flexible vend mechanisms that 
allow multiple size and design packages to be used in a single machine. In addition, new 
control system designs permit each selection to have a unique vend price. These new capabilities require that each selection's flavor, package size and price be 
communicated to the consumer. One method to achieve this in existing equipment is to add 
this information to the flavor label. This approach, however, has many operational, cost and 
inventory deficiencies since labels for a given flavor would have to be printed on all possible 
package and price combinations. This necessitates either a new product label size or a 
greatly reduced flavor trademark identification area. These solutions provide inherent 
limitations which are not acceptable in terms of flavor label inventory issues and consumer 
communications issues. Equipment designs of the prior art are known to include label retention means in the 
vending machine front selection panel. However, this requirement mandates an injection 
molded part with molded label retention devices. These retention devices and the general 
layout of components in the door of the vending machine make it extremely difficult to gain 
access to the product labels for initial set up at the factory or changes in the field. This 
restriction, moreover, limits the practical thickness of the front selection panel and creates 
voids in openings in the panel which weaken this area of the machine. These weak points are 
known to have become specific target areas for vandals in their efforts to gain unauthorized 
entry into the vending machine. US-A-4 682 709

<CLAIMS>
A vending machine (10) including a product selection front panel assembly comprising: 

a damage resistant front selection panel (32) having at least one label viewing section (34) for 
reading at least one indicia bearing label (64) located behind said panel; and CHARACTERISED BY 
a label carrier member (58) secured to a rear surface of said front selection panel (32) and 
having at least one frame type opening (60) and label holding means (62) in registration with said 

at least one label viewing section (34) for holding said at least one label (64). 
The vending machine of claim 1 wherein said front selection panel (32) includes a 
plurality of label viewing sections (34) and said label carrier member (58) includes a like plurality of 

frame type openings (60) therein having respective label holding means (62) in registration with said 
plurality of label viewing sections (34). 
The vending machine of claim 2 wherein said plurality of label viewing sections (34) 
comprise a plurality of mutually aligned transparent window sections (34) and wherein said label 

carrier member (58) comprises an elongated lattice type structure and said plurality of frame type 
openings (60) comprise a plurality of mutually aligned frame type openings (60) located behind said 

window sections (34). 
The vending machine of claim 3 wherein said label carrier member (58) comprises a 
back-lighted label carrier member (58), said at least one label (64) comprises a translucent label (64), and 

additionally including means (72) for back-lighting said label carrier member (58) and said label (64). 
The vending machine of claim 4 wherein said label carrier member (58) is of a 
relatively darker color than a front surface of said panel so as to provide a contrasting 

frame-like appearance for said at least one label (64). 
The vending machine of claim 5 wherein said label carrier member (58) 
includes respective second frame-type openings (66) adjacent said like plurality of frame-type 

openings (60) and including label holding means (68) for holding at least one other indicia bearing 
label (70) in registration with one of said transparent window sections (34). 
The vending machine of claim 6 wherein said respective second 
frame-type openings (66) are relatively smaller in size than said like plurality of frame-type 

openings (60) and wherein said indicia bearing label (64) including product identification information 
is relatively larger in size than said other indicia bearing label (70) including product size/price 

information.  
 
The vending machine of claim 3 and additionally including means 42,44,50,52 for 
securing said label carrier member (58) to said rear surface of said front selection panel (32). 
The vending machine of claim 8 wherein said securing means includes a 
pair of elements (42,44) projecting outwardly from the rear surface of said front selection panel (32) and 

additionally including a pair of apertures (52,50) in said label carrier member (58) for engaging said 
outwardly projecting elements. 
The vending machine of claim 9 wherein said outwardly projecting 
elements on the rear surface of said front selection panel (32) includes a first element (42) located on a 

top portion (46) of said rear surface of said panel (32) and a second member (44) located on a bottom 
portion (48) of said rear surface of said panel (32). 
The vending machine of claim 10 wherein said first outwardly projecting 
element (42) comprises a mounting tab of generally rectangular cross section and said second 

outwardly projecting element (44) comprises a mounting stud of generally circular cross section 
and wherein said pair of apertures in said label carrier member (58) includes a generally 

rectangular mounting notch (50) in a top portion (54) of said label carrier member and a mounting 
hole (52) in a bottom portion (56) of said label carrier member.
