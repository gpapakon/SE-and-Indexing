<CLAIMS>
A process for increasing the apparent density of 
spray-dried detergents, in which the spray-dried granular 

material is sprayed simultaneously or successively with a 
liquid nonionic surfactant and an aqueous solution of an 

alkali metal silicate in a mixing unit. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the mixing 
unit comprises a horizontally arranged mixing drum in which 

mixing tools rotate on a horizontal shaft. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, in which the liquids 
are introduced through nozzles arranged in the wall of the 

drum. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which a low-phosphate 
or phosphate-free detergent is used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which - based 
on the spray-dried detergent used - 0.5 to 10% by weight 

and preferably 1 to 7% by weight of liquid nonionic surfactant 
and 0.5 to 5% by weight and preferably 1 to 3% by 

weight of alkali metal silicate are applied in the form of 
an aqueous solution. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
quantity of liquid nonionic surfactant and the quantity of 

silicate solution sprayed onto the tower powder in the 
mixing unit are in a ratio by weight of 2:1 to 1:2.
