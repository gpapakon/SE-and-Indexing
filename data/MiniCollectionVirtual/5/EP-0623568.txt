<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and the associated apparatus for the utilisation (valorisation) of mixtures of combustible organic substances and clay or carboniferous clay by recovery of a tar-free CO-containing and H2-containing combustion gas and coarse ceramic products (building ceramics) or components. For this purpose, the mixtures shaped into green bodies are subjected in a chamber (1) to heat treatment in a steam-containing reducing atmosphere by direct contact with a steam-containing circulating gas which is circulated and heated before this contact in a circulating gas heater (15, 23). In this heat treatment, there takes place at temperatures of up to 200@C the drying of the green bodies, at temperatures of 200-700@C the pyrolysis of the organic substance and a ceramic consolidation of the green bodies, at temperatures of 700-900@C the gasification of the carbon formed during pyrolysis, a further ceramic consolidation of the green bodies and a leach-proof binding-in of environmentally significant heavy metals which can be completed at temperatures above 900@C.

Process for recycling mixtures of combustible organic substances and clay or culm 
clay, in particular mixtures of solid residues from the pyrolysis of waste and clay or 

culm clay, by recovering a tar-free CO- and H
2
-containing combustion gas and 
heavy clay products or components, the said mixtures being moulded into blanks 

and subjected to heat treatment up to a maximum of 900°C in a water vapour-containing 
reducing atmosphere and the clayey material fraction being ceramically 

strengthened under these conditions, wherein, in a furnace chamber or a chamber 
(1) by means of direct contact with a water vapour-containing circulated gas 

heated in a circulated-gas heater (15, 23) prior to this contact, the blanks are 
successively 


a) heated and dried at temperatures of up to approximately 200°C, the water 
vapour released by the drying being absorbed by the circulated gas, and 
b) heated to temperatures of up to approximately 700°C, the pyrolysis of the 
combustible constituents being effected with the release 
of the volatile 
constituents and the ceramic strengthening taking place in a water vapour-containing 

reducing atmosphere, and the volatile constituents released being 
absorbed by the circulated gas and toxic hydrocarbons contained in the volatile 

constituents, e.g. tar vapours, being converted during the heating of the 
circulated gas together with the water vapour contained in the circulated gas 

into simple substances which are non-toxic during normal handling, such as H
2
, 
CO, CH
4
 and other non-condensable hydrocarbons, 
c) at temperatures of between 700°C and 900°C, what is referred to as residual 
carbon remaining in the blank after pyrolysis is converted together with the
