<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYPEPTIDES OBTAINABLE FROM SPECIES OF FASCIOLA,AND VACCINES, METHODS OF TREATMENT ANDDNA SEQUENCES OF THE SAMEThe present invention relates generally to a vaccine and more particularly to a vaccine useful in reducing spread of the liver fluke parasite and to polypeptides useful for same. The present invention also relates to a method of reducing spread of infection of liver fluke.Bibliographic details of the publications referred to in this specification are collected at the end of the description. Sequence Identity Numbers (SEQ ID NOs.) for the nucleotide and amino acid sequences referred to in the specification and figures are defined following the bibliography.Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers.cDNA clones "ICEA" and "ICEB" referred to in Australian provisional application No. PL7109 filed on 5 February, 1993 and from which the present application claims priority are re-named herein "Fhcatl" and "Fhcat2", respectively.Helminths such as trematode parasites (flukes) are a major cause of economic loss in domestic animals as well as causing serious disease in humans (Haroun and Hillyer, 1986). The major trematodes of economic or public health importance are Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica, Fasciola magna, Schistosoma bovis, Schistosoma matthei, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma japonicum, Paramphistomum microbothium, Gigantocotyle explanatum, Dicrocoelium dendnticum, Eurytremapancr aticum,Paragonimuswestermani, Clonorchis sinensisand Opisthorchis viverrini (Spithill, 1992). Infection of humans by S. mÎ±nsoni, S. haematobium, S, 

japonicum, C. sinensis-, O. viverrini, F. hepatica, F. gigantica and P. westermani is common in developing countries. Schistosoma spp. infect over 200 million people and cause disease by depositing parasite eggs in the tissues of the host causing a granulomatous immune response (McManus et al, 1993). The life cycles of all trematodes involve the release of eggs from adult parasites. These eggs produce a miracidia that invades the intermediate host (mollusc) leading to the eventual release of forms infective to mammalian hosts. Fascioliasis is caused by infection with the trematode parasite Fasciola hepatica This infection is of particular economic
