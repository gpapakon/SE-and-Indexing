<ABSTRACT>
The strength of a glass ply (1), which has been chemically 
strengthened, for example by acid etching of its surface, is 

maintained by melting a thermoplastic material (2,3), preferably 
polyurethane, onto the glass surface prior to the incorporation of 

the glass ply into a required laminate. The invention is useful 
for production of glass plies for incorporation into high strength 

glazings, and is especially useful when weight is important, for 
example in aircraft glazings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of treating strengthened 
glass to maintain the strength of the glass, to strengthened glass 
components so treated, to laminated glazings comprising such 
components, and to a method of bonding a layer of polyurethane to 
glass. It has previously been proposed to enhance the strength of 
glass by etching the glass surface to remove or reduce flaws 
therein which might serve as a site for the initiation of cracks 
in the glass. This has been done by acid etching or polishing 
which removes glass stock by dissolving away the glass, so either 
removing the flaws or at least smoothing the bottoms of the flaws 
thereby reducing the stress concentrating effect caused by the 
flaws in glass subjected to bending forces. Thus it has previously been proposed, for example in Swiss 
patent specification 367 942 dated 1958 and US patent 3 711 263 
dated 1969, to enhance the strength of glass by etching the 
surface up to a depth of 80 or 20 microns respectively to remove 
surface defects and thereby strengthen the glass; the patent 
specifications suggest applying silica or an inorganic layer over 
the etched surface as a protective or hard layer. According to 
the Swiss patent specification, optimal strengthening may be 
achieved by thermal treatment of the glass directly after etching  
 
and before provision of a protective layer. According to the US 
patent the glass treated is chemically toughened before etching. GB patent specification 1 359 165 dated 1974 relates to 
laminated glass for use in buildings and vehicles; it teaches 
subjecting a face of a glass pane to a rectifying treatment which 
reduces the impairment of that face by faults liable to cause 
stress concentrations when tensioning forces are applied to the 
glass pane, and using that pane in a laminate with the face which 
has been subject to the rectifying treatment located internally of 
the laminate. The rectifying treatments described include fire 
polishing and chemical dissolution (etching). Because the etched 
face is protected within the laminate (the invention is indicated 
to be especially suitable for production of laminated automotive 
windscreens), it is used in contact with an interlayer material 
used in the laminate, typically polyvinylbutyral. The fact that the strength of glass may be enhanced by 
etching or other surface treatment to remove or modify surface 
faults, and that the etched surface may subsequently be protected 
by coating or used in contact with a thermoplastic layer within a 
lam
