<ABSTRACT>
A lining holder disc for producing a friction disc, particularly for motor vehicles, comprising a central portion (16) and a peripheral portion split up into radial blades (672) circumferentially alternated with a series of radial tongues (671) in the plane of said central portion (16). Said blades (672) have plies (421) thus forming a central bearing zone (423) and two peripheral bearing zones (422) on either side of the central zone (423), said peripheral zones (422) being axially offset relative to said central zone (423). Some or all of said tongues (671) have a ply (621) thus forming a bearing zone (622) which is axially offset towards said central zone of the blades (672).

Lining-holder disc suitable for constituting a friction disc, 
notably for a motor vehicle, of the kind having a central portion 

(16) and a peripheral portion divided into radial blades (672) 
alternating circumferentially with a series of radial tongues 

(671) in the same plane as the central portion (16) of the 
lining-holder disc, in which the blades (672) exhibit, by means 

of folds (421), a central support zone (423) and two peripheral 
support zones (422) on either side of the said zone (423), the 

said peripheral zones (422) being offset axially with respect to 
the said central zone (423), characterised in that at least some 

of the said tongues (671) exhibit, by means of a connecting fold 
(621), at least one support zone (622) offset axially in the 

direction of the central zone of the blades (672). 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the support zone (622) is formed at the free end of the 

tongue (671). 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the said tongues (671) have a free end (622, 621) which is 

reduced in width circumferentially. 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the tongues have a shape in which they are tapered towards 

their outer periphery, so that the root zone in which they are 
joined to the central portion (16) of the lining-holder disc is 

increased. 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the radial lugs (671) are separated from the blades (672) 

by cane-shaped slots (24). 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the said support zone (622) has a height which is less than 

that of the said peripheral zones (422) and less than that of its 
connecting fold (621).  

 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the said support zone (944, 1125, 1427) is produced in the 

main portion of the said tongue by virtue of the cutout (46, 
1126, 1428). 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the said cutout defines a lug formed by the said 

supplementary support zone and by its fold joining it to the main 
portion of the tongue. 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the said tongue also exhibits at its free end, by means of 

a connecting fold (621), a support zone (622) which is offset 
axially in the direction of the support zone of the blades. 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the tongue (1072) has at its outer periphery two 

supplementary support zones (1121) joined to the main portion of 
the tongue (1072) by two folds (1121) which are oblique with 

respect to the radial axis of symmetry of the tongue. 
Lining-holder disc according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that friction linings are bonded to the radial blades and the 

tongues.
