<ABSTRACT>
A bipolar electrosurgical instrument (10) is 
provided having a handle assembly (12), an elongate body 

portion (18), and a tool mechanism (80). The body portion 
comprises an outer tubular member (20) and an inner rod 

member (22) coaxially slidable within the outer tubular 
member. Attached to a distal end of the body portion is 

the tool mechanism (80). The tool mechanism includes 
pivotally connected jaw members (82, 84) operatively 

connected to the inner rod member for movement by the 
handle assembly between open and closed positions. Each 

jaw member is fabricated from insulating material and is 
provided with a conductive pathway (62, 64). The 

conductive pathways are positioned to permit sparking 
between the pathways when the jaw members are open. As the 

jaw members are approximated, the insulating jaw member 
material blocks the electrical path between the conductive 

pathways to terminate electrical treatment of tissue 
positioned between the jaw members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bipolar electrosurgical 
instruments and, more particularly, to bipolar instruments 
for selectively grasping, manipulating, cutting and/or 
coagulating body tissue. Electrosurgery involves the cutting and/or 
coagulating of body tissue by application of high frequency 
electrical current. In bipolar electrosurgery, the 
electrical current is applied through an electrode which 
contacts the body tissue to be treated. A return electrode 
is placed in contact with or in close proximity to the 
current-supplying electrode such that an electrical circuit 
is formed between the two electrodes. In this manner, the 
applied electrical current is limited to the body tissue 
positioned between the electrodes. When the electrodes are 
sufficiently separated from one another, the electrical 
circuit is open and thus inadvertent contact of body tissue 
with either of the separated electrodes does not cause 
current to flow. To perform tissue cutting and/or coagulation, a 
high frequency power supply is connected to the bipolar 
instrument. Each electrode of the bipolar instrument is 
electrically isolated within the instrument and is 
separately connected to the high frequency power supply. 
Typical power supplies such as the SSE2L™ available from 
Valleylab, Inc. of Boulder, Colorado, are r.f. generators  
 
which can produce different electrical waveforms to effect 
various electrosurgical procedures. A waveform of continuous sinewaves alternating 
from positive to negative at the operating frequency of the 
r.f. generator is employed to cut tissue. Such a waveform 
creates short, intense electrical sparks to rapidly heat 
tissue; cells are exploded and the heat dissipated as 
steam. A waveform consisting of pulsating sine waves 
alternating from positive to negative at the operating 
frequency of the r.f. generator is employed to coagulate 
tissue. Such a waveform creates longer, less intense 
sparks which heat tissue less rapidly, allowing heat to be 
dissipated more widely than during cutting. A combination 
of the cutting and coagulating waveforms produces the 
capability to cut tissue with enhanced hemostasis over the 
pure cutting waveform. A fuller description concerning the electrical 
aspects of electrosurgery can be found in the Valleylab 
SSE2L™ Instruction Manual published by Valleylab of 
Boulder, Colorado, the disclosure of which is incorporated 
herein by reference. Electrosurgical procedures have, in recent years, 
become increasingly widespread. The ease and speed of
