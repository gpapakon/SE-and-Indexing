<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a thread wound golf ball having 
uniform flight performances, which causes little 

scattering of weight and inclusion of air into 
the liquid center, such that no separation of 

the paste occurs. The thread wound golf ball 
comprises a liquid center, a thread rubber layer 

and a cover. The liquid center comprises a 
paste and a center bag for coating the paste. 

The viscosity at 23°C (measured by a B type 
viscometer) of the paste is in the range of from 

15 to 70 poise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thread wound golf
ball. More particularly, it relates to a thread wound golf
ball having a paste-type liquid center.Thread wound golf balls are classified roughly into
two types; golf balls having a solid center (center
made of a rubber composition) and golf balls having a
liquid center.Regarding former thread wound golf balls having a
solid center, the amount of spin produced is too large, so that the
flight distance becomes short, thereby imparting hard
feeling (shot feel ). Therefore, professional golfers and
advanced players do not like golf balls with solid
centers.The latter liquid center is classified roughly into
two types; a liquid center containing paste in which a
filler is formulated to adjust the specific gravity and a liquid center
containing a liquid which is similar to water. When using
the liquid which is similar to water, a rubber center bag
for covering (containing) the liquid must have a certain degree
of a specific gravity so that the hardness of the center
bag becomes high, thereby imparting hard feeling in 
comparison with the liquid center containing paste. Furthermore, the
amount of spin becomes too large so that the flight
distance becomes short.To the contrary, regarding the liquid center
containing paste in which a filler is formulated to adjust
the specific gravity, the paste itself has a certain degree
of specific gravity so that the specific gravity of the
center bag can be decreased and the hardness can also be
decreased, thereby softening the center of the ball.Accordingly, the shot feel becomes soft and the amount of
spin does not become too large, which results in good
flight performances. Therefore, professional golfers and
advanced players like golf balls with a paste type
liquid center.However, regarding the liquid center containing paste,
scattering of quality (e.g scattering of weight, inclusion
of air, deviation of center of gravity in the liquid center
due to separation of paste into water and filler, etc.) is
liable to arise, which influences the flight performances of the ball.
The resulting flight performances are also liable to be
scattered.FR-A-816,243 relates to a thread wound golf ball having
a liquid center comprising a paste.It has been found that, by using a paste having a
viscosity in the range of from 15 
to 70 poise at 23°C (measured by a B type viscometer), a
liquid center which causes little scattering of weight and
inclusion of air into the liquid center, wherein no
separation of the paste arises can be
