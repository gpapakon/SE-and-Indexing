<ABSTRACT>
A thermal printhead (26) having a plurality of from a 
power supply (32). The current is directed to selected 

ones of a plurality of resistive heat elements (44-1...44-N) in 
response to a sequence of data bits corresponding to 

the image to be recorded. The number of selected 
resistive heat elements is determined by the current 

to the printhead (26) or by counting the number of data 
bits and a signal representative of the number of 

selected resistive heat elements (44-1...44-N) is produced. The 
duration of the application of current to the 

selected resistive heat elements is adjusted 
responsive to the sensed voltage across tresistive 

heat elements receives electrical current the selected 
print head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermal printers and 
more particularly to circuitry for supplying energy 
to thermal printhead resistive heat elements. As is well known in the art, a thermal printhead 
utilizes a row of closely spaced resistive heat 
generating elements which are selectively energized 
to record data in hard copy form. The data may 
comprise stored digital information related to text, 
bar codes, pictorial, or graphical images. In 
operation, the thermal printhead resistive heat 
elements receive energy from a power supply through 
driver circuits in response to the stored digital 
information. The heat from each energized element 
may be applied directly to thermal sensitive material 
or may be applied to a dye coated web to cause 
transfer of the dye by diffusion to paper or other 
receiver material. The heat developed in each resistive heat 
element is a function of a number of factors 
including the voltage applied to the element, the 
thermal state of the element and the thermal states 
of the surrounding elements. Often, the structure of 
the system is such that unwanted voltage drops occur 
between the power supply and the resistive heat 
elements. This "parasitic resistance" voltage drop 
varies as a function of the number of simultaneously 
energized resistive elements. If a large number of 
elements are energized, the effective voltage across 
the resistive heat elements decreases, and  
 
correspondingly, the optical density of the printed 
image decreases. Thus, the optical density of a 
single pixel becomes dependent on the number of heat 
elements energized and the corresponding system 
parasitic resistance. These density variations due to the system 
parasitic resistance produce significant image 
artifacts. Excessive loading of the power supply due 
to a large number of heat elements being 
simultaneously energized causes the effective voltage 
drop across the heat elements to fluctuate during the 
energizing period; creating an additional image 
artifact. Further, the power supply can not fully 
recover to the design voltage before the next energy 
pulse is asserted if the time period between the 
energy pulses is considerably short; as in the case 
of a fast line time printer. Many different techniques have been devised to 
control the factors which determine the print 
quality. U.S. Patent No. 4,736,089 (issued to Victor 
D. Hair on April 5, 1988) discloses a switching 
regulator for a thermal printhead in which the 
printhead temperature is sensed by a voltage 
generating
