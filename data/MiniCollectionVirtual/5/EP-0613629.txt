<ABSTRACT>
A case lock for preferably locking a cover element with a 
base element comprises a projection at the base element with 

two recesses in its surface. A locking housing (2a) is 
arranged at the cover element which has a connecting passage 

and two openings in which bars (3) are arranged so that they 
can be spring-shifted against each other. A guidance of the 

bars (3) slides in each opening passage and a bar base in 
each opening. A bar element (3b) extends downwards with a 

claw being undercut so that the bar element can be engaged 
behind one of the recesses of the base element. Each bar (3) 

comprises a button which is adjacent outwards and/or 
forwards to the guidance and which operatively protrudes in 

the most relaxed spring position over the locking housing 
(2a) to such an extent that the claw (3c) grips behind the 

recess of the base element. In the spring-tensed condition 
the bars (3) are shiftable inwards at least to such an 

extent that the claw (3c) is disengaged with the recess at 
the base element. The bars are spaced about 10 to 80 mm 

apart from each other at the front side of the case so that 
they can be easily pressed together with, e.g., the thumb 

and the index finger of one hand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a lock, e.g. for a make-up case or 
a jewel box comprising e.g. a base and a hinged cover 
arranged thereto. The lock comprises a base element arranged 
e.g. at the base and a cover element arranged e.g. at the 
cover. The width of the locking elements is preferably 
smaller than that of the case so that one can easily press 
inwards with e.g. the thumb and the index finger the sides 
of the two bars for unlocking the cover from the base. DE-OS 31 41 614 shows a cosmetic case with a container 
element and a cover element which can be hinged on the back 
of the container element. In the walls of the container 
element sliding elements are provided which can be pressed 
inwards from their sides thus releasing the cover element 
from the container element to swing it open. The problem 
hereby lies in the fact that particularly with larger cases, 
such as e.g. larger cosmetic or jewel cases, the operator 
has to spread out his/her fingers [to the outer edges of the 
case] in order to reciprocally shift the sliding elements 
inwards. This poses particular problems with cases which are 
at least as large as the span of a hand, as the operator has 
to either spread his/her fingers to an extreme extent or 
needs two hands for opening the case. For this purpose 
he/she would even have to put the case down. DE-OS 31 32 114 describes a make-up box with a container 
element and a cover coupled at the rear end of the container 
element. The cover can be swung down onto the container element 
thereby being locked at the front part with the container 
element by means of a locking device. For this purpose  
 
the operator has to press the front locking element 
backwards with his/her thumb exerting a counter-pressure on 
the joint connecting the container element and the cover. 
Thereby the same problem as explained above occurs, i.e., if 
the make-up box exceeds a certain size. Thereby, e.g. when 
pressing the locking device, a counter-pressure has to be 
exerted with the other hand on the joint. It is the object of the present invention to overcome the 
above-mentioned disadvantages and to provide a simply 
mounted lock. This object is achieved with a lock having the features of 
claim 1. The dependent claims are directed to preferred 
embodiments of the invention. The objects, advantages and features of the invention are 
illustrated in more detail in the following on the basis of 
examples and with reference to the drawings.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Lock, particularly for a make-up case or jewel box, which 
e.g. locks a cover with a base (1, 1') in the closed 

state, comprising: 

a) a base element, 
b) a cover element, 
c) a projection (1a; 1a') arranged at a base element and 
having two recesses (1b; 1b') in its surface and, 
d) a locking housing (2a; 2a') arranged at the cover 
element which has a connecting passage (2c; 2c') 

and two openings (2b; 2b') in which bars (3) are 
arranged so that they can be spring-shifted against 

each other, 
e) wherein a guidance (3a) of the bars (3) slides in each 
opening passage (2c; 2c') and a bar base (3d) of the 

bars (3) in each opening (2b; 2b'), 
f) each bar element (3b) of the bars (3) extending 
downwards with a claw (3c) being undercut can be 

engaged behind one of the recesses (1b; 1b') of the 
projection (1a; 1a'), 
g) each bar (3) comprises a button (3e) which is adjacent 
outwards and/or forwards to the guidance (3a) and 

which operatively protrudes in the most relaxed spring 
position over the locking housing (2a; 2a') to such an 

extent that the claw (3c) grips behind the recess (1b; 
1b') of the projection (1a; 1a') and which furthermore 

in the spring-tensed condition is shiftable inwards at 
least to such an extent that the claw (3c) is 

disengaged with the recess (1b; 1b'), and 
h) the bars are spaced about 10 to 80 mm apart from each 
other at the front side of the case so that they can 

be easily pressed together with, e.g. the thumb and 
the index finger of one hand. 
Lock according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
buttons (3e) of the bars (3) are spaced about 40 mm apart 

from each other. 
Lock according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bars each have a recess (3g) 

into which in the assembled state a part of the cover 
element or of the cover can be engaged, thereby preventing 

the bars (3) from being pushed out from the 
locking housing (2a). 
Lock according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at the interior of their bar element 

(3b) the bars (3) each comprise a slanted surface 
(3k) which interact with the inner portions of the 

recesses (1b; 1b') of the base (1; 1') in such a way 
that, if the bars (3) are pressed in, the cover element 

is automatically lifted. 
Lock according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at the outer end of the claw (3c) 

of the bar (3) a bevel (3h) and/or at the recesses (1b; 
1b') bevels are arranged in such a way that the bars (3) 

are automatically shifted inwards against the spring 
resistance when the cover element is lowered to the base 

element.
