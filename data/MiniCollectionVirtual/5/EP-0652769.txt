<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel metazoan parasite antigens, nucleic acids encoding them and their use in the control of disease caused by helminth and other metazoan parasites, particularly helminth and arthropod parasites in domestic animals. In particular the invention provides a protective metazoan parasite antigen or antigenic fragments, components or precursors thereof and functionally-equivalent derivatives, analogues or variants thereof having protective antigenic activity against one or more metazoan parasites, which antigen is characterised by being capable of binding to pepstatin, and which in native form is an integral membrane protein or protein complex. Also provided are antigens characterised by aspartyl proteinase-like and/or neutral endopeptidase-like activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel metazoan parasite 
antigens and their use in the control of disease caused 
by helminth and other metazoan parasites, particularly 
helminth and arthropod parasites in domestic animals. Each species of domestic animal can be parasitised by a 
number of different parasites, including many species of 
helminths and arthropods, a process which usually causes 
disease. Some of these diseases are of considerable 
economic importance: an example is haemonchosis which is 
caused by the helminth Haemonchus contortus, a nematode 
which parasitises the abomasum or true stomach of 
various ruminants including sheep. Juvenile and adult 
Haemonchus are blood suckers which attach by their 
mouthparts to small blood vessels within the gastric 
mucosa. Heavily parasitised sheep lose large amounts of 
blood leading to anaemia, ill-thrift and frequently 
death. Haemonchosis is more prevalent in tropical and 
subtropical parts of the world because the non-parasitic 
stages of H. contortus on the pasture are susceptible to 
low temperatures and often do not survive winter in 
temperate climates. Also of very considerable significance from an economic 
point of view are the non-blood feeding nematodes 
Ostertagia ostertagi and Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) 
circumcincta (O.circumcincta has recently been reclassified 
as T.circumcincta, although the new name is 
not yet in wide usage). Cattle and sheep infected with 
O.ostertagi and O.circumcincta respectively, fail to 
thrive and may die if untreated and Ostertagiosis 
represents one of the major helminth infections causing 
problems in animal husbandry today.  
 Other parasitic worms of economic importance include the 
various species of the following helminth families:-Trichostrongylus, Nematodirus, Dictyocaulus, Cooperia, 
Ascaris, Dirofilaria, Trichuris, Strongylus, Fasciola, 
Oesophagostomum, Bunostomum and Metastrongylus. In 
addition to domestic livestock, pets and humans may also 
be infected, not infrequently with fatal results and 
helminth infections and infestations thus pose a problem 
of considerable worldwide significance. Other metazoan parasites of significance include many 
arthropod species especially members of the arachnid and 
insect classes and in particular ectoparasites such as 
the blood-feeding (haematophagous) insects (eg. members 
of the insect divisions exopterygota and endopterygota), 
blowfly (Lucilia) and ticks. Particular mention may be made in this regard of ticks 
of the species Boophilus spp, Amblyomma spp,
