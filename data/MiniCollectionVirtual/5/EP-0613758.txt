<ABSTRACT>
A power tool has an application mechanism (300) 
for connection to the output of an epicyclic gearbox
 
provided with a torque control ring. The mechanism has a 

body (310) journalling a chuck spindle (302). Outside the 
body is a clutch control arrangement comprising balls 

(334,336) pressed against the torque control ring by 
individual springs (330) controlled by a control ring (322) 

threaded on the body. The mechanism includes a hammer 
arrangement having rotary and fixed ratchet plates (378,376) 

and cam ring (308) operable to engage and separate the 
plates by a lever (360) which projects between the springs 

(330).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power tools and 
particularly to an application mechanism for a power tool of 
the type comprising a housing, a motor mounted in said 
housing, a gearbox having an input end mounted on said motor 
and an output end adjacent an aperture in the housing, the 
gearbox being epicyclical and including a torque control 
ring which, when held stationery with respect to said 
housing, permits the gearbox to transmit torque and which, 
when permitted to rotate in the housing, disables torque 
transmission by the gearbox. In such power tools it is known to dispose an 
application mechanism on the output end of the gearbox, 
which mechanism comprises a resiliently biased, adjustable 
actuating means mounted on said body to selectively engage 
said torque control clutch ring. Adjustment of the actuating means varies the 
engagement with said torque control clutch ring thereby 
varying the torque at which it begins to slip and at which 
transmission by the gearbox to its output shaft is stopped. It is also known to lock the torque control ring 
so that it is not employed and so that no torque limitation 
is provided. In this instance, it is also known to dispose 
an application mechanism on the output end of the gearbox, 
which mechanism comprises a hammer arrangement whereby 
oscillating axial vibration can selectively be imposed on 
the rotary drive supplied by the gearbox. Finally, it is also known from DE 4038502 to 
provide an arrangement as first described above, i.e. a tool 
having a torque control mechanism mounted on the output end 
of the gearbox, but where a hammer mechanism is added on the 
front end of the torque control mechanism. Such an 
arrangement is versatile because it can be employed in 
various different ways. However, it suffers from being 
somewhat long having first a motor, then a gearbox, then a  
 
torque control mechanism, then a hammer mechanism, all one 
after the other. It is also known to employ electronic torque 
control whereby the torque applied is fed back to an 
electronic control module and, if the applied torque exceeds 
the torque preset in the control module, power is 
disconnected from the motor. Thus if a hammer mechanism is 
on the front of the gearbox there is no penalty in terms of 
compactness in providing both torque control and a hammer 
facility but, of course, the electronics do add cost and 
complexity. It is therefore, an object of the present 
invention to provide a power tool which has this versatility 
and yet remains compact but which

<CLAIMS>
A power tool comprising a housing (11), a motor 
mounted in said housing, a gearbox (10) having an input end (12) 

mounted on said motor and an output end adjacent an aperture 
in the housing, the gearbox being epicyclical and including a 

torque control ring (60) which, when held stationary with respect 
to said housing (11), permits the gearbox (10) to transmit torque and 

which, when permitted to rotate in the housing, disables 
torque transmission by the gearbox; and an application 

mechanism driven by said gearbox (10), which mechanism 
comprises:- 


a) a substantially cylindrical hollow body (310); 
b) a chuck drive spindle (302) journalled in said body and 
defining therebetween an annular space; 
c) means limiting axial movement of said spindle (302) in 
said body (310) towards said gearbox (10); 
d) a rotary ratchet plate (378) fixed on said spindle (302); 
e) a facing fixed ratchet plate (376) in said body (310); 
f) means (308) to engage said ratchet plates (378, 376) together such 
that on rotation of the spindle (302) a reciprocating action is 

imposed thereon, said means including a lever (360) projecting radially 
through a slot in said body (310); 
g) resiliently biased, adjustable actuating means (330, 334, 336) 
mounted on said body (310) to selectively engage said torque 

control clutch ring (60), said lever (360) projecting through said 
actuating means. 
A power tool as claimed in claim 1 in which 
said engaging means comprises a cam ring (308) against which said 

fixed ratchet plate (376) is pressed, said plate (376) and cam ring (308) 
having facing cams (309a, 309b) such that, in a first angular position of 

said cam ring (308) with respect to said plate (376) the plate is 
displaced by said ring towards said rotary ratchet plate (378) 

enabling engagement therebetween.  
 
A power tool as claimed in claim 2, in which said body (310) 
comprises an end cap (312) and in which said cam ring (308) is 

supported against said end cap. 
A power tool as claimed in claim 3, in which 
said end cap (312) and cam ring (308) include detent means whereby said 

cam ring is engaged in one of said first position and a 
second angular position in which said fixed plate (376) is permitted by 

said ring to be displaced away from said rotary ratchet 
plate (378) preventing engagement therebetween. 
A power tool as claimed in any of claims 2 
to 4, in which said fixed plate (376) is pressed towards said cam 

ring (308) by spring means (374) in the body (310). 
A power tool as claimed in any preceding 
claim, in which said actuating means comprises a plurality 

of elements (334, 336) disposed in bores (338) around said body (310) and pressed 
by a plurality of springs (330) spaced around the outside of the 

body (310), and said lever (360) projects between two of said springs (330). 
A power tool as claimed in claim 6, in which 

said springs (330) are carried by a carrier ring (386) disposed on the 
body, said ring being axially free and rotationally locked 

on said body (310), a control ring (324) being threaded on said body (310) and 
actuable to displace axially said carrier ring (386). 
A power tool as claimed in claim 7, in which 
said carrier ring (386) and control ring (324) have a series of mutually 

engaging detents (342, 344) about their respective circumference to 
locate the control ring (324) in discrete angular positions with 

respect to the carrier ring (386).  
 
A power tool as claimed in claim 6,7 or 8 in 
which said springs (330) and elements (334, 336) correspond in number and 

each spring (330) acts directly on each element. 
A power tool as claimed in any of claims 6
