<ABSTRACT>
An electric field sensor equipped with a sensor head (1), package (13) housing the head (1), and an antenna 
(14) attached to the package (13) and connected to the head (1). The head (1) is composed of a substrate (3) and an 

optical modulator (4) mounted on the substrate (3). The modulator (4) is provided with an input optical waveguide 
(5) formed on the substrate (3), two phase-shifting optical waveguides (6) branched from the waveguide (5) on the 

substrate (3) and having the refractive indexes variable depending upon the intensity of the applied electric field, an 
output waveguide (7) joined with the waveguides (6) on the substrate (3), and two modulating electrodes (8) formed 

on or in the vicinity of the waveguides (6). The antenna (14) has two rod antenna elements (17 and 18) which are 
extended in parallel with the waveguide (6) in the opposite directions from the central part of the package (13). It is 

possible to fix the antenna (14) to the side face (21) of the package (13) and constitute the antenna (14) of two antenna 
element film pieces (22 and 23) which are extended in parallel with the guides (6) in the opposite directions from the 

central part of the side face (21). The antenna element film pieces (17 and 18) can be fixed to the substrate (3). It is 
also possible to form a plurality of optical modulators on the substrate and connect the antennas, respectively, to the 

modulators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric field
sensor for measuring an electric field intensity of an
electromagnetic wave or the like.Fig. 1 shows a conventional electric field
sensor. The electric field sensor comprises a sensor
head 1 and an antenna 2 connected to the sensor head 1.
The sensor head 1 has a substrate 3 and an optical
modulator 4 attached to the substrate 3.The optical modulator 4 comprises an incident
optical waveguide 5 formed on the substrate 3, two
phase-shift optical waveguides 6 which are formed on the
substrate 3 to be branched from the incident optical
waveguide 5 and each of which has a variable refractive
index varying in response to an electric field intensity
applied thereto, an outgoing optical waveguide 7 formed
on the substrate 3 to join the phase-shift optical
waveguides 6, and two modulation electrodes 8 formed on
or in the vicinity of the phase-shift optical waveguides
6. The incident optical waveguide 5 is connected to an
incident optical fiber 9. The outgoing optical waveguide 
7 is connected to an outgoing optical fiber 10.The antenna 2 has two rod antenna elements 11.
The rod antenna elements 11 are connected through lead
wires 12 to the modulation electrodes 8, respectively.
The rod antenna elements 11 are arranged to face a
direction of an electric field, in other words, to be
perpendicular to the phase-shift optical waveguides 6.
The rod antenna elements 11 are fixed to a package which
is not illustrated in the figure.In the conventional electric field sensor, the
antenna elements face the direction of the electric field
during measurement. Accordingly, a draw-out portion of
the optical fiber faces a direction of measurement. This
possibly results in a damage of the optical fiber.In the conventional electric field sensor, the
antenna must be arranged in various directions during
measurement because of its strict directivity. From US-patent 5,210,407 an electric field sensor according to the
preamble of claim 1 is known having a pair of opposing
plates forming a capacitor type antenna arrangement.According to the known electric field sensor the two antenna
elements extend in the same direction to each other perpendicularly
to the direction of the phase shift optical waveguides.It is an object of this invention to provide an electric field
sensor capable of preventing a damage of an optical fiber.This object is solved by an electric field sensor having the
features of the independent claim 1. Preferred developments of the
invention are given in the dependent claims.
