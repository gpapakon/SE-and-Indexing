<ABSTRACT>
Novel polypeptides derived from human fibronectin, and fusion proteins containing those peptide sequences are described which define a receptor binding site on fibronectin that binds to the platelet receptor glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa expressed by cells. The receptor binding site of human fibronectin includes at least fibronectin amino acid residues 1410-1436. The polypeptides facilitate attachment of cells to substrates either alone or in conjunction with RGD-containing peptides. Vectors preparing the fusion proteins and antibodies are also described. Methods for promoting cell attachment and for inhibiting cell adhesion are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and
compositions for promoting cell attachment to
substrates. The invention particularly relates to the
use of newly identified binding sites of fibronectin
for binding to integrin receptors on cells.Regulation of cell adhesive events has broad
biomedical implications. For instance, inhibition of
cell adhesion may be of benefit in the treatment of
thrombotic disorders through inhibition of platelet
aggregation, of inflammatory disorders through
inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and
transmigration,and in malignant disease through
inhibition of tumor cell lodgement and metastasis.
Conversely, promotion of cell adhesion is, in some
cases, desirable. For example, in the seeding of
endothelial cells onto vascular grafts, in the
stability of medical prostheses, and in promotion of
wound healing. Adhesive events are widely recognized
to involve interactions of extracellular receptors,
i.e., integrin receptors, with substances surrounding
the cell, e.g., fibronectin. Integrins are a
functionally and structurally related group of
receptors that interact with a wide variety of ligands
including extracellular matrix glycoproteins,
complement and other cells. Integrins participate in
cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion in many 
physiologically important processes including
embryological development, hemostasis, thrombosis,
wound healing, immune and nonimmune defense mechanisms
and oncogenic transformation. See Hynes, Cell,
48:549-554 (1987). Several integrins that participate
in dynamic cell adhesion bind a tripeptide, arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid (RGD), present in their ligand.
See Ruoslahti et al., Science, 238:491-497 (1987).Fibronectin is an adhesive glycoprotein found in
plasma and on cell surfaces and extracellular
matrices. By binding other macromolecules as well as
cells, fibronectin promotes anchorage of cells to
substrata. Hynes, in Cell Biology of the
Extracellular Matrix, Hay ed., Plenum Press, pages
295-334 (1982); Hynes et al., J. Cell Biol., 95:369-77
(1982). Also, fibronectin is known to accumulate at
sites of injury and inflammation invivo [Petterson et
al., Clin. Immunol. Immunopath, 11:425-436 (1978);
Grinnel et al., J. Invest. Derm., 76:181-189 (1981);

(1985); Carsons et al., Arth. Rheum, 24(10):1261-67
(1981)] and is produced by cells in blood vessel walls
at these sites. Clark et al., J. Exp. Med., 156:646-51
