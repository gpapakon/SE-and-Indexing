<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum alloy structural member is crystalline. In 
producing this aluminum alloy structural member, a 

procedure is employed which includes forming a green 
compact by use of aluminum alloy having an amorphous phase, 

and subjecting the green compact to a powder forging 
technique. An aluminum alloy powder exhibiting an exotherm 

E smaller than 20 J/g at the time of the crystallization of 
the amorphous phases is used. By setting the exotherm E in 

such a range, cracking of the green compact due to a 
degassing can be avoided, even if the green compact is 

rapidly heated in a temperature-rising or heating course.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a structural member of aluminum alloy, and
particularly, to a process for producing a structural
member having a stable phase by forming a green compact
using an aluminum alloy powder having a metastable phase
and then subjecting the green compact to a powder forging
technique.There are conventionally known processes for producing
a structural member in which a quenched and solidified
aluminum alloy powder is used for the purpose of improving
the mechanical properties of the structural member, and a
powder forging technique is utilized (see Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No.74807/1992).The quenched and solidified aluminum alloy powder has
an Al2O3 film on the surface of each particle. This film
causes the bonding of particles to be obstructed, but
particles of the quenched and solidified aluminum alloy
powder are crystalline. Under application of a powder
forging technique, the main aluminum alloy portion under
the Al2O3 film is entirely thermally expanded to break the
Al2O3 film, thereby permitting the main aluminum alloy
portions to be bonded to one another. This avoids such
disadvantage due to the Al2O3 film. If an aluminum alloy having a metastable phase is
transformed in phase, the metallographic structure of the
crystalline aluminum alloy after the phase-transformation
is more fine and uniform than that of the quenched and
solidified aluminum alloy. Therefore, if this crystalline
aluminum alloy is applied to the production of a structural
member, it is possible to produce a structural member
having further improved mechanical properties.From such a viewpoint, an attempt has been made to
prepare aluminum alloy powder having a metastable phase,
for example, by a high pressure gas atomizing process and
to produce a structural member by utilizing a powder
forging technique.However, the phase-transformation of the metastable
phases is accompanied by an exothermic action and a
volumetric shrinkage. Therefore, when aluminum alloy powder
exhibiting an exotherm E equal to or more than 20 J/g is
used, when the green compact is rapidly heated in a
temperature-rising or heating course to start the phase-transformation
of the aluminum alloy powder particles in a
surface layer of the green compact, the phase-transformation
is further promoted by a large exotherm E
generated at the time of the phase-transformation, so that
it is spreaded to the internal aluminum alloy particles.
Thus, the phase-transformation is rapidly advanced in the
entire region
