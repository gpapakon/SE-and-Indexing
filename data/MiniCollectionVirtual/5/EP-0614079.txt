<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for 
directly monitoring the concentration of biocides in 
aqueous systems and more particularly to a direct 
spectrometric method for quantifying biocides which have 
an absorbance or emission spectrum in a wavelength range 
of from 200 to 2500 nm wherein the spectrum of the 
aqueous system containing the biocides is determined and 
chemometric algorithms are applied to the spectrum. Traditional water treatment analysis methods involve 
taking grab samples and performing independent analytical 
procedures for each component of interest. Typically 
these are time consuming and involve significant delay 
between taking samples, obtaining results and finally 
making program adjustments. Some recent on-line analysis 
techniques have been developed, but these techniques are 
either not specific to a particular analyte, they are 
limited to measuring single components or they require 
the use of addition of reagents to develop a color 
intensity which is proportional to the concentration of 
the analyte of interest. For example, on-line analyzers 
have been developed which are capable of monitoring 
oxidizing biocides, i.e., ORP - Oxidation Reduction 
Potential analyzers. However, these analyzers are not 
specific and will respond to the presence of any 
oxidizing compounds in the system. Colorimetric analysis 
are similarly deficient due to: 
1. Slow response time since most colorimetric 
reactions take several minutes to develop.  2. Colorimetric reactions are subject to 
interference from background contaminants and 
physical parameters. For example many  
 
colorimetric endpoints are sensitive to 
temperature and pH. 3. Maintenance requirements. Periodic reagent 
replacement and re-standardization. Another technique that has been used to monitor 
aqueous systems relies on the measurement of inert tracer 
components to indirectly monitor product levels. 
However, active biocides which are used to treat water 
treatment systems are not inert and are consumed or 
degraded under normal operating conditions within the 
aqueous systems. For this reason periodic sampling of 
the active biocidal agents must still be made to ensure 
system protection. Thus, there exists a need for a rapid, direct method 
of monitoring active biocide concentrations in aqueous 
systems. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a method for the simultaneous direct measurement of 
active concentrations of one or more biocides in an 
aqueous system and which does not require
