<ABSTRACT>
An integrated rectifier circuit has two input terminals (1, 2) to which an alternating voltage source (A) can be connected, two output terminals (3, 2) for supplying a rectified voltage, a series regulating transistor (M1) whose regulated current path is connected between an input terminal and an output terminal (3), and a control circuit for controlling the series regulating transistor (M1) having an inverter circuit (1NV; M2, M3) constituted by a series connection between a FET (M2) of a first conductivity type and a FET (M3) of a second conductivity type. The series connection between the FETs (M2, M3) is linked to both output terminals (3, 2) of the rectifier circuit, and the gates of both FETs (M2, M3) are linked to each other and to the input terminal (1) of the rectifier circuit to which the series regulating transistor (M1) is connected. The common node (K) of both FETs (M2, M3) is linked to the control electrode of the series regulating transistor (M1). The control circuit has a further FET (M4) whose drain-source section is parallel to the drain-source section of one of the series-connected FETs (M2, M3). The gate of said FET (M4) receives a voltage (Vreg) which allows the conducting state d.c. resistance of the series regulating transistor (M1) to be regulated. All transistors (M1, M2, M3, M4) of the rectifier circuit are designed as monolithic integrated circuits.
