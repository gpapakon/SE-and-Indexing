<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionIONIC DYE-BASED ELECTRORHEOLOGICAL MATERIALSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to fluid compositions that exhibit substantial changes in rheological properties when exposed to electric fields. More specifically, the present invention relates to an electrorheological material that utilizes an ionic dye or pigment as the active particle component.Background ArtElectrorheological materials are fluid compositions that exhibit substantial changes in rheological properties in the presence of an electric field. Electrorheological materials typically consist of (1) a carrier fluid, (2) a particle component, (3) an activator, and (4) a surfactant. The surfactant of the electrorheological material is utilized to disperse the particle component within the carrier fluid while the activator is utilized to impart electroactivity to the particle component. In the presence of an electric field, the particle component becomes organized so as to increase the apparent viscosity or flow resistance of the overall fluid. Therefore, by manipulating the electric field, one can selectively change the apparent viscosity or flow resistance of an electrorheological material to achieve desired results in various known devices and applications.Over the years, many different types of electrorheological materials have been developed that are based on numerous types of particle components. These previously developed electrorheological materials may be utilized in various devices, including dampers designed for controlling vibration of a system in either an on/off or continuously variable manner. In many instances, an electrorheological material can be selected in order to provide specific performance characteristics in the particular device or application selected. For example, in a device where it is necessary or desirable to see the inner workings of a device with the human eye, an optically 

 transparent electrorheological material will be selected such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,075,021 entitled "Optically Transparent Electrorheological Fluid."In certain other devices or applications where the electrorheological material is readily visible to an outside observer, it may be desirable to utilize an electrorheological material that has aesthetic shades of color. In fact, several electrorheological materials have been previously mentioned in the patent literature that utilize dyes or pigments as electrorheological materials. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,484,162 describes an electroviscous recording
