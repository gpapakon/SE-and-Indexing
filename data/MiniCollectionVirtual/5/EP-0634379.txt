<ABSTRACT>
A bonded element of superconductive oxide materials having a high current density and a method for manufacturing such 
an element. The bonded element is such that regularly oriented superconductive oxide materials are bonded through the same 

kind of superconductive phase having the same crystalline orientation as, but a peritectic temperature lower than that of the bonding 
materials. The bonding method is such that the crystalline orientations of the bonding superconductive oxide materials are 

adjusted on the bonding surface; a substance which is formed by the constituent elements of the superconductive oxide material 
having a peritectic temperature lower than that of the material is inserted as the solder or is caused to contact each of the bonding 

superconductive oxide materials on the bonding surface; these materials are heated at a temperature lower than the peritectic 
temperature of the bonding materials, but higher than the peritectic temperature of the solder; and these are gradually cooled so 

that the same kind of oxide superconductor is grown and oriented on the bonded surface. In this way, it is possible to obtain a 
bonded element of the superconductive oxide materials having a high critical current density without grain boundaries that may 

hinder the flow of the electric current. The element can be used as a material for magnets, magnetic shields, and current leads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a REBa2Cu3Ox-based
superconducting joined product having a high
critical current density and a process for producing
the same.REBa2Cu3Ox-based superconductors have a high
critical temperature exceeding the liquid nitrogen
temperature and hence can offer a great economical
benefit when they could be put to practical use. In
these superconductors, however, a crystal grain
boundary serves as a weak link, so that a high
superconducting current cannot be flowed across the
crystal grain boundary and, in particular, the
critical current density is remarkably lowered in a
magnetic field. For this reason, the practical use
of the REBa2Cu3Ox-based superconductors could have
not been realized in the field of heavy current.The production of a REBa2Cu3Ox-based superconducting
bulk material comprising large crystal grains having a
volume of not less than 50 cm3 has become possible (see
M. Morita. et al: Advances in superconductivity III,
Springer-Verlag, Tokyo, 1990, pp. 733-736) by the melt
process, which is a process for producing an oxide
superconducting material, including the QMG process
(quench and melt growth process) (see U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 07/735,105 or
JP-A-2-153,803). The melt
process basically comprises heating a starting material
for a REBa2Cu3Ox-based superconductor to a semi-melted
state wherein a RE2BaCuO5 phase is present together with
a liquid phase composed mainly of Ba, Cu and O; and 
gradually cooling the system from just above the
peritectic temperature to conduct crystal growth of the
REBa2Cu3Ox phase. Large grains prepared by this process
contain a small angle grain boundary having a crystal
misorientation of several degrees but no grain boundary
having a large angle which serves as a weak link. For
this reason, in this material, the critical current
density within the grains is as high as 10000 A/cm2 or
more at 77 K and 1 T, so that the material is considered
to be applicable as material for superconducting coils,
bulk magnets, magnetic shields and current leads.In order that the REBa2Cu3Ox-based superconducting
bulk material prepared by the melt process can be used as
these materials, it is necessary to increase the size,
area or length. Since, however, the melt process is
basically a technique for producing an oxide
superconductor having no grain boundary by gradual
cooling from the melted state, there is a limitation on
an increase in size. Further, the material produced by
the melt process cannot be subjected to working which
breaks crystal
