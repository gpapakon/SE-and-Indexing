<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a timepiece with analogue display having at least one mode of operation, time-related or time-unrelated, and able to provide an information item relating to the state of this mode and/or to the state of a programmed event linked therewith. This timepiece includes:   - at least two analogue display members constructed in the form of an hour hand (H) and a minute hand (MN), - electronic means of supervision (22) conformed in order to manage the mode of operation, and - means of displaying states capable of providing a user with at least one alphanumeric message informing him as to the state of the said mode and/or as to the state of the said event, this timepiece being characterised in that the means of displaying states consist of the hands (H,MN) themselves which, depending on their relative angular position determined on command by the electronic means of supervision (22), are able to act structurally on the said message in order to render it intelligible in the chosen angular position of the hands.

Analogue display timepiece having at least one
operation mode other than the normal hour display mode and

able to provide an information relating to the state of
said mode and/or to the state of a programmed event linked

to the latter, said timepiece also comprising:

at least two hands (H, MN) (and a minute hand
(MN) capable of being) activated independently by motor

means (18, 20),
electronic control means (22) formed to control
said operation mode, and
state display means capable of providing the user
of the timepiece with at least one alphanumerical message

informing him of the state of said mode and/or the state
of said event,

characterized in that the state display means include the
hands (H, MN) themselves which, as a function of their

relative angular position driven under the control of the
electronic control means (22), can act structurally upon

said message to make it intelligible in the selected
angular position of the hands,
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterized in
that said state display means are formed in such a way

that said message is made intelligible and perceptible
essentially when the hands (H, MN) are superposed.
Timepiece according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the two hands (H, MN) carry

respectively a part of the message which can only be
reconstituted in the selected angular position of the

hands, this position being driven under the control of the
electronic control means (22) as a function of the state

of said mode and/or said event.
Timepiece according to claim 3, characterized in
that said message is integrally and uniquely inscribed on

the hands (H, MN), partly on one and partly on the other, 
this message only being able to be reconstituted when said

hands are superposed.
Timepiece according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that said message is inscribed in part on

at least one of the hands and in part on a fixed element
of the timepiece.
Timepiece according to claim 3, characterized in
that said message is inscribed in part on said hands and

in part on a fixed element of the timepiece.
Timepiece according to claim 5 or 6,
characterized in t
hat the fixed element is formed by the
dial and/or the glass
Timepiece according to claim 5 or 6,
characterized in that said message is truncated

vertically, a lower part and/or an upper part of the
latter being carried by said fixed part, whilst its

complementary part is carried by the hand or hands.
Timepiece according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the longest hand (MN) is

mounted under the smallest hand (H).
Timepiece according to claims 9 and 1 or 2,
characterized in that the hands are formed in such a way

that, when they are superposed, the total visible surface
constituted by their superposition forms in this

configuration only a display surface (SR) capable of
reflecting light to make visible at least one message

carried above the hands, by a fixed element of the
timepiece.
Timepiece according to claim 10, characterized in
that the fixed element is the glass.
Timepiece according to claim 11, characterised in
that said glass carries a plurality of messages above

which the hands can be superposed, by the selective
control of the electronic control means (22).
Timepiece according to claim 12, characterized in
that the various messages are inscribed on the glass in 

different angular positions to those in which the hands
overlap during the standard display operation mode.
Timepiece according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the hands are an hour hand

(H) and a minute hand (MN).
