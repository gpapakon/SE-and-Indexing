<ABSTRACT>
This is an articulated assembly including two components in engagement with one another via at least one journal (20), with a return spring (22) permanently urging these two components into a relative direction of rest, one with respect to the other. According to the invention, the journal (20) is axially hollowed out and thus forms a housing (28) for the return spring (22), around the border of a notch (29) forming this journal (20) there is provided a lug (30) under which the corresponding leg (27) of the return spring (20) can be engaged and, in which with this notch (29) the component including the bowl with which the journal (20) interacts also includes a recess which intersects this bowl and in which this leg (27) of the return spring (22) may axially engage. Application in particular to electrical apparatus casings in which a flap is articulated to a cover for protecting the electrical apparatus in question, at rest.

A pivoted assembly comprising on the one hand two portions (13, 
14) of which one, the portion (14), referred to hereinafter as the male 

portion, comprises in projecting relationship at least one trunnion (20) 
by means of which it is pivotably engaged with a cup (21) provided in 

complementary manner in recessed relationship on the other, the portion 
(13), referred to hereinafter as the female portion, and, on the other 

hand, a return spring (22) which, operatively disposed between said 
portions (13, 14), permanently urges them in the direction of a given 

relative rest position with respect to each other, and comprises a 
central torsion and compression part (26) and two end limbs (27, 27') of 

which one at least, the limb (27), referred to hereinafter as the 
hooking limb, extends laterally, in which assembly the trunnion (20) of 

the male portion (14) is axially recessed and thus forms a housing (28) 
for said central part (26) of the return spring (22), in which at the 

side of a notch (29) which at least locally affects said trunnion (20) 

there is provided a lug (30) under which the hooking limb (27) of the 
return spring (22) can be engaged, and in which, corresponding to said 

notch (29), the female portion (13) itself comprises a recess (31) which 
intersects its cup (21) and into which said hooking limb (27) can be 

engaged. 
A pivoted assembly according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the lug (30) projects circularly on the edge of the notch (29) of the 

trunnion (20). 
A pivoted assembly according to either one of claims 1 and 2 
characterised in that the housing (28) for the return spring (22) is 

extended into the male portion (14) beyond the trunnion (20). 
A pivoted assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 3  
 

characterised in that the housing (28) for the return spring (22) is 
blind. 
A pivoted assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that, the other end limb (27') of the return spring 

(22) also extending laterally, the trunnion (20), for passage thereof, 
has a slot (33) which extends all along the corresponding housing (28). 
A pivoted assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that, at its connection to the cup (21), the recess 

(31) in the female portion (13) is circularly of a width (L2) which is 
at least equal to the diameter of the hooking limb (27) of the return 

spring (22). 
A pivoted assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that, to permit the return spring (22) to engage 

therein, the cup (21) of the female portion (13) is axially of a depth 
(P2) which is greater than the depth (P1) with which the trunnion (20) 

of the male portion (14) is engaged into same, and the recess (31) which 
intersects said cup (21) consequently extends axially. 
A pivoted assembly according to claim 7 characterised in that 
the cup (21) of the female portion (13) is axially stepped af two 

levels, namely, as from its mouth opening, a level of larger diameter 
(D1) for engagement of the trunnion (20) of the male portion (14), and a 

level of smaller diameter (D2) for engagement of the return spring (22). 
A pivoted assembly according to either one of claims 7 and 8 
characterised in that the part (36) of the cup (21) of the portion (13) 

corresponding to engagement of the return spring (22) is formed by ribs 
(38) which extend radially in a star configuration and which, at the 

same level, each transversely comprise a shoulder (39) for supporting 
the return spring (22).  

 
A pivoted assembly according to any one of claims 7 to 9 
characterised in that a shaft portion (40) extends axially in the cup 

(21) of the female portion (13) and, in the part (36) at least thereof 
corresponding to engagement of the return spring (22), its free end (41) 

at least is tapered. 
A pivoted assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 10 
characterised in that, for engagement thereof by simple latching into a 

cup (21, 21') in the female portion (13), a trunnion (20, 20') of the 
male portion (14) is overall provided laterally with a chamfer (35). 
A process for assembling a pivoted assembly according to any one 
of claims 1 to 11 characterised in that it comprises firstly engaging 

the return spring (22) into the housing (28) provided for same in the 
male portion (14), with its hooking limb (27) being hooked under the 

corresponding lug (30), so that the male portion (14) thus forms with 
the return spring (22) a unitary sub-assembly, the bringing the two 

portions (13, 14) into engagement with each other in their rest 
position, and finally moving said two portions (13, 14) away from each 

other. 
A housing for an item of electrical equipment comprising a 
casing body (12), a cover (13) which closes the casing body (12) and on 

which the item of electrical equipment (11) in question appears, and a 
flap (14) which is pivoted to the cover (13) for protecting the item of 

electrical equipment (11) in the rest condition, characterised in that 
the cover (13) and the flap (14) form with each other a pivoted assembly 

(18) according to any one of claims 1 to 11.
