<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a needle tip protective device (22). In one embodiment the needle tip protective device (22) includes a needle guard (41) that is slidably mounted on a hypodermic needle (10) having a needle tip (11) located at the distal end of the needle (10). The needle guard (41) contains a movable needle trap (41) that is biased against or toward the hypodermic needle (10). The needle trap (41) advances over the tip (11) of the needle, entrapping the needle tip (11) as the needle guard (41) is urged forward near the sharpened distal end of the hypodermic needle (10). A tether (24), or other limiting means, limits the forward movement of the needle guard (41) along the needle (10). In one embodiment, the needle guard is manually urged forward along the shaft of the needle by the user. In yet another embodiment, a spring, or other biasing means (19), is used to move the needle guard (41) along the shaft of the needle (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to needle tip guards for hypodermic
needles.The advent of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), combined with the
increasing incidence of other bloodborne pathogens such as Hepatitis B Virus
(HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), present healthcare workers with an
occupational hazard unprecedented in modem medicine. The risk of
contracting HIV from a needlestick injury is approximately 1 in 250, but for
those who contract HIV infection as a result of a needlestick injury the risk
becomes 1 in 1. The risk of contracting the more contagious HBV as a result
of a needlestick injury ranges from 1 in 6 to 1 in 30.There are also over twenty more known bloodbome pathogens which are
transmitted via blood and bodily fluids. The presence of any of these
pathogens in patients poses a risk to healthcare workers when invasive
procedures are performed. Infectious diseases are now the third leading
cause of death, behind heart disease and cancer, signifying a growing need
for safer hypodermic equipment. Ten years ago, infectious diseases were
classified as the fifth leading cause of death, they are now ranked third. This
increase of infectious disease is attributed mainly to the over-use of antibiotics
and the growing availability of re-usable, hollow-bore hypodermic equipment.As the population of infected individuals increases, more people will be
treated by healthcare workers, further increasing the odds of disease
transmission from patient to healthcare worker. Also, the use of disposable
hypodermic equipment is increasing at approximately 7% per annum. Additionally, a meaningful number of clusters of patient to patient transmission
in the healthcare setting has been identified throughout the world. Early data
suggests improper infection control techniques contribute directly to this
increase: including improper use of hypodermic equipment, multiple-dose
medicine vials; and failure to change protective gloves and gear for each new
patient.Recent studies also cite the discovery of significant blood contamination on
re-usable blood collection vacuum tube holders which are routinely used to
collect blood from different patients. Common practice is to ship one vacuum
tube holder with 100 blood collection needles. It is likely that new routes of
disease transmission will also be found in the future. Healthcare workers are
increasingly at risk to disease transmission and nurses perform the majority of
invasive hypodermic procedures, such as injecting medicine, collecting blood
and

A needle protective device (20) comprising:

a needle guard (22) slidably mounted on a needle (10) having a
proximal end and sharpened distal end (11), said needle (10) having at least

one change in profile (3) formed upon the length thereof, said guard (22)
having a proximal end and distal end, and is engageable with said change in profile (3) formed upon said needle (10) for limiting the distance said needle guard (22) slidably travels upon said needle (10), 
characterized in that
 said guard comprises a moveable
needle trap (41) that is biased toward the needle between a first retracted configuration

wherein said trap (41) is oriented against said needle (10) and a second
operative configuration wherein said needle trap (41) traps said sharpened

distal end (11) of said needle (10),
said needle
guard (22) being operative to engage with said change in profile (3)

substantially simultaneously when said needle trap (41) transitions from
said first retracted configuration to said second operative configuration.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said at least one
change in profile (3) comprises at least one recessed change in profile and

said needle guard (22) is engageable with said at least one recessed change
in profile.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) comprises at least one outwardly-bulging sidewall portion and that said

needle guard (22) is engageable with said at least one outwardly-bulging
sidewall portion.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) comprises a combination of at least one recessed change in profile and at

least one outwardly-bulging sidewall portion and that said needle guard (22) is 
engageable with said at least one recessed change in profile and said at least

one outwardly-bulging sidewall portion.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) comprises an elliptical abutment member having a first pair of opposed,

outwardly-extending sidewalls formed relative said needle for engaging with
said needle guard (22) and a second pair of opposed recessed sidewall

portions formed relative said needle.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) is integrally formed upon said needle (10).
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) comprises a crimp made upon said needle (10).
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein when said needle trap
(41) transitions from said first retracted configuration to said second operative

configuration, said needle guard (22) subsequently engages with said change
in profile (3).
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein when said needle
guard (22) is operative to engage with said change in profile (3), said needle

trap (41) subsequently transitions from first retracted configuration to said
second operative configuration.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) comprises at least one recessed change in profile and at least one

outwardly-bulging sidewall portion.
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said change in profile
(3) comprises a non-annular shape. 
The needle protective device of claim 2 wherein said at least one
recessed change in profile (3) comprises a flattened recess formed upon said

needle (10).
The needle protective device of claim 1 wherein said needle guard (22)
is engageable with a portion of said change in profile (3).
