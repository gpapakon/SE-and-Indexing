<ABSTRACT>
A receptacle capable of being stably positioned on the ground under the hind quarters of a dog to catch faeces therefrom. After use, the receptacle may be sealed and thrown away along with its contents. The disposable receptacle (1) consists of a cylindrical pot-shaped element made of synthetic material with a rigid or semi-rigid bottom wall (2), and a side wall (3) provided with wrinkled portions (4, 8) and forming a top opening (5). The wall (3) is compressed vertically in its storage position before use, then is partially stretched out in its faeces-receiving position. After use, the wall (3) is stretched to its full extent and knotted in order to seal the receptacle.
