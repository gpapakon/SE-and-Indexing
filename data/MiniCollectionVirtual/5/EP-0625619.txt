<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a scaffolding platform, in the case of which there are arranged at its two lateral ends, on the wall side, devices for fastening the platform on the wall and two outer supports which extend downwards from the plane of the platform and run on the wall of the structure. The invention consists in the fact that, between the supports (2) and at a distance beneath the horizontal plane defined by the fastening devices (7), provision is made for at least one device (19) for arranging a stop (20) which, in the operating position, projects at right angles with respect to the plane of the wall.

Scaffolding platform having devices facing the wall and 
arranged on both side ends for attaching the platform 

to the wall and two outer supports extending downwardly 
from the plane of the platform and travelling, in the 

working position, along the wall of the building, 
characterized in that at least one device (19) is 

provided between the supports (2) at a separation below 
the horizontal plane defined by the attachment devices 

(7) in the working position for arranging a stop (20) 
to produde, in a working position, at right angles from 

the plane of the wall. 
Platform according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the device (19) for the stop consists of an opening for 

a strut section. 
Platform according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the device (19) for the stop (20) consists of strut 

section which can be folded-out. 
Platform according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the strut section (20) is secured in its inoperative 

position and/or in its working position by means of a 
safety bolt (24). 
Platform according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a transverse girder (9, 10) is 

located between and connects the two outer supports (2) 
above in the vicinity of the attachment devices (7) for 

the platform and/or in the region of the stop (20).  
 
Platform according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the device (19) for the stop (20) is arranged on a 

transverse girder (10). 
Platform according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one additional platform 

attachment device (17), or at least a device for 
introducing such an attachment device (17), is provided 

for above the device for the stop (20) in the plane of 
the platform attachment device (7). 
Platform according to claim 7, characterized in that at 
least one girder section (11, 12) is provided for in 

the vicinity of the device (19) for the stop (20) which 
runs in an upward direction at least up to the plane 

defined by the attachment devices (7) for the platform. 
Platform according to claim 8, characterized in that 
two girder sections (11, 12) are provided for which 

extend from the device (19) for the stop (20) in the 
upward direction and the device (19) for the stop (20) 

is arranged between the girder sections (11, 12) on one 
of these connecting transverse girders (10). 
Platform according to claim 9, characterized in that at 
least one additional attachment device (17) is 

attachable to these girder sections (11, 12). 
Platform according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that an upper (9) and a lower (10) 

transverse girder as well as at least one girder 
section (11, 12) connecting the two transverse girders  

 
(9, 10) are rigidly connected to each other to form a 

separate structural member (19), wherein the stop (20) 
is or can be attached to the lower transverse girder 

(10) and at least one additional attachment device (17) 
for the platform can be introduced to the region of the 

upper transverse girder (9) and this separate 
structural member (19) can be attached to the outer 

supports (20) in an exchangeable fashion.
