<ABSTRACT>
The peripheral mandrels 1 are joined together and a filament winding produced around them and then cut, and the peripheral mandrels 1 are turned over and pressed around a central mandrel 16 on which another filament winding has been produced. Polymerization pressing gives the desired component. Application to the manufacture of missile bodies.

Process for the production of a composite material part 
constituted by a hollow central body (100) around which are 

assembled by an edge ailerons (101) oriented in divergent 
directions, involving a stage of winding a filament (26) 

around a central mandrel (16) having a shape similar to that 
of the cavity, characterized in that it also comprises the 

stages of: 

regrouping peripheral mandrels (1) in a number equal to 
the ailerons (101) and provided in each case with two mutual 

contact faces (4, 6), a fitting face to the central body (2) 
and two fitting faces to the ailerons (3, 7) which connect 

the fitting face to the central body (2) to respectively one 
of the mutual contact faces, in assemblies where the mutual 

contact faces are joined in pairs and where the fitting 
faces form for each assembly a continuous surface which is 

closed on itself, 
winding a filament (26) around the assemblies, 
cutting the windings around the assemblies where the 
mutual contact faces (20) are joined, 
separating the assemblies and pressing the peripheral 
mandrels on the central mandrel, the fitting faces to the 

central body (2) facing the central mandrel (16) and the 
fitting faces to the ailerons (3, 7) facing one another in 

pairs, 
and, in per se known manner, impregnation of the filament 
and polymerization of the impregnated material. 
Process for the production of a part according to claim 
1, characterized in that it comprises stages of winding a 

filament around at least one oblong mandrel (18), cutting 
the winding (9) in order to draw strips therefrom and 

interposing the strips (24) between the fitting faces to the 
ailerons (3, 7) when said faces face one another.  

 
Process for the production of a part according to either of the claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the filament is dry. 
Process for the production of a part according to either of the claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the filament is preimpregnated. 
Process for the production of a part according to any one of the claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that counter-forms (29) are fixed to the fitting 

faces to the central body (2) in order to constitute projections between the 
fitting faces to the ailerons (3, 7) when the filament is wound on the 

assemblies and then withdrawn when the peripheral mandrels are pressed onto 
the central body. 
Process for the production of a part according to any one of the claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the windings (10, 17, 17', 24) of the filament 

(10 and 24 or 10' and 24) are wound and polymerized separately and then 
assembled by bonding. 
Process for the production of a part according to any one of the claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the polymerization of the impregnation material 

of all the windings is produced simultaneously and during pressing, the 
winding around the central mandrel preceding the pressing operation. 
Process for the production of a part according to any one of the claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that there are four ailerons and, for each peripheral 

mandrel, the mutual contact faces and the fitting faces to the ailerons are 
located on a parallelepiped with a square section. 
Process for the production of a part according to any one of the claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that the peripheral mandrels (1) have a pressing face 

(5) connecting the mutual contact faces (4, 6). 
Production process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the part is a missile body.
