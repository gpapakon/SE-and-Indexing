<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a homeopathic compound having the general formula RxCH and one or a plurality of carriers, used for the fabrication of medicaments intended to the treatment of diseases caused by metabolic errors and to the treatment of viral diseases. In the general formula RxCH, x is one of the possible decimal or centesimal Hahnemanian or Korsakowian dilutions and R is the chemical substance responsible for the metabolic anomaly or is the viral particle which are the cause of the disease. The activity of R is to re-establish a normal function of the pericellular conveyor systems pertubated with respect to itself or to cause the elimination of particles outside the cell. The diseases concerned by the invention are, as a non-limitative indication, genetic, auto-immune and viral diseases, and intoxications.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a homeopathic product of the general 
formula RxCH, in which R is an active principle and in 

which xCH is its homeopathic dilution, especially 
hahnemannian or korsakowian homeopathic dilution, in said 

product, for the preparation of a drug intended for causing 
the elimination, from the cells which contain it, of a 

compound identical in nature to said active principle when 
the effect of this elimination is to restore normal 

function to the perturbed pericellular transport systems. 
Use according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the compound to be eliminated is a mineral compound and 

that the effect of its elimination is to restore normal 
function to an ion channel. 
Use according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the compound to be eliminated is a poison or part of a 

poison. 
Use according to claim 1 for the preparation of a 
drug intended for treating diseases caused by a metabolic 

error consisting either of an intracellular accumulation of 
a compound of simple or complex formula, or of an 

intracellular deficit of such a compound. 
Use according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the consequence of the metabolic error is the production of 

abnormal metabolites, especially abnormal antibodies such 
as autoantibodies. 
Use according to one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that the metabolic error is genetically 

determined.
