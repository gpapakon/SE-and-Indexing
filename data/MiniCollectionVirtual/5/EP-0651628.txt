<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a wound dressing (10) that is a porous, self-adhering elastic (14) bandage which may be compressively wrapped around a wound and which is capable of absorbing fluids and wound exudate. A preferred embodiment of the wound dressing (10) is a self-adhering elastic substrate (14) which does not adhere to clothing, hair or skin having a compressive force when extended that provides a therapeutic benefit and which is flexibly attached or fixed to an absorbent layer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a wound dressing and, 
more particularly, to a wound dressing that is a multilayer, self-adhering 
elastomeric bandage which may be compressively wrapped around a wound and 
is capable of absorbing fluids and wound exudate. A wide variety of materials have been used to treat or dress 
different types or kinds of wounds. Typical materials that are used in the 
various dressings include wound contact materials and absorbent materials as 
well as compressive materials which are used to hold the wound contact and 
absorbent materials in place and which provide compressive force to the wound. 
For example, chronic wounds such as venous stasis ulcers have commonly been 
treated or dressed by wrapping as many as four separate layers each of a 
different type of material around the leg. Specifically, a four layer bandage 
developed at Charing Cross Hospital, London, includes an inner exudate 
absorbent layer (VELBRAND wrap, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ), 
a crepe bandage, a compressive bandage (ELSET bandage, Seton) and an 
elastomeric wrap (COBAN self-adherent elastomeric bandage, 3M, St. Paul, 
MN). The use of multiple layers of different materials adds considerable time 
and expense both to the dressing itself and to the process of applying and 
changing the dressing. Elastic fabric wraps are often used as an outer layer of 
compression wound dressings in order to hold the inner layers in place and to 
apply compression to the wound. The use of fabric elastomeric wraps, 
however, is not always desirable because dressings wrapped with elastic fabrics 
are likely to slip or shift after being applied which may result in insufficient 
compression being applied to the wound by the dressing or which may cause 
discomfort to the patient. Attempts to overcome the problems of slipping or 
shifting include applying a hydrocolloid adhesive to one side of the fabric wrap. 
The hydrocolloid adhesive is intended to stick to skin in order to prevent 
slippage (a bandage of this type is commercially available and is sold as 
DUODERM adhesive compression bandage, ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ). 
Furthermore, many elastic fabrics do not have the capability of absorbing 
fluids.  
 In addition to the elastic fabric bandages referred to above, a 
variety of other wound dressings or bandage materials have been reported. A 
elastomeric self-adhering bandage is reported in U.S. Patents 3,575,782 to 
Hansen and 4,984,584 to Hansen et al. According to the disclosure of these 
patents,

<CLAIMS>
An elastic wound dressing comprising 

a) a porous, self-adhering substrate (14; 24; 30; 40) which does not adhere to 
clothing, hair or skin and which has a permanent compressive force when 

extended sufficient to hold the dressing in place for a period of time to provide 
a therapeutic effect to the wound, 
b) an absorbent layer (12; 20; 32; 42) covering at least a portion of the self-adhering 
substrate, and 
c) means (16; 22; 34; 44) to flexibly bond the self-adhering substrate to the 
absorbent layer. 
The dressing according to claim 1 wherein the self-adhering substrate (14; 24; 
30; 40) comprises partially extended, longitudinally aligned elastic yarns fixed between 

at least two porous fibrous webs. 
The dressing according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
self-adhering substrate (14; 24; 30; 40) comprises 

partially extended 
longitudinally aligned elastic yarns bound with a polymeric binder between 

at least two porous, nonwoven fibrous webs. 
The dressing according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the absorbent layer 
(12; 20; 32; 42) is a foam, 

woven or nonwoven material selected from the group consisting of rayon, 
polyester, polyurethane, polyolefin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, cotton, 

orlon, and hydrogel polymeric material. 
The dressing according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the absorbent layer 
(12; 20; 32; 42) is a 

composite material comprising a nonwoven polymeric matrix and a highly 
hydrophilic fluid absorbing material.  

 
A dressing according to any of claims 1 to 5 for 
use in a method of dressing a wound by wrapping the wound 

with the dressing.
