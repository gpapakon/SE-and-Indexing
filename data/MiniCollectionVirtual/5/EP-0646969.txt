<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to heterojunction 
semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to 
semiconductor devices comprising silicon and carbon doped 
silicon. Semiconductor heterojunction devices comprising at 
least two Group IV elements, silicon, germanium, and carbon, 
have been widely reported. In particular applications, 
heterojunction devices using Group IV elements are preferable 
over heterojunction devices using Group III and Group V 
elements for example, because heterojunction devices 
comprised of Group IV elements are more cost effective. Designers have typically added carbon to silicon to 
produce widened bandgap devices compared to silicon. The 
bandgap width is modified by varying the concentration of 
carbon in the silicon material. For example, carbon has been 
added to silicon to form widened bandgap emitter regions in 
HBT devices. Silicon carbide is a widely used form of heavily 
carbon doped (>40% carbon) silicon and has a bandgap of 2.2eV 
to 3.3eV compared to silicon's bandgap of 1.12eV at 25°C. Designers also have used germanium-carbon doped silicon 
for widened bandgap emitter regions in HBT devices. 
Germanium-carbon doped silicon devices have a disadvantage in 
that a manufacturer must control the concentrations of two 
elements, germanium and carbon, in order to provide a quality 
semiconductor layer. To provide a narrowed bandgap compared to silicon, 
designers typically add germanium to silicon. However, 
germanium doped silicon layers have several disadvantages. 
For example, in order for a sufficient bandgap narrowing to  
 
occur, relatively high concentrations, typically greater than 8% 
germanium, must be used. Since high concentrations of 
germanium are necessary to achieve bandgap narrowing, 
germanium doped silicon devices are susceptible to crystalline 
defects such as misfit dislocations. These crystalline defects 
severely limit the ability to produce narrowed bandgap devices. Furthermore, the processes used to manufacture 
germanium doped silicon layers are costly. Chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) techniques, such as molecular beam epitaxial 
deposition or conventional epitaxial deposition, typically are 
used to form the germanium doped silicon layers. These CVD 
techniques require significant capital investment and offer 
poor processing throughput. Also, using CVD techniques to 
selectively deposit germanium-doped silicon layers requires 
significant pre-deposition processing that adds to 
manufacturing costs. This increase in manufacturing
