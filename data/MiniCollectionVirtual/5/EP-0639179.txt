23-Oxa derivatives in the vitamin D series of 
formula I 


 
wherein 


R¹, R² and R⁴,
each independently of the others, represent 
a hydrogen atom or an acyl group having 

from 1 to 9 carbon atoms, 
each R³
represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or 
branched alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon 

atoms, and X represents an alkylene radical 
-(CH₂)
n
- wherein n is 1, 2 or 3 
with the proviso that if n is 1, each R³ may not 

be a methyl or propyl group, the latter in 
conjunction with R¹, R² and R⁴ each representing 

a C₁-C₉-acyl group. 
24-(1-Ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-23-oxa-9,10-seco-5(Z),7(E),10(19)-cholatriene-1α,3β-diol, 
24-(1-hydroxy-1-propylbutyl)-23-oxa-9,10-seco-5(Z),7(E),10(19)-cholatriene-1α,3β-diol,  

 
24-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-23-oxa-9,10-seco-5(Z),7(E),10(19)-cholatriene-1α,3β-diol, 

and 
24-(3-ethyl-3-hydroxypentyl)-23-oxa-9,10-seco-5(Z),7(E),10(19)-cholatriene-1α,3β-diol. 
Process for the preparation of compounds of the 
general formula I' 


 
wherein 


R¹, R² and R⁴,
each independently of the others, represent 
a hydrogen atom or an acyl group having from 

1 to 9 carbon atoms, 
each R³
represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or 
branched alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon 

atoms and X represents an alkylene radical 
-(CH₂)
n
- wherein n = 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that a compound of the general formula II 
 
wherein Y represents alkyl- or aryl-substituted 

silyl groups, is etherified with a compound of 
the general formula III 


 
wherein L represents a leaving group Br, I or
 
    

CH₃-C₆H₄SO₂O-,
 
   X represents an alkylene radical -(CH₂)
n
- wherein
 
   n = 1, 2 or 3,
 
   R represents a straight-chained or branched alkyl 

radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and
 
   R¹⁰ and R¹¹ likewise each represent a radical OR 

or
 
   R¹⁰ and R¹¹ together represent an oxygen atom, 

yielding a compound of the general formula IV  
 


 
to the carbonyl group of which is added a nucleophilic 

reagent of the general formula V 

R 
3
-Z
 
wherein R³ represents a linear or branched alkyl group 

having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and Z represents MgHal 
(Hal = Cl, Br, I) or an alkali metal atom (Li, Na, K), 

or if each R³ is to be a hydrogen atom, the carbonyl 
group is reacted with a complex hydride, such as, for 

example, lithium aluminium hydride, to form a compound of 
llthe general formula VI 


  
 

and that compound is converted by photochemical isomerisation 
of the triene system in the presence of a triplet 

sensitiser into a compound of the general formula VII 

 
and
 
the silyl protecting groups are removed and then, 

optionally, the free hydroxy groups are partially or 
completely esterified with a carboxylic acid chloride or 

anhydride that has from 1 to 9 carbon atoms in the acyl 
radical. 
Pharmaceutical preparations that comprise at least one 
compound of the general formula I and a pharmaceutically 

acceptable carrier. 
Use of the compounds of the general formula I for the 
preparation of medicaments.
