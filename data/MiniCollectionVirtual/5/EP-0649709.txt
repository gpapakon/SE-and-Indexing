<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for moving a robot safely 
and effectively according to the surrounding environment. Data relating 

to the surrounding environment is obtained from a plurality of different 
sensors. Sonar data given as distance information for an object is used 

to interpret the surface configuration of an object at a sonar 
interpretation section. Three-dimensional information comprising stereo 

data based on image signals from stereo cameras is used to interpret the 
surface configuration of an object at the stereo interpretation section. 

At the hypothesis generation section, a geometrically consistent 
interpretation is used taken from interpretations obtained from each 

sensor to generate a hypothesis giving the configuration of an object. A 
table is used to determine which data is assigned priority, sonar or 

stereo, to check sensor data corresponding to the surface configuration 
of the hypothesis against actual sensor data with the passage of time to 

verify the hypothesis. The mobile robot moves to avoid an obstacle, or 
its movement is directed, in accordance with the hypothesis with respect 

to the current environment by referencing the run route.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for moving a robot and, 
more particularly, to a device for moving a robot based on the 
surrounding environment. Mobile robots are used in manufacturing plants to transport loads. 
Many such mobile robots either move along a given run guide such as a 
rail or provide a detector (herein referred to as an inside angle sensor) 
for detecting the run distance in accordance with a route stored in the 
mobile robot in advance to enable it to move based on detected values. 
Some mobile robots have detectors such as ultrasonic wave sensors to 
avoid obstacles present in the direction of movement of the mobile robot 
or to detect the status of surroundings by using a bumper (fender) to 
detect the obstacle based on data (herein referred to as sensor data) on 
detected values used to avoid obstacles. In addition, also recently available are independent mobile robots 
that move within a free range. These independent robots must be able to 
recognize the surrounding environment to enable them to operate safely 
and efficiently. Consequently, different types of sensor must be 
provided to detect a plurality of different states to enable mobile 
robots to move and run safely and efficiently. Such different sensors have features that differ with the sensor. 
Consequently, it is possible that sensors obtaining sensor data in the 
same measurement unit with respect to the same object may generate 
contradictions in the configuration of a scene interpreted from sensor 
data. The configuration of a scene referred to herein means an 
environment established in the structure, including artificial objects 
and natural objects that can be detected by independent mobile robots. For example, in an attempt of obtaining distance information with 
respect to an object with different sensors such as ultrasonic wave 
sensors and cameras, ultrasonic wave sensors cannot provide accurate 
information with respect to a surface which is angled relative to the 
radiative direction of the ultrasonic wave or at an angle involving a 
curved surface. The stereo cameras can obtain distance information on 
such a surface configuration. Distance information differs with the type 
of sensor.  An algorithm is available which evaluates the reliability of 
environment data obtained from sensors by statistical analysis that 
avoids such contradictions. (A. Elfes, "Sonar-Based Real-World Mapping

<CLAIMS>
A device for controlling a mobile robot consisting of: 
a plurality of sensors (12, 14) of different kinds including at 

least a sensor which detects the presence of an object and at least 
a sensor 
which detects image information related to said object; 
an interpretation means (28, 30) for interpreting, for each of said 

sensors, elements of said object based on respective sensor data 
obtained from said plurality of sensors; 

a hypothesis generation means (32) to generate a hypothesis 
expressing a configuration of said object based on said elements of 

said object interpreted for each of said sensors by referencing a 
table in which interpretations of said respective sensors with 

respect to predetermined configurations of objects are stored in 
advance; and 

a movement means for moving a mobile robot by using the generated 
hypothesis. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: 
means for verifying said hypothesis generated obtained with the 

passage of time, and using said verified hypothesis when said 
hypothesis is correct and discarding said hypothesis when said 

hypothesis is contradictory; and 
a movement means for moving a mobile robot by using said 

hypothesis. 
A device as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2 wherein said 
hypothesis generation means classifies said configurations of 

objects stored in advance by figure of its surface, and said table 
stores all combinations of interpretations to be generated for each 

of said sensors for each said classified surface figure.
