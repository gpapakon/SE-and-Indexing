<DESCRIPTION>
 IDENTIFICATION APPARATUS Field of Invention:The present invention relates to acoustic and electronic identification apparatus. Specifically, the present invention relates to improvements in an identification apparatus, such as a transponder. Related ApplicationThe present invention, in part, relates to an improvement in identification apparatus, particularly the transponder apparatus the subject of US Patent No. 5153583, owned by the present applicant. The subject matter of US 5153583 is incorporated herein by reference. Prior Art:Prior art transponders known to the inventors derive their power from an internal battery (active transponders) or externally from the interrogator (passive transponders). Passive transponders are generally powered inductively as shown in US 3,964,024 Hutton et al, AU-B-45334/84 Hook et al and GB 2163324 A Buttemer, capacitively as shown in US 4,364,043 Cole et al and by electromagnetic radiation as per US 4,040,053.Transponders which utilise inductive or capacitive powering suffer from several disadvantages. The magnetic or electric fields must be limited in intensity for occupational health reasons. These limitations are often set by law. This may reduce operational range or necessitate special shielding. Field strength must be below the statutory radiation limits and may be interfered with by signals from other or proximate electrical equipment. Also, highly directive interrogation beams necessary for interrogating transponders at relatively long ranges pose a health hazard due to their concentrated energy density.Some forms of acoustic transponders are known, such as those disclosed in US 3293595 and US 3755803. These acoustic transponders, however, are limited in their communication abilities. This reduces the ability of these acoustic transponders to be used effectively as a means of identification. Other types of identification apparatus are "active". However these active identification apparatuses are also relatively limited in their ability to communicate with an external interrogator, due to limitations on their ability to 

receive and transmit signals simultaneously. This relatively limited communication ability can be linked to another problem associated with known identification apparatus which is attached to an article and which is moving past an interrogating point. There is only a relatively limited time in which communication can occur between the apparatus and interrogator. This limited time does have an effect on the speed and number of identification
