<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure responsive governor device (1) for gov­
erning the operation of a compressor or a compressor 

unloader has a spring-biassed valve device (13,14) controlling 
connection of an output port (3) to an input port (2) or to 

atmosphere according to the valve of a controlling reservoir 
pressure at the input port, the valve arrangement being posi­

tively held in the former condition by virtue of enhanced area 
exposed to the controlling pressure and the valve arrange­

ment being provided by a seal (13) which is sealingly slideable 
in a tubular opening (14) so as to be able to execute movement 

due to predetermining pressure changes without resulting in 
switching over to the other condition.

<DESCRIPTION>

 This invention relates to fluid pressure responsive governor devices and relates especially to such governor devices for controlling the unloading of air compressors such as may be employed for maintaining reservoirs of a fluid pressure vehicle braking system in a charged condition.


 Fluid pressure responsive governor devices have already been proposed which include a valve arrangement which up to a predetermined pressure maintain closed a fluid pressure passage between a pressure input port and a pressure output port and at the same time provide a vent path for the output port so that no pressure signal appears thereat under these conditions. On attainment of the predetermined pressure, however, the valve arrangement unseats to present an increased area to the pressure at the input port thereby effecting a snap. action accompanied.by opening of the communication between the input and output port and closure of the vent path.


 Such valves as have hitherto been proposed have suffered certain shortcomings in that in order to provide stability of operation, the governor has had to be designed such that the predetermined pressure is appreciably higher than the pressure at which the governor returns to its starting condition.


 According to the present invention, a fluid pressure responsive governor device is proposed which includes a body having a fluid pressure input signal port and a fluid pressure output signal port, spring-loaded valve means resPonsive to attainment of a predetermined   pressure    at the input port to move to a condition in which it opens a connection between the input port and the output   20      a P      closes    an output port vent valve,
 said member   thereafter    being positively hold in said condition by   virtue    of an   inc-.ate    of   efiestivee    area  exposed to said input port pressure characterised in that means are provided whereby the spring-loaded means is able to   execUte'Covement    due to a pressure change whilst nevertheless maintaining closure of the vent valve.


Preferably the said means is provided by said valve having a tubular seat part and a closure part which is such as to effect a plugging action in the aperture of said tubular part.


By virtue of the invention it is found that a governor device can be provided which, whilst remaining stable, enables a reduced pressure differential between tee said predetermined pressure and the lower pressure at which the device subsequently resets.


In order that the present invention may be more

<CLAIMS>
Claims:



   1.    A fluid pressure responsive governor device including a body (1, 21) having a fluid pressure input signal port (2, 22) and a fluid pressure output signal port (3, 23), spring loaded valve means (11, 15; 29, 34) responsive to attainment of a predetermined pressure at the input port to move to a condition in which it opens a connection between the input port and the output port and closes an output port vent valve, said member thereafter being positively held in said condition by virtue of an increase of effective area exposed to said input port pressure,
 characterised in that means (13, 14;) are provided whereby the spring loaded means is able to execute movement due to a pressure change whilst nevertheless maintaining closure of the vent valve.


 

2. A fluid pressure responsive governor device as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that said means is provided by said valve having a tubular seat part and a closure part (13;48) which is such as to effect a plugging action in the aperture (14;49) of said tubular part.



3. A fluid pressure responsive governor device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised in that adjustable means (5;25) are included adjustment of which can determine the differential between the pressure to set and the pressure to reset the device.  



4. A fluid pressure responsive governor device as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the adjustment determines the distance which the closure part is movable within the seat part whilst in seating engagement therewith.
