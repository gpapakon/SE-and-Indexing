<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic transducer apparatus comprises a 
piezoelectric resonator stack which contains active 

piezoelectric layers (20,20B,20C,20D,20E,20F), internal 
conductive electrodes (22A,22B,22C,22D,22E,22F), 

internal bonding layers (25A,25B,25C,25D), and an 
optional internal dielectric layer (24A,24B). The 

electrodes may be connected to provide alternating 
polarization directions, or any other desired sequence 

of polarization directions, in the sequence of 
piezoelectric layers. An optional edge dielectric 

layer (21A,21B,21C,21D,21E,21F), positioned between 
side electrodes (23A,23B) and adjacent piezoelectric 

layers, controls the fringe electrical fields and the 
lateral piezoelectric modes that would otherwise 

develop. The piezoelectric layers may have uniform 
thicknesses with independently selected polarization 

direction within each piezoelectric layer. 
Alternatively, the individual piezoelectric layers may 
have non-uniform thicknesses tn and independently 

selected polarization direction within each layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acoustic transducers for medical imaging 
using multilayer piezoelectric materials, and to improvements in acoustic 
signal definition and bandwidth. A diagnostic ultrasonic imaging system forms images of tissues 
inside the human body by electrically exciting a transducer or array of 
transducers to generate short ultrasonic pulses, which then travel into the 
body. A transducer or array of transducers then converts the ultrasonic 
echoes from the tissues into electrical signals which are amplified and used 
to form a cross sectional image of the tissue. Most often, transducers used 
for medical imaging consist of a single layer of piezoelectric material that 
requires excitation with a high voltage for generating short ultrasonic 
pulses. The echo signals are often amplified with low voltage integrated 
circuit electronics. Currently, the high excitation voltage is an impediment to 
integrating low voltage, high density circuitry with a transducer or an 
array of transducers. For example, a two-dimensional acoustic array with 
a large number of acoustic elements requires local integrated electronics 
to achieve acceptable performance. It is both desirable and beneficial to 
strive for use of a low voltage transducer that can be excited by standard 
low voltage integrated circuit electronics. Use of low voltage transducers 
also reduces the potential of electrical hazard to the patient. From an electrical point of view, achieving the required electric 
field within the piezoelectric material at low applied voltage requires a 
relatively thin layer of piezoelectric material. Achieving the desired 
operating frequency of the resonator requires a thickness of one half 
wavelength (or odd integer multiples thereof) or a thickness of one 
quarter wavelength (or odd integer multiples thereof). In addition, a 
uniform poling field throughout the lateral extent of the piezoelectric 
resonator and a uniform electric field without fringing fields during  
 
operation is required. In the prior art, these requirements have not been 
anticipated in the embodiments nor in the teachings. Berlincourt, et al. disclose use of two or more piezoelectric layers 
in a stack on a substrate, with an independent common electrode being 
positioned between any two adjacent piezoelectric layers, in U.S. Patent 
No. 3,590,287. The objective is to provide improved filters and 
transformers for signal processing applications. Two adjacent 
piezoelectric layers are chosen to have the same or opposite
