<ABSTRACT>
A wraparound polymer-laminated fabric sleeve (2) that is heat-recoverable at least in part is provided with electrical heating means (8, 10, 12) along one longitudinal edge and both annular ends of the wrapped sleeve. Electrical current is passed through the heating means (8, 10, 12) to recover at least part of the sleeve and to bond it to an underlying substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
DescriptionArticle and Method for bonding to an elongate objectThis invention relates to a heat recoverable wraparound article for bonding to an object such as a pipe, eg to seal against ingress of water, to protect against physical damage or to make a joint between the object and another object. In particular, the invention relates to a wraparound article including heating means along at least one longitudinal edge and along the circumferential edges as considered in the wrapped configuration.A wraparound article including heating means along three edges is known from DE-A-3712356. This describes a sheet of thermoplastic material for covering a joint between plastic pipes in which the sheet is provided with at least two parallel heating wires on three edge regions. The article is not heat recoverable.A heat-recoverable article is one whose dimensional configuration can be made to change substantially when subjected to heat treatment. A heat-recoverable article will usually recover towards an original shape from which it has previously been deformed but the term as used herein also includes articles which adopt a new configuration when subjected to heat treatment, even if it has not previously been deformed.Heat-recoverable articles are well known and may be used in the sealing of pipe joints, the repair of polymeric coatings on pipes and similar structures, the protection from chemical and physical attack of pipes and other structures, often metallic. They may also be used to seal cable splices.When a joint is made between two lengths of thermally insulated steel pipe, as used for example in a district heating system, the insulation is removed (typically in the factory) from the end 

 regions of each length of pipe in order that the insulation is not burnt when the pipes are joined, for example by welding. After the weld has been completed, the uninsulated portion of the pipe in the region of the joint must be reinsulated in order to rninimise heat loss. It is important that the insulation in the region of the joint is sealed against moisture ingress which might otherwise cause degradation of the insulation, not only in the joint region but possibly also along the pipes to some distance from the joint, and cause also corrosion of the pipes.Severe physical constraints are placed upon the seal of the insulation at a joint between insulated pipes in a district heating system. As a result of frequent and wide temperature cycling, the pipe can be subjected to expansion and contraction cycles and to

Claims
1. A wraparound article for bonding to an elongate object such as a pipe or cable or for making, or bonding to, a joint or splice between such articles, the article comprising a layer of a fabric that is heat-recoverable at least in part, which is in the form of a sheet that can be wrapped around the object, and which is provided with electrical heating means in and/or on its inner surface when wrapped, along at least three edges of the sheet, being at least one of the longitudinal edges and both annular edges when the sheet is in its wrapped configuration.
2. An article according to claim 1, wherein at least one of the heating means is at least partially embedded in the surface of the sheet.
3. An article according to claim 1, wherein at least one of the heating means lies on the surface of the fabric layer.
4. An article according to any preceding claim, wherein at least one of the heating means comprises conductive wire or fibres forming part of, or inserted into the interstices of the fabric.
5. An article according to any preceding claim, having a wall thickness in the range 2 to 15mm.
6. An article according to any preceding claim which is heat recoverable only in part.
7. An article according to claim 6, wherein a central tubular region of the sleeve, when in its wrapped configuration is not heat-recoverable. 


 8. A method of covering an elongate object or bonding two such objects in end to end relationship using a wraparound article according to any preceding claim, the method comprising connecting the heating means to a power supply to heat and to recover those regions into contact with the underlying object.
9. A method according to claim 8, in which the article is wrapped around the object so that longitudinal edges overlap and electrical power applied initially to the electrical heating means on the at least one longitudinal edge to bond the edges to each other.
10. A method according to claim 9. for joining two pipes or cables, or for covering a joint between two pipes, or cables wherein the article is wrapped around a piece of release paper, preferably on one object to one side of the joint before heat is applied to the heating means on the longitudinal edge.
11. A method according to claims 9 or 10, wherein electrical power is then supplied to the annular heating means at each end of the wrapped article.
12. A method according to claim 11, when dependent on claim 10, wherein the article is pushed over the joint before the electrical power is supplied to the annular heating means.
13. A method according to any of claims 10 to 12, wherein the objects are pipes or cables or joints therebetween, preferably district heating pipes or a joint therebetween.
14. A method according to any of claims 10 to 13, wherein the thermal mass of the article is less than the thermal mass of that part of the pipe which is heated by the heating means. 


15. An method according to any preceding claim, wherein the wall thickness of the article is less than the wall thickness of the pipe, preferably less than 0.75 times the thickness of the pipe.
16. An article or method according to any preceding claim, which is at least partially heat shrinkable, preferably radially heat shrinkable when the article is in its wrapped configuration.
17. A method of reinsulating a bared joint between district heating pipes each of which comprises a central pipe having an outer insulation, the method comprising
( 1 ) positioning a wraparound article either to bridge the insulation on either side of the pipes or to bridge from a pipe to a central casing positioned over the joint the article comprising a wraparound fabric sleeve which has end annular regions which are radially heat shrinkable, and a central tubular portion which is radially heat stable, and
(2) applying heat to shrink the ends of the article,
whereby after shrinkage the sleeve is longitudinally flexible.
