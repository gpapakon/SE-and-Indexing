Method of manufacturing a bit line contact hole
of a memory cell in a semiconductor substrate (1)

having a capacitor (7, 8, 9) which is arranged above a
MOS transistor (3, 4, 5),


a bit line (15) which is arranged above the
capacitor, and a lower capacitor plate (7) which is

connected to a first source/drain region (3) of the
transistor, the semiconductor substrate containing a

plurality of memory cells, in which method

the distance between the lower capacitor plates
(7) of adjacent memory cells is manufactured so as

to be greater over a second source/drain region
(4) of the transistor with which contact is to be

made than over the rest of the semiconductor
substrate (1),
a conductive layer (9) which serves as cell plate
is applied over the capacitor plates to such a

thickness that the narrow distance between the
capacitor plates is essentially filled in and a

depression (10) is produced in the wide gap so
that, after the conductive layer (9) is applied,

the surface has depressions (10) over the second
source/drain region (4) and raised points over the

other areas of the memory cell,
an auxiliary structure (11') is produced in the
depression, self-aligned with respect to the

depression,
a mask (12) is produced on the surface of the
conductive layer (9) not covered by the auxiliary 

structure, self-aligned with respect to the
auxiliary structure,
the bit line contact hole is etched with respect
to the second source/drain region of the

transistor using the mask (12), and
an edge insulation (13) is produced at least at
the points of the conductive layer (9) exposed in

the bit line contact hole.
Method of manufacturing according to Claim 1,
characterized in that, in order to produce the

auxiliary structure (11'), a planarizing layer is
applied over the entire surface and is etched back or

partly removed by exposure.
Method of manufacturing according to Claim 2,
characterized in that, before the planarizing layer is

applied, an auxiliary layer (11) is applied over the

entire surface.
Method of manufacturing according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the mask (12) is

produced by means of a chemical conversion of the
surface of the conductive layer (9) which is not

covered by the auxiliary structure (11').
Method of manufacturing according to one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized by the following steps:


application of a capacitor dielectric (8) to the
semiconductor substrate (1), the lower capacitor

plate (7) and a gate (5) which is encapsulated
with a gate insulation (6),
application of polysilicon as conductive layer
(9),
application over the entire surface of a nitride
layer (11) as an auxiliary layer on the conductive

layer (9),
production of resist plugs (16) in the depressions
(10), etching of the nitride layer (11)

selectively with respect to the resist plugs (12),
and removal of the resist plugs, 
oxidation of the exposed surface of the conductive
layer (9) in order to produce a self-aligned mask

(12) and removal of the remaining nitride (11'),
anisotropic etching of the exposed polysilicon (9)
using the mask (12),
exposure of the second source/drain region by
removing the capacitor dielectric (8) selectively

with respect to the gate encapsulation (6).
Method of manufacturing according to one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the edge

insulation (13) is produced by means of an oxidation
process.
