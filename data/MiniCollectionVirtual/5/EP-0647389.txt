<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printed circuit boards and more 
particularly to printed circuit boards including various devices or components to be 
coupled with individual passive circuit components such as resistor/conductors, 
inductors or dielectric/capacitors and compound circuit components (networks) 
formed from combinations of passive circuit components. The present invention is directed toward printed circuit boards 
(pCBs) and the like. These circuit boards typically include large numbers of 
electronic devices which are commonly surface mounted and also additional 
components which may be present in the form of active layers within or on each 
PCB. The requirements for the devices and components in such printed circuit 
boards are subject to conventional electronic design restraints. More specifically, many of the surface mounted devices and other 
components on such PCBs commonly require coupling with individual passive 
circuit components such as resistor/conductors, inductors or dielectric/capacitors in 
order to achieve their desired function. The solution to this problem in the prior art has been the use of 
individual discrete passive components commonly surface mounted on the PCBs. 
PCB design has further required the provision of through-holes in order to 
properly interconnect the passive circuit components. In this regard, the passive 
circuit components may be interconnected between any combination of surface 
devices or components, active circuit components or layers formed on or within 
the PCBs. Accordingly, the provision of such discrete or individual passive 
circuit components has increased the complexity of the PCBs and at the same time 
either decreased the available surface area of the PCBs for other devices or else  
 
resulted in an overall increase in the size of the PCBs to accommodate necessary 
surface devices and components including passive circuit components. A more recent solution to this problem in regard to resistive circuit 
components in the prior art has been the provision of planar components, typically 
resistors, preferably formed on layers of the PCBs to replace prior art surface 
mounted resistors as described above, thus making surface portions of the PCBs 
free for other uses. Although such planar resistors provide advantages in certain 
applications over discrete surface mounted resistors, they have still tended to result 
in relative increases in the complexity and space demands on the PCBs. For 
example, if the planar resistors are formed on a
