<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sustained-release preparation of an 
anti-endothelin substance, such as an endothelin antagonist, used to treat 
endothelin-associated diseases, particularly chronic diseases, such as chronic 
complications in diabetes mellitus. Showing various potent physiological actions, peptides have been 
applied as pharmaceuticals in numerous attempts. Their biological half-life, 
however, is usually very short; for a sustained pharmacologic effect, peptides 
must be frequently administered, resulting in severe suffering by the patient. 
Endothelin, a peptide secreted by the vascular endothelium, shows vascular 
smooth muscle constricting action, both potent and sustainable. Endothelin 
is therefore important both physiologically and pathologically. Also, there 
have been reports of the development of peptide-based endothelin 
antagonists, with the strong expectation that anti-endothelin substances such 
as endothelin receptor antagonists will contribute to the treatment of various 
diseases associated with endothelin. For the reasons described above, 
however, the application of such peptide-based antagonists as 
pharmaceuticals has been limited. Also, in therapeutic application of 
conventional endothelin antagonists, there have been attempts to prevent the 
onset and progress of pathologic states by antagonizing endothelin-associated 
reactions in acute diseases such as attacks and shocks of acute myocardial 
infarction. Although application to the treatment of hypertension, 
cardiac/cerebral circulatory diseases, renal diseases and other diseases has 
been suggested, there is no specific exemplification. Nor has there been any 
finding that administration of endothelin antagonists is effective in 
preventing the onset and progress of endothelin-associated pathologic states 
in chronic diseases such as diabetic nephropathy. Various sustained-release preparations are known, including the 
release rate controlling system based on a polymeric matrix containing a 
polypeptide dispersed in a poly(lactide-glycolide) copolymer, described in 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.2930/1988 (EP-A-251476).  Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 40329/1992 (Japanese 
Patent Unexamined Publication No. 118512/1982, EP-A-52510) discloses a 
composition comprising a biodegrable poly(lactide-glycolide) copolymer which is 
biologically compatible with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) 
or an analog thereof, a water-soluble polypeptide, and which is capable of
