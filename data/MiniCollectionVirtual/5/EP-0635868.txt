<ABSTRACT>
An electric incandescent lamp includes a metal getter strip (10, 20) 
secured to a filament. The getter strip has a closed circumferential bounding edge (12) 

which defines a closed aperture (13) through which the filament (4) extends and an 
integral retaining portion (14) biased against said filament for retaining the bounding 

edge between a pair of coil turns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric lamp having a sealed lamp envelope, 
an incandescent filament arranged within said lamp envelope and having a plurality of 
successive filament turns, means for connecting said filament to a source of electric 
potential outside of said lamp envelope, and a getter element secured to said filament 
for gettering impurities within said lamp envelope. U.S. Patent 3,317,264 discloses such a lamp in which the getter element 
is a disc which also supports the filament on the lamp axis. It is common to provide a 
getter within the lamp envelope to clean-up, or absorb, any impurities which remain 
after sealing. Such impurities might otherwise react with the filament when the filament 
after sealing is flashed by passing a current through the filament to crystallize and set 
the filament. The impurities then form vapours which condense in the lamp envelope 
and form a black deposit which reduces lamp efficacy. The disc includes a slot that receives the filament and has a thickness 
selected such that adjacent coil turns of the filament are spread apart and clamp the disc 
therebetween. Instead of the many discs used in said Patent, many commercial lamps 
employ only one or two of the getter discs and support the filament on the axis with 
conventional spiral wound wire supports. It has been found, however, that for many 
combinations of filament pitch and wire diameter, the discs are not adequately secured 
on the filament, but fall off during the lamp manufacturing process, in shipment, or 
during use if subject to vibration. If the getter falls off the filament during or after sealing, the lamp must be 
scrapped by the manufacturer because the getter will not function unless it is secured to 
and heated sufficiently by the filament. If the disc falls off after the lamp leaves the 
factory, the lamp will have a reduced efficiency and a shortened life. It has been found 
that even if the discs include tooth-like burrs as shown in U.S. Patent 2,980,820, or are 
manually bent against the coil turns by peening, the scrap rate is still unacceptable. 
Furthermore, the additional step of peening is labour intensive and stretches the filament  
 
coil, forming a cold spot which adversely impacts filament life. Additionally, the outer edge of the discs are disposed against or very near 
the inner wall of the lamp envelope. It has been found that reaction of these tantalum 
getter discs with the lamp impurities upon initial flashing of the filament forms dark 
rings on the lamp

<CLAIMS>
An electric lamp having a sealed lamp envelope (1), a incandescent 
filament (4) arranged within said lamp envelope and having a plurality of successive 

filament turns, means (6) for connecting said filament to a source of electric potential 
outside of said lamp envelope, and a getter element (10) secured to said filament for 

gettering impurities within said lamp envelope, characterized in that
 
   said getter element (10) comprises a metal strip having a first portion (11) 

extending across said filament (4) with a closed, circumferential bounding edge (12) 
which defines a closed aperture (13) through which the filament extends, and retaining 

means (14) integral with said strip and resiliently biased against said filament for 
retaining said bounding edge between a pair of filament turns. 
An electric lamp as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said strip 
includes a single said aperture through which said filament extends and a tail portion 

(14) having a end resiliently biased between another pair of filament turns for retaining 
the bounding edge (12) of said aperture (13) between its respective pair of turns. 
An electric lamp as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said strip 
(20) includes first (26) and second (27) opposing portions extending across said 

filament, each of said opposing portions having a respective said closed aperture (21, 
23) through which said filament extends, and said retaining means is comprised by said 

opposing portions (26, 27) being resiliently joined and arranged in the filament for 
generally axially biasing at least one of (i) the bounding edges (22, 24) of each aperture 

and (ii) the face of the strip adjacent thereto against a respective coil turn. 
An electric lamp as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that said retaining 
means is further comprised by a said one of said first and second portions (26, 27) 

having a tail portion (28, 29), adjacent its respective aperture, bent against said filament 
(4) for transversely biasing its respective bounding edge against a coil turn. 
An electric lamp as claimed in claim 1, wherein said strip includes first 
and second opposing portions extending across said filament, each of said opposing 

portions having a respective said closed aperture through which said filament extends,  
 

and said retaining means is comprised by a said one of said first and second portions 
including a tail portion, adjacent its respective aperture, bent against said filament for 

transversely biasing its bounding edge against a respective coil turn. 
An electric lamp as claimed in claim 3, 4 or 5, characterized in that said 

getter strip (20) has a length dimension and is bent along a line (25) transverse to the 
length dimension at the juncture of said first and second portions (26, 27) so that said 

strip is "V" - shaped. 
An electric lamp as claimed in claim 1, 3, 4 or 5, characterized in that 
said getter strip includes side edges (19) extending longitudinally along the inner wall of 

said lamp envelope (1), said longitudinal edges being spaced from said inner wall such 
that said lamp envelope is substantially free of blackening adjacent said side edges upon 

flashing of the filament.
