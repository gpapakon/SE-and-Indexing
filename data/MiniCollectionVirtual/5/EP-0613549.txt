<CLAIMS>
A weapons system of known type comprising a fixed reference (10), 
a launch tube (20) slidably mounted relative to the fixed reference 

(10), and a shock absorber (30) interposed between the fixed 
reference (10) and the launch tube (20), the system being 

characterized by the fact that it further comprises a latch (40) 
serving as an abutment for the shock absorber (30) in the launch 

position, to prevent the shock absorber (30) moving during an initial 
stage of launch, and sensor means (50) responsive to launch of the 

projectile and suitable for releasing the latch (40) so that it then 
allows the assembly constituted by the shock absorber (30) and the 

launch tube (20) to be ejected rearwardly. 
A weapons system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the means (50) are responsive to displacement of the launch tube 

(20). 
A weapons system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by the 
fact that the sensor means (50) are constituted by mechanical means. 
A weapons system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that the sensor means (50) comprise a nose 

(51) associated with the launch tube (20) and adapted to act on the 
latch (40). 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized by 
the fact that the sensor means (50) comprise a sensor suitable for 

detecting displacement of the launch tube (20) and for releasing the 
latch (40) when the displacement of the tube (20) reaches a 

predetermined threshold. 
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the 
means (50) are responsive to the projectile (60) leaving the muzzle. 
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the 
means (50) are responsive to pressure dropping inside the launch tube 

(20).  
 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized by 
the fact that the means (50) are responsive to the force exerted by 

the launch tube (20) so as to release the latch (40) when said force 
reaches a predetermined threshold. 
A system according to claim 8, characterized by the fact that the 
unlatching means (50) comprise a latch element (40) adapted to break 

when the predetermined force threshold is reached, e.g. the latch 
(40) is itself provided with a line of controlled weakness, or a 

hinge pin (42) for the latch (40). 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized by 
the fact that the shock absorber (30) is based on hollow metal beads 

or on a pre-buckled honeycomb. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized by 
the fact that the length of the shock absorber (30) is greater than 

the deformed length thereof on release of the latch (40). 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized by 
the fact that the fixed reference (10) is adapted for firing from the 

shoulder.
