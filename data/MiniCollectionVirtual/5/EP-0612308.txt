<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel methods for introducing one 
or two radioactive iodine isotopes into the 3-position or 
3,5 positions of the α-ring of an iodine thyronine 
compound and novel compounds which are particularly 
suitable as intermediates for these methods. The method 
according to the present invention is also suitable for 
preparing the corresponding thyronamine and 
thyrocarboxylic acid derivatives. If in the following 
description reference is made to "iodine thyronine 
compounds" or "halogen thyronines" or "thyronine 
compounds" in connection with the present invention, the 
corresponding statements shall also apply to thyronamine 
and thyrocarboxylic acid derivatives, unless a skilled 
person would understand that the corresponding specific 
passage would not permit such a broad interpretation of 
the above-mentioned terms.  
 The introduction of radioactive iodine isotopes, in 
particular the introduction of 125I, into the β-ring of iodo 
thyronine compounds such as triiodo thyronine (T3) or 
tetraiodo thyronine (T4) does not pose any difficulties in 
practical terms and can be regarded as a routine measure. 
By contrast, hardly any methods are available which would 
allow one or two iodine isotopes to be selectively 
introduced as labels into the α-ring of iodo thyronine 
compounds. However, iodo thyronine compounds labelled with 
radioactive iodine isotopes in the α-ring are of 
scientific and practical interest for various reasons. On the one hand, such compounds are needed when 3,5-diiodo 
thyronine (T2) is to be determined by classical immuno 
diagnostic methods such as RIA. On the other hand, 
thyronine compounds labelled with radioactive iodine 
isotopes in the α-ring have been found to possess a 
greater chemical stability compared to the corresponding 
compounds labelled in the β-ring which have been used so 
far. This greater chemical stability can be of advantage 
when the compounds are used as tracers in known 
immunoassays, as it allows an improvement in the 
storability and sensitivity and a reduction of the interfering 
background to be achieved. The thyroid hormones triiodo thyronine (T3) and tetraiodo 
thyronine (T4) radioactively labelled in the α-ring are of 
importance in research in connection with the 
investigation of metabolic processes, in particular in 
studies of the deiodinase type III. It is true that methods which may lead to iodo thyronine 
compounds with a radioactive iodine labelling in the 
α-ring have been described in the literature, viz. in J. 
Org.
