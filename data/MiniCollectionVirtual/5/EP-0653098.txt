<DESCRIPTION>
 ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE The invention relates "to ah energy storage device.Superconducting magnets are known for use as energy storage devices. However, a major problem with utilising a superconducting magnet is that the very rapid energy dissipation from and supply to the magnet results in significant stresses and strains on the windings with the result that these move, causing heat generation and the generation of a quench condition.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an energy storage device comprises an array of superconducting electrical coils made from low Tc material, the axes of the coils being substantially parallel and the coils being laterally spaced apart in a non-overlapping manner. We have found a way of practically embodying an energy storage device, for example an electrical surge protection device, using low Tc superconducting materials which overcomes _.he quench problem and thus enables rapid release and supply of energy from and to the device. In practice, energy is required for a relatively short time, typically less than one second and, following dissipation, the device must be reenergized usually within about ten seconds. This becomes possible with devices according to the invention.Further advantages are that arrays can be assembled to provide any field profile that a continuous track can create. "Further, they can provide profiles that in practice could not be achieved with continuous tracks if theory demanded the continuous track followed very small radii of curvature. Stress concentration and local strain arise in conductor near sharp bends increasing the chance of wire movement under e/m forces. As an example, it might be an advantage in some circumstances to shield the array using a "box permanent" magnet design using "cladding" coils. Each coil can be simply supported mechanically against e/m forces and thermal strain. Because of the, typically cylindrical, shape of the individual elements, windings maySUBSTITUTESHEET 

be simply clamped and "glued" into position without much risk of discontinuities. The short continuous length in each coil reduces the chance of discontinuous strain due to thermally induced volume changes in the coil. There is a greatly increased possibility to design the array for optimum distribution of strain energy such that small disturbances do not release a cascade of micro movement down a strain energy gradient.The invention allows systems to be flexibly connected to match load time of charge discharge demands. For example, a more
