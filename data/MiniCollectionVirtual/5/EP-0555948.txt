<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multi-stage geared turbo-compressor with a two-stage gear system having a central driving gear and an intermediary gear, in which the impellers of the compressor stages are arranged on the ends of the pinion shafts, at least one pinion shaft being driven by the central driving gear and the intermediary gear having a different tooth module engaging, on the one hand, with the central driving gear and, on the other hand, with at least one further pinion shaft. It is proposed according to the invention that the intermediary gear is designed as a triple gear (5), that gear (6) of the triple gear (5) which meshes with the central driving gear (2), having the larger tooth module, and at least one gear (6) of the triple gear (5) having a different diameter.

<CLAIMS>
Multistage geared turbocompressor with a two-stage gear 
system comprising a central driving gearwheel (2, 29) and an 

intermediate gearwheel, wherein the impellers (12-16) of the 
compressor stages are arranged on the ends of pinion shafts, 

at least one pinion shaft being driven by the central 
driving gearwheel (2, 29), and the intermediate gearwheel, 

which has a different module, being in mesh on one side with 
the central driving gearwheel (2, 29) and on the other with 

at least one further pinion shaft, characterised in that the 
intermediate gearwheel is formed as a triple gearwheel (5, 

21, 32), with at least one gearwheel (6, 33); (23, 24), 
which meshes with the central driving gearwheel (2, 29), of 

the triple gearwheel (5, 21, 32) having the greater module, 
and at least one gearwheel (6, 22, 33) of the triple 

gearwheel (5, 21, 32) having a different diameter. 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the triple gearwheel (5) consists of a 

gearwheel (6) which is arranged in the centre and has a 
large module and of two further gearwheels (7, 8) which have 

an equal, yet greater diameter and a smaller module and are 
arranged on the right and the left symmetrically with 

respect to the central gearwheel (6), the central gearwheel 
(6) being in mesh with the central driving gearwheel (2). 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the triple gearwheel (32) consists of 

a gearwheel (33) which is arranged in the centre and has a 
large module and of two further gearwheels (34, 35) which 

have a different, yet greater diameter (38, 39) and an 
equal, yet smaller module and are arranged on the right and 

the left symmetrically with respect to the central gearwheel 
(33), the central gearwheel (33) being in mesh with the 

central driving gearwheel (2). 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the two gearwheels (34, 35) having a  

 
different, yet greater diameter (38, 39) have a smaller, yet 

different module when compared with the central gearwheel 
(33). 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the pinion shaft (19), which is in 

mesh with the triple gearwheel (5), has a continuous tooth 
system (20). 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 2 or 
3, characterised in that the triple gearwheel (5, 32) is in 

mesh with two separately mounted pinion shafts (36, 37), the 
centre distance of the triple gearwheel (5, 32) with respect 

to the pinion shafts (36, 37) being equal (40, 41) or 
different. 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the triple gearwheel (21) consists of 

a gearwheel (22) which is arranged in the centre and has a 
small module and of two further gearwheels (23, 24) which 

have an equal, yet smaller diameter and a greater module and 
are arranged on the right and the left symmetrically with 

respect to the central gearwheel (22), the two outer 
gearwheels (23, 24) being in mesh with the central driving 

gearwheel (29), which has a staggered tooth system (27, 28). 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the pinion shaft which is in mesh with 

the central driving gearwheel (29) has a continuous tooth 
system. 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the central driving gearwheel (29) is 

in mesh with two separately mounted pinion shafts (30, 31). 
Multistage geared turbocompressor according to claims 7 
and 9, characterised in that, with the staggered tooth 

systems (27, 28) of the central driving gearwheel (29) 
having equal diameters (44), the two separately mounted  

 
pinion shafts (30, 31) have an equal or different centre 

distance (42, 43) with respect to the central driving 
gearwheel (29).
