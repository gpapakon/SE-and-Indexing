<ABSTRACT>
An immortalized cell line that produces antigen-specific human monoclonal antibody is described as well as methods for making this cell line. The cell line is derived from fusion of a human chromosome containing heterohybrid fusion partner with peripheral blood lymphocytes of a first seropositive donor. A mixed lymphocyte response is generated by incubating the peripheral blood lymphocytes in the presence of allogeneic lymphocytes. When the selected antigen is included in the incubation mixture, the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the first seropositive donor form secondary lymphoblast cells which are fused to the heterohybrid fusion partner. The resulting secondary immune response generates monoclonal antibodies of high affinity. A cell line which produces monoclonal human anti-IgE antibody is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND METHODS FOR HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTIONBackground of the Invention Immunotherapy is a leading candidate for the successful treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer and allergy. Immunodiagnostics and tracing agents that are administered to human beings also are desirable. The need for human monoclonal antibodies which do not provoke an immune response when administered to a human is clear. The production of human monoclonal antibodies, however, is problematic. Firstly, .in vivo immunization of human beings presents important ethical and medical considerations, and therefore limits the number of antigens that can be used for provocation of a human immune response. Secondly, ajn vitro attempts to produce human monoclonal antibodies have been severely limited by the inability to generate both a primary and secondary immune response άj**. vitro, and the production of monoclonal antibodies by the known methods have been largely unsuccessful in producing high-affinity antibodies.Human monoclonal antibodies have been produced using two general methods: (1) direct immortalization of antibody-producing human lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and (2) hybridoma formation between immortalized human or rnurine cell lines and human lymphocytes from an immunized host.Although the most readily available source of human lymphocytes is peripheral blood, peripheral 

blood lymphocytes (PBL's) have consistently performed very poorly when used for the production of human monoclonal antibodies, and peripheral blood has been considered to be a suboptimal source of lymphoid cells for this purpose. See C. Borrebaeck, J. Immunol. Methods, 123: 157-165 (1989) and references cited therein. In particular, workers have speculated that the antibody-producing human B cells found in peripheral blood may be less amenable to formation of lymphoblast cells as compared to B cells in other lymphoid compartments such as the spleen and lymph nodes. There is a generally unfavorable ratio of T suppressor cells to B cells in the peripheral blood of humans. Moreover, it has been speculated that peripheral blood does not contain enough antigen—presenting cells to permit in vitro immunization.Various complex and time consuming procedures have been developed to activate peripheral blood lymphocytes during in vitro immunization. Some investigators have attempted to separate individual blood cell populations and reconstruct a mixture of T, B and accessory cells at a fixed ratio in order to

CLAIMS
1. A method of making a human monoclonal antibody that is specific against a selected antigen, comprising forming a mixture of:
(i) a preparation of human lymphocytes, the preparation enriched for memory B lymphocytes and obtained from a donor that is seropositive for the selected antigen;
(ii) a preparation of human lymphocytes from a second donor that is allogeneic with respect to the first donor; and
(iii) the selected antigen, the preparations and the antigen present in sufficient quantities and subjected to conditions whereby a mixed lymphocyte response is generated between lymphocytes of said preparations, characterized by the production of secondary lymphoblast progeny of the memory B lymphocytes, fusing at least some of the secondary lymphoblast progeny with heterohybrid fusing partners, and isolating a fused cellular product that secretes the antibody with binding specificity for the selected antigen.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein a fused product that secretes an antibody with binding specificity for human self-antigen is selected. 


 3. A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the fused product secretes an antibody with binding specificity for human immunoglobulin selected from the group consisting of human IgA and human IgE.
4. A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the fused product secretes an antibody with binding specificity for human CD antigens.
5. A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the fused product secretes an antibody with binding specificity for a cancer antigen.
6. A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the memory B-lymphocytes are obtained from a donor with an autoimmune disease and wherein the antigen is a self-antigen involved in said autoimmune disease said self-antigen selected from the group consisting of self-antigens of Table II.
7. A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein the fused product secretes an antibody with binding specificity for human immunoglobulin.
8. A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the human immunoglobulin is selected from the group consisting of human IgA and human IgE.
9. A method as claimed in claim l, wherein the seropositive donor is seropositive for a foreign antigen. 


 10. A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein the foreign antigen is an epitope of an infectious agent and wherein the memory B-lymphocytes are obtained from a donor exposed to said infectious agent.
11. A method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the foreign antigen is an environmental toxin and wherein the memory B-lymphocytes are obtained from a donor exposed to said environmental toxin.
12. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the preparation of lymphocytes from the second donor includes splenocytes.
13. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the memory B-lymphocytes are obtained from a nonhuman mammal having a human immune system.
14. A method as claimed in claim 13, further comprising: immunizing a SCID mouse with the selected antigen, and collecting the memory B cells from the SCID mouse.
15. A method as claimed in claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 wherein the preparation of human lymphocytes enriched for memory B-lymphocytes is a preparation of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from blood or lymph nodes of the first donor.

6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 wherein a fused product that secretes an antibody having a high affinity for the selected antigen is obtained.
17. A method of making a human monoclonal antibody that is specific for a selected antigen, comprising: initiating secondary lymphoblast proliferation of memory B-lymphocytes by employing conditions of a mixed lymphocyte response, re-exposing said memory B-lymphocytes to said selected antigen and immortalizing a secondary lymphoblast to form a monoclonal antibody secreting cell line that produces said human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for the selected antigen.
18. A method as claimed in claim 17, wherein said proliferation is initiated in a preparation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
