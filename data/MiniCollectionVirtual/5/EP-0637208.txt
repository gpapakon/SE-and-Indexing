<DESCRIPTION>
 FROZEN CONFECTIONFrozen desserts or ice confection products are due to change fairly often because customers, often children, are continuously expecting changes of design, shape, flavour or of other features of the products.Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide novel frozen desserts or ice confection products having features not known to date, which products should be keepable during normal storage periods under usual storage conditions.The invention provides thereto a particulate frozen dessert or ice confection product which is characterised by a volume-average particle size of from 0.001 to 20 ml, the majority of the particles having a thermal transition temperature of at least -15°C and more preferred of at least -12°C. In practice particle sizes in the range from 0.1 to 1 ml are being preferred. For tropical countries and other areas where a stable storage temperature can not be guaranteed and power cut offs are not unusual a thermal transition temperature of -10°C or higher is preferred.A higher thermal transition temperature is achieved by altering the formulation to give a higher average molecular weight. For example conventional sweeteners such as sucrose and dextrose are replaced by corn syrups to achieve this purpose. Also the lactose content in any milk solids used may be lowered or even be absent. Maltodextrin can also be used.Determination of the thermal transition temperature is carried out by differential scanning calorimetry. About 10 mg of solution is sealed in a pan. An empty pan is used as a reference and the pans are crash-cooled and then warmed again at a rate of 5°C per minute. The thermal transition 

"temperature is seen as a change in the heat capacity before the ice melting curve. This change may be a step or a peak. There may be other small changes prior to this but the thermal transition is defined as the last change before the ice melting/dissolving curve.The use of higher molecular weight materials causes the water to solidify as an amorphous solid. This has negligible diffusion and is thus relatively stable. This stability allows preparation of stable particulate frozen confections.The shapes of the particles of the product according to this invention can be various for example globular or roughly globular r pillow shaped, rod shaped etc.These particles can be loosely flowable in the final product to be eaten separately or any desired number simultaneously but can also be sintered together by moistening with a cementing fluid material which is
