<ABSTRACT>
A sheet guide surface (34) is provided with an air intake port (36) 
through 

which a circumferential portion of a fan rotor (40) of a fan for drawing 
air radially inwardly through the air intake port (36) projects above the 

sheet guide surface (34) so that the sheet is drawn onto the sheet guide 
surface (34) at the position of the air intake port (36) while contacting 

the 
circumferential portion of the fan rotor (40) thereby being applied 

with a 
flexible driving force in the sheet transfer direction due to the rotation 

of the fan rotor (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the art of transferring 
a thin plate material such as paper or the like (simply called "sheet" 
hereinbelow), and more particularly to a sheet transfer device for 
transferring a sheet discharged from a nipping region between a 
printing drum and a back press roller of a rotary printer with one 
surface thereof being applied with a printing according to a rotation of 
the printing drum to a sheet receiving means such as a sheet 
receptacle. The belt conveyers are well known as a means for transferring 
articles, and of course a transfer of sheet can also be readily 
accomplished by using a belt conveyer. In the art of printing machines, 
a sheet transfer device using a belt conveyer for transferring a sheet 
discharged from a nipping region between a printing drum and a back 
press roller with a surface thereof being applied with a printing 
according to a rotation of the printing drum to a sheet receptacle has 
been proposed by Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 60-148864, 
wherein a rear surface portion of the belt conveyer is evacuated to 
hold the sheet on the belt conveyer by vacuum. By the rear surface of 
the belt conveyer being evacuated, a sheet applied with a printing on its 
upper surface is definitely held on the belt conveyer, requiring no 
means to directly touch the upper surface of the printed sheet for the 
sheet being definitely transferred to the sheet receptacle, together with 
an additional function available that the sheet which would remain as 
adhered onto the printing drum due to a strong viscosity of printing ink 
as in a stencil printing is effectively peeled off from the printing 
drum with no means to touch the printed surface of the sheet. 
Further, as was proposed in the above-mentioned publication, when 
raised portions are provided at an end portion of the sheet transfer 
route of the belt conveyer so as to engage the rear surface of the 
sheet at opposite side edge portions thereof so as thereby to lift the 
opposite side edge portions of the sheet relative to a central portion 
thereof held on the conveyer by vacuum, so that the sheet is thereby  
 
bent into a U-shape according to the progress of transfer, even a thin 
sheet is endowed with a rigidity which contributes to transferring the 
sheet definitely to the very end of the sheet receptacle. However, in the construction that a sheet is transferred by a belt 
conveyer evacuated at the rear surface thereof as held thereon by 
vacuum as described above, it is required
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sheet transfer device comprising a sheet guide surface 
(34), and a fan (38) having a fan rotor (40) which draws air 

therein from a circumferential region thereof radially inwardly, 
said fan having an air intake po
rt (36) open at a part of said 
sheet guide surface,
characterized in that
 
a circumferential portion of said fan rotor (40) projects from said 

air intake port (36) above said sheet guide surface (34), said 
circumferential portion of said fan rotor projecting above said 

sheet guide surface (34) being adapted to move in a direction of 
transfer of a sheet (26) on said sheet guide surface (34).  

 
A sheet transfer device according to claim 1, arranged at a position 
to transfer a sheet discharged from a nipping region (30) between a 

printing drum (12) and a back press roller (28) with a first surface 
thereof being applied with a printing according to a rotation of said 

printing drum toward a sheet receptacle (54), wherein said sheet guide 
surface (34) slidably receives the sheet (26) discharged from said 

nipping region along a second surface thereof opposite to said first 
surface. 
A sheet transfer device according to claim 2, wherein a position at 
which said circumferential portion of said fan rotor (40) projects 

above said sheet guide surface (34) is less distant from said nipping 
region (30) along a route of transfer of the sheet than a length of the 

sheet (26) in a direction of transfer thereof. 
A sheet transfer device according to any one of claims 1-3, 
wherein said circumferential portion of said fan rotor (40) projecting 

above said sheet guide surface (34) comprises an annular member (48) 
for increasing a friction in contact with the sheet. 
A sheet transfer device according to any one of claims 1-4, 
wherein said sheet guide surface (34) includes a pair of raised 

portions (52) at a position downstream of said circumferential portion 
of said fan rotor projecting thereabove as viewed in the direction of  

 
transfer of the sheet (26) so as to lift opposite side edge portions of 

the sheet above a central portion thereof so as thereby to bend the 
sheet into a U-shape as viewed in the direction of transfer of the 

sheet. 
A sheet transfer device according to any one of claims 1-5, 
wherein said fan rotor (40) has a larger diameter at opposite end 

portions thereof corresponding to opposite side portions of said sheet 
guide surface (34) than at a central portion thereof. 
A sheet transfer device according to any one of claims 1-6, 
wherein said fan rotor is provided by a combination of a plurality of 

fan rotors having relatively different diameters such that said 
combination presents a larger diameter at opposite end portions thereof 

corresponding to opposite side portions of said sheet guide surface than 
at a central portion thereof. 
A sheet transfer device according to any one of claims 1-7, 
wherein at least two sets of said fan rotor and said air intake port 

are provided along said sheet guide surface as spaced from one another 
in the direction of transfer of sheet. 
A sheet transfer device according to any one claims 1-8, wherein a 
pair of said fan rotors are provided with a symmetrical inclination 

relative to the direction of transfer of sheet together with a 
corresponding pair of said air intake ports so as to bend a sheet 

transferred thereby into a U-shape as viewed in said direction of 
transfer of the sheet.
