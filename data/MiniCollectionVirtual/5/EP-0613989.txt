<ABSTRACT>
If a so-called through-passage leaf (2) and a fixed leaf (3) of a two-leaf door, with respectively rotatably mounted leaves, can be closed by means of a door closer (8) and (9) and the two leaves are provided with a leaf overhang, then the fixed leaf can only be opened if the through-passage leaf has previously been opened by a certain amount or to its full extent. Conversely, the fixed leaf can only be fully closed if the through-passage leaf is fixed in a partially open closure position which permits the overhang of the fixed leaf to be pivoted past the overhang of the through-passage leaf. The through-passage leaf is arrested in this partially open position with the aid of the closing-sequence control means, in that, via the opening movement of the fixed leaf, a piston (18) acting as stop element is brought into the movement path of a sliding roller (13) of the through-passage-leaf door-closer sliding arm (10). Said piston (18) is retained in the blocking position by means of a throughflow valve (56). The closing end movement of the fixed leaf (2) opens said valve (56) and a hydraulic block for the piston (18) is thus eliminated, with the result that the through-passage leaf can also close to the full extent.

particular a hydraulic piston, that is displaceable by
