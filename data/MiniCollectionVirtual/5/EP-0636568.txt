A collapsible drum comprising flange plates (1) associated 
with a hub (2) made up of hinged elements (3), each of 

which comprises two portions (4) having respective ends 
that face each other and that are connected together, and 

respective opposite ends that are connected to respective 
ones of the flange plates (1) via hinge means (5, 6) 

disposed so that the portions (4) of each of the hinged 
elements (3) are substantially in alignment and are 

substantially perpendicular to the flange plates (1) when 
the drum is in an in-use position, and so that the portions 

of each of the hinged elements are collapsed so that they 
extend along a direction that is substantially parallel to 

the flange plates (1) when the drum is in a storage 
posi
tion, the portions of the hinged elements being 
provided with respective side surfaces (11) disposed so as 

to touch one another in substantially radial planes of the 
hub when the drum is in the in-use position, said collapsible 

drum being characterized in that it is provided with 
at least one reinforcing and locking member (22, 27) 

extending axially inside the hub and providing a resilient 
link tending to urge the flange plates (1) towards each 

other. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the reinforcing and locking member comprises a 

resilient cable (27) that is fixed to the ends of the 
portions of the hinged elements so also to act as hinge 

means between the portions (4) of the hinged elements and 
the flange plates. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the reinforcing and locking member comprises a 

cable (22) connected to the flange plates via resilient 
link members (24).  

 
A collapsible drum according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the reinforcing and locking member (22) extends 

through holes (26) in the flange plates and has ends that 
are provided with abutment pieces (23), and in that the 

resilient link members comprise resilient annular buffers 
(24) disposed between the abutment pieces (23) and the 

flange plates (1). 
A collapsible drum according to claim 4, characterized 
in that each of the resilient annular buffers (24) has a 

diameter that is larger than the diameter of each of the 
abutment pieces (23), and in that each of the through holes 

(26) in the flange plates (1) has a diameter that is close 
to or larger than the diameter of each of the abutment 

pieces. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the flange plates (1) are provided with cavities 

(25) in which the resilient annular buffers (24) are 
disposed, each of the buffers having an outside size that 

is substantially equal to the inside size of each of the 
cavities (25).
