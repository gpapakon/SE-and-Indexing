<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (60) is provided for 
insulation displacing termination of ribbon cable (12) 

having insulated conductors (14) in predetermined close 
centerline spacing. The connector includes a dielectric 

housing (15) having a mating face (20), an opposed cable-receiving 
face (22) and a plurality of terminal-receiving 

passages (24) extending between the faces for receiving a 
plurality of terminals. Each terminal includes a mating 

portion (28) toward the mating face and slotted U-shaped 
insulation displacement portion (30) toward the cable-receiving 

face. The insulation displacement portions of 
the terminals are arranged staggered in at least two rows. 

A dielectric cover (62) forces the conductors into the U-shaped 
insulation displacement portions and embraces the 

cable between the cover and the cable-receiving face of the 
housing. The cover includes a surface for engaging the 

cable and recesses (78) in the surface for receiving the U-shaped 
insulation displacement portions of the terminals. 

The surface of the cover defines a plurality of parallel 
conductor support channels (72). Each channel defines 

upper (74) and lower (76) conductor support levels arranged 
such that a lower conductor support level of one channel is 

between two upper conductor support levels of adjacent 
channels. Projections (82) are formed in each channel to 

hold a respective conductor therein. Therefore, the ribbon 
cable can be pressed into the conductor support channels of 

the cover and held on the cover for subsequent termination 
of the cable to the terminals on the connector housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical
connector assembly for terminating a multi-conductor flat
cable such as a ribbon cable.Electrical connectors have been provided in a
wide variety of configurations for terminating multi-conductor
cables such as integral flat or ribbon cables.
With the ever-increasing miniaturization of electrical
connectors and the ever-increasing numbers of wires in
multi-conductor cables, electrical connectors of the
character described have become increasingly complicated in
order to accommodate relatively large numbers of conductors
terminated in relatively small connectors. For instance,
a ribbon cable may have conductors on close centerline
spacing on the order of 0,635 mm (.025 inches). Connectors for such
high density ribbon cables are used in a variety of applications,
such as connecting disk drives in computers.Most electrical connectors for terminating ribbon
cables are of the insulation displacing termination type.
These connectors generally include a housing having a
mating face, an opposed cable-receiving face, and at least
two rows of terminal-receiving passages extending between
the faces. A plurality of terminals, most often stamped
and formed of sheet metal material, are received in
respective passages, each terminal having a mating portion
toward the mating face of the housing and a generally U-shaped 
shaped insulation displacement portion toward the cable-receiving
face of the housing. Some form of secondary
housing component, such as a cover, is provided for forcing
conductors of the ribbon cable into the U-shaped insulation
displacement portions of the terminals, with the cover
embracing the ribbon cable between the cover and the cable-receiving
face of the housing.One of the problems with connectors of the
character described immediately above, centers around the
high density of the conductors in the ribbon cable.
Because of the close spacing of the conductors, the
insulation displacement portions of the terminals are
arranged in two generally spaced-apart staggered rows with
adjacent terminals located in opposite rows. Therefore, a
conductor to be terminated in an insulation displacement
portion located in a back row will necessarily have to pass
between two insulation displacement portions located in a
front row. The close spacing of the conductors and
terminals may create problems and may result in shorting.
One solution to this particular problem is to utilize the
so-called "hill and dale"
