<ABSTRACT>
An ink container for an ink printer is disclosed of the type wherein a foam
member (48) is seated within a compartment (62) of the ink container in which

ink is drawn by capillary action through an ink outlet port (18) in the container.
The compartment (62) also has an air vent from which contact with ink is

prevented either by mounting a pair of ribs beneath the air vent (32) to create an
air space adjacent the vent (32) or by shaping a portion of a foam member which

would otherwise contact the vent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink recording devices and, more
particularly, to an improved ink supply container of the type that delivers ink to
a printhead from an ink impregnated foam member stored within a compartment
of the container.Ink jet recording devices include one or more printheads which eject ink
onto a print medium such as paper in controlled patterns of closely spaced dots.
To form color images, multiple printheads are used, with each printhead being
supplied with ink of a different color from an associated ink container. Thermal
ink jet printing systems use thermal energy selectively produced by resistors
located in capillary filled ink channels near channel terminating nozzles or
orifices to vaporize momentarily the ink and form bubbles on demand. Each
temporary bubble expels an ink droplet and propels it toward a recording
medium. The printing system is generally incorporated in a carriage type printer.
A carriage type printer generally has a relatively small printhead containing the
ink channels and nozzles. The printhead is usually sealingly attached to an ink
supply container and the combined printhead and container form a cartridge
assembly which is reciprocated to print one swath of information at a time on a
stationarily held recording medium, such as paper. After the swath is printed, the
paper is stepped a distance equal to the height of the printed swath, so that the
next printed swath will be contiguous therewith. The procedure is repeated until
the entire page is printed.Ink from the ink supply container is drawn by capillary action through an
outlet port in the container and into a manifold fluidly connecting ink to the
printhead. The manifold supplies ink to the ink channels replenishing the ink
after each ink ejection or firing from the associated nozzle.It is important that the ink at the nozzle be maintained at a negative 
pressure (sub-atmospheric pressure) so that the ink is prevented from dripping
onto the recording medium unless a droplet is expelled by thermal energy. A
negative pressure also advantageously ensures that the size of the ink droplets
ejected from the nozzle remain constant as ink is depleted from the reservoir. The
negative pressure is usually in the range of -0.5 to -2.0 inches. One known
method of supplying ink at a negative pressure is to place within an ink container
an open cell foam in which ink is suspended by capillary action. The foam is
generally a partially saturated, reticulated urethane foam. The absorption of the
foam member

<CLAIMS>
An ink supply container (10) comprising a compartment (62)
having a vent hole (32) therein, and a foam member (48) located in the said

compartment (62), wherein the container (10) further comprises means for
creating an air space between the foam member (48) and the vent hole (32)

thereby to prevent the foam member (48) from coming contact with vent hole
(32).
A container according to claim 1 for holding a foam member (48)
in at least one compartment (62) of said container, the compartment (62) having

a barrier assembly (55) located internal to said compartment (62) and positioned
so as to create an air space adjacent said air vent hole (32).
A container according to claim 2 wherein said barrier assembly
(55) comprises a pair of ribs (55A, 55B) mounted, respectively, to opposed walls

(62A, 62B) of said compartment (62), the ribs (55A, 55B) being separated by a
gap therebetween.
A container according to claim 1 wherein a body of said foam
member (48) has been shaped so as to create said air space when said foam is

seated.
