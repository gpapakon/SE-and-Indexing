<DESCRIPTION>
Aqueous suspensions of pesticides are well known in the art. For example, see 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (Applied Chemistry Division) 
"Pesticide Chemistry: Human Welfare and the Environment" Proceedings of the 5th 
International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry, Kyoto, Japan, 
29 August - 4 September, 1982. The use of inorganic salts to reduce the solubility of 
an otherwise soluble pesticide acid, base or salt causing precipitation of the pesticide 
acid, base or salt, a process known as "salting-out," is also known in the art and 
traditionally taught in university Chemistry and Engineering Thermodynamics 
courses. For example, see D. J. Shaw, "Introduction to Colloid and Surface 
Chemistry," London Butterworths, 1966. U.S. 4,936,900 teaches the use of carboxylic or inorganic acid salts to 
chemically stabilize sulfonylurea pesticides, or agriculturally suitable sulfonylurea 
salt dispersions. U.S. 3,157,486 discloses thixotropic pesticidal formulations comprising 
pesticides, suspending agents (clays), and surfactants. U.S. 3,333,942 describes thixotropic compositions comprising pesticides and 
surfactants. FR-A-2,146,504 discloses thixotropic formulations comprising herbicides, 
suspending agents, xanthan gum, and surfactants. Not disclosed or suggested in the prior art and the subject of the present 
invention are compositions of pesticides which are aqueous based, physically 
reversible structured-fluids which flow on application of shear and which 
spontaneously rebuild structure on standing. This invention concerns a thixotropic pesticidal formulation comprising a 
pesticidal component, a structuring agent, and the balance to 100% being an aqueous 
medium wherein: 
   the pesticidal component is selected from the group: 
a) a soluble electrolyte, b) a soluble non-electrolyte, c) an insoluble electrolyte, and d) an insoluble non-electrolyte; and   
 
the structuring agent is at least one anionic or cationic member selected from the 
group: 
e) a polyelectrolyte, f) a surfactant, and g) a suspending agent;  
   provided that:  
 
(i) when the pesticidal component is a), b) or d), then the structuring agent is 
g) and at least one of e) and f), such that e) and g) hear dissimilar 
charges, or when e) is not present, f) and g) bear dissimilar charges; (ii) when the pesticidal component is c), then the structuring agent is selected 
from at least one of e) and f), such that e) and c) bear dissimilar 
charges, or when e) is not present, f) and c) bear dissimilar charges;
