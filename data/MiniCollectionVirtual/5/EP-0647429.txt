<ABSTRACT>
A tool is disclosed, for taking a biopsy sample, 
having a needle (16) attached to a syringe (12), with an opening in 

the side of the needle (16), which can be selectively covered by 
a cannula (14) slidably mounted over the needle (16). The cannula (14) 

can be locked into place on the needle (16), and the plunger (22) of 
the syringe can be spring loaded to draw a sample into the 

syringe upon release of a latch (24). A method is also 
disclosed for taking a biopsy sample by sliding a cannula 

over a needle, inserting the cannula and needle into the 
tissue to be sampled, partially withdrawing the cannula 

from the needle to expose a lateral opening in the needle, 
maneuvering a sample of the tissue into the opening, 

cutting the sample from the tissue, and drawing the sample 
out through the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The method and apparatus of this invention are in the 
field of taking samples of selected tissue for examination 
outside the body of a patient. Specifically, the method 
and apparatus of this invention provide a means for 
inserting a sampling needle into the target tissue, with 
the opening in the needle being covered by a cannula. The 
cannula can be withdrawn to expose the opening to the 
tissue, and a sample obtained, avoiding contamination of 
the sample with unwanted tissue. In the diagnosis and treatment of disease, it is often 
necessary or desirable to take a sample of selected tissue 
from a living patient, called a biopsy sample, in order to 
analyze the sample as an aid to diagnosis and treatment of 
the disease. Such a procedure can be useful in diagnosing 
and treating various forms of cancer, as well as other 
diseases in which a localized area of affected tissue can 
be identified. In particular, a disease associated with 
the formation of a tumor often indicates the desirability 
of taking a sample of the affected tissue. In some cases, the tissue sample can be directly 
excised from the affected area, if the area is easily 
accessible, and highly invasive surgical procedures are not 
necessary. In other cases, the affected area is not 
readily accessible, and the biopsy sample should be taken, 
if possible, by means that minimize the physical trauma 
inflicted upon the intervening tissues that surround the 
affected area or target tissue. The biopsy sample 
procedure in such cases is typically performed by inserting 
a hollow biopsy needle through the intervening tissue into 
the target tissue to be sampled. Alternatively, a stylet 
with a notch in its side can be inserted, followed by a 
cutting cannula over the stylet. It is also possible to 
use the biopsy needle procedure in cases where the target  
 
tissue is easily accessible, to minimize trauma to the 
target tissue. Once the biopsy needle has been inserted into the 
target tissue, current procedure involves the withdrawal of 
sample tissue through the needle by placing a suction on 
the needle, such as with a syringe. As mentioned above, if 
the notched stylet is used, it is inserted into the target 
tissue, then the cutting cannula is inserted over the 
stylet to cut the sample tissue off in the notch of the 
stylet. These procedures and the associated apparatus 
suffer from several disadvantages. First, since the biopsy 
needle is hollow and open at the end, pushing the needle 
through intervening tissues to the target

<CLAIMS>
A biopsy tool, comprising: 
   a hollow needle, said needle having a closed distal end; 

   a lateral opening in said needle; 
   a hollow cannula coaxially mountable to said needle for selective 

movement relative to said needle to block said lateral opening; and 
   suction means connectable to said needle. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 1, wherein said selective 
movement is purely longitudinal relative to said needle. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 1 or 2, further comprising locking 
means for locking said cannula against pure longitudinal movement 

relative to said needle. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 3, wherein said locking means 
locks said cannula by rotational movement of said cannula relative to said 

needle. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 4, wherein said locking means 
comprises: 

   a locking barrel mounted on a proximal end of said needle; 
   a guide groove in a surface of said locking barrel; and 

   a follower pin on said cannula, said pin being positioned for 
movement along said guide groove from a first position where said 

cannula is locked, to a second position where said cannula is unlocked, for 
pure longitudinal movement relative to said needle. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 5 wherein:
 

   when said follower pin is in said first position, said cannula is 
prevented from purely longitudinal movement relative to said needle; and 

   when said follower pin is in said second position, sand cannula is 
allowed to have purely longitudinal movement relative to said needle. 
A biopsy tool according to any one of the preceding claims, further 
comprising a sharp edge on said cannula for cutting any tissue extending 

through said lateral opening, when said cannula is moved to block said 
lateral opening. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 7, wherein said sharp edge aligns 
with said distal end of said needle to promote ease of insertion into a 

patient. 
A biopsy tool according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said suction means comprises a syringe having a plunger. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 9, further comprising: 
   a male luer lock on said locking barrel; 

   a female luer lock on said syringe; and 
   a selectively releasable latch mounted on said syringe to hold said 

plunger in an inserted position within said syringe. 
A biopsy tool according to claim 8 or 9, further comprising biasing 
means for biasing said plunger toward a withdrawn position.
