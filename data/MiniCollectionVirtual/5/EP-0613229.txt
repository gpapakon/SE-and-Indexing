<ABSTRACT>
A brushless DC motor, whose stator (10) is a combination 
of stator yokes (11, 16), a bobbin (14) on which a 

magnetic field coil (15) is wound and to which terminal 
pins are provided, and a base plate (20). The stator (10) is 

fixed to the base plate (20) by a protrusion (12c) provided 
on the bobbin (14) or by a flange (18a) formed on a bearing. 

The widths of magnetic poles (11a, 16a) of the stator, 
which are measured in the circumferential direction of the 

stator, are smaller than the width of one of the poles of a 
rotor magnet (5). Thereby, the position of a stable point is 

a maximum excitation torque position. Further, a magnetic 
pole sensing element (21) is provided at a place which 

is shifted in the circumferential direction from the middle 
position of one of the magnetic poles of the rotor magnet 

(5).
