<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine includes one or more pistons (4), each of which is mounted to reciprocate in a respective cylinder (2) and is pivotally connected to a connecting rod (6) which is connected to a respective crank (10) on a crankshaft (7). The connecting rod (6) is pivotally connected to one end (11) of an elongate link (14) which is pivotally connected to an associated crank (10) at a point intermediate its ends and whose other end constitutes a rod (18) which is restrained by a mounting (20, 26) such that it may pivot about a pivotal axis (21) parallel to the axis (8) of the crankshaft (7). The mounting includes a first movable mounting member (20) connected to a second movable mounting member (26) to be pivotable with respect thereto about the pivotal axis (21). The first movable mounting (20) is connected to the rod (18) by a connection which permits only relative sliding movement in the direction of the rod (8). Actuating means (30, 32) is connected to the mounting and is arranged to move the mounting selectively in a first direction perpendicular to the axis (8) of the crankshaft (7) and in a second direction perpendicular thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal combustion engines of reciprocating
piston type and is concerned with such engines which include one or more
pistons, each of which is mounted to reciprocate in a respective cylinder and is
pivotally connected to a connecting rod which is connected to a respective crank
on a crankshaft, the connecting rod being pivotally connected to one end of an
elongate link member which is pivotably connected to the associated crank at a
point intermediate its ends and whose other end constitutes a rod which is
restrained by a mounting such that it may pivot about a pivotal axis parallel to the
axis of the crankshaft. The invention is also particularly, though not exclusively,
concerned with engines of the general type disclosed in EP-A-0591153.This prior document discloses an engine in which the or each piston is caused to
move over at least a portion of the cycle at a rate which is such that the graph of
its displacement against time differs from the sinusoidal shape which is inherently
produced in conventional engines in which each piston is connected to a
respective crank on a crankshaft by a respective connecting rod. In such a
conventional engine attempts are made to match the combustion of the fuel/air
mixture to the motion of the piston but the philosophy underlying the construction
of the prior document is that the combustion is permitted to proceed in the
optimum manner and the piston is caused to move in a manner which "follows"
the combustion and is related to the nature and progress of the combustion
process.More specifically, the prior document discloses an engine in which the piston is 
caused to decelerate and thus to move more slowly than in a conventional engine
at or around the point in the cycle at which ignition of the fuel/air mixture occurs
and then to speed up again prior to reaching the top dead centre position (TDC).
This is based on the recognition that in a conventional engine the piston is moving
at substantially its maximum speed at the point at which ignition occurs and the
compression ratio is altering at substantially its maximum rate and thus impedes
the rate of propagation of the flame front through the fuel/air mixture and thus
impairs the nature and completeness of the combustion process. However,
slowing the piston down at around the ignition point means that the rate of
increase in the pressure of the fuel/air mixture at the time propagation of the flame
front commences is substantially less than is usual which results in the flame

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine including one or more pistons (4), each of
which is mounted to reciprocate in a respective cylinder (2) and is pivotally

connected to a connecting rod (6) which is connected to a respective crank (10) on
a crankshaft (7), the connecting rod (6) being pivotally connected to one end (11)

of an elongate link member (14) which is pivotably connected to the associated
crank (10) at a point intermediate its ends and whose other end constitutes a rod

(18) which is restrained by a mounting (20, 26) such that it may pivot about a
pivotal axis (21) parallel to the axis (8) of the crankshaft (7), 
characterised in that

the mounting includes a first movable mounting member (20) connected to a
second movable mounting member (26) to be pivotable with respect thereto about

the pivotal axis (21), the first movable mounting member (20) being connected to
the rod (18) by a connection which permits only relative sliding movement in the

direction of the rod (8), that a first actuator (30) is connected to the mounting (20,
26) and is arranged to move it selectively in a first direction perpendicular to the

axis (8) of the crankshaft (7) and that a second actuator (32) is connected to the
first actuator (30) and is arranged to move it and the mounting (20,26) in a second

direction transverse to the first direction.
An engine as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the first direction is substantially
parallel to the axis of the cylinder (2) and the second direction is substantially

perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder (2). 
An engine as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein the actuators (30,32) are of
hydraulic type.
An engine as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 including control means
arranged selectively to operate the first and second actuators (30,32).
An engine as claimed in Claim 4, including a first sensor arranged to
produce a signal indicating that knocking of the engine is commencing, the

control means being arranged to operate the actuating means (30,32) to
move the mounting (20,26) in the first direction to decrease the

compression ratio of the engine and thus to cause the knocking to stop.
An engine as claimed in Claim 4 or 5 including a second sensor arranged
to produce a signal indicative of the load on the engine, the control means

being arranged to move the mounting (20,26) in the first direction to vary
the compression ratio of the engine with changing load.
An engine as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, wherein the control means is
arranged to move the mounting (20,26) in the second direction to

compensate for the change in stroke caused by movement of the mounting
the first direction.
An engine as claimed in Claim 4, including a second sensor arranged to
produce a signal indicative of the load on the engine, the control means

being arranged to move the mounting (20,26) in the second direction to
increase the volume swept by the piston as the load increases.
An engine as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the
connecting rod is inclined to the axis of the cylinder when the piston is at

the top dead centre position.
