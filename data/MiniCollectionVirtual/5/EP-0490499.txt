<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to packaging for semiconductor 
devices, and in particular to an integrated circuit 
package for encapsulating a semiconductor integrated circuit such 
as a memory chip and a backup battery for preserving memory data 
in the event of loss of main power supply. Conventional electronic circuit packages for semiconductor 
integrated circuit chips are adapted to enclose and seal 
the chip devices, while also providing heat dissipation, 
structural support, electrical attachment of device leads to 
external pin connectors, and electrical interconnection with other 
devices in the package. Such packages may be formed of one or 
more layers of a non-conductive material, with the semiconductor 
chip embedded within one of the layers. Flexible metal leads are 
extended from an interconnect region surrounding the chip to edge 
mounted connector pins for connecting the device input/output  
 
terminals to a printed circuit board socket in a host electronic 
circuit. An important integrated circuit product which is 
implemented on an IC chip encapsulated within an integrated 
circuit package includes a volatile semiconductor memory such as 
the static random access memory (SRAM) which is characterized by 
low power consumption and high memory cell density. The 
generation of valid logic signals and the retention of data in 
such integrated memory circuits having volatile memory cells 
depend in part on maintenance of power supply voltages within 
specified limits. In conventional integrated circuit memory 
devices, internal circuits sense the external source voltage being 
applied to determine if it is sufficient for reliable operation. 
In response to a low voltage condition, control signals are 
generated which cause active chips to be de-selected and 
maintained in standby condition. This is usually carried out by 
means of true and complement chip select signals, CS and CS, 
respectively, which inhibit read/write operations until the low 
voltage condition has been corrected. During the period that a memory chip is in the 
unselected condition it is necessary to maintain the charge levels 
of the storage capacitors in the volatile memory cells so that 
stored data will be retained. Otherwise, the information stored 
in the memory cells, including programs and data, will be lost 
when main power is removed. Although the loss of power does not 
result in memory circuit damage, the loss of stored information 
requires that the memory be reloaded with programs and data before 
proces
