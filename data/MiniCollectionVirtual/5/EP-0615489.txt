<ABSTRACT>
By using particulate material to take up an ink, the ink can be transferred to a plastics film at a high level of fidelity. The plastics film can then be laminated with another plastics film for security purposes to give a security document. Humidity and laminating temperature can be varied to produce a document which does not bleed or which bleeds after a certain length of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing and 
more particularly, though not exclusively, to the 
printing of plastics to produce documents which are 
harder to copy; it also relates to the construction 
of the document produced, intermediate products made, 
and their methods of manufacture. With improvements in photocopying, documents can 
be more easily reproduced. Thus, the forging of 
documents is becoming a major problem. The range of 
documents being forged is vast. The production of 
security cards, money, tickets and membership cards 
are just some examples of the areas in which forging 
and copying is proving difficult to control. Since paper documents also wear quickly 
there has been a desire to produce plastics documents 
of, for example, the type described. However, to 
date, the attempts to make plastics documents, which 
meet the needs of the user or operator, have not 
proved satisfactory. One of the problems with printing onto plastics 
derives from the colourants used. Firstly, the 
colourants used can be removed from plastics by the 
use of solvents such as acetone, thereby leaving the 
documents open to alteration. To overcome this  
 
problem attempts have been made to bond a further 
plastics layer over the printed layer thereby 
enclosing the ink. Two major problems have, however, 
become apparent. Firstly, it has been found that 
plastics, for example, PVC or polyester/polyethylene 
film will not fully bond to itself or each other where 
one or the other has been coloured with an ink or dye 
stuff. It has also been found that printing directly 
onto plastics and then bonding a further plastic film 
thereto, thereby encapsulating the ink or dye, proves 
unsatisfactory since the ink or dye tends to run/bleed 
immediately or within a short time, resulting in a 
blurred print. Whilst this problem can be diminished 
by drying the ink using high powered infra-red or 
ultra-violet light, the process is time consuming and 
expensive. It is an object of the invention to improve upon 
the known products and to devise a method for doing 
so. The present invention can be used to provide 
products which substantially do not bleed or which 
bleed at controlled rates. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a process for printing a 
plastics film, comprising printing a colourant onto a 
layer of particulate or colloidal material, which 
material is releasably bound to a backing;  
 
transferring the colourant onto a first plastics 
film by placing the first

A process for printing a plastics film, 
comprising printing a colourant onto a layer of 

particulate or colloidal material, which material is 
releasably bound to a backing; transferring the 

colourant onto a first plastics film by placing the 
first plastics film over the printed layer and 

subjecting the plastics film and printed layer to a 
substantially constant heat, and removing the backing 

characterised in that the particulate or colloidal 
material has a particle size of from 5 to 0.006 

µm (microns). 
A process according to claim 1, wherein a 
second plastics film is bonded to the first plastics 

film to encapsulate the colourant and the particulate 
or colloidal material. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the particulate or colloidal material is silica. 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the backing is parchment paper. 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the layer comprises 4 to 8 g/m
2
 or 8 to 20 
g/m
2
 of particulate or colloidal material. 
A process according to any preceding claim 
for producing a document having a colourant which 

substantially does not bleed, comprising 

printing the colourant onto a layer of  
 

particulate or colloidal material, which layer is 
releasably bound to a backing; 
transferring the colourant onto a first plastics 
film by placing the plastics film over the printed 

layer and subjecting the plastics film and printed 
layer to a substantially constant heat; 
removing the backing and laminating a second 
plastics film to the first plastics film at a 

temperature at or above 177°C (350°F). 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
for producing a document having a colourant which 

bleeds after a period of time, comprising 

printing the colourant onto a layer of 
particulate or colloidal material, which layer is 

releasably bound to a backing; 
transferring the colourant onto a first plastics 
film by placing the plastics film over the printed 

layer and subjecting the plastics film and printed 

layer to a substantially constant heat; 
removing the backing and exposing the layer of 
particulate or colloidal material to an atmosphere of 

above 40% humidity; and 
laminating a second plastics film to the first 
plastics film at a temperature below 177°C (350°F). 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein a U.V. sensitive or U.V. reflective material  

 
is inserted between first and second laminated plastics 

film. 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein one or more fibre optic fibres are inserted 

between the first and second plastics films. 
A document obtainable by a process according to 
any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the first plastics film 

is laminated to a second plastics film to encapsulate 
the colourant and the layer of particulate or colloidal 

material. 
A document according to claim 10, wherein a 
U.V. sensitive material, U.V. reflective material 

and/or one or more fibre optic fibres are encapsulated 
between the first and second plastics films. 
A document according to claim 11, wherein the 
one or more fibre optics are etched. 
A document according to any of claims 10, 11 
or 12, wherein at least one of the plastics films 

comprises an embossed portion. 
A document according to any of claims 10 to 
13, wherein the document is a label and comprises a 

portion having a removable hologram and an adhesive 
overlying the hologram. 
A document according to any of claims 10 to 
14, wherein the document comprises at least one region 

of weakness where the document can be manually torn to 
expose the silica to the atmosphere.  

 
A document as claimed in any of claims 10 to 
15 which further comprises a mark akin to a watermark.
