<ABSTRACT>
Inorganic material particles are dispersed in an aqueous medium with surface charge adjusting additives to give a moderately stable slurry or pigment grind. The dispersion can be used to prepare fully formulated compositions. Products formulated using the aqueous dispersion can be prepared to give the same performance as products including inorganic material dispersed with conventional polyelectrolyte pigment dispersants, but with higher levels of inorganic material, or superior performance properties with like levels of inorganic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the dispersion of inorganic material particles aqueous 
dispersions containing a polymeric latex. Aqueous dispersions of polymeric latex are used to prepare a tremendous 
variety of commercially important products, including paints, coatings, primers, 
mastics, caulks, binders for non-woven materials, and adhesives. Frequently, the 
polymeric latex is included to form a continuous phase as the water is lost in order 
to bind the product together, and to contribute important physical properties. In 
addition to the polymeric latex, most products include particles of one or more 
inorganic materials. Some inorganic materials contribute an important functional 
property to the product, such as fire resistance, sheen, flatting, hardness, color, 
texture, opacity, or toughness. Often these inorganic materials are relatively 
expensive, and it is desirable to employ them in the formulated product as 
efficiently as posssible. In other instances, the inorganic materials, for example, 
fillers, may be less expensive than the latex and it may be desired to incorporate 
the maximum amounts possible without compromising the desirable properties 
attributable to the latex, such as, for example, binding and tensile properties, such 
as elongation and, in the case of adhesives, minimum loss of tackiness. Since the 
polymeric latex is typically  
 
the most expensive component of the formulated product, 
inexpensive inorganic materials are frequently included to 
reduce product cost. In this case, it is desirable to use 
the greatest possible volume of the inexpensive inorganic 
material, while still retaining the desired performance 
properties of the product, since these properties typically 
decline when too much of the inexpensive inorganic material 
is included. A good example is a paint formulated with so 
much of an inexpensive filler pigment, such as calcium 
carbonate, that the critical pigment volume concentration is 
exceeded. Such a paint will provide a much less protective 
coat- ing for a surface on which it is applied than a 
similar paint formulated with slightly less filler, and 
having a pigment volume concentration below the critical 
level. One way of making efficient use of the inorganic 
material employed is by dispersing this pigment as well as 
possible. Agglomerated or aggregated inorganic material 
pigment particles frequently make less than their full 
potential contribution to the performance of the product, 
such as, for example, strength and resistance
