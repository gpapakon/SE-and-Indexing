<ABSTRACT>
A device for regulating the thickness of an applied coating. The device includes two members (12, 14) which define a gap (15) between them through which a web (20) can pass. A sensor (50) measures periodic variations in the thickness of the coating on the web. An automatic controller analyzes information from the sensor and converts the information into gap adjusting signals. Piezoelectric or magnetostrictive translators adjust the size of the gap to compensate for periodic variations in coating thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a device for controlling the size of a 
gap through which a coating is applied to a web. In particular, the present invention 
relates to a coating device for regulating the size of the gap to compensate for periodic 
variations in coating thickness. Coating devices are well known and are widely used to apply layers of materials 
to webs and also to form the webs themselves. Commonly, coaters employ a roll and 
a beam, or two rolls to form a gap through which a coating of a prescribed thickness 
may be produced. Examples of such coaters are roll coaters, knife coaters, and reverse 
roll coaters. Other coaters employ a slot orifice method wherein coating fluid is 
dispensed from a coating head in the form of a stream. One such slot orifice coater is 
a bead-coater, which is commonly used in the photographic industry. Slot orifice coaters 
use a backup roll to support the web as it travels past the coating head. Control of the width and shape of the gap between the roll and beam or the two 
rolls is important to producing useable coatings on both gap coaters and slot orifice 
coaters. In order to ensure that the thickness and uniformity of the web or coating does 
not vary beyond certain pre-set parameters, it is desirable to be able to adjust the size 
and shape of the gap to compensate for variations which may result over time (e.g. 
changes in viscosity, flow, temperature, and web speed, and wear of the die and the 
mechanical parts of the device). Numerous mechanisms are known to adjust the size of the gap between a beam 
and roll. One common mechanism uses helically threaded bolts which, when rotated, 
move a wedge placed between the bearing mounting of the roll and a structural extension 
of the beam. Because a force is applied to hold all three of these members together in 
physical contact, movement of the wedge changes the spacing between the beam and the 
roll. Another method employs threaded bolts directly. The bolts are threaded through 
a structural extension of the beam and their ends bear against the roll bearing mounting. 
Force is applied to hold the bolt end against the bearing mount. Rotation of the bolt 
directly changes the spacing between the beam and the roll. Still another method  
 
involves having a flexible beam rigidly mounted at only one or a limited number of 
points or edges, and placing a plurality of bolts which can bear against and apply force 
to bend the beam so as to effect adjustment of the size of the gap between the roll
