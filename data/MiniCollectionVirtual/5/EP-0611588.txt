<ABSTRACT>
A method for heating a sugar solution, characterised in 
that the solution is caused to flow along a tubular 

passage (66) surrounding a heated central tube (64), the 
tubular passage (66) being surrounded by an outer tube 

(24), the flow is forced around a plurality of diverters 
(70) which extend substantially across the passage (66), 

each of which diverters (70) deflects the solution from 
the major flowpath determined by the tubular passage (66), 

to induce eddies or small cross-currents in the solution 
flow, thereby to enhance the mixing of the solution and/or 

the heat transfer to the solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for heating a 
sugar solution and to heat exchangers for heating a sugar 
solution. In the preparation of sugar confectionery, such as 
fondants, soft centres for confections (candies), boiled 
sweets, creams, caramels, fudge, jellies, gums, pastilles 
and crystallised confectionery, it is known to pass a 
solution, which may be liquid or semi-liquid sugar, or 
sugar and glucose and/or invert sugar and/or gelling agent 
such as starch, gelatine or pectin (all of which are 
included within the term "sugar" in this specification), 
through a heat exchanger to cook the sugar or sugar mix. According to a first aspect of this invention there is 
provided a method for heating a sugar solution, 
characterised in that the solution is caused to flow along 
a tubular passage surrounding a heated central tube, the 
tubular passage being surrounded by an outer tube, the 
flow is forced around a plurality of diverters which 
extend substantially across the passage, each of which 
diverters deflects the solution from the major flow path 
determined by the tubular passage, to induce eddies or 
small cross-currents in the solution flow, thereby to 
enhance the mixing of the solution and/or the heat 
transfer to the solution. This arrangement can provide a generally annular cross-section 
passage for the solution, with heat being supplied 
to the solution inwardly from the outer tube if heated and 
outwardly from the central tube. In the preferred 
construction, the passage comprises an outer tube, 
concentric with the central tube.  According to a second aspect of this invention, there is 
provided a heat exchanger for the heating of sugar 
solution, characterised in that the heat exchanger 
comprises a tubular passage for the solution to flow 
through and a heated central tube extending along the 
inside of the flow passage, so that the flow passage 
surrounds the central tube, and an outer tube surrounding 
the flow passage, there being a plurality of diverters in 
the flow passage, which diverters extend substantially 
across the passage and are arranged to divert the solution 
in its flow through the passage from the major flow path 
determined by the flow passage. Preferably the diverters are attached to the central tube. 
It is further preferred that each diverter comprises a fin 
extending longitudinally of the passage and a lip bent 
outwardly from the fin. The lip may be curved away from 
the fin, and in the preferred construction, its convex 
side faces into the

1 A method for heating a sugar solution, characterised 
in that the solution is caused to flow along a 

tubular passage (66) surrounding a heated central 
tube (64), the tubular passage (66) being surrounded 

by an outer tube (24), the flow is forced around a 
plurality of diverters (70) which extend 

substantially across the passage (66), each of which 
diverters (70) deflects the solution from the major 

flowpath determined by the tubular passage (66), to 
induce eddies or small cross-currents in the solution 

flow, thereby to enhance the mixing of the solution 
and/or the heat transfer to the solution. 
2 A heat exchanger for the heating of sugar solution, 
characterised in that the heat exchanger comprises a 

tubular passage (66) for the solution to flow 
through, a heated central tube (64) extending along 

the inside of the flow passage (66), so that the flow 
passage (66) surrounds the central tube (64), and an 

outer tube (24) surrounding the flow passage (66), 

there being a plurality of diverters (70) in the flow 
passage (66), which diverters (70) extend 

substantially across the passage (66) and are 
arranged to divert the solution in its flow through 

the passage (66) from the major flow path determined 
by the flow passage (66). 
3 A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 2, further 
characterised in that the diverters (70) are attached 

to the central tube (64). 
4 A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, 
further characterised in that each diverter (70) 

 
comprises a fin (72) extending longitudinally of the 

passage (66) and a lip (74) bent outwardly from the 
fin (72). 
5 A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 4, further 
characterised in that the lip (74) has an outward 

projection from the fin (72) of the order of the 
thickness of the fin (72) itself. 
6 A heat exchanger as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 
5, further characterised in that the diverters (70) 

are arranged in opposed pairs extending to an equal 
radius to provide concentric central (64) and outer 

(24) tubes.

6, further characterised in that successive diverters 

(70) are offset radially with respect to each other. 
8 A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 7, further 
characterised in that there are two diverters (70) at 

the same longitudinal location in the passage (66), 
but arranged diametrically opposite one another, and 

two further diverters (70) arranged downstream of the 
first two, also arranged diametrically opposite each 

other, but displaced 90Â° around the cross-section of 
the passage (66) with respect to the first two

tube (64) extending out through a seal (68) at one 

end of the outer tube (24), so that it is possible to 
withdraw the central tube (64) from the outer tube 

(24) by sliding it out through the end of the outer 
tube (24), to permit inspection and/or cleaning of 

the external surface of the central tube (64) and the 
internal surface of the outer tube (24).
