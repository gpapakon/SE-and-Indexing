<ABSTRACT>
An extruder for rubbery materials includes an extruding 
unit (11) having a die holder (17). A horizontal 

lead-through groove (19) is formed in the die holder for 
slidably arranging a die plate (20) therein. A rubbery 

material is extruded through the die plate in a 
predetermined direction to form a strip rubber member 

(22) with a predetermined cross-section. A storing 
means (95) is arranged one side of the extruding unit 

(11), for temporarily storing a plurality of types of 
die plates (20) to be subsequently used on a storing 

table (43) in accordance with a predetermined use 
priority. The storing means delivers a next die plate 

from the storing table to a waiting position (T) along 
the extension line of the lead-through groove (19). A 

moving means (127) is operative when the die plates (20) 
are to be changed, for moving a current die plate 

together with the next die plate at the waiting position 
(T), along the lead-through groove in a direction toward 

the other side of the extruding unit. The moving means 
thereby ejects the current die plate from the 

lead-through groove and moves the next die plate to an 
extruding position (S) in the lead-through groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extruder
for rubbery materials, which is capable of exchanging
die plates at a high speed.Various types of extruders for extruding
rubbery materials are known. For example, JP-B-4-42,175
discloses an extruder which comprises an extruding unit
having a die holder with a horizontal lead-through
groove. A die plate is slidably arranged in the lead-through
groove of the die holder, for forming a strip
rubber member with a predetermined cross-section by
extruding a rubbery material through the die plate in a
direction perpendicular to the lead-through groove.
A cylinder device is associated with the extruding unit,
and has a piston rod of which the tip end is detachably
connected to the die plate. In this instance, when it
is necessary to form a strip rubber member with a
different cross-section by using the same extruding
unit, the current die plate has to be changed with a
next die plate. To this end, the piston rod of the 
cylinder device is moved backward so as to pull the
current die plate out of the lead-through groove, and
the piston rod is then moved forward so as to set a next
die plate and push it up to the extruding position of
the lead-through groove.Such an arrangement of the known extruder
suffers from a problem that, when the current die plate
is pulled out of the lead-through groove and removed
from the piston rod and replaced by a next die plate,
the operator has to perform manual operations for
changing the die plates because the extruder is not
equipped with a unit for these operations.A similar extruder for rubbery materials is
also disclosed in JP-A-57-210,839, which includes an
extruding unit having an extruding head formed with a
horizontal lead-through groove, a die holder slidably
arranged in the lead-through groove of the extruding
head, and two die plates which are removably arranged on
the die holder, i.e., a current die plate and a next die
plate. The die holder is moved by a cylinder device
along the lead-through groove. A strip rubber member
with a predetermined cross-section is formed by
extruding a rubbery material through the current die
plate in the direction perpendicular to the lead-through
groove. In this instance, the die plates are changed by
operating the cylinder device to move the die holder 
along the lead-through groove so that the current die
plate is ejected at the lateral side of the die holder
(the current die plate becomes the last die plate after
it has been ejected), moving the next die plate until it
reaches an extruding

<CLAIMS>
An extruder for rubbery materials, comprising:

an extruding unit (11) having a die holder (17) in which a
horizontally extending lead-through groove (19) is formed, and a die plate

(20) slidably arranged in the lead-through groove of the die holder, for
extruding a rubbery material (14) through the die plate in a direction

perpendicular to the lead-through groove and thereby forming a strip rubber
member (22) with a predetermined cross-section;
storing means (95) arranged on one side of the extruding unit (11), for
temporarily storing a plurality of types of die plates (20) to be subsequently

used on a storing table (43) in accordance with a predetermined use priority
and delivering a next die plate from the storing table to a waiting position

(T) along an extension line of the lead-through groove (19); and
moving means (127) arranged on the other side of the extruding unit (11),
which is operative when the die lates (20) are

to be changed, for moving a current die plate together with the next die
plate at the waiting position (T), along the lead-through groove (19) in a

direction toward the other side of the extruding unit (11), ejecting the
current die plate from the lead-through groove and moving the next die

plate to an extruding position (S) in the lead-through groove.
An extruder as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said moving
means (127) is arranged on another side of the extruding unit (11), said

moving means including a movable frame (101) and a movable pawl
mounted on said movable frame, said moving means being operative when

the die plates (20) are to be changed, for engaging said movable pawl with
a current die plate and a next die plate at the waiting position (T), and

subsequently causing said movable pawl to move along the lead-through
groove (19) from one side to another, thereby moving said current die plate

together with the next die plate at the waiting position (T).
