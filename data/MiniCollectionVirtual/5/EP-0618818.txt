<DESCRIPTION>
 SAFETY SYRINGEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to the art of syringes and more particularly to a syringe which reduces the likelihood of unintentional puncture or pricking of human skin. In recent history, the transmission of contagious diseases, particularly those brought about exclusively by the co-mingling of human body fluids, has been of great technological interest. One of the particular problems has been associated with the use and disposal of hypodermic syringes, particularly among healthcare professionals. There have been various devices developed for the destruction of the needles or cannula used in such syringes. Additional devices have been developed for capping of syringes which attempt to minimize the likelihood of accidental puncture. The accidental puncture or pricking of a finger, or any other part of the body, after the treatment of a patient with a contagious disease, particularly a deadly contagious disease, results in a high likelihood of transmission of that disease. Various syringes have been developed in the prior art to attempt to minimize the likelihood of accidental puncture after patient treatment.One such device is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,973,316 to Dysarz wherein a needle is retracted into the barrel of the syringe after the use thereof. Another such device is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,921,486 to DeChellis, et al. One of the earlier patents in this regard was U.S. Patent No. 2,460,039 issued to Scherer, et al. Various other prior art devices exist as well in the patent literature. While all such devices seek the same goal of preventing accidental puncture, considerable room for improvement exists. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is thus an object of this invention to provide a novel hypodermic syringe which minimizes the likelihood of accidental puncture. It is a further object of this invention to provide such a syringe which, after utilization, isolates the used needle so as to render such needle harmless.It is a further and more particular object of this invention to provide such a hypodermic syringe which is operable utilizing only one hand.It is a further and yet more particular object of this invention to provide such a syringe which automatically, upon the end of an injection, renders such needle harmless, purposely destroys parts of the syringe, and prevents its reuse.It is a further object of the invention to provide a simple device, which is easily manufacturable.These as well as other objects are accomplished by a hypodermic

<CLAIMS>
IN THE CLAIMS:
1. A syringe apparatus, comprising: a barrel; a plunger movable within said barrel; a needle assembly mounted on said barrel; a deformable base interconnecting said barrel and said needle assembly; sacrificial support means in said needle assembly for positioning said deformable base; a hollow needle containment tube formed in said needle assembly defining a passageway extending between said deformable base and an opposite side of said needle assembly; energy storage means within said passageway; a hollow needle passing through said passageway; an enlarged head on said needle within said needle assembly engaged between said deformable base said energy storage means; and a rupturable boot on said plunger for moving a fluid within said barrel through the hollow of said needle when said plunger is moved through said barrel toward said needle assembly; whereby when said plunger moves through said barrel toward said needle assembly a fluid is moved from said barrel through the hollow of said needle and when said boot contacts said deformable base continued movement thereof moves said deformable base downwardly severing said sacrificial support means with continued movement until such time as sufficient force is imparted to said rupturable boot by said enlarged head of said needle to rupture said rupturable boot, said deformable base then releasing said needle with said enlarged head due to the force applied thereto by said energy storage means to 


 project said needle with said enlarged head into the interior of said plunger.
2. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said enlarged head is wedge-shaped converging to an enlarged locking portion locked within said deformable base.
3. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said barrel has a termination on the end opposite said needle assembly and said plunger has an enlarged operating head, said enlarged operating head being receivable within said termination. 4. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said plunger is hollow on the interior thereof for receipt of said needle and said enlarged head and further comprising means within said plunger for capturing said needle and said enlarged head when it is projected thereinto. ~~ 5. The apparatus according to claim 4 further comp-tfi-si
'
hg an absorbent material near said rupturable boot to prevent release of any fluid contained in said needle.
6. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said energy storage means is a spring. 7. A syringe apparatus, comprising: a barrel; a plunger movable within said barrel; a needle assembly fixed to said barrel; a deformable base positioned between said barrel and said needle assembly; sacrificial support means in said needle assembly for positioning said deformable base; a hollow needle containment tube formed in said needle assembly defining a passageway extending between said deformable base and an opposite side of said needle assembly; energy storage means within said passageway; a hollow needle passing through said passageway;- 


 an enlarged head on said needle within said needle assembly engaged between said deformable base said energy storage means; and a rupturable boot on said plunger for moving a fluid within said barrel through the hollow of said needle when said plunger is moved through said barrel toward said needle assembly; whereby when said plunger moves through said barrel toward said needle assembly a fluid is moved from said barrel through the hollow of said needle and when said boot contacts said deformable base continued movement thereof moves said deformable base downwardly severing said sacrificial support means with continued movement until said enlarged head of said needle ruptures said rupturable boot, said deformable base then releasing said needle with said enlarged head to project said needle with said enlarged head into the interior of said plunger.
8. The apparatus according to claim 7 wherein said enlarged head is wedge-shaped converging to an enlarged locking portion locked within said deformable base.
9. The apparatus according to claim 7 wherein said barrel has a termination on the end opposite said needle assembly and said plunger has an enlarged operating head, said enlarged operating head being receivable within said termination. 10. The apparatus according to claim 7 wherein said plunger is hollow on the interior thereof for receipt of said needle and said enlarged head and further comprising means within said plunger for capturing said needle and said enlarged head when it is projected thereinto. 11. The apparatus according to claim 7 further comprising an absorbent material near said deformable boot to prevent release of any fluid contained in said needle from the inte¬ rior of said syringe. 


 12. The apparatus according to claim 7 wherein said energy storage means is a spring.
13. A process for retracting a needle at the completion of subcontaneous injection with a hypodermic syringe, comprising the steps of: forcing a plunger of said syringe downwardly to force a needle support deformable base downwardly and sever sacrificial supports; forcing an end portion of said needle to penetrate a base portion of the syringe and plunger; and propelling said needle into the hollow of said plunger.
