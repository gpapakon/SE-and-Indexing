<ABSTRACT>
A telephone set (1) has an analogue telephone port (2) 
for connection to an analogue telephone network, and a 

controller (13,21) for generating routing control signals 
at the telephone port compatible with the telephone network 

and being responsive to input signals to control operation 
of the telephone set. A power supply port (19) is 

connected to the controller (13,21) and to a power source. 
A serial interface (37) connects the controller to a 

processor (8), whereby the control means is responsive to 
input signals supplied via the serial interface (31,7) to 

control operation of the telephone set. The telephone 
network is isolated from each of the serial interface 

(31,7) and the power supply port (19) while permitting data 
transfer between the telephone network and the control 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a telephone set and telephone 
apparatus incorporating such a telephone set. A conventional telephone set has a base and handset 
and is connected directly into a public switched telephone 
network (PSTN). These telephone sets are often referred to 
as POTS (plain old telephone set). The conventional 
telephone set can provide a number of functions such as 
hands free operation but is fairly limited in its ability 
to provide a variety of services to a user. To achieve 
enhanced services, proprietary telephones have been 
developed which generate special, proprietary control 
signals at their outputs which are fed to proprietary 
switches which can then respond as required. The problem 
with proprietary telephones is that they can only be used 
with the corresponding proprietary switches. Several proposals have been made in the past for 
implementing telephone apparatus using a processor such as 
a personal computer (PC). An example is described in US-A-5065425 
while other examples are described in EP-A-0238255, 
EP-A-0535562 and EP-A-0451523. All these proposals, 
however, rely on proprietary digital techniques with 
digital telephone sets being connected to digital telephone 
networks. They are not suitable for use with conventional 
analogue telephone networks which are the most widely 
available. In accordance with the present invention, a telephone 
set has an analogue telephone port for connection to an 
analogue telephone network, control means for generating 
routing control signals at the telephone port compatible 
with the telephone network and being responsive to input 
signals to control operation of the telephone set, a power 
supply port connected to the control means and for 
connection to a power source, a serial interface for 
connecting the control means to a processor, whereby the 
control means is responsive to input signals supplied via  
 
the serial interface to control operation of the telephone 
set, and means for electrically isolating the telephone 
network from each of the serial interface and the power 
supply port while permitting data transfer between the 
telephone network and the control means. We have devised a new telephone set which can be used 
with an analogue telephone network such as a conventional 
public switched telephone network but which is capable of 
being connected also to a separate processor so that the 
telephone facilities can be controlled from the processor. 
This is achieved by providing the telephone set with a 
serial

<CLAIMS>
A telephone set having an analogue telephone port for 
connection to an analogue telephone network, control means 

for generating routing control signals at the telephone 
port compatible with the telephone network and being 

responsive to input signals to control operation of the 
telephone set, a power supply port connected to the control 

means and for connection to a power source, a serial 
interface for connecting the control means to a processor, 

whereby the control means is responsive to input signals 
supplied via the serial interface to control operation of 

the telephone set, and means for electrically isolating the 
telephone network from each of the serial interface and the 

power supply port while permitting data transfer between 
the telephone network and the control means. 
A telephone set according to claim 1, wherein the 
control means comprises a telephone controller connected to 

the analogue telephone port, the telephone controller 
responding to input signals to carry out normal telephone 

set operations. 
A telephone set according to claim 2, wherein the 
telephone controller is electrically isolated from the 

remainder of the control means. 
A telephone set according to any of the preceding 

claims, further comprising manually operable input means to 
enable a user to manually generate input signals, the input 

means being connected to the control means, whereby the 
control means is responsive to input signals both from the 

serial interface and the input means. 
A telephone set according to claim 4, when dependent 
on claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the input means is connected 

directly to the telephone controller, the telephone 
controller being operable in response to power derived 

solely from the telephone network when responding to input 
signals from the input means. 
A telephone set according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the isolating means includes one or more of 

an opto-electronic isolator and an isolating transformer. 
A telephone set according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the control means further comprises speech 

processing means for processing speech signals received 
from the telephone network into a form suitable for 

storage. 
A telephone set according to claim 7, wherein the 
speech processing means performs a compression algorithm on 

the speech signals.
