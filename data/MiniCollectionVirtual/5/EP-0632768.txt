<ABSTRACT>
A weight compensating and level maintaining vehicle suspension system comprising a vehicle body, a plurality of wheels (1-4) arranged in lateral and longitudinal spaced relation to support the vehicle body. Two hydraulic rams (5-12) between each wheel and the vehicle body, with one ram (5-10) of each wheel connected by a fluid circuit (13, 15) with a ram (6, 9) of the laterally adjacent wheel and the other ram (7, 12) of each wheel connected by a fluid circuit (14, 16) to the ram (8, 11) of the longitudinally adjacent wheel. A respective sensor (25-28) for each wheel adpated to generate a signal indicative of the positional relation of that wheel relative to the vehicle body. A programmed controller (29) arranged to receive said signals from each sensor (25-28) and compare the positional relation of the body with respect to a preset datum position, and a fluid adjustment device (30) operable in respect to a detected variation of the positional relation from said datum position to adjust the volume of fluid in the relevant fluid circuit to correct said positional relation if required.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEMThis invention relates to improvements in the suspension system for a vehicle, and is specifically related to controlling the disposition of the vehicle body relative to the vehicle wheels when the vehicle is subject to load distribution variation.In recent times there has been a trend towards resilient sprung suspension systems incorporating variable damping and spring rates in an attempt to improve vehicle stability and reduce movement of the vehicle body relative to the surface being traversed. Some other more advanced suspension systems, commonly referred to as active and semi-active suspensions, incorporate a number of electronic sensors which monitor information such as vertical wheel travel and body roll, as well as speed, acceleration, steering and braking commands. This and other data is processed by a computer which instructs hydraulic or pneumatic actuators to override the normal function of resilient springs in order to interpret, compensate and adjust the suspensions performance to suit speed, terrain and other factors in order to maintain a level ride and controlled distribution of weight onto all wheels. These suspension systems require an external intelligent back-up system, and call for substantial input of external energy, drawn from the vehicle engine, to operate the actuators that affect the adjustment to the suspension system.A range of constructions of 'active' and 'semi-active' suspensions for vehicles have been proposed including systems operating on the basis of compression and/or displacement of fluids and such systems currently in use incorporate a pump to maintain the working fluid at the required pressure and effect the high speed distribution thereof, and sophisticated control mechanisms to regulate the operation of the suspension system in accordance with sensed road and/or vehicle operating conditions. These known systems incorporating pumps and electronic control systems, which are both required to operate substantially continuously while the vehicle is in operation, are comparatively expensive to construct and maintain, and require energy input, and therefore have limited acceptability in the vehicle industry.There is disclosed in International Patent Application No. 

WO91/04877, a vehicle having a load support body, and a pair of front ground engaging wheels and a pair of rear ground engaging wheels connected to the body to support the body and wherein each wheel is displaceable relative to the body in a generally vertical direction.
