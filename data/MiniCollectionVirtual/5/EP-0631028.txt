<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a lock having a disconnectable rotor, of the type comprising a rotor (10) journaled in an intermediate stator (12), itself pivoted in a fixed body (14), members for locking with the rotor (10) and the intermediate stator (12) for linking them in rotation in the absence of a key, or in the presence of the wrong key, and for releasing the rotor (10) after introduction of the correct key, and of the type comprising a member for indexing the intermediate stator (12) with respect to the fixed body (14), which member is made in the form of an arm arranged in a longitudinal housing (33) formed in the peripheral wall (13) of the intermediate stator (12), characterised in that the indexing arm is made in the form of a bar (32) which extends longitudinally in order normally to occupy an indexing position and which can be elastically deformed in flexion in order to occupy the retracted position.

A lock with a releasable rotor, of the type 
comprising a rotor (10) which is rotatable in an 

intermediate stator (12), the latter being itself 
pivotally mounted in a fixed body (14), locking 

members, such as pallets or pairs of pistons, 
cooperating with the rotor (10) and the intermediate 

stator (12) for coupling them together in simultaneous 
rotation in the absence of a key or in the presence of 

an incorrect key, and for releasing the rotor (10) for 
rotation with respect to the intermediate stator (12) 

after introduction of the correct key, and of the type 
comprising Ã  member for indexing the intermediate 

stator (12) with respect to the fixed body (14), made 
in the form of an arm disposed in a longitudinal recess 

(33) formed in the peripheral wall (13) of the 
intermediate stator (12), in which it is mounted for 

movement between an indexing position, towards which it 
is elastically urged, and a retracted position in which 

it is at least partly withdrawn into the recess (33) 
against an elastic return force, the indexing arm being 

made in the form of a beam (32) which is deformable in 
elastic bending so as to occupy the retracted position, 

characterised in that the beam (32) is made in one 
piece, not fixed to the intermediate stator (12), and  

 
in that the beam (32) and the longitudinal recess (33) 

extend longitudinally with respect to the axis (X-X) of 
the lock. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 
1, characterised in that the beam (32) includes, on its 

outer radial face (42), a projecting element (48) 
which, in the said indexing position, is received in a 

longitudinal groove (58) formed in the inner wall (15) 
of the fixed body (14), so as to render the 

intermediate stator (12) fixed to the fixed body (14), 
for rotation therewith in the absence of a key or in 

the presence of the correct key. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 
2, characterised in that the projecting element (48) 

has in transverse cross section a profile in the form 
of an inverted V. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 2 
or Claim 3, characterised in that the longitudinal slot 

(58) has in transverse cross section a profile in the 
form of an inverted V. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to any one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the beam 

(32) has, on its inner radial face (40), a claw (60) 
which, in the indexing position, lies in facing 

relationship with a window (62) formed in the base of 
the recess (33), and which, in the said retracted  

 
position, extends through the window (62) so as to be 

received in a notch (64) formed in the peripheral 
surface (9) of the rotor (10) when an incorrect key is 

introduced into the lock. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to any one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that one end 

(36) of the beam (32) is rigidly implanted, and 
retained radially, in a recess (33) formed in the 

intermediate stator (12), and is immobilised 
longitudinally by means of a retaining finger (44) 

which is received in a corresponding hole (46) formed 
in the peripheral wall (13) of the intermediate stator 

(12). 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 
6, characterised in that the housing (38) and the 

cavity (33) are open in the peripheral wall (13) of the 
intermediate stator (12), and in that the outer radial 

face (42) of the rigidly fixed end (36) of the beam 
cooperates with the inner wall (15) of the fixed body 

(14) of the lock. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 6 
or Claim 7 in combination with any one of Claims 2 to 

4, characterised in that the projecting element (48) is 
formed in the vicinity of the free end (46) of the 

rigidly implanted beam (32).  
 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to any one 
of Claims 6 to 8 in combination with any one of Claims 

2 to 4, characterised in that the claw (60) is formed 
in the vicinity of the free end (46) of the rigidly 

implanted beam (32). 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the opposed 

ends (36, 41) of the beam (32) are engaged on 
corresponding surfaces (39, 43) of the base of the 

recess (33), and in that the beam (32) is elastically 

deformable in its central portion. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 
10, characterised in that the outer radial face (42) of 

one (36) of the ends (36, 41) of the beam (32) 
cooperates with the inner wall (15) of the fixed body 

(14) of the lock. 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to Claim 
10 or Claim 11, in combination with any one of Claims 2 

to 4, characterised in that the projecting element (48) 
is formed in the central portion of the beam (32). 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to any 
one of Claims 10 to 12, in combination with any one of 

Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the claw (60) is 
formed in the central portion of the beam (32).  

 
A lock with a releasable rotor according to any 
one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

indexing beam (32) is made in the form of an element 
moulded in plastics material.
