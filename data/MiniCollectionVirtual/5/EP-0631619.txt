<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reconstituted
cartilage tissue; to a method for producing reconstituted
cartilage tissue; and to cartilage tissue reconstituted in
vitro from isolated chondrocytes.Articular cartilage is a specialized tissue
found at the end of articulating bones. Cartilage, unlike
other connective tissues, lacks blood vessels, nerves,
lymphatics and basement membrane. It is responsible for
the distribution of load resistance to compressive forces,
and the smooth gliding that is part of joint function.Cartilage is composed of chondrocytes which
synthesize an abundant extracellular matrix, which is
composed of water, collagens, proteoglycans and non-collagenous
proteins and lipids. Collagen serves to trap
proteoglycans and to provide tensile strength to the
tissue. Type II collagen is the predominant collagen in
cartilage tissue. The proteoglycans are composed of a
variable number of glycosaminoglycan chains, keratan
sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and/or dermatan sulphate,
and N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides covalently
bound to a protein core. The sulphated glycosaminoglycans
are negatively charged resulting in an osmotic swelling
pressure that draws in water.Although, histologically, articular cartilage
appears very homogenous, the matrix organization and
composition differ from the superficial to the deep zones
(Aydelotte and Kuettner, Conn. Tiss. Res. 18: 205, 1988;
Zanetti et al, J. Cell Biol. 101: 53, 1985; and Poole et
al, J. Anat. 138: 13, 1984). Articular cartilage appears
to be composed of zones which show a characteristic
gradation of features from the surface of the tissue to
the base of the tissue adjacent to the bone. In the
superficial zone, for example, chondrocytes are flattened 
and lie parallel to the surface embedded in a matrix that
contains tangentially arranged collagen and few
proteoglycans. In the mid zone, chondrocytes are
spherical and surrounded by a matrix rich in proteoglycans
and obliquely organized collagen fibers. In the deep
zone, close to the bone, the collagen fibers are
vertically oriented. The keratan sulphate rich
proteoglycans increase in concentration with increasing
distance from the cartilage surface (Zanetti et al,
supra).Ultrastructural variation is evident between the
pericellular and interterritorial matrix areas. The
pericellular collagen fibers are much thinner and do not
exhibit the usual 68 run periodicity characteristic of
collagen in the interterritorial zone. It is not known
how these zones are established or maintained (Poole
