<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for adjusting printing cylinders (1-6) in rotary printing machines, having in each case a rolling bearing (13-18) which is fitted with a row of rolling bodies for the cylinder journals (7-12) and terminates relative to a wall bore (19-24) with a hydraulically deformable eccentric bush (26-30) which can also be designed, if required, as an eccentric outer ring of a rolling bearing. In order to allow with simple technical means both a radial adjustment of the printing cylinders and their printing operation without play, a separation joint (39, 51) to an eccentric bush (26-30), pressed without play into the wall bore (19-24), is subjected in each case to hydraulic pressure in an annular manner, causing the diameter of said eccentric bush to be reduced, and is relieved from pressure again after a positionally correct rotation of the eccentric bush (26-30). For this purpose, at least one annular cutout (40, 50) which can be subjected to hydraulic pressure is arranged in the region of the separation joint (39, 51).
