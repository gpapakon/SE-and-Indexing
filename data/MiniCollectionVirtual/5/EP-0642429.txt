<ABSTRACT>
A wheelchair (20) including a wheelchair frame (22) and a seat assembly (24) carried by the wheelchair frame (22). A detachable power drive assembly (32) having power driven wheels (40, 40') is releasably coupled to the wheelchair frame (22) and is mounted for selective removal of the drive assembly (32) as a unit from the wheelchair frame (22). Wheel mounting ports (76, 76') are also provided in the wheelchair frame (22) for releasably receiving a pair of manually-operable drive wheels (34, 34'). An anti-tip suspension (80) is also provided and includes a suspension arm (84) which is mounted to resist rearward tipping of the wheelchair by a non-linear restoring force. A wheel lock (108) is mounted for movement between a deployed operable position and a stored inoperable position. In the deployed position, the wheel lock (108) extends laterally outwardly of the wheelchair frame (22) for engagement with and braking of manually operable drive wheels (34, 34').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to 
wheelchairs and, more particularly, to wheelchairs 
including power drive assemblies. Wheelchairs have been primarily designed to provide 
transportation for the physically impaired, often 
emphasizing user comfort, portability and flexibility. 
Because of the individual needs and requirements of the 
wheelchair occupants, however, a variety of styles and 
shapes have been developed which cater to their 
specific needs. Moreover, most of these styles and 
shapes include power driven counterparts which, of 
course, are highly desirable. Powered wheelchairs generally include an electric 
powered drive assembly having a drive assembly support 
structure which forms an integral portion of a 
wheelchair support frame. Typically, the drive 
assembly includes an electric motor and battery, each 
of which are generally mounted to the drive assembly 
support structure. At least two power driven wheels, 
supported by the wheelchair support frame, are 
rotatably coupled to the motor and engage the ground to 
propel the wheelchair. Furthermore, the wheelchair 
support frame carries a seat support assembly including  
 
a seat and a backrest. The drive assembly is usually 
operably coupled to a joystick which permits the user 
to control the direction of travel of the powered 
wheelchair from the user operational position. While powered wheelchairs are highly advantageous in 
many situations, manually propelled or operated 
wheelchairs also can have many advantages. Moreover, 
if the drive assembly of a powered wheelchair should 
malfunction, for whatever cause, the wheelchair 
occupant may be left without a functional wheelchair 
for the duration of the repair period. Usually, the 
motor and/or batteries are individually mounted to the 
drive assembly support structure which, in turn, is 
integrally mounted to the wheelchair support frame. 
Repair of the damaged components often requires 
complete removal from the drive assembly support 
structure, and hence, the wheelchair support frame 
which involves a complex task reserved for the skilled 
technician. Moreover, removal of the complete drive 
assembly may require a piecemeal removal of each drive 
component. That is, the drive assembly cannot be 
readily removed from the wheelchair support frame as an 
independent unit. Thus, the whole wheelchair apparatus 
must be brought in for repair. During this repair 
time, the wheelchair user may be without recourse. Typical of such prior art powered wheelchair assemblies 
are

drive wheel (40, 40') mounted to said drive assembly 
frame (36) and operably coupled to said motor (36), 

characterised in that said power drive assembly (32) 
is removably coupled to said aft portion of said 

wheelchair frame (22) by a drive assembly mounting 
structure (52) including a first mounting element (54, 

54') carried by said wheelchair frame (22), a second 
mounting element (56, 56') carried by said drive 

assembly frame (36), and a fastener (55) releasably 
coupling said first mounting element (54, 54') to said 

second mounting element (56, 56'), said second 
mounting element (56, 56') including a positioning 

structure (70) for coupling said second mounting 
element (56, 56') to said drive assembly frame (36) at 

a plurality of positions changing the location of a 
center of gravity of said wheelchair (20), and a wheel 

mounting structure is provided on said aft portion of 
said wheelchair frame (22) and formed to releasably 

receive a pair of manually operable drive wheels (34, 
34') for mounting to said wheelchair frame (22) when 

said power drive assembly (32) is removed from said 
wheelchair frame (22).
