<ABSTRACT>
The machine for dispensing foodstuffs in liquid form, such as hot and cold beverages or soups, has a cup feed with a driven slide (7), in order to bring a released cup (1) essentially horizontally under the dispensing station (8), the total falling height (HB) of the cup (1) corresponding essentially to its height and the slide (7) being connected to a closing surface (11), in order to keep the dispensing orifice (19) closed when no cup is being dispensed. Such a machine with a cup slide and closing surface has a substantially smaller overall height and guarantees a reliable cup feed and, as a result of the closure, hygienically perfect conditions.

An automatic dispenser for foods in the liquid form, 
comprising a cup supply having a driven carriage (7) for 

the purpose of positioning a released cup (1) under the 
dispensing station (8) in an essentially horizontal manner, 

the total falling height (HB) of the cup (1) approximately 
corresponding to its own height, characterised 

in that said carriage (7), which is provided with 
means (6) for holding a cup (1), is connected to a closure 

surface (11) which shuts the dispensing opening 
(19) of the automatic dispenser in the rest position. 
Automatic dispenser according to claim 1, characterised 
in that said carriage (7) is driven by an electric 

motor (20) which is connected to a first lever (22), the 
latter being rotatably connected to a second lever (23) 

which in turn is rotatably connected to said carriage 
(7). 
Automatic dispenser according to claim 2, characterised 
in that said electric motor is a synchronous motor 

(20) which is provided with a cam disk (21) which acts 
upon the control system of the dispenser in order to 

control the two end positions of said carriage. 
Automatic dispenser according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the liquid is dispensed at a 

location (8) about 8 mm above the rim (5) of the presented 
cup (1). 
Automatic dispenser according to any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that said means for holding the 

cup consist of a holder (15) which surrounds the cup (1) 
above its equator and which is fastened to the rear wall 

(14) of said carriage (7).  
 
Automatic dispenser according to any one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the driven carriage (7) comprises 

means for the detection of the presence of a cup 
in said carriage, an optical transmitter (30) and receiver 

(28) being arranged in such a relationship that a 
cup in the removing position is in the beam path of the 

transmitter.
