<ABSTRACT>
An automatic paper web connecting apparatus 
includes a pair of blocks (70,70') arranged so as to be able to 

move relatively and be pressed against each other in 
the direction to cross a feed path for one paper web 

and a feed path for the other paper web, retaining 
mechanism for retaining the two paper webs on the 

respective opposite faces of their corresponding 
blocks by suction, a cutting mechanism for cutting a 

desired one of the paper webs, and a drive mechanism 
for relatively moving the blocks. The cutting 

mechanism includes a rotating body (66) rockable between 
the two paper web feed paths on the upper-course side 

of the blocks, first and second knives (86,86') fixed 
individually to the blocks, and a third knife (81) fixed to 

the rotating body. The rotating body is rotated 
between a first rotational position in which the third 

knife faces the first knife and a second rotational 
position in which the third knife faces the second 

knife. The desired one paper web is cut by means of 
the third knife and one of the first and second 

knives, which is selected depending on the rotational 
position of the rotating body, while the blocks are 

moving relatively to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
belt-shaped material connecting apparatus according to the preamble 
of claim 1. In tobacco binding operation of a cigarette 
manufacturing machine, for example, a paper web should 
be supplied without a break. To attain this, a number 
of reels each wound with a paper web are provided so 
that a reel with a new or virgin paper web can be set 
in position before the remainder of a paper web on a 
reel in service is reduced to zero, that is, before 
the in-service reel is emptied. In this case, the 
leading end of the virgin web is connected to the in-service 
web by means of a paper web connecting unit, 
and the in-service web is cut off. Thus, the used and 
virgin paper webs are connected. Generally, a paper 
web feeding apparatus can be fitted with two reels so 
that when the remainder of a paper web on one reel 
becomes insufficient, a virgin paper web can be fed 
from the other reel. After connecting the virgin web 
to the in-service web, the paper web connecting unit 
cuts off the latter. When the remainder of the new 
paper web becomes insufficient after the replacement, 
another virgin paper web is supplied from another reel 
which is set in place of the empty reel in the feeding 
apparatus. The new virgin web is connected to the in-service 
web by means of the connecting unit, and the 
in-service web is then cut off. This operation is 
repeatedly performed so that the paper web can be 
continuously supplied to a winder. Packaging  
 
materials are connected in like manner in a packaging 
material feeding apparatus which is used to feed 
packaging materials, such as paper, to a packaging 
machine, in a cigarette manufacturing machine. In connecting and cutting the paper webs or other 
belt-shaped materials alternately supplied from the 
two systems as described above, the one paper web is 
fed through its corresponding feed path, an the other 
paper web through another feed path. Each feed path 
is defined by upper-course feed rollers, guide roller, 
feed belt, and lower-course feed rollers. Each paper 
web is cut by means of a cutter which is formed of a 
stationary knife and a rotating knife, arranged 
between the upper-course feed rollers and the guide 
roller. In connecting the virgin paper web to the paper 
web in service, the leading end of the virgin web is 
delivered to the lower-course feed rollers in a manner 
such that it is retained on the feed belt by suction, 
while the in-service web is cut, by means of the 
cutter, in a position where

<CLAIMS>
An automatic belt-shaped material connecting apparatus 
which includes 


a pair of blocks (70, 70') arranged so as to be able to 
move relatively and be pressed against each other in a 

direction to cross a feed path for a first belt-shaped 
material (1) and a feed path for a second belt-shaped 

material (1'); 
retaining means (70a) for retaining the first and second 
belt-shaped materials (1, 1') on respective opposite faces 

of said pair of blocks (70, 70'); 
cutting means (80, 81, 82, 86, 86'), associated with said 
pair of blocks (70, 70'), for cutting a desired one of the 

first and second belt-shaped materials; and 
driving means (72, 79, 79') for relatively moving said 
pair of blocks, whereby the desired one belt-shaped 

material is cut by means of said cutting means (80, 81, 82, 
86, 86') while said pair of blocks are moving relatively to 

each other, wherein 
said pair of blocks (70, 70') are arranged so as to be able 
to move linearly; 
said driving means (72, 79, 79') is operable to 
linearly move said pair of blocks (70, 70');
 
characterized in that 
said pair of blocks (70, 70') are slidably placed on 
corresponding rails (76) which are fixed to a wall of the 

apparatus;  
 
said cutting means (80, 81, 82, 86, 86') includes a 
rotating body (80) rockable between the feed paths for the
