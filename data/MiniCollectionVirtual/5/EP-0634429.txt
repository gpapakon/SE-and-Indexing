<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a block copolymer of an α-olefin 
and a vinyl compound is here disclosed which 

comprises the steps of polymerizing an olefin selected 
from ethylene and the α-olefin having 3 or more carbon 

atoms by the use of a divalent or a trivalent rare 
earth metal complex, and then polymerizing a vinyl 

compound, a vinylidene compound or a lactone. According 
to the process of the present invention, a polar group can 

be introduced into a polyolefin, whereby the 
characteristics of the polymer can be effectively 

improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing a block copolymer of a monoolefin and a vinyl
compound, a vinylidene compound or a lactone. More
specifically, it relates to a process for preparing the
above-mentioned block copolymer in accordance with a
living polymerization method by the use of a specific
catalyst.In general, a polyolefin is poor in chemical
reactivity and adhesive properties to another resin, is
hardly dyed with a dye or a pigment, and has a large gas
permeability.In order to solve these problems, it has been carried
out to graft-polymerize a monomer having a polar group to
a polyolefin.Alternatively, as another method, it has already been
reported by the same inventors as in this application that
by the use of a lanthanoide catalyst, methyl methacrylate
or a lactone can be further block-copolymerized to a 
polymerization-active terminal at which ethylene is
polymerized (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
255116/1991 & which corresponds to U.S. Patent Nos.
5132369 and 5218064). This publication discloses that
according to the above method, the block copolymer of
ethylene and the vinyl compound or the lactone can be
prepared, but a block copolymer of an α-olefin having 3 or
more carbon atoms and a vinyl compound or a lactone is not
disclosed anywhere. The polymerization of ethylene is
relatively simple, and a copolymer with ethylene can also
easily be prepared. For example, the ethylene copolymer
can easily be prepared even in accordance with a radical
polymerization method. As random copolymers, copolymers
of ethylene-acrylate, ethylene-vinyl acetate and the like
have been industrially produced in large quantities.
However, if the preparation of a copolymer by the use of
an α-olefin of 3 or more carbon atoms such as propylene is
intended in accordance with a similar procedure, the
molecular weight of the obtained copolymer is low, and for
this reason, it is very difficult to obtain the useful
copolymer. Thus, any effective method has not been known.
In the above-mentioned patent, the block copolymer of
ethylene has been disclosed, but copolymer of an α-olefin
having 3 or more carbon atoms is neither disclosed nor
suggested anywhere.The method disclosed in the above-identified Patent 
cannot polymerize an α-olefin having 3 or more carbon
atoms, such as propylene, and therefore the method is not
capable of obtaining a block copolymer of an α-olefin
having 3 or more carbon atoms and a vinyl compound or a
lactone.The present inventors have intensively investigated
into a
