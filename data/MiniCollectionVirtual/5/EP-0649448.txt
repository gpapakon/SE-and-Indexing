<ABSTRACT>
A corrosion protection material and method for non-metal alloys, particularly light aluminium alloys. The method comprises the steps of coating a material to be protected with a layer containing  a chromium-free inhibitor, consisting of at least one dihydroxyazoic salt having structural unit (a), wherein Y is a salt producing anion and M is a metal. For the same number of moles, protection with an effectiveness comparable to that of chromate inhibitors may thus be achieved.

Method for protecting a metallic non-ferrous 
material against corrosion, characterised in that it 

consists in coating said material with a layer entirely free 
from chromium and containing at least one azodihydroxide 

salt with a solubility in water between 0.01 g/l and 3 g/l, 
whereby the general structure of said salt is as follows: 


 
Y being a salt-forming anion and M a metal. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
use is made of an azodihydroxide salt with a solubility 

between 0.1 g/l and 1.5 g/l, the group Y being a sulfonate 
and the metal M zinc, tin, strontium or another alkaline-earth 

metal. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that use is made of an azodihydroxide salt 

with the following chemical formula 

 
where Y is a salt-forming anion and M is a bivalent metal. 
Method according to one of Claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that use is made of an azodihydroxide salt  

 
with a mean granulometric size of less than 7 microns. 
Method according to one of Claims 1, 2, 3 or 4, in 
which the azodihydroxide salt is admixed to a liquid binder 

appropriate for the metallic material which is to be 
protected, the mixture being applied to the surface of said 

material so as to form a primary protecting layer. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that use is made of a binder containing an insoluble mineral 

compound pertaining to the following group: zinc phosphate, 
zinc borate, talcum, titanium oxide. 
Method according to one of Claims 5 or 6, in which 
between 5% and 30% by weight of azodihydroxide salt is 

admixed to the binder. 
Application of the method according to one of 
Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 for protecting a metallic 

material constituted by an alloy pertaining to the following 
group: aluminium-magnesium (type 5154), aluminium-magnesium-copper 

(type 2024), aluminium-magnesium-zinc (type 7075). 
Product for protecting non-ferrous metallic 
materials such as aluminium-based alloys against corrosion, 

characterised in that it is constituted by a mixture 
entirely free from chromium and comprising a binder and a 

corrosion inhibitor constituted by at least one 
azodihydroxide salt with a solubility in water between 

0.01 g/l and 3 g/l, the general structure of said salt being 
as follows: 


 
where Y is a salt-forming anion and M a bivalent metal 

pertaining to the group: zinc, tin, strontium or another  
 

alkaline-earth metal. 
Protective product according to Claim 9, in which 
Y is the sulfonate anion and M the metal zinc. 
Protective product according to one of Claims 9 
or 10, characterised in that the azodihydroxide salt is 

combined with grains of an insoluble mineral compound with a 
granulometric size of less than 7 microns. 
Protective product according to one of Claims 9, 

10 or 11, characterised in that it contains an 
azodihydroxide salt with the following formula: 


Method for manufacturing a corrosion inhibitor 
according to Claim 11, characterised in that (a) a watersoluble 

azodihydroxide salt, in particular an azodihydroxide 
salt of sodium, (b) an insoluble mineral compound with a 

granulometric size of less than 7 microns, in particular a 
phosphate, a silicate or an oxide, and (c) a soluble metal 

salt M are mixed in aqueous medium so as to precipitate the 
azodihydroxide salt of the metal M onto the grains of the 

mineral compound.
