<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sulfur-containing
hydrocarbons which also contains electron withdrawing
groups covalently bonded to a silane, such as a
trialkoxysilane, and to such intermediate compounds
which are covalently bonded to hydrophilic solid
supports and to processes for removing, separating and
concentrating certain desired ions from solutions
wherein such ions may be admixed with other ions which
may be present in much higher concentrations by the use
of such sulfur-containing hydrocarbons containing
electron withdrawing groups bonded to such solid
supports. More particularly, this invention relates to
a process for removing such ions from an admixture with
others in solution by forming a complex of the desired
ions with compositions composed of sulfur-containing
hydrocarbons containing electron withdrawing groups
bonded to such solid supports by flowing such solutions
through a column packed with such sulfur-containing
hydrocarbons containing electron withdrawing group solid
supported materials and then selectively breaking the
complex of the desired ion from the compositions to which
such ion has become attached by flowing a receiving
liquid in much smaller volume than the volume of
solution passed through the column to remove and
concentrate the desired ions in solution in the
receiving liquid. The concentrated ions thus removed
may then be recovered by known methods.Effective methods for the recovery and/or
separation of particular ions such as ruthenium,
palladium, gold, silver, and mercury ions in either
cation or complex anion form from solutions thereof,
admixed with chelating agents and/or other ions which 
may be present, represent a real need in modern
technology. As specific examples, efficient and
economical separation of (1) small amounts of Ru, Pd,
Au, Ag, from industrial concentrates; (2) separation of
Ru, Pd, Au, and Ag, from solutions containing large
amounts of base metals; and (3) separation of Hg as
toxic wastes from acidic solutions, all represent real
separation needs with presently either unsatisfactory
technologies for their accomplishment, or for which more
economical technologies are desired. These ions are
often present at low concentrations in solutions
containing other ions at much greater concentrations.
Hence, there is a real need for a process to selectively
concentrate and recover these ions.The fact is known that macrocyclic polythioethers
and certain other sulfur-containing hydrocarbon ligands
present as solutes in a solvent such as water are
characterized by
