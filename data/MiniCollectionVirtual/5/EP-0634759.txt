<ABSTRACT>
To produce a semihard (half-hard, medium-hard), deformable iron-based permanent magnet alloy, an austenitic alloy is used, which is metastable owing to the addition of more than 5% of nickel and/or manganese, and which, in order to set a coercive field strength from over 40 up to 100 A/cm and a remanent induction (remanent flux density) of more than 0.8 T, contains a proportion of from 4.5 to less than 25% of cobalt.
