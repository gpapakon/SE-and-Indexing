<CLAIMS>
A system for recognizing and managing a battery including at least one
electrochemical cell connected to an application (30), the system comprising

an electronic memory (2) placed in said battery (17) comprising:

a non-erasable first portion (6); and
a second portion (7) which may be modified or erased, and which
contains information about the operation and the state of said battery (17);
the system being characterized by the fact that said non-erasable first
portion (6) contains information enabling said battery (17) to be identified, and

by the fact that it comprises read means for reading from said memory and
write means for writing in said memory, said read means and said write

means being placed in said application.
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said first
portion of the memory contains data written by the manufacturer.
A system according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that said first
portion of the memory contains data written by the user.
A system according to any preceding claim, characterized by the fact that
said first portion of the memory of said electrochemical cell contains at least

one item of data chosen from the following items of data:

type of the electrochemical couple;
nominal voltage;
nominal capacity;
rechargeability;
maximum and minimum voltage thresholds;
self-discharge;
reference of the product; and
name of the manufacturer.
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said second
portion of the memory of said electrochemical cell contains at least one item

of data chosen from the following items of data:

instantaneous capacity;
updated nominal capacity; and
cumulative discharged capacity.
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said read
means enable the application to become informed of the data contained in

said memory.
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said write
means enable the application to modify the data contained in said second

portion of the memory, and to write additional data therein.
A system according to claim 1, where said application is chosen from
mobile loads that consume current supplied by said electrochemical cells.
A system according to claim 1, where said application is a charger and said
electrochemical cells are chosen from rechargeable electrochemical cells.
