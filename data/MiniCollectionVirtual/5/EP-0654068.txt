<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of applying markings to road surfaces, the method calling for a water-dilutable disperse paint which can be coagulated by acid to be brought in contact with an acid. The acid is scattered of sprayed, in the form of an aqueous solution, on a powder on particles wetted with acid, to or into the dispersion after the dispersion has been sprayed on to the road surface. Markings applied using this method dry within only a few minutes. The use of road-marking vehicles enables the markings to be made almost without the need to cordon off the moving worksite.

<CLAIMS>
Method of applying horizontal markings to roads 
or other traffic areas, using water-thinnable dispersion 

paints, characterized in that an aqueous, acid-coagulable 
dispersion paint is applied to the road 

surface and is brought into contact with an acid. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an dispersion paint is used which has been 

formulated to the basic and which contains an acid-coagulable 
binder. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the acid in the form of an aqueous solution or 

in an organic solvent, preferably as a from 10 to 30 per 
cent strength solution, is sprayed on to the freshly 

applied dispersion paint. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the dispersion paint is sprayed on to the road 

surface and the acid in the form of an aqueous solution 
or in an organic solvent, preferably as a from 10 to 30 

per cent strength solution, is sprayed into the spray 
mist of the paint. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an acid anhydride is added to the dispersion paint 

and forms, with the water of the aqueous dispersion 
paint, the abovementioned acid. 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 5, characterized 
in that the acid in the form of solid, acid-containing 

or anhydride-containing particles is 
scattered on to the applied dispersion paint. 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 5, characterized 
in that the dispersion paint is sprayed on to 

the road surface and the acid in the form of solid, 
acid-containing or anhydride-containing particles is 

sprayed into the spray mist of the paint. 
Method according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the acid-containing particles are composed of  

 
glass beads which are coated with a thin, adhering layer 

of solid acid or solid acid anhydride. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the acids used are commercially 

available inorganic or organic acids, preferably citric 
acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid. 
Method according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that the acid anhydride used is one of 

the following: anhydrides of inorganic acids, for 
example phosphorus pentoxide in solid form, anhydrides 

of organic acids in solid form, or anhydrides of organic 
acids in liquid form, for example acetic anhydride 

dissolved in an organic solvent or diluted with water. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according 
to Claim 1, having a marking vehicle (1) which is 

provided with one paint spray gun (2) or with two paint 
spray guns (2, 12) arranged one after another, 

characterized in that behind the paint spray gun (2) or 
behind each of the both paint spray guns (2, 12) there 

is installed a nozzle (4, 13) for spraying acid (5) 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, having two 
paint spray guns (2, 12), characterized in that a 

dispenser (10) for profiled particles (11) is installed 
between the first paint spray gun (2) and the first 

nozzle (4), and that a reflective-bead scatterer (6) is 
installed between the second paint spray gun (12) and 

the second nozzle (13).
