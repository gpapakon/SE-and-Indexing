<ABSTRACT>
Process for improving the yield of production of high octane number gasolines after reforming naphtha by introducing a transalkylation step which makes it possible to valorise the heavy and light fractions derived from the reforming step.

<CLAIMS>
Process for improving the yield of high octane fuels, which
comprises the following stages:


a. subjecting a naphtha charge to catalytic reforming by
bringing it into contact with a catalytic reforming

catalyst to form three fractions: one light, one
intermediate and one heavy;
b. separating the three fractions in a separation stage;
c. mixing at least one part of the light fraction with at
least one part of the heavy fraction;
d. subjecting the mixture formed from point c to a
transalkylation stage; and
e. introducing to stage b the waste water from stage d
and recovering a more substantial intermediate

fraction after this stage b,

characterised in that the waste water recovered in the
reforming stage is introduced directly into the separation

stage, and that the whole of the light fraction and the
heavy fraction is introduced to stage d.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
transalkylation stage proceeds in the presence of hydrogen.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that a different source of benzene and/or
polyalkyl benzene is added to stage c. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the transalkylation stage proceeds in
the presence of a transalkylation catalyst chosen from the

large-pore molecular sieves having a stress index of less
than 1.
Process according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
transalkylation catalyst is a mordenite.
