<ABSTRACT>
An integral tool head for a wiring tool (fitting tool) for making contact with a conductor (wire) in a connecting contact without having to strip the insulation comprises a tool axis (X) as well as two limbs (12, 14) which run parallel to the tool axis (X) and each form a plunger. An opening (16) is provided between the limbs, a cutting device for cutting off any excess wire length (77) being provided at a front end of one limb (12). Both front ends of the limbs (12, 14) each have a guide groove (20, 28) for the conductors (76). Both guide grooves (20, 28) are aligned and run at right angles to the tool axis. In this case, the guide groove (28) in one limb is deeper than the guide groove (20) in the other limb (12). The groove base of the guide groove (20) in the limb (12) forms a shear surface (18) with a shear edge (24).

One-piece tool head for a contact. tool for making 
insulation-free contact to a wire (76) in a connector 

contact (74) which is mounted in a housing (72), 
having 


a tool axis (X), 
two legs (12, 14) extending in parallel to the 
tool axis (X), each of which form a pushing tool, 
an opening (16) between the legs, and 
a separating device provided at a front end of a 
leg (12) for separating an excess length of wire 

(77) at an edge (78) of the housing (72), 
characterised
 in that 

at the front ends of both legs (12, 14) a guide 

groove (20, 28) for the wire (76) is provided, 
both guide grooves (20, 28) are aligned and 
extend perpendicularly to the tool axis (X), 
viewed in the direction of the tool axis (X) the 
guide groove (28) of the leg (14) without 

separating device is deeper than the guide groove 
(20) of the leg (12) with the separating device, 
the groove bottom (18, 19) of both guide grooves 
(20, 28) each forming a pushing tool, and 
the'groove bottom of the guide groove (20) of the 
leg (12) with the separating device forming a 

shear surface (18) with a shearing edge (24). 
Tool head according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that
 
viewed in the operating direction (B) the shear 

surface (18) encloses a angle of between 90° and 120° 
to the tool axis (X). 
Tool head according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that
 
the opening (16) is constructed essentially in the  

 
shape of a U. 
Tool head according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that
 
on both sides of the opening (16) recesses (32, 32') 

are provided which accommodate a guide contour of the 
housing (72). 
Tool head according to Claim 4,
characterised
 in that
 
the recesses (32, 32') widen conically from the front 

end of the tool head (10) in the direction of its 
rearward end. 
Tool head according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised
 in that
 
the rearward end of the recesses (32, 32') extends in 

the shape of an arc. 
Tool head according to Claim 4,
characterised
 in that
 
due to the opening (16) and the recesses (32, 32') two 

guide webs (34, 36) are formed parallel to the tool 
axis (X). 
Tool head according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that
 
the front ends (19, 38) of the guide webs (34, 36) 

form pushing tools which mechanically wedge the wire 
(76) in the housing (72). 
Tool head according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that
 
in the case of at least one guide groove (20, 28) the 

edges (26, 30) of the groove walls facing towards the 
opening (16) are bevelled.  

 
Tool head according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that
 
it consists of metal. 
Contact tool consisting of a tool head (10) according 
to one of the preceding claims and of a handle part to 

which the tool head is fastened. 
Contact tool according to Claim 10,
characterised
 in that
 
the handle part consists of plastic. 
Method of making insulation-free contact to a wire 
(76) in a connector contact (74) which is mounted in 

a housing (72), having a contact tool comprising a 
tool head (10),
 
the wire (76) being pushed into the connector contact 

(74) by forward movement of the tool head (10) and in 
so doing being stripped, made contact with and wedged 

in place,
characerised
 in that
 
at the end of the process of making contact the excess 

length of wire (77) is severed at an edge (78) of the 
housing (72) by means of a shearing edge (24) which is 

formed from a shear surface (18) and an inner surface 
(22) of the tool head (10).
