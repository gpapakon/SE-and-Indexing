<ABSTRACT>
An optical multiplexing device spatially disburses collimated light from a fiber optic waveguide into individual wavelength bands, or multiplexes such individual wavelength bands to a common fiber optic waveguide or other destination. The optical multiplexing device has application for dense channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems for fiber optic telecommunications, as well as compact optical instrument design. Multiple wavelength light traveling in a fiber optic waveguide is separated into multiple narrow spectral bands directed to individual fiber optic carriers or detectors. An optical block has an optical port for passing the aforesaid multiple wavelength collimated light, and multiple ports arrayed in spaced relation to each other along a multiport surface of the optical block. A continuous, variable thickness, multicavity interference filter (22) extends on the multiport surface (20) of the optical block over the aforesaid multiple ports. At each of the multiple ports the continuous interference filter transmits a different sub-range of the multiple wavelength collimated light passed by the optical port, and reflects other wavelengths. Multicolor light passed to the optical block from the optical port is directed to a first one of the multiple ports on an opposite surface of the optical block. The wavelength sub-range which is "in-band" of such first one of the multiple ports is transmitted through that port by the local portion of the continuous, variable thickness interference filter (22) there, and all other wavelengths are reflected. The light not transmitted through the first port (16) is reflected to strike a second port, at which a second (different) wavelength band is transmitted and all other light again reflected. The reflected optical signals thus cascades in a "multiple-bounce" sequence down the optical block (10) of the multiplexing device, sequentially removing each channel of the multiplexed signal. In reverse operation, individual channels are combined in the optical block and transmitted through the optical port.

 OPTICAL MULTIPLEXING DEVICE AND METHODRelated ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending United States patent application of Michael A. Scobey, Serial No 08/490,829, filed on June 15, 1995 andentitled Optical Multiplexing Device, and a continuation-in-part of copending UnitedStates patent application of Michael A. Scobey, Serial No. 08/300,741 filed on September2, 1994 and entitled Low Pressure Reactive Magnetron Sputtering Apparatus AndMethod.INTRODUCTIONThe present invention is directed to an optical multiplexing device which spatiallydisburses collimated multi-wavelength light from a fiber optic waveguide into individual wavelength bands, each of which can be directed to an individual fiber optic waveguide output line, light detector, etc., or multiplexes such individual wavelength bands to a common fiber optic waveguide or other destination. In certain preferred embodiments, the improved multiplexing devices of the present invention are particularly well suited for dense channel wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems for fiber optictelecommunications systems.BACKGROUND While fiber optic cable is finding widespread use for data transmission and othertelecommunication applications, the cost of new installed fiber optic cable presents abarrier to increased carrying capacity. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) would 

allow different wavelengths to be carried over a common fiber optic waveguide. Presently preferred wavelength bands for fiber optic transmission media include those centered at 1.3μ and 1.55μ. The latter is especially preferred because of its minimal absoφtion and the commercial availability of erbium doped fiber amplifiers. It has a useful band widthof approximately 10 to 40 nm, depending on application. Wavelength division multiplexing can separate this band width into multiple channels. Ideally, the 1.55μ wavelength band, for example, would be divided into multiple discreet channels, such as 8, 16 or even as many as 32 channels, through a technique referred to as dense channel wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), as a low cost method of substantially increasing long-haul telecommunication capacity over existing fiber optic transmission lines. Wavelength division multiplexing may be used to supply video-on-demand and other existing or planned multimedia, interactive services. Techniques and devices are required, however, for multiplexing the different discreet carrier wavelengths. That is, the individual optic signals must be combined onto a
