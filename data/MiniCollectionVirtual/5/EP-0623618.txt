<ABSTRACT>
A class of pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives, 

substituted at the 3-position by a substituted 
piperazinylmethyl moiety, are antagonists of dopamine 

receptor subtypes within the brain, having a selective 
affinity for the dopamine D
4
 receptor subtype over other 
dopamine receptor subtypes, and are accordingly of 

benefit in the treatment and/or prevention of psychotic 
disorders such as schizophrenia whilst manifesting fewer 

side-effects than those associated with classical 
neuroleptic drugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a 
particular class of heteroaromatic compounds. More 
particularly, the invention is concerned with the use of 
substituted pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives which are 
antagonists of dopamine receptor subtypes within the 
brain and are therefore of benefit in the treatment 
and/or prevention of psychotic disorders such as 
schizophrenia. The "dopamine hypothesis" of schizophrenia 
predicts an increased activity of dopamine 
neurotransmission in the disease. The hypothesis is 
supported by early observations that drugs, such as 
amphetamine, with dopamine agonist or dopamine-releasing 
properties are capable of eliciting a psychosis 
indistinguishable from acute paranoid schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a disorder which is 
conventionally treated with drugs known as neuroleptics. 
In the majority of cases, the symptoms of schizophrenia 
can be treated successfully with so-called "classical" 
neuroleptic agents such as haloperidol. Classical 
neuroleptics generally are antagonists at dopamine D₂ 
receptors. The fact that classical neuroleptic drugs 
have an action on dopamine receptors in the brain thus 
lends credence to the "dopamine hypothesis" of 
schizophrenia. Molecular biological techniques have revealed 
the existence of several subtypes of the dopamine 
receptor. The dopamine D₁ receptor subtype has been 
shown to occur in at least two discrete forms. Two forms 
of the D₂ receptor subtype, and at least one form of the 
D₃ receptor subtype, have also been discovered. More  
 
recently, the D₄ (Van Tol etal., Nature (London), 1991, 
350, 610) and D₅ (Sunahara etal., Nature (London), 1991, 
350, 614) receptor subtypes have been described. Notwithstanding their beneficial antipsychotic 
effects, classical neuroleptic agents such as haloperidol 
are frequently responsible for eliciting acute 
extrapyramidal symptoms and neuroendocrine disturbances. 
These side-effects, which clearly detract from the 
clinical desirability of classical neuroleptics, are 
believed to be attributable to D₂ receptor blockade in 
the striatal region of the brain. It is considered (Van 
Tol etal., supra) that compounds which can interact 
selectively with the dopamine D₄ receptor subtype, whilst 
having a less-pronounced action at the D₂ subtype, might 
be free from, or at any rate less prone to, the side-effects 
associated with classical neuroleptics, whilst at 
the same time maintaining a beneficial level of 
antipsychotic activity. The compounds of use in the present invention,
