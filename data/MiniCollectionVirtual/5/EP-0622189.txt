<ABSTRACT>
Method to produce outwardly lined furniture elements with 
a foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic filler core, the elements 

consisting of an inner filler core (17) outwardly lined with 
a decorative material (18), such elements being employed to 

construct parts of furniture, the method comprising a step 
of production (15) by injection moulding or casting of a 

flat sheet (12) of a foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic 
material of great dimensions, the flat sheet (12) of a 

foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic material undergoing 
shearing and shaping (14) to produce furniture elements of 

the desired size, which thereafter undergo squaring and 
trimming (16) to produce an inner filler core (17), which is 

lined with a decorative material (18) after application of a 
layer of an adhesive of a polyurethane type. 
Decorated element for furniture, which comprises an inner 
filler core (17) consisting of a foamed, semi-foamed or 

synthetic material produced by shearing from a flat sheet 
(12) of a foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic material with a 

density between 15 and 30 kgs. per cu.metre.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method to produce outwardly 
lined furniture elements with a foamed, semi-foamed or 
synthetic filler core and the outwardly lined furniture 
elements with a foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic filler core 
thus produced, as set forth in the respective main claims. To be more exact, the invention concerns a method to 
produce furniture elements the filler core of which consists 
of a suitably shaped foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic 
material outwardly lined with one or more sheets of a 
decorative lining material consisting of a plastic, wooden, 
paper or PVC material or a laminate or thin foil of wood or 
the like. The invention is applied to the furniture industry and 
especially to the production of lined furniture elements 
with a foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic filler core, the 
elements having their front surface smooth or shaped with 
mouldings, cornices, ornaments, etc. The lined furniture elements made with a foamed, semi-foamed 
or synthetic filler core by means of the method 
according to the invention can be employed to produce 
sidewalls, work surfaces or doors of furniture. Shaped and lined furniture elements consisting of a shaped 
body made generally of a wooden agglomerate material and 
lined with one or more decorative sheets of a plastic or 
other material are contained in the state of the art. These shaped and lined furniture elements have been widely 
used although they entail several drawbacks including the 
great weight of their shaped, inner, filler core consisting 
of a wooden agglomerate material and the tendency of the  
 
inner filler core, when in contact with water, to swell and 
become damaged to the extent that the element cannot be 
used. Next, the great weight of the inner filler core made of a 
wooden agglomerate material leads to high production costs 
linked to the handling of the material in the factory and to 
the transport of the assembled furniture. In fact, the vehicles used for haulage of the furniture by 
road can often not be fully filled since they would exceed 
their maximum authorized load, and this fact increases the 
costs of the furniture. Moreover, the plant and machine tools required for the 
processing of the inner filler cores made of a wooden 
agglomerate material are expensive inasmuch as the 
processing of the filler cores requires strong machines and 
tools, and these costs too have a great effect on the 
finished product. Furthermore, the inner filler core of a wooden agglomerate 
material often contains adhesive

employed to construct parts of furniture, the method being 
characterised in that it comprises a step of production (15) 

by injection moulding or casting of a flat sheet (12) of a 
foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic material of great 

dimensions, the flat sheet (12) of a foamed, semi-foamed or 
synthetic material undergoing shearing and shaping (14) to 

produce furniture elements of the desired size, which 
thereafter undergo squaring and trimming (16) to produce an 

inner filler core (17), which is lined with a decorative 
material (18) after application of a layer of an adhesive of 

a polyurethane type. 
Method as in Claim 1, in which the step (19) of applying 
by means of an adhesive the decorative lining (18) is 

carried out on the flat sheet (12) of a foamed, semi-foamed 
or synthetic material upstream of the shearing and shaping 

step (14). 
Method as in Claim 1, in which the step (19) of applying 
by means of an adhesive the decorative lining (18) is 

carried out on the inner filler core (17) leaving the 
shearing and shaping step (14).

in that it comprises an inner filler core (17) consisting of 

a foamed, semi-foamed or synthetic material and produced by 
shearing from a flat sheet (12) of a foamed, semi-foamed or 

synthetic material with a density between 15 and 30 kgs. per 
cu.metre.
