<ABSTRACT>
An electrical contactor device (80) for controlling the flow of 
electrical power from a source of electrical power to an electrical device 

according to a command signal from a controller utilizing a rotary disc assembly 
(90) rotated by an actuator means (169) where the rotary disc assembly (90) 

is comprised of a rotary disc (100) supporting a disc conductor (102) having 
a pair of contact pads (106,108) joined by a pair of conductor legs (109,113) 

and a center section (111) where the conductor legs (109,113) are parallel and 
offset one from the other straddling an axis of rotation (103) where high flow of 

electrical current through the disc conductor (102) generates an electro-magnetic 
torque in the rotary disc assembly (90). The disc contacts (106,108) 

make electrical contact with a corresponding number of stationary contacts 
(110,112) of a "turn back" design one of which is connected one to a source 

of electrical power and the second to the device whose operation is to be 
controlled were as the rotary disc (100) is rotated by the actuator means (169), 

the disc contacts (106,108) make electrical connection with the stationary 

contacts (110,112) and when the actuator means (169) is not energized a 
return spring (176) causes the rotary disc (100) to rotate in an opposite 

direction thereby causing the stationary contacts (110,112) to be forced away 
from the rotary disc (100) by a separation ramp (140,142). A disc conductor 

(102) is formed to induce a rotary torque in the rotary disc (100) when an 
abnormally high electrical current is conducted thereby breaking the conduction 

path by rotating the rotary disc (100) in conjunction with the return spring (176) 
to overcome the spring (180) connecting actuator means (169) and open the 

contactor device (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical contactor such as for controlling the 
flow of electrical power to a device such as a motor. More specifically, this 
invention relates to an electrical contactor for normal electrical power that can 
be initiated or terminated using a pair of electrical contacts with one side of the 
pair mounted to a rotary disc powered by an actuator having a contact 
separation ramp and an arc suppressor and a second side connected to a 
source of electrical power and an electrical device. Various types of electrical contactor systems are well known in the 
art see e.g. DE-C-489 822 and generally function to open or close at least one electrical contact for 
controlling the flow of electrical power from an electrical supply to some type 
of electrical or electro-mechanical device. The purpose of the electrical 
contactor is to allow for either manual or automatic control of the electrical 
device so that its operation can be stopped and started either in normal 
operation or during abnormal operation wherein the supply of electrical current 
is controlled by the action of an electrical contactor which naturally opens and 
terminates flow of electrical power into the device, said electrical contactor being closed by an actuator to 
allow the flow of electrical power through the contactor according to commands 
received from some type of controller such as a microprocessor. Common prior art methods of accomplishing the initiation or 
termination of electrical power flow employ a variety of mechanical mechanisms 
which are commonly spring loaded to force a pair of electrical contacts either 
closed or open to "make" or "break" an electrical circuit wherein the spring  
 
mechanism is specifically designed to yield a force versus time history to 
minimize contact bounce upon closure thereby improving the life of the 
contacting elements. The mechanical mechanism is commonly controlled by 
operation of a manual switch which is moved to an "on" position or to an "off" 
position which causes the electrical contactor to dose or open thereby "making" 
or "breaking" the electrical circuit. Usually the action of the manual switch is 
designed to be abrupt with a somewhat high actuation force required to move 
from the "on" to the "off" position or vice versa. Various types of arc suppression devices are used to provide for 
the dissipation of the electrical energy caused by the arcing between the 
contacts when the electrical contactor is opened or closed. These arc 
suppression devices
