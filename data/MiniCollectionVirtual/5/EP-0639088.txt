<ABSTRACT>
In the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, a CPAP flow generator (22) is employed to direct air to a nasal mask (20) fitted to a patient. The airflow from the generator is monitored, and the flow and/or pressure is increased through signal processor (24) when the waveform of the air flow exhibits characteristics corresponding to flow limitation. The generator may be controlled to repetitively test for waveform variations, in order to adjust the CPAP flow to the minimum level that does not produce flow limitation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for adjusting the
positive airway pressure of a patient to have an optimum (e.g. minimum)
value, in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, according to the preamble of claim 1.Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a well recognized disorder
which may affect as much as 1-5% of the adult population. It is one of the
most common causes of excessive daytime somnolence, and it is the single
most frequent reason for referral to sleep disorder clinics.The syndrome is characterized by the intermittent obstruction of the
upper airway which occurs during sleep. The obstruction results in a spectrum
of respiratory disturbances ranging from the total absence of airflow (apnea)
to significant obstruction with or without reduced airflow (hypopnea and
snoring), despite continued respiratory efforts. The morbidity of the syndrome
arises from hypoxemia, hypercapnia, bradycardia and sleep disruption
associated with the apneas and arousals from sleep. OSAS is most frequent in
obese males, and is associated with all conditions in which there is anatomic
or functional narrowing of the upper airway, as in heavy snoring. The pathophysiology of OSAS is not fully worked out. However, it is
now well recognized that obstruction of the upper airway during sleep is in
part due to the collapsible behavior of the supraglottic segment during the
negative intraluminal pressure generated by inspiratory effort. Thus, the
human upper airway during sleep behaves as a Starling resistor, which is
defined by the property that the flow is limited to a fixed value irrespective of
the driving (inspiratory) pressure. Partial or complete airway collapse can then
occur associated with the loss of airway tone which is characteristic of the
onset of sleep and may be exaggerated in OSAS.Since 1981, continuous positive airway pressure applied by a tight fitting
nasal mask worn during sleep has evolved as the most effective treatment for
this disorder, and is now the standard of care. The availability of this non-invasive
form of therapy has resulted in extensive publicity for apnea and the
appearance of large numbers of patients who previously may have avoided the
medical establishment because of the fear of tracheostomy. Increasing the
comfort of the system, which is partially determined by minimizing the
necessary nasal pressure, has been a major goal of research aimed at
improving patient compliance with therapy. Various systems for the treatment
of obstructive sleep apnea are disclosed, for example, in

<CLAIMS>
Continuous positive airway pressure apparatus for use in the treatment of a patient
airway obstruction, comprising a source of air arranged to direct airflow to a patient and to

establish an initial level of continuous positive airway pressure to the patient, a flow sensor
(23) to sense airflow to the patient, 
characterised
by
 a signal processor (24) which is
connected to the flow sensor for defining an inspiratory waveform contour of the airflow to

the patient, and a controller (25) that is connected to the signal processor, the signal
processor including means for determining the presence or absence of patient airway

obstruction from the inspiratory waveform contour by identifying a deviation therein from
a normal waveform contour, and the controller including means for adjusting the pressure

to the patient in response to the determination by the signal processor of the presence or
absence of upper airway obstruction while maintaining a positive pressure in the patient's

airway.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the controller (25) includes (a) means
for increasing the airway pressure to the patient in response to a determination by the signal

processor (24) of the presence of patient airway obstruction for a predetermined duration,
and (b) means for decreasing the pressure to the patient in response to a determination by

the signal processor of the absence of a patient airway obstruction for a predetermined
duration.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the signal processor (25) includes
means for determining the presence of patient airway obstruction when the inspiratory

waveform contour includes a plateau.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the signal processor (24) includes
means for determining the presence of patient airway obstruction when the inspiratory

waveform contour is flattened. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the signal processor (24) includes
means for determining the presence of patient airway obstruction when the inspiratory

waveform contour deviates from a substantially sinusoidal shape.
