<ABSTRACT>
An adapter assembly (10) is provided for 
interconnecting a pair of opposing optical fiber connectors 

generally along an optical axis (12). The adapter assembly 
is constructed as a double-ended receptacle for receiving 

the connectors in opposite open ends (18, 20) thereof. The 
assembly further includes a pair of halves (14, 16) 

each defining one of the open ends for receiving one of the 
connectors. Each half has an interconnection (22, 32) 

operatively associated with its respective connector. At 
least one latch arm (40) is provided on one of the adapter 

halves, within the peripheral bounds thereof, projecting 
generally parallel to the optical axis (12) toward the 

other adapter half and engageable with a complementary 
latch (42a) on the other half.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
connecting devices and, particularly, to an adapter for
interconnecting a pair of opposing optical fiber connectors
such as SC-type connectors.Optical fibers are used for high speed
communications and data transmissions. Optical fiber
connectors are used on opposing fiber ends to provide means
for readily coupling and uncoupling the fiber ends in a
quick-release fashion. Rather than providing male (plug)
and female (receptacle) connectors as is prevalent in the
electrical connector art, optical fiber connectors often
are interconnected by adapters which not only interconnect
a pair of opposing optical fiber connectors, but the
adapters facilitate aligning the optical fibers to prevent
transmission losses at any given interconnecting interface.One type of optical fiber connector design
commonly is identified as an "ST" connector ("ST" being a
trademark of American Telephone and Telegraph Co.). Such
connectors generally are of a bayonet-type interconnection.
Basically, this type of connection includes a plug-type
coupling having one or more outwardly projecting lugs,
along with a relatively rotatable socket-type coupling
having a spiral or L-shaped slot for respectively receiving
each of the lugs. When an adapter is used, the bayonet-type
plug couplings or connectors are terminated to
opposing optical fiber ends, and the adapter has opposite 
receptacle ends provided with lug-receiving slots for
receiving the opposing optical fiber couplings or
connectors.Another type of optical fiber connector design
commonly is identified as an "SC" connector, first
manufactured by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co. of
Japan. Generally, this type of interconnection is based on
a push-pull concept. Again, plug-type couplings or
connectors are terminated to opposing optical fiber ends.
When an adapter is used, it again is designed as a double-ended
receptacle for receiving the opposing optical fiber
connectors, but in a push-pull fashion. The connectors and
the adapter have complementary interengaging latch means,
such as hooked latch arms for engaging latch bosses, to
interconnect the adapter and the connectors.One of the problems with adapter designs
heretofore available, whether used with ST, SC or other
fiber optic connectors, is that the adapters are fabricated
with two interconnected halves. Each half defines one
receptacle end of the adapter for receiving a respective
one of the opposing optical fiber connectors. Consequently,
some form of means must be provided for

An
 adapter assembly (10) for interconnecting a
pair of opposing optical fiber connectors generally along a

fibre axis (12), the adapter assembly comprising :
a double-ended receptacle for receiving the connectors in

opposite open ends (18, 20) thereof, the receptacle being formed by
a pair of halves (14,16), each half defining

one of said open ends for receiving one of the connectors,
and each half having interconnecting means (22, 32)

operatively associated with its respective connector,

   complementary interengaging latch means (40, 40a, 42a)
between the receptacle halves in the form of at least one latch

arm (40) on one of the receptacle halves projecting generally
parallel to said axis toward the other receptacle half and

engageable with a complementary latch (42a) on the other
half, 
characterized in that
at least one of the receptacle halves includes on an outer peripheral face
a deformable rib (56) parallel to said optical axis and engageable with an inner peripheral

edge of an aperture in a panel (52) and providing the sole means
for mounting the adapter in the aperture in the panel,
wherein said deformable rib (56) has a dove-tailed
configuration to provide acute corners (56b) parallel to said optical axis and which are

readily deformable upon insertion to provide an interference
fit so as to secure the adapter assembly within the panel aperture,
and at least one of the adapter halves includes on an outer peripheral face opposed to the face holding the deformable rib a
tranverse lip (54) for abutting against one side of the panel (52)

to define a mounted position of the adapter assembly (10), as said
panel.
