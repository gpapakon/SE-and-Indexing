<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a communications system for ciphering information for a radio transmission in an access network (ACN), and for carrying out an authentication in at least one core network (CON1, CON2). According to the invention, public keys (PUK1-MT, PUK-BS) are transmitted alternately between a mobile station (MT) and the base station (BS) via a radio interface (AI). The public key (PUK1-MT or PUK-BS) received by the base station (BS) or mobile station (MT) is used for ciphering the information which is to be subsequently transmitted via the radio interface. The enciphered information received by the mobile station or base station can be deciphered using a private key (PRK1-MT, PRK1-BS) allocated to the public key (PUK1-MT, PUK-BS) in the mobile station or the base station (BS). Following the ciphering procedure, the respective core network (CON1, CON2) is authenticated by a mobile radio specific device (SIM) of the mobile station and the subscriber is authenticated by a device (AC, AC') of the core network, using alternately transmitted enciphered information.

public key (PUK1-MT, PUK-BS) in the mobile 
station (MT) or in the base station (BS), and

in which
a subscriber-specific device (SIM) in the
mobile station (MT) carries out the

authentication of the respective core network
(CON1, CON2), and the device (AC, AC') in the

core network (CON1, CON2) carries out the
authentication of the subscriber (S1, S2) on

the basis of encrypted information which is
transmitted in both directions.
Method according to Claim 1, in which

a first public key (PUK1-MT) is first of all
sent from the mobile station (MT) to the base

station (BS), which uses it for encryption of
the information to be sent to the mobile

station (MT),
the base station (BS) sends a public key
(PUK-BS) to the mobile station (MT), which uses

it for encryption of the information to be sent
to the base station (BS), and then,
the mobile station (MT) sends a second public
key (PUK2-MT) to the base station (BS).
Method according to Claim 2, in which

the second public key (PUK2-MT) replaces the first
key (PUK1-MT) sent to the base station (BS).
Method according to Claim 1, in which

first of all, the base station (BS) sends a
first public key (PUK1-BS) to the mobile

station (MT), which uses it for encryption of
the information to be sent to the base station

(BS),
the mobile station (MT) sends a public key
(PUK-MT) to the base station (BS), which uses

it for encryption of the information to be sent
to the mobile station (MT), and then,
the base station (BS) sends a second public key 
(PUK2-BS) to the mobile station (MT).
Method according to Claim 4, in which

the second public key (PUK2-BS) replaces the first
key (PUK1-BS) sent to the base station (BS).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
in which


the mobile station (MT) sends a subscriber
identity (SID) for the subscriber (S1, S2) and

an authentication request (aureq-mt) in
encrypted form to the core network

(CON1, CON2), and the device (AC, AC') in the
core network (CON1, CON2) sends back an

authentication response (aures-co) in encrypted
form,
the mobile station (MT) carries out an
authentication procedure to check the identity

of the core network (CON1, CON2).
Method according to Claim 6, in which

the device (AC, AC') in the core network
(CON1, CON2) sends, in encrypted form, an

authentication request (aureq-co) in addition
to the authentication response (aures-co), and

the mobile station (MT) sends back an
authentication response (aures-mt), in

encrypted form, to the device (AC),

authentication procedure to check the

subscriber identity (SID).
