<ABSTRACT>
In a process for on-line quality control in laser machining by means of electro-optical determination of the near-infrared radiation of the swarf ejected through the ''steam passage'' during laser machining of the material, the size of the cavities (pores, holes) produced in the workpiece is measured. The radiation of the swarf is measured in a wavelength range of 800 nm to approximately 1300 nm, preferably with simultaneous determination of the near-UV radiation of the plasma cloud in a preferred wavelength range of approximately 200 nm to approximately 450 nm. A process for evaluating the near-UV signals is also described.

A method for quality assurance when welding or cutting a 
workpiece with laser energy in a material processing 

operation which produces a plasma cloud (3) during material 
processing operation, comprising the steps of:
 
   detecting ultraviolet light in said plasma cloud 

operation, by a detector in a wavelength of approx. 
200 nm up to approx 450 nm to control the laser beam 

coupling in the workpiece and to monitor predetermined 
limits of process parameters including laser 

output power, beam defocussing, beam quality, feeding 
of shielding gas and working gas as well as 

workpiece structure, claening status of the workpiece 
surface and welding gap width, by means of a UV 

photodetection (18) whose output signal is porcessed,
characterized by
 detecting the quantity of liquid material 
being thrown out of the welding pool (4) produced 

during the the material processing operation by the vapor 
pressure in the hole (6) for detecting the dimensions of 

the hollows having arisen in the hollows by optical-electronic 
means in a wave length from 800 nm to preferably 

1300 nm by at least one additional IR-photodiode (8) 
which converts it into an electric signal and supplying 

it to a processing unit (11,12). 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the electric 
signals of the additonal near-IR-photodiode (18) are 

processed by integrating said signals over a period of 
time which is a multiple of the used mains period. 
The method according to claim 2, characterized by 
supplying the integrated signals to a comparator (28).
