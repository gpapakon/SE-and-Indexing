<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a resin film laminated
metal sheet for can, in which both faces of the metal sheet have

resin film laminated layers, and a surface free energy γs of a
face of the resin film is 10 dyn/cm or more to less than 30 dyn/cm,

the face becoming an inside of can after can-making and being
contacted with stuffed food contents. As the resin film,

applicable is a polypropylene film or a propylene ethylene based
random copolymer film of polypropylene being a main component.

Further, a resin film of polyester being a main component and
containing a wax component of 0.1 to 20% is used in a resin film

to be an inside of can after can-making. The resin film laminated
metal sheet for can according to the invention has excellent

formability and adhesion while can-making and superior
taking-out property of stuffed food contents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin film laminated metal sheet to be mainly used to drums and caps of food stuffed cans, in particular a resin film laminated metal sheet for can, which has excellent formability and adhesion while can-making and superior taking-out property of stuffed food contents.Conventionally, coatings have been carried out on metal sheets such as tin free steel (TFS) or aluminum as blank materials for can to be used to food stuffed cans. The coating technique was involved with many problems of being complicated in a baking procedure, taking much treating time, or exhausting much solvent. Therefore, instead of coating, a lot of methods have been proposed for laminating a thermoplastic resin film to heated metal sheets.The object of these methods is to improve formability and adhesion of resin film laminated metal sheets, mainly ① by applying a resin film having a polar group such as a polyester resin (for example Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 63-236640) or ② by carrying out a treatment such as corona discharge on a surface of resin film so as to increase a surface free energy γs of resin film (for example, Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 5-200961). In particular, Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 5-200961 discloses that the γs of resin film should be specified in a range of 38 to 54 dyn/cm for securing adhesion after forming polyethylene film laminated metal sheets.US 4 864 647 A discloses a precoating for a two-piece can, which comprises a thermosetting coating comprising a resin as a solid content and a solvent, and an internal lubricant. The internal lubricant comprises a modified hydrocarbon wax which imparts lubricity to the precoating film and can thus improve the drawing and ironing (ID) formability and the drawing and redrawing (DRD) formability of the metal sheet.On the other hand, there is a problem that if such a resin film laminated metal sheet is applied to food stuffed cans, when removing fully stuffed food contents from the can, it is difficult to take out them because they are firmly stuck to an inside of the can. This problem weakens consumers' purchasing desires, and a resolution of the problem is seriously important, however up to now no investigation has been ever performed.It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a resin film laminated metal sheet for can, which is excellent in formability and adhesion while can-making and in taking-out property of stuffed food contents.This object can be accomplished by such a resin film laminated metal sheet for
