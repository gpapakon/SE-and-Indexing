<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a tray for the containment of liquid-exuding
foods, such as meat, fish or poultry, and a process for
manufacturing the tray.US-A-3 288 346 teaches a tray comprising a lower, tubular
lamina made from paper or cardboard, and a strip-shaped web
which is arranged on top of the former and made, for example,
from plastic. The bottom of the lower lamina is provided with
moldings. Glue spots, which connect the web with the tubular
lamina, are arranged between the lower lamina and the web
arranged on top of said lower lamina. The glue spots lead to a space of the web from the tubular
lamina. As a result, liquid can flow from one side of the tray
to the other between the glue spots.In packaging for liquid-exuding foods, for instance meat,
poultry, fish or the like, movement of the fluid is to be
avoided. Meat juices flowing back and forth look unappetizing
and can lead to soiling through drainage during unpacking or
when the package is damaged.It is known by the EP-A-0 182 139 to absorb liquid in food
trays by providing an absorbent insert. Said prior art food
tray has two laminae of watertight synthetic material with an
absorbent insert, for instance of paper, in between. The inner
lamina shell or upper lamina facing the food item has openings
that facilitate the passage of the liquid to the absorbent
lamina. The effectiveness of the absorbent lamina depends to a
significant extent on the size of the openings.A fundamental disadvantage of the known tray is the difficulty
of manufacture. Furthermore, the three-laminae tray consists of
two different materials, namely, synthetic foam and paper and 
the waste accumulated during the production of the trays is not
recyclable or is recyclable only at a disproportionately high
expenditure.A tray in accordance with this invention does not require an
additional absorbent insert since the tray itself retains the
liquid. An additional absorbent lamina may be provided,
however, and the effectiveness of the absorbent lamina is
improved in trays in accordance with the present invention.The food tray having an upper and a lower lamina and capillary
openings in the upper lamina in accordance with the invention
may be manufactured in a simple fashion, particularly when a
foamed synthetic material, such as polystyrene, is used.Further in accordance with this invention liquid retaining
cavities are formed in at least one of the laminae by
compressing the synthetic foam material to maximum compression
such that the structure of the synthetic foam is destroyed
</DESCRIPTION>
