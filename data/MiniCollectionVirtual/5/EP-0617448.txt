<ABSTRACT>
The unit may be associated with a switch under load (IS) which can be controlled in two ways according to two overcurrent values, by means of a dual-control articulation (10,16), configured in such a way as to act on the control member (C) of the said switch under load (IS) by means of one or the other of the two triggering members (1A,20), one of which is controlled by the fusible valve (VF) and the other by the electromagnetic coil (22); a time delay (101,120) allows the switch under load (IS) to be opened after the expiry of the melting time of the fusible valve.
