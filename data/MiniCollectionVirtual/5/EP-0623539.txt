<ABSTRACT>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image forming 
apparatus, comprising: a sheet feed mechanism (3) for 

picking up stacked cut sheets (68,69) one at a time from 
a single sheet feed position (P2) and for feeding each 

sheet to an image recording portion; a sheet feed unit 
(10) which is vertically movable relative to the sheet 

feed mechanism (3) and to which a cassette (K) 
containing cut sheets may be attached in a detachable 

manner; a sheet feed table (50) which is vertically 
movable within the sheet feed unit (10) and which 

carries a large number of cut sheets (68); cassette 
presence detection means (114,100a) for detecting the 

presence and absence of a cassette (K) on the sheet feed 
unit (10) and for outputting a signal indicating either 

the presence or the absence of the cassette (K); a 
power switch (116) for starting and stopping the cut 

sheet feeder; and mode establishment means (100b), when 
the power switch (116) is turned on, for establishing a 

cassette feed mode involving the cassette (K) for 
minority sheet feed if the detection signal from the 

cassette presence detection means (114) indicates the 
presence of the cassette (K); and for establishing a 

table feed mode involving the sheet feed table (50) for 
majority sheet feed if the detectio
n signal from the 
cassette presence detection means (114, 100a) indicates 

the absence of the cassette (K).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cut sheet feeder
for use with the image forming apparatus such as a copier
or a printer, the feeder feeding the apparatus with cut
sheets of recording paper. Patent Abstracts of Japan vol 12, no. 432 (M-763) 15
November 1988 and JP-A-63 165 255 discloses a driving
system for an electronic copying system which provides a
structure of a driving system by providing a paper feeding
means which selectively enables both cassette feeding and
manual feeding by the use of one roller, on the paper
feeding opening part of a picture image forming device
body, in an electronic copying machine, etc.US-A-4,108,427 discloses a feeding device which
comprises a plurality of cassettes capable of supporting
thereon copy mediums, a cassette cradle for holding the
cassettes in an operatively associated relationship with
one another, feed means for feeding the copy mediums,
control means for controlling the feed means to
intermittently feed the copy mediums, and means for
selectively displacing the cassette cradle to at least two
positions to selectively locate at least one of the
cassettes at a position where it may be acted on by the
feed means, whereby copy mediums may be fed from one of the
cassettes. The image forming apparatus of the type recited in the preamble
of claim 1 is most often used to
record images on a large number of cut sheets of the same
size which are fed continuously. But occasionally, it is
desired to interrupt the ongoing process of image
printing involving many cut sheets so as to insert image
printing of a different kind typically on a smaller
number of sheets. Some of the conventional cut sheet
feeders for use with the image forming apparatus have
mechanisms that meet the requirements for the on-demand
inserted printing.Such conventional cut sheet feeders have a
plurality of sheet feed mechanisms positioned near the
sheet feed table or sheet cassette assembly, each
mechanism comprising its dedicated pick-up rollers, guide
plates and other related parts. When the operator 
selects a desired sheet type, the corresponding sheet
feed mechanism is activated. The activated mechanism
picks up cut sheets one by one from the applicable sheet
feed table or from the corresponding sheet cassette and
feeds them into position inside the image forming
apparatus.The conventional cut sheet feeder of the
above-mentioned type has as many sheet feed mechanisms as
the number of the sheet feed tables or the sheet
cassettes that are mounted in advance of feed operation.

<CLAIMS>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image
forming apparatus, comprising:


a sheet feed mechanism for picking up stacked cut
sheets one at a time from a single sheet feed position

and for feeding each sheet to an image recording portion;

   characterized by:

a sheet feed unit which is vertically movable
relative to said sheet feed mechanism and to which a

cassette containing cut sheets may be attached in a
detachable manner;
a sheet feed table which is vertically movable
within said sheet feed unit and which carries a large

number of cut sheets;
cassette presence detection means for detecting the
presence and absence of a cassette on said sheet feed

unit and for outputting a signal indicating either the
presence or the absence of said cassette;
a power switch for starting and stopping said cut
sheet feeder; and
mode establishment means, when said power switch is
turned on, for establishing a cassette feed mode

involving said cassette for minority sheet food if the
detection signal from said cassette presence detection

means indicates the presence of said cassette; and for
establishing a table feed mode involving said sheet feed

table for majority sheet feed if the detection signal 
from said cassette presence detection means indicates the

absence of said cassette.
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in claim 1, including: 

mode control means for controlling the up-down
movement of said sheet feed unit and said sheet feed

table relative to said sheet feed mechanism in accordance
with the detection signal from said cassette presence

detection means.
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image
forming apparatus according to claim 2, wherein, with

said power switch turned on and with said mode
establishment means having established the table feed

mode for majority sheet feed, said mode control means
moves vertically at least said sheet feed table to

position it to said sheet feed mechanism for majority
sheet feed operation of the cut sheets.
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image
forming apparatus according to claim 2, wherein, with

said power switch turned on and with said mode
establishment means having established the cassette feed

mode for minority sheet feed, said mode control means
moves vertically at least said sheet feed unit to

position said cassette to said sheet feed mechanism for
minority sheet feed operation of the cut sheets. 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image
forming apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said

cassette presence detection means are composed of a
magnet and a reed switch, said magnet being attached to

said cassette to indicate the size of the cut sheets
contained therein, said reed switch corresponding

locationally to the position of said magnet when attached
to said sheet feed unit and outputting a sheet size

detection signal upon detecting the sheet size indicated
by said magnet of said cassette.
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image
forming apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said

sheet feed unit and said sheet feed table are connected
respectively to two clutches engaged with a motor acting

as a driving source so that said sheet feed unit and said
sheet feed table are vertically moved either singly or in

combination depending on the switching of the clutches.
