<ABSTRACT>
A valve block assembly (1) comprising a valve block (2) and a valve-block cover (5) is proposed which, in order to facilitate assembly and to protect electrical contact pins (25, 26) against bending or damage, is equipped with an intermediate plate (33), which has guide openings (38, 39). The said intermediate plate (33) protectively accommodates the contact pins (25, 26) when the valve block (2) and valve-block cover (5) are in the dismantled state. The intermediate plate (33) is subject to the force of compression springs (34, 35), which are compressed when the valve block (2) and the valve-block cover (5) are brought together for assembly. The contact pins (25, 26) then emerge from the protective intermediate plate (33) and enter the contact sleeves (19, 20) intended for them. Secure electrical connections, convenient to manufacture, are thereby ensured inside the valve block assembly. The valve block assembly (1) is suitable for use in motor vehicle brake pressure modulation devices.

Valve block assembly (1), especially for brake-pressure 
modulating devices, such as anti-lock or traction 

regulating devices, composed of a valve block (2), 
in which at least one electromagnetically actuable 

hydraulic valve (3, 4) with first contact elements (25, 
26) for electrical connection is arranged, and of a 

valve-block cover (5), on which second contact elements 
(19, 20) are arranged in order to be plugged together 

with the first contact elements (25, 26) for electrical 
connection to an electronic switch unit (6), characterized 

in that there is arranged between the valve block 
(2) containing the solenoid valve or solenoid valves (3, 

4) and the valve-block cover (5) an intermediate plate 
(33) which is provided with guide orifices (38, 39) for 

the passage of the first contact elements (25, 26) or of 
the second contact elements (19, 20), in that the intermediate 

plate (33) is guided movably in the direction of 
plugging together of the first and second contact 

elements (25, 26; 19, 20) and is subjected to the force 
of compression springs (34, 35), in that the compression 

springs (34, 35) endeavour to hold the intermediate plate 
(33) in an initial position, in which the first or the 

second contact elements (25, 26; 19, 20) are received in 
a protected manner by the guide orifices (38, 39) of the 

intermediate plate (33), and in that, in the ready-mounted 
position of the valve block (2) and valve-block 

cover (5), the intermediate plate (33) is in a position 
exposing the first or the second contact elements (25, 

26; 19, 20) on at least part of their length.  
 
Valve block assembly according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the intermediate plate (33) is 

guided displaceably by screw shanks (29, 30) of a plurality 
of shoulder screws (27, 28). 
Valve block assembly according to one of Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that, to make it easier to 

premount the intermediate plate (33), the guide orifices 
(38, 39) of the latter are assigned introduction funnels 

(46) for the insertion of contact elements (25, 26) into 
the guide orifices. 
Valve block assembly according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the intermediate plate (33) 

consists of insulating material. 
Valve block assembly according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the first contact elements (25, 26) 

are made essentially pin-like, and the shoulder screws 
(27, 28) are arranged on the valve block (2) receiving 

the solenoid valves (3, 4) and the associated second 
contact elements (19, 20) are arranged on the valve-block 

cover (5). 
Valve block assembly according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the first contact elements (25, 26) 

are made pin-like, and the shoulder screws (27, 28) are 
arranged on the valve-block cover (5) and the associated 

second contact elements (19, 20) are arranged on the 
valve block (2) receiving the solenoid valves (3, 4). 
Valve block assembly according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the second contact elements 

(19, 20) are connected electrically to an electric 
circuit board (8). 
Valve block assembly according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that further electrical components (11, 

12) are connected electrically to the electrical circuit 
board (8).
