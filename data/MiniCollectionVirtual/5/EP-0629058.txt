<ABSTRACT>
An optical wavelength selection control system in an optical 
network includes an optical center node device (300) 

and a plurality of terminal devices each comprised of a 
work station (310 - 313) and an interface (314 - 317). The 

optical center node device includes a control circuit 
(370), a plurality of optical switches (340 - 343) and a 

plurality of tunable wavelength filters (350 - 353). When 
there occurs a collision among the plurality of terminal 

devices wherein a plurality of terminal devices send simultaneously 
optical packets to the same terminal device, the 

control circuit operates to control the optical switches 
and the tunable wavelength filters such that they select 

only one optical packet, based on information relating to, 
for example, a data length to be transferred. The control 

circuit (370) sends out an acknowledgment (ACK) signal to 
the terminal device whose optical packet has been selected. 

To each of the terminal devices whose optical packets have 
not been selected, the control circuit sends out, in addition 

to a not-acknowledgement (NACK) signal, a signal 
indicating a resending time schedule. There are no possibilities 

any more for at least these optical packets to be 
involved in the collision problems, and this ensures an 

enhancement of the throughput of the network system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical wavelength
selection control system using a wavelength division multiaccess
technology in optical networks.The optical networks using optical fibers for transmission
paths are expected to be increasingly widely used
in the future because of such advantages that the optical
fiber offers broad bandwidths allowing to transmit a large
quantity of data and that the optical fiber is free from
any induced noise. A conventional system of such optical
networks has been reported by M. Chen et al under the title
"A Media-Access Protocol for Packet-Switched Wavelength
Division Multiaccess Metropolitan Area Networks" in IEEE-Journal
on Selected Areas in Communications, Vol. 8, No. 6,
August 1990, pages 1048 - 1057.Fig. 1 shows an architecture of the above conventional
optical networks with three work stations (W/S). Electrical
signals from the work stations 100 - 102 are respectively
converted at optical interfaces (IF) 103 - 105 to 
optical packet signals of wavelengths λ1, λ2 and λ3 which
have respectively been fixed in advance, and the converted
optical packet signals are sent out to an optical star
coupler 106. At the optical star coupler 106, the optical
packet signals from the optical interfaces 103 - 105 are
wavelength-multiplexed, and the signals thus wavelength-multiplexed
are sent back to the optical interfaces 103 -
105. At each of the optical interfaces 103 - 105, one
optical packet signal of the predetermined wavelength is
selected from among the optical signals in which the inputted
packet signals with wavelengths λ1, λ2 and λ3 are
wavelength-multiplexed. The optical packet signals thus
selected are converted to electrical signals which are sent
out respectively to the work stations 100 - 102.Fig. 2 shows details of one of the optical interfaces
103 - 105 used in the conventional optical networks shown
in Fig. 1. The electrical packet signal from the work
station concerned is inputted to a control circuit 200.
The control circuit 200 sends a header portion of the
electrical packet signal to a fixed wavelength light source
202 having a fixed wavelength of λc and a data portion to a
fixed wavelength light source 201 having a fixed wavelength
of λi which is unique to each work station. The fixed
wavelength light source 202 transmits an optical header
signal of the wavelength λc to the time slot which is 
unique to the work station, while the fixed wavelength
light source 201 transmits an optical data signal of the
wavelength λi, and these signals are transmitted
