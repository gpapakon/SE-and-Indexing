<ABSTRACT>
Of the type of receivers that performs direct current decoupling 
by capacitor, in order to isolate the input receiver of following 

stages. 
Applicable to digital burst transmission systems in optical fibre 
subscriber loops. 
The receiver comprises a line receiver (1) that converts the 
signal received over a transmission medium into an electrical signal 

(S), a direct current decoupling circuit (C,R1) and a first amplifier 
(A1). 
It is characterised in that it also includes a control circuit (2) 
that measures the DC component at the input node of the first amplifier 

(A1) during the frame instants when no signal is being received, and a 
current generator (I) that supplies this node with a current having a 

value determined by the control circuit (2), in such a way that it 
compensates for the increase in voltage produced on the decoupling 

capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a circuit that restores the variations in
DC level present in the signal received by a bursted data receiver, in
such a way that the increases in this level resulting from the
reception of the data bursts are eliminated.It is of special application in bursted data optical receivers.Optical receivers contain an opto-electrical transducer based
generally on a PINFET and an amplifier that produces at its output an
electrical signal with an amplitude proportional to the optical power
received over an optical fibre.These components generate at their output signals that have a DC
component, in the absence of received optical power, that basically
depends on the PINFET bias current and on the amplifier bias currents
This DC component therefore, is subject to serious drifts that depend
heavily on other uncontrollable factors such as temperature, ageing,
etc.This means that DC coupling between the opto-electical transducer
and the following blocks is not possible unless these drift effects are
allowed for. For this reason it is common practice to insert a direct
current decoupling capacitor at the output of the transducer mentioned
and thereby overcome this inconvenience.The document GB-A-2 162 010 discloses an amplifier including
such a capacitor.Nevertheless, in systems like that described here, there is the
additional drawback that the received bursts have a major low frequency
component, meaning that the time constant of the circuit formed by this
capacitor and the equivalent input resistance of the amplifier must be
high in order to permit the lowest frequencies in the signal to pass.
This situation means that the direct current decoupling capacitor
alters its charge at the end of each burst by an amount that depends
on the amplitude of the high logic level ( hereafter "1"), on the
number of bursts, and on the ratio between the number of bits with
value "1" and with value "0" in each burst.As a result of the foregoing it can happen that the value of the
capacitor charge, after a few frames, is sufficiently large to prevent 
the detector circuit from correctly recovering the burst as the "0"
logic level has shifted for the burst in question by an unknown amount;
this could lead to the setting of an erroneous detection threshold or,
at least, one that is not optimum.As a result the technical problem to be overcome consists in
compensating the variations in the DC component that appear on the
direct current decoupling capacitor in data burst transmission systems.This invention which

BURSTED DATA RECEIVER WITH DC CONTROL which comprises a line
receiver (1) for performing the conversion of data signals received

over a communication medium into signals of an electrical nature (S),
a direct current decoupling circuit (C,R1) and a first amplifier (A1)

to boost the level of the received electrical signal, 
characterised
 in
that it also comprises:


a control circuit (2) for performing the measurement of the DC
component present at the input of the first amplifier (A1) in a cyclic

manner during the frame instants when no signal is being received, and
a current generator (I) that supplies the input node of the
first amplifier (A1) with a current whose value is determined by the

control circuit (2), in such a way that the charge on the capacitor (C)
is altered in the sense of compensating the increase in the DC

component across this capacitor (C) produced as a result of the number
of data bursts received, of the amplitude of the bit with value "1" and

of the ratio between the number of bits of value "1" and of value "0"
in each burst.
RECEIVER according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the
current generator (I) comprises a bipolar PNP transistor (T) to the

base of which is applied a first control signal (Vc1) coming from the
control circuit (2), whose emitter is connected to one extremity of a

second resistor (R2) and whose collector is connected to the input node
of the first amplifier (A1) such that it supplies a direct compensating

current, the other extremity of the second resistor (R2) being
connected to a first reference voltage (V1).
RECEIVER
 according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the
control circuit (2) comprises sample and hold means (3) of its input

signal, these sample and hold means receiving a clock signal coming
from a clock circuit (4) in order to perform the sampling process

during the frame instants when no signal is being received and the
holding process during the rest of the time, and to generate at its

output a second control signal (Vc2) that is applied to a direct
current adapting circuit (5) which, in turn, generates the first

control signal (Vc1), whereby the current supplied by the current 
generator (I) tends to compensate the DC component measured at the

input of the sample and hold means (3).
RECEIVER
 according to claim 3, 
characterised
 in that the
direct current adapting circuit (5) comprises a first inverter

amplifier (R3,R4,A2) that amplifies and inverts the second control
signal (Vc2) coming from the sample and hold means (3), and a second

inverter amplifier (R5,R6,A3) that amplifies and inverts the difference
between the signal coming from the first inverter amplifier (R3,R4,A2)

and a second reference voltage (V2), in order to generate in this way
the first control signal (Vc1).
