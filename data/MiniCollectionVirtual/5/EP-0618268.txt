<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic composition 
based on a polyphenylene ether and a modified polyamide. More in particular, the present invention relates to a 
thermoplastic composition having a good balance of mechanical 
and thermal properties, an improved impact resistance, a high 
fluidity in the molten state and, therefore, a good processability, 
comprising a polyphenylene ether , a modified polyamide 
and, optionally, a further polymeric additive. The polyphenylene ether resins (PPE), also known as 
polyphenylene oxide resins, represent a well known family of 
engineering polymers and are characterized by a good combination 
of thermal, mechanical and dielectrical properties within 
a wide temperature range. They are, moreover, selfextinguishing 
even if they are halogen free and do not produce particularly 
toxic smokes when they are exposed to the flame. This 
combination of properties makes the polyphenylene ether resins 
suitable for use in a wide number of applications by means 
of injection or extrusion molding techniques. In spite of these numerous possible commercial applications 
of the polyphenylene ether resins (PPE), their utilization  
 
is limited due to their poor processability mainly attributable 
to the low fluidity in the molten state which can cause 
some difficulties during the extrusion and injection molding 
operations. A further drawback is that the polyphenylene ether resins 
show a poor solvent resistance after molding and a low 
resiliency (IZOD), thus the use thereof for certain applications 
is further limited. To improve these shortcomings it has been suggested to 
blend the polyphenylene ether resins with other polymers 
which possess said lacking properties. Thus, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,379,792 suggests to 
improve the fluidity of polyphenylene ether resins by adding 
a polyamide . According to the teachings of this patent, however, 
the blends are limited to a maximum polyamide concentration 
of 25% by weight, since higher amounts of polyamide involve 
delamination and a significant decay of the other physical-mechanical 
properties such as the resiliency, owing to the 
poor miscibility of the two polymers. Apart from this teaching, it is known from the literature 
that polyphenylene ether resins and polyamide resins are 
not fully compatible with each other within a wide range of 
proportions and that poor properties and phase separation occur 
when the polyamide concentration is rather high. It is also known from the literature that, for
