<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the electrochemical preparation of organic silicon compounds having at least one SiC-bound organic radical, a solution containing at least one halosilane being subjected to an electrochemical reaction. In this process, an anode containing a noble metal (precious metal) or an alloy comprising one or more noble metals, has a halogen scavenger washing round it.
