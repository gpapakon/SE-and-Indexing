<ABSTRACT>
An intra-luminal expander assembly for use with a catheter 
(2) comprises an expandable tubular expander element (16) having 

openings, for example slots (22), formed in it, and first and second 
fixation portions (18,20) located at or towards its ends (12,24). The 

expander 
element (16) is disposed around a core element (10) which comprises a 

shape memory alloy which has been treated so that, when the 
temperature of the alloy is increased above its A
s
 temperature, 
it displays a shape memory effect and the length of the core 

element (10) decreases. The expander element (16) is attached to the 
core element (10) through the first fixation portion (18) and oriented so 

that, as the core element (10) decreases when its temperature 
increases, the first fixation (18) portion is caused to move 

relative to the second fixation portion (20) in a direction towards 
the second fixation portion (20), and the second fixation portion 

(20) being restrained against movement with the first fixation 
portion (18) so that the length of the expander element (16) decreases 

and its transverse dimension increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an intra-luminal expander assembly.A lumen in a human or animal body, such as a blood vessel or a
urinary tract, can require internal support to ensure proper
flow of fluid in the lumen. For example, a lumen can become at
least partially occluded, and support can be required to
reestablish sufficient internal bore in the lumen for flow of
fluid.Support for a lumen can be provided by implantation of a stent
in the lumen. In many situations, this can allow a patient to
resume normal activities without dependence on medical help, at
least temporarily and in many situations indefinitely.It can also be desirable to provide support in a lumen
temporarily, without necessarily implanting a stent in the
lumen. This can be achieved by means of a catheter which can
be inserted into a lumen, and which has a portion which can be
inflated by means of fluid supplied to the inflatable portion
through a hollow bore of the catheter. This technique is
referred to as "balloon angioplasty" when applied to blood
vessels.In processes in which inflatable catheters are used, the
occlusion and the walls of the lumen are expanded and stretched
by inflation of the catheter. The walls then remain in the
stretched condition so as to remove or at least to reduce the
occlusion, and to establish an increased flow of fluid in the
lumen.Once inflated, the catheter completely blocks the lumen against
flow of liquid. The expansion process must therefore be
carried out quickly, and then the catheter must then be
deflated quickly to reestablish flow of fluid. This is
particularly critical in blood vessels on or near the heart 
which, if deprived of blood flow for even short periods
(sometimes less than 30 seconds) can give rise to the condition
known as "heart attack".US-3557794 discloses a catheter of which a portion is formed as
a plurality of longitudinally extending beams formed from a
resiliently deformable metal such as a spring steel. That
portion of the catheter can be expanded transversely by
contraction of a core actuator wire, to support the wall of a
blood vessel.The present invention provides an expander assembly which
includes a shape memory alloy component, which exhibits a shape
memory effect. Shape memory alloys are discussed in an article
by L McDonald Schetky in the Encyclopedia of Chemical
Technology (edited by Kirk-Othmer), volume 20 pages 726 to 736.
Subject matter disclosed in that document is incorporated in
this specification by this reference to the document. Such
alloys can exist in

<CLAIMS>
An intra-luminal expander assembly which comprises:

(a) a tubular expander element (16) having openings
(22) in it which allow it to be expanded transversely,

and first and second fixation portions (18, 20) located
at or towards opposite ends of the element, and
(b) a core element (10) which extends through the
expander element, the expander element being attached to

the core element through the first fixation portion and
oriented so that, when the length of the core element is

made to decrease, the first fixation portion is caused to
move relative to the second fixation portion in a

direction towards the second fixation portion with the
second fixation portion being restrained against movement

with the first fixation portion, so that the length of
the expander element decreases and its transverse

dimension increases,
characterised
in
that
 the core element (10) comprises a shape
memory alloy which has been treated so that, when the

temperature of the alloy is increased above its A
s
 temperature,
it displays a shape memory effect involving a reduction in the

length of the core element and a consequent increase in the
transverse dimension of the expander element.
An expander assembly as claimed in claim 1, in which the
core element (10) comprises at least two portions, of which one

is formed from a shape memory alloy and displays a shape memory
effect.
An expander assembly as claimed in claim 2, in which
another of the portions of the core element (10) is formed from

a shape memory alloy, which exhibits the properties of 
superelasticity, or pseudoelasticity, or a combination thereof.
An expander assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
3, which includes a sheath (26) which surrounds the core

element (10), to which the second fixation portion (20) of the
expander element (16) is attached so that the sheath and the

expander element are oriented contiguously with respect to one
another along the core element.
An expander assembly as claimed in claim 4, in which the
sheath (26) comprises a helically wound wire.
An expander assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
5, in which the connection to the expander element (16) at at

least one of the fixation portions (18, 20) is made by means of
a ferrule (28).
An expander assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to

material, which is located around the openings (22) in the
expander element (16).
An expander assembly as claimed in claim 6, in which the
openings (22) in the expander element (16) are slots extending

along the element, and the collar (32) is located around the
openings in the expander element so that the slots protrude

from at least one end of the collar.
An expander assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
8, in which the expander element (16) is formed from a metal.
An expander assembly as claimed in claim 8, in which the
expander element (16) is formed from a stainless steel.

expander element (16) is formed from a shape memory alloy. 
An expander assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
