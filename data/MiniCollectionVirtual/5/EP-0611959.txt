<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a wheel-acting force measuring 
device designed to remove the brake torque (torsional 

torque) component mixed in a shearing stress detecting 
device. 
The four sensor segments a, b, c, d in the form of 
strain gauges of the stress detecting sensor are logically 

constructed to form four bridge circuits, the output from 
each bridge circuit being fed into an arithmetic circuit 

for finding the value of 

b/(a+b) - c/(c+d) = A 
 
 (shearing 

strain equivalent) and an arithmetic circuit for finding 
the value of 


b/(a+b) - d/(c+d) = B 
 
 (brake torque component 

equivalent), the outputs from the two arithmetic circuits 
being fed into an arithmetic circuit for finding the 
value 
of 


A - αB = C 
 
 (shearing stress with brake torque component 

removed) so as to remove the brake torque component mixed 
in the shearing stress detecting device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a wheel-acting force measuring device for
measuring forces acting on a wheel, such as a road surface
friction force and a road surface friction coefficient,
which can be used as a component of either an antilock
brake system (ABS) for preventing the locking of wheels on
application of the hard brake to the vehicle or a traction
control system (TCS) for preventing excessive slippage of
wheels during acceleration.The present applicant has previously proposed, in
EP-A-504731
acting force measuring device comprising a hole formed in
or adjacent an axle, a stress detecting sensor, such as a
road surface friction detecting sensor or a road surface
friction coefficient detecting sensor, fixedly embedded in
said hole directly or through a spacing agent such that
said stress detecting sensor is disposed on the stress
center axis, the detection signal from said stress
detecting sensor being processed in a signal processing
circuit composed of a bridge circuit. With the wheel-acting force measuring device described
above, the complicated structure of the axle and vehicle
body sometimes causes the stress detecting sensor and
sensor segment to deviate from the ideal positions on the
stress center axis of the brake torque, resulting in the
brake torque (torsional torque) component, besides the
shearing stress, being mixed in the bridge output of the
signal processing circuit.Therefore, in such case, the correct stresses, such as
the road surface friction force and road surface friction
coefficient, cannot be detected and hence an antilock brake
device or traction control system of high precision cannot
be obtained. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate cross talk
due to brake torque.The present invention has been accomplished with the
above in mind and is intended, to automatical by remove the
brake torque component mixed in the stress detecting sensor
output when stresses in the wheel are to be detected.This object is met by the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims.A device according to the present invention
is a shearing stress detecting device,
comprising a stress detecting sensor having four sensor
segments in the form of strain gauges attached to the front
and back of a thin base sheet, said stress detecting sensor
being installed on the stress center line of or adjacent an 
axle of a vehicle, said stress detecting sensor being
constructed in the form of a bridge circuit whose sensor
segments are adapted to be shiftly connected, the
