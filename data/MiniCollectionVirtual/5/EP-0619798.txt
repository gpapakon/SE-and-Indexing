<ABSTRACT>
An improved bottled water station (10) includes a removable reservoir module (14) for simple drop-in installation into a station housing (16) and to cooperate with station components to provide a selected plurality of water supplies at different temperatures for individual dispensing. The preferred reservoir module (14) comprises a lightweight reservoir (46) of molded plastic of the like having an open upper end (48) for receiving and supporting an inverted water bottle (12), and an internal baffle plate (52) which divides the interior of the reservoir (46) into upper and lower chambers (54 and 56). A fitting (62) on a lower end of the reservoir (46) permits sealed reception of an improved chiller probe (32) into the lower chamber (56), wherein the chiller probe (32) is provided as part of a refrigeration system (28) on the station housing (16). In addition, a fitting (74) on the lower end of the reservoir (46) interconnects water from the upper reservoir chamber (54) with a heated water tank (90) on the station housing (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
improvements in bottled water dispenser stations of
the type adapted to receive and support a water
bottle in an inverted position, and to selectively
dispense water therefrom. More specifically, this
invention relates to an improved bottled water
station having a removable reservoir module designed
for drop-in installation into a station housing in
operative engagement with housing components to
provide separately dispensable water supplies at
different temperature levels.Bottled water dispenser stations are well
known in the art for containing a supply of
relatively purified water in a convenient manner and
location ready for substantially immediate dispensing
and use. Such bottled water stations commonly
include an upwardly open reservoir mounted on a
station housing and adapted to receive and support an
inverted water bottle of typically three to five
gallon capacity. Water within the inverted bottle
flows downwardly into the station reservoir for
selective dispensing therefrom through a faucet valve
on the front of the station housing. Such bottled
water stations are widely used to provide a clean and
safe source of water for drinking and cooking, 
especially in areas wherein the local water supply is
suspected to contained undesired levels of
contaminants.In bottled water stations of the
above-described type, the water bottles are normally
provided in a clean and preferably sterile condition
with an appropriate sealed cap to prevent
contamination of the water contained therein. When
an inverted bottle on a station housing reaches an
empty condition, the empty bottle can be lifted
quickly and easily from the station housing and
replaced by a filled bottle having the sealing cap
removed therefrom. The empty bottle can then be
returned to the bottled water vendor for cleaning and
refilling.Although bottled water stations of this type
utilize a sequence of water bottles which have been
individually sanitized, the water reservoir within
the station housing is not subjected to periodic
cleaning or replacement. In this regard, the housing
reservoir commonly comprises a metal or ceramic tank
mounted within the station housing in association
with a refrigeration system for maintaining water
within the reservoir in a chilled condition. In
other station housing designs, an auxiliary reservoir
is provided in association with suitable heating
elements for providing a heated water supply.
