<ABSTRACT>
A toner for developing an electrostatic 
latent image is constituted by a binder resin, a 

colorant, and an ester compound (a), (b) or (c) shown 
below: (a) a poly-functional ester having a tertiary 

carbon or/and a quaternary carbon and obtained from an 
alcohol compound or carboxylic compound having at 

least two functional groups, (b) a mono-functional 

ester having a tertiary carbon or/and a quaternary 
carbon, or (c) a poly-functional ester of a specific 

structure having a primary or secondary carbon having 
at least two functional groups. The ester compound is 

characterized by a good affinity with the binder 
resin, a high hydrophobicity and a low crystallinity, 

thereby providing a toner which shows good low-temperature 
fixability, anti-offset characteristic, 

color-mixing characteristic and transparency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
developing electrostatic images in image forming
methods, such as electrophotography, and electrostatic
printing, and also a process for production thereof.Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic
processes have been known, as disclosed
in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363; 4,071,361
and others. In these processes, an electric latent
image is formed on a photosensitive member comprising
a photoconductive material by various means, then the
latent image is developed and visualized with a toner,
and the resultant toner image is, after transferred
onto a transfer-receiving material, such as paper, as
desired, fixed by heating, pressing, heating and
pressing, etc., to obtain a copy or a print. The
residual toner remaining on the photosensitive member
without being transferred is removed by various
cleaning methods. The above steps are repeated.A full color image may generally be formed in
the following manner. A photosensitive drum is
uniformly charged by a primary charger, exposed
imagewise to laser light modulated by a magenta image
signal from an original to form an electrostatic 
latent image on the photosensitive drum. The
electrostatic image is then developed with a magenta
developing device containing a magenta toner to form a
magenta toner image on the photosensitive drum, which
toner image is then transferred by a transfer charger
onto a transfer-receiving material conveyed thereto.Separately, the photosensitive drum after the
development and transfer is charge-removed, cleaned by
a cleaning member and again uniformly charged by a
primary charger for a cyan toner image formation in a
similar manner. The cyan toner image is transferred
onto the transfer-receiving material carrying the
magenta toner image. Further, a yellow toner image
formation and transfer, and a black toner image
formation and transfer, are successively performed in
a similar manner. Thus, four-color toner images are
transferred onto the transfer-receiving material. The
transfer-receiving material carrying the four-color
toner images is subjected to fixation under
application of heat and pressure by fixing rollers to
form a full color image.In recent years, an image-forming apparatus
performing an image forming method as described above
not only is used as a business copier for simply
reproducing an original but also has been used as a
printer, typically a laser beam printer, for computer
output and a personal copier for individual users. In addition to such uses as
