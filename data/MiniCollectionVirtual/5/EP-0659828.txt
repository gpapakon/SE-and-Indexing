<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin composition, a 
melt-extruded article, an oriented article and a packaging 
material for foods obtained from these articles and furthermore 
relates to a process for producing such resin compositions. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a resin 
composition comprising a polyvinyl alcohol resin (hereinafter 
abbreviated as "PVA") and specific compounds, and furthermore to 
a melt-extruded article, an oriented article, a film article and 
a food packaging film obtained from this resin composition, which 
have excellent gas permeability selectively. The food packaging industry requires packaging materials for 
various kinds of foods. For example, cheese products such as 
processed cheese, which are a type of fermented foodstuff, have 
been conventionally coated with wax. Also plastic materials have 
been used to improve the appearance and to preserve the edible 
portion. Nowadays, there is a need for packaging materials for 
natural cheese. Natural cheese contains live bacteria to 
allow ripening, and these bacteria generate carbon dioxide 
not only during the ripening step, but throughout the later 
stages such as distribution. 
Accordingly, if an ordinary gas impermeable plastic bag is used  
 
in packaging such cheese, the packaged bag will swell up with 
the generated carbon dioxide and the bag is likely to break. Further 
the quality of the cheese will be deteriorated. On the other hand, since oxygen accelerates the growth of 
molds and oxidizes the fat content of the cheese, packaging 
materials less permeable to oxygen gas have been desired for 
cheese packaging. Packaging materials that are readily permeable to carbon 
dioxide, but less permeable to oxygen, have been desired for 
preserving not only fermented foodstuffs such as cheese and miso, 
but also coffee beans. 
Generally, however, plastic packaging materials having a higher gas 
transmission rate (hereinafter abbreviated as "GTR") to carbon 
dioxide also, almost without exception, have a higher 
GTR to oxygen. Thus a need exists for a packaging material that 
has a low oxygen GTR and a high ratio of carbon dioxide GTR to 
oxygen GTR (hereinafter abbreviated as CO2/O2 GTR ratio). US-A-4,073,733 describes a process for producing a 
water permeable membrane by coagulating polyethylene glycol-containing 
PVA in a liquid phase. The resulting membrane is 
highly permeable to substances of intermediate molecular weight 
such as urea and vitamin B12 in a liquid phase. The products of 
this
