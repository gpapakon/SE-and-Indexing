<ABSTRACT>
A two-dimensional active antenna array, in particular, is proposed having an optical beam-forming network for on-board radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) using x-band. Special shapes of the antenna aperture, use and frequency band are possible. A transmitted signal or local oscillator signal in the microwave frequency band and an alternatively additional digital signal modulate a central electrooptic transducer, using the time-division multiplex method. The optical heterodyne signal of this electrooptical transducer is injected into an optical beam-forming network, is amplified via at least one optical amplifier and is transferred to the individual T/R modules in a corresponding manner via optical dividers. After conversion of the optical signals by means of an optoelectrical transducer, and after phase-weighting and amplitude-weighting of the microwave signals, amplification is carried out followed by emission of the electromagnetic signal by means of aerial elements. Based on this arrangement, a further active antenna array is described which uses the beam-forming network bidirectionally.
