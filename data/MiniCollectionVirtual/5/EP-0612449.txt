<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to packet data transfer in a digital cellular radio system comprising at least one common organization channel for sending pages, connection requests, and channel assignments so as to establish an actual connection on another channel. In the invention the user data is transferred from the mobile stations (MS) to the base station (BTS1-BTS4) interleaved with the connection request messages on at least one random-access-type organization channel in messages which will not result in a normal connection establishment. The mobile station sends a random-access-type packet data transfer request on the random-access-type organization channel. A timing advance corresponding to the distance between the base station and the mobile station is determined on the basis of the request received at the base station. The mobile station then utilizes the timing advance for sending data packets on the random-access-type organization channel in messages longer than said transfer request by timing the transfer of the messages with respect to the operation of the base station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to packet data transfer in
a cellular radio system.Advanced digital cellular systems typically
offer a circuit-switched data channel for data
applications. As is well-known, circuit-switched
connections are very heavy to establish. In addition,
at least one traffic channel of the system capacity
has to be allocated to the circuit-switched connection
until the connection is released. For these reasons,
circuit-switched data connections are suitable mainly
for applications which continuously require a transfer
capacity of one transfer channel of the system for
relatively long periods of time. Allocation of a
circuit-switched channel for the transfer is a typical
example of applications suitable for the system.Many data applications involve a low, randomly
occurring transfer demand and a need to keep the
(virtual) transfer connection open continuously. A
circuit-switched connection is not suitable for such
purposes as the resources of the cellular system are
reserved unreasonably, and the implementation of a
service would therefore become too expensive.Advanced digital cellular systems also comprise
a short message service. A short message may be used
in data services for the transfer of small amounts of
data. In the GSM system, for instance, sending a short
message is similar to a conventional call set-up procedure,
i.e. it is a very heavy signalling event. The
applicability of short messages in the establishment
of economical data connections is therefore limited. There are prior art packet switched radio systems
implemented for data applications. Such systems require
separate network investments for data connections. As
the modern cellular systems as such comprise functions
useful for data applications, it is advantageous to aim
at utilizing these functions in providing economical
data connections.US-A-4472802 teaches measuring a time delay in a
data transmission between a mobile station and a base
station. The delay measurement is transmitted to the
mobile station which adjusts the transmission delay to
ensure that the transmission from the mobile will be
synchronized with the time slot assigned to it.EP-A-0522636 (published 13 November 1993) teaches
synchronizing the time length of transmitted data
packets with the time length of time slots of a common
communication channel. A first request-for-access data
packet is transmitted from a mobile station prior to the
transmission of actual message data packets. A base
station reserves a plurality of time slots for exclusive
use by the
