<ABSTRACT>
A compressor assembly includes a housing, and a rotatable impeller within the housing which includes a hub and blades extending from the hub. A ring circumscribes the leading edge of the blades, and cooperates with a groove in the housing to define a clearance therebetween which is larger than the clearance between the connecting edge of the blades and a corresponding conforming portion of the housing. This permits free flow of gas around the ring to enhance the operating range of the compressor wheel. The ring also stiffens the blades, permitting the thickness of the hub to be reduced, thereby further enhancing the operating range of the compressor wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary compressor. Rotary compressors include a rotatable impeller 
wheel mounted on a rotating shaft. The impeller wheel 
carries several blades, which are mounted on the hub of the 
wheel for rotation within a housing. By rotating the 
impeller wheel, gas, usually atmospheric air, is drawn in 
through an inlet of the housing and discharged through a 
diffuser into a volute passage which circumscribes the 
impeller wheel. The impeller wheel may be rotated, in the 
case of a turbocharger, by a turbine wheel, or may be 
rotated by direct mechanical drive in the case of a blower 
or a supercharger. The air is discharged from the volute to 
provide charge air to the induction manifolds of an internal 
combustion engine upon which the device is used. Such 
compressor wheels, however, are stable only across a 
relatively narrow operating range. Operation of the 
compressor wheel outside of this range, in what is commonly 
referred to as the surge or choke regions, results in 
dangerous instabilities. Accordingly, it is desirable to extend the 
operating range of compressor wheels, while at the same time 
maintaining maximum aerodynamic efficiency. U.S. patent 
4,743,161 discloses one known way to increase the operating 
range of a compressor wheel. The compressor wheel discussed 
in this patent provides ports or openings spaced 
circumferentially around the housing to permit bidirectional 
flow of gas into the region of the compressor wheel between 
the upstream and downstream edges of the compressor blades. The present invention provides a circumferentially 
extending ring which circumscribes the leading edge of the 
compressor blades. The ring stiffens the blades, thereby 
permitting the hub area to be made smaller, thus improving 
choke margin. A slot in the housing circumscribes the ring, 
and defines a clearance between the bottom of the groove or 
slot and the ring which is larger than the clearance between 
the connecting edge portion of the blades and the housing. 
The enlarged clearance permits bidirectional flow of gas  
 
over the ring, thereby providing the range enhancing 
features of the prior art without providing the aerodynamic 
disturbing apertures or openings in the housing wall. These and other features of the present invention 
will become apparent from the following description, with 
reference to the accompanying drawing, in which: 
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view taken through 
the compressor assembly made pursuant to the teachings of 
the present

<CLAIMS>
Compressor assembly comprising a housing (12), an 
impeller (22) rotatably mounted in said housing (12), said impeller (22) 

including a hub (24) rotatable about an axis of rotation and blades (30) 
extending from said hub (24), said blades (30) having a free edge (32), said 

free edge (32) having an inlet edge portion (34), an exit edge portion (36), 
and a connecting edge portion extending between the inlet edge portion 

(34) and the exit edge portion (36), said housing (12) including a 
conforming portion (16) conforming generally to said connecting edge 

portion of said free edge (32) and cooperating with the latter to define a 
first clearance therebetween, characterized in that a ring (40) circumscribes 

said free edge (32) of said blades (30) adjacent the inlet edge portion (34) 
and rotatable with said blades (30) relative to said housing (12), said 

conforming portion (16) extending across said ring (40) to define a flowpatl 
around said ring (40) communicating with said first clearance, said housing 

(12) defining a circumferentially extending groove (42) circumscribing said 
ring (40), said groove (42) cooperating with said ring (40) to define a 

second clearance therebetween, said second clearance being larger than 
said first clearance, said groove (42) and said ring (40) having a length 

extending parallel to the axis of rotation of said hub (24), the length of said 
groove
 (42) being sufficiently greater than said ring (40) to permit gas to 
flow around said ring (40) through said second clearance. 
Compressor assembly as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
groove (42) has a depth projecting radially with respect to said axis of 

rotation, the depth of said groove (42) defining at least a portion of said 
second clearance.
