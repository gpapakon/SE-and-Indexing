<DESCRIPTION>
The invention, for which a patent is 
requested, relates to a series of products which result 
from bakery dough, formulated with mixtures of ingredients 
suitably dosed, which are fermented by microorganisms of 
the fermentation itself. The base product is susceptible 
of being formulated and made in different manners, thus 
obtaining a range of products with their own commun 
identity and different features and quality attributes. 
This new type of bread has features on the basis of being 
a product ready to be eaten as the result of cooking in a 
directly or indirectly heated oven, of a dough obtained by 
a mixture of wheat or rye flour, or a mixture thereof with 
or without addition of flours of other cereals and 
tubercles, drinking water and eatable salt, having or not 
having additions of sugars and of two or more additives 
and technological coadjutants, fermented by the 
microorganisms of the bread fermentation itself, such as 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus plantarum.Furthermore, another feature is the fact of 
being a bread with soft and fine crust, of a typical 
golden-brown colour, with pleasant smell and taste, 
density between 0.15 and 0.45, pH between 4.4 and 5.4, 
activity of water between 0.81 and 0.87 and humidity 
between 24 and 38%, as well as being a product of a very 
high capacity of retention of humidity in comparison with 
ordinary bread (french type), loaf bread (american type) 
and/or the hamburger type bread, usually used in the 
commerce, even though it requires a casing of high gas 
proof and water vapor proof barreir in order to reach its 
extra-ordinary prolonged duration of the same.  Additionally, another feature of this new 
type of bread is the fact of being a long conservation 
bread of more than two years, a period in which it 
maintains its sensorial characteristics, aroma, taste, 
consistency within the limits of a very good acceptability 
(it is always maintained soft) having the following 
microbiological characteristics:

higher than 0ºC, the conventional packaged bread 
experiments alterations of physical nature such as 
moisture migration, changes in the crystalinity of starch, 
etc., microbiological nature such as growing moulds, 
yeasts and bacteria,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1.- Bakery and pastry products with long 
conservation, characterised by being products resulting 

from the cooking of a dough obtained with flour, drinkable 
water, eatable salt, having or not having sugars, and with 

two or more additives and technological coadjutants, which 
is fermented by microorganisms of the bread fermentation 

itself, baked and packaged, thus becoming ready for the 
consumption having the following distinctive identity 

features: 

a) they are conserved at ambient temperatures 
during more than two years, free of microbial 

proliferation and maintaining high acceptability of their 
physico-chemical characteristics. 
b) they are of soft and fine crust, of 
typical golden-brown colour, of sweet and pleasant smell 

and taste, having soft crumb with fair volume, with 
density between 0.15 and 0.45 g/cc, preferably between 

0.26 and 0.30 g/cc, pH between 4.4 and 5.4, preferably 
between 4.7 and 5.0, water activity between 0.81 and 0.87, 

preferably between 0.84 and 0.85, and moisture between 24% 
and 38%, preferably between 27% and 30%. 
c) Their microbiological characteristics meet 
the following specifications: total recount of mesophile 

aerobion less than 10² cfu/g, Enteric-bacteria absence in 
1g, Escherichia coli absence in 1g, Staphilococcus aureus 

absence in 1g, Salmonella absence in 25g, Bacillus cereus 
absence in 1g, Clostridium sulphite reductors less than
