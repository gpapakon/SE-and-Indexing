<ABSTRACT>
A device and method for activating the 
circulation of the lymphatic system in the legs of a 

user (100), is described. The device includes a T-shaped 
support 12 having a main shaft 14 with a cross 

shaft 16 mounted at the proximal end 14B and a base 18 
mounted at the distal end 14A. Coil springs (26, 28) 

are mounted at one end to ends (26A, 28A) of the cross 
shaft or arm and at the other end (26B and 28B) to the 

supporting stirrups (30, 31) for the heel 103A of the 
user in a sitting position. The base is comprised of a 

first crossbar 18A and a second crossbar 18B which can 
be disassembled for shipping and storage. To activate 

the circulation of the lymphatic system, the heels of 
the user are first inserted into the supporting 

stirrups. Next, the user applies a downward force on 
the stirrups with the heels and finally, the user 

releases the downward force on the stirrups. The 
springs are constructed so that the legs of the user are 

moved in a vertically oscillating direction without 
significant exercise of the leg muscles and is 

particularly adapted for users who are unable to 
participate in normal activity due to age, illness or 

accident.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
maintaining muscle activity and activating the lymphatic 
system particularly in a user not able to swim or walk 
due to illness, accident or age. In particular, the 
present invention relates to a device wherein a 
resilient means is connected to a support mechanism at 
one end and a stirrup at the other end. The base of the 
support mechanism is collapsible in order to allow 
compact shipping and storage. A user inserts a heel 
into the stirrup and in response to a brief downward 
force exerted by the heel in the stirrup, the resilient 
means oscillates up and down thereby maintaining muscle 
activity and activating the lymphatic system in the leg, 
without significantly exercising the muscles in the leg. The lymphatic system is a system of vessels 
which closely parallels the blood vascular system. The 
lymphatic system helps maintain the proper fluid balance 
in the tissues and the blood by returning the blood 
protein and tissue fluid leaked from the blood vascular 
system to the blood. As a way to provide cells with 
nutrients, blood proteins seep out of the capillaries of 
the blood vascular system and into the interspacial 
spaces between the cells. Once the blood proteins 
diffuse from the capillaries of the blood vascular 
system into the tissue, the blood proteins are unable to 
be reabsorbed back into the circulatory system through 
the capillaries. The lymphatic system provides a method 
of removing the blood proteins from the spaces between 
the cells and transporting the blood proteins back into 
the circulatory system. The capillaries of the 
lymphatic system absorb the blood proteins from around 
the cells and into the lymphatic system. The blood  
 
proteins are removed through the vessels of the 
lymphatic system wherein the blood proteins are returned 
to the blood vascular system through the blood venous 
system. Unlike the blood vascular system which is 
controlled by the heart, the lymphatic system has no 
separate means to pump the lymph through the lymphatic 
system to the blood venous system. The lymph movement 
depends primarily on external forces such as muscular 
contraction, respiratory movement and gravity. Thus, to 
move the lymph, especially upward through the legs, the 
lymphatic system relies on a series of one way valves 
and compression of the valved lymphatic trunks by the 
surrounding leg muscles. Therefore, in order to keep 
the lymphatic fluid moving through the lymphatic system 
and thus remove blood proteins from
