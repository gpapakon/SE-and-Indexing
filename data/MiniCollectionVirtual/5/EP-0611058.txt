<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a current-controlled oscillator 
topology. More particularly this invention provides a current-controlled 
oscillator (CCO) topology which is suited for application in a monolithic 
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). A current-controlled oscillator is one of the functional 
blocks comprising a voltage controlled oscillator. In the prior art, current-controlled 
oscillators can be based on emitter-coupled multivibrators. The 
emitter-coupled multivibrator oscillates at a frequency which is 
proportional to I/VBE, where VBE is the drop across a clamping diode. In 
known manner, the frequency of the multivibrator is varied by adjusting 
I, and is temperature compensated by making current I a function of 
VBE/Rx, where Rx is a low temperature coefficient external resister. In the 
known emitter-coupled multivibrators, the maximum operation 
frequency is limited by switching losses and by the collector-substrate 
capacitance of the coupled transistors combined with the peak-to-peak 
voltage swing across the base-emitter junctions. Moreover, at high 
operating frequencies these effects worsen the temperature stability of the 
emitter-coupled multivibrator. Lastly, the minimum supply voltage for 
an emitter-coupled multivibrator is determined by the minimum voltage 
across the current sources which is given by VCC - 3 VBE. The present invention addresses these limitations of 
known emitter-coupled multivibrators by providing a topology for a 
current-controlled oscillator which has a higher maximum operating 
frequency, a lower temperature coefficient, and a lower operating supply 
voltage.  In a first aspect, the present invention provides a current-controlled 
oscillator circuit which is suitable for monolithic integration, 
the current controlled oscillator circuit comprising: (a) switching means 
operating to produce an output signal having an adjustable oscillation 
frequency; (b) an output port coupled to said switching means for 
outputting said output signal; (c) frequency control means coupled to said 
switching means for setting the oscillation frequency of said output signal; 
and (d) switching control means coupled to said frequency control means 
and to said switching means, said switching control means including 
differential control means for controlling said switching means. In a second aspect, the present invention provides a 
current-controlled oscillator suitable for use in a phase-locked loop system 
having a phase detector and a loop filter, said
