<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides coolant compositions for topical application to the skin which can provide long-lasting cooling with low or reduced skin sting. The compositions comprise a mixture of specific type of acyclic carboxamide coolant with a specific type of 3-substituted-p-menthane coolant, an aqueous vehicle, and no more than about 30 % C1-C6 monohydric alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to low-stinging coolant compositions 
for application to the skin characterized by containing a multiplicity 
of specific coolant compounds and low or zero levels of 
alcohol solvents. Compositions of various types have incorporated within them 
components which provide cooling sensation to skin. Such compositions 
include perfumes, lotions, shaving cream and gels, post-shaving 
preparations, shampoos, antiperspirants, deodorants, 
anti-acne medicines, first aid ointments, and a variety of other 
skin care and pharmaceutical products that are applied to the 
skin. It is well established that the "cooling" effect of menthol 
is a physiological effect due to the direct action of menthol on 
the nerve endings of the human body responsive for the detection 
of hot or cold and is not due to latent heat of evaporation. It 
is believed that the menthol acts as a direct stimulus on the cold 
receptors at the nerve endings which in turn stimulate the central 
nervous system. Although menthol is well established as a physiological 
coolant, its use and effectiveness is limited in some types of 
compositions by its strong minty odor and its relative volatility, 
particularly for perfumes, colognes, pre- or post-shave lotions, 
etc., where aroma is an important aesthetic attribute. The high 
volatility of menthol limits the period of time which it can 
provide cooling sensation. The high volatility of menthol can 
also result in eye sting for compositions applied to the face or 
in the vicinity of the eyes. The cooling effect of menthol and other related terpene 
alcohols and their derivatives has also been studied and reported 
in Koryo, 95, (1970), pp. 39-43. 2,3-p-menthane diol has also been  
 
reported as having a sharp cooling taste (Beilstein, Handbuch der 
Organischen Cheme, 4th Ed. (1923) Vol. 6, p. 744). Carboxamides have also been disclosed for use as coolants in 
a variety of compositions. Two patents describing such materials 
and compositions are U.S. 4,136,163, 
and U.S. 4,230,688, Ethanol and other volatile alcohols are commonly used in 
topical skin compositions to provide a coolant effect. The 
cooling sensation from volatile alcohols is due primarily to the 
latent heat of evaporation from the skin. After shave and 
pre-shave lotions typically contain high levels of ethanol, since 
it provides a cooling effect and does not interfere with the 
pleasing aroma typically associated with these products. Ethanol 
provides a strong initial cooling sensation, however cooling
