<ABSTRACT>
An improved machine for welding pleats on fabric that employs a plurality 
of toothed wheels (22) to index the fabric one pleat at a time. A pusher (46) 

is positioned between each of a selected pair of adjacent wheels. The pushers 
(46) are sized and configured to be capable of pushing selected pleats from 

the wheels (22) to a proper position between the weld stack and anvil for 
welding. Additionally, the welding stacks are independently pneumatically 

actuated so that each welding stack may apply the proper welding pressure. 
A series of air blowers directs a flow of air under a just-welded pleat 

stripping it from the anvil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ultrasonic 
welding machines and, more specifically, to ultrasonic 
welding machines for forming tabs on pleats of woven and 
nonwoven fabric. It is generally known in the blind industry to 
fold blind fabric into pleats. It is further known that 
certain advantages may be obtained by providing a tab 
along pleats of the fabric. These advantages include 
improved pleat retention, that is the tab allows the 
fabric to retain its shape and prevents the fabric from 
losing its creases and going flat. Also, the cording 
holes and the cords themselves may be located through the 
tab and can thus be "hidden" from view. It is known to 
form this tab by ultrasonic welding. Such tabbed pleats are described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,974,656 to Judkins. Figure 9, which is a prior art 
figure derived from a figure of the Judkins patent, 
depicts such a tabbed pleated shade. Prior art Figure 9, 
which includes reference numerals, shows a section of 
fabric creased so as to form a pleat that extends 
longitudinally along the section of fabric. A weld line  
 
124 is placed along the length of the pleat at some 
distance from the creased edge of the fabric so as to 
form a tab 122 that lies longitudinally along the fabric, 
parallel with the pleat. Window blind lift cords 128 may 
then be placed through holes on the tab of the pleated 
shade. Although welding is the preferred manner of 
forming the pleat tabs, other means such as sewing or 
gluing are also common in the industry. The methods used in the industry for forming 
tabs on pleats have included the use of machines having a 
long, toothed spindle. These spindles index the fabric 
forward pleat by pleat into position to be welded. It is 
also known in the industry to employ machines that have 
two or more thinner spindles rather than one long spindle 
to index the fabric when forming tabs. A known method of forming a tab on the pleat is 
through the use of ultrasonic welding. In ultrasonic 
welding, the overlapping sections of material to be 
welded are placed upon an anvil. The anvil supports the 
material during welding. Located above the material to be welded are the 
stacks. A stack consists of a converter, a booster and a 
horn in series, with the horn facing the material. The 
horn has the function of delivering the energy to the 
material to be welded. The stacks are lowered to apply a 
clamping force on the material between the horn and  
 
anvil, which results in the material between the horn and 
anvil being put under
