<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the filling of the flat can (1) with sliver by a sliver-delivering textile machine, such as, for example, a card or drawframe, the flat can (1) being moved under a stationarily rotating turntable. The object of the invention is appreciably to reduce in relation to the state of the art the outlay required for the movements of the flat can (1) which are necessary for filling a flat can. The process according to the invention for traversing a flat can (1) during the filling operation on a sliver-delivering textile machine is carried out in that the flat can (1) is displaced laterally on the traversing reversal path as a result of the pivoting of the flat can about an axis (AO). In the device according to the invention, the traversing device is equipped with a pivoting device. For this purpose, the pivoting device has a pivoting transmitter and a shaft, about which the flat can is pivoted.
