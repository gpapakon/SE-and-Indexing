<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cores for winding 
webs of deformable material. More, particularly, this 
invention relates to cores which reduce waste in the 
winding of film and paper. Core impressions are a major source of waste 
when winding webs of paper or film. Core impressions are 
distortions in a web at or near the core and are apparent 
after unwinding. The impressions are caused by tape, the 
web itself, dirt particles, foldovers in the web, or any 
other surface irregularities at or near the core. 
Although solutions to these problems have been suggested 
in the prior art, see for example German 
Offenlegungsschrift No. 3,610,557, these solutions are 
not always completely successful. In this reference the 
described solution is to provide the core with a covering 
of elastically or plastically deformable material which 
deforms to accommodate the irregularity so that the first 
turns of a web on the core do not have to deform to 
accommodate the irregularity. However, it has been found that when a web of 
photographic base material is wound on a core such as 
described in Offenlegungsschrift No. 3,610,557, the very 
high pressures progressively created cause the wound web 
to collapse radially inwards. These collapses are known 
as buckling, spoking or starring and cause a greater 
amount of waste than that produced by the problems of 
core impressions. The present invention solves the problems 
caused by core impressions while providing greater 
protection against the tendency for buckling, spoking or 
starring of the wound web.  The present invention is an apparatus for 
winding a web of deformable material. The apparatus 
comprises a central cylindrical core having an outer 
surface, which can be made of cardboard, plastic or 
metal. To the outer surface is attached a microcellular 
polyurethane foam. In a preferred embodiment, the microcellular 
polyurethane foam has an average pore size of 
approximately 100 microns. Figure 1 shows a sectional view of the core of 
the present invention. Figure 2 shows a comparison of average 
impressed footage of core impressions for various 
materials. For a better understanding of the present 
invention together with other objects, advantages and 
capabilities thereof, reference is made to the following 
description and appended claims in connection with the 
above-described drawing. Due to pressures involved in the winding of a 
roll of film or paper, the lap end of the web and the 
tape at the core are impressed into the layers above it 
causing a lap
