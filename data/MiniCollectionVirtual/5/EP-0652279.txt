<ABSTRACT>
A friction-reducing lubricating oil composition and a method for 
reducing the fuel consumption of an internal combustion engine are disclosed. 

The lubricating oil composition comprises (a) a major amount of an oil having 
lubrication viscosity; (b) a minor amount of a friction-modifying, polar and 

surface-active compound; (c) a minor amount of a Group IA alkoli metal 
containing compound and (d) a minor amount of a transition element metal in 

a hydrocarbon-soluble or dispersible compound. The method for reducing 
fuel consumption of a spark-ignited internal combustion engine comprises 

utilizing an embodiment of the lubricating oil composition in the crankcase of 
the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction-reducing lubricating oil compositions 
which provide improved fuel economy and oxidation inhibition in internal 
combustion engines. More particularly, this invention relates to finished 
lubricating oil compositions that contain both a fuel economy additive system 
and an antioxidant component. The fuel economy system comprises: (1) a 
member selected from the group consisting of mono and higher esters of 
polyols, primary amines, primary ether amines, ether diamines, 
polyethoxylated amines and polyethoxylated diamines, ethoxylated ether 
amines, the said amines and diamines containing alkyl and alkylene groups of 
from 2 to about 30 carbon atoms, aliphatic amides and polyethoxylated 
amides containing alkyl and alkylene groups of up to about 30 carbon atoms; 
and (2) a compound Containing a Group IA metal of the Periodic Table 
wherein the Group IA metal is present in the finished lubricating oil in an 
amount of from about 10 ppm (wt) to less than about 1000 ppm (wt). The 
antioxidant component comprises a transition element metal compound that is 
soluble or at least dispersible in hydrocarbons, wherein the metal is a 
transition metal of an atomic number of from 21 to 47 of the Periodic Table of 
Elements. Since the automobile fuel shortage of the 1970's, emphasis has been 
placed on the conversion of energy and fuels. The government of the United 
States of America has enacted Federal Regulations which define gasoline-mileage 
requirements which must be met by the automobile manufactures in 
that the new automobiles must provide a specified minimum gasoline mileage. 
The newer automobiles are smaller in size and lighter in weight, as a result of 
these regulations. Another way to conserve fuel is to use friction-reducing additive 
materials in the lubricating oils employed in crankcases of internal combustion  
 
engines. A reduction in friction in the engine results in a decrease in the 
amount of fuel consumed by that engine. It is known that various lubricating oil additives are capable of reducing 
the amount of fuel that is consumed by an internal combustion engine. For 
example, in United Kingdom Patent Application GB 2,097,813A, it was 
disclosed that certain esters provide reduced fuel consumption. In U.S. Patent 
4,208,293, Zaweski disclosed that a fatty acid amide of diethanolamine, or a 
fatty acid ester of diethanolamine, or a mixture thereof, or esteramides formed 
therefrom can be used as additives in a lubricating oil composition to reduce 
frictio
