<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disposable absorbent
articles, such as female sanitary napkins, adult incontinence
devices, and the like. Still more particularly, the present
invention concerns such disposable absorbent articles having side
flaps and flap adhesive for joining the flaps to the underside of
a wearer's panty.All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for
the absorption of body fluids such as menses, urine, and feces
are, of course, well known. Absorbent articles, particularly
sanitary napkins, having wings or flaps are disclosed in the
literature and are available in the marketplace.Generally, the flaps extend laterally from a central
absorbent means and are intended to be folded around the edges of
the wearer's panties in the crotch region. Thus, the flaps are
disposed between the edges of the wearer's panties in the crotch
region and the wearer's thighs. The flaps serve at least two purposes. First, the flaps
prevent exudates which otherwise would soil the edges of the
wearer's panties from doing such. Second, the flaps help
stabilize the napkin from shifting out of place, especially when
the flaps are affixed to the underside of the panties.Sanitary napkins having flaps of various types are disclosed
in U.S. Patent 4,687,478, entitled "Shaped Sanitary Napkin With
Flaps", which issued to Van Tilburg on August 18, 1987, U.S.
Patent 4,608,047, entitled "Sanitary Napkin Attachment Means",
which issued to Mattingly on August 26, 1986, U.S. Patent
4,589,876, entitled "Sanitary Napkin", which issued to Van Tilburg
on May 20, 1986, U.S. Patent 4,285,343, entitled "Sanitary
Napkin", which issued to McNair on August 25, 1981, U.S. Patent
3,397,697, entitled "Disposable Sanitary Shield For
Undergarments", which issued to Rickard on August 20, 1968, and
U.S. Patent 2,787,271, entitled "Sanitary Napkin", which issued to
Clark on April 2, 1957.Commonly, the flaps are provided with an adhesive attachment
means, or flap adhesive, for affixing the flaps to the underside
of the wearer's panties. The flap adhesive is generally provided
with a release liner to protect the adhesive from dirt, keep the
adhesive from drying out and to keep it from sticking to
extraneous surfaces prior to use. The release liner is peeled
from the flap adhesive to expose the adhesive surface which is
then applied to the underside of the panties to secure the flap in
place. After being peeled from the flap adhesive, the release
liner is discarded. However, this arrangement requires the use of
two hands to remove
