<ABSTRACT>
An optical head device uses a birefringent diffraction 
grating polarizer configured in a reflection type. The 

device includes a polarizing hologram element (216) which 
reflects the light from a light source (210) to a converging 

lens system and diffracts the polarized light returning 
from a recording medium. A total reflection film (203) is 

formed on a surface of a diffraction grating which is 
provided periodically by an ion exchange region and a 

dielectric film on a surface of a crystal plate (200) 
having optically anisotropic characteristics. A polarizing 

beam splitter film (218) formed on a surface of the polarizing 
hologram element has reflectivity and transmissivity 

having dependency on the polarization of the incident 
light. In another form, a polarizing hologram element 

includes a polarizing hologram which has diffractive efficiency 
having dependency on polarization of incident light 

and a polarizing beam splitter film (218) which has reflectivity 
and transmissivity having dependency on the polarization 

of the incident light. The diffracted light is 
received by multi-split photodetectors. The arrangements 

enable to make the optical head device compact, light in 
weight and low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical head
device, and more particularly to a birefringent diffraction
grating polarizer, a polarizing hologram element and a
optical head device using such polarizer or hologram element.The polarizer, especially, the polarizing beam splitter
is an element with which a predetermined polarized
light beam is obtained by causing the light propagation
directions changed in the polarized beams orthogonal to
each other. Conventional examples of the polarizing beam
splitters often used include a Glan-Thompson prism or a
Rochon prism. In one example, the optical path is separated
by utilization of differences in the transmission or
reflection due to the polarization at cemented surfaces of
crystal compounds having large birefringences. In another
example, a dielectric multi-layer film is provided at the
cemented surface of a compound prism type beam splitter 
and, by utilization of differences in the interference in
the dielectric multi-layer film due to the polarization,
the light is caused to be reflected or transmitted. The
drawbacks in such elements are that the size thereof is
large, the productivity thereof is low, and the cost thereof
is high. Also, the polarizer of a bulk type as above
only has polarizing functions so that, when it is used for
an optical disk head device, there are difficulties in
compositely accommodating other functions such as those for
focusing error detection and tracking error detection, and
these are obstacles to the scaling down of the optical head
device.A recently developed polarizer in which the productivity
is high and the composite functions other than the
polarization function are accommodated is a birefringent
diffraction grating polarizer which is disclosed in
JP-A-63-314502.
Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing such birefringent
diffraction grating polarizer. Where a proton exchange
region of benzoic acid is provided on an X-plate or
a Y-plate of a lithium niobate substrate 1 which is a
birefringent crystal, it is noted that, with respect to a
wavelength of, for example, 0.78 Âµm which is generally
used in the optical disk device, the index of refraction
for ordinary light which is polarized parallel to the 
crystal optical axis of the substrate increases by about
0.12 and the index of refraction for ordinary light which
is polarized perpendicular to the optical axis decreases by
about 0.04. Thus, the grating in which the exchange region
2 with the proton and the non-exchange region with the
proton are arranged periodically functions
