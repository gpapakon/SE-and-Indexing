<ABSTRACT>
The assembly has a printed circuit board (1) which is formed as a plastic moulding. Conductor tracks (15), which are formed by stamped grids, are embedded in one or more levels in this printed circuit board. In addition, flat plugs (5, 6) are integrally formed on the stamped grids. The components, especially relays (7, 8), are preferably welded to bent flaps on the conductor tracks (15).

<CLAIMS>
Plug-in assembly having a printed circuit 
board (1) which is formed as a plastic moulding and in 

which conductor tracks (15) formed from at least one lead 
frame (16, 17) are embedded, components (7, 8, 9) which 

are electrically connected by means of the conductor 
tracks (15) being fastened on the printed circuit 

board (1) and blade terminals (5, 6) which are integrally 
formed on the lead frame (16, 17) emerging from the 

printed circuit board (1), characterized in that the 
printed circuit board (1) in one piece forms at least two 

mutually perpendicular printed circuit board planes (2, 
3), in which the lead frame (16, 17) extends, within the 

embedding, likewise over at least two mutually perpendicular 
planes, and in that a horizontal printed circuit 

board plane forms a base (3) for at least one vertical 
printed circuit board plane (2), from the underside of 

which base the blade terminals (5, 6) emerge. 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that two or more conductor track groups, formed as lead 

frames (16, 17), are arranged in parallel planes and are 
encapsulated by a common printed circuit board body (1). 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the lead frames (16, 17) have different material 

thicknesses. 
Assembly according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the lead frames (16, 17) are formed from 

different materials. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the lead frames (16, 17) forming  

 
the conductor tracks (15) are encapsulated on all sides 

by the plastic of the printed circuit board (1), the 
fastening points for the components (7, 8, 9) being cut 

out. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that recesses (22) for the recessed 

accommodation of relatively small components (9) are 
provided in the printed circuit board body. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the printed circuit board (1) has 

perforations (11) for the plug fastening of relatively 
large components, such as relays (7, 8), and in that 

contact tabs (20) of the lead frame are bent out of the 
lead frame plane in the region of the perforations. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the terminals of the components 

(10; 23) are welded to the conductor tracks (15), 
in particular to the contact tabs (20) according to 

Claim 7. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that a cap (4) slipped over the printed 

circuit board forms a closed housing together with the 
base (3).
