<ABSTRACT>
Device for collecting heat energy, in particular solar energy, namely a heat collector, consisting of a frame-like structure, on which a plurality of collector pipes (4) constructed with wing-like collector elements (5) are arranged underneath a cover (11) between a distributing pipe (2) and a collecting pipe (3), the collector pipes (4) being rotatably mounted, with the result that the collector elements (5) are able to track the position of the sun. In this arrangement, the collector elements (5) are situated at such a distance from one another that, even when the sun is at its lowest position, no shading of said collector elements is produced by the adjacently situated collector element (5), the collector elements (5) furthermore are designed on both sides with a heat-absorbing coating, and in the direction of the incoming heat there are provided, under the collector elements (5), reflectors (8), by means of which the heat radiation passing between the collector elements (5) and, accordingly, not absorbed by their front sides is reflected onto their rear sides.

A device for absorbing energy from the sun, i.e. a thermal 
collector, comprising a frame-type mounting, on which there 

are arranged, under a covering (11) between a distributing 
tube (2) and an accumulator tube (3), a plurality of 

collector tubes (4) which are constructed with vane-type 
collector elements (5), the collector tubes (4) being 

rotatably mounted, whereby the collector elements (5) may 
follow the position of the sun, characterised in that the 

collector elements (5) are constructed on both sides with a 
heat-absorbing coating and in that reflectors (8) are 

arranged below the collector elements (5) in the direction of 
the sun's irradiated energy, by which reflectors (8) the 

thermal radiation irradiated between the collector elements 
(5) and not absorbed by the front faces thereof is reflected 

onto the rear faces thereof, and in that the axes of rotation 
of the collector tubes (4) are located above the reflectors 

(8) and are so spaced from each other that, even when the sun 
is in its lowest position, no shadows thereof are cast by a 

reflector component or by a collector element (5) located 
adjacent thereto. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that an 
interspace is located between adjacent collector elements 

(5), which interspace is approximately equal to the width of 
the collector elements (5). 
A device according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the reflectors (8) are concavely curved 

in a manner known per se so that their cross-section is 
approximately in the form of an arc of a circle.  

 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the collector elements (5) comprise a 

plurality of partial surfaces (50), which are positioned at 
an acute angle of from 10° to 45° to the axis of the 

collector tubes (4). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, the front 
of at least one of the collector elements (5) being 

constructed with two photoelectric cells (51, 52), a heat 
sensor further being provided and the outputs of the 

photoelectric cells (51, 52) and of the heat sensor being 
connected to a control circuit with a comparator, 

characterised in that another photoelectric cell (53) is 
arranged on the back of the collector element (5), the output 

of which is also connected to the control circuit. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the mounting is const
ructed at its side 
edges with a channel (12) for a tube through which there 

flows a heat transfer medium or for an electrical heat 
conductor. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that sealing of the bearings of the 

collector tubes (5) with respect to the distributor tubes (2) 
or with respect to the accumulator tube (3) is effected by 

means of a device which is formed by an axially movable 
sealing ring (46) and a washer (47) adjacent thereto, the 

space between the sealing ring (46) and the washer (47) being 
filled with silicone grease, an O-ring (48) preferably being 

arranged axially externally of the sealing ring (46) and the 
sealing washer (47). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that photovoltaic elements (60) are arranged 

on the front faces of the collector elements (5).
