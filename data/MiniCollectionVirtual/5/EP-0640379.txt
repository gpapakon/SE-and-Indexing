<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a highly efficient catalytic pollution control process for 
removing N₂O from gaseous mixtures. The process utilizes catalysts derived from 

anionic clay minerals, which after appropriate heat activation, provide superior 
N₂O decomposition activity. The catalytic process comprises contacting an 

N₂O-containing gaseous mixture with the decomposition catalyst under conditions 
sufficient to convert the N₂O into gaseous nitrogen and gaseous oxygen. The 

process catalysts are derived from anionic clay materials such as the hydrotalcites, 
sjogrenites and pyroaurites.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes a highly efficient pollution control process
for catalytically converting nitrous oxide (N2O) into nitrogen gas and oxygen gas
which utilizes decomposition catalysts derived from anionic clay minerals, which
after appropriate heat activation, provide superior N2O decomposition activity.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is not commonly considered an atmospheric pollutant
and has not been considered a constituent of the gaseous pollutants collectively
referred to as nitrogen oxides (NOx) which have received wide attention as
pollutants harmful to the environment. However, recent studies indicate that N2O
in the Earth's atmosphere may be increasing at a rate of about 0.2% per year and
that this increase appears to be caused by anthropogenic activity.N2O is a major stratospheric source of NO, is believed to be involved in
destroying the ozone layer and is recognized to be a green-house gas. Because
N2O has an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 150 years, researchers are
attempting to identify sources of the pollutant and to limit further production of
the harmful gas. Recent reports such as an article by Thiemens and Trogler,
Science, 251(1991)932 suggest that various industrial processes significantly
contribute to the increased levels of N2O found in the Earth's atmosphere.For example, nitrous oxide is a by-product formed during the manufacture
of monomers used in producing 6,6- and 6,12-nylon. Approximately 1.24 X 109 kg 
of nylon were produced in the United States in 1988, alone. Nylon polymers are
typically formed by subjecting a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine to a condensation
polymerization reaction. The most widely used dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, is
prepared primarily by oxidizing cyclohexane in air to form a cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone
mixture followed by oxidizing such mixture with HNO3 to form
adipic acid and N2O. Thiemens and Trogler calculate that about 1 mol of N2O
per mole of adipic acid is formed as a side product in adipic acid processes.
Assuming that 2.2 x 109 kg of adipic acid are produced globally per year, about 1.5
x 1010 mol yr-1 of N2O by-product or 10% of the annual output of atmospheric
N2O can be attributed to this single process.M. Schiavello and coworkers, (J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1, 71(8),
1642-8) studied various magnesium oxide-iron oxide and magnesium oxide-iron
oxide-lithium oxide systems as N2O decomposition catalysts. While magnesium
oxide-iron oxide samples which were fired in air and which contained MgFe2O4
demonstrated low activity,
