<ABSTRACT>
A curved guiding rail for passenger and freight transport systems has sheet metal plates (3) wedged against each other and arranged in a row on a prestressed cable (2). The intervals are bridged by overlapping teeth (5) so that the guiding rail can be curved as desired before bracing.

A multidimensional curvable guiderail for installations for the
 
   transport of persons and material, which in the flexible state is 

curved to correspond with the requirements and subsequently is fixed in 
its curved shape, 
characterized in that
 
sheetmetal plates (3) are stacked upon a tension cable (2), each of them 

exhibiting a cylindrical part (4) which is centred on a hole (6) drilled 
for the cable and widens slightly conically outwards, adjoining on the 

outside of it radially a transition part (1) curved in an arc, so that 
depending upon the curvature of the guiderail, upon the tension cable (2) 

being tightened the cylindrical part (4) of one plate (3) rests against 
the cylindrical part (4) or respectively the transition part (1) of the 

next plate (8). 
A guiderail as in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
   the surfaces of the cylindrical part (4) and the transition part (1) 

are rough. 
A guiderail as in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
   between the hole drilled for the cable and the cylindrical part (4) 

the sheetmetal plate (3) is made flat. 
A guiderail as in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 
   the transition from the flattened part to the cylindrical part (4) is 

rounded. 
A guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
   the hole (6) drilled for the cable exhibits a protuberance (15). 
A guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
   adjoining the transition part (1) the circumference of the sheetmetal 

plate (3) exhibits wavy teeth (5) which are orientated radially. 
A guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 
   the sheetmetal plates (3) are made essenti
ally rectangular. 
A guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 
   at least one groove (10) is provided at the circumference of the 

sheetmetal plate (3) for receiving means of transport.  
 
A guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 
   at least one more groove (11) is provided at the circumference of the 

sheetmetal plate (3) for fastening the guiderail. 
A guiderail as in Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 
   two grooves (11) lying opposite one another are provided at the 

circumference of the sheetmetal plate (3) for fastening the guiderail. 
A guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 
   at each end of the guiderail is arranged a pressure-plate (12). 
A guiderail as in Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 
   cup springs (13) and a clamping device (14) are arranged at at least 

one end of it. 
A method of mounting a guiderail as in one of the Claims 1 to 12,
 
   
characterized in that
 
the sheetmetal plates (3) arranged in a row on a tension cable (2) are 

first of all slightly prestressed, then for forming a curvature of the 
guiderail the sheetmetal plates (3) are offset at an angle to one another 

and after that the pressure on the sheetmetal plates (3) is increased.
