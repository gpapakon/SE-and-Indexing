<ABSTRACT>
In brush bodies for a rotating brush, for example for a carwash system, the brush bodies being formed from semi-shells (14, 15) which are provided with bristle tufts (12) and have, at both end faces (18, 19), a toothing which is formed from grooves (36-38) and cams (39, 40) and by means of which they are secured against dropping out unintentionally and are joined together securely against rotation, and the semi-shells (14, 15) being arranged in pairs securely against rotation on the axis of rotation (8) of the rotating brush and coaxially therewith, provision is made for two semi-shells (14, 15), forming a cylinder, to be joined together in each case in an articulated manner at their inner edges (16) and to be pivotable relative to each other by a predetermined amount in the opening direction, for a plurality of grooves (36-38) to be provided in the upwardly oriented end faces (18) of the two semi-shells, the side walls of which grooves are formed by circular-cylindrical surfaces with the articulation axis (22) as the mid-axis, and for cams (39, 40) to be provided in the downwardly oriented end faces (19) of the two semi-shells (14, 15), the side walls of which cams are formed by the same circular-cylindrical surfaces as the side walls of the grooves (36-38) in the upper end faces (18) of the two semi-shells (14, 15).

washing installation, wherein the bristle carriers comprise half-shell

portions (14, 15) which form cylinders (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) provided with
arrays of bristles (12, 13) and which each have at their one end a first

end face (18, 46) and at their other end a second end face (19, 47) with
interengageable grooves (36, 37, 38, 53, 54, 55) and projections (41, 42,

43, 58, 59, 60 respectively), wherein by virtue of said grooves and
projections respectively the half-shell portions are prevented from

accidentally falling out and can be non-rotatably connected together and
wherein the half-shell portions (14, 15) are arranged in pairs non-rotatably

on the rotary shaft (8) of the rotary brush and coaxially with
respect thereto, characterised in that each two half-shell portions (14,

15) forming a respective cylinder (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are hingedly connected
to each other at their inner edges (16, 44) and are pivotable relative to

each other by a predetermined amount between an open and a closed
position, that provided in the first end faces (18, 46) of the two half-shell

portions (14, 15) are grooves (36, 37, 38, 53, 54, 55) whose side
walls (71, 72, 76, 79, 82, 83) are formed by surfaces (72', 74, 77, 80,

84, 85) of circular cylinders with the pivot axis (22) as the central
axis, and that provided in the second end faces (19, 47) of the two half-shell

portions (14, 15) are projections (41, 42, 43, 58, 59, 60) whose
side walls (88, 91) are formed by the same surfaces (72', 74, 77, 80, 84,

85) of circular cylinders as the side walls (71, 72, 76, 79, 82, 83) of
the grooves (36, 37, 38, 53, 54, 55) in the first end faces (18, 46) of

the two half-shell portions (14, 15).
A bristle carrier according to claim 1 characterised in that
the two half-shell portions (14, 15) are lockable to each other in the

closed position at their two outer edges (17, 45) and are unlockable.
A bristle carrier according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the hinged connection of the two half-shell

portions (14, 15) to each other is in the form of a rotary hinge which is 
formed from mounting projections (20, 21, 25, 50, 51) arranged in

displaced relationship in respect of height at the inner edges (16, 44) of
the two half-shell portions (14, 15), and corresponding recesses (48, 49, 52)

for receiving the respective oppositely disposed mounting projections (20,
21, 25, 50, 51), wherein the mounting projections (20, 21, 25, 50, 51)
