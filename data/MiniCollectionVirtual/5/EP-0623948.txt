<ABSTRACT>
The title chamber has no elevating device which requires the provision of lubricating oil which is a source of particles causing 
contamination in the chamber. Below a treatment chamber (1) an intermediate chamber (30) is arranged. A supporting stand 

(34) is provided below the boat table (6) for supporting the objects to be processed, which can be loaded into or unloaded from 
the treatment chamber (1) gastightly through the intermediate chamber (30). The supporting stand (34) is mounted on a movable 

member movable vertically by means of a ball screw (13'). A bellows (22) is mounted between the intermediate chamber (30) and 
the movable member (12').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a load 
locked vertical type heat treatment apparatus, and more 
specifically to a load lock chamber provided to a load 
locked vertical vertical type heat treatment apparatus. Fig.3(a) shows a partial cross sectional view of a 
load locked vertical type heat treatment apparatus. As shown 
in Fig.3, the load locked vertical type heat treatment 
apparatus is comprised of a treatment chamber 1 and an 
elevator chamber 11. A reaction tube 2 is provided in the treatment 
chamber 1, and a compartment tube 3 is provided in the 
reaction tube 2. A manifold 4 which is provided with a gas 
inlet 9 for introducing a gas into the treatment chamber 1 
and a gas outlet 10 for exhausting the gas is mounted below 
the treatment chamber 1. A heater is positioned around the 
reaction tube 2 so that the reaction tube 2, objects 7 inside 
the reaction tube and the like can be heated. In the compartment tube 3, objects supporting  
 
boats 5 and a boat table 6 for supporting the boats 5 
placing a plurality of objects 7, such as semiconductor 
wafers 7, in vertical direction with spaces between them are 
provided so that they can be loaded into and unloaded from 
the compartment tube 3 through the manifold 4. A treatment to 
objects 7 is to form a thin film by a chemical vapor 
deposition and is annealing or the like. The elevator chamber 11 is connected below the 
treatment chamber 1 through the manifold 4. The elevator 
chamber 11 is communicated with the treatment chamber 1 
through an opening 11a provided at the top of the elevator 
chamber 11 and an opening 4a (Fig.3b), of which diameter is 
smaller than the opening 11a (Fig.3), of the manifold 4. In 
the elevator chamber 11, untreated objects are placed to the 
objects supporting boats 5, or treated objects removed from 
the boats 5. A sealing flange 8 with an outer diameter larger than 
the opening 4a and an inner diameter smaller than the opening 
11a is mounted on the bottom surface of the boat table 6. The 
sealing flange 8 is contacted to a shoulder formed between 
the opening 4a and the opening 11a to open and close an 
interior space of the treatment chamber 1. By such opening 
and closing, the treatment chamber 1 is completely separated 
from an interior space of the elevator chamber 11.  A movable member 12 is horizontally extended and 
provided below the sealing flange 8, and a hole which is 
threaded is provided about its one end. A feed screw 13 
screwed into the hole is extended upwardly and downwardly 
through
