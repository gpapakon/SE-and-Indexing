<ABSTRACT>
A process and composition for the beneficial utilization of waste materials which contain energetic materials are disclosed. Predetermined quantities of the waste material containing energetic materials are placed in admixture with commercial blasting agents causing the energetic materials to participate in the detonation process thereby utilizing energetic materials which would otherwise enter the waste stream. The waste material, in particulate form, that contains the energetic materials is introduced into the blasting agent when the latter is in a relatively fluid state. The modified blasting agent is suitable for use in the normal manner such as in bulk or packaged form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention relates to a process and
composition for the formulation of blasting agents to
permit the beneficial utilization of waste materials
which contain energetic materials.The present invention comprises a process for
the beneficial utilization of waste materials which
contain a composite solid class 1.3 propellant as an energetic material. A blasting agent is
mixed with a predetermined quantity of the waste
material, which is in particulate form. The mixing
is carried out when the blasting agent is in a
relatively fluid state. The resulting mixture forms
a modified blasting agent which is suitable for use
in blasting activities. The present invention
further includes a modified blasting agent which
comprises a predetermined quantity of a composite solid class 1.3 propellant as an energetic
material in particulate form. The energetic material
is in admixture with a detonating blasting agent.
The predetermined quantity of the energetic material
is such that the ingredients in the energetic
material participate in the detonation process.A substantial portion of today's environmental
waste stream is comprised of energetic materials that
can be utilized as a resource material rather than a 
liability to the environment. At present, landfills,
incineration, open burning, etc. are used to dispose
of a wide variety of materials classified as waste or
hazardous waste. However, a significant portion of
the waste stream is comprised of materials that are
predominantly fuels or oxidizer in nature; or in some
instances, the material has been engineered to
produce a stoichiometric balance of chemical
reactions between the ingredients, such as solid
rocket propellant material. The present invention
provides for the beneficial use of such energetic
materials that would otherwise be destined for
incineration, land fills or other disposal.
Basically this is accomplished by the process of
reducing the size of the energetic materials into
particle form or other suitable form and then
incorporating the energetic materials into commercial
blasting agents and thereby creating a modified
blasting agent.There are numerous known commercial blasting
agent compositions and the methods for their
manufacture and use are well known. In particular
this invention relates to modification of such
blasting materials which are typically in the form of
slurries, watergels and emulsions which have found a
wide variety of uses ranging from coal mining,
explosive stimulation of oil wells, free face rock
blasting, ore mining
