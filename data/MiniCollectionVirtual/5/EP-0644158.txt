<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of a zirconia precursor comprises 
contacting a solution of an acidic zirconium compound with a 

solution of a basic zirconium compound to form a gel. A shapable 
dough may be formed by rendering the zirconia precursor shapable, 

for example by drying the zirconia precursor or combining the 
zirconia precursor with a solid filler. The shapable dough may be 

shaped, for example by extrusion, to form a shaped zirconia 
precursor, which in turn may be dried and calcined to form shaped 

zirconia particles. The shapable dough may be prepared so as to 
comprise a source for a catalytically active component, in which 

case the shaped zirconia particles may be used directly as a 
catalyst. A source of a catalytically active component may be 

deposited on the shaped zirconia particles to yield a finished 
catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
a zirconia precursor, a shapable dough and shaped zirconia
particles, in particular to a zirconia precursor, a shapable dough
and shaped zirconia particles useful in the preparation of a
catalyst or catalyst precursor.Zirconia (zirconium dioxide) finds use as a catalyst or as a
carrier or support material for a catalyst. When being used either
as a catalyst or a catalyst carrier, it is desirable that the
zirconia has a high surface area and that the surface area is stable
at high temperatures. Further, to be suitable for use as a catalyst
or catalyst carrier in many applications, it is also important that
the zirconia product has sufficient strength for the required
application. This is particularly the case when the catalyst
comprises particles of zirconia which have been shaped, for example
by extrusion.Zirconia exists in a number of crystalline forms, dependant
upon the prevailing conditions. Thus, zirconia exists under ambient
conditions of temperature and pressure as a stable, monoclinic
crystalline structure. Under extreme pressures or at higher
temperatures, typically of the order of 450 to 1000 °C, zirconia
exists as a tetragonal crystalline structure. At even higher
temperatures, typically in excess of 1500 °C, a cubic crystalline
phase forms. For a general discussion of the properties of
zirconia, reference is made to Kirk-Othmer "Encyclopaedia of
Chemical Technology", Second Edition, Volume 22, pages 651 to 655.The preparation of zirconia may be achieved by methods well
known in the art. Thus, French patent application publication
No. 2 590 887 (FR-A-2 590 887) discloses the preparation of zirconia
by a method comprising precipitating zirconium hydroxide from a
solution of zirconyl nitrate by the addition of aqueous ammonia
solution, followed by drying and calcining the resulting 
precipitate. Similar methods are disclosed by B.H. Davis et al
"Catalytic Conversion of Alcohols. II. Influence of Preparation and
Pretreatment on the Selectivity of Zirconia", Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod.
Res. Dev., vol. 18, No. 3, 1979, pages 191 to 198, and M.J. Torralvo
et al, "Crystallisation Behaviour of Zirconium Oxide Gels", Journal
of Catalysis 86 (1984), pages 473 to 476. US patent No. 4,822,575
discloses a similar method in which zirconia is prepared by the
calcination of the precipitate formed upon the addition of ammonia
to an aqueous solution of zirconium sulphate.P.D.L. Mercera et al, "Zirconia as a Support for Catalysts:
