<CLAIMS>
A method for the electrolysis of an aqueous 
potassium chloride solution, characterized in that the 

sulphate ions are removed from the aqueous potassium 
chloride solution by precipitation as potassium sulphate 

and/or as potassium sulphate-containing salt mixture 
and/or as potassium sulphate-containing compound, the 

sulphate ions being removed by increasing the hydroxide 
ion and/or carbonate ion concentration or by increasing 

the hydrogen carbonate ion or the hydrogen carbonate and 
carbonate ion concentration. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sulphate ions are removed from the aqueous 

potassium chloride solution by the addition of potassium 
hydroxide and/or potassium carbonate. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sulphate ions are removed from the aqueous 

potassium chloride solution by the addition of potassium 
hydrogen carbonate or a mixture of potassium hydrogen 

carbonate and potassium carbonate. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the precipitation of the potassium 

sulphate and/or potassium sulphate-containing salt 
mixture and/or the potassium sulphate-containing compound 

is assisted by the addition of further additional 
precipitants. 
A method according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the further additional precipitant added is calcium 

chloride.  
 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the precipitation involves the 

addition of potassium sulphate seed crystals. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the temperature of the aqueous 

potassium chloride solution during the precipitation of 
potassium sulphate and/or the potassium sulphate-containing 

salt mixture and/or the potassium sulphate-containing 
compound is above the saturation temperature of potassium 

chloride. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the sulphate ions are removed by 

precipitation as potassium sulphate and/or as potassium 
sulphate-containing salt mixture and/or as potassium 

sulphate-containing compound from the thin brine. 
A method according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the sulphate ions are removed from a branch stream 

of the thin brine. 
A method according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the proportion of the potassium chloride contained 

in the solution to the potassium hydroxide to be added is 
from 8 : 1 to 2 : 1. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the electrolysis of potassium 

chloride is carried out according to the amalgam process 
or diaphragm process or membrane process.
