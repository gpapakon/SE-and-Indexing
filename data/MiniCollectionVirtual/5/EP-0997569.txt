<ABSTRACT>
The mechanical performance acting on the washing located in the drum is determined from the power consumption of the electric motor via a stored characteristic curve specific to the drum. The temporal cycle of the program is designed in such a way that the washing or a predetermined proportion of the washing is consistently subjected to the same presettable mechanical energy.

Programme control for washing machines, which detects the load in a laundry drum
driven by an electric motor and takes said load into account when carrying out a washing

programme,
characterized in that

the load in the drum is determined by measuring the power consumption of the electric
motor driving the laundry drum,
in that
 the mechanical power acting on the laundry in the drum is determined from the
power consumption of the electric motor by way of a stored drum-specific characteristic

curve, and
in that
 the chronological sequence of the washing programme is such that the laundry or
a predetermined amount of laundry is always acted upon, irrespective of the drum load,

with the same, predeterminable mechanical energy.
Programme control according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the power consumption of the electric motor is measured during the washing operation.
Programme control according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the power consumption of the electric motor is measured when the motor runs up to a
predetermined speed or when it maintains a predetermined speed.
Programme control according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that

the power consumption of the electric motor is determined by measuring the motor
current or the motor speed and the electric voltage applied to the motor. 
Programme control according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

the power consumption of the electric motor is determined by means of the power drawn
from the mains supply.
Programme control according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

the power consumption of the electric motor is determined from the power delivered by
the electronics to the motor control.
Programme control according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

a full load in the laundry drum corresponds to a low power consumption and a smaller
load in the drum corresponds to a higher power consumption.
Programme control according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

with low power consumption of the electric motor, i.e. with fully loaded laundry drum
and with relatively low mechanical power acting upon the laundry, the washing

programme is of longer duration and/or the duration of operation of the reversing cycles
is greater.
Programme control according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

with higher power consumption of the electric motor, i.e. with only a partial load in the
laundry drum and with relatively high mechanical power acting upon said laundry, the

washing programme is of shorter duration and/or the duration of operation of the
reversing cycles is less.
Programme control according to one of Claims 1, 8 or 9,
characterized in that
 
the duration of the washing programme is selected so that the mechanical energy

determined by integrating the mechanical power acting on the laundry over the entire
washing operation and transferred as a whole to the laundry reaches a value necessary for

a satisfactory washing result.
Programme control according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

when a higher power consumption by the electric motor is detected, indicating a smaller
load in the laundry drum and thus a higher mechanical power acting on the laundry, the

power draw of the electric motor is reduced
Programme control according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

the quantity of water used is adjusted to the load in the laundry drum, by continuing to
supply water, after a minimum level of the water has been exceeded, until the power

needed for driving the drum reaches a predetermined value.
Programme control according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

the quantity of detergent used is adjusted to the load in the laundry drum 
in that
, with the
provision of automatic dosing means for the detergent, less detergent is added when there

is a partial load in said drum.
Method of washing laundry in a laundry drum, which is driven by an electric motor and
in which the laundry is conveyed upwards against the force of gravity before dropping

down again,
characterized in that

the measured electric power consumption of the driving motor serves as measurement for
the mechanical energy acting upon the laundry in the drum, and 
in that
 this washing
operation is ended when the energy sum as the time integral of the mechanical energy

input, measured as electric power consumption, has reached a value which is preset
depending on how heavily the laundry drum is actually filled with laundry, the measure

of this filling of the drum being the power consumption of the motor during the first
washing cycle.
