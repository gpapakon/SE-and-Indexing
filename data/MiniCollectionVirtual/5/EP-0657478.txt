<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is particularly useful in preparing a water soluble 
polymer dispersion. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the 

dispersion is prepared by polymerizing a water soluble mixture of from about 15 
to about 30% percent by weight of a cationic monomer represented by the 

following general formula (I): 

where R₁ is either hydrogen or CH₃; R₂ and R₃ are each an alkyl group having 1 
to 3 carbon atoms; A₁ is either an oxygen atom or NH; B₁ is either an alkylene 

group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms or a hydroxypropylene group, and X₁
⊖
 is an 
anionic counterion, and/or a second cationic monomer represented by the 

following general formula (II): 

where R₄ is either hydrogen or CH₃; R₅ and R₆ are each an alkyl group having 1 
to 2 carbon atoms; R₇ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon 

atoms; A₂ is either an oxygen atom or NH; B₂ is either an alkylene group having 2  
 

to 4 carbon atoms or a hydroxypropylene group and X₂
⊖
 is an anionic counterion; 
and (meth)acrylamide in an aqueous solution of from 17 to about 19 percent by 

weight of a polyvalent anionic salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the novel process for the production of a 
dispersion of a water soluble polymer. Conventional processes for the preparation of a water soluble cationic 
polymer useful as a flocculant include polymerization in an aqueous solution, 
water-in-oil emulsion polymerization, and suspension polymerization in a 
hydrophobic solvent. U.S. Patent No. 4,929,655 (Takeda et al.), which issued on 
May 29, 1990, and which is incorporated herein by reference, provided a novel 
process for preparing a water soluble polymer dispersion which overcomes the 
many disadvantages of the stationary polymerization, water-in-oil type emulsion 
polymerization and suspension polymerization processes. This process for the 
production of a water soluble dispersion includes the polymerization of water 
soluble monomers of 5 to 100 mole % of a cationic monomer represented by the 
following formula (I), 0 to 50 mole % of another cationic monomer represented 
by the following formula (II) and 0 to 95 mole % (meth)acrylamide in the 
presence of 1 to 10% by weight of an organic high molecular multivalent cation 
comprising a water soluble polymer containing at least a monomer of formula (II) 
(i.e., a hydrophilic monomer), based on the total weight of the monomers, in an 
aqueous multivalent anionic salt solution having a concentration of 15% by weight 
or more:  where R₁ is either hydrogen or CH₃; R₂ and R₃ are each an alkyl group 
having 1 to 
3 carbon atoms; A₁ is either an oxygen atom or NH; B₁ is either an alkylene 
group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms or a hydroxypropylene group, and X₁⊖ is an 
anionic counterion, and/or a second cationic monomer represented by the 
following general formula (II): 
where R₄ is either hydrogen or CH₃; R₅ and R₆ are each an alkyl group having 1 
to 2 carbon atoms; R₇ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon 
atoms; A₂ is either an oxygen atom or NH; B₂ is either an alkylene group having 2 
to 4 carbon atoms or a hydroxypropylene group and X₂⊖ is an anionic counterion. U.S. Patent No. 5,006,590 (Takeda et al.), which issued on April 9, 1991, 
and which is Incorporated herein by reference, is similar to Takeda '655, except 
that polymerization is carried out in the presence of both: (1) a water soluble 
cationic polymer which is insoluble in an aqueous solution of a polyvalent anionic 
salt (seed polymer); and (2) a water soluble cationic polymer which is soluble in 
an aqueous solution of a polyvalent anionic salt (dispersant polymer). The water
