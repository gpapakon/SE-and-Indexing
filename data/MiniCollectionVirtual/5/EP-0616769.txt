<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an illuminator for an 
aquarium tank for raising tropical fish etc. and comprising 
a tank body and a lid member mounted on the tank body. An aquarium tank good in appearance and having a filter 
device, an illuminator, etc. which are easy to mount is disclosed 
in U. K. Patent No. 2,239,402, for example. The prior art 
aquarium tank comprises a tank body and a lid member mounted 
on the tank body. The tank body comprises a main frame made 
of synthetic resin or the like and open on the front, portions 
of the opposite sides and top, and a transparent frame made 
of glass, synthetic resin or the like, having a U-shaped 
sectional profile and mounted in the main frame so that the 
open front and side portions of the main frame are closed 
watertightly. The lid member is made of synthetic resin in 
the form of a shallow dish, has an openable and closable front 
lid for use in feeding tropical fish etc. and a rear casing 
in which an illuminator etc. are stored, and is provided on 
the back surface thereof with a receptacle for a heater etc. 
The illuminator for the prior art aquarium tank is provided 
with a transparent cover in order to protect the light source 
(fluorescent lamps) from waterdrops. Since the transparent 
cover is fastened with screws to the illuminator framework, 
the tasks of wiping up adhering waterdrops from and cleaning 
the transparent cover have been carried out, with the transparent 
cover left as it is. These tasks are very troublesome. When 
the fluorescent lamps have to be cleaned or replaced, for  
 
example, it is necessary to loosen the screws and detach the 
transparent cover from the illuminator framework. Thus, the 
prior art illuminator poses a serious problem of workability. The present invention has been proposed to solve the 
problems mentioned above and has as its main object to provide 
an illuminator for an aquarium tank enabling ready attachment 
and detachment of a light source protecting. According to the present invention there is provided an 
illuminator for an aquarium tank comprising a tank body and a 
lid member mounted on the tank body for accommodating the 
illuminator therein, said illuminator comprising a base plate, 
a light source attached to said base plate and a translucent 
cover for covering said light source and protecting it from 
water drops and having a side surface, characterised in that 
said cover is provided on its side surface with a plurality of 
fastened members, which are substantially rectangular in

An illuminator (10) for an aquarium tank (1) 
comprising a tank body (2) and a lid member (4) 

mounted on the tank body for accommodating the 
illuminator therein, said illuminator (10) comprising 

a base plate (32), a light source (22) attached to 
said base plate and a translucent cover (23) for 

covering said light source and protecting it from 
water drops and having a side surface (23a),
 
   characterised in that said cover (23) is provided 

on its side surface (23a) with a plurality of fastened 
members (24), which are substantially rectangular in 

shape and each have opposite side surfaces (24a) 
substantially in parallel and a bottom surface (24b) 

inclined slightly toward said side surface (23a) and 
in that a plurality of resilient fastening members 

(25) are provided on said base plate for detachably 
engaging with said fastened members (24), said 

fastening members (25) corresponding in number to the 
fastened members (24) and each having beams formed by 

bending a thin metal rod into a clip (26) comprising a 
pair of arm portions (28), which, in the normal state, 

expand slightly outward and which have hooks (27) 
projecting away from each other, a pair of fastening 

portions (29), a pair of connecting portions (30) bent 
outward and each connecting the arm portion (28) and 

the fastening portion (29), and an operating portion 
(31) which connects the fastening portions (29), 

whereby said clip (26) is attached to the base plate 
(32) by flexing the arm portions (28) inward, passing 

the hooks (27) of the inwardly flexed arm portions 
(28) through corresponding engaging holes (33) in the 

base plate (32) and depriving the arm portions (28) of  
 

the flexion, thereby allowing the arm portions (28) to 
restore to their original positions to bring the hooks 

(27) into engagement with the edges of the engaging 
holes (33), all parts being arranged such that the 

translucent cover (23) can be easily attached to the 
base plate (32) by swinging the clips (26) outward, 

positioning the translucent cover (23) under the base 
plate and pushing the clips (26) inward to cause 

engagement between the fastening portions (29) of the 
clips (26) and the slightly inclined bottom surfaces 

(24b) of the fastened members (24).
