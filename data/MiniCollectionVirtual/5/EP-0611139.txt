<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a tape cassette having a 
front lid for protecting a magnetic surface of a magnetic 

tape accommodated in a casing made of upper and lower half 
members against dust or the like and a rear lid for 

protecting the back surface of the magnetic tape. The front 
lid 7 is rotatably supported at sides of the casing. The 

rear lid is rotatably suspended on a connecting lever which 
is rotatably supported on the front lid. The magnetic tape 

is protected between the front and rear lids in a lid closed 
state. A pair of pins provided on the rear lid is snugly 

fitted in a pair of guide grooves formed in projections 
provided in the lower half member so that the rear lid may 

move in opening and closing directions. The guide grooves 
have open tops so that the pins of the rear lid are easily 

inserted into the guide grooves in the assembly process. The 
open tops are covered with front rims provided on the upper 

half member in the assembly process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette for use
with a magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus.
Particularly, the present invention
relates to a tape cassette having front and rear lids for
protecting a loaded magnetic tape against dust and having
its rear lid suspended from the front lid by means of a
connecting lever.A tape cassette to be used with a magnetic recording
and/or reproducing apparatus such as a video tape recorder
is exemplified by a VHS standard tape cassette having a tape
width of 1/2 inch, or by an 8mm tape cassette having a tape
width of 8 mm, as is well known in the prior art.Fig. 1(A) is a perspective view of the VHS standard tape
cassette, and Fig. 1(B) is a side view for explaining a lid
opening action of the VHS standard tape cassette.A VHS tape cassette 100, as shown in Figs. 1(A) and
1(B), is assembled from an upper half member 101 and a lower
half member 102 into a box-shaped casing. This VHS standard 
tape cassette 100 is used to perform recording and/or
reproducing operations by not-shown magnetic recording
and/or reproducing apparatuses. For these operations, the
VHS standard tape cassette 100 has its external size and
shape generally standardized to keep interchangeability with
the apparatus.Moreover, a magnetic tape T is made to move between a
supply reel 103 and a take-up reel 104, which are disposed
in the VHS standard tape cassette 100. The magnetic tape T
wound on the supply reel 103 is guided around a supply side
guide pole 105 and along a front lid 106 disposed at
openings 102a of the lower half member 102 and is guided
around a take-up side guide pole 107 so as to be taken-up on
the take-up reel 104.The openings 102a of the lower half member 102 is opened
at its bottom for permitting tape loading members (not-shown)
of the apparatus.On the other hand, the front lid 106 is provided for
protecting the magnetic face of the magnetic tape T against
dust and finger-prints or the like. This front lid 106 is so
supported at the right-hand and left-hand sides of the tape
cassette 100 that it can be opened or closed on a pair of
pins 106a (although only one is shown) integrated
with the inner side of the right-hand and left-hand sides
of the front lid 106. However, the front lid 106 is retained
and closed by a front lid lock member 108 disposed at the
left-hand side of the tape cassette 100.Referring to Fig. 1(B), only when the VHS standard tape 
cassette 100 is inserted into the (not-shown) magnetic
recording and/or reproducing apparatus, the front lid
