 STABILIZED HIGH EFFICIENCY RADIO FREQUENCY AMPLIFIERBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to radio frequency ampli¬ fiers and, more particularly to high efficiency radio frequency amplifiers which are stabilized against undesired oscillation.Description of the Prior Art A conventional unstabilized radio frequency amplifier is shown in FIG. 1. Such amplifier includes a radio frequency amplifier transistor 10 and associated inductor-capacitor input and output matching circuitry coupled thereto as clearly seen in the drawing and readily recognized by those skilled in the art. A power supply, voltage VDQ is pro¬ vided to the collector of an amplifier transistor 10 via an inductor 20. The conventional unstabilized amplifier of FIG. 1 is capable of operating at an overall efficiency of approximately 80% when the input and output thereof are properly matched. However, if a mismatch is presented to the input cr 

o put of such amplifier, it will often become unstable and undesirably commence oscillation. One cause of such oscillation is the undesired feedback of signals from the output of the amplifier to the input of the amplifier. In summary, the amplifier of FIG. 1 is a very efficient but potentially unstable amplifier.FIG. 2 shows a radio frequency amplifier substan¬ tially similar to the amplifier of FIG. 1 except for the inclusion of a stabilization circuit 30 (shown within the dashed lines) coupled to amplifier tran¬ sistor 10 in the manner discussed subsequently. Stabilization circuit 30 includes a resistor 32 and a capacitor 34 coupled together in series to form a resistor-capacitor circuit which is coupled in parallel with the collector and the base of amplifier transistor 10. Stabilization circuit 30 further includes a resistor 36 coupled in parallel with the base and emitter of amplifier transistor 10. By providing the radio frequency amplifier of FIG. 2 with stabilization circuit 30, undesired feedback signals from the output (collector) of the amplifier transistor 10 to the input (base) of transistor 10 are dampened out. Thus, the undesired feedback signals which tend to cause such amplifier to oscil¬ late are attenuated resulting in a stabilized radio frequency amplifier.Unfortunately, although stabilization circuit 30 prevents oscillation, it does so in a relatively inefficient manner. More specifically, relatively large voltage swings of up to 40 volts, for example, across the aforementioned resistor 32 in stabili¬ zation circuit 30 may consume power in excess of one (1) watt.
