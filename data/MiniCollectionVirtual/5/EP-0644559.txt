<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an accumulator (10) of a strander for the alternate-twist stranding (cabling) of at least one stranding element (1), such as wires, single strands or conductors, bundles of wires or cables, which may or may not be twisted, and optical fibres, into a cable (5) of the "SZ" type. This accumulator consists of a packet of flexible guide tubes (11) through the inside of which the stranding elements pass, each upstream end of which tubes is fixed in one of the holes of a stationary distributing part (12) and each downstream end of which tubes is fixed in the corresponding hole of a rotary twisting part (13). This rotary part is connected to means (16) for rotating it alternately in one rotational direction and then in the other, thus forcing the guide tubes (11) to twist. These tubes are held together over substantially their entire length by a retaining strip or other flexible longitudinal element (15) wound helically around the assembly of tubes over substantially their entire length.

Accumulator (10) of a strander for the 
alternate twisting of at least one cabling element (1), such as 

wires, strands or conductors, woven or non-woven bundles of 
wires or cables, or optical fibers, into an alternately wound 

("S-Z") cable (5), this accumulator being made up of a 
plurality of flexible guide tubes (11) inside which the cabling 

elements pass, these tubes having an upstream end fixed in one 
of the orifices of a stationary distribution element (12) and a 

downstream end fixed in a corresponding orifice of a rotary 
twisting element (13) connected to means (16) for rotating it 

alternately in one direction of rotation then the other, hence 
imparting to the guide tubes (11) a tortional movement, these 

tubes being held along substantially their entire length by 
support means, characterized in that the support means comprise 

as least one flexible longitudinal retaining element (15) wound 
about the assembly of tubes over substantially their entire 

length in helicoidal fashion. 
Accumulator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the pitch of the helicoidal winding of the longitudinal 

retaining element is at most equal to the pitch of the tube 
when it is subjected to maximum winding, preferably between 3 

and 15 times less. 
Accumulator according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the longitudinal retaining element (15) 

is a band. 
Accumulator according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the longitudinal retaining element (15) 

is a wire or cable. 
Accumulator according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that the holding means comprise a plurality of 

parallel longitudinal retaining elements (15) helicoidally 
wound in the same direction. 
Accumulator according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the support means comprise a plurality of  

 
parallel longitudinal retaining elements (15) helicoidally 

wound in two opposite directions. 
Accumulator according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that each longitudinal retaining element is 

made of continuous (i.e. full) or woven material having a 
minimum longitudinal elasticity of 2%. 
Accumulator according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that the guide tubes (11) have different 

diameters, for example three continuous central tubes having a 
first diameter and distributed at the corners of an equilateral 

triangle, with three complementary peripheral tubes of a second 
diameter and each contiguous to the first tubes taken two-by-two. 
Accumulator according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that the assembly of tubes is reinforced by 

one or more cables fixed between the distribution element (12) 
and the rotary element (13) parallel to its tubes, and arranged 

in the space between the guide tubes (11). 
Accumulator according to any preceding claim, 
followed by a cable-compacting member (30), characterized in 

that : the assembly of tubes comprises at least three 
contiguous tubes arranged regularly around the central axis of 

the accumulator, leaving therebetween a central space that is 
not used for guiding a cabling element; and in that it 

comprises, between the rotary twisting element (13) and the 
compacting means (30), means guiding one of the cabling 

elements (1) onto the central axis of the compacting member 
(30) such that said element becomes the core of the cable (5). 
Accumulator according to claim 10, 
characterized in that the means (20) for guiding the cable core 

comprise an elbow-shaped tube (21) in extension of one of the 
tubes (11) of the accumulator (10) and which is fixed upstream 

of one of the orifices of the rotary twisting element (13) and 
downstream of the center of an intermediate rotary distribution 

plate (22).
