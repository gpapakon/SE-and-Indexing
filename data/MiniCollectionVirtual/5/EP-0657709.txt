<ABSTRACT>
To fire pipes, pressed isostatically or statically from a mechanically granulated ceramic mass, the pipe is advanced by a roller with a rotary drive, and with a smaller dia. than the inner dia. of the pipe, for the pipe to rotate with the roller. The rotating unit extends into the kiln through a side slit, to be held in place for the duration of the firing. Also claimed is an assembly with a moving base frame (6) for a roller (2) with a motor (7) drive. The frame (6) has a side wall section (15) for the firing chamber (12) with the roller (2) passing through, and a seal (21) all round, for the wall section (15) to plug the opening (17) in the wall of the firing chamber (12).

A method of firing pipes compacted isostatically or statically from a
ceramic mass produced by mechanical build-up granulation in which

the pipe to be fired is pushed laterally onto a rotating driven roller
mounted at least on one side on a base frame and having a diameter

smaller than the inner diameter of the pipe, the pipe being included in
the rotation of the roller, characterized in that the base frame, on the

side of which a wall section penetrated by the rotating roller is
defined, the wall section being stepped tapered inwardly in the

direction of the firing chamber, is run into the firing kiln, after the pipe
has been pushed into place, until the wall section with its steps is in

contact with the corresponding wall cutout of the firing kiln and that
the pipe is held alternatingly rotating in the firing kiln until the firing

process is concluded.
The method as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that the
rotating unit is passed through the full length of the firing kiln.
The method as set forth in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
pipes are pushed onto the rollers directly after pressing without any

further intermediate drying and are run through the firing kiln
rotatingly.
A device for implementing the method as set forth in any of the
claims 1 to 3 comprising a base frame (4;6;30) in which at least one

motor(7)-powered rotating roller (2) is mounted at least on one side,
the base frame (6;30) carrying on the side a wall section (15;32) of

the firing chamber (12) penetrated by the roller (2) with a rotating seal
(21;37), characterized in that the base frame (4;6;30) can be travelled

and the wall section (15;32) together with the roller (2) and the pipe
(1) pushed into place thereon can be introduced into the corresponding

side wall opening (17;26) of the firing chamber (12).
The device as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that the roller (2)
is cantilever-mounted at one end outside of the firing chamber (12). 
The device as set forth in claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the free
end of the roller (2) is counter-mounted within the firing chamber (12).
The device as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that the direction
of rotation of the roller (2) can be periodically reversed.
The device as set forth in any of the claims 4 to 7, characterized in
that several rotatively driven rollers (2) are arranged on the base frame

(6;30) juxtaposed in one row.
The device as set forth in claim 8, characterized in that several
rows of rotatively driven rollers (2) are arranged on the base frame

(6;30) one above the other.
The device as set forth in any of the preceding claims 4 to 9,
characterized in that the base frame (6) comprises a travelling side

chassis (9)with wheels (11), which is located near to the floor and
extending parallel to the rollers (2) and can be travelled in rails (10)

transversely to and laterally underneath the firing chamber (12),
whereby the rotating rollers (2) can be run into the firing chamber (12)

with the pipes (1) pushed into place laterally up to closure of the wall
section (15) in the provided wall opening (17).
The device as set forth in claim 10, characterized in that the
wall section (15) carried by the base frame (6) is tapered stepped (16)

inwardly in the direction of the firing chamber (12).
The device as set forth in claim 10 or 11, characterized in
that the circumferential seal (20,21,22) between wall section (15) and

wall opening (17) consists of sealing webs (20, 21) running parallel to
and along the rim of the wall section (15) and protruding vertically

from the wall opening (17), the sealing webs (20, 21) being covered
and sealed by a spring-loaded sealing strip (22).
The device as set forth in any of the preceding claims 4 to 9,
characterized in that for continous thruput operation the base frame 

(30) can be travelled parallel to the firing chamber (12) and carries a

wall section (32) which is guided along a side, slot-shaped wall
opening (26) running full length in the wall of the firing chamber (12)

and sealed off from the edges of the wall opening (26).
The device as set forth in claim 13, characterized in that
several base frames (30) fitted with pipes (1) to be fired are guided

shoulder-to-shoulder in sequence along the wall opening (26).
The device as set forth in claim 13, characterized in that each
base frame (30) is guided via rollers (31) in at least one rail (38)

running parallel to the firing chamber (12).
The device as set forth in claim 13, characterized in that the
travelling wall section (32) is provided top and bottom with a step (39)

each parallel to the other.
The device as set forth in claim 15, characterized in that the
seal between the travelling wall section (32) and the full-length side

wall opening (26) comprises a sealing webs (35, 36) running along the
top and bottom edge of the wall section (32) and of the wall opening

(26) on the outer side thereof and protruding vertically therefrom, the
sealing webs (35, 36) being slidingly covered by full-length, spring-loaded

sealing strips (37).
