<ABSTRACT>
An implantable measurement probe, preferably an ultrasonic probe, for measuring the flow velocity of the blood in natural blood vessels or replacement blood vessels of human beings and animals. The measurement probe is equipped with a rod-shaped probe head (2, 8) which is arranged at the end of a probe lead and in which a sensor, preferably a piezo crystal, is inserted, and with a device for retaining the probe head on the blood vessel (7). The emission and reception surface (4, 10) of the sensor has an elongated shape, and its longitudinal extension is at least as large as the internal diameter of the blood vessel (7) in which the measurement is to be carried out. This surface (4, 10) extends with its longitudinal extension essentially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rod-shaped probe head. Furthermore, this surface is oriented toward the retaining device (5, 6) such that it extends with its longitudinal extension approximately perpendicularly to the flow direction of the blood in the vessel when the probe head (2, 8) is fastened on the vessel.
