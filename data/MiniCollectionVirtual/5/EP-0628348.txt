<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a regulating device for the entry section of a vertical pulveriser for optimised pulveriser utilisation and for reducing dust in vertical pulverisers. In order to prevent unnecessary air from being drawn in by the vertical pulveriser and leading to the development of dust, the entry opening 2 of the pulveriser is always closed by material located in the receiving container 1, and therefore no unnecessary air is drawn in by the pulveriser and therefore does not lead to the development of dust.

<CLAIMS>
A vertical crusher comprising a means for controlling the intake (2) into the crusher
chamber (3) of the same, a rotor (4) rotatable about a vertical axis and throwing laterally the

material introduced for disintegration, and an intake (2) running into the crusher housing
centrally to the rotor axis into the crusher chamber above the crusher and capable of being

controlled in size by at least one locking element (10, 10', 10''), said rotor being provided
with internally arranged channels (14) extending outwardly for accelerating against a

rebounding wall the material to be crushed, characterized in that the intake (2) is connected
with a funnel-shaped collecting tank and that the locking element is controllable by a probe

(11) controlling the size of the opening of the locking element (10, 10', 10'') as a function of
the amount of material present in the collecting tank (1).
