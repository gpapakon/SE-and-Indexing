<ABSTRACT>
A folder for web-fed rotary presses has longitudinal folding units, cross-folding devices and a cylindrical part. The object of the invention is to allow both flat stitched and cross-glued products to be obtained. For that purpose, a reception unit for interchangeable cross-glueing devices and flat stitching devices is arranged below the longitudinal folding units and above the cylindrical part.

A folding unit for a web-fed rotary printing machine, having 
a device for supplying longitudinally folded and/or not 

longitudinally folded part paper webs, having at least one device 
for transversely connecting paper web strips to form a paper web 

strand and having a transverse folding mechanism, characterized 
in that there is arranged, between a device (3, 8; 4, 9) for 

supplying longitudinally folded and/or not longitudinally folded 
part paper webs and a transverse folding mechanism (5), an 

operating station (13; 39; 40, 41, 42, 27, 37, 36, 29, 31, 17, 
36, 32, 29, 31) for selectively taking up and operating rapidly 

exchangeable transverse gluing devices (14; 38) and strand 
transverse stapling devices (16; 37) of a modular construction, 

and in that the operating station (13) has a plurality of 
coupling devices (39 to 42) for connecting the transverse gluing 

devices (14; 38) and the strand transverse stapling devices (16; 
37) to a main drive. 
A folding unit according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the coupling devices (39 to 42) are connected to a gear train of 

a drive for the transverse folding device (5). 
A folding unit according to Claims 1 to 2, characterized in 
that the coupling devices (39 to 42) are constructed as quick-acting 

couplings. 
A folding unit according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the operating station (13) has a parking surface (51), 

mounted on the outside thereof, for the transverse gluing devices 
and strand transverse stapling devices (14; 38 and 16; 37). 
A folding unit according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that toothed rails (59; 61) fixed to the operating and parking 

surfaces are provided for extending the transverse gluing devices 
and strand transverse stapling devices (14; 16; 37; 38) onto the 

parking surface (51), and in that a toothing of the toothed rail  
 

(59; 61) is in engagement with drivable toothed gears (62; 63) 
mounted in the transverse gluing devices and strand transverse 

stapling devices (14, 16; 37; 38). 
A folding unit according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that a travelling crane (57) having a load-lifting device (58) 

is arranged above the parking surface (51) on supports (52 to 55) 
fixed to the folding unit.
