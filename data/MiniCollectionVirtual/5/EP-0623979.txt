<ABSTRACT>
A laser oscillator 
capable of emitting circularly 

polarized light by a 
simple external optical system. 

The folded part of its 
folded resonator (10) comprises 

reflecting mirrors 
(4a), (4b), and (4c). The reflecting 

mirror (4a) is inclined 
at an angle of 45° to 

the optical axis of an exciting 
unit (3a). The reflecting 

mirror (4b) is arranged horizontally, 
and is positioned 

at the vertex of right angle 
of a rectangular equilateral 

triangle at the other vertices 
of which the reflecting 

mirrors (4a), and (4c) are 
placed. By the arrangement, 

the S polarization 
component of the laser 

light from the exciting unit 
(3b) is reflected toward the 

reflection mirror (4b) by the reflecting mirror (4c). Further, the P polarization component is reflected by the reflecting mirror (4b). 
The S polarization component is reflected by the reflection mirror (4a). From the folded resonator (10), a laser beam having a linearly 

polarized component indicated by arrows (11) is output. Therefore, outside the folded resonator (10), a circularly polarized 
laser beam can be obtained easily only by use of a 1/4 wave-length mirror.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser 
oscillator in which a laser beam is emitted from a 
folded-type resonator, and in particular, to a laser 
oscillator which is capable of simply providing a circularly 
polarized laser beam. A gas laser oscillator such as a carbon dioxide 
gas laser oscillator can provide high efficiency and high 
output power, so that it has widely been employed in a 
laser beam machining field. In the case of the aforesaid carbon dioxide gas 
laser oscillator, a CO2 molecule which is used as a laser 
medium is excited by a discharge generated in the resonator. 
However, an electric power supplied for the discharge 
is subject to limitation due to a durability of members 
constituting an excitation section and a rise of gas temperature 
caused by an excitation. Further, the aforesaid 
laser needs to enlarge an output beam diameter due to 
limitation of light-proof strength of an output mirror. 
For this reason, it is necessary to make an optical path of  
 
the resonator long in order to obtain high output power; as 
a consequence, the laser system becomes too large as a 
whole. Thus, in order to avoid enlarging the configuration 
of the system, most of the laser oscillators are constituted 
such that the optical path of the resonator is multitudinously 
folded back so that an entire length of the laser 
oscillator becomes short. Fig. 5 is a view schematically showing a configuration 
of a conventional folded-type resonator. In the 
figure, a resonator 20 comprises an output mirror 1, a rear 
mirror 2, excitation sections 3a and 3b, and reflecting 
mirrors 14a and 14b. All optical axes in the resonator 20 
are adjusted so as to be in the identical horizontal plane. 
In the resonator 20 having such optical axes, the laser 
beam emitted from the output mirror 1 is polarized, in the 
vertical direction at an angle of 90° to the horizontal 
plane, as shown by an arrow 21. When a laser beam is used for cutting metals or 
the like, it is desirable that a circularly polarized laser 
beam be irradiated to a workpiece in order to obtain high 
machining performance rather than a linearly polarized 
laser beam. For this reason, a linearly polarized laser 
beam in the vertical or horizontal direction is generally 
transformed to a circularly polarized laser beam by means 
of a mechanism as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 is a view showing a conventional optical  
 
system for transforming a linearly polarized laser beam to 
a circularly polarized laser beam. A laser beam emitted 
from the resonator
