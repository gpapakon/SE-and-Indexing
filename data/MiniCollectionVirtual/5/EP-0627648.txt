<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal device suitable for use in a display
apparatus, such as a television receiver, particularly
a liquid crystal display device using a ferroelectric
liquid crystal capable of gradational
display.A ferroelectric liquid crystal placed in a
bistable state tends to assume either one of bistable
states, i.e., one corresponding to an optically white
(bright) state and the other corresponding to an
optically black (dark) state, and does not assume an
intermediate state. Accordingly, some special
technique is required in order to effect a gradational
display by using such a ferroelectric liquid crystal.There is known a digital or dither technique
wherein one pixel is divided into sub-pixels for
driving. In a system using such a digital technique,
however, as one pixel is divided into a plurality of
sub-pixels for driving, so that a large number of
drive electrodes are required for one pixel. As a
result, the resolution is lowered and a complicated
operation or drive circuit is required, so that the
production yield is lowered.There is also known an analog technique for 
displaying a halftone. Examples thereof include a
proposal of utilizing a spontaneously occurring
unevenness irregularity on an electrode plate or an
intentionally formed mosaic pattern on an electrode
plate JP-A-59
193427) or a proposal of providing a stepwise
thickness change of an insulating layer on an
electrode plate (JP-A 61-166590; JP-A-O1 107233, respectively, for
generating a mixture state of white and black domains
in one pixel to display a halftone.In any of the above-mentioned analog
techniques, a liquid crystal layer in a liquid crystal
display device is provided with regions where
different electric fields are developed when a
voltage is applied between a pair of electrodes and an
analog control is intended to be performed by forming
a large number of such minute regions.It has been confirmed to be possible to form
a halftone state by such a known analog technique as
described above, it is necessary to obtain a
relationship between an applied voltage amplitude or
pulse width and a resultant transmittance (hereinafter
referred to as "V-T characteristic") based on which an
arbitrary halftone can be obtained easily. More
specifically, it is desirable to obtain a linear 1nV-T
characteristic curve having an appropriate slope at a
pixel or a unit display element. Further, such a linear lnV-T characteristic curve
is desirable also in case where the characteristic change
of a ferroelectric
