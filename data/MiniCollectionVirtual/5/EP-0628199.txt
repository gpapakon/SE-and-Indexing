<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic tape recording and reproducing system that has the capability of dividing the tape into a large number of separate partitions along the tape. The system defines groups of partitions of two sizes and the information relating to them is a part of system format data that is recorded with user data. The size of the partitions of each group, as well as the count of the number of partitions in each group can be specified by a host system which supplies the user data to be recorded.

recording of digital information at very high transfer rates.BACKGROUND ARTThe market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever increasing rate with the sales of Mgh-performance computers penetrating numerous industries ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these Mgh-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create

W__ATIS C__AIMED IS:
1. A system adapted to selectively record and reproduce digital data on a magnetic tape, and to define a plurality of boundaries along the lengtii of the tape, die boundaries separating the tape into a plurality of recording partitions, said system comprising: hehcal means adapted to selectively record and reproduce user data and system format data in recorded units on sets of hehcal tracks on a hehcal recording area of said tape; processing means for generating said system format data and for providing said user data and said system format data to said hehcal means for recording thereby on said tape, said processing means generating a subarea matrix of said system format data for recording on at least one prectetermined hehcal track of each set of hehcal tracks, said system format data includes format data relating to die existence of two groups of partitions are provided, with each group of partitions having a selectable number of partitions of a predetermined size, said system format data includes format data tiiat specifies the size and number of partitions of each group.
2. A system as defined in claim 1 wherein die size and number of partitions of one of said groups is selectable independentiy of die size and number of partitions of the otiier of said groups.
3. A system as defined in claim 1 wherein the system defines said boundaries to alternate between said two groups of partitions along said tape.
4. A system adapted to selectively record and reproduce digital data on a magnetic tape, and to define a plurality of partitions in which digital data can be recorded on said tape, said system comprising: means adapted to selectively record and reproduce user data and system format data in recorded units on first recording area of said tape; processing means for generating said system format data and for providing said user data and said system format data to said recording means for recording thereby on said tape, said system format data including data relating to the definition of first and second groups of partitions, said first group of partitions having a first selectable number of partitions of a first predeteÏ€nined size, said second group of partitions having a second selectable number of partitions of a second predetermined size.
5. A system as defined in claim 4 wherein said recording means is adapted to record said user data and system format data on hehcal tracks located on said first recording area of said tape. 


 6. A system as defined in claim 5 wherein the system defines said partitions to alternate between said first group and said second group along said tape.
