<ABSTRACT>
A dual chamber dispenser is formed of a first chamber (4) and a second chamber (6) connected together by a one-way valve (10) with the first chamber (4) holding a flowable first component to be mixed at a time of use with a second component in the second chamber (6). The one-way valve (10) permits flow from the first chamber (4) into the second chamber (6) but prevents any backflow from the second chamber (6) to the first chamber (4). A metered dose outlet chamber (14) is connected to the second chamber (6) by way of another one-way valve (12), so that the mixed components can be directed into the outlet chamber (14) but prevented from backflow into the second chamber (6). A dispensing head (2) is connected to the outlet chamber (12) for collapsing the outlet chamber (12) and dispensing selected amounts of the mixed components. With the components in the first (4) and second (6) chambers kept in a separated condition the dispenser has a long shelf life though the mixed components have only a relatively short period of use after the mixing has been effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a dispenser
containing two members according to the preamble of
claim 1 and a method for dispensing a mixture according
to claim 15.One of the members contains a substance to be mixed
with another substance such as diluent, in the
other member. The members are maintained such that
there is no flow between them during a storage period.
When the dispenser is to be used, substances
are mixed by introducing the substances from one
member into the other.In US-A-33 37 039 and 41 22 943, dispensing containers
are shown where components of a mixture to be
dispensed are kept separated during storage and
shipment until the mixture is ready to be dispensed.In US-A-33 37 039, collapsible chambers are arranged
to mix the components by collapsing the chambers
so that the components flow one into the
other. The chambers can be closed by closure caps
or by sealing one into the other by threaded engagement 
and providing a frangible seal in the
opening of one chamber interconnected to the other.In US-A-41 22 943, two compartments move telescopically
relative to one another, however, they are
not collapsible. The components are kept separated
by a one-way valve in one of the compartments. The
other compartment comprises another one-way valve,
which works as a pressure relief valve, so the mixed
components cannot be dispensed via this pressure
relief valve. For removing or dispensing the
mixture from the second compartment, a cover must
be unscrewed.In the past known dual chambers dispensers have been
used for solutions for mixtures having a relatively
short useful life. The two components of such
solution must be kept separated during shelf storage
to prevent deterioration of the solution prior
to its use.When the solution being used is a pharmaceutical or
drug solution, it is important that the solution,
when prepared for use, is maintained free of
contamination. If contamination in the form of
moisture, dust, gases in the ambient atmosphere and
the like, enter the solution, it is possible that
the solution will be rendered unfit for use. Therefore, it is the primary object of the present
invention to provide a dispenser for dispensing a mixture or
solution having a short use lifetime where the components of
the mixture or solution are capable of being stored separately
for an extended period, much longer than the lifetime of the
mixed components.In accordance with the present invention, the dispenser
is provided with two separate collapsible chambers one holding
one component or

(6) so that the first component can be forced

into the second member (6); and a second one-way
valve (12), associated with the second member (6),


wherein the improvement comprises
 means for dispensing
the mixture from the second member (6), which

dispensing means comprises a chamber (14), which is
connected via the second one-way valve (12) to the second

member (6) and via third valve means (20) with a dispensing
outlet (22), whereby the first and second members

(4,6) are collapsible.
A dispenser, as set forth in claim 1, wherein
the dispensing means (2, 12, 14, 20, 22, 24)

comprises third valve means (20) for delivering the mixture
for flow out of a dispensing outlet (22) to

the ambient atmosphere and for preventing any back-flow
of the mixture through the dispensing outlet

(22) into the dispenser and for preventing any flow
of contaminants from the ambient atmosphere through

the dispensing outlet (22) into the dispenser. 
A dispenser, as set forth in claim 2, wherein
the third valve means (20) comprises a third one way valve

(20) for conducting the mixture from the outlet
chamber (14) to the dispensing outlet (22).
A dispenser, as set forth in the claim 3,
wherein the outlet chamber (14) is compressible,

and the dispensing means (2, 12, 14, 20 , 22, 24)
includes a device for compressing the outlet chamber

(14) for directing flow from the outlet chamber
(14) through the third one-way valve (20) and out

of the dispensing outlet (22).
