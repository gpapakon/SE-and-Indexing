<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymerizable synthetic 
polyol(allyl carbonate) compositions and articles prepared therefrom, 
particularly articles having organic photochromic material(s) applied 
to or incorporated therein. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to certain polymerizable polyol(allyl carbonate) compositions 
that contain from 10 to 30 weight percent of a mixture of 
aliphatic urethanes, the terminal (or end) groups of which contain 
allyl and/or acrylyl unsaturation, and to photochromic articles 
prepared from polymerizates of such compositions. Depending on the 
amount and relative quantities of the acrylyl- and allyl-functional 
groups in the aliphatic urethane components in the polymerizable 
polyol(allyl carbonate) compositions, the initiated pot life of such 
compositions may vary from being relatively brief, e.g., 5 hours at 
25°C., to a pot life comparable to initiated diethylene glycol 
bis(allyl carbonate). Articles prepared from such compositions are 
nearly colorless and do not generally pre-release from the mold in 
which they are cured, e.g., in a constant temperature water bath. 
Photochromic articles prepared from such compositions are 
characterized by an improved photochromic response compared to 
photochromic articles prepared from a homopolymer of diethylene glycol 
bis(allyl carbonate). Photochromism is a phenomenon involving a change in color of 
a photochromic substance (or an article containing such a substance) 
when it is exposed to light radiation involving ultraviolet rays, such 
as ultraviolet radiation contained in sunlight or in the light of a 
mercury lamp, and a reversion to the original color when the influence 
of the ultraviolet radiation is discontinued, e.g., by storing the 
substance (or article) in the dark or removing the source of 
ultraviolet radiation. In recent years, photochromic plastic 
materials, particularly plastic materials for optical applications, 
have been the subject of considerable attention. In particular,  
 
photochromic ophthalmic plastic lenses have been investigated because 
of the weight advantage they offer, vis a vis, glass lenses. Moreover, 
photochromic transparencies for vehicles, such as cars and airplanes, 
have been of interest because of the potential safety features that 
such transparencies offer. When incorporated within the matrix of a synthetic organic 
transparency (or applied to a substrate of such matrix), a 
photochromic substance changes color when exposed to ultraviolet 
light. This change
