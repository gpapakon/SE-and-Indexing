<ABSTRACT>
In a spark plug including a cylindrical metallic 
shell, a tubular insulator supported within the metallic 

shell and a center electrode provided to axially extend 
within the insulator, an outer electrode is secured to a 

front end of the metallic shell in a manner to extend 
toward an elevational side of the center electrode. A 

first spark-erosion resistant noble metal tip is secured 
to an outer surface of the outer electrode which extends 

across a front open end of the metallic shell so as to 
form a spark gap between the extended end of the tip and 

the elevational side of the center electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spark plug and a 
method of making the spark plug in which a spark gap is 
provided between an elevational side of a center 
electrode axially extended in an tubular insulator and 
one end of a first spark-resistant noble metal tip 
secured to an outer electrode. In a spark plug for an internal combustion engine, 
the following techniques have been used to secure a 
spark-erosion resistant noble metal or noble metal alloy 
tip to an outer electrode. 
(i) As a noble metal tip 121, a thin layer of Pt-Ir or 
Pt-Ni alloy is welded to one end of an outer electrode 
120 in a manner to oppose an elevational side of a center 
electrode 110 of a spark plug 100 as shown in Fig. 16. (ii) A noble metal elongation 122 is secured to one end 
of the outer electrode 120 by means of argon welding in a 
manner to oppose an elevational side of the center  
 
electrode 110 of the spark plug 100 as shown in Fig. 17 and EP-A-0,171,994. (iii) A noble metal tip 123 is welded to an upper side 
120a of the outer electrode 120 in a manner to oppose a 
front end 110a of the center electrode 110 as shown in 
Fig. 18. (iv) A short pedestal 220 is placed on a front end 210a 
of a metallic shell 210 in a direction according to an 
extention of the metallic shell 210. Then a 
spark-resistant noble metal tip 230 is prepared from 
Pt-Ir or Pt-Ni alloy, and secured to one end of an outer 
electrode 240. Thereafter, the outer electrode 240 is 
secured to the short pedestal 220 by means of electric 
resistance welding. During the welding procedure, a 
spacer 260 is used to provide a spark gap between the tip 
230 and a center electrode 250 as shown in Fig. 19. In the technique (i), a variation may be induced 
in a lateral arm 120b of the outer electrode 120 to 
deteriorate its dimensional accuracy upon bending the 
outer electrode 120 into the L-shaped configuration after 
welding the thin layer of noble metal tip 121 to one end 
of the outer electrode 120. When the tip 121 is welded to 
the outer electrode 120 once the outer electrode is bent 
into the L-shaped configuration, it is troublesome to 
weld the tip 121 so as to only deteriorate mass 
production since one end of the outer electrode 120 is 
located to oppose the elavational side of the center 
electrode 110. The thin layer of the tip 121 shortens a  
 
distance between the one end of the outer electrode and 
the elavational side of the center electrode 110 so as to 
worsen the ignitibility due to an increased 
flame-extinguishing effect. In the
