<ABSTRACT>
An installation of a new operating system on a data processing 
system can be aborted, wherein an old operating 

system, which is already resident on the data processing 
system, can be reused. During the installation of the new 

operating system, temporary files of the new operating 
system are built on the data processing system, based on 

information provided by a user. This information may be 
provided by voice input. After building the temporary 

files, the user is given an opportunity to abort the installation. 
If the user elects to abort the installation, 

then the temporary files of the new operating system are 
deleted and use of the old operating system continues. If 

the user elects to continue with the installation, then 
the new operating system is installed onto the data processing 

system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method and system for
installing operating systems onto data processing systems.An operating system is computer software that is installed
onto a data processing system such as a workstation or a
computer. The operating system controls the execution of
programs on the data processing system. In addition, the
operating system typically provides services such as input/output
control, data management and resource allocation.Operating systems are frequently upgraded. In order to
install a new version of an operating system, the user
essentially replaces the old version that is resident on
the user's workstation with the new version. With prior
art installation methods, the installation of the new
version of the operating system damages the old version of
the operating system that exists on the data processing
system. Thus, if the user wishes to abort the installation
of the new operating system, the user is unable to do
so.Even if the installation of the new operating system could
be aborted, the old operating system is unusable because
of the damage it received during the installation of the
new operating system. This would leave the data processing
system without an operating system. Another problem is that the installation of the operating system
is typically a complex and difficult task. This is because
operating systems are designed to be flexible and thus provide
for many possible setup environments. During the installation of
an operating system, the user is typically-prompted to provide
information that is used for the installation. For example, the
user may be asked how the user wishes the hard disk drive on the
workstation is to be configured. Such complexity makes it
difficult for users to properly install an operating system.European Patent Application EP-A-0 398 647 (International
Business Machines) discloses an information processing system
utilizing a custom install diskette to install software such as a
multitasking operating system thereon. The multitasking operating
system includes a base operating system and a plurality of
separately installable components. The custom install diskette
includes a plurality of system independent files which
informs the information processing system of the components,
features and options to be installed thereon. A custom install
program determines a machine type which is associated with the
information processing system and then installs only the code
relating to the component, features, options and machine type
thereon.

<CLAIMS>
A computer implemented method for installing a new
operating system on a data processing system, said data

processing system having an old operating system located
thereon, said method characterized in that it comprises

the steps of:

a) building files of said new operating system in said
data processing system without damaging said old

operating system;
b) determining if the installation of said new
operating system is either to continue or is to be

aborted;
c) if the installation of said new operating system is
to be aborted, then deleting said files of said new

operating system and utilizing said old operating system
in subsequent operations of said data processing system;

and
d) if the installation of said new operating system is
to continue, then permanently storing said files of said

new operating system on said data processing system.
The method of claim 1, wherein said operating system
contains options, further comprising the steps of:


a) prompting a user of said data processing system for
information regarding said options; and
b) allowing said user to respond with voice sounds.
The method of claim 2, wherein said step of
prompting a user of said data processing system for

information regarding said options further comprises the
step of using voice sounds to prompt said user.
The method of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said step of permanently storing said files of

said new operating system on said data processing system 
further comprises the step of deleting said old operating

system.
The method of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said data processing system comprises volatile

data storage and nonvolatile data storage, wherein:

a) said step of building files of said new operating
system in said data processing system further comprises

the step of storing said files of said new operating
system in said volatile data storage; and
b) said step of permanently storing said files of said
new operating system on said data processing system

further comprises the step of storing said files of said
new operating system in said nonvolatile data storage.
The method of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said data processing system comprises an input

device, said step of building files of said new operating
system in said data processing system further comprises

the step of locking said input device during said step of
building files of said new operating system in said data

processing system so as to prevent the entry of data, but
to allow the entry of information relating to aborting

the installation.
The method of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said operating system contains options, further

comprising the steps of:

a) prompting a user of said data processing system for
information regarding said options; and
b) allowing said user to choose the manner of
responding, said manner of responding taken from the

group consisting of voice sounds, touching a display, a
mouse and a keyboard.
The method of any one of the preceding claims,
further comprising the step of accepting information 

regarding the installation of said operating system,
before said files are built.
A system comprising means adapted for carrying out
the method according to any one of the preceding claims.
