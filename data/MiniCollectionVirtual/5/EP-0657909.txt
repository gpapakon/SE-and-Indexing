<ABSTRACT>
It includes fixed contact means (51), moving contact means (5, 5a, 50) capable of taking up a working position and a rest position, an electrical fault detector (1, 2, 3, 14) reacting to a fault by setting itself to active position, and control means (6, 7, 20) for switching the said movable contact means in one or the other of the said positions. Releasable linking means (7b, 11, 11a) can selectively take up an engaged position, in which case they form a mechanical link between the said control means (6, 7, 20) and the said movable contact means (5, 5a, 50), and a tripped position, in which case the said movable contact means are mechanically decoupled from the said control means. These linking means in engaged position react to the setting of the fault detector (1 to 3, 14) in active position by putting themselves in tripped position.

contact means into one or other of said positions;
flexible restoring means for drawing the mobile contact

means towards their resting position; and an electrical
