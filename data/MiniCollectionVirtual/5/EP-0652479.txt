<ABSTRACT>
An integrated photographic processing plant is equipped with a number of treatment stations, all of which are arranged inside a common housing. They include an input station (2) for as yet undeveloped exposed roll-type film (F), for example 35 mm film wound up in film cartridges (S), in which the input roll-type films (F) are wound up and fed into a film transport system of an adjoining film processor (3). The photographic films (F) are developed in the film processor (3). A photographic copier (printer) (4) for printing, picture by picture, negatives contained on the developed film (F) onto photographic paper (P) is arranged at the exit of the film processor (3). The photographic copier (4) is equipped with a dedicated transport system for the developed film (F). Finally, a paper processor for developing the exposed photographic paper (P) and dispensing stations (13b, 13a) for the developed film (F) and the developed paper prints (I) are also provided. Between the exit of the film processor (3) and the photographic copier (4), there is arranged an intermediate store (5, 6) for developed individual films (F), which store is equipped with an automatic transport device (11, 12, 7) for transferring the developed individual films (F) to a negative carrier (41) of the photographic copier (4), which negative carrier can be operated independently of the transport systems of the film processor (3) and of the photographic copier (4). In the operating method according to the invention, the developed films (F) are removed completely from the film transport system of the film processor (3) before further processing and deposited in the intermediate store (5, 6). From there, they are then advanced by the automatic transport device (11, 12, 7) of the intermediate store (5, 6) to the photographic copier (4).

outlet from the stacker (5) for the transport cards (C), which pair of transport rollers (7)
is provided for the further transport of the transport cards (C).
Appliance according to Claim 6, characterised in that the forward feed means comprise
engagement fingers (11) which are eccentrically fastened in such a way on a rotatable

shaft (12), arranged below the stacker, that they can be brought into engagement with
