<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of 
N-aliphatic substituted p-phenylenediamine 
intermediates. In one aspect, this invention relates to 
the production of N-aliphatic substituted 
p-phenylenediamines. In another aspect, this invention 
relates to the production of N'-alkylated, N-aliphatic 
substituted p-phenylenediamines useful as antioxidants 
or antiozonants. It is known to prepare dialkyl substituted 
p-phenylenediamines by the reaction of a 
p-halonitrobenzene with ammonia to produce 
p-nitroaniline followed by reductive alkylation of the 
p-nitroaniline. This process involves a nucleophilic 
aromatic substitution mechanism wherein the ammonia 
replaces halide to produce the p-nitroaniline. This 
process is disadvantageous in that the halide that is 
displaced is corrosive to the reactors and appears in 
the waste stream and must therefore be disposed of at 
considerable expense. Therefore, a nonhalide route to 
N-aliphatic substituted p-phenylenediamines and the 
alkylated products thereof would provide significant 
advantages over current technology and result in a more 
efficient and economic commercial process. US-A-3.922.304 discloses that p-phenylenediamine is commonly produced via 
ammonolysis of p-chloronitrobenzene followed by reduction of the resulting p-nitroanile. 
US-A-4.140.718 discloses that N,N'-dialkylphenylenediamines are 
prepared by reductive alkylation of nitroaniline and ketone in the presence of 
hydrogen and a suitable hydrogenation catalyst. The process of the invention is such a 
nonhalide route to N-aliphatic substituted 
p-phenylenediamines and the alkylated products thereof 
and therefore eliminates the expensive halide removal 
from the waste stream as well as corrosion problems 
caused by the halide.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide a 
process for producing N-aliphatic substituted 
p-phenylenediamine intermediates for use in the 
production of N-aliphatic substituted 
p-phenylenediamines and N'-alkylated, N-aliphatic 
substituted p-phenylenediamines. It is a further object 
of the invention to provide an efficient and economic 
process to produce N-aliphatic substituted 
p-phenylenediamine intermediates and products thereof 
that is commercially viable. It is a further object of 
the invention to provide a process for producing 
N-aliphatic substituted p-phenylenediamines for use as 
intermediates to antioxidants. It is a still further 
object of the invention to provide a process for 
producing N'-alkylated, N-aliphatic substituted 
p-phenylened
