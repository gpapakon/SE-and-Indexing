<ABSTRACT>
An air bag assembly for a motor vehicle comprising an air bag (20) 
including when deflated first and second major side walls (34,36) 

adjacent to and substantially parallel to one another such that when 
deflated the air bag is in a substantially non-rolled and non-folded 

condition with the first and second side walls in contact with one 
another. 
The air bag (20) is stored in a 
door (12) of a motor vehicle in a 

position which can reduce deployment time and provide 
reliable orientation of the air bag upon deployment. 

The air bag is mounted in an upper portion (22) of the 

door (12), and an inflator (24) is mounted in a lower 
portion (26) of the door (12). The inflator (24) is 

in communication with the air bag (20) via a 
connecting air bag (28) which provides added padding 

upon inflation. A soft flexible material (32) 
overlies the air bag (20) to hide the air bag (20) 

from view as well as to retain the air bag in a 
non-rolled condition. The soft flexible material (32) 

is adhesively attached or stapled to an inner trim 
panel (30) of the door (12) and becomes detached from 

the inner trim panel (30) when the air bag inflates to 
push the soft flexible material (32) away from the 

inner trim panel (30) so that the air bag (20) can 
reach its inflated position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor 
vehicle door including an air bag. It is well known in motor vehicles to 
provide an inflatable air bag to cushion an occupant. It has been recognised that such an air bag 
may be mounted on a vehicle door to provide cushioning 
in a side impact situation. Such air bags are 
typically folded or rolled in a compact position, 
requiring the air bag to unfold and/or to unroll upon 
deployment before becoming inflated. DE-A-4119788 
discloses such an arrangement. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved air bag. A motor vehicle door in accordance with the 
present invention is characterised over DE-A-4119788 
by the features specified in the characterising 
portion of claim 1. Mounting a side air bag in an unfurled, 
deflated position can reduce deployment time and can 
provide reliable orientation of the side air bag upon 
inflation. In a preferred embodiment, an air bag is 
mounted in a vehicle door in an unfurled, deflated 
position extending along the length of the door. The 
unfurled air bag can require less deployment time 
since the air bag does not have to unfold or unfurl 
upon deployment. The unfurled position can also 
provide a reliable orientation of the air bag upon 
deployment since the air bag need not unfold or unfurl 
to a designated position. In the preferred embodiment, the unfurled 
air bag is mounted in an upper portion of a vehicle 
door and a conventional inflator is mounted in a lower  
 
portion of the door. The inflator is in communication 
with the air bag via a connecting air bag or flexible 
duct. When inflated, the connecting air bag provides 
added padding to the door. In an embodiment, the air bag is retained 
within a cavity provided between an inner trim panel 
of the door and a soft trim material. The soft trim 
material overlies the air bag to retain it in the 
unfurled position and to hide the air bag from view. 
Upon deployment, the soft trim material yields to the 
inflating air bag, thereby allowing the air bag to 
fill the space between the seated occupant and the 
door. The soft trim material may be adhesively 
attached or stapled to the inner trim panel of the 
door so that it becomes detached from the inner trim 
panel upon inflation of the air bag so as to push the 
soft trim material away from the door. An additional 
embodiment provides a weakened portion in the soft 
trim material which tears upon inflation of the air 
bag, so as to push the soft trim material away from 
the door while the periphery of the

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle door comprising an inner trim panel (30); a 
soil trim panel (32) overlying the inner trim panel and having a yieldable 

portion (38,46); a cavity (29) between the inner trim panel and the soil trim 
panel in an upper portion (22) of the door (12); an air bag (20) positioned in 

the cavity; an inflator (24) actuable to inflate the air bag and mounted in a 
lower portion (26) of the door; characterised in that the air bag (20) includes, 

when deflated and positioned in the cavity (29), first and second side walls 
(34,36) adjacent to and substantially parallel to one another such that when 

deflated the air bag is stored in the cavity in a substantially non-rolled and 
non-folded condition with the first and second side walls in contact with one 

another. 
A motor vehicle door as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
yieldable portion of the soil trim panel (32) comprises an edge (38) which is 

adhered to the inner trim panel (30) and which is detachable from the inner 
trim panel on inflation of the air bag (20) so as to push the soil trim panel 

away from the inner trim panel. 
A motor vehicle door as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
yieldable portion of the soil trim panel (32) comprises an edge (38) which is 

stapled to the inner trim panel (30) and which is detachable from the inner 
trim panel on inflation of the air bag (20) so as to push the soil trim panel 

away from the inner trim panel. 
A motor vehicle door as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
yieldable portion of the soil trim panel (32) comprises a weakened portion 

(46) which is capable of being torn on inflation of the air bag (20). 
A motor vehicle door as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 
4, further comprising a duct (28) connected to and in communication with the  

 
inflator (24) and the air bag (20), the duct being positioned between the inner 

trim panel (30) and an inner door panel (43) of the door (12). 
A motor vehicle door as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the 
duct is in the form of an air bag (28).
