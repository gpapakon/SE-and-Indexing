<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for testing hearing comprises a sound source (3) for applying a sound to the subject's ear and a sound detector (5) for detecting the sound returned from the subject's inner ear in response to the sound. The sound source (3), which is driven by stimulus generation equipment (2) connected to an analyser (1), produces a sequence of sounds constituting a maximum length sequence (MLS) to record Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for, and a method of, 
testing hearing. EP 0015258 discloses hearing faculty testing apparatus 
comprising an aural probe for insertion into a subject's 
external ear canal. The probe includes an electroacoustic 
transducer for projecting sound into the ear canal and for 
responding to sound waves returned from the inner ear in 
response to the projected sound. The transducer is 
energised by a pulse generator which is said to have a 
maximum useful frequency of about 50 Hz, because at higher 
frequencies the echoes overlap with succeeding pulses. 
Throughout, this prior patent specification refers to 
extracting echoes by electronic time gating. The need to 
avoid overlapping and to extract the echoes by time gating 
represents a disadvantage which the present invention aims 
to overcome. According to one aspect of the invention apparatus for 
testing hearing comprises a sound source for applying a  
 
sound to a subject's ear and a sound detector for 
detecting the sound returned from the subject's inner ear 
in response to said sound, characterised in that said 
sound source produces a sequence of sounds constituting a 
maximum length sequence (MLS), a variant of such a 
sequence or a variant of a similar sequence. Possible 
variants are Legendre sequences, M-pulse sequences and De 
Bruijn sequences. According to another aspect of the invention there is 
provided a method of testing hearing, wherein sound is 
applied to a subject's ear and the sound reflected from 
the subject's inner ear is detected, characterised in that 
the sound sequence constitutes a maximum length sequence 
(MLS), a variant of such a sequence or a variant of a 
similar sequence. The invention thus resides in the use 
of a maximum length sequence (or similar sequence) to 
record Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (EOAEs). The 
invention uses stimulation at rates higher than 50 Hz. Two sequences may be used simultaneously and two ears may 
be tested simultaneously. EOAEs are acoustic signals produced by the motile cochlear 
hair cells in response to the input stimulus and 
transmitted through the middle ear space to the external 
acoustic meatus where they can be recorded using a 
microphone. EOAEs are like fingerprints and vary markedly 
between ears and individuals but are remarkably stable 
within an individual. A maximum length sequence (MLS) is a quasi-random binary 
sequence with strictly defined mathematical properties.  
 The MLS is a pseudorandom binary (or multi level sequence) 
x(n)
