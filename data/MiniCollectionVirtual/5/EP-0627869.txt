<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a radiation-type heater, including a cooking hot plate (1), a radiating heating body (10) consisting, on the one hand, of a support frame (11) provided with at least one thermally and electrically insulating layer (12, 4) associated with at least one external reflector (2) and, on the other hand, heating elements (13) consisting of resistive wires (13c), as well as of a thermal sensor (21) combined with a control and regulation circuit, characterised in that the heating elements (13) are constituted by the resistive wires (13c) wound around bars (13b), the said heating elements being associated with a thermal sensor (21) capable of continuously measuring the temperature of the said heater so as to carry out thermal environment regulation as a function of a set temperature fixed by the user. - Application to glass-ceramic hobs which can be laid down or inset.
