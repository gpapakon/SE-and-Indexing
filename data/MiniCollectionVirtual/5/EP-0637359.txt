<DESCRIPTION>
Catalyst units are among other tasks used for cleaning of 
exhaust gases from combustion engines through oxidation of 
hydrocarbons and reduction of oxides of nitrogen. They are 
commonly made as a ceramic carrier monolith body with 
parallel channels, and a surface coating of catalytically 
active material such as platinum, palladium or other metals. 
The catalytic materials require an elevated temperature in 
use to reach full activity. If no special means are 
employed, the activity is lowest when the exhaust contains 
most hydrocarbons right after the start of the engine. There 
is always some low activity, and the increasing temperature 
of the exhaust due to the exothermic reaction at the 
oxidation of the hydrocarbons will heat the whole cathalyst 
unit to an active temperature after a while. Different ways to preheat the catalyst unit before starting 
the engine have been suggested, such as making the monolith 
of electrically conducting material which is then heated by 
electric current or by magnetically induced eddy currents. 
Another suggestion has been to blow hot clean gas through 
the unit. These suggestions have disadvantages in requiring 
expensive or bulky auxiliary equipment. It has been 
suggested in the patent EP 286 932 to heat a monolith for 
ceramic diesel filters by electric resistance wires located 
near the entry side, but relying only on the electric power 
will require longer time and more power than is desirable 
for catalysts. The invention describes means for rapid heating of catalyst 
units comprising ceramic carrier monolith bodies, by using 
the electric power to start a localized catalytic reaction, 
which heats the rest of the monolith.  
 A ceramic monolith comprises a great number of channels with 
thin walls coated with the catalytic material. The monolith 
has an entry face and an exit face. According to the 
invention a metal wire is placed near the entry face across 
the channels. The wire is made of a heat resistant alloy 
such as chromium steel with at least 15 % Cr, preferably 
between 19 % and 26 %. The wire is preferably made with a 
flat strip cross section which is oriented to reduce the 
flow resistance of the channels as little as possible, with 
the large diameter in the direction of the channels. At a 
start of the engine the wire is heated by an electric 
current, thereby heating also the adjoining catalytic 
material to full active temperature through heat radiation, 
heat conduction or by heating the gas flow. Oxidation of 
hydrocarbons will then
