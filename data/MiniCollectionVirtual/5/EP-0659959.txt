<ABSTRACT>
The tower (5) includes a foundation structure (6), an 
observation cabin (7) and a tower structure (8) arranged 

between the foundation structure (6) and the cabin (7) 
and including a plurality of identical, superposed 

modules (21). In order to convey personnel rapidly 
between an additional base module (34) and the module 

(21) under the cabin (7), a lift (19) is provided which 
is operated by an electrical generator arranged in the 

foundation structure (6). The modules (21, 34) are also 
interconnected by runged ladders (32, 32', 32''). The 

cabin (7) has walls (46, 47) with glazed units (56), a 
peripheral balcony (51) accessible through a door (57) 

and an insulated roof (64). Each module (21) may be 
constituted by tubular rods (22,23, 26, 27) arranged in 

a three-dimensional lattice and may have an associated 
sheath (74) formed by a mesh screen (77). The sheath 

(74) includes a portion (76) extending towards the 
underlying module (21) so as to form a semitransparent 

cladding for the tower (5) in the form of a sectioned 
cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a watch tower, 
particularly for fire-watching and reporting of fires. As is known, the prevention of forest fires is becoming 
increasingly important. This prevention also includes 
surveillance of an area and the provision of early 
warnings of fires to control centres. Surveillance may 
be carried out and warnings given from watch towers 
appropriately positioned across the territory under 
observation. Watch towers known until now have several drawbacks. 
First of all, they are not modular structures and are 
therefore relatively expensive. In addition, even 
lattice-work structures spoil the landscape owing to 
their architectural and structural configuration. 
Furthermore, access to the observation and control cabin 
is by means of external or internal ladders which involve 
both real and psychological difficulties for the staff. 
Finally, they are subjected to all kinds of vandalism. The object of the invention is to provide a watch tower 
which is extremely efficient and eliminates the 
disadvantages listed in connection with the prior art.  This object is achieved by the watch tower of the 
invention which includes at least one foundation 
structure, an observation cabin and a tower structure 
arranged between the foundation structure and the cabin 
and is characterised in that a lift is housed in the 
tower structure for the rapid transport of personnel 
between the foundation structure and the cabin. According to another aspect of the invention, this tower 
structure includes a lattice constituted by a plurality 
of identical superposed modules, each of these modules 
being formed by tubular rods arranged in a three-dimensional 
lattice, each module having an associated 
mesh-screen sheath for covering at least part of its 
elevation. In order to provide a better understanding of the 
invention, a few preferred embodiments thereof will now 
be described by way of example with the aid of the 
appended drawings, in which: 
Figure 1a is a vertical section of an upper portion 
of a first embodiment of a watch tower according to the 
invention; Figure 1b is a vertical section of a lower portion 
of the tower of Figure 1a; Figure 2 is a section taken on the line II-II of 
Figure 1a on an enlarged scale; Figure 3 is a section taken on the line III-III of  
 
Figure 1a, also on an enlarged scale; Figure 4 is a section taken on the line IV-IV of 
Figure 1b; Figure 5 is a section taken on the line V-V of
