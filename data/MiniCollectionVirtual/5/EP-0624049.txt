<ABSTRACT>
A yoke (96), which has an inner peripheral wall (96b) 
formed concentrically with an outer peripheral wall (96a), is 

used in a magnetic circuit of a loudspeaker. A rare 
earth element magnet ring (98) is disposed between the outer 

and inner peripheral walls of the yoke (96) so as to form a 
magnetic gap (99) there. Thus, a compact, light and powerful 

magnetic circuit is obtained. The magnetic circuit is 
disposed in front of a diaphragm (103), which reduces the 

thickness of the loudspeaker. By making the projected 
area of the magnetic circuit on the diaphragm a half or 

less of the effective area of the diaphragm, deterioration 
of the performance properties and the quality of 

reproduced sounds can be avoided. Moreover, a heat 
dissipator (110) is provided on the yoke (96) so as to prevent any 

extraordinary or damaging increase in temperature of a 
voice coil even when large signals are continuously 

input to the loudspeaker. As a result, performance 
properties of the loudspeaker can be stabilized and 

reliability thereof can be enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a loudspeaker
apparatus for use in various audio devices, and
particularly to a thin, compact, and high-performance
loudspeaker apparatus.In recent years, there has been increasing
demand for a thin loudspeaker apparatus (simply referred
to as a loudspeaker hereinafter) capable of
high-quality sound reproduction, due to the diversified
uses of loudspeakers and the various conditions under
which loudspeakers are used.Figure 1 shows a cross section of an exemplary
configuration for a conventional loudspeaker.
Since the loudspeaker is symmetrical about the central
axis thereof, only a half portion of the cross section
is shown in Figure 1 (referred to as a half cross
section hereinafter).As is shown in Figure 1, a magnet ring 2 is
disposed on a saucer-shaped lower plate 1. The lower
plate 1 has a center pole 1a. A ring-shaped upper
plate 3 is disposed on the magnet 2. A gap 4 is formed
between the center pole 1a and the upper plate 3.
Thus, the lower plate 1 and the upper plate 3 are
layered and connected with each other, with the
magnet 2 interposed therebetween, so as to constitute a
magnetic circuit 12 including the gap 4. On the upper face of the upper plate 3, a
bowl-shaped frame 5 is attached. The outer periphery
of a diaphragm 8 is attached to the circular peripheral
portion of the frame 5 with an edge 7 interposed therebetween.
The edge 7 is fixed onto the circular peripheral
portion of the frame 5 by means of a gasket 6. On
the other hand, a voice coil 9 is inserted into the
gap 4 without being off-centered. The voice coil 9 is
connected with the inner periphery of the diaphragm 8,
and is supported by the frame 5 through a suspension 10
interposed therebetween, the suspension 10 being disposed
in the vicinity of the middle portion of the
voice coil 9. Furthermore, a dome-shaped dust cover 11
is attached onto the upper surface of a central portion
of the diaphragm 8 so as to prevent dust from entering
the interior of the loudspeaker.Miniaturization and reduction in thickness of
a conventional loudspeaker as shown in Figure 1 have
been realized mainly by miniaturizing and reducing the
thickness of each component element.Figure 2 shows a half cross section of an
exemplary conventional loudspeaker in which thickness
has been reduced.According to this conventional loudspeaker, a
magnet cylinder 22 is attached on a lower plate 21. A
saucer-shaped upper plate 23 is further attached on the
magnet 22. The peripheral portion 21a of the lower
plate 21 is formed so as to
