<ABSTRACT>
Filled crystalline thermoplastic resin chips are incorporated into a filled synthetic resin 
matrix for producing varicolored mineral appearing articles. Wollastonite filled 

polyphthalamide resin chips increase the surface hardness and decrease the ASTM E 84 
Smoke Index of neopentyl glycol/isophthalic polyester molded articles. Crystalline 

thermoplastics can be extruded in shapes for providing varishaped chips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molded thermoplastic articles that have a mineral 
appearance. This invention relates to thermoplastic articles molded with synthetic resin 
chips for imparting a granite or other varicolored appearance to the article. Mineral appearing molded synthetic resin articles are being fabricated into commercially 
attractive, prestigious cabinets, vanities and other decorative items. These mineral 
appearing molded synthetic resin articles are commercially available as flat sheets and as 
sinks and basins. Fabrication of these articles into decorative items is being achieved with 
commercially available woodworking tools and techniques. (See United States Patent 
5,043,377) The synthetic resins used for molding these articles can be commercially available 
transparent, unsaturated polyester or cross-linked methyl methacrylate thermosetting 
resin forming compositions. The synthetic resins used for producing these articles are 
highly filled with mineral particles having substantially the same refractive index as the 
cured matrix synthetic resin. The mineral particles have particle sizes less than about 50 
microns for producing articles in which the mineral particles are transparent. Molded articles filled with 50 to 80 percent by weight of the molded article of mineral 
particles have surface hardnesses approaching the surface hardness of minerals. Surface 
hardnesses along with the transparency of the matrix synthetic resin of these molded 
articles contribute substantially to their commercial attractiveness. (See United States 
Patents 3,396,067 and 3,405,088)  Alumina trihydrate (Al₂O₃ · 3H₂O) can be used as the mineral particles. Alumina 
trihydrate releases water when heated for imparting reduced flame spread and smoke 
density to the molded article. Articles molded with commercially available unsaturated 
polyester resin and filled with alumina trihydrate can meet flame spread and smoke 
density requirements for construction materials. (See United States Patents 3,780,156; 
3,827,933; 4,193,908 and 5,164,425) A granite or other varicolored mineral appearance can be achieved with these molded 
articles by incorporating synthetic resin chips in the synthetic resin forming composition. 
The chips can be opaque or translucent for providing visibility for the chips in the 
molded article. Pigmented chips can provide a color contrast between the chips and the 
matrix synthetic resin of the molded article. The size and concentration of these chips are 
selected to provide a
