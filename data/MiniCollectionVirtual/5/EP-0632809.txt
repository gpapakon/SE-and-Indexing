<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to useful peptidic quinuclidine derivatives of
interest to those in the field of medical chemistry and chemotherapy. More particularly,
it is concerned with a novel series of peptidic substituted 3-aminoquinuclidine, including
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutical compositions comprising
such compounds, which are of special value in view of their ability to antagonize
substance P. In this way, these compounds are of use in treating gastrointestinal
disorders, central nervous system disorders, inflammatory diseases, asthma and pain
or migraine.E. J. Warawa in USP 3560510 discloses certain 3-amino-2-benzhydrylquinuclidines
as being useful as diuretic agents, with the corresponding unsubstituted
3-benzylamino compounds acting as intermediates for same. Additionally, E. J.
Warawa et al. in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 18, p. 587 (1975) extends this
work to other members of the series wherein the 3-amino moiety is either ethylamino,
β-phenylethyl amino, β-isopropylamino, or 2-furfurylamino, but in no instance is there
any substitution on the phenyl group itself and the 2-benzhydryl moiety is always
symmetrically substituted (or unsubstituted).Furthermore, neither of the aforementioned documents teaches or suggests any
of these compounds to be useful as substance P antagonists.Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin
family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt stimulatory action
on smooth muscle tissue. More specially, substance P is a pharmaceutically active
neuropeptide that is produced in mammals (having originally been isolated from gut)
and possesses a characteristic amino acid sequence that is illustrated by D. F. Veber
et al. in USP 4680283. The wide involvement of substance P and other tachykinins in
the pathophysiology of numerous diseases has been amply demonstrated in the art.
For instance, substance P has recently been shown to be involved in the transmission
of pain or migraine (see B. E. B. Sandberg et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol.
25, p. 1009 (1982)), as well as in central nervous system disorders such as anxiety and
schizophrenia, in respiratory and inflammatory diseases such as asthma and
rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, and in gastrointestinal disorders and diseases of GI 
tract, like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's diseases, etc (see D. Regoli in "Trends in Cluster
Headache" edited by F. Sicuteri et al., Elsevier Scientific Publishers, Amsterdam, 1987,
pp.
