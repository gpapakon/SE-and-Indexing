<ABSTRACT>
A rotary actuator disk drive uses substantially identical dual-element 
inductive write/magnetoresistive read transducers for both the 

top (11) and bottom (12) 
disk surfaces. There is no requirement that the read 

elements (91,95) be mechanically offset from the write elements (92,96), 
as is 

typically the case in rotary actuator disk drives due to the head-to-track 
skew caused by the inherent nonlinear path of the heads across 

the data tracks. The transducers are supported on the trailing ends of 
the head carrier (13,17,90,94) 

 in such a manner that the geometric centers of the 
read and write elements are aligned without any mechanical offset (d). 

The 
sense current (108) for the magnetoresistive elements is provided with 

opposite polarity to the elements (120,122) 
on the top and bottom disk surfaces 

to shift the magnetic centers (110) 
of the top and bottom read elements in 

opposite directions relative to their geometric centers (104). The amount 
and direction of the magnetic shift is such that the read elements are 

effectively offset from their respective write elements so that the 
skew caused by the rotary actuator has minimal effect on alignment of 

the read and write elements with the data tracks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to data recording disk drives, 
and more particularly to magnetic recording rotary actuator disk drives 
that use dual-element read/write transducers. Disk drives, also called disk files, are information storage 
devices that use a rotatable disk with concentric data tracks 
containing the information, a head or transducer for reading and/or 
writing data onto the various tracks, and an actuator connected to a 
carrier for the head for moving the head to the desired track and 
maintaining it over the track centerline during read or write 
operations. There are typically a plurality of disks separated by 
spacer rings and stacked on a hub that is rotated by a disk drive 
motor. A housing supports the drive motor and head actuator and 
surrounds the head and disk to provide a substantially sealed 
environment for the head-disk interface. In conventional magnetic recording disk drives, the head carrier 
is an air-bearing slider that rides on a bearing of air above the disk 
surface when the disk is rotating at its operational speed. The slider 
is maintained next to the disk surface by a suspension that connects 
the slider to the actuator. The slider flies over the disk surface as 
a consequence of a balance of the spring force from the suspension and 
the air pressure generated by the velocity of the rotating disk. In contrast to conventional air-bearing disk drives, liquid-bearing 
disk drives have been proposed that use a head carrier that is 
at least partially supported by a liquid film on the disk. In one type 
of liquid-bearing disk drive, as described in IBM's pending 
application, U.S. Serial No. 264,604, filed October 31, 1988, and 
published May 9, 1990, as European published application EP-A-367510, 
and in US-A-5,097,368, a relatively thick, continuously recirculating 
liquid film is maintained on the disk surface and the head carrier is  
 
maintained in continuous contact with the liquid film when the disk is 
rotating at its normal operating speed. In a variation of the liquid-bearing 
disk drive, as described in US-A-4,901,185 assigned to Toshiba 
and US-A-5,202,803 assigned to IBM, a combined air and liquid bearing 
supports the head carrier, which is in contact or partial contact with 
a relatively thin liquid film on the disk. In both air-bearing and liquid-bearing disk drives, the most 
common form of actuator is a rotary actuator that moves the head 
carriers in a nonlinear, generally arcuate path across the disk 
surfaces. Typically, there are two
