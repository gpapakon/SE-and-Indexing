<DESCRIPTION>
 Storage of Nematodes in Pseudoplastic LayersTechnical Field The invention relates to techniques for storing entomogenous nematodes in the infective juvenile stage for later use as agricultural pest control agents. More specifically, the invention concerns formulating and packaging infective juveniles into pseudoplastic layers for prolonged storage and convenient dispensation when use is desired.Background ArtThe desirability of using entomogenous nematodes in compositions to control pests in agricultural contexts has been clearly recognized. The general classification "nematodes" includes roundworms of astounding variety ranging in size from ultramicroscopic to worms of several feet in length. In many cases, these organisms are parasitic, and their mechanisms of parasitism and their targets are as varied as their size range. Plant pathogenic nematodes are a recognized agricultural nuisance, and various toxic compounds have been formulated to control their growth. Parasitic diseases in animals and humans caused by these parasites include heartworm in dogs and river blindness in humans.However, a relatively benevolent group of nematodes infects insects that are themselves agricultural pests, and thus this group is seen as having 

 a useful function. In particular, control of insect infestation of plants has. been attempted using the "infective juvenile" stage of these entomogenous nematodes. In this form, the infective juvenile or "IJ" enters the host insect through the alimentary canal or spiracles, emerges from its protective sheath, and penetrates into the host insect's hemocoel. In the host insect's hemocoel the nematode releases symbiotic bacteria which induce septicemia that kills the host and renders the host corpse suitable for nematode foraging and reproduction. Several generations may be spent within the insect host until food consumption and overpopulation trigger production of another IJ stage generation. The new infective juveniles must then find fresh hosts.In the infective juvenile stage, the nematodes do not eat, but depend upon internal food stores; however, they do require oxygen, and, unless induced into a cryptobiotic desiccated state, require the presence of water.A major problem associated with the use of infective juvenile nematodes as pesticides resides in the necessity to maintain the infective juveniles in a viable state for extended time periods. The infective juveniles cannot be kept viable simply by harvesting them from, for example, an artificial culture, and placing them

 infective juveniles per ml.
4. The formulation of claim 1 which further contains a stabilizing agent to provide a specific gravity of 1.03-1.1 g/ml.
5. The formulation of claim 4 wherein said stabilizing agent is 10-20% sucrose or 20-30% dextran.
6. The formulation of claim 1 wherein said layer is contained in a sealed water-impermeable, oxygen- permeable flat compartment.
7. The formulation of claim 6 wherein said sealed flat compartment is contained in an approximately two-dimensional envelope array comprised of a multiplicity of said sealed compartments. 


 8. The formulation of claim l wherein said infective juveniles are of the family Steinernematidae or Heterorhabdi tidae .
9. A method to prepare a storage formulation of infective juvenile entomogenous nematodes, which method comprises mixing a suspension of said infective juveniles with a solution of a pseudoplastic agent to form a pseudoplastic mixture containing said nematodes and forming said mixture into a layer.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein said forming into a layer is effected by spreading said mixture onto a surface coated with a water-impermeable film.
11. The method of claim 9 wherein said forming into a layer is effected by placing said mixture into water-impermeable, oxygen permeable flat compartment and positioning said compartment in a horizontal position.
12. The method of claim 9 wherein said pseudoplastic agent is rhamsan gum or xanthan gum.
13. The method of claim 9 which further comprises including said layer in a sealed water- impermeable, oxygen-permeable flat compartment.
14. The method of claim 13 wherein said sealed flat compartment is contained in a substantially two- dimensional envelope array comprised of a multiplicity of said sealed compartments. 


 15. The method of claim 9 wherein said suspension contains about 10

16. The method of claim 9 wherein said infective juveniles are of the family Steinernematidae or He terorhabdi tidae.
17. A package for storing infective juvenile entomogenous nematodes, which package comprises a sealed water-impermeable oxygen-permeable flat compartment containing a layer comprising a pseudoplastic mixture of said infective juveniles, said pseudoplastic mixture comprising a pseudoplastic agent.
18. The package of claim 17 wherein said pseudoplastic agent is rhamsan gum or xanthan gum.
19. The package of claim 17 wherein said sealed compartment is contained in a substantially two- dimensional envelope array comprised of a multiplicity of said sealed compartments.
