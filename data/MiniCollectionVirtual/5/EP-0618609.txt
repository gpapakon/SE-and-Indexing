<ABSTRACT>
The electric lamp comprises a cap (10) having a housing (11) in a base 
portion (13) of which holes (14) are present to allow current conductors (3) to extend to 

contact members (15) of the cap. In the housing (11) a rubber disk (20) is present 
against the base portion (13), kept pressed against it by a pressing member (30). The 

rubber disk is pierced by the current conductors (3), sealing the cap and preventing 
volatile compounds to enter a reflector in which the lamp may be mounted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric lamp provided with: 
a light-transmitting lamp vessel which is closed in a vacuumtight manner 
and in which an electric element is arranged connected to current conductors which 
issue to the exterior from the lamp vessel; a lamp cap which is securely connected to the lamp vessel and which has 
a housing of synthetic resin with an outwardly projecting collar and a base portion 
comprising openings through which the current conductors extend to contact members 
of the lamp cap, sealing means being present in the housing for sealing off the openings in 
the base portion around the current conductors. Such an electric lamp is known from EP 0 129 868-B1. The lamp is 
suitable for use as a vehicle headlamp when mounted in a reflector. It is desirable in 
this application that moisture and pollutants cannot deposit in the reflector. The 
outwardly projecting collar is designed to abut against the reflector so as to limit the 
depth to which the lamp can be inserted through an opening in the reflector. Sealing means are present in the known lamp for preventing moisture and 
pollutants entering the reflector along the current conductors through the lamp cap. 
After the lamp vessel has been aligned with its electric element relative to the lamp cap, 
the current conductors are fastened to the contact members in the known lamp. Then a 
quantity of sealing compound is brought into the lamp cap housing and this compound is 
made to solidify at a raised temperature during, for example, one hour. A liquid or 
powdery synthetic resin, for example epoxy resin, is used for this purpose. A disadvantage of the construction of the known lamp is that the 
application and drying or curing of the compound is time-consuming and retards the 
production process. It is also necessary to prevent volatile components from the 
compound from being released during lamp operation. Another disadvantage is that only  
 
those materials can be used which adhere both to the lamp cap and to the current 
conductors. A further disadvantage is that the sealing compound could pollute the lamp, 
for example, the lamp vessel. The lamp cap of the known lamp is a linear one, i.e. the contact members 
lie in the extended direction of the lamp vessel. EP 0 172 529-B1 discloses another lamp designed for use in a reflector 
where the lamp cap has collars around the respective openings in the base portion, 
which collars are fused to the current conductors after these current conductors have 
been passed through. A
