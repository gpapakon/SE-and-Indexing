<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical formulations of cefaclor, suitable for the direct-compression
manufacture of dispersible tablets, containing the antibiotic cefaclor in an amount

between 35% and 50% by weight of the total weight of the formulation, along with
suitable excipients and coadjuvants selected from disintegrators, diluents, lubricants,

antiadherents, sweeteners, fragrances and, optionally, flavorings, opacifiers and
colorants. Said formulations are suitable for the manufacture of dispersible tablets

which disintegrate in less than three minutes in water at 19° - 21°C, and are suitable for
the treatment of infections caused by bacteria strains sensitive to cefaclor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to pharmaceutical formulations containing cefaclor suitable for the
manufacture of solid pharmaceutical forms for oral administration. In particular, the
invention refers to pharmaceutical formulations and dispersible tablets containing
cefaclor, and their manufacturing process.Cefaclor or 3-chloro-7-D-(phenylglycinamide)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid is a semisynthetic
cephalosporinic antibiotic described for example in US Patent no. 3,925,372
and German Patent No. DE 2,408,698 (Eli Lilly & Co.). Its bactericide action is based
on its capacity to inhibit cell wall synthesis. Cefaclor is indicated for treatment of
infections caused by sensitive strains of numerous organisms, particularly
Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.Pharmaceutical forms currently available for administration of cefaclor include capsules,
retard tablets and suspensions, both in phial and sachet form.There are a number of limitations and drawbacks to the use of capsules affecting the
following:
their administration to the patient, which may be limited because some may have
problems in swallowing them, particularly children and the elderly who may even be
unable to do so; andthe fact that they permit only a single dosage.On the other hand, the drawback to cefaclor administration in suspension (sachets) is
that, due to its saccharose content, its potential use is limited in diabetic patients, who
must take the appropriate precautions.Moreover, added to this drawback caused by the saccharose content, administration of
cefaclor in suspension (phial) has further disadvantages which may be summarised as
follows:
risk of accidental overdose due to uncontrolled consumption, particularly in
children; andthe difficulties of handling and transport because of the volume involved, 
leading to some risk of failure to complete the therapy, with the attendant loss of
efficacy.Retard tablets have the drawback of not permitting double dosage of the product;
moreover, they are not suitable for patients with difficulties in ingesting solid forms.Existing forms of administration of cefaclor do not in general meet entirely satisfactorily
some requirements considered desirable in the treatment of bacterial infections, for
example their application to any patient in conditions such as to ensure that the therapy
is completed, thereby enhancing its efficacy.There is thus a requirement for new pharmaceutical forms for administering cefaclor
which solve these problems, making it easier for the patient to administer them, and so
that they can

in an amount of approximately 14% by weight of total formulation weight, and (ii)

carboxymethylcellulose in an amount of approximately 10% by weight of total formulation weight,
as disintegrator.
A process as set forth in claim 2 in which microcrystalline cellulose, dry flowing starch and
their mixtures, is present as diluent.
A process as set forth in claim 8 in which the microcrystalline cellulose is present in an
amount between 24% and 46% by weight of total formulation weight.
A process as set forth in claim 9 in which said microcrystalline cellulose has a mean particle
size of approximately 90 microns.
A process as set forth in claim 8 in which the formulation comprisesg dry flowing starch in
an amount of approximately 39% by weight of total formulation weight.
A process as set forth in claim 2 in which stearyl sodium fumarate is present as lubricant, in
an amount of less than 2% by weight of total formulation weight.
A process as set forth in claim 2 in which colloidal silicon dioxide is present as antiadherent,
in an amount of less than 5% by weight of total formulation weight.
A process as set forth in claim 2 in which aspartame, sodium saccharin or their mixtures are
present as sweetener, in an amount of less than 1% by weight of total formulation weight.
