<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and 
methods for producing patterned soft gelatin capsules. Capsules are solid dosage forms in which 
therapeutic agents are enclosed in a soluble gelatin 
wall. The wall can be made of either soft or hard 
gelatin. Soft gelatin capsules ("SGC" or soft gels) 
comprise a soft, globular, gelatin wall. The gelatin 
may be plasticized by the addition of additives such 
as glycerin, sorbitol, or a similar types of polyols. 
Soft gelatin capsules offer a convenient dosage form 
for the administration of drugs, nutrients, vitamins, 
foodstuff and cosmetics. Commercially available SGCs come in a wide choice 
of sizes and shapes, e.g., they may be round, oval, 
oblong, tubular or suppository-shaped. These SGCs are 
formed by joining two identical halves to form a shell 
encapsulating a fill. Upon ingestion by the consumer (or on contact 
with water), moisture causes the capsule to come apart 
at the seams where the two halves are joined thereby 
releasing the fill or contents of the capsule. SGCs are generally prepared by one of two 
methods. The first method is known as the plate 
process. In this method, a set of molds is used. A 
warm sheet of gelatin is laid over a lower plate and 
the liquid fill is poured on it. A second sheet of 
gelatin is then placed on top followed by the top 
plate. The set is placed under pressure to form the 
desired capsule. The sheets of gelatin used to form 
the capsule may be colored or uncolored.  
 In 1933, Robert P. Scherer invented the rotary-die 
process. In this process, soft gelatin capsules are 
made by continuously casting two separate ribbons of 
molten or flowable gelatin into two separate rotating 
dies of an encapsulation machine to produce soft, 
elastic gelatin capsules. Dyes or other suitable 
coloring material can be added to the molten gelatin 
to produce soft gelatin capsules of various colors. 
In addition, if different dyes are added to the 
different molten gelatin masses then softgels with 
halves of different colors can be made. A more 
detailed description of the well known soft gelatin 
capsule art may be found in Ebert, "Soft Elastic 
Gelatin Capsules: A Unique Dosage Form," 
Pharmaceutical Technology, October 1977 and in "The 
Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy", Chapter 
13, Lachman et al., published by Lea and Febiger, 
1970. The rotary die process described in these 
references are incorporated herein by reference as 
being descriptive of the rotary die process to which

An apparatus for producing a patterned gelatin ribbon (58) useful for 
forming patterned soft gelatin capsules comprising, a first spreader box (40) adapted 

to hold a first flowable gelatin mass (42) and a second spreader box (44) adapted to 
hold a second f
lowable gelatin mass (46), the second gelatin mass (46) being of a 
type that is visually distinct from the first gelatin mass (42),
 
   the second spreader box (44) being positioned within the first spreader 

box (40) such that an outer surface (48) of the second spreader box (44) and an inner 
surface (50) of the first spreader box (40) define a gap (52) through which the first 

flowable gelatin mass (42) may flow to form a base gelatin ribbon (54),
 
   the second spreader box (44) having at least one opening (56) through 

which the second flowable gelatin mass (46) may flow onto a portion of the base 
gelatin ribbon (54) to form the patterned gelatin ribbon (58). 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the second spreader box (44) is a 
hollow tube. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the second spreader box (44) is 
movable with respect to the first spreader box (40). 
The apparatus of claim 3 additionally comprising a mover (62) capable 
of moving the second spreader box (44) relative to the first spreader box (40). 
The apparatus of claim 4 wherein the mover (62) is an oscillator. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the rate at which the second 
flowable gelatin mass (46) flows through the at least one opening (56) in the second 

spreader box (44) is controllable. 
The apparatus of claim 6 additionally comprising a pressurizer (63) 
adapted to increase the flow rate of the second flowable gelatin mass (46) through the 

at least one opening (56) in the second spreader box (44) by applying pressure to the 
second flowable gelatin mass (46). 
The apparatus of claim 1 in which the second spreader box (44) has 
a plurality of openings (56).  

 
The apparatus of claim 1 additionally comprising a third spreader box 
(64) adapted to hold a third flowable gelatin mass (66), said third gelatin mass (66) 

being of a type that is visually distinct from the first gelatin mass (42) and the second 
gelatin mass (46), the third spreader box (64) being positioned within the first 

spreader box (40) and having at least one opening (70) through which the third 
flowable gelatin mass (66) may flow onto a portion of the base gelatin ribbon (54) to 

form the patterned gelatin ribbon (58). 
A process for producing a patterned gelatin ribbon (58) useful for 
forming patterned soft gelatin capsules comprising the following steps: 


a. flowing a first gelatin mass (42) contained in a first spreader 
box (40) through a gap (52) formed by an inner surface (50) of the 

first spreader box (40) and an outer surface (48) of a second spreader 
box (44), the second spreader box (44) being positioned within the 

first spreader box (40), thereby forming a base gelatin ribbon (54); 
and 
b. flowing a second gelatin mass (46) contained in the second 
spreader box (44) through at least one opening (56) in the second 

spreader box (44) onto a portion of the base gelatin ribbon (54), the

plurality of spaced openings (56) such that stripes are formed on the patterned gelatin 

ribbon (58). 
The process of claim 13 wherein the second spreader box (44) is
