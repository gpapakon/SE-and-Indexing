<ABSTRACT>
A high capacity optical fiber network operative with wavelength 
division multiplexing. Contemplated systems can utilize span distances in excess of 

100km, signal amplification within spans (a span being defined at one end by a 
transmitter and at the other by a receiver), and provide plural multiplexed channels 

operative at multiple gigabits per second. The major portion of fiber defining the 
span has a chromatic dispersion having an absolute value in the range 1.5 to 4 

ps/nm-km at the system wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field addressed concerns high capacity optical fiber networks operative with wavelength division multiplexing. Systems contemplated: are based on span distances which exceed 100 kilometers; depend upon signal amplification rather than repeaters within spans, and use three or more multiplexed channels each operative at a minimum of 5.0gbits per second.The state of the art against which the present invention is considered is summarized in the excellent article, 'Dispersion-shifted Fiber', Lightwave, pp. 25-29, Nov. 1992. As noted in that article, most advanced optical fiber systems now being installed and in the planning stages depend upon dispersion-shifted fiber (DS fiber). A number of developments have led to a preference for a carrier wavelength at 1.55 µm. The loss minimum for the prevalent single-mode silica-based fiber is at this wavelength and the only practical fiber amplifier at this time ― the erbium amplifier operates best at this wavelength. It has been known for some time that the linear dispersion null point ― the radiation wavelength at which the chromatic dispersion changes sign and passes through zero ― naturally falls at about 1.31 µm for silica-based fiber. DS fiber ― fiber in which the dispersion null point is shifted to 1.55 µm ― depends upon balancing the two major components of chromatic dispersion; material dispersion and waveguide dispersion. Waveguide dispersion is adjusted by tailoring the fiber's index-of-refraction profile. Prior to this, correction of dispersion by concatenating fibers having dispersions of opposite sign was suggested, see EP-A-0 531 210 and FR-2 681 745.Use of DS fiber is expected to contribute to multi-channel operation ― to wavelength division multiplex (WDM). Here, multiple closely spaced carrier wavelengths define individual channels, each operating at high capacity ― at 5.0 gbit/sec or higher. Installation intended for WDM either initially or for contemplated upgrading uses three or more channel operation, each operating sufficiently close to the zero dispersion point and each at the same capacity. Contemplated systems are generally based on four or eight WDM channels each operating at or upgradable to that capacity.WDM systems use optical amplification rather than signal regeneration where possible. WDM becomes practical upon substitution of the optical amplifier for the usual repeater which depends upon electronic detection and optical regeneration. Use of the Er amplifier permits fiber spans of hundreds of kilometers between repeaters or
