<ABSTRACT>
What is specified is a device for forming a separating layer between individual ceramic mouldings (1) during the stacking of the mouldings, which can be flat crockery articles, such as dishes, plates or the like, and which can have a round and/or oval and/or angular shape. The separating layer between the individual ceramic articles (1; 6; 10; 14; 19; 23) is formed by separating sheets (29) made of a material which cannot or can only with difficulty be charged statically and which is resistant to temperature of up to 120@C. The separating sheets (29) are applied to form a separating layer by means of a metering device (3; 16) during the stacking of the articles. This separating layer formed from separating sheets (29) is then sucked off by means of a pneumatically working conveying device during unstacking or during the dismantling of the stack and is collected again in one or more receiving containers (13; 26; 27; 28), in order subsequently to be returned to the metering device (3; 16). This circulatory system works extremely efficiently and reliably as a result of the reuse of the separating sheets (29). Furthermore, corresponding feed and discharge devices (5; 18; 22; 9) during the stacking and unstacking of the ceramic mouldings are provided.

Device for forming a partition layer between 
individual ceramic moulded bodies when stacking 

unpolished earthenware and porcelain ware, such as 
dishes, plates or the like (shallow crockery), having 

round and/or square and/or oval shape, having a device 
(3; 16) for applying the partition layer during 

construction of a stack and a nozzle (8; 21) for removing 
the partition layer during construction of a stack, 

characterised by a metering device (3; 16), which 
sprinkles the small separating sheets (29) onto a moulded 

body to be provided with the partition layer, and by a 
suction nozzle (8; 21) which removes the separating 

sheets (29) forming the partition layer during 
construction of a stack and returns these separating 

sheets (29) for refilling the metering device (3; 16) via 
a receiver container (13; 26; 27; 28) for receiving the 

separating sheets (29). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
separating sheets (29) can be supplied in metered manner 

to the ceramic moulded body (1) by means of a distributor 
disc (3; 16) which is provided with a vibrator. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the 

shape of the distributor disc (3; 16) is matched to the 
shape of the ceramic moulded body. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
separating sheets (29) can be supplied in metered manner 

to the ceramic moulded body (1) by means of a rotating 
allocator disc (30). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that 
helical wipers (33) are assigned to the allocator disc 

(30).  
 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the distributor disc (3; 16) or the 

allocator disc (30) and an assigned stock container (2) 
are arranged fixedly and centrally over the stack of 

ceramic moulded bodies (1). 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the distributor disc (3; 16) or the 

allocator disc (30) and an assigned stock container (2) 
are arranged to be displaceable in conjunction with a 

receiver arm (4) and a dish receiver device (5). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the suction nozzle (8; 21) is 

arranged to be displaceable in conjunction with a 
receiver arm (7). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the suction nozzle (8; 21) and a 

dish receiver device (9) are arranged to be displaceable 
in conjunction with a common receiver arm (7). 
Device according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in 
that the suction nozzle (8; 21) and a conveying pipe (12; 

25) are connected by a movable suction hose (11; 24). 
Device according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the suction nozzle (8; 21), the suction hose (11; 24) and 

the conveying pipe (12; 25) form a suction device which 
is connected to a pneumatic conveyer and the receiver 

container (13; 26; 27; 28). 
Device according to claim 11, characterised in that 
the suction device comprising the suction nozzle (8; 21), 

the suction hose (11; 24) and the conveying pipe (12; 25) 
is connected to the pneumatic conveyer and a central 

receiver container (26).  
 
Device according to claim 12, characterised in that 
several stack construction stations (B) each having a 

suction nozzle (21) are connected to the pneumatic 
conveyer and the central receiver container (26). 
Device according to claim 12 or 13, characterised in 
that the pneumatic conveyer and the central receiver 

container (26) charge several stack construction stations 
(A), each having a receiver container (27), with 

separating sheets (29).
