<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention concerns a waterproof shoe and 
the related manufacturing process, involving two 

insoles, one to be sown to the edges of the lining, 
and the other, outside the first insole, to be sown to 

the edges of the vamp; it being provided that during 
the moulding phase of the bottom, the polyurethane be 

made to pass beyond the outermost insole in order that 
it infiltrates, collects and consolidates between the 

seams of the edges of the vamp and the lining, thereby 
creating a perimetral surround which insulates the two 

seams.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant patent application for an industrial 
invention concerns a manufacturing process for the 
production of waterproof shoes, of the type made up of 
a bottom in polyurethane moulded directly onto a vamp, 
which is fully lined in waterproof material. Protection provided by a patent must also extend to 
the shoe obtained by means of the manufacturing 
process according to the invention. The aim of the instant invention is to eliminate the 
problems encountered in shoes of the type in question, 
produced by means of current manufacturing techniques, 
which are not able to guarantee that the shoes be 
totally waterproof, in spite of the fact that the 
material used to this end is fully water repellent. In order to comprehend the cause of said problems, it 
will be necessary to describe the manufacturing 
process commonly used today to produce said waterproof 
shoes. First of all, it should be said that a lining is sewed 
inside the vamp, which is made of natural or synthetic 
material, this lining normally being made of soft, 
padded material, onto which a thin layer of water 
repellent material is applied on the outside, this 
being positioned therefore between the lining and the 
vamp, thereby insulating the former from the latter. The ling and the vamp thus pre-assembled are then 
submitted to the first processing phase, during which 
their lower edges, matching and one above the other, 
are simultaneously sewn to the edge of an insole.  Once this phase has been completed, the vamp, complete 
with insole, is fitted onto a metal form, which is an 
integral part of the equipment required for the 
moulding of the bottom and is of the same shape and 
dimensions of the foot to which the size of the fitted 
vamp corresponds. The finished shoe emerges from the moulding phase, 
fitted with a polyurethane bottom, which incorporates 
the insole and surrounds the sides of the vamp 
perimetrally and at the base. However, footwear manufactured in this manner is not 
able to guarantee that the foot is perfectly insulated 
against the possibility of water infiltration, in 
spite of the high level of water repellence of the 
material positioned between the lining and the vamp. This lack of reliability is due to the fact that the 
vamp is sewn directly onto the insole, therefore all 
the dampness absorbed by the vamp can reach the inside 
of the shoe, through the stitching and the holes of 
said seam, thereby bypassing the waterproof barrier 
provided by the water repellent material. The inventive idea at the

<CLAIMS>
1) Manufacturing process for the production of 
waterproof shoes, of the type made up of a 

polyurethane bottom (6), moulded directly onto a vamp 
(1), sewn to an inside lining (2), it being provided 

that water repellent canvas material (3) be previously 
positioned in between the two, characterised by the 

fact that it comprises the following operational 
phases: 


a) perimetral stitching of the lower edges (2a) of the 
lining (2) - covered by water repellent canvas (3) - 

to the edge of an insole (4); 
b) perimetral stitching of the lower edges (1a) of the 
vamp (1a) to the edge of an insole (5), which is 

perforated or made of material which melts on contact 
with the polyurethane injected into the mould; 
c) moulding of the bottom in polyurethane (6); 
 
it being provided that during the moulding phase of 

the bottom (6), the polyurethane passes beyond the 
insole (5), infiltrating between the fixing seams of 

the edges (1a and 2a) of the vamp and the lining, 
thereby creating a perimetral surround (7), which 

insulates the two seams. 
2) Manufacturing process for the manufacture of 
waterproof shoes, according to the previous claim, 

characterised by the fact that in a preferred form of 
embodiment, the insole (4) is undersized, and 

precisely, not as wide as the sole (5), which is of 
suitable dimensions to match the size of shoe being 

manufactured. 
3) Waterproof shoe, of the type made up of a 
polurethane bottom (6), moulded directly onto a vamp 

(1), sewn onto an inside lining (2), water repellent 
canvas material (3) having previously been positioned 

in between the two, characterised by the fact that it 
is manufactured according to the process described in 

the previous claims.
