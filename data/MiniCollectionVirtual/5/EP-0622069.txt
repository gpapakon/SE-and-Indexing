in concentration of 0,025mg/ml and of the adjuvans lactose, 
in concentration of 50mg/ml, in a solution of pH 5,9, which 

represents a pH region near the optimum pH of action of 
papain and 2) the enzyme chymotrypsin, in concentrations of 

1mg/ml to 0,1mg/ml in the presence of the stabilizers of 
enzyme activity dithiothreitol, in concentration of 1mg/ml, 

EDTA, in concentration of 0,025mg/ml and ethylene glycol in 
concentration of 0.2ml/ml and the adjuvans lactose, in 

concentration of 50mg/ml, in a solution of pH 7,4, which 
represents the pH region near the pH optimum of action of 

chymotrypsin, with the aim the application in permanent 
enzymic depilation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to depilatory preparations 
containing the proteolytic enzymes papain or chymotrypsin, 
with the aim of application, with the suitable method of 
ionization, for permanent enzymic depilation for all types 
of skin, ranging from dry, sensitive, to fatty, resistant 
ones. The up to now in use technic of permanent enzymic 
depilation is based on preparations containing papain, in 
concentrations not clearly defined, in the presence of 
glutathione, EDTA and propylene glycol, as stabilizers of 
enzymic activity. The not clearly defined concentration of 
the enzyme papain does not permit the differential 
application, depending on the peculiarities of each type of 
skin. No analogous research exists for the use of enzymic 
methods for depilation, with the exception of older work of 
Australian researchers on removal of the wool of sheep. The 
present invention introduces as depilatory preparation the 
enzyme papain, in concentrations selected for different skin 
types, in contrast to the up to now used preparations, with 
undefined concentrations of the enzyme. The present 
invention introduces also the use for the first time, as 
depilatory agent, the enzyme chymotrypsin, in concentrations 
selected for different skin types. The present invention 
introduces the use of dithiothreitol and ethylene glycol as 
stabilizers of enzyme activity, leading to improvement in 
comparison to the up to now in use stabilizers. In 
addition, the present invention refers to a method of  
 
depilation, which applies the preparations of the enzyme 
papain or the enzyme chymotrypsin for the depilation of any 
type of skin, in concentrations of 0,1mg/ml to 1mg/ml, as 
well as to the method of depilation which is based on the 
sequential application of the preparation papain, followed 
by that of the respective preparation which contains 
chymotrypsin, in concentrations of 0,1mg-1mg/ml, depending 
on the peculiarities of each skin type. The application of 
depilatory preparations which contain either papain, or 
chymotrypsin, or the sequential application first of the 
preparation containing papain, followed by the preparation 
containing chymotrypsin, is performed by the method of 
ionophoresis for suitable time periods and with suitable 
current intensities. Based on our own measurements the time 
period of application of ionophoresis is 1.5 to 2.5 min for 
each enzyme preparation and the intensity of current is 
1,5-2,5 mAmp, independent of the skin type. Our own 
observations showed that the
