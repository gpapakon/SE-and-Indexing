<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method, and a device for carrying out the method, for detecting oil dispersed in water. The object is to specify a method and a device for detecting oil dispersed in water, in which even the smallest quantities of oil in water can be recognised, it being intended to use the measurement to obtain a generally valid assessment of the condition of the water. The off-gases of the medium fed in, i.e. the waste or process water, are zonally closed off from the surroundings. The closed-off off-gases are then examined by means of a measuring probe with respect to the non-volatile hydrocarbon content.
