<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for tuning an evacuatable resonance chamber (1) in a resonator (2) comprising a piston (3) which can be introduced in a straight line in relation to an axis (4) from a secondary chamber (5) by means of a shifting device (6) holding it through an aperture (7) along the axis (4) into the resonance chamber (1). According to the invention, the device has a plurality of channels (8, 9) via each of which the resonance chamber (1) communicates with the secondary chamber (5). The invention meets both the requirements concerning a vaccum to be created in the resonance chamber (1) and the secondary chamber (5) and those concerning confining a resonant electromagnetic field in the resonance chamber (1) by simple means and is thus especially suitable for use in resonators (2) forming components of particle accelerator installations.
