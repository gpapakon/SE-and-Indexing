<ABSTRACT>
A weighted exercising garment (22) is formed in one piece of resilient flexible material so as to be a snug fit on the wearer's body. The garment comprises a central portion (40) around the wearer's torso, an upper portion (44) passing over the shoulders (24), and a lower portion (60) extending downwardly from the central portion and including portions that pass around the thighs (26). Packs of weights are attached to the upper portion at the front (70, 72) over the chest and over the upper back (74, 76), and further packs of weights are attached around the thighs (78, 80, 82, 84). The weights, in the form of packs (96) each having parallel pockets (97) with a respective plurality of individual weights (98), are removably attached by a curly pile loop and hook material such as VELCRO (RTM). The garment (22) forms part of a kit (20) which includes two arm weight carriers (30) worn around the wrists and two leg weight carriers worn around the calves (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a weighted exercising garment, for
use in exercising the human body as an aid to health and fitness.It is well established that weight training, or resistance
training, advances the performance of the body's muscle system,
strength and stamina. A multitude of weighted devices have been
developed for this purpose. For example, United States Patents
US-A-4 602 387 and 4 268 917 disclose loose-fitting vests with
pockets that can be filled with weights, and United States Patent
US-A-4 658 442 and United Kingdom Patent Application GB-A-2 129 281
show similar vests with weight-filled pockets which are made more
snugly fitting by horizontal straps that can be tightened on the
user.United States Patent US-A-4 382 302 describes a similar sort
of vest with horizontal straps which pass round the wearer's torso
and can be tightened to hold the vest snugly in contact with the
wearer's chest and back. A number of flat weights are attached as
desired to the front and back panels of the vest by the use of curly
pile loop and hook fastener material as sold under the registered
trade mark VELCRO. Thus weights can be added or removed as desired
for an individual's training schedule.United States Patent US-A-4 384 369 reverts to a loose
fitting exercise suit comprising a separate jacket and trousers
(pants), with numerous pockets which carry bags of liquid to provide
the desired weights. The pockets cover the torso, the arms from
shoulder to wrist, and the legs from crutch to ankle. It is stated
that instead of being formed as a two-piece suit, the suit may be
constructed as a one-piece jump suit. With this suit the user can
apparently carry up to of the order of 200lbs (90kg) weight, but
this amount distributed in the unplanned manner described would not
serve any useful exercising function, and would at the least be
unbearably uncomfortable and could be positively dangerous. To the present inventor's knowledge none of the above-mentioned
exercise garments have actually been satisfactory for
widespread use. Despite the plethora of pockets they do not
provide a distribution of weights which strengthens the
required muscles properly. Furthermore they are inconvenient
to wear as, despite measures purporting to inhibit it, they
still move around on the body and do not give the wearer the
confidence that they are going to stay put during hard physical
exercise. Finally, many of the garments are inelegant and out
of keeping with modern sports environments.United States Patent US-A-5010596 describes
