<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of synthesis of ω-hydroxy
fatty acid containing ceramides.It is well established that ceramides have a vital role in
the production and maintenance of the water permeability
barrier of the skin. Ceramides, or substances closely
related to them, have been widely disclosed as components
of skin care compositions.In particular EP 0 097 059 (Unilever) discloses the vital
role played by ω-linoleoyl ceramides in the water barrier
of the skin and describes the application for skin care of
such ω-linoleoyl ceramides.It is known in the art that skin ceramides (including ω-hydroxy
fatty acid containing ceramides) may be extracted
from mammalian stratum corneum cells.It has been proposed for example in US 3,660,566 (Lever
Brothers Company), to extract animal stratum corneum from
epidermis and then separate the stratum corneum into a
lipid-rich fraction and a cellular fraction, and then to
employ the lipid-rich fraction in cosmetic compositions.It is also proposed in GB 2 178 312 (Kao Corporation) to
extract lipids from horny cells of mammals such as the pig,
and then to employ the lipid so extracted in cosmetic
compositions which are useful for treating dry skin
conditions in man. However, to extract ω-hydroxy fatty acid containing
ceramides in high enough levels for incorporation into
skin care products causes problems. Furthermore it is
undesirable for the source of the cosmetic ingredient to
be from animals.Synthetic Pseudo-ceramides have also been widely disclosed
in the literature, for example by Kao Corporation in EP 0
227 994 which discloses synthetic analogues of ceramides
which have some similar properties to natural ceramides
but which are relatively cheaper to produce. However, the
degree of skin benefit attributable to such analogues is
limited to the extent that they do not fully mimic the
natural ceramides of the skin.EP 0398272 (Kao Corporation) provides novel amide
derivatives and dermatologic preparations containing such
novel amide derivatives. The amides are intended to
improve the barrier function of the skin. The amides can
be synthesised via a number of different processes.It is therefore desirable to be able to synthesise
naturally-occurring ω-hydroxy fatty acid containing
ceramides using a synthesis route, which is not too
expensive, to allow the possibility of the synthesised
ceramides being incorporated at functional levels into
cosmetic compositions.Accordingly, the invention provides:A method of synthesising an ω-hydroxy fatty acid
containing ceramide
