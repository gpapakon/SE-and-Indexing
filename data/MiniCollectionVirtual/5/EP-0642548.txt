<ABSTRACT>
An electrical grade polyvinyl chloride resin composition suitable for use as an electrical insulation material and avoiding the use of lead based stabilizers having a high volume resistivity when exposed to or immersed in water and a high resistance to deterioration when heated at temperatures above 100  DEG C is disclosed. The composition is composed of an electrical grade polyvinyl chloride resin, filler, carboxylic acid ester plasticizer, at least one heat stabilizer from which cadmium and lead are substantially excluded, and as a wet resistivity agent protecting against the effective of water, a defined amount of at least one alkaline earth metal oxide or hydroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to polyvinyl
chloride resin compositions used in formulation of
electrical grade wire and cable insulation materials.
Such compositions usually contain, in addition to an
electrical grade polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, one or
more plasticizers in order to render the composition
flexible, a lubricant to assist in processing, one or
more fillers, and one or more stabilizers. Such PVC
compositions have a 50 years or more history of
successful use world-wide, based on the ability of PVC
manufacturers to provide electrical grade PVC resins
having a high electrical resistivity, and on the
discovery that certain lead compounds were outstanding
stabilizers for such electrical grade PVC resins and
thus afforded electrical grade PVC resin compositions
characterized by excellent heat stability permitting
rapid and economical processing at high temperatures
without materially reducing electrical resistivity as
measured by volume resistivity. Lead salts
conventionally used as stabilizers in such PVC 
compositions well before 1960 and still used currently
include inorganic lead salts, such as lead carbonate,
lead orthosilicate, coprecipitated lead orthosilicate
and silicate, tribasic lead sulfate, dibasic lead
phosphate, white lead (mixture of the carbonate and
hydroxide), lead salts of organic acids such as lead
stearate, dibasic lead stearate, lead maleate, lead
fumarate, lead tartrate, lead salicylate, dibasic lead
phthalate, lead palmitate, lead laureate, lead abietate
and the like; and commercial mixtures of neutral and
basic salts such as are prepared by fusing together lead
oxide and a suitable organic acid such as stearic,
salicylic etc. A detailed description of electrical
grade PVC resins and specifications therefor, and of
compounding ingredients used therewith in formulating
electrical grade PVC resin compositions, such as
plasticizers, lubricants, and fillers, can be found in
Brecker et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,447,569 issued May 6,
1984 and need not be repeated here.A serious drawback to the use of lead based
stabilizers in electrical PVC compositions in spite of
their outstanding characteristics in manufacture and use
is the toxic and hazardous property of nearly every
known lead compound. These hazards have long been a
concern in the maintenance of safe working conditions
where such stabilizers are manufactured and used in
compounding electrical grade PVC compositions, and have
been addressed by various techniques for altering the
physical condition of powdery lead based
