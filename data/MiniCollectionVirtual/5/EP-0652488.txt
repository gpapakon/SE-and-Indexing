<ABSTRACT>
Polymers suitable for chemically amplified resists based on styrene 
chemistry are advantageously formed with a meta substituent on the phenyl ring of 

the styrene moiety. Additionally, polymers for such applications including, but not 
limited to, meta substituted polymers are advantageously formed by reacting a first 

monomer having a first protective group with a second monomer having a second 
protective group. After polymerization, the second protective group is removed 

without substantially affecting the first protective group. For example, if the first 
protective group is an alkoxy carbonyl group, and the second protective group is a 

silyl ether group, treatment with a lower alcohol with trace amounts of acid 
transforms the silyl group into an OH-moiety without affecting the alkoxy carbonyl 

group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lithographic processes, and in particular, to
lithographic processes involving device fabrication.Lithographic processes are typically employed in the manufacture of
devices such as semiconductor devices. That is, a material, i.e., a resist, that is
sensitive to the exposing radiation is coated onto a substrate, e.g., a silicon wafer that
is being processed to form a plurality of devices. The coating material is (if desired)
baked, subjected to spatially discrete radiation, e.g., light that has been passed
through a mask material, or a controlled particle (e.g., electron) beam, so that the
radiation reaching the resist corresponds to a desired pattern that is to be transferred
into the underlying substrate, and then, if desired, post-exposure baked before
development of the pattern.Resist materials, including a polymer having a protective group, have
been described in U.S. Patent 4,812,542, dated March 14, 1989. The protective
group present in these materials is employed in the synthesis process to prevent
undesired reactions during formation of the resist material. Such protective groups,
since they are not involved in the operation of the resist, are removed before or after
exposure throughout the resist material by heating. Thus, for example, in a
synthesized polymer, such as poly(4-tert-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene-co-o-nitro-Î±-methylbenzyl
methacrylate), the tert-butoxycarbonyl protective group is removed to
leave a hydroxyl substituent. This substituent then performs the function of
providing an acid moiety that after exposure and bake provides alkaline solubility to
the exposed regions. The protective group, however, is not involved in producing
the desired pattern.Among the lithographic processes that are available to expose resists
having protective groups, photolithography is often utilized. Photolithographic
processes have the advantage of being suitable for a blanket exposure technique, i.e.,
the entire wafer is exposed simultaneously. A blanket exposure is advantageous
because it is relatively fast compared to other methods such as the raster scan
technique usually employed when the energy used to expose the resist is a beam of
electrons. However, generally, resolution obtainable through a blanket exposure
with near ultraviolet or visible light is somewhat poorer than that achieved with
other methods such as electron lithography. Improved resolution with a blanket exposure is achievable by using deep
ultraviolet or X-ray light. X-ray exposure generally has a potential

<CLAIMS>
A process for fabricating a device comprising the steps of applying to
a device substrate a polymer having a multiplicity of first pendant substituents with a

first protective group and a multiplicity of second pendant substituents patternwise
exposing said polymer to radiation to induce removal of said first protective group to

form a latent image, developing said image, and using the resulting pattern towards
completion of said device, characterised in that second protective groups protecting

said second substituents are removed to leave said multiplicity of second pendant
substituents before said exposure.
The process of claim 1 wherein said second protective group is chosen
from the group consisting of trimethysilyl, triethylsilyl, dimethylsilyl,

dimethylpropylsilyl, dimethylisopropylsilyl, and dimethyl-t-butylsilyl.
The process of claim 2 wherein said first protective group is a
t-butoxycarbonyl group.
The process of claim 1 wherein said first protective group is a
t-butoxycarbonyl group.
The process of claim 1 wherein said polymer includes pendant phenyl
rings.
The process of claim 5 wherein said phenyl ring is meta substituted
with said first or said second protective group.
The process of claim 1 wherein said second protective groups are
removed before said applying to a device substrate.
