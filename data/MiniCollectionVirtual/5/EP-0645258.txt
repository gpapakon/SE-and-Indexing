<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing machine having a cartridge (2) which contains a ribbon (7) and has two rotatably mounted cores (25,26,27,28) which are arranged with lateral spacing in a housing (18,19), the ribbon (7) being uncoiled from the one core (26), being moved past a print head (16) and being coiled onto the other core (28), and a through-bore (50) for inserting a receiving pin (52) of the printing machine (1) being formed on the housing (18,19). In order to be able to adjust the position of the ribbon (7) in an improved manner, it is proposed that the housing (18,19) bears against an adjusting ring (54) which can be displaced and fixed on the receiving pin (52). Alternatively or additionally it is recommended that a projecting guide plate (56) for the free strand (15) of the ribbon (7) is mounted pivotably on the housing (18,19), and that the length of the projecting cartridge arms (20,21) of the housing (18,19) is greater than that of the guide plate (56).

A cartridge (2) which can be fitted into a printer and which
contains a ribbon (7), having a casing (18, 19)


which is provided with two cartridge arms (20, 21), at the free ends
of each of which is provided a respective deflection element (13, 14) for the

free run (15) of the ribbon (7), and wherein a guide plate (56) for the
ribbon (7), which projects forwardly beyond the casing (18, 19), is secured

to the cartridge arm (21) which is associated with the tube (28) on to
which the ribbon (7) is wound,
in which casing there are arranged two rotatably mounted tubes
(25, 26, 27, 28) which are arranged at a lateral spacing, wherein the ribbon

(7) is unwound from the one tube (26), guided past a print head (16)
arranged between the free run (15) of the ribbon (7) and the cartridge (2),

and wound on to the other tube (28),
and on which casing there is provided a through bore (50) for
insertion of a mounting pin (52) of the printer (1),

characterised in that the guide plate (56) is mounted azimuthally
pivotably on the casing (18, 19) and that the length of the cartridge arms

(20, 21) is greater than that of the guide plate (56).
A cartridge according to claim 1 characterised in that in a pivoted-back
position the guide plate (56) projects at most laterally beyond the

housing (18, 19).
A cartridge according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the cartridge (2) can be introduced when the guide plate (56) is pivoted

back.
A cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that
in the case of a reversible cartridge a guide plate (56) is or can be

associated with each deflection element (13, 14). 
A cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the guide plate (56) is removable and can be fitted on to the oppositely

disposed deflection element (13 or 14).
A cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the casing of the cartridge (2) substantially comprises two casing halves

(18, 19), between which the tubes (25, 26, 27, 28) are arranged.
A cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that
the through bore (50) is formed by the bore in a mounting tube (51) which

is fitted into an aperture in a casing half (19).
A cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that
the through bore (50) is arranged on a transverse plane of symmetry (58)

of the cartridge (2) and is disposed at a cartridge end (49) while deflection
elements (13, 14; 22, 23) for the free run (15) of the ribbon are arranged

at the opposite end of the cartridge (2).
A cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that
the usable width of a print line of the print head (16) and/or the guides for

a recording carrier is greater than the width of the ribbon (7), in particular
a multiple thereof.
