<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to processes for manufacture of substantially dust-free particles of enzymes by spray-coating solid particulate cores or seeds with fermentation broths containing enzymes. Fermentation broths containing from 5 % to 100 % total solids as enzyme and 4 % - 55 % total solids content in the broth may be used. For broths containing 4 % - 31 % total solids, enzyme and coating agents may be spray-coated so as to achieve a weight gain of 1 % - 24 % w/w over the initial weight of the cores. For broths with 31 % - 55 % total solids, a corresponding weight gain of 1 % - 100 % may be achieved. The enzyme coated cores may be further coated with coating agents. The total dry weight added to the cores ranges from 1 % to 19 % in the absence of coating agents and 1 % to 24 % in the presence of coating agents when the lower range of total solids content is used. The total dry weight added to the cores ranges from 1 % to 100 % when the higher range of total solids content is used. These conditions are especially useful in the granulation of enzymes with very high specific activities, so that effective enzyme activity can be provided by adding low amounts of broth solids to the cores. Reduction in added solids is of significant economic benefit in reducing granulation costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR DUST-FREE ENZYME MANUFACTUREField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a novel procedure for making dry and dust-free enzyme granules from a fermentation broth containing the enzyme.Background of the InventionMany commercially useful enzymes are produced by microorganisms, particularly bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi. These enzymes are especially useful in detergent and food applications. For example, enzymes useful in detergent applications, such as proteases, a ylases. Upases, and cellulases, have been produced in a wide variety of microbial hosts. When enzymes are produced in a microbial host they are usually either secreted directly into the fermentation broth by the microorganism or released into the fermentation broth by lysing the cell. The enzyme can then be recovered from the broth in a soluble form by a number of techniques including filtration, centrifugation, membrane filtration, chromatography.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 and the like. The dissolved enzyme can be converted to a dry form from a liquid using techniques such as precipitation, crystallization, or spray-drying. A problem associated with dry enzyme preparations is that there is a high dust level associated with them, which can cause dermatologic distress to the manufacturer, consumer, or any other person handling the enzyme. It has been a desire in the art to treat these dry enzymes so as to reduce the hazard of dusting. To control dusting and increase particle size, dry enzymes are often granulated by various means known by those skilled in the art. Various enzyme formulations and processes for these preparations have been developed in an effort to alleviate the dusting problem. For example, German Patent No. 21 37 042 discloses a process in which an extrudable enzyme containing formulation is extruded through a die onto the revolving plate of a spheronizing device to form spherical particles of the enzyme-containing formulations which are optionally coated with a material designed to prevent dusting.In U.S. Pat. No. 4,087,368, there is disclosed an enzyme granule formulation in which rods or spheres of an enzyme in admixture with magnesium alkyl sulfate and ethylene oxide are provided.U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,040 discloses a method for the preparation of free-flowing substantially dust-free, spherical enzyme-containing beads prepared by blending a powderedSUBSTITUTE SHEET
