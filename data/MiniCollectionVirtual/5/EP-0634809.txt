<ABSTRACT>
Waveguide antenna comprising a waveguide (1) in one wall 
(6) of which a number of transversal slots (2) are 

arranged. In connection with the transversal slots (2), 
electrically conducting waveguide elements (8) are arranged 

which are located parallel to the waveguide wall (6) and 
substantially symmetrically with respect to the transversal 

slots (2). In this way new slots (4, 9) are formed at the 
ends of the waveguide elements (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waveguide antenna with
transversal slots according to the preamble of claim 1.Within the microwave range and higher frequency ranges
various types of antennas are used. The slot antenna is
such a type of antenna where slots constitute the radiating
elements of the antenna. The radiating elements/slots are
fed by means of various forms of transmission lines such as
waveguides, strip-lines etc. Among other things, the
characteristics of the antenna are affected by the location
and the design of the slots and the radiation pattern of
the antenna is defined by the interaction between the
slots.In its most simple form a slot antenna may consist of a
waveguide in the wide side of which a number of longitudinal
slots is arranged. The length of the slot is = λ0/2
where λ0 is the wavelength in free space and the slots are
located with a pitch of λg/2 where λg is the wavelength in
the waveguide.In this type of slot antennas, the feeding of the slots is
controlled by them being displaced sideways from the
waveguide centre line. Alternating sideways displacement
results in the 180° phase correction which is necessary for
the slots to radiate with the same mutual phase in spite of
the location at the distance λg/2.An advantage with the slot location is that no grating
lobes are generated because the distance between the slots
is less than one wavelength. However, in certain applications an antenna with the
opposite direction of polarization is wanted. This is
possible with transversal slots, i.e. slots which are
placed across the longitudinal direction of the waveguide.
However, in this case the earlier mentioned possibility to
switch the phase by sideways displacement is lacking. The
transversal slots must therefore be arranged with the
mutual distance λg. This results in considerable grating
lobes because normally λg > λ0 (typically λg ≈ 1,4λ0).The grating lobes can be suppressed in various ways. For
example, in the Swedish patent application SE 9000959-8 a
method to suppress grating lobes by means of baffles is
described. Another way to achieve the same purpose is to
fill the waveguide with a dielectric material with ε > 2.
Both the methods have their limitations and are therefore
sometimes less suitable.Transversal slots in waveguides also have a high equivalent
impedance (R). For normal height of the waveguide, R/Z0 ≈
1 (where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the
waveguide) is valid, but for so-called half-height twice
that value, i.e. R/Z0 ≈ 2, is achieved. As the
