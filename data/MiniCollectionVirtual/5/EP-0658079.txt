<ABSTRACT>
EMF shielding is provided for a logic board (13) 
having a number of integrated circuit units 

(30,35,38,40,32) surface mounted to the logic board (13). 
The logic board is a laminate of a number of circuit 

layers. The integrated circuits surface mounted to the 
top circuit layer are a microprocessor (30), a number of 

memory units and an application specific integrated 
circuit surface. Additional circuit components are 

mounted to both the top and bottom circuit layers. 
Electrical lines provide electrical communication 

perpendicularly between the circuit layers and 
horizontally on the surface of the respective layers to 

and from the integrated circuits. The top circuit layer 
has a conductive material (19) formed contiguously around 

the integrated circuits mounted to the top layer of the 
logic board (13) and a top cover composed of EMF 

shielding material is fixably mounted to the logic board 
(13) to enclose the integrated circuits mounted to the 

top layer of the logic board (13). The periphery of the 
top cover is in contiguous contact with the conductive 

material (19). In like manner, the bottom circuit layer 
has a conductive material formed contiguously around the 

integrated circuits mounted to the bottom layer of the 
logic board and a bottom cover composed of EMF shielding 

material fixably mounted to the logic board to enclose 

the integrated circuits mounted to the bottom layer of 
the logic board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electro-magnetic 
field (EMF) shielding and, more particularly, EMF 
shielding of the main logic board for a processing 
system, for example, a postage meter mailing machine and 
like systems. It is conventional in envelope mail processing 
systems to define a unique microprocessor based system 
controller and EMF shielding for each system model. This 
conventional practice has been followed in order to 
accommodate the varying control requirements and power 
supply requirements between system models. Variations in 
the control system configuration and power supply 
required to communicate, e.g., the number and size of 
drive motors and other device modules such as the display 
size and type, have necessitated developing unique EMF 
shielding for each processing system. It is an objective of the present invention to 
present a main logic board configuration and modular EMF 
shielding therefor. It is a further objective of the present invention 
to present a main logic board configuration and modular 
shielding therefor. According to one aspect of the invention, there is 
provided an EMF shielding arrangement for a logic board 
having a plurality of integrated circuit units surface 
mounted to said logic board, characterised by, said logic 
board being a laminate of a plurality of circuit layers 
having a top circuit layerand a bottom circuit layer, 
said integrated circuit units being surface mounted to 
the top surface of said top circuit layer, said circuit 
layers and to said bottom circuit layers, electrical 
communication means for providing electrical 
communication perpendicularly between said circuit layers 
and on the surface of said respective layers to and from  
 
said integrated circuit units, said top circuit layer 
having a conductive material formed around said 
integrated circuits mounted to the top layer of said 
logic board, and a top cover composed of EMF shielding 
material fixably mounted to the logic board to enclose 
said integrated circuits mounted to the top layer of said 
logic board and having said conductive material in 
contiguous contact, said logic board having a plurality 
of buffers in bus communication with a coupler located 
outside of said top cover. For a better understanding of the invention and to 
show the same may be carried into effect, reference will 
now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:
