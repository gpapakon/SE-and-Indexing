<ABSTRACT>
Prepn. of an aqueous coating agent during the recycling of paint sludge. One part of freshly obtained paint sludge with a water content of 10-50 wt.% is processed by shearing with 0.15-0.6 pts. wt. of a mixture of (a) one or more organic solvents with a water solubility at 20 deg.C of above 500 g per litre of water (b) one or more organic solvents with a water solubility at 20 deg.C of below 500 g per litre of water (c) one or more amines and/or aminoalcohols (d) opt. one or more of the usual paint additive surfactants. Mixing is either with the total amount of components at once, or by first mixing with (a) followed by (b), (c) and opt. (d). Then 0.4-1.5 pts. wt. of the homogenised mixture is added to one part of an aqueous paint concentrate having an aq. binder dispersion with a minimum film-forming temperature of below 10 deg.C and a solids content of above 40 wt.%. Also claimed is the aq. coating agent produced by the process, and the use of the agent as a coating in the automobile paint industry and as a protective coating.

A process for producing aqueous coating media with the re-utilisation of lacquer sludge,
characterised in that


A) one part by weight of freshly obtained lacquer sludge which has a water content of
10 to 50 % by weight is incorporated, with shearing, in
B) 0.15 to 0.6 parts by weight of a mixture comprising

B1) one or more organic solvents with a solubility in water at 20°C which is greater
than 500 g per litre of water,
B2) one or more organic solvents with a solubility in water at 20°C which is less than
500 g per litre of water, namely alcohols, glycol ethers, glycol ether esters and/or

glycol esters,
B3) one or more amines and/or amino alcohols, and
B4) optionally one or more customary lacquer wetting agents,

wherein homogenisation by shearing is effected either in component B) as a whole or is first
effected in component B1) with the subsequent addition of components B2), B3) and

optionally B4),

whereupon

0.4 to 1.5 parts by weight of the homogenised mixture of components A) and B) is
incorporated in
C) one part by weight of an aqueous lacquer concentrate based on an aqueous binder
vehicle dispersion which has a minimum film-forming temperature of less than

10°C and a solids content of greater than 40 % by weight.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that component B) contains 45 to 70 % by
weight of solvent component B1), 30 to 50 % by weight of solvent component B2), 1 to 5

% by weight of amine or amino alcohol component B3), and 0 to 3 % by weight of wetting
agent component B4).
A process according to either one of the preceding claims, characterised in that Nmethylpyrrolidone,
dimethylformamide, alcohols and/or glycol ethers are used as solvent

component B1).
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that N-methylpyrrolidone, or glycol ethers
which are unrestrictedly soluble in water, is used as solvent component B1).
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that lacquer
concentrate C) is based on polyurethanes, (meth)acrylic copolymers, styrene-acrylic

copolymers and/or styrene-butadiene copolymers as binder vehicles.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that shearing is
effected by intensive mixing or stirring.
An aqueous coating medium obtained by the process according to any one of claims 1 to 6.
The use of the coating media according to claim 7 for the production of coatings in the
motor vehicle sector.
The use of the coatings according to claim 7 as an under-floor protection material.
