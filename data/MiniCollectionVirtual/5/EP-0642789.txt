<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition
for use in glaucoma treatment that is virtually free from
side effects, stable, and can develop improved intraocular
pressure reducing activity at low concentrations.Glaucoma is a disease characterized by an abnormal
increase in intraocular pressure which provokes a variety
of symptoms, such as fatigability in the eye, blurred
vision, pain in the eye and gradually impaired vision,
eventually leading to the risk of loss of vision. The
disease causes the eyeball to harden like stone or the
depth of the pupil to look green.Inside the eyeball a watery fluid (the aqueous humor)
circulates invariably to maintain a constant pressure
within the eye (intraocular pressure = 15 to 20 mmHg; 2.0
to 2.7 kPa). The aqueous humor is controlled by the
circulation of blood or lymph, resilience of the eyeball
wall, action of the dominant nerve etc., and when any of
such factors becomes abnormal, intraocular pressure rises
and glaucoma develops.When such abnormality is caused by ophthalmic diseases
such as iritis, wounds and hemorrhage in the vitreous body,
the resultant disease is called secondary glaucoma.
However, the usual type of glaucoma is primary glaucoma in
which the abnormality is brought about by unknown causes. Primary glaucoma is classified into three types:
(1) inflammatory glaucoma whose progress is acute, (2)
simple glaucoma whose progress is chronic and (3)
congenital glaucoma.In order to treat glaucoma, heretofore, various
medicaments have been used with the specific aim of
preventing a rise in intraocular pressure or reducing
increased intraocular pressure. The intraocular pressure
reducing agents known so far include the sympathomimetic
drugs such as epinephrine, but epinephrine, with its
mydriatic activity prompts angle closure when applied to
narrow angle glaucoma, thus possibly causing a rapid
increase in intraocular pressure and often producing an
increase in blood pressure and pigmentation in the
conjunctiva.The parasympathomimetic drugs such as pilocarpine,
with their miotic activity, bring about the sensation of
darkness or accommodation abnormality in the visual field.In recent years, furthermore, β-adrenergic blocking
agents such as timolol, by virtue of their suppressory
effect against production of aqueous humor, have been
extensively used for the treatment of glaucoma (Drug
Therapy Practical Series, The Drug Treatment of Glaucoma,
pp. 70 to 75, 1990). Nevertheless, such β-adrenergic
blocking agents, which have been reported to cause
