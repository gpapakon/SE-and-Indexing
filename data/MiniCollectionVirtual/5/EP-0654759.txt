<ABSTRACT>
A printer comprises an input unit for inputting 
color page description information, creation means for 

creating intermediate information for recording by 
analyzing color page description information which has 

been input, an execution unit for executing fast 
hardware rendering with a hardware for the intermediate 

information, and a switch for switching the fast 
hardware rendering into a software rendering in the 

case of a high grade color logical drawing which can 
not be supported by the hardware.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color
printing apparatus, and more particularly to a printing
apparatus and method for printing color data useful in
the multimedia processing for the CAD (Computed Aided
Design), CG (Computer Graphics), design, and color DTP
(Desk Top Publishing) in the business, etc., at high
resolution and high gradation.With the advent of intelligent work stations or
personal computers in recent years, the environment in
which the handling of characters, graphics or image
data in full color is easily made has been prepared.
As a result, the color information has been utilized in
a broad field for document with color, OHP (Over Head
Projector), slide, art, or design.In this way, applications with color
information on the host computer have been useful over
the broad field. However, in recording the color
information created on the host computer into the
printing apparatus, it is conventionally common to rely
on the utilization form of what is called a dumb
printer or video printer of expanding characters,
images and graphics into the image in accordance with 
the resolution of recording apparatus, on the host
side, using a CPU power (process function) of the host
computer, and then transferring the image to the color
printer. This processing system has the feature of
simplifying a mechanism on the printer side and
performing many processes on the host side, but in
handling the color information, has a problem that it
takes more time to make the communication due to a
great amount of data thereof, resulting in
significantly lower throughput.On the other hand, in the black-and-white
printers, it is common to rely on a method, referred to
as a page description language (hereinafter abbreviated
as PDL) method, of creating the page image in such a
way as to send characters, graphics and images as the
language from the host side, interpreting the PDL
language in the printer, and scan converting various
types of information into a raster memory corresponding
to the resolution of the printer. Color PDL printers
to which this scan system is applied have recently come
into wide use.However, in the color PDL printers, a language
architecture (structure) of conventional black-and-white
PDL printers is followed, in which the operation
such as SET, OR or XOR is performed bit by bit between
the information (destination) already rendered for
black-and-white or 1 bit information, and the 
information (source) of graphics, images and characters
subsequently rendered. But in the color printers, each
of
