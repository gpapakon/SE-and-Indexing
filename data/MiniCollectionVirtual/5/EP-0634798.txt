<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device with a semiconductor 
body (1) comprising a surface region (3) of a first conductivity type which adjoins a 

surface and in which a field effect transistor is provided which comprises a channel 
region (7) with a gate electrode (8) above it, and a source region (4), a drain region (5) 

and a drain extension region (6). The drain extension region (6) serves to improve the 
drain breakdown voltage of the field effect transistor. In practice, a high breakdown 

voltage is accompanied by a comparatively high on-resistance of the transistor. 
According to the invention, the drain extension region (6) has a geometry 
different from that in known transistors, 
i.e
. the drain extension region (6) comprises a 
number of zones (25) of the second conductivity type which extend from the channel 

region (7) to the drain region (5) and which have a width (26) and doping concentration 
such that, when the voltage difference across the blocked pn junction (28) between the 

surface region (3) and the drain extension region (6) is increased, the drain extension 
region (6) is fully depleted at least locally before drain breakdown occurs.

 
The measure according to the invention renders it possible to choose the number and the 

width (26) of the zones (25) as an additional parameter of the device. It is a surprise to 
find that devices according to the invention have comparatively high drain breakdown 

voltages and comparatively low on-resistances which cannot be realised with a 
continuous drain extension region (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device with a semiconductor 
body comprising a surface region of a first conductivity type which adjoins a surface 
and in which a field effect transistor with insulated gate is provided, with source and 
drain regions of the second, opposed conductivity type in the surface region and a drain 
extension region of the second conductivity type which adjoins the drain region and the 
surface, which has a lower doping concentration than the drain region, and which 
extends longitudinally in the direction of the source region, with a channel region of the 
first conductivity type situated between the drain extension region and the source 
region, and with a gate electrode situated above the channel region and separated from 
the channel region by an insulating layer. Such a semiconductor device is particularly useful as a switching element 
at high voltages, for example, for applications in motorcars, TV sets and audio power 
amplifiers. European Patent no. 69429 discloses a device of the kind mentioned in the 
opening paragraph. In this device, a drain extension region of the same conductivity 
type as but with a lower doping concentration than the strongly doped drain region is 
provided between the gate electrode and the comparatively strongly doped drain region. 
The surface region is electrically interconnected with the source region. Starting from a 
certain drain voltage, i.e. the voltage between source and drain regions, when the pn 
junction between the surface region and the drain extension region is blocked, the drain 
extension region is pinched off owing to an expansion of a depletion zone from the 
blocked pn junction, whereby the surface field strength at the side of the drain region is 
reduced and the voltage between the source and drain regions at which breakdown takes 
place, the so-called drain breakdown voltage, is increased. Although high drain breakdown voltages can be achieved in this manner, 
a high breakdown voltage is accompanied in practice by a comparatively high source-drain 
resistance, i.e. the on-resistance (Ron) of the transistor is high. This is because  
 
only a comparatively weak doping of the drain extension region will lead to a sufficient 
depletion of the drain extension region. This weak doping, however, leads to a high 
resistance of the drain extension region. In practice, moreover, an additional doping 
step is often necessary for providing the desired weak doping in the drain extension 
region. Such an additional doping
