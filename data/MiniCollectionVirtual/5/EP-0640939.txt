<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a transponder which can only be 
programmed by an authorized user. 
It includes a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) generator which checks 
during a WRITE function the data that is received from the reading/Writing 

(R/W) unit and also generates several protection bits (Block Check Character; 
BCC) which are sent back during the response function (READ). Before the 

CRC generator checks the data during a WRITE function, however, it must 
be set to a predetermined start value called a Segment Code of the 

transponder in order for a Write (or a READ) to be performed. Furthermore, 
a Selective Addressing function is provided. The programming of the 

Selective Address must be done within a predetermined time window (has a 
predetermined Time Code). If either the Selective Address or the BCC 

generated by the CRC generator is incorrect, the transponder can be 
discharged such that it will not respond. In addition, if the R/W unit detects 

that the Selective Address is being programmed at a time other than the 
predetermined Time Code, the reader makes the transponder inoperative in 

yet another way.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention describes a 
battery-less transponder and a method for providing a signal 
for transmission in response to a received RF signal comprising at 
least a Selective Address. RE-ID systems in the past, with may use battery-less or passive 
transponders, which depend upon the rectification of the interrogation signal 
for power, have mainly been comprised of transponders with read-only 
capability. The transponders were constrained in size, to facilitate 
implantation, for example, in animals, and in cost to keep manufacture 
expenses at a minimum. However, the applications for RF-ID systems 
continued to grow and with it, technical demands for a better, more improved 
RF-ID system. One major improvement to the existing RF-ID systems, was the 
implementation of a Read-Write transponder. With Read/Write capability, 
numerous applications arose such as airline baggage tracking, warehouse 
goods tracking and assembly line piece part tracking. One growing area of 
interest in Read-Write applications is in security access and toll applications 
which require remote Read and Programming (Write) functionality.  
 A transponder arrangement with a contactless selective read 
and selective programming function is known from 
US-A-5,053,774. The transponder arrangement comprises an 
interrogation unit for communicating with cooperating 
responder units, wherein at least one interrogation signal 
transmitted by a transmitter of the interrogation unit is 
modulated to include a specific address of one or more of a 
plurality of responder units to enable only selected 
responder units having an address corresponding to the 
address included in the interrogation signal to react to the 
reception of the interrogation signal with the return of a 
modulated carrier wave having data provided therein to the 
interrogation unit. The responder unit includes a 
demodulator circuit for receiving the at least one 
interrogation signal from the interrogation unit and 
determining the address provided therein and a data 
processor enabling the responder unit to send back the 
stored data to the interrogation unit in response to a 
comparison between the address as determined by the 
demodulator circuit with the address stored in the responder 
unit establishing identity of the compared addresses.  
 
Remote 
Read and Programming transponders are, however, prone to being tampered 
with due to the potential gain of succeeding, i.e. unauthorized access to a 
secure area or free passage through a toll booth. Data security
