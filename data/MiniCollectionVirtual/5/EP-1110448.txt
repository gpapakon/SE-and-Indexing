<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fishline twist correcting
device for correcting a fishline twist, and to a fishing rod
to which the fishline twist correcting device is mounted.In recent years, a fishing rod having a reel is used at
the time of fishing because it is more convenient. A rotating
direction of such a reel is a constant direction and thus, a
fishline is prone to have a curling habit or core set. If the
fishline has the curling habit, twist is generated in the
fishline, the twist is not easily and thus, there are various
problems. For example, while an angler is untying a twisted
portion of a fishline, the angler may loose the best catching
time and may be disappointed. There is a problem that natural
environment is destroyed, e.g., some angler may cut and remove
the twisted portion and dispose of the cut portion which becomes
scrap and contaminates a fishing spot, and the disposed fishline
twines bird's or beast's foot and may kill the bird or beast.Thereupon, in order to produce a fishline which is less
prone to be twisted, there are proposed a fishing rod provided
with a plurality of guide rings from a tip end of the rod and 
a reel, and a fishing rod so-called hollow rod through which
a fishline passes. Further, a reel having a twist correcting
device is developed.However, the fishing rod and the reel are not provided
means for correcting the curling habit of the fishline.
Therefore, if the fishing rod and the reel are used several tens
times, the fishline is twisted by the curling habit, and the
fishline is twined, and the above problem can not be overcome.
Further, a tool for correcting the twist of the fishline after
home coming is prepared, but this tool is not portable and thus
the twist can not be corrected at the fishing spot, and a tool
capable of correcting the twist at the fishing spot is desired.Thereupon, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a twist correcting device and a fishing rod capable of
immediately correcting the twist of the fishline at a fishing
spot and capable of preventing a fishline from being disposed
of due to the twist.In a fishline twist correcting device of the invention
is disposed in a winding path of a fishline for correcting a
twist of the fishline, and a helical groove directed in a
direction opposite from a winding direction of a reel is formed
along an outer peripheral surface of a correcting device main
body, and when the fishline is wound up around the reel, the 
fishline is wound up while winding the fishline around the
helical

<CLAIMS>
A fishline twist correcting device disposed in a winding
path of a fishline for correcting a twist of the fishline,

wherein a helical groove directed in a direction opposite from
a winding direction of a reel is formed along an outer peripheral

surface of a correcting device main body, and when the fishline
is wound up around the reel, the fishline is wound up while

winding the fishline around the helical groove.

1, wherein the correcting device main body is provided at its

opposite ends with thread guards, the thread guards are provided
at their end surfaces with thread through holes which are in

communication with the helical groove, and the thread guards
are formed at their outer peripheral surfaces with slits which

are in communication with the thread through holes.
The fishline twist correcting device according to claim
1 or 2, wherein the correcting device main body is detachably

mounted to the fishing rod by a mounting member.
The fishing rod having a fishline twist correcting device
described in claim 1 disposed in a winding path of a fishline.
