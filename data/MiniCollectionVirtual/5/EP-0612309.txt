<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of bis(fluoromethyl)ether by contacting formaldehyde with hydrogen fluoride in a reaction/distillation vessel. The reaction/distillation vessel is preferably a reaction/distillation column through which formaldehyde and hydrogen fluoride preferably flow in counter current. The bis(fluoromethyl)ether may be converted to difluoromethane, preferably by heating the bis(fluoromethyl)ether to elevated temperature in the presence of a metal, metal oxide, metal fluoride or metal oxyfluoride catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemical process, in 
particular a process for the production of 
bis(fluoromethyl)ether by the reaction of formaldehyde 
with hydrogen fluoride and to a process for the production 
of difluoromethane incorporating the step of producing 
bis(fluoromethyl)ether from formaldehyde and hydrogen 
fluoride. Formaldehyde and hydrogen fluoride react together to 
produce bis(fluoromethyl)ether and water: as described in The Journal of Organic Chemistry, 28, 492 (1963). The reaction is 
equilibrium limited, there being only about a 55% 
conversion of formaldehyde to bis(fluoromethyl)ether at 
20Â°C even using a 7:1 molar excess of hydrogen fluoride to 
formaldehyde to drive the equilibrium towards the 
products. We have discovered that in order to overcome 
this equilibrium problem, one or both of the products may 
be removed from the reaction mixture as soon as possible 
after it/they are formed in order to drive the equilibrium 
towards the products and achieve higher conversions of 
formaldehyde to bis(fluoromethyl)ether. Furthermore, bis(fluoromethyl)ether is useful as a 
starting material for the production of difluoromethane 
and methyl fluoride by heating bis(fluoromethyl)ether to 
elevated temperature in the presence of a suitable 
catalyst and it is desirable that water is not present in 
significant amounts in the the bis(fluoromethyl)ether 
which is heated since we have found that water promotes 
undesirable side reactions, and promotes decomposition of 
bis(fluoromethyl)ether to formaldehyde and hydrogen 
fluoride. Thus it is desirable for water to be removed 
from the water and bis(fluoromethyl)ether reaction product 
mixture before the bis(fluoromethyl)ether is further 
treated to produce difluoromethane. We have now found that the aforementioned separation 
of products from reactants and also separation of water 
from bis(fluoromethyl)ether may be achieved efficiently 
using reactive distillation.  
 According to the present invention there is provided 
a process for the production of bis(fluoromethyl)ether 
which comprises contacting formaldehyde with hydrogen 
fluoride in a reaction/distillation vessel. By a 
reaction/distillation vessel, there is meant a vessel in 
which hydrogen fluoride and formaldehyde are contacted in 
order to produce bis(fluoromethyl)ether, and from which 
the vapour in the vessel is separated from the liquid in 
the vessel and withdrawn. In terms of the products of the 
reaction (equimolar amounts of bis(fluoromethyl)ether and 
water), the
