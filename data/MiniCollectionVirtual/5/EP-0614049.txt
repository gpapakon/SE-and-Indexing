<ABSTRACT>
For simplifying the voltage supply, in particular of a redundant computer system of a control device, for example a burner controller, without impairing the safety and reliability, instead of the known fully parallel two-channel operation having two computer units and two power supply units with the associated components and feed lines, according to the invention, only one single common voltage supply is used in the form of a self-monitoring power supply unit SN which, apart from the power supply unit NT, has an overvoltage watchdog ÜW and an undervoltage watchdog UW and which communicates with the, in particular redundant computer units P1, P2 via a supply lead 1E. The overvoltage watchdog ÜW and the undervoltage watchdog UW are preferably periodically tested for functional capability by applying a test signal.

A voltage supply for a computer system of a control device in 
which computer units are connected in parallel to the control device and 

testing of the computer units is effected, in which in the event of 
malfunctioning there is a safety-procedural action on the control device, 

and in which a mains portion is used for the voltage supply, 
characterised in that the parallel computer units (P1, P2) are connected 

by way of a voltage supply line (le) to a single self-monitoring mains 
portion unit (SN) as the common voltage supply, the mains portion (NT) 

thereof co-operating with an overvoltage monitor (ÜW) and with an 
undervoltage monitor (UW) in such a way that in the event of an 

overvoltage and/or undervoltage an independent safety-procedural action 
on the control device (S) occurs. 
A voltage supply according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
control device (S) is equipped with relays (R). 
A voltage supply according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that the mains portion (NT) and the overvoltage and undervoltage 

monitors (ÜW, UW) act on a switch (Sch) which in the event of 
malfunctioning switches off the voltage supply to the control device or 

the relays (R) by way of the supply line (ld). 
A voltage supply according to claim 3 characterised in that a 
transistor switch (T101) is used as the switch (Sch). 
A voltage supply according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that after the safety-procedural action a locking flip-flop 

(VFF) prevents unintentional restoration to operation of the control 
device or the relays (R). 
A voltage supply according to one of the preceding claims  
 

characterised in that an interrogation device applies test voltage pulses 
to the overvoltage and undervoltage monitors (ÜW, UW) by way of test 

inputs (ÜT, UT) for a short time in order to simulate overvoltage and 
undervoltage respectively and to test the response of the switch (Sch) 

without the test time being sufficient to produce the safety-procedural 
action. 
A voltage supply according to claim 6 characterised in that a 
computer unit (P1) in the form of a microprocessor forms the 

interrogation device. 
A voltage supply according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the difference voltage (ΔU) between an upper 

threshold voltage (Umax) and a lower threshold voltage (Umin) is between 
10 and 30% of the regulated voltage (U1) of the computer units (P1, P2). 
A voltage supply according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a signal-back circuit (RM) detects the presence or 

absence of the supply voltage (U2) for the action on the control device 
(S) or the relay or relays (R) and signals same to at least one of the 

computer units (P1, P2). 
A voltage supply according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the mains portion unit (SN) produces the safety-procedural 

action directly on the control device or the relays (R) by way 
of the electrical supply line (d) with highest priority. 
Use of the voltage supply according to one of the preceding 
claims for a control or regulating device for burners of heating 

installations of low output of up to about 50 KW with the proviso that 
the mains portion unit (SN) supplies voltage to microcomputers serving as 

computer units (P1, P2) with self-monitoring, which are additionally  
 

integrated into a regulating circuit for the burner control or 
regulation. 
Use according to claim 11 characterised by the shut-down of the 
critical system components such as a gas valve (9) by the self-monitoring 

mains portion unit (SN) itself with the proviso that it acts directly on 
corresponding relays (R) of the control device, by-passing computer units 

(P1, P2).
