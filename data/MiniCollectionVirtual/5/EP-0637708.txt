<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a multi-port valve (10) for pneumatic control systems, the two-part housing (11) of which comprises a seal carrier (15) and a seal holder (16), which can be plugged into one another by means of their webs (21 to 24, 43 to 47), which are in each case arranged in a manner similar to combs. The seal carrier (15) has mutually parallel carrier webs (21 to 24) which extend perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the spool, carry in their round openings (32) the ring seals (38) interacting with the spool (12) and fix the said seals radially. The carrier webs and the ring seals are each designed with the same thickness. The seal holder (16) has associated holder webs (43 to 47) which are arranged in the manner of a comb, accommodate control chambers (51 to 53) and, as it is installed, engage in the slots (48) between the carrier webs (21 to 24) and support the ring seals (38) axially. The two-part housing (11) made of plastic makes possible economical construction and assembly.

Multiport valve, in particular for the control of

pneumatic motors, having a longitudinally movable control
slide (12; 74) which is arranged in a housing and, in

particular by means of piston sections, controls the
pressure medium connection between at least two

adjacently located control chambers (51-53; 91-95) which
are each connected to ports (36, 37, 54) and each of

which is separated from one another in the axial direction
by two sealing elements or are sealed off towards

the outside, which sealing elements interact with the
control slide which penetrates the control chambers and

the sealing elements installed in the housing, characterized
in that the sealing elements are designed as annular

seals (38; 81), and the housing (11; 71) has a seal
carrier (15; 72) and a seal holder (16; 73), of which the

seal carrier (15, 72) has a plurality of carrier webs
(21-24; 75-80) which start from a side extending parallel

to the longitudinal axis, extend perpendicular to the
control slide (12; 74) and surround the latter and are

arranged in a comb-like manner and in the bores (32) of
which the annular seals (38, 83) are installed in the

longitudinal direction of the control slide (12; 74), in
that the seal holder (16; 73) has holder webs (43-47;

82-88) which are likewise arranged on one side in a comb-like
manner, extend perpendicular to the control slide

(12; 74) and surround the latter, and in that the seal
carrier (15; 72) and the seal holder (16; 73) are

designed in such a way that they can be plugged together
with mutually meshing webs (21-24; 43-47) in such a way 

that each annular seal (38; 81) which is fixed in the
radial direction in a carrier web (21-24; 75-80) is held

in the axial direction by holder webs (43-47; 82-88).
Multiport valve according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the control chambers (51-53; 91-95) are

formed in the holder webs (44-46; 83-87) of the seal
holder (16; 73) and are open, in particular, towards one

side of the seal holder (16; 73).
Multiport valve according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that each control chamber (51-53; 91-95)

is sealed off towards the outside by a shaped seal
(57; 98) arranged between the seal carrier (15; 72) and

the seal holder (16; 73), the shaped seal (57; 98) being
located with radial spacing from the control slide

(12; 74) and surrounding each holder web (44-46) with the
control chamber (51-53), engaging around it in an annular

manner.
Multiport valve according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the shaped seals (57; 98) for a plurality of

control chambers (51-53; 91-95) are of integral design
and are located in one sealing plane (25; 97).
Multiport valve according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the annular seals

(38; 81), viewed in the longitudinal direction of the
control slide (12; 74), essentially have the same thickness

as the carrier webs (21-24; 75-80) which accommodate
them.
Multiport valve according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that all the annular seals (38; 81)

have the same inside and the same outside diameter.
Multiport valve according to one of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that the seal carrier (15; 72) has at

least one end face (35) from which the circular cutouts
(32) in the carrier webs (21-24) are freely accessible

and through which the annular seals (38; 81) can be
installed in the axial direction.
Multiport valve according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the seal carrier (15) has a cuboid basic

body, whose trough-shaped interior (17), which is open 
towards a mounting surface (18), is subdivided by the

carrier webs (21-24) into pocket-like cutouts (26-30)
which are open towards the mounting surface (18) and into

which the holder webs (43-47) engage, meshing with the
carrier webs (21-24) when the seal holder (15) is

installed.
Multiport valve according to one of Claims 1 to
8, characterized in that the ports (36; 37; 54) are

arranged in the seal carrier (15) and in the seal holder
(16) and are designed, in particular, for pipe connection

construction.
Multiport valve according to one of Claims 1 to
8, characterized in that the ports (A, B, P, R) in the

seal holder (73) are arranged on one side and are
designed, in particular, for plate connection

construction.
Multiport valve according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the seal carrier

(15, 72) and the seal holder (16, 73) are made of
plastic.
Multiport valve according to one of Claims 8 to
11, characterized in that the pocket-like cutouts (26-30)

between the carrier webs (21-24) have a semicircular
pocket base, and the holder webs (43-47) have correspondingly

semicircular web ends whose radius corresponds to
half the outside diameter of the annular seals (38).
Multiport valve according to Claim 10, characterized
in that it is designed as a 5/2 way valve (70), in

which five control chambers (91-95) are sealed off by six

Multiport valve according to Claim 9, characterized
in that it is designed as a 3/2 way valve (10),

whose one centrally located control chamber (52) in the
seal holder (16) is open towards opposite sides.
