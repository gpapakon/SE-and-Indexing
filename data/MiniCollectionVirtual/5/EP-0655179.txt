<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for testing a transceiver unit (1) of a time-divisional radiocommunication system. In order for a simple and reliable test method to be achieved, the method comprises assigning at least two free time slots for use, selected in such a manner that when the transmitter (2) of the unit (1) transmits on the first selected time slot, the receiver (3) of the unit (1) simultaneously receives the second selected time slot. A predetermined test signal is transmitted by the transmitter (2) using the first selected time slot. The transmitted signal is converted into the reception frequency of the unit and supplied to the receiver (3), which receives the second selected time slot. The signal obtained from the output of the receiver is compared with the test signal supplied to the transmitter. The invention also relates to a base station of a time-divisional radiocommunication system, to which the method according to the invention can be applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for testing a
transceiver unit in a time-divisional radiocommunication
system, said method comprising supplying a predetermined
test signal to the transmitter for transmission to the
receiver, and subsequently comparing the test signal
supplied to the transmitter with the test signal
receiver from the receiver, and to a base station of a
time-divisional radiocommunication system, said base
station comprising at least one transceiver unit and a
test unit for testing the operation of the transceiver
unit, said test unit comprising mixing means for
converting a test signal transmitted by the transmitter
of the transceiver unit from a transmission frequency
into a reception frequency, the output of said mixing
means being arranged to supply the test signal at the
reception frequency to the receiver, and control means
for supplying the test signal to the transmitter of the
transceiver unit and for comparing the output signal of
the receiver with the test signal supplied to the
transmitter.In this application the term transceiver unit
refers to a unit which comprises a transmitter and a
receiver and which can be mounted in a base station of a
time-divisional radiocommunication system (TDMA = Time
Division Multiple Access), such as the GSM system, where
it is connected to the antenna connections of the base
station.To ensure the operation of a transceiver unit, it
is previously known to use a separate test device
connected between the antenna connections of the
transmitter and the receiver. If the transceiver unit
is part of such a base station of a radiocommunication
system that comprises several transceiver units, the
separate test device is positioned after the transmitter 
combiner of the base station. In this case, the same
test unit is used for testing several transceiver units.
The test device converts the test signal transmitted by
the transmitter of the unit into the reception frequency
of the receiver of the unit and supplies it to the input
of the receiver after a short delay, which in the
transceiver concerned must occur between the
transmission and reception of one channel. According to
the GSM specifications, for example, this delay is three
channel time slots. The operation of the transceiver is
checked by comparing the signal obtained from the output
of the receiver with the test data supplied to the
transmitter. Such a prior art solution is known from,
for instance, WO-A-91/19364.The structure of known test devices is very
complicated owing to the delay
