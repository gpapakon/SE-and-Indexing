<ABSTRACT>
Spot footing especially designed for
the attachment of a precast concrete

or wooden pillar to a foundation and
for the extension of such a pillar,

said spot footing comprising a bottom
plate (3) and a protective casing with

a top plate (2) and a partially open
side wall part (4), the main dowel bar

(1) of the spot footing being attached
to the top plate (2). The side wall

part (4) of the protective casing is a
cylindrical structure of a circular

cross-section with one side open, and
the bottom and top plates are of a

circular shape and their diameters are
substantially equal to the diameter of

the cross-section of the cylindrical
side wall part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spot footing needed
for attaching a wooden or a precast concrete pillar to a
foundation or for extending such a pillar, as defined in
the preamble of claim 1.In current technology, precast concrete pillars are reinforced
and extended in factory by providing the lower end
of the precast pillar with a spot footing with dowels
cast in the pillar. Loads received from the spot footing
are transmitted via the footing dowels to the pillar concrete.
The pillar is additionally provided with main bars
generally placed at the corners and extending over the
entire length of the pillar. In this case, the forces
from the spot footing dowels are transmitted to the main
bar at the corner of the pillar, so there are three or
four steel bars at the corner, depending on the type of
spot footing used, to transmit the force needed for only
one bar. At its top end, the pillar has coupling bolts
placed in the corner areas to transmit the forces at the
top end of the pillar from the main bars to the coupling
bolts at the top end of the pillar. Thus, at each corner
of the top end of the pillar, there are two steel bars
running side by side through a distance corresponding to
the length of the coupling bolt. Via the threads of the
coupling bolts, the forces are again transmitted from the
coupling bolts to the spot footings of the next floor.
The forces are transmitted via corrugated dowel bars, so
there are at least two steel bars for one main bar at
each corner of the pillar. Moreover, for the installation
of the spot footing, main bars and coupling bolts, it is
necessary to mount at least nine separate parts in the
column form. Thus, this traditional structure consumes a
large amount of corrugated bar, comprises a large number
of parts to be mounted and is therefore an expensive solution. FI utility models no. 320, 341 and 544 present a solution
that allows the number of dowel bars needed in the spot
footing to be substantially reduced and that permits the
dowel bars of the spot footing to simultaneously act as
reinforcements of the pillar.In these utility models, the spot footing comprises a
bottom plate having a square shape and a hole for a
threaded main bar of the pillar of the floor below as
well as a protective casing for the nuts, in which the
inner corner has been rounded into the shape of a quarter
circle. The main dowel bar of the spot footing is placed
on top of the protective casing and it also functions as
a main bar of the pillar.In the aforementioned solutions, a drawback in

<CLAIMS>
Spot footing especially designed for the attachment of
a precast concrete or wooden pillar to a foundation and

for the extension of such a pillar, said spot footing
comprising a bottom plate (3) and a protective casing

with a top plate (2) and a partially open side wall part
(4), the bottom (3) plate being arranged to the lower

edge of the protective casing and the top plate being
arrang
ed to the upper edge of the protective casing, and
the main dowel bar (1) of the spot footing being attached

to the top plate (2),
characterised in that

the side wall part (4) of the protective casing is of a
cylindrical structure with one side open to transmit the

forces from the pillar, and that

the bottom and top plates are of a circular shape and
their diameters are substantially equal to the diameter

of the cross-section of the cylindrical side wall part. 
Spot footing as defined in claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 it comprises two protruding plates (6) disposed on
the open sides of the circular, cylindrical side wall

part (4) of the protective casing, said plates being especially
designed to guide the spot footing against the

edges of the column form during installation.
Spot footing as defined in claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the dowel bar of the spot footing is fixed to the
centre of the circular top plate.
