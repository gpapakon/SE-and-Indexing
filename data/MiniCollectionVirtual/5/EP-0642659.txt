<ABSTRACT>
High powered optoelectronic devices are continuously monitored to detect potentially dangerous default conditions in the transmission channel to which the signal generators are connected. The monitoring comprises continuously measuring the level of signals reflected from the optical transmission channel and performing corrective action when the level of said reflected signals suddenly changes. Preferably the monitoring comprises comparing the absolute level of a proportion of the reflected signals with the absolute level of a portion of the output of the signal generator. The absolute level of reflected signals will depend upon the power input into the channel and the level of reflected signals will rise if the input power rises. It is therefore desirable to take the input power into account in assessing whether or not a default condition exists.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OFΠCAL RESPONDERThis invention relates to optical responders and more specifically to responders which are adapted to detect faults in optical transmission systems utilising high optical power densities, e.g. systems using optoelectronic lasers and components such as optical amplifiers.In absolute terms the power of an optical system is usually only a few milliwatts. For example, powers of 5 milliwatts are common but few systems achieve powers above 50 milliwatts. However the waveguides produce beams which have small diameters, e.g. below 10 microns. Therefore the power density is high since 50 milliwatts concentrated into a circle of radius 5μm gives a power loading of 4 x 108 watts/m2 or 40,000 watts/cm2. Devices with powers above 50 milliwatts will, of course, give even higher power densities.An optical telecommunications system usually comprises an optical signal generator or an optical amplifier which is connected to an output fibre. After a short run, e.g. less than 10 metres, this fibre is joined to a connector to facilitate linkage to a further optical system, e.g. telecommunications transmission fibre. If this connector becomes separated an optical beam with the power densities mentioned above will emerge. This beam would be dangerous if it impinged on an engineer, especially if it impinged on an eye. This becomes a substantial risk when it is necessary to separate a connector, e.g. for maintenance or servicing.Good safety practice suggests that engineers should ensure that optical sources are disabled before they separate connectors but errors can happen and the engineers will be near (and probably looking at) the connector so that there is a substantial risk of injury.In addition the engineers often move so that the injury may be more extensive than a spot of 10 μ diameter.It is an object of this invention to detect a potentially dangerous default, e.g. a disconnection as mentioned above. In preferred embodiments automatic remedial action follows the detection of a defaultIt is to be understood that, in this specification, "remedial action" implies reducing potential for danger, e.g. by disabling the optical source or by reducing its output power and/or by initiating an alarm, e.g. an audible alarm, to warn engineers. It is emphasised that this invention is primarily concerned with recognising the default state because this recognition must precede any attempt at remedial action. This invention, which is defined in the claims, is based on the recognition that all optical channels contained
