<ABSTRACT>
A construction improvement for car-used windshield washers, in which the 
connecting rod (3) a windshield wiper arm (1) is inserted into a tube (2) 

at its front end and has a passage formed therein as well as a plurality of 
water holes (321) disposed on its rear end. The connecting rod (3) is held 

on the connecting portion of a block (33) so that water can flow through the 
passage (31) provided inside the rod (3) and sprinkle over the windshield 

from the water holes (321) along with the rocking motion of a windshield 
wiper arm (1), obtaining an effective cleaning for the dust on the 

windshield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a construction 
improvement of car-used windshield washers, 
especially to a connecting rod of a windshield wiper 
that has a plurality of water holes disposed on its 
rear hooked end and is inserted into a tube at its 
front end. In cooperation with the passage provided 
inside the connecting rod, the water flowing through 
the tube sprays over the windshield from the water 
holes along with the rocking motion of the windshield 
wiper arm in order to obtain an effective cleaning 
for the dust on windshields. A prior art car-used windshield wiper 
sprays water over the windshield from the water holes 
before it begins to scour dust and then the wiper 
moves to and fro to remove dust from the windshield. 
Water ejected from such an arrangement can only reach 
a limited area so that some corner zones are left 
uncleaned. There is also another type of windshield 
wipers that has a water chamber on the sides of which 
are disposed some water holes. Such a construction 
generally has a shortcoming of assemblage 
troublesomeness other than fabrication labroiousness, 
which in turn raises costs. The invention has been developed in 
consideration of the above problems, and its object  
 
is to provide an improved construction for car-used 
windshield wiper washers, facilitating the assemblage 
and fabrication as well as effectively dispersing 
water over windshields for completely cleaning dust. Figure 1 is a perspective exploded view of 
a subassembly of the invention. Figure 2 is a schematic view of the 
invention. Figure 2A and 2B are enlarged partial 
sectional view of the invention. Figure 3 is a plan view of the invention. Figure 4 is a perspective view showing an 
example of windshield wipers working on a car. First referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3; the 
invention mainly comprises a connecting rod 3 having 
a passage 31 provided therein with a tube 2 connected 
at its one end and enveloped in a wiper arm 1, the 
hooked end 32 of which connecting rod 3 has a 
plurality of water holes 321 disposed thereon and is  
 
inserted into a block 33 having a through hole 331 on 
its front end and a groove 332 formed on its outside 
surfaces and containing the connecting rod 3. A plug 
pin 333 passing through the holes 41 on two sides of 
a connecting member 4 and the through hole 331 of the 
block 33 further secures the hooked end 32 of the 
connecting rod 3 and the block 33 in the channel 
situated in the middle seqment of the connecting 
member 4. Flowing through the tube 2 and the passage
