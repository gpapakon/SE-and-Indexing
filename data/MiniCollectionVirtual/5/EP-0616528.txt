<CLAIMS>
An implantable capsule comprising: 

a biologically active material; 
a shell encapsulating the biologically active material, the shell 
consisting of a hydrogel of acrylonitrile and of sodium 

methallylsulphonate, said hydrogel containing at least 80 % of water. 
An implantable capsule according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it has a spherical shape with a diameter substantially comprised 

between 800 µm and 900 µm and in that the shell has a constant 
thickness substantially equal to 100 µm. 
An implantable capsule according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the biologically active material includes islets of Langerhans or 

pancreatic β cells. 
An implantable capsule according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the shell is permeable to insulin. 
An implantable capsule according to one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the biologically active material includes 

hepatocytes. 
An implantable capsule according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the shell is permeable to the nutrients required 

by the encapsulated biologically active material.
