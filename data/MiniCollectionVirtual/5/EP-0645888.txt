<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a digital delay line for supplying, from a periodic input signal (fx), n signals of the same period (P1... Pi... Pn) mutually phase-shifted by the nth of the period of the input signal, comprising n cells (C1 to Cn) each of which comprises m elementary delay elements in series, each output of a delay element being linked to an input of a multiplexer; means for comparing the phase (Pn) of the output of the nth cell to that of the input signal; and means for modifying the output of a multiplexer as a result of each comparison.

<CLAIMS>
A digital delay line supplying from a periodic
input signal (fx) n signals with the same period (P1...

Pi... Pn) mutually phase-shifted by one n-th of the input
signal period, including:


n identical delay cells (C1-Cn);
means for comparing the output phase (Pn) of the n-th
cell with the input signal phase;

   characterized in that it comprises:

m identical delay elements (d
1
... d
j
... d
m
) in series
in each cell, each output of a delay element being

connected to an input of a multiplexer (Mi); and
means for shifting of one unit the output of one and
only one multiplexer further to each comparison.
The delay line of claim 1, characterized in that
each multiplexer (Mi) is formed by m-1 two-input

multiplexers, the multiplexer with the highest rank (M
im-1
)
receiving the o
utputs of the last two cells, and the
multiplexers of lower rank receiving the output of the

multiplexer having the immediately former rank and the
output of a cell having a rank lower than the cell

processed by the multiplexer of higher rank.
The delay line of claim 1, characterized in that
each delay element (di) is formed by an NAND gate having

an input that receives the signal to be delayed and the
other input that receives an enabling signal (MASK).
The delay line of claim 3, characterized in that
the enabling signal (MASK) is used as a test signal.
The delay line of claim 3, characterized in that
the enabling signal (MASK) is used as an inhibition

signal for the not-used delay elements of a cell. 
The delay line of claim 2, characterized in that
the control signals of each two-input multiplexer are

delayed by the delay period of a delay element with
respect to the input signal phase processed by the

corresponding cell.
Application of a delay line according to any of
claims 1 to 6 for the fabrication of a voltage controlled

oscillator, each of the outputs of the delay line being
coupled to a multiplexer (10) that selects one of its

outputs as a function of signals provided by a digital
phase-locked loop.
