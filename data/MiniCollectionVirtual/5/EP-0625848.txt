<ABSTRACT>
A horizontal synchronizing apparatus includes a 
horizontal synch. signal source (11) for providing a 

horizontal synch. signal (a1), a horizontal deflection 
circuit (12,13) for generating a deflection current 

which has scanning intervals and blanking intervals 
repetitively successing in response to driving pulses and 

also retrace pulses which delay from the driving pulses as a 
function of a load on the horizontal deflection circuit (12,13), 

a phase locked loop (20) having an input (21), an 
output (e1) and a first feedback path (d1), for producing 

from the output a substantial bi-level signal synchronized to 
the horizontal synch. signal (a1) applied to the input (21), 

and a phase controlled loop (30) having an input (31), an 
output (h1) and a second feedback path, for maintaining the 

retrace pulses in synchronous with the bi-level signals. In 
the horizontal synchronizing apparatus as constructed as 

above, the phase controlled loop (30) is provided with a 
phase detection circuit (32) having a first input connected 

to the output of the phase locked loop (20) and a second 
input connected to the deflection circuit (12,13), for 

producing a first polarity current in response to the bi-level 
signal when the retrace pulses being a first state or a 

second polarity current in response to the bi-level signal 
when the retrace pulses being a second state, a filter (33) 

connected to the phase detection circuit (32) for producing a 
control signal by filtering out undesired components of the 

first and second polarity signals, and a phase controllable 
device (34) having a control input coupled to the output of 

the filter (33) for producing the driving pulse which 
maintains the retrace pulses in synchronous with the bi-level 

signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a horizontal
synchronizing apparatus for use in a television receiver or a
monitoring display, and more particularly, to a horizontal
synchronizing apparatus capable of preventing distortions of
picture images.Generally when a television receiver displays images
processed from a television broadcasting signal on a screen,
a video signal representing image to be displayed is formed
by repetitively scanning the display screen of a picture tube
by an electron beam, and the same time by modulating the
intensity of the electron beam with a video signal component
of a composite video signal generated from the television
broadcasting signal. The television receiver controls a
deflection circuit of the horizontal synchronizing apparatus
to synchronize with a sync. signal of the composite video
signal, so as to make the trace of the electron beam
synchronize with the video signal component.Here, the composite video signal tends to include
distortions due to an electronic noise or a thermal noise,
when the television broadcasting signal is received by the
television receiver.Accordingly although horizontal sync. pulses of the
horizontal sync. signal are carefully controlled to repeat at
a highly stable period at a broadcasting station, the 
horizontal sync. pulses become irregular and indistinct by
the noise when received by the television receiver.
Therefore it is conventionally performed to synchronize the
horizontal synchronizing apparatus which use an oscillator
for generating the horizontal sync. signal under the control
of synchronization by a phase locked loop. So, even if the
horizontal sync. pulses becomes indistinct due to the noise,
the oscillating frequency generated from the oscillator
remains constant by using the horizontal synchronizing
apparatus. Thus it becomes able to continuously produce
retrace pulses for regularly controlling deflections.Here, the horizontal synchronizing apparatus generates
high voltage pulses to perform a relatively quick repetitive
scanning when the television receiver operates normally. It
is common that an anode high voltage for activating a
television picture tube is produced by rectifying and
smoothing the high voltage pulses. The horizontal
synchronizing apparatus often drives a low voltage power
supply source for use in circuits other than the television
receiver, but it happens that timings of the retrace pulses
generated by the horizontal synchronizing apparatus changes
in accordance with a load change of the horizontal
sy
