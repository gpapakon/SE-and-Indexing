<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a surgical apparatus (100) for pulverising the nucleus of the lens of an eye (cataract) and for removing the pulverised nucleus by suction from the eye of a living creature. The surgical apparatus (100), which is provided with a cutting tool designated in its entirety by (75; 75'; 75''), comprises a housing (95) and a head piece (80) located thereon and designed to accommodate a pilot tube (40; 45; 70). A tubular probe (30; 50; 60) is arranged in the pilot tube (40; 45; 70). The tubular probe is operatively connected to drive means located in the housing (95) by one end and it is designed as a cutting element on the other end which projects from the pilot tube (40, 45; 70). The cutting element is provided with at least two wing members oriented transversely relative to the longitudinal axis (X) of the pilot tube (40; 45; 70).   The tubular probe (30; 50; 60) provided with the cutting element can be moved rotatingly relative to the stationary pilot tube (40; 45; 70) about the longitudinal axis (X) and/or can be moved in the longitudinal direction at a high frequency.

A device for pulverizing and removing the nucleus from
the lens of an eye of a living creature, said device

comprising a housing (95) designed substantially in the form
of a handpiece with drive means arranged therein, also a nose

section (80) provided with a guide tube (40;45;70) and
arranged at one end of the housing, as well as a tubular

probe (30;50;60) coaxially arranged in the guide tube, which
is provided with a fluid supply passag
e and is connected to
an infusion line at the end arranged in the nose section,

while at the other end it is provided with at least one
discharge opening, and the said tubular probe possesses at

the end projecting from the guide tube an aspiration opening
and a cutting element (35;55;65) that is rotatingly driven

around a common longitudinal axis (X), while at the opposite
end arranged in the nose section it is provided with an

extraction opening which is connected to a suction pump via a
chamber sealed off from the supply passage, and also via a

suction line connected to said chamber, for the purpose of
extracting the excess fluid together with the particles of

lens material, characterized in that, in addition to
executing a rotating motion, the tubular probe (30;50;60),

with the cutting element (35;55;65) arranged thereon, can be
oscillatingly driven along the longitudinal axis, relative to

the guide tube (40;45;70) fixedly mounted in the nose section
(80), and also in that the cutting element (35;55;65) is

provided with at least two wing sections (35',35'';55',55'';
65' ,65'') located substantially in a plane containing the

longitudinal axis (X).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
tubular probe (30;50;60) with the cutting element (35;55;65)

arranged thereon is rotatingly driven in combination with a
high-frequency oscillatory motion relative to the guide tube

(40;45;70). 
A device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the cutting element (35;55) possesses a supporting body

(34;54) attached to the tubular probe (30;50) and projecting
from the guide tube (40;50), said supporting body being

penetrated axially by an aspiration opening (31;51) and also
being provided with two diametrically opposed wing sections

(35',35'';55',55'').
A device according to the claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the supporting body (34) is substantially funnel-shaped

and possesses a first cylindrical section (33)
attached to the tubular probe (30) and coaxially arranged in

the guide tube (40), a conical section (33'), as well as a
second cylindrical section (32), and in that the two wing

sections (35',35'') of the cutting element (35), which are
provided with cutting edges (36,36'), are arranged on and

attached to the supporting body (34) so that they are flush
relative to the annular surface (32') of the second section

(32) and so that a gap (39,39') exists relative to the upper
edge (42) of the guide tube (40).
A device according to the claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the supporting body (54) possesses a cylindrical

section (54') attached to the tubular probe (50) and
coaxially arranged in the guide tube (45), and also a conical

section (53), and in that the two wing sections (55',55'') of
the cutting element (55), said wing sections being provided

with cutting edges (56,56'), and also sections (57,57'),
which are separated by an axial gap (58), are attached

substantially to the conical section (53) of the supporting
body (54), and the wing sections project slightly in relation

to the annular surface (53') of the conical section (53).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
cutting element (65), which is only partially divided into

two wing sections (65',65'') by a slot (68), said slot being 
axially aligned with the longitudinal axis (X) and said wing

sections being provided with cutting edges (66,66'), is
