<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for testing refrigerant of one 
type for contamination by refrigerant of another type as would 

be the case if an air conditioning or refrigeration system 
charged with a non-chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant received a 

replenishment charge of a chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant. A 
sample of the suspected refrigerant mix is exposed to a reagent 

that will decompose the contaminant refrigerant but not 
the refrigerant that is proper for the system. The sample is 

then tested for a product of the decomposition. If the product 
is present, then one can conclude that the contaminant 

refrigerant is present.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of vapor
compression air conditioning and refrigeration systems. More
specifically, the invention relates to a method, as well as an
apparatus for practicing the method, for detecting the presence,
as a contaminant, of one type of refrigerant in a system
that uses another type of refrigerant.A large proportion of the air conditioning systems in use
today use chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based refrigerants. There
is, however, wide acceptance of the proposition that chlorine
contributes to the destruction of the earth's ozone layer and
that use of CFC-based refrigerants leads to the introduction
of chlorine into the atmosphere. In an effort to slow or halt
the rate of ozone depletion and in response to governmental
mandates, manufacturers are using alternative refrigerants,
containing less or no chlorine, in newer air conditioning
systems. As a result, maintenance personnel are more and more
likely to encounter air conditioning systems using non-CFC
based refrigerants.In general, one should not mix CFC and non-CFC based
refrigerants in the charge of a single system. System materials
compatible with one refrigerant type are frequently not
compatible with another refrigerant type. For example, lubricating
oils are commonly added to the refrigerant charge in a
system to provide lubrication to system components such as the
compressor. Lubricating oils suitable for use with CFC based
refrigerants are not compatible with non-CFC based refrigerants.
Use of the improper lubricating oil or charging a
system with the incorrect refrigerant can lead to significant,
even catastrophic, damage to the system.The application with perhaps the highest potential for
system damage due to charging with an improper refrigerant is
in automotive air conditioning. The automotive industry is
phasing out systems using CFC refrigerant R-12 in favor of
systems using non-CFC refrigerant R-134a, both in newly manufactured 
systems and by conversion of existing systems. Newly
manufactured automotive air conditioning systems bear prominent
markings identifying the type of refrigerant used by the
system but older systems do not. There is a greater likelihood
that untrained and unqualified persons will attempt to
service automotive air conditioning systems than other systems
used in other applications. Charging R-12 into a system using
R-134a can lead to component failures of such magnitude that
repair may require replacement of the entire system. Charging
R-134a into a system using R-12 can produce
