<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multicomponent dental cement which comprises as a first component an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compound, as a second component calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide or a precursor thereof and, in addition, a polymerization initiator, whose constituents can be present in one or more cement components, which is characterized in that the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compound has both at least one  beta -dicarbonyl group and at least one acrylic, alkylacrylic or vinylaromatic group. Also embraced are a process for the preparation of the multicomponent dental cement and the use of the polymerizable beta -dicarbonyl compounds described in calcium hydroxide dental cements.
