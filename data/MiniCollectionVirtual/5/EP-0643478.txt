having a gate connected to an input terminal (70) and a drain connected 

through an output NMOS transistor (2) to an output terminal (71).
 

An amplification circuit is constructed by a gate-grounded third NMOS 
transistor (3) having a source connected to the drain of the input transistor, a

input current path connected to a drain of the third transistor, and a current

impedance until a minimum output signal voltage reaches around 0.5 V, and 

can also have a minimum working voltage supply voltage of about 2 V, and at 
the same time, a circuit construction suitable for IC in the CMOS process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cascode circuit, and more
particularly, to a cascode circuit configured to operate at a low working
voltage and to have a wide amplitude of an output signal.Conventional cascode circuits called a "regulated cascode" have
been known. One example of this cascode circuit is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. JP-A-59-012603.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a circuit diagram illustrating
a cascode circuit disclosed in this laid-open publication. The shown
cascode comprises a pair of NMOS (N-channel MOS) transistors 1 and 2
connected in series between an output terminal 71 and a low voltage
supply potential (ground), and an NMOS transistor 36 and a PMOS
(P-channel MOS) transistor 37 connected in series between a high voltage
supply potential VDD and the low voltage supply potential (ground). A
gate electrode of the transistor 1 is connected to an input terminal 70, and
a gate electrode of the transistor 36 is connected to a connecting node "A"
between the transistors 1 and 2. A gate electrode of the transistor 2 is
connected to a connecting node "D" between the transistors 36 and 37. A 
voltage source VG is connected between a gate electrode and a drain
electrode of the transistor 37.This cascode circuit has a powerful negative feedback loop, which is
constituted of an amplification circuit composed of the transistors 2 and
36, so that a source potential of the transistor 2 is fixed by a gate-source
voltage of the transistor 36, that is to say, by a gate potential of the
transistor 36.Thus, a drain current, which is determined in accordance with an
input voltage supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor 1, is almost
free from the effect of a direct current potential of the output terminal
71. Therefore, the output current becomes constant, and it has an
extremely high output impedance. As a result, it is possible to obtain a
large amplification factor when this circuit is used in an amplification
stage of an operational amplifier.As mentioned above, in the conventional cascode circuit, a lower
limit value of a working voltage at the output terminal is substantially
determined by a gate-source voltage of the transistor 36, the value being
about 1 V in a usual CMOS (complimentary metal oxide semiconductor)
process. In addition, the lower limit value of the working voltage VDD is
a saturated voltage of the transistor 37 added with respective gate-source
voltages of the transistor 2 and 36. Namely, it is about 2.5 volt.Therefore, there
