<ABSTRACT>
An ink ribbon cassette includes a supply side 
ribbon spool, a take-up side ribbon spool, a cassette 

case containing therein the supply side and take-up side 
ribbon spools and pivotably supporting at least the 

take-up side ribbon spool through a lever member and 
having an opening through which an outside feed tooth 

may mesh with the take-up side ribbon spool and further 
having a support portion provided in the opening for 

contacting the peripheral surface of the take-up side 
ribbon spool to prevent the take-up side ribbon spool 

from protruding outwardly, and biasing device for 
imparting a rotational force to the lever member so that 

the take-up side ribbon spool is urged against the 
support portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink ribbon cassette 
adapted to be removably mounted with respect to a 
recording apparatus such as a printer and to contain 
an ink ribbon therein. Generally, an ink ribbon cassette contains 
therein a supply side ribbon spool and a take-up 
side ribbon spool for winding an ink ribbon thereon. 
There are available ink ribbon cassettes in which 
the take-up side ribbon spool is movable. A ribbon cassette in which a take-up spool is 
movable is shown in Figures 15A and 15B of the accompanying 
drawings. In these figures, a ribbon 101 drawn out 
from a supply ribbon spool 100 is exposed outwardly 
and again introduced into the cassette, and then wound 
onto a take-up ribbon spool 102. The take-up spool 102 
is rotatably supported on one end of a support arm 
103. The other end of the support arm 103 is biased 
in the direction of arrow L with a force G by a coil 
spring 104. The take-up spool 102 biased in the direction 
of arrow L is moved toward an opening 105 formed  
 
in a wall surface of the ribbon cassette. The take-up 
spool 102 thus moved strikes against a side wall 106 
of the opening 105 and is stopped thereby. On the other hand, when feeding of the ink 
ribbon is to be effected, a feed tooth 107 on the 
recording apparatus side is moved in the direction of 
arrow M to push back the take-up spool 102 in the 
direction opposite to the direction L against the force 
of a spring 104 and separate the take-up spool 102 
from the side wall 106. In this state, the feed tooth 
107 is rotated by a drive source, not shown, to take 
up the take-up spool 102. On the other hand, when take-up is not effected, 
the take-up spool 102 is in contact with the side 
wall 106, as previously described. Figure 16 of the 
accompanying drawings shows such state, and the take-up 
spool 102 is in contact with the side wall 105 by a 
surface 108. If the take-up spool is left in the state 
of Figure 16 for a long time, a stepped portion 109 
is longitudinally formed on the surface of the 
take-up spool 102 as shown in Figure 17 of the 
accompanying drawings. This is because the ink ribbon 
on the spool 102 is dented. The presence of such a 
stepped portion 109 would cause tooth skip or the like 
when an attempt is made to rotate the take-up spool 
by the feed tooth 107, thus resulting in inaccurate  
 
take-up of the ribbon. Further, when the force applied to between 
the take-up spool 102 and the side wall 106 is 
considered, there are numerous disadvantages. These will now be described with

<CLAIMS>
An ink ribbon cassette including a supply side ribbon 
spool (60), a take-up side ribbon spool (61) having a 

movable axis, a cassette case containing therein said 
supply side and take-up side ribbon spool and having an 

opening through which an outside feed tooth (22) may mesh 
with said take-up spool and having a support portion (23, 

24) provided in said opening for contacting only a 
portion of said take-up side ribbon spool in the 

direction of thickness thereof to prevent said take-up 
side ribbonspool from protruding outwardly, and biasing 

means (47) for urging said take-up side ribbon spool 
against said support portion. 
An ink ribbon cassette according to claim 1, wherein 
said support portion is provided at a position whereat it 

is in contact with the widthwisely upper end portion of 
said ribbon spool (60). 
An ink ribbon cassette according to claim 1, wherein 
said support portion is provided at a position whereat it 

is in contact with the widthwisely central portion of 
said ribbon spool (60). 
An ink ribbon cassette according to claim 1, wherein 
said support portion has a planar supporting surface and 

said take-up side ribbon spool (61) substantially 
perpendicularly bears against said planar surface.
