Present invention provides a method of holding substrate 
and a substrate holding system where the amount of foreign 

substances on the back surface can be decreased, and a little 
amount of foreign substances may be transferred from a 

mounting table to a substrate. The substrate holding system 
comprises a ring-shaped leakage-proof surface having smooth 

surface on the specimen table corresponding to the periphery 
of the substrate, a plurality of contact holding portions 

against the substrate on the specimen table between the 
corresponding position to the periphery of the substrate and 

the corresponding position to the center of the substrate, and 
electrostatic ttraction means for fixing the substrate by 

contacting the back surface of the substrate to the ring-shaped 
leakage-proof surface and the contact holding portions. 

The substrate contacts to the cooling surface at the ring-shaped 
leakage-proof surface and the contact holding portion 

placed on a position inside the ring-shaped leakage-proof 
surface. The back surface of the substrate and the cooling 

surface do not contact to each other in the large portion of 
the remaining area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of holding a
substrate and a substrate holding system to hold a substrate
certainly in a production process for treating the substrate
such as semiconductor device while it is being cooled.Among substrate treating apparatuses of a production
process for semiconductor devices, there are a lot of
substrate treating apparatuses requiring to cool substrates,
such as a plasma treatment apparatus, a sputtering apparatus,
a dry etching apparatus, a CVD (chemical vapor deposition)
apparatus and a high energy ion implantation apparatus. Since
the treating environment in these apparatuses is generally
vacuum, it is difficult to cool a substrate by contacting it
to a cooling surface as in the atmospheric pressure because
of decrease in thermal conductivity. Although there is
abundant literature for thermal conductivity in vacuum
(rarefied gas), the amount of heat transferred by contact is
small because of small real contact area when common contact
surfaces come into contact with each other. Especially in heat
transfer between a substrate and a cooling surface, it is
difficult that the substrate is strongly pressed to the
cooling surface since there is possibility to caused the 
damage of substrate. Therefore, various ideas such as placing
soft elastomer on the surface contacting to a substrate have
been proposed. However, in recent years, it has become common
that a gas is introduced between a substrate and a cooling
surface to cool the substrate using the gas as a coolant,
since heat load in the substrate increases or requirement to
cool the substrate to lower temperature arises.There are various types of gas cooled substrate holding
systems. They can be roughly categorized into the following:
(1) a gas cooling type where the back surface of a substrate
and a cooling surface contact to each other and a gas is
introduced into the gap between the both surfaces formed by
the surface roughness, and (2) a gas cooling type where the
back surface of a substrate and a cooling surface do not
contact to each other and a gas is introduced into the gap
between the both surfaces in the same way as above.The prior art of gas cooling type belonging to the former
are described in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication
No.2-27778 (1990), Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No.62-274625 (1987), Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
