<ABSTRACT>
The valve has a sleeve-like closure element (16) movable in an axial through-flow channel (4) with a lift drive (24) arranged coaxially thereto. Said closure element, when closed, bears on its outer periphery on a centrically arranged flow unit (5) to provide a seal. The entire through-flow channel (4) is designed to favour flow in both directions.

Valve with a housing (1) which has a flow channel 
(4) in which is arranged a flow body (5) constructed to 

be favourable to flow in both directions of current 
flow, having flow parts (12, 13) aligned in opposite 

directions to each other in the axial direction of the 
flow channel (4), a sliding sleeve (17) being provided 

which is movable in the axial direction and in the 
closed state is in sealing engagement with the flow 

body (5), and which is operatively connected to a 
fluid-actuated stroke drive (24) with a cylinder 

chamber (25), characterised in that the sliding sleeve 
(17) is mounted movably in the flow channel (4) by 

means of round rubber rings (20b) on both sides of the 
cylinder chamber (25) open to the flow channel (4), the 

round rubber rings (20b) at the same time sealing the 
cylinder chamber (25) with respect to the flow channel 

(4), and the portions (1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17) which make 
contact with the flow medium are made of plastics. 
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the flow parts (12, 13) are of conical construction. 
Valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the flow body (5) is fixedly connected by means of 

cross-pieces (10) directly to the housing (1) or to an 
outer ring (11) which is firmly clamped between two 

housing portions (6, 7). 
Valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the sliding sleeve (17) can be 

pushed or pressed with its inner circumference (22) 
or with its end (36) onto a sealing surface (14, 37) 

of the flow body (5), a seal (15, 38, 45) being  
 

fitted either on the flow body (5) or on the sliding 
sleeve (17). 
Valve according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the cylinder chamber (25) is 

arranged coaxially with the flow channel (4), and 
the piston (23) is fixedly connected to the sliding 

sleeve (17). 
Valve according to claim 5, characterised in that 
on the piston (23) a rod (32) is secured which in the 

closed position of the valve protrudes out of a bore 
(33) of the housing (1) and forms a valve-position 

indicator (34) which serves as a signal transmitter for 
an electric, optical or pneumatic sensing signal of the 

valve position. 
Valve according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the valve is constructed as a 

cut-off valve and/or a flow-regulating valve. 
Valve according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the stroke drive (24) is operatively connected to a 

travel sensor which is arranged in the regulating 
circuit for controlling the stroke drive (24). 
Valve according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the flow characteristic is almost 

linear. 
Valve according to one of claims 2 to 8, 
characterised in that the flow characteristic can be 

selected by the shape of the conical casing (35) of the 
flow part (13). 
Valve according to one of claims 1 to 10,  
 

the sliding sleeve (17) by means of the stroke drive 
(24) is practically independent of the pressure of the 

flow medium. 
Valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that an inverting diaphragm (40) is 

arranged between the housing (1) and the sliding 
sleeve (17). 
Valve according to claim 12, characterised in that 
the inverting diaphragm (40) has on the inner 

circumference of the end connected to the sliding 
sleeve (17) a sealing bead (43) which in the closed 

position of the sliding sleeve (17) lies on the 
cylindrical sealing surface (14) or the conical casing 

surface (35) of the flow body (5). 
Valve according to one of claims 12 or 13, 
characterised in that the inner contour of the 

inverting diaphragm (40) in open positions forms a 
flow-favourable transition from the housing (1) to the 

sliding sleeve (17) of the flow channel (4). 
Valve according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the elastomer seal (38) in the flow body (5) or the 

elastomer seal (47) on the front end of the sliding 
sleeve (17) is injected in. 
Valve according to one of claims 4 to 15, 
characterised in that the sliding sleeve (17) is 

mounted in bearing parts (19) of the housing (1) which 
are provided with sealing arrangements (20) having the 

round rubber rings (20b), a leakage bore (52) being 
respectively arranged between two round rubber rings 

(20b).
