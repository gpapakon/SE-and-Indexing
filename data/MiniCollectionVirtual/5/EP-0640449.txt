<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutting bar with a cutting layer (5) consisting of a highly wear-resistant material, e.g. polycrystalline diamond material, which is fixedly connected on a backing (25) and forms a rail piece (4) therewith, a plurality of rail pieces, lined up in a row one beside the other, being fitted on a retaining means (1) which is of an essentially rectangular cross-section and consists of a wear-resistant material, e.g. hard metal. The retaining means (1) is provided, on two adjacent edges (2, 3) in each case with a groove (6, 7) which projects obliquely into the retaining means (1) and has essentially parallel walls (13, 14), into which the rail pieces (4) are inserted such that the walls (13, 14) of the two grooves (6, 7) reach as far as the cutting layer (5) of the rail pieces (4), the walls located between the two grooves (6, 7) being formed by a clamping piece (17) which can be screwed on the retaining means (1) and fixedly clamp all those rail pieces (4) retained in the two grooves (6, 7) together on the retaining means (1).
