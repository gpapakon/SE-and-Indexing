<ABSTRACT>
DNA constructs comprise a DNA sequence homologous to some or all of the pectinesterase gene encoded by the clone pB8 (Sequence ID No. 1), under control of a transcriptional initiation region operative in plants for transcribing this DNA sequence, optionally in the antisense direction to produce RNA complementary to the gene mRNA. From such constructs may be derived transformed plant cells and plants in which expression of pectinesterase genes is inhibited: fruit from the plants (such as tomatoes) can show modified ripening properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
DNA, DNA CONSTRUCTS, CELLS AND PLANTS DERIVED THEREFROMThis invention relates to novel DNA constructs, plant cells containing the constructs and plants derived therefrom. In particular it involves the use of antisense or sense RNA technology to control gene expression in plants.During tomato fruit ripening, the components of the cell walls undergo a series of modifications. The pectin component is subject to substantial modification and degradation. The major changes to the pectin include: solubilisation, depolymerisation and demethylation. The changes in texture of the fruit that occur during ripening occur in parallel with the changes to the pectin component. It has been demonstrated that many of these changes are the result of the action of enzymes in the cell wall.The cell wall enzymes polygalacturonase and pectin esterase have a major role in modifying pectin during fruit ripening. Individual cDNA clones that corresponded to mRNAs encoding these two enzymes have previously been identified and characterised. DNA sequences from these clones have been used to demonstrate sense and antisense inhibition of these enzymes (EPA 271,988, ICI). For antisense inhibition of, say, pectin esterase, a fragment of DNA coding for the mRNA that produces pectinesterase is inserted into the plant genome under control of a plant promoter, but in reverse orientation. In this way the plant produces RNA sequences complementary to the mRNA that is translated into pectin esterase: and this interferes in some way with the translation of the mRNA into protein.For sense inhibition of, say, polygalacturonase, a fragment of DNA coding for the mRNA that produces polygalacturonase is inserted into the plant genome under control of a plant promoter, in normal orientation. The plant produces RNA 

 - 1 - sequences homologous with part of the full-length mRNA that is translated into polygalacturonase. Again, this interferes with and can substantially inhibit the translation of polygalacturonase mRNA into protein. How this happens is not clear.In this invention, we provide clones comprising further novel DNA coding sequences from a new pectin esterase gene. These can be used to make DNA constructs that will control expression of pectinesterase, either by sense or antisense inhibition.In work leading to the invention, we have identified a novel cDNA (pB8) which encodes a tomato pectin esterase isoenzyme. The cDNA was identified in a clone from a library constructed using mRNA isolated from tomatoes at an early ripening stage. The cDNA
