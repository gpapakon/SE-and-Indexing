<ABSTRACT>
A connectorized capillary and in-line flow cell system which greatly 
expedites the construction of capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and 

other 
separation instrumentation. A capillary (20) is mounted within a 

cavity (12) formed 
in a body (11), and a mechanical fastener (16) is positioned about 

the body. The 
inner diameter of the fastener is less than the outer diameter of the 

body, so 
that the connector may be firmly coupled to any system component 

having 
a corresponding portion adapted to accept the fastener. The 

connectorized 
capillaries thus permit permanent or semi-permanent attachment to various 

in-line flow cell devices such as detectors, valves, buffer reservoirs 
and the 

like. For example, an in-line conductivity detector is assembled by 
connecting a conductivity meter to the opposing ends of the flow cell 

body. 
Annular sensing surfaces can also be provided within the cell. The same 

basic flow cell structure can also be used as a discrete separation 
valve by 

forming two transverse openings in the flow cell body and by using a 
ferrule 

having a slotted or castleated end. The valve can be electrically 
operated 

by switching a ground reference electrode between two or more buffer 
reservoirs. The same connectorized capillaries may also be used with 

fused 
plate-type systems containing etched channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to analytical instrumentation and more 
specifically to a technique for interconnecting the various components of a 
separation analysis instrument. Scientific researchers often require the identification of the 
constituent parts of chemical and biological samples. For example, 
particular experiments may require determination of the homogeneity, 
identification of proteins, or even the mapping of nucleic acid structures 
such as DNA and RNA. The instruments used to perform such analyses typically operate on 
the principle that molecular species can be isolated from one another by 
capitalizing on the fact that each species has a unique combination of mass, 
size, shape, charge, mobility, density, sub-unit structure, or optical 
emission, absorption, or reflectance. Liquid chromatography (LC), super 
critical fluid chromatography (SFC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary 
zone electrophoresis (CZE) are among the most commonly used separation 
techniques that take advantage of one or more of these differences in 
molecular properties. Capillary zone electrophoresis, for example, makes use of the fact 
that different ionic species have different mobilities when subjected to an 
electric field. In a CZE instrument, an extremely thin capillary tube is 
typically filled with a conductive buffer solution. A small amount of the  
 
sample to be analyzed is then introduced into the buffer solution at an inlet 
end of the capillary tube, and an electrical potential difference is applied 
across the ends of the tube. The resulting electric field causes the various 
ions in the sample to begin migrating down the tube. Because of 
differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of different ions, the various 
constituents of the sample exit the outlet end of the tube at different times, 
and in groups of like ions, or so-called 'zones'. The chemical or biological 
makeup of a sample can thus be detected by determining the timing and the 
concentration of the zones exiting from the tube. In CZE and similar instruments which rely on separation techniques, it 
is often advantageous or necessary to connect capillary tubes together. 
Likewise, it is often necessary to connect capillary tubes to various 
structures such as detectors, fluid valves, and buffer solution reservoirs, to 
further process and separate the samples. A problem generally exists with such apparatus, since the user cannot 
readily change a particular configuration. For example, researchers often 
may wish to compare
