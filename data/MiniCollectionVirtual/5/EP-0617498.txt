<ABSTRACT>
To reduce fire hazards which can occur when, owing to wear, at least one of 
the leads (42, 44) of a supply cable losts continuity, allowing just a problematic 

current conduction, causing repeated electric arcs (60) tending to set on fire 
electrically insulating but flammable materials, is provided a guard lead (66), 

surrounding the leads (42, 44) and connectable to a ground tap (32) compulsory for 
every electric system causing the intervention of a differential circuit breaker (14) of 

highly sensitive kind for protection from electric shocks. 
Specifically, the guard lead (66) is wound around the conductor pair forming the 
supply cable and is in the form of a flat ribbon or a wire gauze (preferably a 

copper gauze) to lower the temperature of insulating parts starting a fire and contain 
this fire in the immediate neighbourhood of the fault having caused that. Further, 

the guard lead (66) is ground connected through current limiting means (70) to limit 
the ground fault currents to a magnitude sufficient to cause tripping of the 

differential circuit breaker but not cause fire beginnings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention regards a safety protecting system to reduce fire risks 
connected to electric faults of supply cables as well as inside electric devices where 
a wide use of electrically insulating but easily flammable materials is expected. Presently there is the tendency to install in electric systems, for both civil. 
industrial and trading or administrating buildings the so-called highly sensitive 
differential circuit breakers (commonly known as "life saving" circuit breaker) to 
provide protection against electric shocks caused by accidental contacts of body parts 
of a user between one of the electric leads and ground. These highly sensitive differential circuit breakers exist already for long time, so 
that there are in trade many kinds of them fully accomplishing their task and the 
European Regulations on the safety of the electric systems made compulsory their 
use, even with different features, according to their installation either in civil 
buildings or in other buildings. However, while their protective features against ground faults and thus against 
shock hazards, are excellent owing to the very small currents sufficient to cause their 
tripping, they do not seem to have so good protective features against faults due to 
wire intermittent interruption and to short circuit between them for which must be 
necessarily provided a poorly sensitive tripping, because must be allowed a current 
flow high enough to meet the requirement of at least a household user (about 14 
Amp. for a usual household user of about 3kw). The reason for that is selfevident 
to anyone skilled in this art and resides in the structure of the above mentioned 
circuit breaker, as herebelow briefly specified. The typical safety tripping circuit breaker belonging to the kind of the so-called 
"life saving" circuit breakers consists of a common magnetothermal tripping circuit 
breaker provided on its load side with a differential transformer comprising two 
primary windings substantially formed by two short wire pieces of so high 
cross-section to bear the current to be provided to the user (for example the above 
mentioned 14 Amp.) and a secondary winding formed by many turns of thin wire at 
which can be formed sufficient voltage to drive a shunt trip unit connected to the 
engaging mechanism of main contacts of the circuit breaker itself. Owing to the specific features of the differential transformers, when in the two 
primary windings flow equal currents, as the magnetic effects of these two currents  
 
are

Safety system for protecting electric cables and apparatus from fire producing 
faults characterized by adding to the leads (42, 44, 82) of the cable (38) or the 

apparatus (40) a further guard lead (66) which at the beginning of the thermal 
alteration of an insulator of one of the leads (42, 44, 82) diverts a portion of the 

current to ground, causing the imediate operation of a differential transformer (24) 
and of a shunt trip unit (22) by it actuated which causes the opening of the 

contacts of a differential circuit breaker (14), said guard lead (66) arranged around 
the main leads (42, 44, 82) of the cable (38) or the apparatus (40) providing also to 

operate as temporary heat sink tending to lower the temperature of portions of the 
cable (38) or electric apparatus (40) prone to fire beginning, disconnecting 

istantaneously electric power which could extend the fire azard and reach the 
condition of firm short circuit between the leads (42, 44) of the cable (38) or the 

apparatus(40), lowering very much the hazard of fire through heat removal from 
combustible or however tarred portions.

and ground (32) are interposed current limiting means (70) allowing the flow of 

sufficient ground current to cause the operation of the shunt tripping unit (22) but 
not sufficient to substantially raise the temperature of the portion prone to fault, as 

the current of an electric spark from a lead of the cable (38) or electric apparatus 
(40) to ground can be contained into amounts of the same order of the tripping 

currents of the differential circuit breaker (14).
