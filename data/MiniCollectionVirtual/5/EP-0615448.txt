<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel inhibitors of sex steroid activity such as
antiestrogen compounds having effective antagonistic capability while
substantially lacking agonistic effects. More particularly, certain preferred
embodiments of the invention relate to certain three-ring compounds
which have high affinity for estrogen receptors but do not activate such
receptors and/or which inhibit the production of sex steroids or their
precursors.During the treatment of certain sex steroid-dependent diseases, it is important
to greatly reduce or, if possible, eliminate certain sex steroid-induced effects. For
this purpose, it is desirable both to block receptor sites stimulated by sex steroids 
and also to reduce the amount of sex steroid available to act at these sites. For
example, alternative or concurrent therapy to administration of antiestrogens
could involve attempts to block the production of estrogens (e.g. by
ovariectomy) such that less is available to activate receptor sites. However,
prior art methods for blocking estrogen production insufficiently inhibit
estrogen-induced functions. Indeed, it is possible that even in the total absence
of sex steroid, some receptors may be activated. See Simard and Labrie,
"Keoxifene shows pure antiestrogenic activity in pituitary gonadotrophs", Mol.
Cell. Endocrinol. 39: 141-144, (1985), especially page 144.Hence, antagonists of sex steroids may produce greater therapeutic results than
therapy which only inhibits sex steroid production. Prior art antagonists,
however, often have insufficient affinity for receptors, and some, although
capable of binding the receptors, may themselves act as agonists and
undesirably activate the very receptors they are intended to shield from
activation.There is, therefore, a need in the art for antiestrogens which effectively block
estrogen receptors with minimal or no agonistic effect. In Wakeling and
Bowler, "Steroidal Pure Antioestrogens", J. Endocrinol. 112: R7-R10 (1987), a
steroid derivative is said to act as an antiestrogen but to exhibit some estrogen
activity. The net effectiveness of a compound is effected by both its agonistic
(undesirable) and antagonistic (desirable) activities. In U.S. Patent 4,094,994, it is disclosed that the use of certain antiestrogens may
inhibit certain human breast tumor cells.H. Mouridsen et al., Cancer Treatm. Rev. 5: 131-141 (1978), discloses that
Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, is effective in remission of advanced breast cancer
in about 30 percent of the women patients treated.The combined
