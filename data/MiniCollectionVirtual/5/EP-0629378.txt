<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus which detects a moving portion and a stationary portion in one and the same frame, selects 
suitable averaging coefficients for them so as to improve the ability to follow an image, and can offer sufficient noise removing 

performance. The apparatus comprises a frame memory for storing old data as reception signals most recently inputted, a 
weight function generator for determining difference data as an absolute value of the difference between new data as a reception 

signal inputted this time and old data read out from the frame memory for each pixel, and calculating "ω" and "ω-1" of the averaging 
coefficients as the weight functions of the new data or the old data and the difference data, a new data multiplier form multiplying 

the new data by the output data "1-ω" of the weight function generator for each pixel, and old data multiplier for multiplying 
the old data read out from the frame memory by the output data "ω" of the weight function generator for each pixel, and 

an adder for adding the output data of the new data multiplier to the output data of the old data multiplier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus having an inter-frame
averaging function improved in its averaging
characteristic.An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus is such
that transmits an ultrasonic signal from its ultrasonic
probe into an examined body, receives the signal echoing
from tissues or a diseased part of the examined body,
and displays a tomographic image formed from the echo
signal on a CRT for diagnostic use.In such an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus,
in the case where the frame rate is low, i.e., where the
interval is large between the periods in which the
ultrasonic wave is transmitted, if the change between
the signal received one frame before and the signal
currently received is great, there is produced a flicker
on the CRT screen. In order to improve the situation, a 
method called an inter-frame averaging process to
average the previous and current data has been in use.In the inter-frame averaging process which
has so far been in practice, arithmetic averaging of the
previous frame data and the current frame data has been
performed using a constant arithmetic-averaging
coefficient at all times. Accordingly, there have been
such problems that, when the examined object is a moving
reflector such as a valve of the heart and a flow of
blood or when the ultrasonic wave is transmitted and
received while the ultrasonic probe is being moved, the
characteristic of the apparatus to follow up an image of
an internal organ or the like is deteriorated and an
afterimage is produced. If the weighting with the
arithmetic-averaging coefficient ω is lightened to
improve the situation, a difficulty arises that noises
increase and a flickering view is produced.On the other hand, there has been a method in
which the absolute value of the differential between the
old data and the new data is taken and the value of ω is
varied according to the absolute value and such a
variable value of ω is used in an arithmetic averaging
process. In this method, while the arithmetic-averaging
coefficient ω is varied for each frame according to a 
detected movement of the echoing part, the averaging
process for the entire object becomes lighter when there
is a moving part in the image and, hence, the averaging
process for the portion where there is no movement also
becomes lighter and such a difficulty arises that noises
cannot be sufficiently removed.The US-A-4 785 818 discloses
an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the preamble of
claim 1.The present invention was made in view of the
