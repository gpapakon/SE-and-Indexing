<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process to increase the shear loading capacity of mechanical connections between two parts (1, 2) with touching connection surfaces (3, 4), the connection surfaces (3, 4) of the parts (1, 2) being provided with reliefs (5, 6) and filled with a liquid, durable plastic (9). The intention of the invention is to reduce production expenditure.

Method of increasing the transverse loadability of mechanical connections
between two parts (1, 2) with contacting connection surfaces

(3, 4), in which the connection surfaces (3, 4) are each provided
with at least one cut-out (5, 6), wherein a cut-out (5) of one

part (1) is respectively coveringly located opposite to a cut-out (6) of
the other part (2) and the respectively oppositely disposed cut-outs

(5, 6) are together provided with at least one passage (7, 8) leading
outwardly, via which these cut-outs (5, 6) can be filled out with a

liquid or pasty and also curable plastic (9), characterized in that one
of the parts (1) to be connected consists of a harder material, and

the other part (2) of a softer material, and in that the two parts (1, 2)
are clamped against one another by the mechanical connections.
Method of increasing the transverse loadability of mechanical connections
between two parts (1, 2) having contacting connection surfaces

(3, 4), wherein the connection surface (4) of the one part (2) is
provided with a cut-out (6), with the cut-out (6) being provided with

at least one outwardly leading passage (7), by which the cut-out (6)

is filled out with a liquid or pasty and also hardenable plastic (9),
characterized in that at least one element (10) is secured to the connection

surface (3) of the other part (1) opposite to the cut-out (6)
and projects out of this surface, the part (1) provided with the element

(10) consists of a hard material, and the part (2) provided with
the cut-out (6) consists of a soft material, and the two parts (1, 2)

are clamped against one another by the mechanical connections. 
Method in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that the elements
(10) consist of a hard material, preferably metal.
Method in accordance with claim 2 or claim 3, characterized in that
the part (1) provided with the elements (10) consists of a hard material,

preferably metal.
Method in accordance with one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in
that the elements (10) have at least one thickened portion (11) at the

end projecting into the cut-out (6).
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that fibres, metal parts, or similar materials which increase the

loadability are admixed to the plastic (9).
Method in accordance with claim 6, characterized in that the admixed
materials or parts are introduced into the cut-outs (5, 6) prior

to the filling with plastic (9).
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the cut-outs (5, 6) have the shape of a cylinder arranged perpendicular

to the connection surface (3, 4).
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the cut-outs (5, 6) have the form of a cone arranged perpendicular

to the connection surface (3, 4), with the cross-sectional area
of the cone increasing towards the connection surface (3, 4). 
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the cross-sectional area of the cut-outs (5, 6) reduces towards

the connection surface (3, 4)
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 10, characterized
in that at least one of the cut-outs (5, 6) is wetted with a parting

agent prior to the filling out with plastic (9).
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 11, characterized
in that one of the parts (1) to be connected consists of plastic and

the other part (2) of metal.
Method in accordance with claim 12, characterized in that one part
(2) is formed as a roll jacket (12) consisting predominantly of plastic

and the other part (1) consists of metal and, in the form of a lateral
cover (13) of the roll jacket (12), produces the connection to the drive

of the roll jacket (12).
