<ABSTRACT>
A skylight (10) having a roof portion (12) with a plurality of ventilating tabs (61) and a plurality of non-ventilating tabs (62) disposed substantially parallel to and spaced above a roof (31) of a building. The ratio of ventilating tabs (61) to non-ventilating tabs (62) can be altered to alter the flow of air through the skylight. The disposition of the ventilating tabs (61) assists the draw of air the skylight (10) and inhibits ingress of debris and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE A VENTILATED SKYLIGHT FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a ventilated skylight particularly, although not exclusively, envisaged for installation between a roof and a ceiling in a building.In the art of ventilated skylights it is known to provide ventilation means above the roof line in the side of the skylights. The ventilation means is disposed in a substantially vertical wall of the skylights. Splash covers are then required on the outside of the ventilation means so as to inhibit the ingress of the rain and debris and the like into the skylight through the ventilation means. A disadvantage of such an arrangement is that the flow of air into the ventilation means is thereby restricted. Also, the prevailing winds tend to cause eddy currents of air inside and around the upper end (called the roof portion) of the skylight and hence inhibit the ventilating capacity of the skylight. Further, prior art ventilated skylights do not allow for variation in the amount of ventilation, for example, to accommodate changes in the strength of the prevailing winds of different seasons of the year, or to accommodate changes due to differing geographical location of the building upon which the skylights are installed. Still further, prior art non-ventilated skylights are typically mounted flush with the roof of the building, which mounting creates difficulties in conforming the skylight to the roof to maintain the roof weather-proof especially for circular dome type skylights on tiled rooves.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present invention, to provide a ventilated skylight having a ventilation means which is disposed substantially parallel to the line of the roof. 

 In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a ventilated skylight for installation between a roof and a ceiling of a building, the ventilated skylight comprising: a web for installation into the roof, the web conforming to the roof so as to maintain the roof weather¬ proof, and the web having a hole for allowing passage of air and light through the roof; a light transmissible cover for allowing light to enter into the said hole in the web, and the light transmissible cover being weather-proof; a support means disposed about the hole in the web, the support means supporting the light transmissible cover above the roof so as to form a space between the roof and the light transmissible cover; a ventilation means associated with the support means, the ventilation means being

CLAIMS
1. A ventilated skylight for installation between a roof and a ceiling of a building, the ventilated skylight comprising: a web for installation into the roof, the web conforming to the roof so as to maintain the roof weather¬ proof, and the web having a hole for allowing passage of air and light through the roof; a light transmissible cover for allowing light to enter into the said hole in the web, and the light transmissible cover being weather-proof; a support means disposed about the hole in the web, the support means supporting the light transmissible cover above the roof so as to form a space between the roof and the light transmissible cover; a ventilation means associated with the support means, the ventilation means being located beneath the light transmissible cover and being disposed substantially parallel to and space above the line of the roof, the ventilation means allowing passage of air into and out of the skylight; and, a conduit disposed between the hole in the web and a hole in the ceiling for allowing passage of light and air through the skylight; whereby, in use, air can pass out of the skylight via the ventilation means and through the space between the light transmissible cover and the roof substantially uninhibited by prevailing winds.
2. A ventilated skylight according to claim 1, in which the ventilation means can be adjusted for adjusting the cross-sectional area for flow of air through the skylight.
3. A ventilated skylight according to claim 1, in which the ventilation means includes at least one 


ventilating tab having a grid of relatively small apertures, the tab being removable securable into a corresponding number of apertures in the support means, each of the ventilating tabs allowing passage of air through the skylight, and any number of non-ventilating tabs being solid for inhibiting passage of air through the skylight; whereby, in use, the ratio of ventilating tabs to non-ventilating tabs can be varied to vary the flow of air through the skylight.
4. A ventilated skylight according to claim 3, in which the tabs have perimeteral grooves for securement into the apertures in the support means.
5. A ventilated skylight according to claim 1, also comprising a diffuser located in a lower end of the conduit, the diffuser disposing light incident upon it from the conduit and allowing passage of air through the ceiling into the conduit.
