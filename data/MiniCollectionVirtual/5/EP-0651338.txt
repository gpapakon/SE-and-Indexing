<ABSTRACT>
A digital computer (20) is provided for generating a solution of a term 
of a numerical sequence. The digital computer (20) includes a memory (22). 

The memory (22) has stored within it solving instructions of a sequence-solving 
program and recognizing instructions for recognizing the type of 

numerical sequence. The digital computer (20) also includes a processor (24) 
for executing the solving instructions and recognizing instructions. An input 

device (26) receives data from a user. The data represents a mathematical 
expression of the numerical sequence. The data also represents a value of a 

term identifier representing the term of the numerical sequence to be solved. 
A display (28) is also provided for displaying the solution of the term.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of digital computers, and
more particularly, to a method and apparatus for solving for the terms
of numerical sequences.In today's technological society, high level mathematics is being taught
to students at an earlier age than ever before. One such high level concept is
that of numerical sequences. A numerical sequence is a sequence of
numerical entities arranged in correspondence with naturally ordered whole
numbers, i.e., 1,2,3,... The numerical entities are called "terms". Each term
is generically identified by a term identifier such as "n". The term identifier
is a variable which can be assigned a natural number to identify a particular
term. For example, the terms of a particular numerical sequence are
represented by "Un" where n is the term identifier.Where n = 3, U3 represents the third term of the numerical sequence
Un. When n can equal only a finite number of values, the numerical
sequence is finite. When n can equal an infinite number of values, the
numerical sequence is infinite.A typical task is to generate a solution for a particular term of a
numerical sequence. The terms of a numerical sequence are traditionally
solved using a user-programmed device such as a computer or calculator.EP-A-0 444 847 discloses a method of operating a data
processing system to determine the values of recurrence
variables in a set of equations which define a linear
recurrence of any order. With this method, computing time is
saved by dividing the set of equations into groups of
consecutive equations, determining temporary or parallel
values, for each group, of the recurrence variables with
those recurrence variables which are derived from equations
in the next preceding group being set to zero.
One problem is that these devices are relatively expensive. A consequence of
this expense is that few high school students have access to these devices.A second problem with these user-programmed devices is that a
program must be written to solve for the terms of the numerical sequence.  
Unfortunately, many students lack the necessary programming skills to
write such a program. Most of a student's initial time and effort, therefore, is
spent learning how to program the calculator. This expenditure of time and
effort detracts from the student's learning of the concept of numerical
sequences.A third problem with many user-programmed devices is that they do
not provide an adequate visual display. A term or group of terms can be
represented in a variety of forms. Of these
