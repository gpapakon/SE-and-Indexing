<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has relation to a package for storing 
and dispensing materials which can be harmful, particularly if 
improperly ingested. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present 
invention has relation to an attachment for a container used for 
storing and dispensing medicament tablets and the like. The present invention has further relation to such an 
attachment for a container which is resistant to opening by the 
majority of children coming in contact with it, yet which can be 
opened without undue difficulty by adults whose manual dexterity may, 
at least to a degree, be impaired. The present invention has further relation to such an 
attachment for a container which can be inexpensively manufactured to 
facilitate disposal thereof once the contents have been completely 
dispensed from the package. Child resistant packaging is understood to be a great 
concept for preventing inadvertent access by children to potentially 
dangerous materials such as medications. However, inclusion of the 
child resistant feature adds cost and, all too often, difficulty and 
frustration for the adult user when attempting to open the package. Because of deteriorating health, elderly persons tend to 
rely on medication more than the average person. The elderly may 
also tend to have impaired manual strength and dexterity. Due to the 
difficulty in opening child resistant medicine packages which are 
currently in widespread use, many elderly persons request a non-child 
resistant package substitute. Alternatively, when medications are 
purchased in child resistant packages by older adults, the child 
resistant package is oftentimes not reclosed in order to defeat the  
 
child resistant feature. As a result, a large percentage of child 
poisonings occur in the homes of such elderly adults, e.g., 
grandparents. The aforementioned problems are generally recognized in the 
packaging industry, particularly the pharmaceutical industry. 
Attempts to deal with these problems are also disclosed in the patent 
literature. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,993,208 issued to 
Ostrowsky on November 23, 1976 discloses a safety closure means 
wherein the shoulder on a container is formed with a pair of 
diametrically positioned locking lugs. The mating closure is formed 
of thermoplastic material and has a top end wall and a depending 
annular inner wall in addition to a depending outer annular skirt 
spaced from the inner wall. The inner wall includes threaded means 
for engaging the neck of the container to secure

<CLAIMS>
A child resistant attachment (100) for a container suitable for storing and 
dispensing potentially dangerous material, said attachment being resistant to opening by 

children yet readily openable by adults, said child resistant 
attachment comprising: 


(a) a finish portion (1) having a closure securement ring including first means for 
rotatably and releasably securing a closure (2) to said closure securement ring on at least 

one of its surfaces, a downwardly extending attachment ring (4) for attaching said finish 
portion to said container, and an annular collar (5), generally concentrically aligned with 

said closure securement ring, interrupted by at least one pair of slots (6), thereby forming 
at least one resiliently deformable cantilevered pushtab (7) having an exposed surface 

contour which generally conforms to the exterior surface contour of the adjacent portions 
of said annular collar to minimize the chance of inadvertent depression thereof when said 

annular collar is grasped, said pushtab having a vertical extension (8) projecting above the 
uppermost surface of said ann
ular collar, the uppermost end of said pushtab being 
inwardly movable relative to the rest of said annular collar when squeezing force is applied 

to said uppermost end of said pushtab; and 
(b) a closure (2) having a first skirt (17) including on at least one of its surfaces second 
means complementary to said first means for rotatably and releasably securing said 

closure to said closure securement ring on said finish portion and a second skirt (16) 
external to first skirt, said closure also having at least one interlocking pawl on the 

innermost surface of said second skirt, said interlocking pawl (15) being so shaped and 
positioned that it will deflect said vertical extension of said resiliently deformable pushtab 

when said closure is rotatably secured onto said finish portion, but will prevent removing 
said closure from said finish portion by rotating said closure in the reverse direction unless 

said resiliently deformable cantilevered pushtab on said annular ring is first depressed to 
disengage said pushtab vertical extension from said interlocking pawl. 
A child resistant attachment for a container according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said finish portion (1) has an upwardly extending thread ring (10) including external 

threads (9) on the outermost surface of said thread ring, said annular collar (5) being 
generally concentric about said thread ring, said closure (2) has a first skirt (17) including 

on the innermost surface of said first skirt means for rotatably and releasably securing said 
closure to said finish portion.  

 
A child resistant attachment for a container according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said finish portion (1) includes securement means on the innermost surface of said 

thread ring (10) for attaching said finish portion to said container. 
A child resistant attachment (200) for a container according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said finish portion (201) has a downwardly extending thread ring 

(204) including internal threads (209) on the innermost surface of said thread ring, said 
annular collar (205) being generally concentric to said thread ring, said first skirt of said 

closure (202) includes on the outermost surface of said first skirt means (218) for rotatably 
and releasably securing said closure to said finish portion. 
A child resistant attachment (200) for a container according to claim 4, 
characterized in that said finish portion (201) includes securement means on the outermost 

surface of said thread ring (204) for attaching said finish portion to said container. 
The child resistant attachment of any of Claims 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, characterized in that 
said attachment ring (4) includes a securement means (3) which mates with a 

corresponding securement means on said container so as to resist separation of said child 
resistant attachment from said container, especially by children, once said child resistant 

attachment is fully assembled onto said container. 
The child resistant attachment of Claim 6, characterized in that said securement 
means (3) permits unlimited 360Â° rotation of said child resistant attachment relative to said 

container about a vertical axis passing through the center of said child resistant 
attachment while maintaining said finish portion (1) securely attached to said container, 

thereby further frustrating attempts by children to gain access to the contents of said 
container. 
The child resistant attachment of any of Claims 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, characterized in that 
said attachment ring (4) on said finish portion (1) of said child resistant attachment is 

permanently secured to said container.
