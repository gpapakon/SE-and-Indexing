<ABSTRACT>
A carrying gripper presenting a gripper body (3) in 
turn presenting, on one side, a deflecting seat (5) for a 

weft yarn (11), and, on the opposite side, a gripping element (6) 
for maintaining crosswise to the gripper body the yarn 

portion extending between the deflecting seat and the 
gripping element. To ensure the yarn portion between the 

deflecting seat and the gripping element is maintained 
correctly positioned at all times, the deflecting seat (15) 

is defined, in the traveling direction of the carrying 
gripper, by an edge (17b) having a tangent perpendicular to 

the direction of the yarn upstream from the gripper. The 
seat is formed by a recess (8) in turn formed in a tab (7) of 

the gripper metal, which tab is so bent that the recess 
correctly guides the weft during exchange, and keeps the 

yarn taut even when the increase in length of the yarn 
is such as to cause it to slip out of the seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrying 
gripper for looms. As is known, on modern looms, the weft yarn is 
inserted inside the shed, formed by the heddles, using a 
carrying and a drawing gripper, which travel back and 
forth inside the shed in a crosswise direction to the 
warp yarns; the carrying gripper picking up the weft 
yarn from the reel and carrying it roughly halfway along 
the shed to the so-called "exchange point", and a hook 
portion of the drawing gripper picking up the yarn from 
the carrying gripper at the exchange point and drawing 
it to the end of the shed where it is released from the 
drawing gripper. The carrying gripper is elongated in shape and 
presents, on one longitudinal side, a seat for 
deflecting the yarn wound off the reel, and, on the 
other longitudinal side, a gripping element for 
retaining the yarn as the carrying gripper travels from 
one end of the loom to the exchange point. Before being 
gripped, the yarn therefore extends crosswise to the  
 
carrying gripper, and, as the gripper travels along the 
shed, the yarn extends substantially lengthwise of the 
gripper between this and the reel, and is deflected by 
said seat to the gripping element in a crosswise 
direction to the gripper to enable it to be picked up by 
the drawing gripper at the exchange point. To ensure troublefree engagement of the yarn by 
the hook portion of the drawing gripper at the exchange 
Point, the yarn portion between the deflecting seat and 
the gripping element must be maintained sufficiently 
straight and taut at all times. When the tension of the 
yarn slackens, however, due to inversion of the carrying 
gripper or other reasons, the yarn slips out of the seat 
and normally assumes a compressed, e.g. coiled, 
configuration. As a result, at the exchange point, where 
the carrying gripper is decelerated and arrested 
sharply, the yarn portion between the reel and the 
gripper continues traveling by force of inertia, thus 
impairing the straightness and hence correct engagement 
by the drawing gripper of the crosswise portion of the 
yarn. Yarn exchange is especially critical on modern 
looms in view of the high output rates and operating 
speeds involved. By way of a solution to the problem, a brake is 
currently provided downstream from the reel, for 
tensioning and keeping the yarn taut in the correct 
exchange position. Such constant tensioning of the yarn,  
 
however, results in added stress and increases the 
likelihood of the yarn breaking. It is an object of the present

<CLAIMS>
A carrying gripper for looms, comprising a 
gripper body in turn presenting, on one side, a seat for 

a weft yarn, and, on the opposite side, a gripping 
element for maintaining crosswise to said gripper body 

the weft yarn portion extending between said seat and 
said gripping element; characterized in that said seat 

is defined, in the traveling direction of said carrying 
gripper, by an edge having a tangent crosswise to the 

direction of the yarn upstream from the carrying 

gripper. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that said edge presents a tangent 

substantially perpendicular to said direction of the 
yarn upstream from the carrying gripper. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said seat is formed by a recess 

formed in said gripper body and presenting a wide inlet 
portion blending with a curved portion narrowing as of 

said inlet portion and towards said seat. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that said curved portion presents its 

convexity facing the bottom surface of the carrying 
gripper. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in one of the 
foregoing Claims, characterized in that said gripper 

body is made of bent sheet metal; and said recess is 
 

formed in a tab of the sheet metal of said gripper body; 
said tab being bent roughly at a right angle in relation 

to the bottom side of said gripper body. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in Claimed 5 and 
cooperating with a drawing gripper presenting a hooked 

end portion; characterized in that said tab comprises a 
curved portion presenting a curvature substantially 

opposite that of the hooked end portion of said drawing 
gripper. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that said tab comprises a guide portion 

defined at the bottom by said recess by means of a 
curved guide edge with its convexity facing said bottom 

side; said guide portion projecting towards said bottom 
side and outwards of the carrying gripper. 
A carrying gripper as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterized in that said guide portion is formed in 

said curved portion and blends at the top with a portion 
bent upwards in relation to said curved portion.
