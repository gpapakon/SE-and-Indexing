<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a prosthesis for uni-condylar or bi-condylar replacement of a joint in a human body and in particular to the tibia side of a knee joint. By means of an elongate fixture, a prosthetic plate is secured in position in a pre-prepared tibia portion and is allowed to heal, without further surgery being required. The invention also relates to a device for preparing the knee joint for prosthetic reception.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a joint prosthesis for
permanent anchorage in the bone tissue of one of the
articulatory parts of a joint in the human body, in
particular the tibia side of a knee joint, wherein the
prosthesis comprises a flat, plate-like element having
an elongate fixture portion.The reasons for surgical replacement of articulatory
parts of knee joints or other joints and the various
methods adopted are to some extent summarised in the
introductory portion of published European Patent
Application EP-A-0 183 669 (priority claimed from SE
8405989). This document also discloses an example of an
improved method for replacing a joint and a joint
prosthesis for fitting to human body joints, in
particular to knee joints. The method adopted in that
application is to perform two successive operations (a
so-called two-seance procedure) on the subject. In the
first operation an anchoring element is fixed into one
or both sides of a knee joint i.e. the tibia (shin
side) and femur (thigh side) and then allowed to
integrate into the bone tissue (so-called
osseointegration). Once firmly anchored (after about 6
weeks) a second operation is performed, whereby
articulation members are firmly attached to the
anchoring members.Whilst this method is clearly successful, it suffers 
from the drawback that the patient must be subjected to
two individual successive operations, in order that
full unloaded osseointegration can occur. Moreover, the
bone cutting operations required are fairly complex.A knee joint prosthesis having the pre-characterising features of claim 1 is found in
FR-A-2630640. The elongate fixtures of this prosthesis when implanted are oriented
parallel to the main articulation plane of the knee joint. This is also the case for the
elongate fixtures of the knee joint prosthesis made known in US-A-4919671.The present invention provides a solution to these
drawbacks by providing a joint prosthesis, the
essential features of which are defined in claim 1.Preferred features of the invention are defined in the
dependent claims.Whilst the following explanation relates particularly
to the tibial side of a knee joint it should be
understood that the prosthesis of the invention can of course be adapted to other
joints.With the joint prosthesis according to the invention
only one major surgical operation is required, during
which the knee joint is prepared in a simple yet
accurate manner and then fitted with a knee joint
prosthesis which is firmly secured. Osseointegration
and full healing can then take place
