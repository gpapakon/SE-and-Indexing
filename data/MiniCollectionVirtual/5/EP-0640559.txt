<ABSTRACT>
Process of catalytic partial oxidation of natural 
gas in order to obtain synthesis gas and formaldehyde, 

integrated with processes of hydrogenation of the 
resulting CO, such as Fischer-Tropsch and methanol 

syntheses. Such an oxidation is carried out by means 
of a catalyst constituted by one or more compounds of 

metals form Platinum Group, which is given the shape 
of wire meshes, or is deposited on a carrier made from 

inorganic compounds, in such a way that the level of 
metal or metals from Platinum Group, as percent by 

weight, is comprised within the range of from 0.1 to 
20% of the total weight of catalyst and carrier, by 

operating at temperatures comprised within the range 
of from 300 to 950°C, under pressures comprised within 

the range of from 0.5 to 50 Atm, at space velocities 
comprised within the range of from 20,000 to 1,500,000 

h⁻¹.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalytic
partial oxidation process (which in the present patent
application will be referred to, briefly, as "CPO") of
natural gas in order to obtain synthesis gas and
formaldehyde; more particularly, it relates to the
production of synthesis gas for Fischer-Tropsch (F-T)
processes, to processes for methanol and methanoldimethylether
mixtures synthesis under conditions of
high conversion rate per pass.The synthesis gas is presently manufactured by
means of processes of steam reforming, autothermal
reforming, non-catalytic partial oxidation of
hydrocarbons. The steam reforming processes
catalytically convert mixtures of hydrocarbons and
steam (H2O/C = 2.5-3.5 by vol/vol) into mixtures of CO
and H2 with a H2/CO ratio typically of round 3 when
the process is carried out by starting from natural
gas. The main reactions which describe the process are
CnHm + nH2O ----> nCO + (m+n/2)H2H2O + CO ----> CO2 + H2The H2O:C ratio in the reactant mixture is
determined by the temperature and pressure conditions
under which the reactions are carried out, as well as
by the need for inhibiting the coal formation
reactions [3] and [4]:
CnHm ----> Cn + m/2 H22CO ----> C + CO2The commonly used catalysts in this process are 
based on Ni supported on Al, Mg, Si oxide carriers.
The used carriers display high thermal stability and
mechanical strength characteristics. The reactions
take place inside tubular reactors contained inside a
combustion chamber. The pressures inside the tubes are
typically comprised within the range of from 1 to 5
MPa, and the temperature at tube outlets is typically
higher than 850°C (see, e.g., Catalysis Science and
Technology" Vol. 5, Chapter 1, J.R. Rostrup-Nielsen).
The stay times of the gas streams inside the interior
of the catalytic beds are of round five seconds. Along
the reforming tubes (which are approximately 15-m
long), which are totally filled with catalyst, large
gradients arise in the gas mixture composition.The processes of non-catalytic partial oxidation
are less widely used and are employed in order to
convert mixtures of hydrocarbons, oxygen, steam and
air into synthesis gas with H2/CO ratios of typically
round 2 if one starts from natural gas. The process
chemistry can be represented by means of equations [5]
and [2]
CnHm + n/2 O2 ----> nCO + m/2 H2The facilities installed to date by Texaco and
Shell (see Hydrocarbon Processing; April 1990, p. 99)
are provided with adiabatic reactors in which the
reactions are started inside the reactors by means
