<ABSTRACT>
Cleaning products (e.g. soap tablets, powdered detergents) are 
packaged in a material which incorporates a fungicidally effective 

amount of a pyrithione derivative, preferably zinc pyrithione.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the packaging of cleaning products as well as to 
materials useful as packaging. Examples of cleaning products with which the invention is concerned includes 
personal care products such as tablets of soap as well as domestic cleaning products 
such as detergent formulations for laundering or dishwashing purposes. Various types of packaging are used for cleaning products. For example, soap 
tablets are wrapped in paper and as a further example detergent powders are packaged in 
cardboard boxes. As an additional example, liquid cleaning products (e.g. shampoos, 
dishwashing liquids) are sold in plastics containers. (The term packaging as used herein 
is also intended to cover such containers). It has long been recognised that the components present in cleaning products 
encourage mould growth in or on the packaging material. Thus for example soap tablets 
generally have a relatively high moisture content and also contain fatty acids. This 
combination of moisture and fatty acids (which are mould nutrients) can lead to mould 
growth on the paper in which the soap is wrapped. In order to avoid the problem of mould growth it has previously been proposed 
to incorporate a fungicide in the packaging material. One fungicide which has been 
used extensively for this purpose is Carbendazim. Carbendazim does however have a number of disadvantages. In particular, it is 
classified as a pesticide which places restriction on its use and moreover does not 
provide a sufficiently wide spectrum of activity to give total protection against mould 
growth. Another fungicide which has been used in packaging for cleaning products is 
TCMTB but this sensitises skin. JP900180462 discloses the use of pyrithione compounds in the treatment of 
paper for use in the construction of building boards. DE4122654 describes a 
composition containing a pyrithione compound used for the treatment of wood. It is therefore an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the 
abovementioned disadvantages.  
 According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided the 
combination of a cleaning product enclosed within packaging which incorporates a 
fungicidally effective amount of a pyrithione derivative, wherein the pyrithione 
derivative has a particle size of less than 10 microns. The cleaning product may for example be a solid product such as a tablet of soap 
(wrapped within packaging incorporating the pyrithione derivative) or a detergent 
powder in a box formed of a material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A solid cleaning product enclosed within packaging which incorporates a 
fungicidally effective amount of a pyrithione derivative, wherein the pyrithione 

derivative has a particle size of less than 10 microns. 
The combination as claimed in claim 1 wherein the pyrithione derivative is an 
insoluble derivative. 
The combination as claimed in claim 1 wherein the pyrithione derivative is zinc 
pyrithione. 
The combination as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the pyrithione 
derivative has a particle size of less than 5 microns. 
The combination as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the packaging 
material comprises 250-2000 ppm of the pyrithione derivative. 
The combination as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the packaging 
material is a non-woven cellulosic product. 
The combination as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the cleaning 
product is a tablet of soap. 
The combination as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the cleaning 
product is a powdered detergent.
