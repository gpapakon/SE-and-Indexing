<ABSTRACT>
The combustion apparatus having a heat-recirculating function 
comprises: a porous burner component (4) being made of permeable 

metallic material and having a first region (4a) through which a fuel-air 
mixture flows and is ejected therefrom into the combustion chamber at a 

velocity higher than the burning velocity of the fuel-air mixture to form a flame 
base on the periphery of the fuel-air mixture ejection area and 

having a second region (4b) being located adjacent to and outside of the 
first region to recover heat from high temperature product gas generated 

from the combustion of the fuel-air mixture by red-heating the surface of 
the second region on the combustion chamber side while the product gas 

is penetrating through the burner component (4), wherein the heat 
recovered in the second region is conducted to the first region; the 

combustion chamber (5) being located to cover both the first region (4a) 
and the second region (4b) and enclosing these regions, and a 

cylindrical wall (6) separating a fuel-air mixture supply passage (9) from 
a product gas exhaust passage (10) by placing the fuel-air mixture supply passage 

at the inside thereof. Such a combustion apparatus having a heat-recirculating 
function comprises: a porous burner component (4) having 

more than one first region (4a) and more than one second region (4b); a 
combustion chamber (5); and more than one cylindrical wall (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combustion apparatus having a 
heat-recirculating function which preheats a fuel-air mixture 
using heat-recirculation from high temperature product gas, and 
a method of operating said apparatus. Many types of plane exothermic surface combustion 
burners have been developed and commercialized as a 
heat source for industrial use as well as household 
use because they easily generate radiant heat with 
low pollutant emission by adopting a porous burner component in a 
shape of flat plate, curved plate, or block provided with many gas 
passage pores and by combusting the fuel-air mixture, passed through 
the porous burner component, at the downstream surface of the 
component to form a uniform plane red-heat condition stably existing 
thereon. Since the combustion apparatus using a surface combustion burner 
must form a combustion zone in the porous burner component near 
the surface thereof to make the plane red heat combustion zone a high 
radiation condition, the combustion apparatus with a surface combustion 
burner has the limitation that the fuel-air mixture cannot be ejected from 
the porous burner component at a higher velocity than the burning velocity 
of the mixture thereof. The equivalence ratio of a flammable fuel-air mixture (the value of 
fuel-air ratio divided by theoretical fuel-air ratio) is in a range of 0.9 to 
1.1 in order to gain higher emissive power. The adiabatic flame 
temperature within that range considerably exceeds the durable limit of,  
 
for example, metallic sintered fiber mat used as the porous burner 
component. As s result, most of the supplied heat has to be emitted as 
the high temperature product gas, and the radiation efficiency is only 
25% (at equivalence ratio of 1) at the most. Conventional combustion apparatuses of heat-recirculating type 
have been introduced to reduce the heat supply by preheating the fuel-air 
mixture with the recovered waste heat of combusted product gas and to 
substantially improve the radiation efficiency. These conventional 
combustion apparatuses are either of the type which provides heat exchange 
via a separation wall located between the fuel-air mixture supply passage 
and the product gas exhaust passage, or of the type which is provided with a 
specially designed heat exchanger or heat accumulator. Regarding the 
former type which provides heat heat exchange via a separation wall located 
between the fuel-air mixture supply passage and product gas exhaust 
passage, insufficient heat transfer area of
