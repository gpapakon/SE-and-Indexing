<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dual textured treatment
pads comprising at least one paper pad layer laminated to at
least one nonwoven, synthetic fiber pad layer. The nonwoven
pad layer can comprise a textured repeating pattern having at
least two adjacent delineated regions simultaneously not having
the same mean thickness, wherein the first region has a mean
thickness from about 0.025 cm to about 0.30 cm and the second
region has a mean thickness from about 0.010 cm to about 0.050
cm. In other embodiments, the nonwoven pad layer can comprise
an apertured, textured, repeating pattern.The invention also encompasses cleansing or treatment pads
which comprise the dual textured pads of the instant invention
impregnated with a suitable medicated, cleansing, or cosmetic
composition.The invention also encompasses a method for treating acne
in humans comprising topically applying to the affected area a
medicated pad of the present invention.It is highly desirable to deliver cleansing products or
products for treating disorders of the skin (e.g., acne) from a
single use disposable pad. Disposable pads are both convenient
and sanitary to use. However, current disposable pads have
limitations.Most disposable pads comprise a single layer having a
single textured surface and cannot provide both gentle and
vigorous cleansing from the same pad. Moreover, many single
layered pads lack the rigidity and integrity required for
effective cleansing and/or treatment. The rigidity and
integrity of these pads can be improved by increasing their
thickness or by laminating them to a second nonwoven pad layer
to form a dual layered nonwoven pad. However, these dual 
layered pads are not very cost effective for onetime use. Also
known are dual layered pads which comprise a paper pad layer
laminated to a high-loft nonwoven pad layer. However, these
dual layered pads are still relatively expensive for one time
use. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop
treatment pads having two differently textured surfaces, which
have sufficient rigidity and integrity, and which are also cost
effective.EP-A-0 327 327 discloses cleansing pads having two or more layers of
nonwoven fabric materials and a water soluble polymeric resin.EP-A-0 308 320 discloses a strong absorbent nonwoven fabric containing
wood pulp and textile fibres prepared by hydroentanglement with a
continuous filament base web. It has been found herein that by laminating a relatively
low cost paper pad layer to a nonwoven synthetic fiber pad
layer having a low basis
