<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the separation of a high 
temperature (e.g. 300-1200째C) and high pressure (e.g. 2-20 

bar) solids-gas stream from a pressurized fluidized bed 
reactor into solids and gas while reducing the pressure of 

both the gas and solids takes place in a vertical de-entrainment 
vessel (41) having a packed bed (48) of solids 

within it. The possibility of fluidization of the solids is 
minimized by causing the velocity of the gas component of the 

solids-gas stream to be reduced during, or just prior to, 
introduction of the gas into the packed bed (48) of solids, 

e.g. by providing an expanding conical end (451, 452, 453) in 
the inlet (42) for the solids-gas stream into the vessel 

(41). A gas permeable solids impermeable element (46) may 
also or alternatively be connected to the inlet (42) and 

extend toward (optionally all the way to) the side wall of 
the vessel (41), to substantially prevent fluidization. The 

fluidization-preventing element (46) may be a perforated 
plate, ceramic filter, or wire mesh screen, and may have 

gradually increasing gas permeability from the inlet (42) to 
the vessel side wall. A number of different inlet flows to 

the vessel may be provided, and at least one separated gas 
and solids outlets (441, 442; 43) leads from the vessel (41) 

to a low (e.g. atmospheric) pressure area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus
for handling high pressure material, particularly to a
method for reducing pressure of a high-pressure solids-gas
mixture and for separating the solids from the solids-gas
mixture in a vessel. The vessel is in communication with
a reactor that is operated under a pressure of at least
about 2 bars, and serves to maintain desired reactions,
such as the combustion or gasification of fuel. The vessel
serves to remove ash or other particulate material from
the reactor.The term "solids" as used in the specification and
claims, refers to all residues known to a person skilled
in the art that may be obtained from reactions taking
place in pressurized reactors, such as circulating
fluidized bed reactors.A known method for reducing the pressure of gas-solids
mixtures is disclosed in Knowlton, T.M. Findlay, J.G. and
Chan, I. "Continuous Depressurization of Solids Using a
Restricted Pipe Discharge System", Presented at the 1989
AIChe Annual Meeting, San Francisco, California, November
5-10, 1989. In this reference, a method for
de-pressurizing a gas-solids mixture by using a Restricted
Pipe Discharge System ("RPDS") is disclosed. In the RPDS,
solids are discharged in moving packed-bed flow from
higher pressure to lower pressure through a pipe
restricted at its outlet, while the gas is forced to flow
through the packed-bed of solids, thus causing
de-pressurizing. In U.S. patents 2,684,868, 2,684,870,
2,684,872 and 2,684,873 methods for conveying or
transporting of granular solids, which can be used in the
RPDS, are disclosed in more detail.Typically, the main set of components of the RPDS 
are depressurizing piping ("transporting pipe"), a
de-entrainment vessel wherein a packed bed of solid
material is maintained for acting as a solids flow
restriction at the end of the transporting pipe, and means
for controlling the flow of the solids from the
de-entrainment vessel.An RPDS may be successfully utilized, for example, in
connection with Pressurized Fluidized Bed reactors such as
Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustors or Gasifiers and
processes executed therein. For example, in a system where
a Pressurized Fluidized Bed Gasifier, which provides a
partial gasification of fuel, is connected to a Fluidized
Bed Combustor for oxidizing the residue char from the
gasification, and in a transportation system for conveying
the solids resulting from a partial gasification, such as
char, to the final combustion, the RPDS may be
successfully employed. Any corresponding processes
