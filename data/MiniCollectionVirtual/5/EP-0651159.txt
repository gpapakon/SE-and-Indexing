<ABSTRACT>
A front-sealed rotary unit for the distribution of fluid under 
pressure, particularly for hydraulic motors having a double series of 

actuators operating on a shaft consisting of two eccentric portions 
staggered at 180째, such unit comprising a rotary distributor disc (8) 

connected to the drive shaft and tightly secured between a front-sealed 
reaction ring (9), capable of sliding axially and provided with 

separate passages (17, 20) connected to hydraulic fluid supply and 
discharge ducts (3a, 3b, 4), and a fixed distribution plate (5) 

provided with holes (6, 36) for the outflow from hydraulic fluid intake 
and discharge ducts (7/1, 7/2) to the two series of actuators (10) of 

the motor, in which such distributor disc (8) is traversed in an axial 
sense by at least two pairs of independent holes (27, 28, 33, 34) for 

communication between their opposed flat surfaces (8a, 8b), 
respectively in contact with reaction ring (9) and with distribution 

plate (5), which holes are capable of performing a double distribution 
in counterphase of fluid to the actuators with each revolution of 

distributor disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a front-sealed rotary unit capable of 
performing, with each revolution thereof, a (double) distribution in 
counterphase of fluid under pressure for the operation of radial-piston 
hydraulic motors having two series of actuators located on the same 
shaft. There are known in engineering radial-piston hydraulic motors which 
require, for the operation thereof, a rotary distributor which brings 
about in succession the supply to and discharge from the individual 
actuators, thereby causing rotary movement of the shaft of the said 
motor. There are also known designs in which it is advantageous to duplicate 
the series of actuators on the same drive shaft in order to obtain an 
increase of the driving torque without it being necessary to increase 
the radial dimensions of the casing in which they are housed.
 
The design of motors with two series of radial actuators normally 
provides for the two eccentric portions of the rotary shaft on which 
the actuators operate to be set in counterposition at 180째, in order to 
achieve dynamic balancing of the said shaft. Additionally, with the said phase displacement of 180째 between the two 
series of actuators there is obtained greater regularity of the output 
torque and, therefore, the possibility of obtaining angular velocities 
with fewer fluctuations at low speeds of rotation. Such rotary distribution unit of known type is substantially comprised  
 
of a rotary disc integral with the drive shaft and interposed between 
two housings in which are provided the openings of the hydraulic fluid 
supply and discharge ducts for the actuators; on the rotary disc are 
accordingly provided through-holes which place such openings in 
communication with the supply ducts of the individual actuators present 
in the double housing of the motor, thus bringing about the connection 
of a part thereof to the supply and of another part to the discharge. 
The front surfaces of the rotary disc should therefore slide rubbing 
against the flat surfaces of the housings between which they are 
located and in which are provided the hydraulic ducts to be connected, 
while at the same time providing a seal to avoid any possibility of 
drawing of the fluid through the various openings located on the faces 
of the distributor disc. The contact surfaces of the distributor disc and of the parts between 
which it is secured are therefore lapped by the hydraulic fluid in 
which the entire distribution unit is immersed. However, following the 
axial thrust
