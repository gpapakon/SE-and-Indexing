<ABSTRACT>
There are provided improved diagnostic metal containing molecular sieves for use as contrast agents in diagnostic imaging techniques such as X-ray, scintigraphy and, especially, MRI. For MRI the diagnostic metals are paramagnetic metal ions. Reduced risk of toxic metal release in vivo, especially into the GI tract, is achieved by surface modification of the molecular sieve.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTRAST MEDIAThis invention relates to the use of molecular sieves as contrast agents in diagnostic imaging procedures and in particular in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) .Contrast agents may be administered in medical imaging procedures, for example X-ray, magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging, to enhance the image contrast in images of a subject, generally a human or non-human animal body. The resulting enhanced contrast enables different organs, tissue types or body compartments to be more clearly observed or identified. In X-ray imaging the contrast agents function by modifying the X-ray absorption characteristics of the body sites in which they distribute; magnetic resonance contrast agents generally function by modifying the characteristic relaxation times Tj and T2 of the nuclei, generally water protons, from the resonance signals of which the images are generated; and ultrasound contrast agents function by modifying the speed of sound or the density in the body sites into which they distribute.The X-ray contrast agents first developed, barium sulfate and sodium iodide, have been superseded by iodinated organic compounds, in particular triiodophenyl compounds. Improvements in systemic toxicity over the last 40 years have also been achieved by the development of non-ionic iodinated X-ray contrast agents (see Shaw in "Radiopaques", CRC Handbook of Vitamins, Hormone and Radiopagues, CRC Press, p. 229-243) .As the X-ray absorption cross-sections of the elements generally increase with increasing atomic number and as such cross-sections are dependent on the wavelength of the X-rays there has been some desire to utilize the X- ray absorption properties of the lanthanides and other high atomic number metals to develop contrast agents with improved X-ray attenuation especially at the wavelengths 

 used in CT; however these attempts have generally been relatively unsuccessful.Thus, for example, Nalbandian et al. (see Ann. N.Y. Aσad. Sci. 78.: 779 (1959)) and Shapiro et al. (see Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 78_: 756 (1959)) proposed the use of the diethylenetetraaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate of bismuth (BiDTPA) and the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) chelate of lead (PbEDTA) as radiographic contrast agents but encountered problems of solubility and toxicity. In US-A-4176173 Winchell et al. described the use of simple hafnium or tantalum complexes as X-ray contrast agents and, more recently, ytterbium DTPA has been studied as an intravaεcular X-ray contrast agent and an DJO of 10 mmoles/kg
