<ABSTRACT>
A body (9) of a shadow mask having a skirt portion (11) around the
body, wherein cut parts (12) are formed in the skirt portion in the vicinity of

corner portions and center portions of the short sides and the length (13) of
the skirt portion in the corner portions is longer than the length (16) of the

skirt portion in the center portions of the short sides. This enables residual
distortion generated during welding with a mask frame and a thermal

expansion generated later to be absorbed at the skirt portion, thus
restraining the deformation generated by heating a curved surface (9') of the

shadow mask. As a result, it is possible to realize cost reduction and to
improve productivity in manufacturing a color picture tube without

deteriorating the color purity in the color picture tube by preventing the
thermal deformation of the curved surface (9') of a shadow mask during

manufacturing processes of the color picture tube without a dummy baking
process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shadow mask and a color picture tube containing the
shadow mask. Particularly, this invention relates to a shadow mask and a color
picture tube that can prevent the color purity in a color cathode-ray tube from
deteriorating, which is caused by the deformation of a curved surface of the body,
more particularly, a shadow mask and a color picture tube that can prevent
thermal deformation of the shadow mask during a thermal process in
manufacturing processes.A shadow mask according to the preamble of claim 1 is shown in FR 2 134 436.
This shadow mask has fixing points in the comer portion as well as in the center
portions of the skirt portion. The distances between each fixing point in the comer
portions and the curved surface of the shadow mask and between each fixing
point in the center portions of the short sides and the curved surface of the shadow
mask are equal.As shown in Fig. 4, a shadow mask type color picture tube includes a panel 1, a
shadow mask 2, a funnel 3, a deflecting yoke 4, a neck 5, an electron gun 6 and a
screen 8. The shadow mask 2 in Fig. 4 is provided for allowing electron beams 7
to land properly on the screen 8 by sorting the electron beams 7 emitted from the
electron gun 6.The shadow mask 2 is made up of a body 9 of a shadow mask and a mask frame
10 as shown in Fig. 5. The body 9 and the mask frame 10 are assembled by
welding a skirt portion 11 formed around the body and the inner surface of the 
mask frame 10 at the center positions of the long sides and short sides and at
comer portions of the shadow mask.Conventionally, the length L of the skirt portion 11 of the body 9 is almost the
same over the whole skirt portion, i. e. in each center portion of the sides and in
each comer portion, or in the case where a "boss" for reinforcing the mask frame
10 is provided in the inner part of each comer portion of the mask frame 10, in
order to avoid that the length of the skirt in each comer portion is shorter than the
length of the skirt in each center portion of the sides. In welding the body 9 and
the mask frame 10, the deformation of the skirt portion 11 relates greatly to the
deformation of the curved surface shape if the welding points are set at the upper
part of the skirt portion 11 (the side near the curved surface of the body 9). On the
other hand, there might be a case where the position of the welding points cannot
be secured due to an assembly error or the like in the case where the welding
points are set at the lower end part of the skirt portion

<CLAIMS>
A shadow mask, comprising a body (9) of a shadow mask (2) having a curved surface and having a
peripheral skirt portion (11) and short sides, and a mask frame (10)

surrounding the body, wherein cut parts (12) are formed in the skirt
portion (11) in the vicinity of comer portions and center portions of the

short sides of the body (9), the skirt portion (11) and the inner surface of the
mask frame (10) are fixed at least at the corner portions and the center

portions of the short sides

   
characterized in that

the distance between each fixing point in the comer portions and the curved
surface of the shadow mask (2) is longer than the distance between each

fixing point in the center portions of the short sides and the curved surface
of the shadow mask (2).
