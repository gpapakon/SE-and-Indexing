<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disperse dye
composition suitable for dyeing a fiber mixture product
comprising polyester fibers having different deniers,
particularly a combined filament yarn fabric or union
cloth product comprising fine denier polyester fibers and
regular denier polyester fibers (hereinafter referred to
simply as a different denier polyester fiber product).Dyeing of a different denier polyester fiber product
comprising fine denier polyester fibers of e.g. from 0.1d
to 0.7d and regular denier polyester fibers of e.g. from
1d to 5d is carried out usually by a conventional dyeing
method with a known disperse dye. However, such dyeing
has a problem that the dyed product has a color
difference between fibers in use (i.e. poor in solid
dyeing) or undergoes a substantial decrease in fastness.Due to the difference in the specific surface areas
of the constituting fibers, the different denier
polyester fiber product has a difference in the dyeing
behavior of the dye, whereby a color difference between 
fibers in use or a decrease in fastness will result. A
study is being made for a method of solving this problem
simply without providing a special process step.The present inventors have conducted extensive
studies on the above problem and as a result, have found
it possible to solve the above problem by using a
disperse dye composition comprising:
(1) a blue dye mixture comprising from 35 to 55 wt%
of a compound of the following formula (I), from 35 to 55
wt% of a compound of the following formula (II), and from
2 to 20 wt% of a compound of the formula (III) (the sum
of (I), (II) and (III) is 100 wt%):

wherein X1 is -CN or -NO2, R1 is a methyl group or an
ethyl group, and each of R2 and R3 which are independent
of each other, is a C2-C4 alkyl group,
 
and(2) at least one red dye selected from the group
consisting of compounds of the following formulas (IV-1)
and (IV-2):

wherein each of X2 and X3 which are independent of each
other, is -CN or a halogen atom, and each of R4, R5 and
R6 which are independent of each other, is a methyl group
or an ethyl group,
and/or(3) at least one yellow dye selected from the group
consisting of compounds of the following formula (V):

wherein each of X4 and X5 which are independent of each
other, is a halogen atom, and R7 is -C2H4CN or
-C2H4OCOC6H5.Now, the present invention will be described in 
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.In the blue dye mixture, the ratio of the dye of the
formula (I), the dye of the formula (II) and the dye of
