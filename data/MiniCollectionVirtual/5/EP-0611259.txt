<ABSTRACT>
Phthalocyanine compounds which contain a heterocyclic fibre-reactive radical correspond to the formula 

in which the symbols are as defined in the specification, which compounds are in free acid 
or salt form, and mixtures thereof, are useful for dyeing or printing hydroxy group- or 

nitrogen- containing organic substrates, for example leather and fibre material comprising 
natural or synthetic polyamides or natural or regenerated cellulose; the most preferred 

substrate is a textile material comprising cotton.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phthalocyanine compounds which contain a heterocyclic fibre-reactive
radical and a process for their production. These compounds are suitable as fibre-reactive
dyestuffs in any conventional dyeing or printing processes.In GB-A-2219804 and GB-A-2200364 such phthalocyanine compounds are disclosed having
halopyrimidine reactive groups. In the former case, the reactive group is a 5-cyanodichloropyrimidine
rest, in the latter case, the reactive group is a 2,4-dichloropyrimidine. In
either case, the reactive group contains no fluoro atoms.More particularly, the invention provides compounds of formula I
