<ABSTRACT>
A character font generation apparatus generates a font of a character
for the output of the character to an output unit (15). First, whether the

character specified through the operation of an input unit (14) can be
output in a desired font based on a predetermined resolution of the output

unit (15) or not is determined. If the result of determination indicates
"output not allowed", a stroke of the character is omitted to reduce the size

of the character to allow the correct output according to the predetermined
resolution. The stroke omission is performed with reference to contents of

a DB (database) memory (12) storing various information necessary for the
character font generation and a priority determination rule (131) indicating

various information for determining the priority of stroke omission, so as to
maintain the balance of the character such as center and centroid thereof

and to preserve the shape (contour) of the character.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
character font generation within limitation of character output media and a
computer readable storage medium storing a character font generation
program, and more particularly to a method and an apparatus for character
font generation and a computer readable storage medium storing a
character font generation program, for simplifying a collection of strokes
constituting a character according to the limitation of output media
receiving the character.In Nikkei Electronics, 1997. 4. 7 (no. 686), p.137-147, a technique for
developing a multi-gray scale Japanese font in dots by a method of surface
integral is described.In the method of surface integral, a gray-scale value of a character is
determined with use of an outline of the character, by first obtaining a
correction value based on a value of an area surrounded by the outline in
each pixel, and then determining a final gray-scale value by adding the
correction value to a predetermined basic gray-scale value.A method of developing dots with an intermediate gray-scale, such as
the above mentioned method of surface integral, however, cannot be
employed when the gray-scale level of dot is insufficient and in some cases
a generated character may be crushed or blurred as a whole and becomes
illegible.An object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a method
and an apparatus for character font generation capable of generating a
character font allowing an output of an easily recognizable character
regardless of limitation of character output media and a computer readable 
storage medium storing a character font generation program.To achieve the above mentioned object, the method of character font
generation according to the present invention includes the steps of
determining whether a character can be output in a desired font to an
output unit having a predetermined resolution, and of omitting a stroke of
the character so as to make the size of the character a size allowing output
thereof according to the predetermined resolution in response to the
determination of "output not allowed" in the step of determining. The
omission in the step of omitting is performed so as to maintain the balance
of the character and preserve the shape (contour) of the character.Thus, the stroke is omitted to allow the output of the character
according to the resolution of the output unit while the balance of the
character is maintained and the shape (contour) of character is preserved.
Therefore, the
