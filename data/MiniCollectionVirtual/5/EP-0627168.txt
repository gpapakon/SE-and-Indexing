<ABSTRACT>
A device for removing small bone remnants (O) from 
pieces of meat, for instance halves (M) of slaughtered animals 

such as pigs, and an apparatus for deboning these 
halves, wherein the device is embodied with at least two 

members (10,11) for closing and opening respectively toward and 
away from each other, each of which is provided with a 

contour cutting edge (17) which in the closed position of the 
members lie close together in order to remove a bone 

remnant as accurately as possible from the half for 
deboning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for removing small 
bone remnants from pieces of meat, for instance halves of 
slaughtered animals such as pigs, and to an apparatus for 
deboning these halves. Such an apparatus is described in an earlier application 
no. 9100400 in the name of applicant, with which 
it is possible to subject a half of a slaughtered animal 
to successive operations for removal of the ribs, spine 
and other bone parts. In the removal of the spine a saw-cut is made as 
closely as possible along the spine, wherein a bone 
remnant, that is, the protrusions of the vertebrae, 
remains behind in the meat. These bone parts or remnants, 
which are known as "meat eyes" in the relevant slaughtering 
art, must also be removed, for which purpose a proposal 
has been made for the use of a so-called hollow 
drill. Such a hollow drill operates inaccurately and does 
not remove the bone remnants sufficiently. Too much meat 
is also removed with such a device. The invention has for its object to obviate the 
above stated drawbacks and proposes to this end a device 
which is distinguished in that it is embodied with at 
least two members for closing and opening respectively 
toward and away from each other, each of which is provided 
with a contour cutting edge which in the closed position 
of the members lie together. Due to the use of members closing against each other 
the contour cutting edge related thereto can ensure that 
only the bone part is removed from the meat, wherein the 
severed bone part is held fast between the closed members 
so that a certain removal can take place. In a preferred embodiment the members are of cup-shaped 
form, wherein the contour cutting edge is arranged 
on the free edge of the cup. With cup-shaped members one 
bone remnant at a time can thus be taken hold of in the  
 
hollow space between the cup-shaped members, wherein the 
cutting edges provide severing of the meat, membranes and 
sinews therearound, doing so as closely as possible to 
the bone remnant. An exceptionally simple contour edge is obtained by 
grinding the edge of each cup-shaped member in facet 
form, whereby the bone surface is followed well and a 
good separation is achieved between bone and meat material. According to one embodiment the facet grinding on 
the one cup can herein face outward and that on the other 
cup can face inward, wherein the cutting edge of the 
inward facing facet grinding falls inside the cup-shaped 
space of the one member. A sort of shearing movement is 
effected herewith
