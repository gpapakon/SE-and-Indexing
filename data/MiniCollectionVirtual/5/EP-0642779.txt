<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a wound fluid absorbing article 
comprising a multi layer laminate having: 


a) wound contact layer with a high wet strength 
b) a core layer containing superabsorbent material 
c) a top surface layer of a material capable of 
stretching at least uniaxially. 
Such a dressing can achieve dimensional stability in the presence 
of wound exudate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to improved 
wound dressings having superior absorption and dimensional 
stability in a horizontal plane i.e., along the vertical x 
and y axes of the dressing. Two of the problems encountered 
in wound care treatment is keeping a wound clean and 
facilitating healing. The outer layer of human skin 
performs a protective function, which acts as a barrier to 
infection and as a means of regulating the body's heat and 
fluids between the body and the environment. When the skin 
is torn, punctured or damaged by being abraded, burnt or 
lacerated, this skin's protective function has been reduced. 
Such areas are conventionally protected by the application 
of a wound dressing, which covers the wound and acts to 
promote a moist healing environment. In wound treatment it is desirable to provide a 
wound dressing which will maintain the desired moist 
environment while preventing scab formation. In addition, 
the wound dressing must also permit removal of wound fluid 
which can build up between the dressing and the skin. A 
build up of fluid between the wound and the dressing can 
cause separation of the dressing from the skin. Separation 
of the dressing from the skin can increase the possibility  
 
of the wound being contaminated by microorganisms which can 
cause infection. Wound dressings are particularly important in the 
care of ulcers, particularly those that arise in the 
bedridden patients. One of the major problems in the health 
care of elderly patients is the treatment of ulcers, and 
pressure sores. Pressure sores and ulcers are often causes 
of pain, suffering, and infectious complications. The 
dressing of the present invention has particular application 
in the treatment of ulcers and other wounds. One type of dressing that has been commonly used 
as a wound dressing is an occlusive hydrocolloidal dressing. 
These dressings maintain a moist environment for the wound 
that is the ideal condition for granulation and healing. An 
hydrocolloidal dressing can also be useful in maintaining a 
suitable pH of the wound environment. The preferred pH is 
slightly acid, about a pH of 6.0. The slightly acid 
environment ensures that the cells responsible for the 
formation of granulation tissue, including myofibroblasts, 
endothelial cells, macrophages and platetets are functional. U.S. Patent No. 3,969,498 to Catania describes 
hydrocolloidal dressings which are plasma soluble and which 
form an artificial eschar at the wound site. These  
 
dressings are comprised of a
