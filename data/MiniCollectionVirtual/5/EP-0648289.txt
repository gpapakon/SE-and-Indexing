<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a paper colouring apparatus for especially water colours or water-based inks, wherein a driven running paper web (1) is positioned around a turning roller (2) constituting the counter pressure roller for an inker (3) and, together with the latter, are included in a roller train (4) adapted to convey ink (8) from a reservoir (9) to the inker (3). One has aimed at transferring ink to the paper (1) in so small amounts that after-drying of the paper (1) becomes unnecessary. According to the invention, said roller train (4) is adapted to be driven by means of the running paper web (1) and comprises five or more rollers (2, 3, 5, 6, 7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention related to a paper colouring apparatus 
for especially water colours or water-based inks, more 
specifically of the kind furter defined in the preamble of 
the following claim 1. Today, colouring paper in the form of a running web with 
water-based inks is effected by means of various kinds of 
colouring or painting apparatus and/or printing processes. The main disadvantage of methods of today is that relatively 
large amounts of ink (more than 1,5 grams/m2) are transferred 
to the paper web. As water well may constitute 90% of the ink, 
this will lead to a relatively large water supply to the 
paper, involving a swelling of the paper fibres; the physical 
properties (dimensional stability, rigidness, etc.) of the 
paper getting lost or being substantially deteriorated. In 
order to stabilize the paper again subsequent to such 
conventional colouring, it is necessary to after-dry it by 
means of suitable equipment (hot air blowing, radiation using 
infra red rays, microwave-treatment, etc.). Usually, this is 
expensive, space-demanding and complex. In a known colouring apparatus of the kind concerned, a 
colour roller rotates partly submerged into a colour basin, 
and cooperates with an overlying intermediate roller to which 
the colour roller transfers colouring matter. On its part, 
the intermediate roller transfers colouring matter supplied  
 
thereto to an overlying inking-up roller which is adapted to 
transfer colouring matter supplied thereto to a running paper 
web. These three rollers have mutually parallel rotation 
axes. It has been found that the adjustment of the relative 
positions of the rollers and pressure against each other 
greatly influence the amount of colour transferred between 
the rollers. A weak pressure from a roller gives another 
transferred colour amount than a hard roller pressure. 
Therefore, it is important that the pressure is constant 
along the line of contact between the rollers, in order to 
achieve an even colour transfer laterally of the paper web. In today's methods, the roller positions are usually adjusted 
by means of mechanical and/or electrical mechanisms, 
requiring much time and high professional capability. Usually, 
the adjustment have also to be tested out in order to control 
them. As the roller pressure influences the transferred amount of 
colour, it will also influence the amount of water 
transferred between the rollers when using water colours. 
This can lead to great problems adhering to the adjustment of 
the drying
