<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to abrasive grain having grinding aid coated 
thereon, abrasive products incorporating the abrasive grain therein, and methods 
of making the same. The abrasives industry generally concerns abrasive products comprising a 
binder and a plurality of abrasive grains. A variety of abrasive products are 
known, including coated abrasives, bonded abrasives, and nonwoven abrasives. In general, coated abrasive products comprise a substrate (or backing) 
having a layer of abrasive grains secured thereto by means of adhesive or binder. 
A bonded abrasive (e.g., a grinding wheel or a cutoff wheel) generally comprises 
a solid mass formed from abrasive grains and binder. Nonwoven (or three-dimension, 
low density) abrasives generally comprise abrasive grains bound onto 
and in a nonwoven fibrous substrate by means of binder or adhesive. Such abrasive products commonly include one or more grinding aids which 
improve performance characteristics of the abrasives. Such performance 
characteristics include cut rate, coolness of cut, product wear, and product life. 
Known grinding aids include sodium cryolite, calcium fluoride, ammonium 
cryolite, sodium fluoroborate, potassium tetrafluoroborate, iron sulfide, potassium 
aluminum fluoride, and ammonium chloride. The present invention provides an abrasive grain comprising: 
(i) an abrasive particle having an outer surface; and (ii) grinding aid material bonded to the outer surface via 
interparticle attraction. The present invention also provides a method of making the same, 
wherein the method comprises the step of mixing a plurality of abrasive 
particles with a sufficient amount of a grinding aid for a time sufficient to 
provide the abrasive grain. Typically, the abrasive particles have an average 
particle size in the range from about 10 to about 4000 micrometers, more 
typically, in the range from about 20 to about 4000 micrometers, and, most 
typically, in the range from about 50 to about 2000 micrometers. A preferred 
abrasive particle is a sintered alpha alumina-based ceramic particle. In another aspect, the present invention provides abrasive grains each 
comprising sintered ceramic particles having an average particle size within the 
range of about 10 to about 4000 micrometers (typically about 20 to about 4000 
micrometers, more typically, about 50 to about 2000 micrometers), each 
particle comprising: 
(i) a sintered alpha alumina-based ceramic core (or particle) having 
a surface area; (ii) a coating of inorganic particulates
