<ABSTRACT>
A high-permeability core (10) has four legs (11a-d) of a 
quadrangular prism shape. An exciting coil (20) has 

a first winding (21) that is wound on two adjacent 
legs of the core, and a second 

winding (22) connected to the first winding and wound on the other 
two adjacent legs in the direction opposite to the winding 

direction of the first winding. A detecting coil (30) has a 
structure (31,32) similar to that of the exciting coil, and oriented 

orthogonally thereto. The sensor is disposed adjacent to a 
rotary shaft such that a long side of each winding of the 

exciting coil is parallel to the axial direction of the rotary 
shaft. The core is produced by forming a cruciform groove in 

a rectangular parallelepiped core block from its one face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetostrictive 
torque sensor and a magnetostrictive torque measuring 
apparatus, as well as to a condition-monitoring apparatus for 
a cutting tool. A magnetostrictive stress (torque) sensor makes use of 
a phenomenon in which magnetic permeability changes when a 
mechanical strain is imparted to a ferromagnetic material, the 
phenomenon being one of the phenomena of magnetic strain. The 
magnetostrictive torque sensor is arranged such that a rotary 
shaft for the detection of torque is formed by a ferromagnetic 
material such as iron, and two U-shaped coils (each arranged by 
winding a coil around open-side opposite legs of a U-shaped 
core), which form a bridge in such a manner as to oppose side 
surfaces of the shaft member, are disposed in a crossing 
manner. Further, one core is disposed parallel to the axial 
direction of the rotary shaft, and the other core is disposed 
in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction. In other 
words, the legs of the two cores are positioned at vertices of 
a square, but the sides of the square are positioned in such a 
manner as to be inclined 45 degrees with respect to the axial 
direction of the rotary shaft.  If torque is applied to the rotary shaft in this state, 
the rotary shaft is twisted and a tensile stress and a 
compressive stress occur in a direction offset ±45 degrees with 
respect to the center line of the shaft. As a result, the 
magnetic permeability at the rotary shaft changes. With 
respect to the change of permeability, an a.c. current is 
allowed to flow across one of the two U-shaped coils to excite 
it, and a signal is fetched from the other coil, so as to 
detect the change in permeability and determine the torque on 
the basis of the result of detection thereof. With the above-described conventional sensor, however, 
the following problems are encountered. Namely, the magnetic 
pole portions have a magnetic path which include an open end of 
the exciting core, the interior of the shaft subject to 
measurement, an open end of the detecting core, the interior of 
the detecting core, the other open end of the detecting core, 
the interior of the shaft subject to measurement, and the other 
open end of the exciting core. Since the exciting core and the 
detecting core are arranged in a crossing state, there are two 
systems of the aforementioned magnetic path, and the torque is 
detected as the magnetic permeability in the respective 
magnetic paths changes differentially with respect to the 
direction
