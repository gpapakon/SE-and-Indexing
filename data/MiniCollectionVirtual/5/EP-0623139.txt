<ABSTRACT>
Avian cDNA nucleotide sequences for use as hybridization probes are provided. Probes derived from the sequences find use in defining the sex of a bird, usually by producing hybridization patterns that are sex-specific for most avian species. For a given avian species the probes may hybridize to both Z and W chromosomes so as to differentiate between the two chromosomes on the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Alternatively, the probes may hybridize exclusively to one of the two sex chromosomes in some species. The hybridization probes taught are also useful for the isolation of other nucleotide sequences that may be used to generate sex-specific hybridization patterns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of restriction
fragment length polymorphism markers suitable for sex
identification in avian species, and methods for using
such markers.RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism)
analysis has proven highly successful in mapping and
discovering new genes in eukaryotic organisms. RFLP
marker probes consist of polynucleotide sequences that
specifically hybridize to a region of the chromosome.
These chromosomal regions of hybridization are revealed
to be polymorphic between individuals of the same
species when the chromosomal DNA is digested by
restriction endonucleases and analyzed by hybridization
analysis. Different RFLP alleles are distinguished
from one another on the basis of the hybridization
banding patterns produced after size separation.
Genetic linkage analysis between RFLP markers and
uncharacterized genes has proven to be a useful
technique for isolating and mapping uncharacterized
genes of interest. Although the RFLP marker has most
frequently been used to identify the chromosomal
disruptions responsible for genetic diseases, it is
also of interest to use RFLP markers in deciphering 
other complex genetic regulatory questions, such as
sexual development in animals.While the genetics and biochemistry of sex
determination in mammals has been the subject of
extensive scientific investigation, similar studies
have not been carried out with respect to birds. This
is surprising in view of the commercial importance of
numerous avian species e.g., chickens and turkeys. It
is of interest to provide research tools useful for
deciphering the complex process of genetic sex
determination in birds. Sex-specific genetic markers
are of particular interest. Such markers may be used
to sexually identify immature birds prior to the
development of gender specific morphological
differences. Early sexual identification is an
important consideration when breeding those birds that
become sexually mature prior to the development of
external sexual characteristics. Accordingly, there is
interest in providing methods for preventing undesired
matings by permitting gender identification (and gender
separation) prior to the development of sexual
maturity.Genetic sexual identification is also useful in the
breeding of rare bird species with unidentified
secondary sexual characteristics; captive breeding
programs may thus be effectively organized.Sex chromosomes, as opposed to autosomal chromosomes,
differ with respect to one another in size and genetic
composition. Thus, some
