<ABSTRACT>
A wall tie (10) including, in a region to be received within a mortar 
course, a 

surface (17
a
,17
b
) angled to the plane of the mortar 
course in which it is 

to be embedded in such a direction that the application of a force to the 
tie (10) to move the tie in the mortar course in the direction of the 

length of 
the tie (10) results in a wedging action tending to separate the brick 

or block 
courses above and below the tie so that such movement is resisted inter 

alia by the weight of that part of the wall above the wall tie (10) 
acting thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wall tie for securing a brick or block built wall
to a support structure, for example for securing one leaf of a cavity wall
construction to the other leaf thereof (cf. GB-A-2 260 348).Wall ties are generally arranged to be embedded in the mortar course
positioned between the courses of bricks or other building blocks used in
the construction of a cavity wall in order to secure the tie to the
construction. One common problem with many known wall ties is that
if they are subject to forces tending to withdraw the tie from between
courses of the wall, the resistance to such a force is relatively low, and
movement of the wall tie occurs, followed by fracture of the mortar
course.It is an object of the invention to provide a wall tie in which the above
described problem is reduced.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a wall tie
comprising an elongate member having a central portion and first and
second opposite end portions integral therewith, at least said first end
portion being arranged to be embedded in a mortar course between
brick or block courses of a wall or leaf of a wall, and, said wall tie being
characterised in that said first end portion includes an elongate region of
V-shaped cross-section the width and depth of which increases from a
minimum at the end of the region adjacent said central portion. The wall tie preferably comprises a shaped metal strip, preferably a
stainless steel strip.Preferably the region of V-shaped cross-section is part of a region of
inverted W-shaped cross-section.The wall tie may include a generally flat region between the central
region and the first end region to facilitate manual bending allowing
vertical adjustment of the wall tie.The wall tie preferably further includes an upstanding wall extending
generally perpendicularly to the length of the wall tie.Preferably, the upstanding wall subtends an angle of 85 to 90° with the
horizontal, in use.Preferably, the upstanding wall defines part of the boundary of an
aperture provided in the wall tie.The invention will further be described by way of example with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a side view of a wall tie according to a first embodiment of
the invention;Figure 2 is a plan view of the wall tie of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a side view of a wall tie according to a second embodiment;Figure 4 is a plan view of the embodiment of Figure 3;Figure 5 is side view of a wall tie according to a third embodiment; andFigure 6 is a plan view of part

<CLAIMS>
A wall tie comprising an elongate member having a central
portion (12) and first and second opposite end portions integral

therewith, at least said first end portion being arranged to be embedded
in a mortar course between brick or block courses of a wall or leaf of a

wall, and, said wall tie being characterised in that said first end portion
includes an elongate region (17) of V-shaped cross-section the width and

depth of which increases from a minimum at the end of the region (17)
adjacent said central portion (12).
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by being formed
as a shaped metal strip.
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized in
that said region of V-shaped cross-section is part of a region of said first

end portion of an inverted W-shaped cross-section.
A wall tie as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
by a generally flat region (42) between said central portion and said first

end portion to facilitate manual bending allowing vertical adjustment of
the wall tie.
A wall tie as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
by an upstanding wall (22, 48) extending generally perpendicularly to

the length of the wall tie. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the
upstanding wall (22, 48) subtends an angle of 85 to 90° with the

horizontal, in use.
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, characterized in
that the upstanding wall (22) defines part of the boundary of an aperture

(20) provided in the wall tie.
