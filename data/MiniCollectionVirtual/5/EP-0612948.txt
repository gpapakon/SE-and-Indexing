<ABSTRACT>
Spring clamping band made up of a band of metal (1) wound up on itself, the terminal portions (1a-1b) of the said band each having a width substantially equal to half the width of the band, being located one beside the other and being provided with tabs (2-3), pointing radially towards the outside of the collar, forming bearing surfaces for a tool of the pliers type, whilst the band exhibits a cross-section in the shape of a flattened V such that the central region of the internal surface of the collar has a diameter which is less than that of its lateral regions. The angle formed by the two arms of the V lies between 120@ and 165@, and the ratio between the thickness e of the band and the length L of each arm itself lies between 0.2 and 0.5.
