<ABSTRACT>
Multi-cavity injection molding apparatus with hot 
tip gates (16) extending perpendicular to the direction of mold 

opening to provide very clean shearing action. The heated 
nozzles (10) extend diagonally outward in two rows from a pair 

of diagonal surfaces (22,24) extending along an elongated melt 
distribution manifold (12). Each nozzle (10) has a pointed tip (96) 

extending outwardly at an angle (B) to its longitudinal axis (56) in 
alignment with one of the gates (16). The outward angles (A,B) of the 

nozzles (10) themselves and their pointed tips (96) enable the gates (16) 
to be oriented parallel to the parting line (58) and 

perpendicular to the direction of mold opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection molding apparatus according to the preamble of
claim 1.Injection molding simultaneously through a number
of gates to a number of different cavities is well known in
the art and is referred to as multi-cavity molding. It is
well known to do this using a number of hot tip gated
nozzles to convey melt out from a common melt distribution
manifold or using a single edge gated nozzle to convey melt
to a number of surrounding gates. Examples of edge gated
nozzles are shown in the applicants' U.S. Patent Number
4,344,750 which issued August 17, 1982 and in Figure 4 of
U.S. Patent Number 5,217,730 to Teng which issued June 8,
1993. These configurations have the advantage that the
gates extend parallel to the parting line or perpendicular
to the direction of mold opening and thus provide very
clean shearing at the gate when the parts are demolded from
the cavities. However, in addition to not being hot tip
gated, they have the serious disadvantage for many larger
cavity applications that the gates must be located
relatively close together around the single nozzle between
them. This space restriction limits the extent and
location of cooling which can be provided adjacent the
cavities which is important for fast cycles. It also
limits the position of the gate on the cavity which is
important in other situations to avoid undue core shift.An example of a number of hot tip gated nozzles
extending out from a common melt distribution manifold is
shown in U.S. Patent Number 4,768,945 to Schmidt et al. 
which was issued September 6, 1998.From US-A-4,768,945, an injection molding nozzle is known. Said hot tip gated
nozzle is arranged substantially perpendicular to the related parting line, wherein
said pointed tip and the related gate is arranged in-line with the main axis of the
related nozzle. Moreover, from said prior art document a further nozzle with a nose
portion being inclined with regard to the main axis of the nozzle is known. Said nose
portion is also inclined with the related parting line. The gate related to said nose
portion is arranged in a direction being parallel to the parting line mentioned above.
While avoiding the above disadvantages of edge gating, this configuration has the
disadvantage that the hot tip gates cannot be oriented to extend to a portion of the
cavity wall which is perpendicular to the parting line to produce the shearing effect of
edge gating.An example of nozzles extending diagonally outwardly from a common manifold is
shown in Figure 28 of
