<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of producing deep bores, in particular in wood. In this method, misdirection of the drill is prevented and adequate chip removal is ensured. Intended for use in this method is a deep-bore drill comprising two hollow shafts (21, 22) fitted with cutter elements, the hollow shafts being fitted concentrically one inside the other and being rotatable independently of each other. Incorporated in this deep-boring drill are channels (24, 25) for the supply and return of compressed air which not only cools the drill but also removes the chips from the drill hole.

A method for producing deep holes, particularly in wood and 
similar structural materials, characterized in that two drilling 

members (21, 22) arranged concentrically within one another and 
constructed as hollow shanks with ends having cutting members (224) 

are operated at different speeds, the inner drilling member (22) 
trailing behind the outer drilling member (21). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the outer 
drilling member (21) is operated at a lower speed than the inner 

drilling member (22). 
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that the speed 
of the inner drilling member (22) is 10 to 200 times higher than the 

speed of the outer drilling member (21). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that a cooling 
and transfer medium is introduced between the drilling members (21, 

22) from the outside, that said cooling and transfer medium then 
flows between the drilling members (21, 22) up to the drilling point 

and from there flows back in the core of the inner drilling member 
(22) entrained with removed material. 
A deep hole drill for performing the method according to claim 1, 
comprising two independently rotatable hollow shanks (21, 22) 

arranged concentrically within one another, one end of each of these 
having cutting members, the end of the inner hollow shank (22) 

provided with the cutting members being set back with respect to the 
end of the outer hollow shank (21). 
A deep hole drill according to claim 5, characterized in that 
between the hollow shanks (21, 22) is at least one supply channel (24)  

 
for a cooling and transfer medium and the core of the inner hollow 

shank has a removal channel (25) for said cooling and transfer 
medium. 
A deep hole drill according to claim 5, characterized in that 
an area of the outer hollow shank (21) has openings (21'') for the 

supply of the cooling and transfer medium. 
A deep hole drill according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the inner hollow shank (22), from the same area and up to its cutting 

members, has symmetrically arranged, circumferentially distributed 
longitudinal grooves (222). 
A deep hole drill according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the hollow shanks (21, 22) are in multipart form. 
A deep hole drill according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the cutting member of the outer hollow shank (21) is constructed as 

a drill bit (21'). 
A deep hole drill according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the cutting member of the inner hollow shank (22) is constructed as 

a hollow cylindrical core drill (22'). 
A deep hole drill according to claim 11, characterized in that 
the core drill (22') has a cutting lip (224) diagonally bridging 

the hollow cylinder and with cutting edges (224') approximately 
perpendicular to the drill axis. 
A deep hole drill according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the core drill (22') has two peripheral shoulder portions (223) 

provided with cutting edges and which are in each case turned by 

90Â° with respect to the cutting lip (224) and that the cutting 
lip (224) projects over the shoulder portions (223).  

 
A deep hole drill according to claims 13 and 8, characterized 
in that at least one of the symmetrically distributed longitudinal 

grooves (222') around the circumference of the core drill (22') 
extends over and beyond the peripheral shoulder portions (223) 

and that in each case one V-shaped branched longitudinal groove 
(222') emerges at a step of the cutting lip (224) on the hollow 

cylinder. 
A deep hole drilling machine, which is provided with a deep 
hole drill according to claim 5. 
A deep hole drilling machine according to claim 15, characterized 
in that its drive motor (1) has a hollow shaft. 
A deep hole drilling machine according to claim 16, characterized 
in that the inner hollow shank (22) projects to either side of the 

drive motor (1) and the free end of its cutting member is open. 
A deep hole drilling machine according to claim 17, characterized 
in that its deep hole drill (2) is displaceably mounted in a rigid 

guide member (3) positioned close to the workpiece (W). 
A deep hole drilling machine according to claim 18, characterized 
in that it is provided with a standard feed mechanism (B) for such 

purposes.
