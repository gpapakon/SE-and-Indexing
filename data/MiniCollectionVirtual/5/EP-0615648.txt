<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for actively controlling
and quieting repetitive noise arising from one or
more noise sources comprising an enclosure means provided
with multiple openings and surrounding said one or more noise
sources, one or more speaker means adapted to cause deadening
of sound generated from said noise sources, microphone means
adapted to receive noise and to generate electrical signals
in response thereto, contoller means connected to said
speaker means and adapted to receive signals from said residual
microphone means.The repetitive phenomena being cancelled in certain other
cases may be unwanted physical vibrations, with vibration
sensors and counter vibration actuators as the repetitive
phenomena sensors and cancelling actuators, respectively.Such a system is known both from US-A-4,989,252 and WO
89/07701. US-A 4,989,252 discloses a silencer for refrigerators
to deaden the sound from a motor-compressor mounted in a
machine compartment. It includes a one-dimensional active
noise cancellation system comprising one speaker means, one 
microphone means, and a controller means. The machine compartment
is closed with a ventilating opening left open. One
of the dimensions of the machine compartment in the three-dimensional
directions is set at a value larger than those of
the others so that a standing wave of the sound from the motor-compressor
in the machine compartment is composed only in
a primary mode in a low frequency range below 700Hz. The ventilating
opening is extending in the direction perpendicular
to the direction the standing wave travels, so that the latter
cannot exit.WO 89/07701 discloses an active noise attenuation system for
an exhaust system of a combustion engine and the like. This
active sound attenuation system consists of a digital controller,
a single microphone and a single sensor means. The
sensor means is providing an input signal to the digital controller
which generates in response to that input signal an
anti-noise signal utilizing a time domain or frequency domain
algorithm. This anti-noise signal is sent through a power amplifier
to speakers generating a counter noise. The effect of
the anti-noise signal is probed by a single residual microphone
which picks up the actual sound wave pattern and provides
a second signal to the controller. In response to this
second signal, the anti-noise generating algorithm utilized
by the controller is adjusted in a way that the signal at the
residual microphone is as small as possible.A time domain approach to
