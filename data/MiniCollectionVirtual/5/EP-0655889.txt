<DESCRIPTION>
In the prior art, known so far, two types of bakery 
custards are disclosed, i.e. 
(1) a traditional bakery custard, comprising ingredients 
such as whole-milk, sugar, native starch and egg-white 
and/or egg-yolk. Although these custards are of high 
quality they have a number of disadvantages. E.g.: these 
custards are not ready-to-use; i.e. before the application 
of these custards they need to be cooked in order to 
gelatinize the starch and to be cooled again afterwards; 
further the shelf-life of those products is short, i.e. 
about 3 days at 5°C, which is due to the fact that the 
products can only be pasteurized and not sterilized. (2) an instant bakery custard, comprising whole milk 
powder, sugar, modified starch (cold-gelling) and 
hydrocolloids. However, these instant custards are in 
powder form and need to be mixed with water and have to 
stand for a considerable time (at least 15 mins) before 
application, so that they are not ready-to-use products. 
Further, as the products can not be sterilized, the shelf-life 
is only about 3 days at 5°C. Moreover the consistency 
of above two custards is such, that they are gels both at 
ambient and at higher (above 60°C) temperatures. Unless the fact that pourable custards, which are not 
suitable for bakery application, because its viscosity is 
too low, were also known, bakery custards which are ready-to-use 
and which have a long shelf-life, a high quality, a 
suitable consistency in order to be able to remove them 
from the packaging material, which are pipeable at filling 
temperature, have good eating properties, such as short 
texture, freshness and frank taste, were not developed.  
 In DE-A-33 19 072, sterilized compositions comprising milk, in 
particular cream are disclosed which are obtained by regulation 
of the pH at 6.6-6.8 by use of salts like sodium carbonate, 
sodium phosphate or sodium citrate, subsequent heating and 
homogenizing.  
 As such bakery custards would provide a high convenience 
for the consumer, in particular for the bakers, such 
custards are highly desired. 
In our research to develop such custards, we found that 
ready-to-use bakery custards with a long shelf-life and 
without having to apply a preservative are obtained, when 
these custards have the following composition: 
(i) 65-95 wt% of a water continuous fat emulsion with a 
fat content of 0.1-10 wt% and containing 0.01-8 wt% of a 
protein (ii) 0.01-20 wt% of a sweetener (iii) 2-10 wt% of a modified starch, suitable for UHT-conditions (iv) 1-5 wt% of a gelatin
