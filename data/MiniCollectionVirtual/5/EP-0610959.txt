<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus includes a 
full-line type recording head (17) having plural ejection 

outlets (7); a shaft (18) for rotatably supporting the 
recording head (17) between a recording position in which 

the ink is ejected in a non-vertical direction and a 
non-recording position in which the ink is ejected 

substantially vertically; a device, disposed adjacent 

a recording position of the recording head (17), 
contributable to feeding of the recording material; 

and a positioning plate press-contacted to the 
contributable device to confine the recording material (1) 

in cooperation with the contributable device to 
confine a recording surface of the recording material (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Particularly the present invention relates to an ink jet 
recording apparatus using a 
so-called full-line type recording 
head which has plural ink ejection outlets covering an 
entire recording width. Recording machines are classified depending on 
the recording method into an ink jet type, a wire dot 
type, a thermal type and a laser beam type. In a 
recording apparatus such as a printer, a copying 
machine or a facsimile machine of these types, a 
desired image is recorded on a recording material in 
the form of a thin sheet of paper or plastic material 
in accordance with information supplied thereto. In 
the ink jet recording type apparatus, droplets of ink 
is ejected through ejection outlets of the recording 
head and are deposited onto the recording material so 
as to effect recording of the images. Particularly, in the system wherein droplets 
of ink is ejected by pressure caused by film boiling of 
the ink resulting from the thermal energy, the ink 
passages including heat generating resistors can be 
produced using film forming technique, and therefore, 
the system is most suitable for high density, and 
therefore, a high speed recording.  
 Referring to Figure 1, there is shown in a 
perspective view a line recording head used in the ink 
jet recording apparatus. The recording head 17 is 
generally comprised of a main body 17a containing heat 
generating portions, electric parts and ink chamber 
made of glass, a first filter 30a and a second filter 
30b, and a front plate 31, which are disposed outside 
the main body. The first and second filters 30a and 
30b has first and second connectors 32a and 32b and are 
connected with an ink supplier with ink supply cubes 
with hermetical seal. Chain line 7 is a line 
connecting centers of ejection outlets. As will be 
understood, an image can be formed over an entire width 
of the recording material by the scan in the major 
scanning direction, by the ejection outlets 7a. The 
ejection outlets have several tends microns diameter 
and is in communication with the ink supply tube by way 
of ink passages and ink supply chambers. Here, the 
other ends of the ink supply tube are connected with 
unshown first and second supply pipe. The head front 
plate 31 is made of metal or plastic resin material 
molded. Between the ejection outlet side surface 7a 
and the front plate 31, silicone rubber or the like 
establishes hermetical seal. The first and second

position of said recording head (17) and contributable to feed 

a recording material (1)
 
   
characterized by
a positioning member (16) in the form of a plate press-contacted 
to said feeding means (13) to cooperate with said 

feeding means to confine a recording surface of said recording 
material (1), wherein the recording position is adjacent to an 

edge of said positioning member. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, further 
comprising a shaft (18) for rotatably supporting 

said recording head (17) between a recording 
position in which the ink ejected in a non-vertical 

direction and a non-recording position in which the 
ink is ejected substantially vertically. 
An apparatus according to claim 2, further 
comprising a tray (19) below said recording head 

(17), said tray being provided with a cleaning  
 

member (20) for cleaning an ejection outlet side 
surface (7a) of the recording head and a capping 

means (21) for capping the ejection side surface, 
in a movement path of the recording head between 

the recording position and the non-recording 
position. 
An apparatus according to claim 3,
characterized in that
 
said tray (19) is large enough to cover a movable 

range of said recording head (17) and also 
functions to receive the ink leaked from said 

recording head (17). 
An apparatus according to claim 4,
characterized in that
 
said tray (19) is provided with a collector (23) 

for collecting the leaked ink with an inclined 
surface, wherein said collector is detachably 

mounted to said tray. 
An apparatus according to claim 3,
characterized in that
 
a lower portion of said tray (19) is used as a
