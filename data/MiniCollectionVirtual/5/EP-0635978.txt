<ABSTRACT>
A digitally inputted image signal (SD signal) is converted into a high resolution digital image signal (HD 
signal) by using estimated values. The specific pixels of an object to be estimated are classified according to the one-, 

two-, or three-dimension level distribution of plural reference pixels of SD signal located near the specific pixels. The 
estimated values of the specific pixels are generated by a linear combination of the values of the reference values and 

the estimation coefficients determined in advance by learning. During the learning, a known HD signal and the SD 
signal formed from it are used to determine the estimation coefficients so as to minimize the sum of squares of the 

errors between the true values and the values estimated by the linear combination of the values of the surrounding SD 
signal reference pixels and the estimated coefficients. Not necessarily limited to the estimated 
coefficients, it may be 
possible to use, as the estimated values, representatives determined for every class in correspondence with the class 

of the inputted SD signal. The reference value of a block and the value normalized by the dynamic range DR are an 
example as the representatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
signal converting apparatus suitable for so-called up-conversion
where an image signal with a standard
resolution is converted into an image signal with a
high resolution.For example, in the case of TV signals, in
addition to standard resolution (or standard definition
SD) TV signals, high definition (or high definition HD)
TV signals have been experimentally used for
broadcasting. TV receivers that can receive HD signals
have been practically used. In other words, the HD TV
system is going to coexist with the SD TV system.When the SD TV system and the HD TV system
coexist, a signal converting apparatus for allowing an
HD TV monitor to reproduce SD TV video signals will be
required. Although various standards for the SD
signals and the HD signals have been proposed, now
assume an NTSC system for SD signals (number of
scanning lines = 525, number of fields = 60, aspect
ratio = 4 : 3) and an HDTV system for HD signals
(number of scanning lines = 1125, number of fields =
60, aspect ratio = 16 : 9). The resolution of the HD 
signals is four times higher than the resolution of the
SD signals. Thus, the converting apparatus should
perform an up-converting process that increases the
number of pixels of the input SD signal four times so
as to obtain the resolution of an HD signal.Conventionally, the signal converting
apparatus uses interpolating filters. Fig. 1 shows a
block diagram of a conventional signal up-converting
apparatus. An SD signal is supplied from an input
terminal 1. The SD signal is sent to a horizontal
interpolating filter 2 that increases the number of
pixels of the SD signal twice in horizontal direction.
The output of the horizontal interpolating filter 2 is
sent to a vertical interpolating filter 3 that
increases the number of pixels of the output signal of
the horizontal interpolating filter 2 twice in vertical
direction. The output of the vertical interpolating
filter 3 is an HD signal. The HD signal is sent to an
output terminal 4. In the conventional signal
converting apparatus, the image is up-converted with
such filters. For example, 0 data is inserted into an
interpolating point so that the sampling frequency of
the SD signal accords with the sampling frequency of
the HD signal. An interpolated value corresponding to
the interpolating point is formed by each filter.Fig. 2 shows a construction of each of the
interpolating filters. An SD signal is supplied to an 
input terminal 5. The SD signal is sent to multipliers that multiply the SD signal
