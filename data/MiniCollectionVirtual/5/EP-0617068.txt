<ABSTRACT>
Rigid foams containing urethane and optionally isocyanurate groups are prepared by reacting     a) mixtures of polyisocyanates with pentane and/or isopentane with b) compounds having a molecular weight of from 400 to 10,000 and containing at least two hydrogen atoms which are reactive towards isocyanates, and c) optionally compounds having a molecular weight of 32-399 and containing at least two hydrogen atoms which are reactive towards isocyanates, optionally in the presence of d) further blowing agents and auxiliaries and additives known per se,   and are used as insulating materials.
