<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel phosphonosulfonate compounds. This
invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these novel
compounds, as well as to methods for treating or preventing metabolic bone
disorders characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism by
utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.
Specifically, this invention relates to methods for treating or preventing
osteoporosis, or arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, by
utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.A number of pathological conditions which can afflict humans and warm
blooded animals involve abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism. Such
conditions may be divided into two broad categories:
(1) Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobilization of
calcium and phosphate leading to general or specific bone loss,
such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease, or excessively high
calcium and phosphate levels in the fluids of the body, such as
hypercalcemia of tumor origin. Such conditions are sometimes
referred to herein as pathological hard tissue demineralizations.(2) Conditions which cause or result from deposition of calcium and
phosphate anomalously in the body, such as arthritis, including
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. These conditions are
sometimes referred to herein as pathological calcifications.The first category includes the most common metabolic bone disorder,
osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone hard tissue is lost
disproportionately to the development of new hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be
generally defined as the reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of
skeletal tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding
decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be subclassified
as menopausal, senile, drug-induced (e.g. adrenocorticoid, as can occur in 
steroid therapy); disease-induced (arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the
manifestations are essentially the same.In general, there are two types of osteoporosis: primary and secondary.
"Secondary osteoporosis" is the result of a separate disease process or agent.
However, approximately 90% of all osteoporosis cases are "primary
osteoporosis". Such primary osteoporosis includes postmenopausal
osteoporosis, disuse osteoporosis, age-associated osteoporosis (affecting a
majority of individuals over the age of 70 to 80), and idiopathic osteoporosis
affecting middle-aged and
