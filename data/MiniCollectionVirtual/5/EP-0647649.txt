Crystal D or E of 1-hydroxy-2-(imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridin-3-yl)ethane-1,1-bis(phosphonic acid) monohydrate having specified 

lattice spacing and relative intensity in the powder X-ray diffraction spectrum obtained by using Cu-Kα radiation and a dehydration 
peak temperature of 135-149 °C or 160-170 °C according to TG-DSC thermogravimetric analysis; and a solid pharmaceutical 

preparation containing the same. The crystals are useful for producing a stable solid preparation of the above compound 
which has an excellent drug efficacy for diseases wherein increased bone resorption participates, such as osteoporosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel crystals D and E of
a novel monohydrate of 1-hydroxy-2-(imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethane-1,1-bis(phosphonic
acid) [to be referred to as
compound (I) hereinafter] and to a stable solid
pharmaceutical preparation containing the same.Compound (I) is a compound represented by the
following formula (I), which has excellent bone resorption
inhibitory activity, anti-inflammatory activity and
analgesic-antipyretic activity and is useful for the
treatment of diseases in which increased bone resorption
participates, such as Paget's disease, hypercalcemia, bone
metastasis of cancer and osteoporosis, as well as progress in
the bone resorption (induction of osteoporosis) caused by
inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
the like (cf. JP-A-2-138288). (The term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application.) 
Example 5 in the aforementioned published patent
application describes that this free acid compound (I) is
isolated and purified in the form of colorless needle
crystals which are obtained by recrystallization from water-methanol,
and the thus obtained crystals contain 0.5 mole of
water according to the result of elemental analysis.However, the aforementioned published patent
application does not have description about certain
properties of the crystal obtained in the Example 5 which are
not desirable when compound (I) is made into a pharmaceutical
preparation, about the presence of compound (I) monohydrate
which has two novel crystalline forms and about utility of
the novel monohydrate crystals.According to the studies conducted by the inventors
of the present invention, it was confirmed that the
crystalline form of the crystal produced in accordance with
the procedure described in Example 5 of the aforementioned
published patent application (to be referred to as crystal C
hereinafter, Lot No. 49-1 in the table) was physically
unstable, because it has such a strong hygroscopic property
that it absorbs 1% of moisture in a day under a relative 
humidity condition of 93% (cf. crystal C in Table 3) and the
crystalline form was changed and converted into monohydrate
in the presence of water (cf. Test Example 3 which will be
described later). In consequence, it was revealed that this
crystal has serious problems in putting it into practical use
as a solid pharmaceutical preparation because of various
limitations in the preservation of the crystal and in the
pharmaceutical manufacturing steps.When the crystal C was examined in
