<ABSTRACT>
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and knitwork with 
improved suction and cleaning, comprising a load-bearing structure 

with two sidepieces (10) supporting at least one drum (11) which 
rotates about a central shaft (12) and supports on its two lateral 

endpieces (11a, 11b) two series of teaseling and/or fluffing 
rollers of with-pile type (13) and against-pile type (14) arranged 

along the generators of the drum (11) with those of one series 
rotating relative to those of the other under independent drive, a 

fabric (15) to be treated passing about the teaseling and/or 
fluffing rollers (13, 14) and being fed to the machine by a driven 

feed roller (16) and extracted therefrom by a driven exit roller 
(17), there being provided brushes (19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) which 

interact alternately with the teaseling and/or fluffing rollers 
(13, 14), wherein a suction unit associated with apertures (37) 

provided in a sidepiece (10) of said load-bearing structure  
 

creates a suction within said drum (11) to collect the fibres and 
dust generated during operation. The brushes are specifically 

divided into two mutually interacting groups of two (19a, 20a; 
19b, 20b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a teaseling and/or fluffing machine for
fabric and knitwork with improved suction and cleaning.Known teaseling and/or fluffing machines are composed essentially
of one or more drums rotating with predetermined direction and
speed, along their circumference there being housed a certain
number of teaseling and/or fluffing rollers see for example EP-A-470571, upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based. If the rollers are
teaseling rollers they are embraced by cloth carrying the needles
alternately in the same direction as the fabric (with the pile)
and in the opposite direction (against the pile), they rotating
about themselves under independent control. The same applies to
fluffing rollers, which carry an abrasive paper covering instead
of cloth carrying needles. These rollers also rotate with
predeterminable speed and direction.It should be noted that during its operation the machine produces
a considerable quantity of down, filaments and dust which partly
deposit between the needles of teaseling machines or on the
abrasive paper of fluffing machines, and partly escape into the
environment, especially the dust.Although no collection system is provided in the machine for the 
dust which escapes into the environment, there is generally an
arrangement consisting of a pair of sector brushes for cleaning
the teaseling and/or fluffing elements.Depending on their type, the sectors are used either for the with-pile
rollers or for the against-pile rollers, and operate in phase
with the drum during the short passage of the relative teaseling
and/or fluffing rollers through the relative brush region.The filaments or fibres removed from the brushes are then
collected via a suction mouth positioned below the brushes, see for example FR-A-341440.Apart from the need to solve the environmental problem by
providing the machine with collection systems suitable for the
particular case, it is also necessary to provide the machine with
a more efficient brushing system.It should also be noted that teaseling and/or fluffing machines
are virtually identical in terms of their layout. They have the
drum at the top, the brushes at the bottom and the suction mouth
below the brushes.The reason for this layout is to enable the fibres and filaments
to fall downwards by gravity in order to improve cleaning.However it has proved not to be so in reality because the air
movement deriving from the rotation of the drum and the teaseling
and/or fluffing rollers and the movement of the fabric means that
the brushing

<CLAIMS>
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and
knitwork comprising essentially a load-bearing structure

consisting of two sidepieces (10) supporting at least one drum
(11) which rotates about a central shaft (12) and supports on its

two lateral endpieces (11a, 11b) two series of teaseling and/or
fluffing rollers of with-pile type (13) and against-pile type

(14), these being arranged along the generators of said drum (11)
with those of one series rotating relative to those of the other

under independent drive, a fabric (15) to be treated passing about
said teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13, 14) and being fed to

the machine by a driven feed roller (16) and extracted therefrom
by a driven exit roller (17), there also being provided brushes

(19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) which interact alternately with said
teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13, 14), characterised in that

a suction unit associated with apertures (37) provided in a
sidepiece (10) of said load-bearing structure creates a suction

within said drum (11) to collect the fibres and dust generated
during operation.
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said apertures are respectively first

apertures (37) in lateral endpieces (11a, 11b) of said drum (11)
and second apertures (39) in said sidepieces (10) and are

connected together by an annular wall (38).
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 2,
characterised in that said annular wall (38) extends into a

flanged portion (40). 
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said brushes, divided into two groups, each

comprise a first rotating brush (19a, 19b) directly interacting
alternately with said teaseling and/or fluffing roller of with-pile

type (13) or against-pile type (14), and a second rotating
brush (20a, 20b) interacting directly and continuously with said

relative first rotating brush (19a, 19b), the interaction between
said first and second brushes of said two groups being continuous

whereas the interaction of said brushes (19a, 19b) with said
teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13, 14) being selectively

intermittent and predetermined on the basis of the type of roller.
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that said first rotating brushes (19a, 19b) and

said second rotating brushes (20a, 20b), divided into two groups,
are pivoted on opposing sides of a plate (21) which is pivoted

centrally (at 22) and made to swivel by an actuator (23) connected
to it and swivel-mounted on a sidepiece (10) of said load-bearing

structure.
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said feed roller (16), said exit roller (17)

and said brushes (19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) are positioned at a vertical (18)
wall of said machine.
