<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a granular charging
agent used in electrically charging a material and a
method of electrically charging a material using the
same, and more particularly, a method of uniformly
charging an electrophotographic photoconductor for use in
a variety of image forming apparatus such as a printer
and a copying machine using the above-mentioned granular
charging agent.Since the invention of an electrophotographic
process by C. F. Carlson as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
2,297,691, various improvements and developments have
been made based on the aforementioned Carlson process.
According to the electrophotographic image formation
method based on the Carlson process, which is now widely
employed, image formation is basically carried out in
such a manner that the surface of a photoconductor is
uniformly charged to a predetermined polarity and the 
photoconductor thus charged is selectively exposed to the
original light images to form electrostatic latent images
on the photoconductor. Then, the electrostatic latent
images are developed with a developer, so that visible
toner images can be obtained on the photoconductor. The
visible toner images are then transferred to a sheet of
an image-receiving member and fixed thereon.To uniformly charge the surface of the photoconductor,
two kinds of charging methods are conventionally
employed. One is a non-contact charging method,
such as corona charging; and the other is a contact
charging method, such as roller charging, brush charging,
charging by use of particles (hereinafter referred to as
the particle charging) and triboelectric charging.In particular, the corona charging is most widely
used as the method of electrically charging the photoconductor.
However, the corona charging has the
drawbacks that the charging level becomes unstable over
an extended period of time, ozone generated in the
charging process is bad for the health of human body, and
a product generated in the charging process is deposited
on the surface of the photoconductor.Of various kinds of contact charging methods, on the
other hand, the roller charging method is put to
practical use. Although ozone is not generated during 
the charging process by the roller charging, the roller
charging has the problems that there is a rick of the
photoconductor being broken by abnormal discharge, it is
difficult to uniformly charge the photoconductor, and the
environmental stability is poor.The brush charging is carried out using a flat brush
with electroconductive fine fibers which
