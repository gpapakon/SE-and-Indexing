<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals, 
such as cows, provided with a milkbox (16) having a milking 

robot and an area (2, 4, 5; 9, 10) where the animals are 
allowed to move freely. The construction comprises one or 

more doors, gates or similar devices (A, B) which open unidirectionally 
to determine the path and direction of travel 

of the animals through the construction and through the 
milkbox (6). The construction may comprise a cowshed (3) and 

a pasture (1) or a pasture (1) only; in case of the latter, 
the milkbox (6) will be placed in the pasture (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a
milkbox and an area where the animals are allowed to move
freely, the construction further being provided with one or
more doors, gates or similar devices forming a one-way
passageway. Consequently, the construction may comprise a
cowshed and/or a pasture or a pasture only. In the latter
case the milkbox might be transportable in the field. A
construction as described in the opening paragraph is known
from GB-A-1,158,016. In the construction described in this
document there are doors, gates or similar devices forming a
one-way passageway between an area where the animals are
allowed to move freely and a milking parlour in the form of a
so-called 'herring-bone milking parlour'. In a construction
for automatic milking, the cows should visit the milkbox of
their own from time to time. In order to improve the visits
of the cows at the milkbox, the construction in accordance
with the invention is characterized in that the milkbox is
provided with a milking robot, the area is divided in at
least two sub-areas and the doors, gates or similar devices
are arranged between said at least two sub-areas to allow the
animals to walk around through said at least two sub-areas to
and from the milkbox and at least one of said doors, gates or
similar devices being provided with a feeding device for
feeding animals.When a number of sub-areas is formed by pastures, 
fences with a one-way passageway are provided between the
pastures. Herewith a rotational grazing system may be
obtained, having the advantage that the animals can change
from one pasture to another and, consequently, can always
take in fresh grass, which improves the milk yield. By the
feeding device the animals are stimulated to pass through the
passageways and to proceed to following pastures.To enable the animals to walk also at night easily
through the successive pastures in one direction, the animals
should be able to find the passageway from one pasture to a
next one without any difficulty. Accordingly, the construction
may be provided with one or more by lamps illuminated
passageways.Furthermore, the farm buildings may be arranged
about centrally in the construction, with the construction
being provided with fences having one-way 
passageways. Such an arrangement facilitates the construction
of a rotational grazing system; the pastures included in the
one-way walk-through system can now always be grouped around
the farm buildings where the
