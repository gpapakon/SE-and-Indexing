<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a device for carrying out a method for securing layers of palletised products. A frame (1) consists of two pairs of mutually parallel rods (2, 3; 4, 5). The rods (2, 3) of the first pair of rods are provided at each of their ends with a guide (6), in which respective end portions of the rods (4, 5) of the second pair of rods are received slideably. Drive means act on the rods (2, 3 and 4, 5) in such a way that they are closed on to a lower web by four surfaces of the layer (8). A carriage (11) is slideably received in two mutually parallel guides (9 and 10), spaced relative to the rods (4, 5) and to the free side surfaces of the layer (8), in such a way that the carriage (11) can be displaced above the upper surface of the layer (8). Suitable drive means are provided for adjusting the carriage (11) at least between end positions located outside the horizontal contour of the layer (8). The carriage (11) carries a sleeve (13) which is moved by means of a drive between end positions fixed by the guides (9, 10), with the stretchable band (18) being unwound from the roll, the end of the band (18) which emerges from the sleeve (13) being retained on one of the side surfaces of the layer (8). By means of a knotting device having a vertically displaceable slide (21) which receives a hook (25) displaceble relative to the latter, a simple overlapping of the ends of the band takes place. Cutting means cut off the end portion of the band.

A method of securing palletized products in place, 
comprising the following base steps: 


palletizing objects by formation of a layer of objects 
on a supporting plane or an underlying object layer; 
perimetrically winding a tape around the object layer; 
fixing the tape;
 
characterized in that it further comprises the following 

steps: 
positioning the objects by formation of a steady layer 
and holding said layer and position by means of a frame 

(1) made of movable sides (2, 3; 4, 5); 
unrolling an extensible tape (18) from a roll by means 

of a sleeve (13) passed through by the tape (18), 
holding the tape (18) end (19) emerging from the sleeve 
(13) on one of the side surfaces of the layer (8); 
winding the tape (18) about the side surfaces of the 
layer (8) by means of the sleeve (13); 
deflecting the tape (18) from one of the side surfaces 
of the layer (8) by means of a vertically-movable small 

block (21); 
lowering the deflected portion by means of the movable 
small block (21); 
further winding the tape (18) until it is brought by an 
end portion (25) thereof onto the deflected and lowered 

portion (25) of the tape (18); 
hooking the end portion (25) by means of a hook (22)  
 

relative to the small block (21); 
lowering the small block (21) by insertion into the loop 
formed by the deflected portion; 
lowering the small block (21) thereby releasing the 
deflected portion which will return to its starting 

position and will be overlapped with the end portion; 
cutting the end portion projecting from the tape (18), 
and 
releasing the end portion from the hook (22). 
A device for carrying into effect the method of claim 
1, characterized in that it consists of: 


a frame (1) made up of a first pair of bars (2 and 3) 
parallel to each other and a second pair of bars (4 and 5) 

parallel to each other, the bars (2, 3) of the first pair 
being respectively provided at their ends with a slide 

within which end Portions of the bars (4, 5) forming the 
second pair are respectively slidably received, 
actuator means acting on the bars (2, 3 and 4, 5) so 
that a layer of objects (8) is held on a lower enclosure 

by four faces, 
two slides (9 and 10) parallel to each other, disposed 
spaced apart from the bars (4, 5) and from the free side 

faces of the layer (8), a carriage (11) being slidably 
received in slides (9, 10) so that said carriage can be 

moved over the upper face of layer (8), suitable actuator 
means being provided to move the carriage (11) at least 

between two limit positions that are located outside the 
horizontal contour of layer (8), carriage (11) bearing a  

 
sleeve (13) that is moved by an actuator between limit 

positions determined by the slides (9, 10) by unrolling of 
the extensible tape (18) from the roll, and the tape (18) 

end emerging from the sleeve (13) being held fast on one 
of the side faces of layer (8), 
a small block (21) vertically movable and receiving a 
hook (25) capable of being displaced relative to said 

small block, and 
cutting means adapted to cut the tape end portion. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the actuator means consists of hydraulic cylinders. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the carriage is made up of a crosspiece (11) slidably 

received by its ends in the slides (9, 10) and slidably 
carrying the sleeve (13) along its longitudinal axis. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the small block is made of a semicircular element (21) 

having a knurled surface facing outwardly relative to the 
corresponding face of layer (8). 
A device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the device uses a low-density 

polyethylene tape.
