<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of controlling the relative flow speed of the layers in a multi-layer headbox with laminae mounted torque-free between upper and lower lips which are stationary when in operation. The invention is characterized in that a difference in speed is produced between the individual layers by causing the static pressure to change differently in the different layers.

Method of setting a relative speed of flow of the layers of a multi-layer
headbox, with lamellae (2.1, 2.2) suspended in moment-free

manner between upper and lower lips (1.1, 1.2), which are immovable
in operation, chara
cterized in that a speed difference of the individual
layers is produced in that a non-uniform course of the

static pressure is produce in relation to the individual layers.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that at least
one layer is produced with a higher flow speed relative to at least

one other layer, in that the static pressure of the flow is initially reduced
in the course of the flow and is at least not increased in the

further course.
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in
that for at least one layer a lower speed of flow is produced relative

to at least one other layer, in that the static pressure of the flow is
initially increased in the course of the flow and is at least not reduced

in the further course.
Multi-layer headbox for carrying the method of claim 1, with the
following features:


4.1 the headbox has an outlet nozzle for material flows with a rigid and
in operation immovable upper lip and louver lip (1.1, 1.2);
4.2 the upper and lower lips (1.1, 1.2) are connected to one another at
the sides via side parts; 
4.3 lamellae (2.1, 2.2) which are rigid per se are located between the
upper and lower lips (1.1, 1.2) and are pivotally connected to a joint

and extend transverse to the flow direction in the direction of the
machine width;
4.4 the lamellae (2.1, 2.2) are movable free of moments in the joint (4.1,
4.2);
4.5 the slot width between the lamellae (2.1, 2.2) or between the lamellae
(2.1, 2.2) and the upper or lower lips (1.1, 1.2) is determined by

the surface shaping of the lamellae or the shaping of the nozzle wall
and the changes of the static pressure relationships associated

therewith,

characterized in that the surface shaping of the lamellae (2.1, 2.2) or
the shaping of the nozzle wall was selected such that a non-uniform

course of the static pressure is produced in relation to the individual
layers, whereby a speed difference of the individual layers is produced.
Multi-layer headbox for carrying out the method of claim 1 in accordance
with claim 4, characterized in that


5.1 N material flows with N 
>
 = 2 are provided, with the outlet nozzle including
N - 1 lamellae which extend over the width of the machine;
5.2 the lamellae are provided as a boundary between the individual
material flows, with at least one of the lamellae being designed at at

least one side with respect to its contour seen in the flow direction
such that it has a convex shape in conjunction with a thickened

portion for the relative speed increase of a layer.
Multi-layer headbox for carrying out the method of claim 1 in accordance
with claim 4, characterized in that


6.1 N material flows are provided with N 
>
= 2, with the outlet nozzle including
N - 1 lamellae which extend over the width of the machine;
6.2 the lamellae are provided as a boundary between the individual
material flows, with at least one of the lamellae being shaped on at

least one side with respect to its contour seen in the flow direction
such that it has a concave shape in connection with a thickness reduction

for a relative speed reduction of the flow.
Multi-layer headbox in accordance with claim 6, characterized by
the following feature:

7.1 at least one of the lamellae is shaped at at least one side, with respect
to its contour seen in the flow direction, such that it has a

convex shape in connection with the thickened portion for the relative
speed increase of a layer.
Multi-layer headbox in accordance with one of the claims 4 to 7,
characterized in that an adjustable screen is provided at the upper

lip.
