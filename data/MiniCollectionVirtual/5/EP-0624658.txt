<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steel wire which has good
workability and is worked by cold-drawing to produce high
strength steel wire products, particularly high strength and
ductile work-hardened type steel wire, and a method of producing
such steel wire.The maximum strength of so-called cold-drawn work-hardened
steel wire which is produced by means of cold-drawing
down to a final diameter of about 0.2 mm is usually about 320
kgf/mm2 (1 kg/mm2 ≃ 9.807 MPa).In the process of producing such steel wire, the final
cold-drawing is performed with the reduction ratio ( ℓ n ε ) at
nearly 3.2. When, for example, a cold-drawn steel wire of
about 0.2mm diameter is produced from a steel wire rod of 5.5mm
diameter, several repetitions of LP(lead patenting) heat
treatment and cold-drawing are required in order to achieve a
specific strength.FIG. 5 shows a typical conventional process flow diagram
for production of the cold-drawn steel wire product. According 
to this process, the 1.2mm ⊘ steel wire of about 125kgf/mm2
tensile strength is made from a 5.5mm ⊘ steel wire rod by
repetitions of drawing and intermediate LP (dipping the
material in a lead bath at about 600 °C after heating it at
above 900°C). The steel wire is further drawn at the drawing
ratio mentioned above to produce the final steel wire product
which has a 0.2 mm diameter and about 320kgf/mm2 tensile
strength.In this process at these conditions, however, further
increase of the drawing reduction ratio in order to raise the
tensile strength to above 320kgf/mm2 is impossible due to loss
of ductility of the material.FIG. 6 shows an example of the relation between the
drawing reduction ℓ n ( A0/An ), and the consequent tensile
strength and RA (reduction in area), where A0 stands for the
cross sectional area of the steel wire before drawing, An for
that after n times (n passes) drawing, and ε is A0/An .As is shown in figure 6, the strength of the drawn wire
product gradually increases as the process of drawing proceeds.When a conventional steel wire of eutectoid composition with
1-2 mm diameter is cold-drawn and combined with LP treatment,
the strength arrives at the maximum value of about 320kgf/mm2
at ℓ n ε =3.2, as mentioned above.We inventors have disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No.3-240919 a method of producing a steel wire for 
making the cold-drawn wire product, wherein the steel wire rod
with 0.7-0.9% carbon is heated to austenite temperature above Ac
3 point, then cooled to a temperature range below Ae1 point and
above 500 °C at the cooling
