<ABSTRACT>
A combustion device (1) incorporated in an apparatus for combustion and/or decomposition of pollutants in air or other gases. The device has a stationary bed of e.g. sand having heat-accumulating and heat-exchanging properties. The bed is provided with heating means to heat a central part of the bed to the self-decomposition and/or the self-combustion temperature of the medium to be treated. The stationary bed (2) is placed on an essentially horizontal support (3), and at the remaining sides it is enclosed by side elements (4, 5) and a roof element (6), the latter resting directly on the upper face of the bed (2) so that the bed supports the roof element (6) and the loads to which the latter is exposed. Inside the bed upper, essentially horizontal tubes (7) are arranged as well as lower, essentially horizontal tubes (8), all said tubes being provided with valve systems at their ends. In this manner a stream of air or gas may be directed from one (8) of the perforated tubes, through the bed (2) and into the other (7) perforated tube in accordance with a first mode of operation. Combustion or decomposition of the pollutants is effected inside the bed. In accordance with a second mode of operation, the direction of flow through the bed may be reversed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a combustion device 
incorporated in an apparatus for combustion and/or 
decomposition of pollutants in gaseous form, in the form 
of droplets or other particles that are carried by the air 
or other gases. The combustion device has a stationary bed 
of sand, rock or other materials having heat-accumulating 
and heat-exchanging properties, and means for heating a 
central part of said bed to the self-decomposition and/or 
the self-combustion temperature of the medium to be 
treated. The combustion device is of the type known as 
regenerative and is arranged to receive flows of said 
pollutants alternately from different directions. In order to decompose pollutants through combustion 
in a device known as a combustion exchanger (see US-A-4,741,690), 
a structure having one upper and one lower air 
distributing duct is often used. The polluted air passes 
through the layer of bed material positioned between said 
ducts, and the bed material often consists of sand which 
has been pre-heated to an elevated temperature of about 
1000Â°C. The capacity expressed as quantity of air flow per 
time unit is determined by the parameters pressure drop 
and temperature of the bed. The pressure drop is a 
function of the thickness of the bed, the composition of 
the material of the bed, the surface structure, the 
granular size and the compaction degree of the material of 
the bed, and so on. To obtain a satisfactory degree of 
purification, expressed as the proportion of pollutants 
remaining in the exhaust in relation to the amount of 
pollutants in the incoming gas, a certain dwelling time in 
the hot zone is required. Each bed layer therefore 
provides a specific degree of purification for a given  
 
flow capacity, depending on the composition and thickness 
of the bed material. When the velocity of the air passing 
through the bed is high, the pressure drop becomes considerable. 
The area of the bed in a combustion exchanger 
therefore determines the dimensions of the total flow. Because of the restrictions laid down by the road 
traffic rules and regulations concerning transports, units 
manufactured in one place for installation elsewhere, 
must not exceed certain limits as to their area and as a 
result they have a restricted flow capacity. If the combustion exchanging technology is to be used 
to treat flows larger than those for which the largest 
units allowable on public roads are intended, larger 
units, built in situ, may be used as an alternative to 
pre-fabricated units.

<CLAIMS>
A combustion device (1) incorporated in an 
apparatus for combustion and/or decomposition of 

pollutants in the form of gas, droplets or other particles 
that are carried by the air or other gases, said combustion 

device (1) having a stationary bed (2) of sand, 
rock or other material having heat-accumulating and heat-exchanging 

properties, and means for heating a central 
part of said bed to the self-decomposition and/or the 

self-combustion temperature of the medium to be treated, 
for instance by means of an electric heater positioned 

inside the bed or by means of gas or oil, said combustion 
device being of the type known as regenerative and being 

arranged to receive flows of said pollutants alternately 
from different directions, 
characterized
 in 
that the stationary bed (2) is positioned on an essentially 

horizontal support (3) and is enclosed on the other 
sides by side elements (4, 5), end elements (25, 26) and a 

roof element (6), the latter resting in direct contact 
with the upper face of the bed (2) in such a manner that 

the bed supports the roof element (6) as well as the loads 
to which the latter is exposed, in that the combustion 

device comprises at least one section (28), each section 
(28) in the bed housing having at least one upper, essentially 

horizontal, perforated tube (7) and at least one lower, 
essentialy horizontal, perforated tube (8), the 

arrangement being such that via an upper inlet connection 
(9) the upper tube communicates with an inlet (10) and via 

an upper outlet connection (11) it communicates with an 
outlet (12), and that via a lower inlet connection (13) 

the lower tube (8) communicates with the inlet (10) and 
via a lower outlet connection (14) it communicates with 

the outlet (12), and such that with the aid of a system of 
valves (15, 16, 17, 18) it becomes possible to close or 

open the corresponding connection (9, 11, 13, 14) between 
the inlet (10) and the corresponding tube (7, 8) and  

 
between the outlet (12) and the corresponding tube (7, 

8), respectively, so that in accordance with a first mode 
of operation of the combustion device (1) the polluted gas 

(19), propelled by its pressure or by a drive means, such 
as a fan, is admitted through the inlet (10) and via the 

lower inlet connection (13) enters into the lower tube (8) 
and through the perforation therein flows up into the bed 

(2), wherein pollutants are combusted or decomposed, and 
from which bed said gas continues into the upper tube (7), 

whereby purified gas (20) from the tube (7) will enter 
into the outlet (12) via the upper outlet connection (11), 

and in accordance with a second mode of operation of the 
combustion device (1) the polluted gas (19) flows from the 

inlet (10) via the upper inlet connection (9) into the 
upper tube (7) and through the perforations therein into

tube (8) will enter into the outlet (12) via the lower 

outlet connection (14).
