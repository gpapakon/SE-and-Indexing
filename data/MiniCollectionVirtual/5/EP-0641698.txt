<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle brake system. The system is of the type comprising an ABS system controlled by main electronics (3). It is characterised in that it comprises means (12) for detecting failure in the main controls (3) and back-up electronic controls (4) independent of the main controls (3) and provided with means (17) for decreasing the braking of the rear wheels (6) when failure in the main controls is detected. The invention can be used for motor vehicles.

Braking equipment for an automotive vehicle, of the 
type comprising a system (2) for the anti-blocking of the 

wheels controlled by a main electronic control (3) and 
means (12) for detecting a failure of the main control 

(3), characterized in that it further comprises an 
electronic emergency control (4) independent of the main 

control (3) and provided with means (17) to decrease the 
braking of the rear wheels (6) when a failure of the main 

control is sensed. 
Braking equipment according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means (12) for detecting a failure of the 

main control (3) are arranged to discontinue the action 
of the latter following the sensing of such a failure. 
Braking equipment according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
in which the main control (3) comprises a computer (8) 

with which are associated an input interface (10) 
intended to receive external information and an output 

interface (11) for the control of electro-valves, a 
storage (9) and an electric energy feeding device (13), 

characterized in that the main control (3) further 
comprises the aforesaid failure detector (12). 
Braking equipment according to one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the emergency control (4) 

comprises an electric energy feeding source which is 
independent of that (13) of the main control (3). 
Braking equipment according to one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the means (17) for 

decreasing the braking of the rear wheels (6) are 
arranged to remove the braking from the rear wheels in 

case of failure of the main control (3).  
 
Braking equipment according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the means (17) for decreasing the 

braking of the rear wheels are arranged to reduce the 
braking of these wheels in case of failure of the main 

control (3). 
Braking equipment according to one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that a circuit for the braking 

of one rear wheel comprises an intake electro-valve (21), 
an exhaust electro-valve (22) and a rear brake caliper 

(23) mounted between these two electro-valves. 
Braking equipment according to claims 5 and 7, 
characterized in that the removal of the rear braking is 

made by a putting of the intake electro-valve (21) in the 
closed position and by putting the exhaust electro-valve 

(22) in the open position. 
Braking equipment according to claims 6 and 7, 
characterized in that the means for decreasing the 

braking through reducing are adapted to ensure a rear 
braking pressure (PF) by simultaneous opening and closing 

of the intake and exhaust electro-valves, respectively, 
and then by opening of the exhaust electro-valve (22) 

while keeping the intake electro-valve in the closed 
state. 
Braking equipment according to one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the emergency control (4) 

is adapted to ensure the control of the rear electro-valves 
(6) upon the simultaneous receiving of a breakdown 

information of the main control (3) and of an information 
on the actuation of the brake pedal.  

 
Braking equipment according to claim 10, 
characterized in that the source of the signal of 

actuation of the brake pedal is a sensor connected to the 
pedal or to the "stop" lights, a pressure sensor in the 

front brakes circuit or an accelerometer. 
Braking equipment according to one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the secondary emergency 

control (4) comprises means for checking the good 
operation of the front electro-valves (5). 
Braking equipment according to claim 12, 
characterized in that th
e checking is a checking of the 
current flowing through the front electro-valves (5) or a 

checking by an information given by the main control (3).
