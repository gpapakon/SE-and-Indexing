<DESCRIPTION>
Polyimides and similar polymers have long been used in a variety
of applications in which high temperatures are encountered. Accordingly, shaped
articles of polyimide have been used as bushings, seals, electrical insulators,
compressor vanes, piston rings, gears, thread guides, brake linings, and clutch
facings. In view of the high cost of polyimide materials, and for greater
flexibility in performance characteristics, it is often desirable to combine
polyimide with other materials such as metal. In this context, a continuing need
exists for economical and efficient methods of combining polyimide with metals.The present invention provides articles comprising non-melt
processable high temperature polymers and metal which can be easily and
economically fabricated.Specifically, the instant invention provides an article comprising:
(A) a shaped insert of non-melt processable polymer having a
cross sectional thickness of at least about 1 mm; and(B) cast metal containing the insert.The invention further provides a process for the preparation of
non-melt processable polymer articles comprising:
(A) forming a shaped insert of non-melt processable polymer
having a thickness of at least about 1 mm; and(B) casting molten metal around the insert to contain the insert,
the metal having a melting point of at least about 400°C, the insert and the cast
metal having an interlocking configuration.The figures are cross sectional illustrations of cast metal-polymeric
articles according to the present invention. Non-melt processable polymers which can be used in the present
invention include those that have no melting point below their decomposition
temperature or a melting point greater than about 370°C. Such polymers include,
for example, polyimides and polybenzimidazoles.A wide variety of polyimides can be used in the present invention,
including those described in Edwards, U.S. Patent 3,179,614, hereby
incorporated by reference. The polyimides described therein are prepared from at
least one diamine and at least one anhydride. Preferred diamines which can be
used include m-phenylene diamine (MPD), p-phenylene diamine (PPD),
oxydianiline (ODA), methylene dianiline (MDA) and toluene diamine (TDA).
Preferred anhydrides which can be used include benzophenone tetracarboxylic
dianhydride (BTDA), biphenyl dianhydride (BPDA), trimellitic anhydride
(TMA), pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), maleic anhydride (MA) and nadic
anhydride (NA).Preferred polyimides which can be used in the present invention
include those prepared from the
