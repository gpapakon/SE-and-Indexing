<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ballpoint pens. More
specifically, the present invention is directed to a so-called
pipe type ballpoint pen having a ballpoint pen tip at the front
end thereof, the ballpoint pen tip rotatably accommodating a
ball at the front end of a pipe made of metal. The invention
is particularly related to a pipe type ballpoint pen adapted
for writing thin characters.A well known conventional ballpoint pen is so designed
that a ballpoint pen tip which rotatably accommodates a ball at
the front end of a pipe made of metal is force fitted into a
holder made of a synthetic resin. (For example, U.S.P. No.
4311403).However, the ballpoint pen is usually used while
inclined with respect to a writing surface. Therefore, a
bending moment is applied to the front pipe portion at all
times. When a large writing pressure (more specifically, a
vertical load of about 1.0 kg or more with respect to the
writing surface at a writing angle of 60 to 75°) is applied to
the ballpoint pen tip in the conventional ballpoint pen, the
writing pressure, of course, varying from one user to another,
the front pipe portion is bent at the joint thereof.
Particularly, in a pipe type ballpoint pen having a ball 
receiving seat formed by utilizing deformation of a metallic
material by pressing, it is not practical to improve bending
strength by increasing the thickness of the front pipe portion
since it is difficult to manufacture a ballpoint pen having too
large a thickness of the front pipe portion.Further, the conventional ballpoint pen is usually such
that the outer diameter of the front pipe portion and the outer
diameter of the ball accommodated at the front end thereof are
large (more specifically, the outer diameter of the front pipe
portion is set to 0.8 mm or more and the outer diameter of the
ball at the front end is set to 0.5 mm or more), which produces
thick handwritten characters, thus not making the ballpoint pen
suitable for jotting down thin characters into small spaces in
a pocketbook or the like. If the outer diameter of the front
pipe portion and that of the ball at the front end are reduced
in order to obtain a ballpoint pen suitable for producing thin
handwritten characters, chances of the front pipe portion being
bent with a slightest writing pressure increase.If the front pipe portion has a thin wall thickness by
having a ball receiving seat formed by inward deformation
thereof (more specifically, the thickness of the front pipe
portion is set to 0.15 mm or less), or the front pipe portion
