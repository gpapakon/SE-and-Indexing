<ABSTRACT>
A telephone (100) includes means for switching the LEDs (104), on the face of the phone, between a normal operating mode in which the lights indicate the status of telephony features, such as mute or hold, to a diagnostic operating mode in which the LEDs indicate the status of the telephone's data communications signals. The modes are toggled by entry of a code on the telephone keypad (114) or by way of a command from a workstation coupled to the telephone by way of a data communications port (116).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DATA DIAGNOSTICS WITH LEDS ON THE FACE OF A TELEPHONEI. Background of the InventionA. Field of the Invention This invention relates to telephone equipment and related diagnostic features.B. Related ArtConventional digital telephones will sometimes include one or more data communications ports. Such data communications ports will typically include signal lines for transmitted data, received data and one or more control signals such as data terminal ready (DTR) . In some of these telephones, such as the ROLMphone 244PC, the status of data communications signals is displayed by dedicated light emitting diodes (LEDs) located on the back of the telephone, in proximity to the physical data communications connector.An example of such a telephone is illustrated in FIG 1. The telephone 100 of FIG. 1 includes a plurality of keys 102A-J. For each of the keys 102 A-J there is a corresponding adjacently located LED 104 A-J. The telephone of FIG. 1 is also provided with volume control keys 106, 108 (which have no corresponding LEDs) , a handset 110, a liquid crystal display 112, and a telephone keypad 114. A RS-232 data communications port 116 and a telephone network port 118 (for connection to a branch exchange system) are provided at the rear of the telephone.A rear view of the telephone of FIG. 1 is illustrated in FIG. 2. As will be observed from FIG. 2, the telephone includes a power input connector 202, and a row of LEDs 204 which indicate whether the telephone has adequate power and the status of a subset of the data communications lines on 

the data communications port 116. For example, the LEDs 204 may indicate, from left to right, the status of DTR, transmitted data (Tx) , received data (Rx) and the power supply. A problem with having the diagnostic LEDs at the rear of the telephone is that they can be awkward to use. For example, movement of the telephone to view the diagnostic LEDs can cause entanglement or disconnection of data communications, telephony and power cables attached to the telephone at the rear. The action of moving the phone can also cause the cables to interfere with other items on the desk on which the telephone sits. Further, the fact that the LEDs are dedicated to diagnostics, but only occasionally viewed by the user, results in unnecessary cost in parts and manufacturing.II. Summary of the InventionIn light of the above, there is provided a telephone, including: a telephone face having keypad and a plurality of indicators; telephony line interface means for connecting the telephone to

Claims :
1. A telephone, comprising: a telephone face having a keypad and a plurality of indicators; telephony line interface means for connecting the telephone to a telephony , 5 line; a data communications port; and, control means, coupled to the keypad and the indicators, for causing the telephone to be placed in any of a normal mode, in which the status of signals on the telephony line is indicated by at least some of the indicators, and a diagnostic mode, in 10 which the status of signals on the data communications port is indicated by at least some of the indicators, the control means being operable in response to a command from a user.
15 2. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein the control means comprises detection means for detecting reception of a first sequence of characters by the data communications port; and, switch means, coupled to the detection means, causing the telephone to change between the normal mode and
20 the diagnostic mode in response to reception of the first sequence of characters.
3. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein the control means comprises means for detecting depression of a first 25 sequence of keys on the keypad and switch means, coupled to the detection means, causing the telephone to change between the normal mode and the diagnostic mode in response to depression of the first sequence of keys.
30 4. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein the control means comprises detection means for detecting reception of a predetermined indication from any of the keypad and the data communications port; and, switch means, coupled to the detection means, causing the telephone to change between
35 the normal mode and the diagnostic mode in response to detection of the predetermined indication. 


 5. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein the second mode comprises a plurality of selectable submodes in which the status of different sets of signals on the data communications port are indicated.
6. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein the telephone comprises a plurality of data communications ports and wherein the second mode comprises a plurality of selectable submodes in which the status of signals on each of the data communications ports are separately indicated.
7. The telephone of Claim 1 further comprising mode indication means, coupled to at least one of the indicators, for causing the at least one of the indicators to be continuously activated when the telephone is in the diagnostic mode.
8. The telephone of Claim 1 further comprising: means for storing indicator control commands arriving on the telephony line while the telephone is in the diagnostic mode and for operating the indicators in accordance with the indicator control commands when the telephone is switched from diagnostic mode to normal mode.
9. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein the indicators are lights.
10. The telephone of Claim 1 wherein data traffic density on the data communications port is indicated by cadence of at least one of the indicators when the telephone is in diagnostic mode.
11. The telephone of Claim 3 wherein the first sequence of keys is a mnemonic indicative of the diagnostic mode. 


 12. A telephone, comprising: a telephone face having a keypad and a plurality of visual indicators; telephony line interface means for connecting the telephone to a telephony line; data communications interface means for connecting the telephone to at least one digital data communications link; and, control means, coupled to the keypad and the indicators, for causing the telephone to be placed in any of a normal mode, in which the status of signals on the telephony line is indicated by at least some of the indicators, and a diagnostic mode, in which the status of signals on the data communications link is shown by at least some of the indicators, the control means being operable in response to a command from the keypad; storage means for storing indicator control commands arriving on the telephony line while the telephone is in the diagnostic mode; wherein when the telephone is switched from diagnostic mode to normal mode, the control means operates the indicators in accordance with the indicator control commands received while the telephone was in diagnostic mode.
