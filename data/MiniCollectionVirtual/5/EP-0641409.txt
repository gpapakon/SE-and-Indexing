<ABSTRACT>
An expansion joint for part of a railway track arranged on a foundation (20) has a stock rail (10) with a stock rail head (14) and a tongue (34) movable with respect to and along said stock rail head (34), upon which at least one fastening means (36) acts for pressing it on the stock rail. This expansion joint enables the rail foot to be longitudinally moved with little friction and excludes tipping of the stock rail or tongue. For that purpose, the tongue (34) can be non-positively pressed on the stock rail (10, 14) by the fastening means (36), and the force thus transmitted is decomposed into components that act on the one hand in the direction of the foundation and on the other hand in the direction of the stock rail head (14).

<CLAIMS>
An expansion joint for part of a railway track disposed on a foundation (214) comprising 
a first fixed rail section (128, 212) and a second rail section (122, 219) movable 

in relation thereto, said second rail section having a curvature is pressed against 
said first rail section over an area (B), and said second rail section having in its tip 

a bending when transverse forces are acting on it during its movement
characterized in that
 
said first fixed rail section (128) has, in said area (B) in which said movable second 

rail section (122) is in contact, a curvature corresponding to the bending line of said 
movable second rail section. 
An expansion joint according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
said first rail section is a tongue (212) and the second rail section is a stock rail 

(210). 
An expansion joint according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
said first rail section is a stock rail (128) and the second rail section is a tongue. 
An expansion joint according to Claim 3,
characterized in that
 
a friction coefficient of µ
B
 with µ
B
 ≤ 0.1 exists between contacting surfaces of the 
stock rail underside and the associated support/sliding surface, and a friction coefficient 

of µ
z
 with µ
z
 ≥ 0.3 between contacting surfaces of said tongue foot underside 
and associated support surface. 
An expension joint according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that
 
the tongue (34) presses against said stock rail (10, 14) in a non-positive connection 

via said fastening means (36, 50, 52), wherein said fastening means is a clamp (36) 
extending from said foundation (20) or from an element (38) disposed thereon, and 

supported in the transitional area (25) of tongue foot and web (40, 42) in order to 
transmit force components in the direction both of said foundation (20) and of said 

stock rail head (14). 
An expansion joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
said fastening means (50, 52) extends from said foundation (20) or from an element 

(38, 54, 86, 92) such as a sliding or support block disposed thereon, and is supported 
by a rolling or sliding element (50) in said transitional area (35) of said tongue foot 

and web (40, 42) in order to transmit force components in the direction both of said 

foundation (20) and of said stock rail head (14), said rolling or sliding element 
preferably extending from a shaft (52) or from an element having a shaft, said shaft 

or said element being movable in relation to said foundation. 
An expansion joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
at least one fastening means (228) acts on said stock rail (210) and effects a non-positive 

connection between said stock rail head (230) and said tongue (212), where 
said fastening means (228) such as rolling or sliding element (232), if necessary 

spring-loaded and extending directly or indirectly from said foundation (214) is 
supported in the transitional area (234) of said stock rail foot (218) and said web 

(236) in order to transmit force components in the directions both of said foundation 
(214) and of said stock rail head (230). 
An expansion joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
said tongue (34) is disposed in longitudinally movable manner on a sliding or support  

 
block (38, 54) from which extends a spring element (48) resting on said stock rail 

foot (16). 
An expansion joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
said tongue (34) is supported in sliding manner on a support (76) preferably consisting 

of plastic and surrounding said stock rail foot (16) in some areas both on the 
foundation side and on the tongue side. 
An expansion joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
said tongue (34) is supported on a sliding/support block (92) that on the one hand 

rests on said stock rail foot (16) and on the other hand presses against a stop (88) on 
the side facing away from said stock rail, and wherein said sliding/support block 

disposed movably in relation to said foundation (20) is passed through by an anchoring 
means (62, 64, 90) such as a bolt connecting said fastening means (36, 50)

said tongue (34) is supported in the tongue tip area, in which the tongue foot underside 

(102) is at a higher level than that in the tongue foot area, on support blocks (108, 
110) that on the one hand follow in some sections the longitudinal movement of said 

tongue and on the other hand are fixable in the area of given points such as foundations 
(114). 
An expansion joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
