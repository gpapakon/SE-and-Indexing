<ABSTRACT>
A memory controller (12) is equipped with a memory data search circuit (35) for carrying out 
an identifying operation of management information corresponding to a segment located in front of or 

behind a segment serving as a reference for an editing operation on a recording medium (1) through 
search and comparison processing of managing information (U-TOC). A system controller (11) does 

not receive search data and execute the data search but only sets the comparison standard and an initial 
value and outputs an execution control signal. The editing operation performed reduces wasted space 

on the recording medium (1), such as a disc, and eliminates "trash areas" which are not addressable in 
the U-TOC

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to editing management information on recording media and is applicable, for
instance, to a recording and reproducing apparatus, for example apparatus capable of recording and
reproducing audio data, such as music, on a disc-type recording medium. This invention is also applicable,
for instance, to a memory data search and/or retrieve circuit which may form a part of such a memory
control device.Data rewritable disc media in which a user can record audio data, such as music, is well known.
Such disc media is provided with a data area and managing area within the recordable area. The audio data
is pre-recorded in the data area. The disc media is so designed that managing data for these areas is
rewritten every time a recording operation or an erasing operation for audio data is terminated. The
managing area is typically referred to as the user TOC (Table of Contents), hereinafter referred to
"U-TOC".An audio recording apparatus is so designed that when an audio recording operation for a musical
piece or song takes place a recordable area on a disc is located on the basis of the U-TOC information.
The audio recording apparatus then records the audio data for the musical piece on this recordable area. On
the other hand, the reproducing apparatus accesses the area in which audio data to be reproduced is
recorded to carry out a reproducing operation for the musical piece identified from the U-TOC area.Generally, for a recordable disc medium such as a magneto-optical (MO) disc or the like, random
access recording can more easily be carried out in comparison with tape-type recording medium such as
DAT (Digital Audio Tape), a compact cassette tape or the like. Also it is not necessary to record a musical
piece (audio data) on a continuous segment, that is, the program (the audio data for the musical piece) is
discontinuously and discretely recorded in plural segments. As used herein, the term "segment" is defined
as a track portion on which physically-continuous data is recorded.Typically, in a system in which data is read out of a magneto-optical disc, such data is temporarily
stored into a buffer memory (buffer RAM) at a high-speed rate, and then the data is read out as an audio
reproducing signal from the buffer RAM at a low-speed rate to perform demodulation processing. Access
between segments enables a reproduced musical piece to be outputted without being interrupted even if the
data read-out operation from the magneto-optical disc is temporarily interrupted.Accordingly, by repeating

<CLAIMS>
A method of editing management information on a disc-type recording medium which manages recorded
and recordable segments to eliminate and to minimize wasted space and comprises part tables (Olh etc)

corresponding to recorded or recordable segments and corresponding tables indicating a header part table,
wherein each part table has a start address, end address, and link information for connecting each part table,

comprising the steps of:

setting (S101; S201) an address of a segment to be erased as a reference address (N ref, AD ref);
scanning addresses of recordable segments in accordance with said link information and
corresponding table indicating data;
comparing said reference address and scanned addresses so as to search for the nearest recordable
segment to said segment to be erased;
storing the address of the nearest recordable segment;
scanning addresses of recorded segments in accordance with said link information and
corresponding table indicating data;
comparing said reference address and scanned addresses so as to search for the nearest recorded
segment to said segment to be erased;
storing the address of the nearest recorded segment;
comparing the address of said nearest recorded segment with the address of said nearest recordable
segment;
merge processing (S112, S113; S212, S213) in accordance with result of said comparison;
editing said management information in accordance with said merge processing; and
recording said management information on the recording medium.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the address of a segment to be erased as a reference
address indicates the start address.
A method according to claim 11, wherein the address of a segment to be erased as a reference
address indicates the end address.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the scanned address indicates the start address.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the scanned address indicates the end address.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the scanned address indicates the start address.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the scanned address indicates the end address.
A method according to claim 1, comprising the steps of:

storing link information indicating a part table corresponding to the nearest recorded segment; and
storing link information indicating a part table corresponding to the nearest recordable segment.
A method according to claim 2, comprising the steps of:

comparing the difference between said reference address and said address of the nearest recorded
segment and a predetermined value in the case where the address of the nearest recorded segment is greater

than the address of the nearest recordable segment; and 
executing merge processing when the difference between the reference address and the address of
said nearest recorded segment is not equal to the predetermined value.
A method according to claim 5, comprising the steps of:

comparing the difference between the reference address and the address of the nearest recorded
segment and a predetermined value in the case where the address of the nearest recorded segment is greater

than the address of the nearest recordable segment; and
rewriting the start address corresponding to the segment to be erased to the value of the
predetermined value added to the nearest recorded segment in the case where the difference between the

reference address and the address of the nearest recorded segment is not equal to said predetermined value.
A method according to claim 8, comprising the steps of:

setting the start address of the part table corresponding to the segment to be erased as the address
of the nearest recordable segment in the case where the address of the nearest recordable segment is greater

than the address of the nearest recorded segment, and;
entering the part table which is indicated by link information for indicating the segment
corresponding to the nearest recordable segment which is an empty slot.
A method according to claim 3, comprising the steps of:

comparing the difference between the reference address and the address of the nearest recorded
segment and a predetermined value in the case where the address of the nearest recordable segment is

greater than the address of the nearest recorded segment; and
executing merge processing in the case where the difference between the reference address and the
address of the nearest recorded segment is not equal to said predetermined value.
A method according to claim 6, comprising the steps of:

comparing the difference between the reference address and the address of the nearest recorded
segment and a predetermined value in the case where the address of the nearest recorded segment is greater

than the address of the nearest recordable segment; and
rewriting the start address corresponding to the segment to be erased with the value of the
predetermined value added to the nearest recorded segment in the case where the difference between the

reference address and the address of the nearest recorded segment is not equal to the predetermined value.
A method according to claim 8, comprising the steps of:

setting the end address of the part table corresponding to the segment to be erased as an end
address which is indicated by stored link information indicating the part table corresponding to the nearest

recordable segment in the case where the address of the nearest recorded segment is greater than the address
of the nearest recordable segment; and
entering in the part table, which is indicated by link information, the segment corresponding to the
nearest recordable segment which is empty.
