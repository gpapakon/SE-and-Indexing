<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a system to re-circulate treatment 
material in processes of surface treatment and finishing, as 
set forth in the main claim. The re-circulation system according to the invention is 
employed advantageously for the re-circulation of corrosive 
and abrasive acid baths or for the re-circulation of molten 
metals. To be more exact, the system to re-circulate treatment 
material according to the invention is applied to pickling 
plants and/or turbulent pickling plants and/or plants for 
pickling and electrolytic processes employed for surface 
treatment of metallic objects such as metallic strip. This system to re-circulate treatment material according 
to the invention is used advantageously also in plants for 
the surface finishing of metallic objects and especially in 
plants in which metallic coatings applied with heat, such as 
galvanising and aluminising, are produced. The state of the art includes the pickling method which 
has the purpose of removing from the surface of the steel 
the non-metallic particles and, in particular, the oxides 
forming on that surface. The pickling is carried out by making the surface of the 
steel cooperate with inorganic acids or salts which attack 
the surface of the steel to be treated in a more or less 
intense manner. Pickling plants for strip, with which the invention is 
concerned, are continuous dip plants and comprise at least 
one dip tank filled with a solution containing the required 
acid or salt in which the strip, or material to be cleaned, 
is immersed and caused to pass at the desired speed.  
 The solution generally leaves the dip tank by gravity and 
is collected in an underlying re-circulation vessel, whence 
it is drawn by re-circulation pump means so as to be re-immitted 
into the dip tank. The aggressive nature of the acid solutions used in the 
step of pickling or acid washing of the metal reduces 
considerably the life of the re-circulation pumps, which 
therefore have to be often replaced. With a view to increasing the life of the pumps there is 
also a tendency to keep the temperature of the solution at 
values lower than those providing maximum efficiency of the 
pickling process. Moreover, the presence of abrasive particles consisting 
mainly of scales of metallic oxides which are detached from 
the metallic surface makes the working conditions of the re-circulation 
pumps still more severe and shortens their life 
even further. This situation makes necessary a frequent operation of 
filtration and/or regeneration of
