<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substituted aminopyrimidines which are useful for the 
treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The compounds of this 
invention are also useful as lipid lowering agents. The compounds of this invention achieve their hemodynamic effects by 
antagonizing the effects of angiotensin II; the active component of the renin angiotensin 
system. Angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I by the action of the enzyme 
renin. Angiotensin II (A II) is formed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) acting 
on angiotensin I. A II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and is implicated as the cause of 
high blood pressure in a number of species including man. A II elicits these 
vasopressor responses by acting at specific receptor sites. The compounds of this 
invention compete with A II for these receptor sites, thus antagonizing the vasopressor 
effects of A II. E. E. Allen et al. disclose N-substituted oxopyrimidines in EP 0419048 A. E. 
E. Allen et al. describe 4-oxo-quinazolines in EP 0411766 A. D. A. Roberts et al. 
describe quinoline ethers in EP 0412848 A. D. J. Carini et al. in U.S. patent 4,880,804 
describe N-substituted benzimidazoles. P. Chakravarty et al. disclose similar imidazole 
structures in EP 0401030 A where the phenyl aromatic ring is replaced by a seven 
membered heterocycle. Azabenzimidazoles are described by P. Herold et al. in EP 
0415886 A. D. J. Carini et al. disclose N-substituted imidazoles in EP 0253310, EP 
0324377, and U.S. patent 4,916,129. D. J. Carini et al. disclose N-substituted 
pyrazoles, pyrroles and triazoles in EP 0323841. Similar pyrazole derivatives are 
disclosed by T. Naka et al. in EP 0411507 A and additional triazoles are described by 
L. L. Chang et al. in EP 0412594 A.. All of the above are claimed as A II antagonists. The compounds of this invention differ from the above mentioned prior art in 
that they contain a substituted 4-aminopyrimidine ring.  
 EP-A-0424317 was published on 24 April 1991. It discloses pyrimidine 
compounds having the formula 
 
and their salts where one of R₁, R₂ and R₃ are aliphatic hydrocarbyl (opt. substd. by
