<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible boat including:
 

   a boat bottom, the boat bottom being fabricated by 
curving a thin, flat plate into a quadric surface such that 

a predetermined keel line, a predetermined chine line, and a 
predetermined stern line are included on or above the flat 

plate; dividing a portion of the flat plate, which portion 
is surrounded by the keel line, the chine line and the stern 

line, by a plurality of straight lines; and connecting a 
plurality of flat plate pieces together such that the flat 

plate pieces are bendable, the flat plate pieces being 
formed in configurations which respectively match divided 

shapes; and
 

   a buoyancy body, the boat bottom being installed at a 
bottom portion of the buoyancy body so as to be attachable 

to and removable from the buoyancy body. 
The collapsible boat has a curved configuration, 
sufficient strength, superior ability to ride over waves, 

and excellent seaworthiness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collapsible boat in 
which a boat bottom is installed at a buoyancy body so as to 
be attachable to and removable from the buoyancy body. Various types of conventional collapsible boats are 
known. A collapsible boat having the structure disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 1-233190 will be 
described hereinafter as an example of such conventional 
collapsible boats. As illustrated in Fig. 19, a collapsible boat 100 is 
formed by a hull outer board 102, a plurality of reinforcing 
frames 104, 106 and the like. An unillustrated bow 
reinforcing frame is mounted to the bow side of the hull 
outer board 102, and a cover 108 is fit to the top end 
surface of the unillustrated bow reinforcing frame so as to 
be attached thereto. Further, a rear portion reinforcing 
frame 104 is mounted to the stern side of the hull outer 
board 102. A front portion reinforcing frame 106 is mounted 
between the bow reinforcing frame and the rear portion 
reinforcing frame 104. Stiffeners 110, 112 for 
reinforcement and buoyancy are adhered to the respective  
 
sides of the hull outer board 102. As illustrated in Fig. 20, the hull outer board 102 is 
divided into a plurality of outer board pieces (FRP boards) 
102A. The outer board pieces 102A are joined by waterproof 
synthetic fiber fabric (not illustrated) . The synthetic 
resin fabric is coated with a synthetic rubber solution, and 
adheres and is made waterproof due to the synthetic rubber 
solution drying. When the collapsible boat 100 disclosed in the above-mentioned 
publication is to be used, after the hull outer 
board 102 is bent into a hull shape as illustrated in Fig. 
19, the rear portion reinforcing frame 104, the front 
portion reinforcing frame 106 and the like are mounted. 
When the collapsible boat 100 is to be transported, as 
illustrated in Fig. 21, after the rear portion reinforcing 
frame 104, the front portion reinforcing frame 106 and the 
like are removed, the hull outer board 102 is folded at the 
seams of the respective hull outer board pieces 102A. However, in the above-described structure, the hull 
outer board 102 is merely structured as a set of a plurality 
of planar boards. Accordingly, the assembled collapsible 
boat 100 is also structured as a set of planes. As a 
result, this structure does not allow for a curved 
configuration which is superior with respect to ability to 
ride over waves and seaworthiness, and does not sufficiently  
 
address the demand for an improvement of these

A collapsible boat (10) characterized by comprising: 
   a boat bottom (14), said boat bottom (14) being 

fabricated by curving a thin, flat plate (34) into a quadric 
surface such that a predetermined keel line (K), a 

predetermined chine line (C1, C2) and a predetermined stern 
line (S1, S2) are included on or above the flat plate (34); 

dividing a portion of the flat plate (34), which portion is 
surrounded by the keel line (K), the chine line (C1, C2) and 

the stern line (S1, S2), by a plurality of straight lines 
(P); and connecting a plurality of flat plate pieces (22A, 

24A) together such that the flat plate pieces (22A, 24A) are 
bendable, the flat plate pieces (22A, 24A) being formed in 

configurations which respectively match divided shapes; and
