<ABSTRACT>
The electric lamp has a quartz glass lamp vessel (1) in the wall (2) of which 
current lead-through conductors (3) are accommodated which comprise a molybdenum 

foil (5) to a first end portion (5') of which a molybdenum outer current conductor (6) is 
connected. A capillary space extends around the outer conductor (6) from an end face 

of a seal (8), in which space the first end portion (5') projects. The outer current 
conductor (6) has a coating of platinum and a skin (9) of platinum phosphide, the first 

end portion (5') has a skin (9') of molybdenum phosphide and the capillary space is 
closed by a borate glass (10). The skins and the borate glass enable to operate the lamp 

in a surrounding of a relatively high temperature without affecting the life of the lamp, 
which would otherwise occur as a result of oxidation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric lamp provided with a quartz glass 
lamp vessel which is closed in a vacuumtight manner and through whose wall current 
supply conductors extend to a electric element arranged in the lamp vessel,
 
   which current supply conductors each have a molybdenum foil and 
connected thereto at a first end portion thereof a outer current conductor made of 
molybdenum which issues from the lamp vessel to the exterior, and at a second end 
portion thereof a inner current conductor,
 
   which molybdenum foil is embedded in a seal of the lamp vessel and lies 
with its first end portion in a capillary space which extends around the outer current 
conductor up to a end face of the seal,
 
   at least the first end portion of the molybdenum foil and the outer current 
conductor having a protective coating against oxidation. Such a electric lamp is known from US 3,798,058. The known lamp has molybdenum foils ad outer current conductors 
which are coated with molybdenum phosphide or with molybdenum phosphate. This 
coating delays oxidation of the foils, but it renders a comparatively low upper limit for 
the seal temperature necessary in order to have a lamp achieve its calculated life. US 3,211,826 discloses an electric lamp in which the capillary space 
around the outer current conductor is closed with borate glass. Borate glass has a 
comparatively low softening temperature of 350-450° C.
 
When the lamp seal is at a comparatively high temperature, at which oxidation of the 
molybdenum foil may shorten lamp life, borate glass is liquid and closes the capillary 
space around the outer current conductor, thus preventing penetration of oxygen to the 
foil. When the lamp cools down after extinguishing, the borate glass solidifies and 
contracts more strongly than the surrounding quartz glass. As a result, cracks develop 
in the borate glass through which oxygen can penetrate. Borate glass offers only a small  
 
delay of the oxidation in the case of lamps which are switched off each time after a 
short period of operation. A major disadvantage of borate glass, such as lead borate glass, is that it 
is hygroscopic and thus does not counteract transport of moisture to the molybdenum 
foil, so oxidation in humid surroundings. Another disadvantage is that borate glass can 
attack molybdenum. US 3,211,826 accordingly expresses a preference for the use of 
platinum outer current conductors. These, however, are expensive. EP 0,245,734 discloses a electric lamp whose capillary space is sealed
