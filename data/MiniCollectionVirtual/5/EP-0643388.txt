<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk for
recording therein video signal and audio signal, and an
optical recording and reproducing apparatus for recording
and reproducing video and audio signals onto and from the
optical disk.Recently, the optical disk is noticed as an information
recording medium of large storage capacity and fast access
speed. Known optical disk recording methods include a
constant linear velocity (CLV) method in which the rotating
speed of a disk is varied in inverse proportion to the track 
radius so that the linear velocity of the track may be
constant anywhere on the disk, a constant angular velocity
(CAV) method in which the disk is rotated at a constant
angular velocity, a modified CLV (MCLV) method, and a modified
CAV (MCAV) method. The MCAV method is a recording
method in which the rotating speed of the disk is kept
constant, the recording area is divided into plural regions
called zones in the radial direction of the disk, and the
clock frequency for recording is varied zone by zone so as
to be higher as going closer to the outer circumference so
that the recording mark length becomes almost the same at
the outer side and at the inner side. In the MCAV method,
since the rotating speed of the disk is constant, the control
of rotation of the spindle motor for rotating the disk
is easy, and the sector position can be specified radially
from the center of the disk, so that it is excellent in
random access performance. Moreover, since the recording
mark length is the same at the inner side and at the outer
side, the recording capacity can be increased, which improves
the defect of shortage of storage capacity in the CAV 
method.In the audio-video field, on the other hand, by making
use of the excellent random access performance, the optical
disk has been applied in an editing machine capable of
easily post-scoring or pre-scoring only audio signal or
video signal, or only a specific channel among plural channels.In the MCAV method, however, since the linear velocity
is faster and the recording frequency is higher at the outer
side as compared with the inner side, the jitter is worsened
at the outer side as compared with the inner side, thereby
resulting in a difference in the recording and reproducing
characteristic.It is hence a primary object of the invention to
present an optical disk, an optical recording method, an
optical recording apparatus, an optical reproducing apparatus,
and an optical recording and reproducing apparatus
capable of recording and reproducing
