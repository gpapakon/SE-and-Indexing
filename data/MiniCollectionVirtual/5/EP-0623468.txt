<ABSTRACT>
In a ductor inking device for printing presses, in particular sheet-fed offset printing presses, an ink application on the printing carrier which develops at a low printing speed is to be prevented from decreasing when the printing speed is increased, in particular to very high speeds. Provision is made for the ink fountain roller (1) to be driven at a constant rotary speed for all printing speeds and for the ductor roller (3) to be engaged increasingly against the ink fountain roller as a function of the printing speed and for the duration of said printing speed.

Process for ink quantity adjustment on ductor inking 
units of printing presses with an ink fountain 

roller (1) rotating independently of the printing 
speed (MG), wherein an ink film on the ink fountain 

roller (1) is transferred by means of a timed 
contact of a ductor roller (3) from the ink fountain 

roller (1) on to a first inking unit roller (4) 
arranged after the ductor roller (3), and the 

contact of the ductor roller (3) is controlled 
according to guidelines, characterised in that the 

ink fountain roller (1) is driven at all printing 
speeds in accordance with a movement law which 

remains the same in time and that the contact angle 
(WV) of the ductor roller (3) against the ink 

fountain roller (1) is controlled corresponding to a 
characteristic curve reproducing the relationship of 

contact angle (WV) and print speed (MG). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the ink fountain roller (1) at all printing speeds 

(MG) is driven with continuous peripheral speed at a 
constant rotational speed or stepwise with a 

constant stepping frequency and speed of rotation 
during the stepping phase. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the rotational speed of the ink fountain roller 

(1) is adjusted corresponding to the ink 
requirements. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the contact angle (WV) of the 

ductor roller (3) against the ink fountain roller 
(1) is changed in accordance with a characteristic 

curve reproducing the dependence on the print speed  
 

(MG) as a linear function. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that after a command effecting a 

change of the print speed (MG), after the ductor 
roller (3) has taken up a predetermined position 

with respect to the ink fountain and the first of 
the ink fountain rollers arranged subsequent to the 

ductor roller (1, 4), first a change of the contact 
angle (WV) of the ductor roller (3) with reference 

to the ink fountain roller (1) is introduced from 
the value corresponding to the then printing speed 

(MG) to the value coordinated to the printing speed 
(MG) provided in accordance with the characteristic 

curve, and that after a determined press angle (MW), 
the intended change of the printing speed (MG) is 

carried out. 
Ductor inking unit for a printing press for applying 
the process according to one of Claims 1 to 5 in 

which an ink fountain roller (1) cooperating with an 
ink fountain (2) can be driven via motor (M) 

independently of the printing speed (MG) and an 
intermittent ductor roller (3) is arranged with a 

ductor roller drive downstream which has a control 
(S) which senses the printing speed, characterised 

in that arranged relative to the control (S) sensing 
the printing speed (MG) for the ductor roller drive 

(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) is a characteristic curve 
store (K) in which the dependence of the contact 

angle (WV) of the ductor roller (3) against the ink 
fountain roller (1) is stored as a function of the 

printing speed (MG) and via the ductor roller drive 
(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), the contact angle (WV) of 

the ductor roller (3) against the ink fountain 
roller (1) is changed in dependence on the printing 

speed (MG) corresponding to this characteristic  
 

curve (K). 
Ductor inking unit according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the ductor roller drive (5, 6, 

7, 8, 9, 10, 11) has two cam discs rotatable 
relative to one another on the outer contour (U, V) 

of which runs a roller (6) coupled to the ductor 
roller (3), and the cam discs (8, 9) can be driven 

from the printing unit by an adjustment drive (10) 
and via an adjusting motor (11) connected via the 

adjustment drive (10) by the control (S) can be 
rotated relatively to one another corresponding to 

the data deposited in the characteristic curve store 
(K). 
Ductor inking unit according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that one of the cam discs (8, 9) 

has in one angular region the peripheral contour (V) 
for contacting the ductor roller (3) against the ink 

fountain roller (1). 
Ductor inking unit according to one of Claims 6 to 
8, characterised in that the ink fountain roller (1) 

can be driven with a constant rotational speed by 
the motor (M) and the drive (A) and/or stepwise with 

a predetermined frequency as well as rotational 
speed during the stepping phase. 
Ductor inking unit according to one of Claims 6 to 
9, characterised in that differing rotational speeds 

can be predetermined for the drive (A) of the motor 
(M) of the ink fountain roller (1).
