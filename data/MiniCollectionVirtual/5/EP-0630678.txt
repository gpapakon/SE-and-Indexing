<ABSTRACT>
A device for the purification of air, applicable in 
particular to cooker hoods, comprises a cylindrical 

casing (11) enclosed at the ends by two covers (12, 13) 
provided uppermost with relative couplings (122, 131) 

for connection respectively to a hood and to a venting 
pipeline equipped with a suitable extractor, also a 

plurality of perforated metal discs (16) installed 
internally of and coaxial with the casing, spaced apart 

one from another and keyed centrally to a shaft (15) 
mounted in appropriate supporting elements (14) and 

coupled to a geared electric motor (2). The lower parts 
of the discs (16) are partially immersed in a suitable 

liquid directed into the casing by way of a feeder 
device (3) which is connected to a tank (4) containing 

a supply of the liquid, and associated with a level 

control mechanism (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device applicable in 
particular to cooker hoods, or for other uses, which 
permits of obtaining a practically total purification 
of air directed through it. More particularly such a device enables a filtration of 
air polluted with various substances, which essentially 
is brought about by passing the air through a plurality 
of perforated discs partially immersed in a bath of 
suitable liquid and set in rotation, so as to occasion 
the condensation of volatile parts and induce a washing 
action by which odorous substances are also eliminated. 
There are conventional hoods of various types and for 
various applications of which the function is basically 
to gather in air polluted by a variety of substances 
given off during sundry operations such as the cooking 
of foods, or industrial processes, and convey it to an 
outlet in most cases externally of the environment in 
which the operations are conducted. In certain cases, again conventionally, the air drawn 
into the hood is returned to the same environment.  Clearly enough, it is desirable and in some instances 
necessary that the air drawn into the hood should be 
suitably filtered to prevent environmental pollution. Such a filtration is very often obtained by channelling 
the contaminated air into filters consisting simply in 
porous substances fashioned as panels or the like, by 
which pollutant particles are trapped when the air is 
passed through. These filtration systems are normally 
of scant efficiency since they are able to trap only 
such particles of the pollutant substances as are of a 
certain size and/or perhaps capable of condensing when 
passed through the porous filtration medium; moreover, 
the porous medium gradually becomes saturated with the 
continuing accumulation of particulate matter, to the 
point of losing its capacity for filtration altogether, 
and must therefore be replaced periodically. To obtain a more effective filtration, conventionally 
in certain instances, the contaminated air is directed 
through panels containing activated carbon granules 
which are indeed able ultimately to absorb and trap 
volatile substances composed of minute particles, such 
as vapours and even gases, but which will also release 
such particulates easily thereafter if invested by dry 
air; furthermore, the effectiveness of the absorption 
process is inversely proportionate to any increases in  
 
temperature and velocity of the contaminated air being 
filtered, and finally, it is obvious in this instance

<CLAIMS>
1) A device for the purification of air applicable in 
particular to cooker hoods, 

characterized 
in that it comprises an external housing composed 

essentially of a cylindrical casing (11) capped at the 
ends by two covers (11, 12) furnished on the parts 

located uppermost with relative couplings (122, 131) 
for connection respectively to a hood, in such a way 

that contaminated air entering the hood can be drawn 
into the casing, and to a vent duct equipped with an 

extractor device such as a fan unit or the like, also, 
a plurality of perforated metal discs (16) disposed 

internally of and coaxial with the cylindrical casing 
(11), suitably distanced one from the next and secured 

centrally to a relative shaft (15) mounted coaxially in 
the casing (11) with suitable supporting elements (14) 

and coupled at one end to a geared electric motor (2) 
by means of which both the shaft (15) and the relative 

perforated metal discs (16) are driven in rotation; 
in that the lower half of the housing is part-filled 

with a liquid providing a bath in which the bottom 
parts of the perforated metal discs (16) are immersed; 

and in that it further comprises a feeder device (3) 
associated with the housing, by which the housing is 

 
connected with a tank (4) containing a supply of the 

liquid, means (31) by which to control the level of the 
bath and allow its replenishment from the tank (4) when 

the level drops, and a drain outlet (5) located in the 
bottom part of the housing and sealable with a relative 

plug (51), such as will allow a periodic disposal of 
the liquid which during the course of operation becomes 

gradually laden with pollutant substances removed from 
the air passing through the device. 
2) A device as in claim 1, wherein the perforated metal 
discs (16) or at least part thereof are embodied with 

radial creases generating corresponding radial portions 
of which the surfaces are angled in relation to the 

direction of the airflow internally of the device, in 
such a manner that the perforated metal discs (16) are 

invested with rotational movement by the flow of air. 
3) A device as in claim 1, further comprising elements 
interposed between the perforated metal discs (16) and 

embodied with radial vanes angled in relation to the 
direction of the airflow internally of the device in 

such a way that the perforated metal discs (16) are 
invested with rotational movement by the flow of air. 
4) A device as in preceding claims, wherein the angular 

velocity of a rotational movement of the perforated 
metal discs (16) generated by the airflow internally of 

 
the device is governed by suitable speed control means 

of conventional embodiment. 
5) A device as in claim 1, wherein the perforated metal 
discs (16) can be fashioned from an expanded metal or 

mesh of which the mesh apertures are equivalent in size 
to the holes pierced in a corresponding perforated disc 

fashioned from sheet metal.
