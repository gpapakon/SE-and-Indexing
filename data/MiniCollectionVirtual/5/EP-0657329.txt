<ABSTRACT>
An air bag device (10) is comprising a first air bag (11) 
accommodated in a steering pad and receiving an occupant 

by the inflation and deployment during a collision and a 
second air bag (12) seamed with a portion of said first air 

bag (11) and being inflatable in a ring shape to cover a 
surface of a steering wheel (2) facing to the occupant, 

wherein said first air bag (11) and said second air bag (12) 
having gas communicating holes (20) at a seaming portion 

between them, said first air bag (11) being inflated by 
introducing gas from gas generating means (5) connected to a 

gas inlet of said first air bag and said second air bag (12) 
being inflated at the same time by introducing gas 

through said gas communicating holes (20). In a second 
embodiment, the second air bag is inflated by introducing gas from gas 

generating means connected to a gas inlet of the second air bag and the 

first air bag is inflated at the same time by introducing gas through 
the gas communicating holes. In a third embodiment, gas generating means 

are connected to a gas inlet of the first air bag and to a gas inlet of 
the second air bag separately and the two bags are inflated by 

introducing gas through the separate gas paths from the gas generating 
means at the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air bag device,
more particularly, to an air bag device which can
prevent an occupant from bumping against a steering
wheel, absorb an impact force applied to the occupant's
head and chest and reliably protect the occupant.Recently, an air bag device is adopted to various
kinds of vehicles as a passive occupant protection
system for efficiently protecting an occupant from the
action of the impact force at a collision.The purpose of the air bag device is to prevent the
occupant from a secondary collision in a cabin by
receiving the occupant's body, particularly, the head
and chest with a bag shaped cushion filled with gas
during a collision.As shown in Fig. 1, a position D1 of an occupant in
a driver's seat moves to the position D2 at a collision,
the occupant is protected by being pushed to the
deployed air bag 54 at his chest and head. Thereby, the
occupant is protected from the secondary collision, that
is, the occupant plunges into and bumps against a
steering wheel or a windshield of the vehicle.As shown in Fig. 2 (a), an air bag device is
proposed wherein the air bag device has a conventional
air bag (hereinafter, the air bag shown by an alternate
long and short dash line is called by "main bag") and an
air bag formed in a ring shape to cover a periphery of
the steering wheel (hereinafter, the air bag formed in a
ring shape and disposed a periphery of the main bag is
called by "sub bag") and both air bags are deployed
(See Journal of Technical Disclosure published by Japan
Institute of Invention and Innovation, Technical
Disclosure No. 88-15251, Published Unexamined Utility 
model No. 1989-122349).In the air bag device disclosed in the Journal of
Technical Disclosure No. 88-15251, as shown in Fig. 2(a)
and Fig. 2(b), the sub bag 61 is folded and accommodated
in a hollow rim 62 of the steering wheel 70 and gas for
inflation and deployment is introduced into the sub bag
61 through a spoke 63 acting also as a gas pipe as shown
by the arrow. The hollow rim 62 has a tear line 64 is
formed at a predetermined position thereof. As the gas
is introduced into the sub bag 61 to apply an inner
pressure, the tear line 64 breaks and portions 62a of
the hollow rim 62 is expanded in a direction of the
arrow B, then the sub bag 61 accommodated inside the
hollow rim 62 expands like a rush. At the same time,
the main bag 66 expands and deploys so as to prevent the
occupant moving in a direction of the arrow A from
bumping against the steering wheel 70 and to protect the
occupant's
