<ABSTRACT>
To equalise textile sliver material at a drawing station, with separately driven sliver feed and take-off, the opening sliver mass (EM) is measured in freely selected steps by an absolute value transmitter (4), independently of the sliver speed and the measuring values. Each measured value (IW/EM) has an absolute lie together with a reaction point (SW/R). Both values (IW/EM, SW/R) are stored together in memory (S). The actual value (IW/EM) is interrogated at its lie in a freely selected point (R), to be used as a rotary speed nominal value (SW/D) for the motor (M1) through a frequency setter (fN). A cross section of the sliver is pref. formed from a freely selected number of actual measurements (IW/EM), to be stored in memory (S) with a related reaction point (SW/R).

Process for equalizing textile slivers (fiber bands) in a drawing field with sliver 
feed rollers and sliver delivery rollers, whereby 


the mass of the undrawn sliver is measured, 
the values that are measured at intervals are successively stored, 
a delay time is specified between the measuring process and the initiation of the 
correction process, 
the stored measured values used for initiating the correction process are routed as 
rotational speed setpoint values to the motor (M1) of the feed rollers (2), 
 
characterized by the fact 


that absolute measured values (IW/EM) for the mass of the sliver are recorded in freely 
selectable steps (x), 
that these measured values (IW/EM) are stored in a memory (S) that is managed by a 
processor (P), 
that the stored measured values (IW/EM) are processed in groups and converted to an 
average value by means of a processor (P), 
that the average values (IW/EM) are stored in a form retrievable by the processor (P) 
together with the data (SW/R) 
of a reaction point defined as related to its position
 
and 
that the average values (IW/EM) at the reaction point (R) are retrieved by the 
processor (P) 
independent of time according to a specified path traveled by the 
motor
 and are routed in the form of rotational speed setpoint values (SW/D) to the 
motor (M1) 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by the fact that the average 
values (IW/EM) are each combined with the data (SW/R) of the reaction point (R) to 

form a value pair (IW/EM/ /SW/R) and
 
that the value pair (IW/EM/ /SW/R) is retrieved from the data (SW/R) of the reaction 

point (R) by means of the processor (P) and routed as a rotational speed control 
output (SW/D) to the motor (M1). 
Process in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterized by the fact 

that the average value derived from the successively stored measured values (IW/EM) 
of a measured range and 
that the value pair (IW/EM/ /SW/R) that comprises this average value is then retrieved 
when the beginning of this measured section reaches the reaction point (R).
