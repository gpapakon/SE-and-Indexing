<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermal overcurrent trip (release) for an electrical switching device, in particular for a line protection circuit breaker, having a thermostatic bimetallic strip in the form of a snap-action disc which jumps (snaps) over from a first stable position into a second stable position in the event of a temperature increase and by means of which a drive train for permanently switching off the moving contact piece is driven, the snap-action disc (11) preferably being directed with its convex rounded side (12) against the carrier (10, 20) through which the current (I) flows.
