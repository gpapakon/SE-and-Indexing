<ABSTRACT>
In a rotating body or machinery that is equipped with at 
least one such rotating body, the power lost resulting from 

the inertia force, which is an internal force caused by the 
rotation of the rotating body, is the cause of worsened 

mechanical efficiency, as well as is the cause of unnecessary 
heat generation, unnecessary machine strength, increased 

weight, and increased costs. 
The objective of this invention is to provide a low-loss 
machine or engine that essentially eliminates or greatly 

reduces the power loss due to the aforementioned inertia 
force. 
The rotating body of this invention, or machine which is 
equipped with at least one such rotating body, greatly reduces 

or essentially makes zero the power loss resulting from the 
inertia force generated by the rotating or rocking motion of 

the rotating body due to its poor mass distribution. This 
inertia force is an internal force of a new concept which 

excludes the centrifugal force.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotating body that performs
rotating motion or rocking motion, and to a machine that uses
at least one such rotating body. The machine defined in this
patent includes a wide variety of mechanisms, machines, and
mechanical equipment.The prior art of reducing the power lost during operation of
a rotating body that performs rotating motion or rocking
motion, or a machine that uses at least one such rotating body
covers many various technical fields such as reducing the
weight of components, improving the mechanism, and improvement
of heat loss.However, theoretical background related to the improvement
of dynamic losses of a rotating body caused by inertia forces
that are generated due to rotating motion or rocking motion
has been full of blank areas.Power defined by dynamics is expressed as the product of the
two vector quantities: force and the velocity of the point
where the force acts. In other words, if the vectors of the
two physical quantities mentioned above are perpendicular to
each other, the power required to move the body is no longer
there. Until now, it has been thought that the power related to the
inertia force, including the centrifugal force, generated in a
rotating body due to circular motion or rotating motion
disappears as described above. The reason for this is the
mistake of thinking that the two vectors, inertia force and
the velocity of the point on which it acts, are perpendicular.This invention relates to the technical range that up until
now has not been completely made clear, and improves the power
losses caused by inertia forces generated by the rotation of a
rotating body.Formerly, the unnecessary power lost in a rotating body of a
machine that is in operation, was the cause of harmful heat
generation, and required the use of cooling equipment to
relieve this problem, or increased mechanism strength,
increased weight, and increased cost necessary for coping with
the inertia force.The objective of this invention is to partially solve the
aforementioned problems of the prior art, and to provide a
rotating body and a machine that uses at least one such
rotating body that reduces the unnecessary power losses.In more particular, the objective of this invention is to
provide a rotating body and a machine that uses at least one
such rotating body, and that by taking the axis of center of
the rotating motion or rocking motion of the
rotating body as the X-axis, reduces or essentially makes zero
the deviation of the principal axis of inertia, which is the
