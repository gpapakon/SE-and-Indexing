<ABSTRACT>
An optical code reader includes a reading window 
(4a), a reading control circuit (5, 7, 41 to 50) for 

sensing an image of a 2-dimensional code via the reading 
window (4a) in a state where the reading window (4a) is 

set within a preset distance from the 2-dimensional code 
and converting the sensed image into image data, a guide 

light source (8) for applying a guide beam light to 
permit the 2-dimensional code to be guided within the 

reading range of the reading control circuit (5, 7, 
41 to 50), and a portable frame (4) having an opening 

used as the reading window (4a), for accommodating the 
reading control circuit (5, 7, 41 to 50) and guide light 

source (8). In the optical code reader, the guide light 
beam indicates the center of the reading range and is 

applied from the guide light source (8) except for a 
period during which the image of the 2-dimensional code 

is sensed by the reading control circuit (5, 7, 41 to 
50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical code reader
for reading a 2-dimensional code affixed to an article,
and more particularly to an optical code reader which
can be held by hand and set close to the 2-dimensional
code at the time of reading.Most supermarkets utilize bar codes printed on
article labels for sales registration. The bar code
represents an article code by a combination of bars
linearly arranged and is optically read by a handy type
bar code scanner which can be held by hand and set close
to the bar code at the time of reading, for example. In
recent years, the application field of the bar code is
expanded to factories, distribution industries, service
businesses and the like. In these fields of application,
it is necessary to represent article information
other than the article code for article management by
use of the bar code. Therefore, the recording capacity
of the bar code tends to become insufficient. By taking
this condition into consideration, 2-dimensional codes
such as multi-bar codes and matrix array codes are
developed to deal with a large amount of article information.The conventional 2-dimensional code scanner is
constructed by connecting a TV camera, TV monitor and
image processor to each other via cables, for example.
The TV camera takes an image of the 2-dimensional code 
printed on an article label in the interior illumination,
the TV monitor displays the image of the
2-dimensional code taken by the TV camera, and the image
processor effects the image processing operation to
derive article information from the 2-dimensional code
image. The article information is transmitted to an
external host computer connected to the image processor
via a communication circuit, for example.However, the 2-dimensional code scanner is large,
heavy and expensive. Further, the operator is required
to set the article label to face the TV camera without
inclination and adjust the focus and aperture of the TV
camera, so that the 2-dimensional code can be correctly
read. This makes the start of reading delayed.The above problem is considered to be solved by
constructing the 2-dimensional code scanner such that it
can be held by hand at the time of reading like the
handy type bar code scanner. However, since the
2-dimensional code cannot be read when it is set partly
out of the reading range, the operator must pay much
more attention to the projection of the 2-dimensional
code at this time than at the time of reading of the bar
code. The present invention departs from a bar code reader as known
