<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring sensor for the spectroscopic 
analysis of gas mixtures by means of a silent electrical 

discharge. A measuring sensor (1) includes a chamber (4), 
provided with a wall (16) made of a dielectric material, flow 

connections (5, 6) in this wall for carrying therethrough a gas 
mixture to be analyzed into (G₁) and out of (G₂) the chamber at 

a pressure (P) equal to that of ambient air, electrodes (2, 3) 
on the opposite sides of the chamber with a high alternating 

voltage (U) applied therebetween, and at least one window (8) in 
this wall, which is permeable to wavelengths to be measured. In 

addition, the sensor includes a light detector element (12) for 
measuring the intensity of a radiation coming through the window. 

Said high alternating voltage (U) has a frequency which is at 
least in the order of 10 kHz for developing in a gas mixture (G) 

a radiation emission based on the non-ionizing excitation of 
molecules and/or atoms. A measuring arrangement of the invention 

includes a measuring sensor operating on some other measuring 
principle, which produces a signal for analyzing at least one 

other gas component included in the gas mixture by using a 
computing unit. The measuring values can be output separately 

or used for checking the analyzing results received from various 
measuring sensors and, if necessary, for effecting corrections 

on the results.

The present invention relates to a measuring sensor for the spectroscopic analysis of
gas mixtures by means of a silent electrical discharge, the measuring sensor
comprising a chamber which includes: a wall made primarily of a dielectric material
and surrounding the chamber; through-going flow connections in this wall for passing
a gas mixture to analyzed into and out of the chamber at a pressure approximately
equal to that of ambient air; electrodes on the opposite sides of the chamber with a
high alternating voltage applied therebetween; and at least one window included in
this wall and permeable to wavelengths to be measured; and comprising at least one
light detector element positioned for measuring the intensity of radiation admitted
through said window. The invention relates also to a measuring arrangement for the
analysis of gas mixtures, the measuring arrangement comprising at least: a measuring
sensor operating on a spectroscopic first measuring principle and including a light
detector element which produces an electrical signal for the radiation emission which
is provided by a quiet electrical discharge occurring in a gas mixture and produced by
a high-voltage electrical field in said gas mixture which is at a pressure approximately
equal to that of ambient air and in a certain volume; and a computing unit for the
determination of at least a first gas component to be measured at any given time
and/or the concentration thereof on the basis of a received electrical signal.In particular, the invention relates to a sensor and a measuring arrangement for
measuring the concentration of such gas components included in gases and gas
mixtures which, on the one hand, contain gas components which have no infrared
absorption or which cannot be measured paramagnetically or by other passive
measuring techniques and which typically contain gas components that are readily
dissociated by the action of externally introduced activation energy, such as an
electrical field or a like.The measuring sensor and arrangement are especially applicable for measuring the
concentration of nitorgen, helium, argon, xenon and other noble gases included in gas
mixtures, such as those used in anesthesia. The measuring sensor and arrangement
may also be applicable for measuring the concentrations of hydrogen, chlorine and
fluorine.In gas mixtures, the measurements for the concentrations of gas components are most
commonly based on infrared technique, wherein the infrared absorption induced by a
gas in permeating radiation is
