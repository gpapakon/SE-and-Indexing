<ABSTRACT>
A conveying apparatus (4) has a capture region (6) where the sticks 
(2) of ice-cream bars (1) are raised from their horizontal positions on 

supply plates (5) into vertically oriented positions and are captured by 
grippers (7). 
In a release region (10), the sticks (2) are released to fall lightly 
onto the strips of 8-lane wrapping machine (11). 
The grippers (7) are carried by pairs of bars (8,9) extending 
transversely to the path of a conveyor carrier chain (12). 
With the gripper bars (8,9) in an adjacent condition, 16 grippers are 
equally spaced from one another, and are alternately carried by the two 

different bars (8,9) 
First, the bars (8,9) are urged transversely apart in the longitudinal 
direction of the carrier chain (12) and finally displaced longitudinally 

with respect to each other so that the two sets of grippers (7) are in 
register with each other and that the original 16 lines of ice-cream 

bars (2) are halved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conveying apparatus for receiving 
a plurality of input lines of articles and for rearranging 
the articles into a lesser number of output lines of 
articles. The invention also relates to a packaging 
apparatus comprising the combination of the conveying 
apparatus with a wrapping apparatus for receiving the output 
lines of articles, the wrapping apparatus being adapted to 
produce individually wrapped articles. It is common practice for food product articles, such as 
frozen confectionery, to be produced on a continuous or 
semi-continuous production machine in a series of parallel 
lines, for example there may be 16 lines of articles issuing 
from an oven or from a freezer. Multi-line wrapping 
machines having such a large number of lines are known but 
they cannot usually incorporate rotary sealing means since 
the bulk of rotary sealing heads is too great. 
Non-rotatable sealing heads could be employed but there are 
considerable disadvantages associated with the use of such 
heads. There is therefore a general need for a conveying apparatus 
which can rearrange lines of articles into a lesser number 
of lines. A particular need arises in the handling of stick-mounted 
confectionery, ie lollies and ice cream bars on sticks. The term 'stick' is used herein to cover any elongate 
carrier or handle for mounting confectionery, and it should 
be appreciated that a stick need not be made of wood.  Proposals have been made for handling ice-cream bars on 
sticks for reducing the number of lines of bars, but 
existing proposals involve the use of reciprocating plates 
which push on the bars to control the repositioning of the 
bars. Since frozen ice-cream bars are often coated with a 
relatively delicate outer coating, of chocolate for example, 
the use of such plates engaging directly with the ice-cream 
bars is undesirable. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
conveying apparatus is arranged to reposition articles 
whilst the articles are held by a plurality of gripping 
means, the gripping means being rearranged in relative 
position so as to reduce the number of lines of products. In a preferred embodiment an elongate gripper assembly 
comprises parallel first and second elongate gripper 
carriers, the first gripper carrier carrying a first set of 
grippers longitudinally spaced-apart along the first gripper 
carrier, and the second gripper carrier similarly carrying a 
second set of longitudinally spaced-apart grippers, the 
spacing of the grippers of the

A conveying apparatus (4) arranged to reposition articles (1) 
whilst the articles (1) are held by a plurality of gripping means 

(7), the gripping means being re-arrangeable in relative position so 
as to reduce the number of lines of articles (1) being conveyed, 

characterised in that the gripping means (7) comprise an elongate 
gripper assembly formed by parallel first and second elongate 

gripper carriers (8, 9), the first gripper carrier (8) carrying a 
first set of grippers (7) longitudinally spaced-apart along the 

first gripper carrier, and the second gripper carrier similarly 
carrying a second set of longitudinally spaced-apart grippers (7), 

the spacing of the grippers of the first set corresponding to the 
spacing of the grippers of the second set, the arrangement being 

such that the first and second gripper carriers are relatively 
movable from an out-of-phase adjacent condition. 
A conveying apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that the gripper carriers (8, 9) are adjacent to each other in said 

adjacent condition with the gripper means (7) of the first set 
alternating out-of-phase longitudinally with the gripper means (7) 

of the second set and being substantially in line therewith, whereas 
in the separated condition of the gripper carriers (8, 9) the first 

set of gripper means (7) are substantially longitudinally in 
register (in-phase) with the second set of gripper means (7) but 

with the first and second sets displaced from each other in a 
direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the gripper 

carrier (8, 9). 
A conveying apparatus as claimed in claims 1 or 2 
characterised in that the first and second gripper carriers (8, 9) 

are arranged for movement apart and adjacent to each other, in the 
direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of each gripper 

carrier (8, 9), by the contraction and extension of a carrier chain 
 

(12), wherein adjacent links of the carrier chain (12) respectively 
carry the first and second gripper carriers (8, 9) and are arranged

region (6) to an article release region (10).
