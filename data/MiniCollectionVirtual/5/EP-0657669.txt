<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a seal arrangement in a 
resilient moulded plastics body (10) having a bore (11) 

open at one end (12) to receive a cylindrical 
component. The seal is formed by a plurality of 

resiliently flexible annular lips (22) moulded 
integrally with the bore at spaced locations along the 

bore and extending inwardly of the bore to seal with the 
surface of a cylindrical component (e.g. a tube) 

inserted in the bore. The lips are angled to extend 
both inwardly and axially along the bore towards said 

open end to receive the cylindrical component. 
Preferably three sealing lips are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to moulded plastics
coupling bodies for tube couplings.GB-A-1520742, 1573757 and 2132295 disclose tube
couplings in which a coupling body has throughway open
at one end to receive a tube with an internal tapered
cam surface converging towards the open end of the body
in which a collet is disposed with resilient arms which
engage the taper cam surface to be forced inwardly
thereby to grip and hold the tube in the body. The
throughway in the body is formed with a step facing
towards the open end and an O-ring seal is located in
the throughway adjacent the step to form a seal between
the outer surface of the tube and the inner surface of
the coupling body to prevent loss of fluid therefrom.GB-A-2172356 discloses a further form of tube
coupling body generally in accordance with the above
arrangement and provided with an inner liner extending
lengthwise of the body with integral annular seals for
sealing with a tube extending into the body.EP-A-0518679 which forms the basis for the
preamble to claim 1 as set out hereinafter discloses a
further form of tube coupling body in which the body is
moulded in an elastomeric material and a throughway in
the body has integral V-section sealing rings moulded
around the inner surface of the throughway for sealing
engagement with a tube inserted into the coupling body.This invention provides moulded plastics coupling
body for a tube-coupling having a throughway open at one 
end to receive a tube and a plurality of resiliently
flexible annular lips moulded integrally with the
coupling body at spaced locations along the throughway
to seal with a surface of a tube inserted into the
throughway, wherein the lips are angled to extend both
inwardly and along the throughway towards the open end
thereof to receive the tube. Preferably three or more lips
are provided as appropriate according to the length of
bore available.In one application, the coupling body is adapted
to fit in a further component. In the latter case the
body may have encircling sealing means for sealing with
the further component into which it is to be fitted.In a further arrangement according to the
invention the body may be formed with an integral
openable diaphragm for closing the bore in the body.By way of example the diaphragm may be formed with
a multiplicity of radially extending slits to create a
number of fingers formed integrally with the bore of the
body which can be deflected to open the bore in the
body.In a still further arrangement the body may have a
flap valve for

<CLAIMS>
A moulded plastics coupling body (10) for a
tube-coupling have a throughway (11, 16) open at one

end (12) to receive a tube and a plurality of
resiliently flexible annular lips (22) moulded

integrally with the coupling body at spaced locations
along the throughway (16) to seal with a surface of a

tube inserted into the throughway, characterised in
that the lips (22) are angled to extend both inwardly

and along the throughway towards the open end (12)
thereof to receive the tube.
A coupling body as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that three or more lips (22) are

provided.
A coupling body as claimed in Claims 1 or
claim 2, characterised in that the coupling body (10)

is adapted to fit in a further component.
A coupling body as claimed in Claim 3,
characterised in that the coupling body (10) has

encircling sealing means (26) for sealing with the
further component into which it is to be fitted.
A coupling body as claimed in any of Claims
1 to 4, characterised in that the coupling body (10)

is formed with an integral openable diaphragm (28) for
closing the throughway in the body.
A coupling body as claimed in Claim 5,
characterised in that the diaphragm (28) is formed

with a multiplicity of radially extending slits to
create a number of fingers (29) formed integrally with 

the throughway of the body which can be deflected to
open the throughway in the body.
A coupling body as claimed in any of Claims
1 to 4, characterised in that the body has a flap

valve (30) for closing the throughway in the body.
A coupling body as claimed in Claim 7,
characterised in that the flap valve (30) is hinged to

the body on one side thereof and has a ruptural
connection to the body on the other side thereof to

open when subjected to an excess pressure or load.
A coupling body as claimed in any of Claims
1 to 5, characterised in that a separate valve disc is

mounted in the throughway in the body trapped between
adjacent sealing lips to be released when subjected to

an excess load or pressure.
A coupling body as claimed in any of Claims
1 to 9, characterised in that the plastics body has an

extended reduced diameter neck section at the opposite
end of the throughway to said open end.
A coupling body as claimed in Claim 10,
characterised in that the neck section has an oval or

flattened cross-section. 
A tube coupling comprising a coupling body
as claimed in any of the preceding claims and a tube

locking device (19,20) located in the open end of the
throughway to receive and lock a tube in the body, and

said plurality of encircling lips being formed
adjacent said open end to receive and seal with a tube

located in the coupling body.
