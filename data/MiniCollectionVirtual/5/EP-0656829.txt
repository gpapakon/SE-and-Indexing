<ABSTRACT>
A process for the automatic centering of a corrugated liner (14) onto a corrugated blank (12), comprising the steps of providing a pair of opposed, longitudinally extending first fold lines (24) in the blank with the distance between the first fold lines being the width of the liner and defining therebetween a central portion (26) on the blank; providing a pair of longitudinally extending second fold lines (28) adjacent the sides of the blank and that are parallel to the first fold lines, the first and second fold lines being spaced apart a distance equal to the thickness of the liner and an outer edge panel (32) being defined on the blank between the second fold line and the sides of the blank; gluing the liner generally onto the central portion of the blank; folding the outer edge panels 90  upwardly about the first fold line; and bending downwardly the outer edge panels another 90  to contact the liner. A blank for use in such process is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of corrugated containers and, more particularly, to a
process of self-centering a corrugated liner member onto a container blank and a blank for use
in such a process.US-A-2, 021 254 relates to the wrapping of an outer decorative layer onto the box's supporting
substrate. In particular, the decorative layer is applied to a web of paperboard which is later
cut into three separate blanks for forming a box.In the construction of corrugated containers, it is common to place or glue a liner member on
the inner surface of a box blank to form a laminated structure. Usually, the fluting of the liner
is transverse to the fluting of the blank to increase the rigidity of the assembled product.
During the blank folding process, the liner may become misaligned if it has not been
precisely centered in its correct position on the blank. Such misalignment can comprise a
portion of the liner overlying one or more of the fold lines on the blank. Usually, the
placement of the liner member onto the blank is done by hand to attempt to ensure the correct
placement of the liner. Therefore, a process has been needed to eliminate the labour-intensive
step of precisely situating the liner on the blank.The above disadvantages are overcome by the present invention which comprises a self-centering
lamination process for corrugated containers and the blank therefor and also 
provides a cosmetically appealing appearance to an erected container by covering the fluting
of the exposed sides of the liner.
One aspect of the present invention provides a method of applying a corrugated liner member,
having a top surface and a bottom surface to the inner surface of a corrugated box blank
having outer edge panels hingeably connected thereto along fold lines which end panels have
outer edges and which are capable of being folded inwardly 180° so as to form a laminated
assembly, the method comprising the steps of: (a) causing the liner member to be secured
onto the inner surface and (b) folding the outer edge panels so that the inner surface of each
panel is in engagement with the top surface (34) of the liner member (14), thereby forming
the assembly characterised in that during step (b) the outer end panels are simultaneously
folded inwardly and upwardly about fold lines to align said liner member between fold lines.It is preferred that prior to securing the liner member onto the inner surface, a pair of parallel,
longitudinally extending fold lines along the inner surface of the blank intermediate

A method of applying a corrugated liner member (14), having a top surface (34) and a
bottom surface (36), to the inner surface (16) of a corrugated box blank (12) having outer

edge panels (32) hingeably connected thereto along fold lines (24) which edge panels have
outer edges (22) and which are capable of being folded inwardly 180° so as to form a

laminated assembly (10), the method comprising the steps of:

(a) causing the liner member (14) to be secured onto the inner surface (16); and
(b) folding the outer edge panels (32) so that the inner surface (16) of each panel (32) is in
engagement with the top surface (34) of the liner member (14), thereby forming the

assembly

   characterised in that during step (b) the outer edge panels (32) are simultaneously
folded inwardly and upwardly about fold lines (24) to align said liner member (14)

between fold lines (24).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 and further comprising the step of:

(c) applying pressure to the assembly for a predetermined period of time to form a
finished laminated assembly (10).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 and further comprising, prior to step (a), the step of
forming a pair of parallel, longitudinally extending fold lines (28) alo
ng the inner surface (16)
of the blank intermediate each of the fold lines (24) and outer edges (22) of the outer edge

panels (32), the distance between the fold lines of each pair of fold lines (24, 28) being
substantially equal to the thickness of the liner member (14) and the distance between the fold 

lines (24) of each pair of fold lines (24, 28) being substantially equal to the width of the liner
member (16).
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the securing step comprises
applying glue to the inner surface (16) of the blank (12), including the outer edge panels (32)

thereof, and placing the liner member (14) onto the inner surface (16).
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the securing step comprises the
steps of applying the glue to the bottom surface of the liner, placing the liner member onto the

inner surface (16) of the blank (12) and administering glue to the outer edge panels (32).
A laminated assembly, comprising:

(a) a corrugated liner member (14), having a bottom surface (36);
(b) a first glue applied to the bottom surface (36) of the liner member (14);
(c) a corrugated blank (12) having opposed side edges (22) and an inner surface
(16), which receives thereon the bottom surface (36) of the liner member (14), characterised

in that the blank further comprising:

(i) a pair of spaced-apart, parallel, longitudinally extending first fold lines

(ii) a central portion (26) on the inner surface (16) defined between the
first fold lines (24) and having a width substantially equal to the width of the liner (14);
(iii) a pair of longitudinally extending second fold lines (28) on the inner
surface (16) of the blank (12) between the first fold lines (24) and the side edges (22); 
(iv) an intermediate panel (30) formed between each first (24) and second

liner (14);
(v) an outer edge panel (32) defined between each of the second fold lines
(28) and the side edges (22) of the blank (12); and
