<ABSTRACT>
In the treatment of material comprising organic substances or provided with these substances, the material is heated to a temperature of at least 200 DEG C in a vacuum process chamber (1) at subatmospheric pressure in an inert atmosphere, the gases and vapours formed are condensed in a condensate separator (3), and the condensate is collected and recycled or disposed of. The organic substances are rubber, plastics and paints (surface coatings, lacquers, enamels, varnishes). The embrittled residues formed from these substances are comminuted, and the comminuted residues are collected and recycled or disposed of. If any metals are present in the material, the residues are separated off, collected and optionally comminuted. The process and the apparatus are preferably used for the treatment of     a) electrical cables,   b) solid metallic parts connected by means of rubber,   c) plastic containers containing colour pigments,   d) automotive steering wheels,   e) painted workpiece carriers and tools,   f) faultily painted metal parts,   g) automobile tyres and rubber cushioning of tracked vehicles, and   h) sealing elements.

Process for recycling products made of organic
materials in the form of rubber, plastics materials and/or

varnishes or provided with organic materials in the form of
rubber, plastics materials and varnishes at high

temperatures, the products being heated at subatmospheric
pressure in a non-reactive atmosphere to a temperature of at

least 200°C, the gases and vapours which are thereby
produced being condensed and the condensate being collected

and supplied to a recycling or disposal process,

characterised in that, in cases where the products contain
metallic components, the residues formed from the organic

substances are separated from the metallic components,
collected, comminuted and supplied to a recycling or

disposal process.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that, in
the presence of volatisable metallic components, the latter

are volatised, condensed and supplied to a recycling or
disposal process.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
greased and/or oiled products are degreased and/or de-oiled

in a preliminary cleaning step by heating at subatmospheric
pressure and the fats and/or oils are collected and supplied

to a recycling or disposal process.
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that the
preliminary cleaning is carried out at a lower temperature

than the treatment.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that, in
order to delay the volatisation of the volatisable metallic

components, the pressure is initially adjusted to below
atmospheric pressure but above the subsequent treatment

pressure during heating of the products, and the 
condensation heat of the initially volatised components is

used for heating colder zones within the same charge.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that, in
the treatment of products with metallic components, the

metallic components freed of the residues are supplied to a
recycling process.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that, in
the treatment of electrical cables with a coating of

plastics material and/or rubber, the cables are subjected to
a temperature of at least 200°C, the residues formed from

the coating are mechanically removed and the metallic
components of the cables are supplied to a recycling

process.
Process according to claims 1 and 6, characterised in
that metallic solid components connected by rubber, more

particularly vibration mounts, are accordingly treated and
the solid components are supplied to a recycling process.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
plastics material containers with dye pigments are subjected

to a temperature of at least 200°C, preferably at least
250°C, the plastics material components are volatised and

condensed and the dye pigments are collected.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
motor vehicle steering wheels with a metal core and a cover

of organic material are subjected to a temperature of at
least 250°C, the residues formed from the organic material

are separated from the metal core and the metal core is
supplied to a recycling process.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
paint-coated workpiece supports from a painting line are

subjected to a temperature of at least 200°C and the 
residues formed from the paint are removed from the

workpiece support.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
reject painted metal parts are subjected to a temperature of

at least 200°C and the residues formed from the paint are
removed from the metal parts and the metal parts are

supplied to a recycling process.
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that car tyres with wire inlays, which comprise a coating of

cadmium and/or zinc, are firstly embrittled and then the
batch temperature is increased to values at which the

cadmium and/or zinc evaporates at a given vacuum, the
embrittled rubber residues are removed and collected and the

vapours of cadmium and/or zinc are condensed and supplied to
a recycling process.
Device for carrying out the process according to one or
more of the preceding claims, characterised by a heatable

vacuum processing chamber (1), which by means of conduits
(2, 5) of a conduit system (2, 5, 9, 14) with valves (4, 7)
