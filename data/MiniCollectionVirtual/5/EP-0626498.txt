<ABSTRACT>
A motor is controlled to regulate the speed 
of a vehicle sliding door whose movement and speed are 

monitored. The motor control voltage is incrementally 
adjusted in direction to reduce a sensed speed error 

only if the door has moved a required distance while 
the door speed has been continuously outside of the 

desired speed range since the last incremental 
adjustment to the control voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of the 
speed of an electrically driven door on a motor 
vehicle. Electrically driven doors on a vehicle are 
generally known. For example, it is known to provide 
an electrically powered sliding door for a van in 
which the door is opened and closed by operation of an 
electric motor. The motor torque required to open or 
close the door typically varies with door position and 
vehicle inclination. For example, if the vehicle is 
stopped in a downhill heading, the gravity assist 
reduces the torque required by the motor to close the 
door. On the other hand, additional torque is 
required to close the door if the vehicle is on an 
uphill heading. If the motor is sized to close the 
door when the vehicle is on an uphill heading, 
application of full motor torque to close the door 
when on a downhill heading will result in a higher 
door speed. It is therefore desirable to provide for the 
control of the speed of the door movement so as to 
compensate for vehicle inclination and other factors 
that may affect door movement. It is the general object of the present 
invention to provide an improved powered door closure 
method for a vehicle that regulates the speed of 
operation of the door. A vehicle door control method in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised by the 
features specified in Claim 1. In a general form of the present invention, 
a motor is controlled to regulate the speed of the 
door whose movement and speed are monitored. The 
motor control voltage is incrementally adjusted in  
 
direction to reduce a sensed speed error only if the 
door has moved a required distance while the door 
speed has been continuously outside of the desired 
speed range since the last incremental adjustment to 
the control voltage. This provides for smooth control 
of door speed while permitting the degree of 
aggressiveness in control to be adjusted by the 
selection of the required movement of the door. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the required 
distance of door movement while the door speed is 
continuously too slow may be larger than the required 
distance of door movement while the door speed is 
continuously too fast. This results in a more 
aggressive control of door speed in response to an 
excessive speed versus the control in response to a 
speed that is too slow. Further, by making the 
minimum update period a function of the door movement, 
a desirable more aggressive reduction in a sensed 
excessive speed is inherent since the

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle door control method for a door 
controller including an electric drive means (108,70) 

and a power source (205,262,250) for supplying a pulse 
width modulated control voltage at a controlled duty 

cycle to the electric drive means for energising the 
electric drive means to drive a vehicle door (12) to a 

closed position, the electric drive means having a 
torque output varying in direct relationship to the 

controlled duty cycle, the method comprising the steps 
of sensing (124,205,390) door movement; sensing 

(124,205,372,394) door speed; determining (205,826) a 
distance of sensed door movement while the sensed door 

speed is continuously less than a desired speed since 
a last increase in the controlled duty cycle; 

determining (205,854) a distance of sensed door 
movement while the sensed door speed is continuously 

greater than the desired speed since a last decrease 
in the controlled duty cycle; increasing (205,836) the 

controlled duty cycle to increase the torque output of 
the electric drive means to increase door speed when 

the determined distance of sensed door movement while 
the sensed door speed is continuously less than the 

desired speed since a last increase in the controlled 
duty cycle exceeds a first predetermined distance; and 

decreasing (205,882) the controlled duty cycle to 
decrease the torque output of the electric drive means 

to decrease door speed when the determined distance of 
sensed door movement while the sensed door speed is 

continuously greater than the desired speed since a 
last decrease in the controlled duty cycle exceeds a 

second predetermined distance, whereby the door speed 
is controlled to the desired speed. 
A vehicle door control method as claimed 
in Claim 1, wherein the first predetermined distance  

 
is greater than the second predetermined distance, 

whereby the conditions for increasing door speed are 
more restrictive than the conditions for decreasing 

door speed.
