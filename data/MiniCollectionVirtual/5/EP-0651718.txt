<ABSTRACT>
A multiple cap (10) arrangement is provided to seal the open end of a container (12). The multiple cap seal includes a sealing cap (14) and locking cap (16) which are hingedly coupled to the open end of a container such as a disposable centrifuge container (12). The sealing cap (14) is lodged in the open end of the container (12) and the locking cap (16) coupled to the sealing cap by a mechanism that retains the caps essentially fixed relative to one another. With the caps coupled in this way, stress, resulting from pressure in the container (12), is transferred through the caps to the hinges. The hinges (22, 38) are sized to prevent axial movement of the interlocked sealing and locking cap structure away from the container. Since the hinges resist stretching even under substantial tension, the container remains reliably sealed even when the pressures in the container are very high.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a sealing device or
closure for a container, and more particularly, to a sealing
device having a releasable lock.Containers such as test tubes have been used for many years
to store sample materials such as liquids. There is often
a need to seal the open end of a test tube with a removable
cap to prevent contamination or loss of the sample while
allowing for subsequent re-access to the sample. Also, when
material has been placed in test tubes, it is sometimes
necessary to remove from or add to the material without
removing the cap. This can be done by using a syringe to
puncture the cap.
After a typical
container cap is punctured with a syringe, the punctured cap
cannot reseal the container.A typical removable cap relies on a frictional fit between
the cap and the inside surface of the test tube to seal the
test tube and to retain the cap. Sometimes the cap and test
tube are molded together from a plastic material, with the
cap attached to the test tube by a hinge. There are 
disadvantages to fractional cap seals. If the test tube is
dropped, the cap has a tendency to pop off, thus spilling or
contaminating the sample. Heating and cooling cycles can
loosen the cap, allowing it to come off the test tube.
Evaporation of a sample will often occur unless the cap
makes a hermetic seal with the test tube. The seal and the
retention of a friction fit cap can be heightened by
increasing the friction fit between the cap and test tube.
However, increasing the friction between cap and container
makes installation and removal of a cap much more difficult.
Such difficulty can cause user fatigue when the user must
cap or uncap many test tubes. Furthermore, it may be costly
to achieve a precise friction fit due to tight dimensional
constraints required for the inside surface of the tube and
the outside surface of the cap.It is known in other contexts to provide a container
having two hingedly connected members. For example,
US-A-3,587,944 describes a dispensing apparatus having
a plurality of integrally connected parts for use with
dispensing containers wherein the dispensing apparatus
has a portion framing a central aperture therethrough,
a first closure portion movable to close the aperture
and having at least one material-dispensing passageway
extending therethrough, and a second closure portion
having a passageway closing structure with the second
closure portion being movable relative to the first
closure portion to close the passageway.Nevertheless, according to a first aspect
