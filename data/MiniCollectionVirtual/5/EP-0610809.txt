<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to catalysts based on nitrogen-containing heterocyclic hydrocarbons for the disproportionation of aryl- and alkylhalodisilanes to give the corresponding mono- and polysilanes. The catalyst can be fixed to a support material. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the disproportionation of disilanes using these catalysts.

Use according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the heterocyclic hydrocarbon radical is a 5-membered

ring having from 1 to 3 N atoms.

arylhalogenodisilanes and/or alkylhalogenodisilanes,

characterized in that the reaction is carried out so as
to form monosilanes and polysilanes in the presence of

supported or unsupported catalysts according to Claims
1 to 10 at temperatures of from 50°C to 350°C.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the silanes are passed in vapour or gaseous form

over the supported catalyst and the reaction is carried
out at at least 100°C.
Process according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the reaction is carried out at from 120°C to

130°C.
Process according to Claims 11 to 13,
characterized in that the monosilanes formed are

isolated during the reaction by distillative removal.
Process according to Claims 11 to 14,
characterized in that the arylpolysilane- or
