<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to hysteresis synchronous
motors, and in particular, to controlling hysteresis
synchronous motors used in applications which require
extremely constant rotational velocity.Hysteresis synchronous motors can provide very constant
rotational speed when driven from a crystal oscillator based
input frequency. The operation of the motor is as follows.
A pair of quadrature drive signals, which may be either
square waves or sinusoidal, are applied to a pair of motor
windings which form the stator of the motor. The alternating
stator drive currents generate a magnetic field which
rotates at the frequency of the stator drive signals.The rotor is composed of a solid piece of ferrous
material. The magnetic field from the energized stator
windings induces a magnetic flux in the rotor thereby
forming corresponding magnetic poles. The rotating magnetic
field and the rotor magnetic field interact to generate a
torque that causes the rotor and motor shaft to rotate. In
response, the rotor accelerates until the angular velocity
of the rotor matches that of the rotating magnetic field.Any angular displacement between the rotating field and
the rotdr poles produces a restoring torque in the opposite
direction. In response, the rotor velocity changes to
reduce the angle thereby causing the rotor's frequency of
rotation to match the frequency of the rotating field. It
is this operation that provides the hysteresis motor with an
excellent long term stability.Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an electromechanical
model of a hysteresis synchronous motor. The motor can be
modeled as a second order system. More specifically, the
open loop gain of the motor is represented by equation 1
below: 
(1)   G(S) = KmS·(J·S+B)
where Km is a motor constant, J is the motor's inertia, B is
a damping factor, and S is a Laplace variable. For a
typical motor, these values can be: Km = 0.049 n x m/rad;
J = 1 x 10-4 kg x m2; and B = 5 X 10-4 n x m x s/rad.The closed loop motor transfer function is represented
by equation 2 below:
(2)   PoPi = KmJ·S2+B·S+Km
where Pi is a Phase input, and Po is a Phase output. In a
more standard form, the closed loop motor transfer function
is represented by equation 3 below:
(3)   PoPi = KmJS2+(BJ)·S+KmJUnfortunately, the dynamic response of this type of
motor is often underdamped, due to the low damping factor B,
and the size of the inertia J. Thus, the rotor frequency
tends to drift above and below the desired frequency (i.e.,
the frequency of the stator drive signals) as the
