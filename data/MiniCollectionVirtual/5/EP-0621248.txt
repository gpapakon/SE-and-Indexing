<ABSTRACT>
The device serves for composting organic wastes. It consists of at least one tunnel-like box (1), in the bottom region of which a continuous, rotating scraper-floor conveyor (8) is arranged. On one end side of the box, the introduction side (A), an obliquely upwardly directed conveyor belt (2) is arranged, with a charging box (3). On the other end side of the box (1), the discharge side (B), a second conveyor belt (2) arranged essentially parallel to the first-mentioned conveyor belt is provided. Both conveyor belts (2) are accommodated in housings (40) of the same design which can be flanged onto the end sides of the box (1). The scraper-floor conveyor (8) is formed by a number of chains which lie parallel to one another and are guided via drive and rotating rollers (12, 13). The chains are interconnected to transversely lying scraping strips. The upper halves of the chains are situated between longitudinally running ducts which are distanced from one another and on the upper side of which the scraping strips rest. These upper sides of the ducts have air outlet hoods. The ducts are connected to an incoming-air duct. These ducts are formed by downwardly open U-profiles.

Apparatus for the decomposition of organic waste, characterised by at least one tunnel-like 
box (1) in the base region of which there is arranged an endless, circulating scraper 

base conveyor (8), and an upwards inclined conveyor belt (2) is arranged at one end face 
of the box (1), the feed side (A), together with a feeding box (3), and a second conveyor 

belt (2) arranged substantially parallel to the first-mentioned conveyor belt is provided at 
the other end face of the box (1), the discharge side (B), and both conveyor belts (2) are 

housed in housings (40) of the same design which can be screwed on the end faces of the 
box (1). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the scraper base conveyor (8) 
is formed by a plurality of parallel chains (42) which are guided via drive and circulation 

rollers (12, 13) and are connected to one another by scraper strips (11) lying transverse to 
the circulating direction of the chains (42), and the upper strands of the chains (42) are 

located between longitudinally-extending channels which are located at a distance from 
one another and on the upper side of which the scraping strips (11) rest, and these upper 

sides of the channels have air discharge scoops (17) and the channels are connected to an 
air inlet channel (20). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that longitudinally-extending 
slide strips (43) serving to slidingly support the scraper strips (11) are fastened to the 

upper side of the channels and their height at least corresponds to the height of the air 
discharge scoops (17). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the channels are formed 
by downwards-open U-sections (44). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the axes of the air outlets of 
the air discharge scoops (17) lie in the conveying direction of the scraper base conveyor 

(8) or at least form an acute angle with the latter. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the U-sections (44) forming 
the channels lie in a trough (28) connected to an outlet pipe (29).  

 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that the outlet pipe (29) leads to a 
waste water container (30) arranged within the box (1) or a housing (40) for a conveyor 

belt (2), and a return line (33) leading into the tunnel-like box (1) is connected to this 
waste water container (30) and has a plurality of spraying nozzles (22) within the box 

(1). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that a process-water line (34) 
which can be opened and closed via a valve is connected to the return line (33), and the 

return line (33) runs via a dosing apparatus (35). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that a by-pass valve (21) is 
arranged in the air inlet channel (20), the air inlet channel (20) connected to the 

atmosphere being totally or partially connectable to the spent air space (23) of the tunnel-like 
box (1) by means of this by-pass valve (21). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 9, characterised in that the spent air space (23) of 
the tunnel-like box (1) is preferably connected via a spent air fan (25) to a filter (26) 

arranged on the tunnel-like box (1). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 10, characterised in that the base of the filter (26) is 
formed by a plurality of parallel U-sections (38) the open sides of which are directed 

downwards and which have air outlets at their upper side, and the channels formed by the 
U-sections (38) resting on a trough base (39) are connected to the spent air line issuing 

from the spent air fan (25). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the driving motors serving to 
drive the individual components lie and/or are encased exterior to the housing (40) or the 

tunnel-like box (1). 
Apparatus in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised in that at least one 
measuring probe (36) for determining the atmospheric moisture and/or the temperature 

and/or gas constituents etc. is provided within the tunnel-like box (1), and the measuring 
probe (36) is connected to an electronic program control device (37) which regulates or 

controls the driving motors of the individual components. 
Apparatus in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that a plurality 
of erected conveyor belts (2) and tunnel-like boxes (1) alternately follow one another in  

 
the direction of passage of the waste to be treated, erected conveyor belts (2) being 

arranged in housings (40) at the respective end faces of the tunnel-like boxes (1) 
following one another in a succession of this type. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the tunnel-like boxes (1) 
have a rectangular cross-section.
