<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an output driver circuit (1, 1'), especially an analog output driver circuit (1, 1'). Until now, in the case of such driver circuits (1, 1'), relays have been used to isolate the outputs (3, 3') in the event of dips in the supply voltage. According to the invention, the relay is replaced by an electronic output switching element (13, 13') which has a defined switching behaviour in a drive-free manner. The output switching element (13, 13') is preferably a normally-on field-effect transistor (13, 13'), one of whose connections is connected to the output line (3, 3') and the other of whose connections is connected to earth.
