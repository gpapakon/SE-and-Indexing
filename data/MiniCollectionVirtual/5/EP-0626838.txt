<ABSTRACT>
Apertured plastic films comprise a stretchable thermoplastic polymeric material having a plurality of microholes (37) defined by a network of fiber-like elements (38). The films are produced by directing fluids, especially water, against the upper surface of a starting film in the form of columnar streams in a contact zone, while the film is supported on a backing element. The films of the invention are useful as covering materials for absorbent products such as diapers, wound dressings and sanitary napkins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apertured films
and more particularly to apertured plastic films
comprising a plurality of micro-holes defined by a network
of fiber-like elements or micro-strips of drawn plastic
material. The invention also relates to methods and
apparatus for making such apertured films and to products
comprising such apertured films.Nonwoven fabrics have been used for a wide variety of
applications for at least fifty years. Nonwoven fabrics
are textile-like materials produced directly from a web of
fibers so as to eliminate the many time consuming steps
involved in converting staple length fibers into woven or
knitted goods. In one method of making a nonwoven fabric,
a web of fibers is produced, e.g. by carding or air laying
techniques, and the fibrous web is then strengthened by
the application thereto of a polymeric binding agent. In
another method of making a nonwoven, the fibrous web is
subjected to fluid forces which serve to entangle the
fibers, thus providing strength to the finished material.
Nonwoven fabrics are inherently porous structures, i.e.
they comprise openings or pores allowing for the passage
of fluids such as air and water or aqueous solutions. In
addition, nonwoven fabrics may be tailored so as to have
good softness, drapeability, and tactile impression.
Owing to their desirable characteristics, nonwovens have
been employed as facing materials for absorbent products 
such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent
devices, wound dressings and the like.More recently, efforts have been made to produce porous or
liquid-permeable facing materials for absorbent products
by using plastic films as the starting materials. For
example, it is known to produce an apertured plastic film
by placing a heated thermoplastic sheet material on a
patterned perforated surface and applying a vacuum
thereto. The vacuum pulls the softened sheet material
through the perforations, thereby causing the film to
rupture and form apertures.U.S. 3,929,135 to Thompson et al discloses perforated
topsheet materials for absorptive devices such as sanitary
napkins, incontinent pads, bandages and the like. These
topsheet materials are constructed from liquid impervious
materials such as low density polyethylene and comprise a
plurality of tapered capillaries each of which has a base
opening in the plane of the top sheet and an apex opening
which is remote from the plane of the top sheet. The
tapered capillaries disclosed by Thompson et al. are
preferably provided in the form of a
