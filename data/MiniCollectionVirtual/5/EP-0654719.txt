<ABSTRACT>
A configurable open-loop and closed-loop control device for use in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning installations has a parameterisable comfort controller (4) and at least one energy setting path (9.1; 9.2; 9.3) connected to the comfort controller (4) via a data interface (1). The energy setting path (9.1; 9.2; 9.3) has a fixed number of sequentially combined functional blocks (10.1, 10.2, 10.3) which can be selected for a specific application in a configuration phase in a functional block library. The comfort controller (4) generates normalised setting signals "heat" and "cool". In the energy setting path (9.1; 9.2; 9.3) the normalised setting signals stored in the data interface (1) are transformed into setting values which are matched to the actuators specified by the application. No programming operations have to be carried out in the configuration phase.

A configuratable control and regulating apparatus having an input 
(2) for at least one measurement parameter of a technical system (22.1; 

22.2) and an output (6) for at least one setting parameter of the technical 
system (22.1; 22.2) characterised by 


a data interface (1) connected to the input (2), 
a comfort regulator (4) which is connected to the data interface (1) 
and which has predefined regulating parameters and with which standardised 

output values for the data interface (1) can be generated, 
an output block (7) having the output (6), and 
at least one energy setting path (9.1; 9.2; 9.3) which is connected 
between the data interface (1) and the output block (7) and which has a 

fixed number (f) of function blocks (10.1, 10.2, 10.3) which can be selected 
from a function block library and which can be performed in time succession, 

with which energy setting path the setting parameter/parameters of the 
technical system (22.1: 22.2) can be produced using the output parameters of 

the comfort regulator (4). 
A control and regulating apparatus according to claim 1 
characterised by a function block (10.1; 10.2; 10.3) which has a stored data 

array in which parameters and/or data points and also a function code are 
associated with the function block (10.1: 10.2; 10.3). 
A control and regulating apparatus according to claim 1 
characterised by a two-dimensional matrix (M) which has a line for each 

energy setting path (9.1; 9.2; 9.3) and whose number of columns is equal to 
the number (f) of the function blocks (10.1, 10.2, 10.3) per energy setting 

path (9.1; 9.2; 9.3), wherein a configured function block (10.1; 10.2; 10.3) 
is precisely associated with an element of the matrix (M) and stored in the 

element are parameters and/or addresses or data points and also an address 
of the function code of the associated function block (10.1; 10.2; 10.3).

characterised by an activity (36) by which the matrix can be run line-wise 

sequentially by a procedure whereby the respective function code associated 
with the element is activatable by the activity (36) wherein after each 

running of the matrix the setting parameter/parameters is/are available at 
the end of the energy setting path (9.1; 9.2;9.3) in time-discrete fashion 

and after a respective predetermined period duration (T
A
) at the output (6).

preceding claims characterised in that 


the function value of a function block (10.1; 10.2; 10.3) is available 
in a setting value table (11), and
