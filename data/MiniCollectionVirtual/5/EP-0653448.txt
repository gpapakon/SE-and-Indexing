<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to grafted copolymers which 
contain an acrylic acid ester polymer, vinyl chloride and 
a copolymer containing units of ethylene, carbon monoxide and n-butyl 
acrylate; and to their use in preparing self-supporting films 
(sheets) and moulded articles. More particularly, the present invention relates to a thermoplastic 
graft copolymer comprising (a) an acrylic acid ester polymer; (b) 
vinyl chloride; and (c) a copolymer consisting essentially, by weight, 
of (i) 40-80% ethylene; (ii) 3-30% carbon monoxide; and (iii) 5-60% 
of n-butyl acrylate; and their aforementioned use in preparing films 
and moulded articles. The grafted copolymers of the present invention are useful for 
producing films and moulded articles demonstrating good tensile 
properties, hardness and tear resistance. They also possess good low 
temperature properties, aging, weather and oil resistance, and form 
smooth surfaces that can be glued and welded. Typical end-uses 
suitable for the grafted copolymers include automobile dashboard 
panels and waterproofing liners. Graft copolymers of vinyl chloride, acrylic acid esters and ethylene-vinyl 
acetate-carbon monoxide are known (cf. EP 0 224 913 B1; US 
Patent 4,752,639). These graft polymers have desirable performance 
characteristics, including good tensile strength and elongation at 
break. It has now been found that certain of these properties, 
including elongation at break and tear resistance, can be surprisingly 
improved by particular selection of the copolymer to be grafted with 
vinyl chloride and acrylic acid ester.  Terms as used herein have the following meanings. Component (a) of the graft copolymer according to the invention, i.e. 
acrylic acid ester copolymers, is known in the art. The "acrylic acid 
esters" of the acrylic acid ester copolymers are preferably alkyl 
acrylates having 4-18 carbon atoms in the repeating unit. A 
particularly preferred alkyl acrylate is butyl acrylate. Component (a) is preferably comprises 20-60% by weight of the graft 
copolymer, more preferably 30-50%, still more preferably 35-45% by 
weight. Component (b) of the graft copolymer according to the invention, i.e. 
vinyl chloride, preferably comprises 30-70% by weight of the graft 
copolymer, more preferably 30-50%, still more preferably 35-45% by 
weight. Component (c) of the graft copolymer according to the invention is 
likewise known in the art. It can be represented by the formula (I) 
wherein x, y and z are chosen to provide the percentage ranges of 
eth
