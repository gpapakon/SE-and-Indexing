<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for preventing electrical crosstalk particularly in the case of circuit arrangements (substrates) which are fitted such that they are isolated by partition walls in a housing which can be closed on all sides, and which are suitable for the RF domain, especially the GHz band. In this case, an RF absorber plate, into which the pattern of the partition walls is introduced, is inserted into the housing, between the housing cover and the partition walls.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the avoidance of electrical crosstalk between several circuit
arrangements, particularly for circuits in high-frequency technology, wherein


the circuit arrangements are arranged separated from one another by at least one
partition in a common housing closable all round by a housing cover,
the height of the partitions is reduced at least in the region, which is to be
electrically attenuated, of the housing so that a presettable spacing arises between

these and the metallic housing cover,
the region is covered over the entire area by plate-shaped HF absorbing material
(absorbing plate) and
the HF absorbing material is secured with respect to the housing and/or the cover
against mechanical displacements,

characterised thereby

that the thickness of the HF absorbing material is in itself greater than the spacing
between the partitions and the housing cover,
that a depression pattern corresponding to that of the partitions is worked into the
HF absorbing material,
that the HF absorbing material has at the depressions a thickness which is less
than equal to the spacing between the partitions and the housing cover,
that a spacing less than 2.0 λ is kept between the HF absorbing material and the
housing and/or the HF absorbing material and the housing cover, wherein λ

signifies the wavelength of the frequency to be attenuated, and
that at least one rubber-elastic spacer is inserted between the HF absorbing
material and the housing cover for the mechanical securing of the former.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the depression
design is produced by an electronically controlled milling machine.
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the depression
design is formed as complement (negative) to the pattern of the partitions.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that

an HF absorbing material is selected which for the frequency to be attenuated consists of
a mechanically workable, filled synthetic material (absorbing receiver).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that
depressions, which correspond to the pattern of the partitions, are formed in the HF

absorbing material and that additional partitions and/or support walls consisting of
absorbing material and/or insulating material are formed at the HF absorbing material.
