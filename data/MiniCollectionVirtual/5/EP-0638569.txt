<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel bicyclic 
compound containing nitrogen atom and a physiologically 
acceptable salt thereof, which has cognition enhancing 
activity, and a cognition enhancer comprising the same as 
an effective ingredient. With increasing a population of aged 
generation, dementia is occupying large weight in care 
of the aged. Although many medicines have been 
developed in order to improve various types of dementia 
such as dysmnesia, they are not fully enough in the 
points of efficacy, persistence and side effect. For example, the function of cholinergic 
nervous system in hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral 
cortex is depressed in brains of patients of Alzheimer's 
disease (Pope et al., Trans. Am. Neurol. Assoc., 89, 
15 (1964), Bowen et al., Brain, 266, 558 (1976) and 
Davies et al., Lancet, ii, 1043 (1976)). The above-mentioned 
is considered to be firmly concerned with 
nosogenesis of the impairment of memorization or memory 
which is main symptom of Alzheimer's disease 
(Whitehouse et al., Science, 215, 1237 (1982)). 
Therefore, there is a possibility that these 
disturbances are improved by potentiating cholinergic 
nervous system. However, agonists of muscarinic 
cholinergic receptor which have been used up to date 
have high toxicity in spite of showing efficacy and 
therefore have not been practically used (Wettsein et 
al., Psychopharmacology, 84, 572 (1984) and Hollander et 
al., Biol. Psychiatry, 22, 1067 (1987)). So, more effective and safe medicaments are 
required for the above-mentioned diseases.  As a result of continuous effort and detailed 
investigation of the present inventors in view of the 
above-mentioned actual circumstances, it has now been 
found that a novel bicyclic compound containing nitrogen 
atom and a salt thereof show anti-amnesic activity by oral 
administration in animal experiments such as experimental 
amnesic mice, that the above-mentioned compounds 
potentiate central cholinergic neural function as a 
characteristic of anti-amnesic activity by acting on 
muscarinic cholinergic receptors and that toxicity of the 
above-mentioned compounds is low. Therefore the above-mentioned 
compounds have been found to be useful as a 
cognition enhancer, and thus the present invention has 
been accomplished. The present invention relates to a bicyclic 
compound containing nitrogen atom which has the general 
formula (I): 
wherein X is
 
a methylene chain of -(CH₂)n²- wherein n² is an integer of 
0 to 4,
 
carbonyl group of 
or
 
a group of
