<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for
concealing error data of pixel data in a received digital
image signal, such as may be applied to recording and/or
reproducing a digital image signal with a digital video
tape recorder (VTR) which uses, for example, a highly
efficient coding technique.When a digital video signal is recorded on a recording
medium such as a magnetic tape, the amount of information
of the digital video signal is large. In recent years, to
deal with the digital video signal, highly efficient coding
techniques which compress such a digital video signal have
been generally employed. One example of such a highly
efficient coding technique is known as Adaptive Dynamic
Range Coding (ADRC).The ADRC technique is an highly efficient coding
technique which obtains a dynamic range defined by a
maximum value and a minimum value of a plurality of pixels
contained in a two-dimensional block of a signal and then
encodes the signal corresponding to the dynamic range, as
disclosed in US Patent No. US-A-4 703 352.The encoded output of an ADRC process is constructed
of data called important word and quantized data of each 
pixel. The important word consists of a dynamic range DR
and a minimum value MIN. If an error should occur in the
important word, the error would propagate to all pixels of
the block. Thus, this data is called the important word.
With respect to errors of quantized data, since the ADRC
process does not compress image data in space direction,
even if an error occurs in quantized data upon
transmitting, the error does not propagate to decoded data
of other pixels. Thus, if a pixel with an error were
interpolated with pixel data adjacent thereto, the error
would become unremarkable. Such an interpolating process
is referred to as a concealing process.In the conventional pixel-by-pixel concealing
technique, a pixel with an error is substituted with the
average value of the adjacent pixels or a pixel value
adjacent thereto. Thus, the resolution is deteriorated at
the pixel with the error.Even if visual deterioration is zero or small, when
multiple-dubbing where dubbing is repeated is performed,
the image quality of the restored image may be deteriorated
since a decoded value is largely apart from a real decoded
value. According to the invention, there
is provided an apparatus for concealing error data of
pixel data in a received digital image signal, comprising:
receiving means for receiving the digital image
signal;deframing means for detecting errors every
predetermined unit to

predetermined unit to generate a first error flag in high

order bit planes including at least the most significant
bit plane of bit planes of pixel data in said received

digital image signal and for forming a second error flag
representing presence or absence of an error in each of

bits forming said pixel data every pixel data in said high
order bit planes on the basis of said first error flag; and
error correcting means (17) for calculating (22,23) a
plurality of possible data values of said pixel data and

for selecting (24) one data value from among said plurality

(H, 11) is constructed by arranging each bit for each of a
plurality of said bit planes comprising a plurality of 

said pixel data and wherein a plurality of bits of said
pixel data comprising a unit of said error detection in

each of said bit planes include said plurality of bits
comprising pixel data at positions spaced apart one

another.
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said error
correcting means (17) selects one data value from among

said plurality of data values which are calculated by
using two pixel data horizontally adjacent to said pixel

data with an error as surrounding pixel data of said pixel
data with an error, taking the correlation between said

pixel data with an error and said two pixel data adjacent
thereto into consideration.
