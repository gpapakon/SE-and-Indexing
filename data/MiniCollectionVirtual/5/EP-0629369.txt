<ABSTRACT>
The flexible cushion particularly for armchairs, 
couches and pieces of furniture in general comprises a 

substantially flat-shaped body (2,3,4) made of flexible 
foamed plastic material. The body (2,3,4) forms an internal 

cavity (10) which accommodates an elastic block (20) 
constituted by a plurality of metal wire springs arranged 

side by side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible cushion 
particularly for armchairs, couches and pieces of furniture 
in general. As is known, cushions for armchairs, couches and 
pieces of furniture in general are often manufactured by 
using blocks of foamed material which are shaped so as to 
give the cushion the intended shape. This embodiment gives the advantage of obtaining 
relatively stable shapes for the cushion, following the 
intended profiles, but on the other hand an elastic 
response is obtained which does not allow to achieve a 
springiness, for the cushion, comparable with old-style 
cushions obtained by means of a padding with mutually tied 
springs. In an attempt to improve springiness characteristics, 
other known solutions use an internal body constituted by 
flexible blocks formed by arranging side by side several 
metal wire springs individually placed inside bags, which 
allow to obtain a region of springiness with conventional 
springs; the springy block is then covered with a layer of 
cotton wool, feather, wool or the like to produce the 
desired continuity on the outer surface. Although this kind of solution has better springiness 
characteristics than cushions entirely made of foamed 
plastic material, it has the drawback that it does not 
allow to precisely obtain the intended profiles, since 
unavoidably the outer covering layer of cotton wool,  
 
feather and the like produces rounded areas at the corners 
and in any case does not allow to produce profiles of 
particular shapes. An aim of the present invention is to solve the above 
described problem by providing a flexible cushion which 
allows to have the easy shaping possibilities of cushions 
made of foamed plastic material although it has the 
springiness characteristics typical of cushions provided 
with internal springs. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
flexible cushion which can be shaped as desired according 
to the preferred profile without thereby encountering 
production problems. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a flexible cushion which, by virtue of its particular 
constructive characteristics, gives the greatest assurances 
of reliability and safety in use. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a flexible cushion that can be easily obtained starting 
from commonly commercially available elements and materials 
and is furthermore competitive from a merely economical 
point of view. With this and other objects in view, there is 
provided, according to the
