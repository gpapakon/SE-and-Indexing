<ABSTRACT>
For a sensor (1) having a two-part, especially rod-shaped housing, is proposed to produce both housing parts, a protective shell (3) and a cable holder (2), of the same plastic by injection moulding and to connect the two housing parts by means of a cylindrical snap-in connection (15, 16). A single curable casting compound (14), which is dosed in such a manner that it only partially fills the protective shell (3), is used for fixing the function elements (23, 27, 28) of the sensor (1) in location and for sealing the snap-in connection (15, 16) and the line feed-throughs. To wet all points to be sealed, particularly the snap-in connection (15, 16), with casting compound, during the assembly process the sensor (1) accommodated in a device is briefly turned and tilted back again before the curing process.

<CLAIMS>
Measurement transducer having a two-part, in
particular bar-shaped, housing, of which one housing part

(3) is constructed as a substantially cylindrical
protective sleeve and of which the other housing part (2)

is constructed as a cable holder or plug socket as well as
a carrier for the functional elements of the measurement

transducer, the actual sensor (28) of which housing parts
is arranged in the immediate vicinity of the end wall of

the protective sleeve after the housing parts have been
joined together,

characterised

in that both housing parts are constructed as plastic
injection-moulded parts,
in that means of a cylindrical snap connection (15, 16) are
moulded onto the housing parts,
in that a partition wall (17) is formed on the plug socket
or cable holder (2) transversely to the transducer axis and

has openings for feeding through contacts or leads (20),
and
in that a single curable casting compound (14, 34) is
employed to fix the functional elements (23, 27, 28) and to

seal off the lead or contact feedthroughs and the snap
connection (15, 16).
Method for assembling a bar-shaped measurement
transducer according to Claim 1,

characterised

in that the protective sleeve (3) located in a device (11,
12) is partially filled with the casting compound (14),
in that the preassembled cable holder (2) or plug socket is
introduced into the protective sleeve (3) and the snap-connection

means (15, 16) are brought into engagement,
in that the measurement transducer (1) is turned through
180Â° in the axial plane and turned back after a certain

time, 
in that a space (pot 19), which is formed on the cable
holder (2) or plug socket and serves for the distribution

of the leads (20) or the introduction of a plug, is filled
to a greater or lesser extent with casting compound (34),

and
in that the measurement transducer (1) is subjected to a
heat treatment for the curing of the casting compound (14,

34).
Method according to Claim 2,

characterised

in that a membrane (33) formed in the partition wall (17)
is pierced after the curing process,
in that the space (18) between the partition wall (17) and
the protective sleeve (3) is put under pressure and is

tested for leaktightness, and
in that the point which has been pierced is sealed off by
means of a pin.
