<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS TO CONVERT A REFRIGERATED VENDOR TO A REFRIGERATED DISPLAY CASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a refrigerated cabinet for storing beverage containers and other food items, and more particularly, to a cabinet for housing a plurality of readily interchangeable and independent modular elements which collectively define a refrigeration cabinet having multiple uses.Beverage containers are displayed and sold in a variety of different types of refrigerated self-serve display cabinets and coin-operated vending machines. The sales environment in which the machine will be used most times determines the necessary attributes of a particular refrigerated cabinet. For example, a glass door merchandiser may be chosen to sell items inside a business, but would not be practical for vending items outside the business where a closed coin-operated merchandiser would be a better choice.However, conventional refrigerated cabinets are not easily convertible from one type of merchandiser to another. For example, if a vendor purchases a closed vending machine but later discovers the need for a display type refrigerated cabinet, there is presently no way of economically and conveniently converting that machine. This is due in part to differences in the refrigeration systems provided by the two diverse types 

 of vendors. This inability to convert merchandisers prohibits vendors from utilizing more effective methods for selling a product. Further, a vendor's purchase of a plurality of different types of cabinets causes expense and inventory problems.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is a primary object of this invention to provide a modular refrigeration apparatus with a cabinet having a front opening and divided into refrigerated and unrefrigerated portions for housing a plurality of removable modular units, the removable modular units including one of a selected plurality of interchangeable storage units and substantially the same refrigeration unit for use with either storage unit. It is a further object of the invention to provide a modular refrigeration apparatus in which a plurality of interchangeable storage units and a refrigeration unit can be easily removed or inserted from within a cabinet without affecting the other units. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a modular refrigeration apparatus in which one of a plurality of interchangeable storage units includes a vending unit for storing and dispensing a plurality of containers having a front panel which attaches

5. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said refrigeration means includes: condenser means for circulating a refrigerant through a plurality of coils, said condenser means including a condenser fan for exhausting warm air to the outside of said cabinet through a condenser exhaust channel, the air being exhausted along one side of said condenser exhaust channel creating an aspiration effect thereby drawing air from outside said cabinet for cooling a compressor disposed in a side of the exhaust channel opposite from said one side; and evaporator means, connected to said condenser for cooling and removing moisture from the air flowing within said cabinet.
6. A modular refrigeration apparatus, comprising: a cabinet having a front opening for separately receiving a plurality of removable modular units, said removable modular units including one of a selected plurality of interchangeable storage units and a refrigeration unit, said plurality of interchangeable storage units comprising: a vending unit for storing and dispensing a plurality of containers, the vending unit including: a front panel attached to the front opening of said cabinet for sealing the interior of said cabinet, a plurality of storage columns for holding said containers to be dispensed,
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


 product selection means positioned on the front panel for choosing the type of stored container to be dispensed, and vending mechanism means, responsive to said product selection means, for causing a selected container to be released from a selected one of said storage columns and ejected through an aperture in said front panel, and a display unit for storing a plurality of containers, the display unit including, a front panel attached to the front opening for sealing the interior of said cabinet, said front panel having a transparent panel door pivotally mounted to said front panel, and a partition positioned adjacent and parallel to the rear interior wall of said cabinet creating an air flow channel therebetween, said partition having a plurality of slots for facilitating a circular flow of a plurality of cool air currents in predetermined directions from said refrigeration unit in the interior of said cabinet; whereby said interchangeable storage units and said refrigeration unit can be respectively removed or inserted from within said cabinet.
7. The apparatus as recited in claim 6, said partition further comprising a plurality of air directors, each of said air directors being positioned adjacent a corresponding one of said slots for directing a portion of the air flow from said air distribution plenum to the interior of said cabinet and toward said front panel.
