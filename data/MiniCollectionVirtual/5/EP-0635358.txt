<ABSTRACT>
A laminate having improved polarization 
characteristics, in which an adhesive layer (4) is formed 

on one surface of a polarizing film, a retarded 
polarizing film or a retardation film (3) and a release 

film (6) having a transparent biaxially oriented aromatic 
polyester film as a base film is formed on the surface 

of the adhesive layer, said laminate being situated 

such that (1) a direction of an orientation main axis, 
as measured by a microwave transmission-type molecular 

orientation meter, of the biaxially oriented aromatic 
polyester film in the release film and (2) a direction 

of an orientation axis of the polarizing film, the 
retarded polarizing film or the retardation film are 

substantially the same or substantially form an angle 
of 90°. The laminate of this invention makes it easy 

to find foreign matters or defects by the visual 
inspection of the polarizing film, the retarded 

polarizing film or the retardation film of a large-sized 
TFT system or STN system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminate having
improved polarization characteristics, and a release
film which can be used therefor. More specifically,
the invention relates to a laminate having a structure
which can be obtained when
an adhesive layer is formed on one surface of a
polarizing film, a retarded polarizing film or a
retardation film and a release film is laminated on the
surface of the adhesive layer, the laminate having excellent
polarization characteristics and making it easy to
visually inspect foreign matters; and to a release film
which can be used therefor.In recent years, there has been advanced a
technology for a liquid crystal display (LCD) having
high performance and high image quality and being
colored and large-sized. Moreover, LCD can be lighter
in weight and lower in energy consumption than a
cathode ray tube (CRT). Accordingly, LCD has been
widely employed as a display for note-type personal
computers and word processors, and the use of LCD has
rapidly spread and grown remarkably.For further growth in the use of the liquid crystal
display (LCD), however, a rationalization of cost is
an important factor. Especially with a thin film
transistor (TFT, active matrix) system or a super
twist nematic (STN) system of a large size, the occurrence
of unacceptable products is great, and therefore a
reduction in cost by improving the yield is urgently
demanded.In the liquid crystal display (LCD), a
polarizing film, a retarded polarizing film and a
retardation film are necessary and important parts for
providing the density of a transmitted light and changing 
the color shade of the transmitted light in LDC. For
these films, stable maintenance of qualities is also
important, and criteria for inspections in the
production process, quality and shipment of products
have been increasingly more severe.The polarizing film, the retarded polarizing
film and the retardation film are each provided for LCD
by die- cutting to desired sizes a roll of a laminate that is
prepared by forming an adhesive layer on one surface of
a polarizing substrate and then laminating a release
film on the adhesive layer. One of
the important items in inspection of these films is an
inspection of the incorporation and adhesion of foreign
matters. The control of foreign matters is important
in all steps including not only the step of producing a
polarizing film but also the steps of adhesion-laminating
with a release film, die-cutting,
aging, shipment and packaging.However, inspection of foreign matters in the
final

A laminate having improved polarization
characteristics, in which an adhesive layer is formed on one

surface of the polarizing film, a retarded polarising film
or a retardation film and a release film having a

transparent biaxially oriented aromatic polyester film as
base film has its release surface in contact with the

adhesive layer, wherein the positioning of the polyester
film with respect to the polarizing film, the retarded

polarizing film or the retardation film is such that the
orientation main axis (as measured by a microwave

transmission-type molecular orientation meter) of the
polyester film is essentially parallel or substantially

perpendicular to the orientation axis of the polarizing
film, the retarded polarizing film or the retardation film,

and wherein the biaxially oriented aromatic polyester film
has an MOR value (the ratio of the maximum value to the

minimum value of transmission, both measured with a
molecular orientation meter respectively in the longitudinal

and in the transverse directions of stretching) of 1.3 to
1.8, and a retardation (R) value, as defined by the

following formula (1), of at least 1,200 nm.

R = Δn.d
wherein Δn is the difference (nx - ny) between
the refractive index (nx) in the width direction

and the refractive index (ny) in a direction at
right angles to the width direction of the film

in a visible light having a wavelength (λ) of
589 nm, and d is the thickness (nm) of the film.

oriented aromatic polyester film the difference between the

maximum value and the minimum value of the MOR is 0.2 or
less.

aromatic polyester film is a polyethylene terephthalate

film.
