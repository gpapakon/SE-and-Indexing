<ABSTRACT>
A passive infrared movement detector for a detection range of at least 180 DEG  comprises an infrared sensor (1) with mirror elements (2) and a Fresnel lens system in the form of a bent film (3) which forms, together with an electronic evaluation system, a structural unit on the printed circuit board (4). It is in this case essential for the invention that the infrared sensor is a two-element sensor (1) which has on mutually opposite sides in each case one infrared-sensitive surface (5) which covers the associated lateral region (6) directly and the front region (7) indirectly via a mirror (2) arranged on the two sides in front of the infrared-sensitive surfaces (5).

<CLAIMS>
A passive infra-red movement detector for an at least 180Â° capture range
in the horizontal direction, comprising an infra-red sensor (1) and two

mirror elements (2), a fresnel lens system in the form of a curved foil (3),
which together with evaluating electronics form a constructional entity on

a circuit board (4),

characterised in that the sensor is a two element sensor (1), which has
on each of its opposite sides an infra-red sensitive surface (5), which

capture heat rays (8) directly from the respective side regions (6) of the
detector and capture the heat rays from the frontal region (7) of the

detector indirectly via the mirrors (2) arranged on either side in front of
the infra-red sensitive surfaces (5).
A passive infra-red movement detector according to Claim 1,
characterised in that in the side region (6) of an infra-red sensor surface

(5) a heat ray (8), focused by a corresponding section A 1 of the curved
fresnel lens (3) in each case falls in a direct line onto the corresponding

infra-red sensitive surface (5), and that a focused heat ray (8), from a
section A 2 in the frontal region (7) of the fresnel lens (3) is redirected by

a mirror (2) corresponding with it, before it similarly falls onto the infra-red

sensitive surface (5) concerned.
A passive infra-red movement detector according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that due to the redirection of the heat ray (8) from the

frontal region (7) by the mirror (2), the separation of the fresnel lens (3)
from the circuit board (4) is kept small.
A passive infra-red movement detector according to Claim 3,
characterised in that, in spite of the reduced separation between the

fresnel lens (3) and the circuit board (4) in the frontal region, as a result 
of the redirection of the heat ray, the lens elements of the fresnel lens (3)

in the frontal region (7) have almost the same focal length as the lens
elements of the fresnel lens in the side region (6).
A passive infra-red movement detector according to one of the Claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the mirrors (2) arranged on either side of the

infra-red sensitive surfaces (5) have similar curvatures, whereby the heat
rays (8) arriving from different horizontal directions (H) via the fresnel

lenses (3) always reach the corresponding infra-red sensitive surface (5).
A passive infra-red movement detector according to one of the Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the two mirrors (2) are formed with large

surfaces, so that heat rays (8) from different vertical directions also
always reach the corresponding infra-red sensitive surface (5).
