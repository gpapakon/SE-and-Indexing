<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser includes a first one-conductive 
type clad layer (12), a first active layer (13), a second 

other-conductive 
type clad layer (14), a third one-conductive type clad 

layer (15a), a second active layer (16), and a fourth other-conductive 
type clad layer (17) stacked in sequence. Either the second 

other-conductive type clad layer or the third one-conductive 
type clad layer has a thickness smaller than the thickness 

of a depletion layer of the p-n junction grown at the 
boundary between the second other-conductive type clad layer 

and the third one-conductive type clad layer when voltage is 
applied across the first one-conductive type clad layer and 

the fourth other-conductive type clad layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser, 
and more specifically to a semiconductor laser having a 
plurality of unit structures stacked in sequence, each unit 
structure including an active layer sandwiched between clad 
layers. A typical semiconductor laser has a unit structure in 
which an active layer is sandwiched between clad layers. In order to obtain a stronger laser beam, a prior art 
technique has proposed to stack a plurality of such unit 
structures in sequence to form a semi semiconductor laser. FIG. 
5 shows a section of such a semiconductor laser having two 
unit structures stacked one on the other. In FIG. 5, the semiconductor laser comprises in 
sequence: 
an n-GaAs substrate 61 having a thickness of about 100 
µm and a carrier density of 1 to 3 x 1018 cm-3; a first n-Al0.5Ga0.5As clad layer 62 having a thickness 
of 1.0 to 1.5 µm and a carrier density of 0.5 to 1 x 1018 
cm-3; a first undoped GaAs active layer 63 having a thickness  
 
of 0.01 to 0.1 µm; a second p-Al0.5Ga0.5As clad layer 64 having a 
thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 µm and a carrier density of 0.5 to 1 
x 1018 cm-3; a third n-Al0.5Ga0.5As clad layer 65 having a thickness 
of 1.0 to 1.5 µm and a carrier density of 0.5 to 1 x 1018 
cm-3; a second undoped GaAs active layer 66 having a 
thickness of 0.01 to 0.1 µm; a fourth p-Al0.5Ga0.5As clad layer 67 having a 
thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 µm and a carrier density of 0.5 to 1 
x 1018 cm-3; and a p+GaAs contact layer 68 having a thickness of 0.3 to 
1.0 µm and a carrier density of 1 to 10 x 1018 cm-3. The semiconductor laser further comprises a p-side 
electrode 72 and an n-side electrode 71. The semiconductor laser as constructed above can 
radiate a stronger laser beam because of provision of the 
first active layer 63 and the second active layer 66 in a 
single semiconductor laser. When voltage is applied across the p-side electrode 72 
and the n-side electrode 71 in the above prior art 
semiconductor laser in such a manner that the p-side 
electrode 72 becomes at a positive potential with respect to 
the n-side electrode 71, the p-n junction formed at the  
 
boundary between the second p-type clad layer 64 and the 
third n-type clad layer 65 is biased in the reverse 
direction. Consequently, the breakdown voltage of the p-n 
junction becomes above 10 V, resulting in substantially 
increased power consumption. To avoid the reverse bias applied across the p-type 
layer 64 and the n-type layer 65, a prior art technique has 
been proposed in US-A-5212706 to grow a tunnel

other-conductive type clad layer (14, 14a), a third one-conductive 

type clad layer (15a, 15), a second active layer (16), and a fourth other-conductive

layer (15a, 15), formed when voltage is applied across said first one-conductive 

type clad layer (12) and said fourth other-conductive 
type clad layer (17), so that the voltage required for causing punch-through of the layer having said thickness is reduced.

or said third one-conductive type clad layer has a thickness 
less than 0.036 µm.
