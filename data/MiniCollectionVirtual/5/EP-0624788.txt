<ABSTRACT>
A parallel light beam is introduced from a 
collimator lens (30) into through holes defined in a honeycomb-shaped 

object (14), and any light emitted from the honeycomb-shaped 
object is read by a CCD camera (32) through a Fourier-transform 

lens (34) to produce a Fourier-transform image of the 
honeycomb-shaped object. The honeycomb-shaped object is 

tilted such that the axis of the through holes is inclined 
at a certain angle to the optical axis of the parallel laser 

beam. If the partitions contain interstices spaced at 
intervals and light introduced into the through holes passes 

through such interstices, the Fourier-transform image 
includes a stripe pattern induced by diffracted light from 

the interstices. Since the stripe pattern can easily be 
distinguished from a dot-matrix pattern representing light 

emitted from the through holes, the interstices contained in 
the partitions can reliably be detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and
an apparatus for inspecting a honeycomb-shaped object having
a plurality of small through holes defined therein, and more
particularly to a method of and an apparatus for inspecting
a honeycomb-shaped object made of ceramics to determine
whether there are interstices developed therein or not.Honeycomb-shaped objects made of ceramics having a
plurality of small through holes defined therein tend to
have interstices such as internal cracks or voids developed
in thin partitions defining the through holes when the
honeycomb-shaped objects are manufactured. The interstices
are caused to develop by the difference of contraction
between the peripheral portion and the inner portion of the
honeycomb-shaped object, as the object starts contracting
from the periphery thereof when the object is subjected to a
drying process or a sintering process after the object has
been formed. If an inspected honeycomb-shaped object is
found to have a number of interstices in excess of a predetermined
limit, it is discarded as being susceptible to
functional or durability problems.However, since the diameter of the through holes 
is very small and the partitions that define the through
holes are thin, it is highly difficult to confirm the
presence of any interstices in inner partitions through a
visual inspection process, though it is relatively easy to
visually confirm defective interstices in the vicinity of
both ends of the honeycomb-shaped object.According to a Japanese laid-open patent
publication No. 58-155343 and a United States Patent No.
4,319,840, there has been proposed a process of inspecting a
honeycomb-shaped object for any interstices therein by
applying a parallel light beam to the honeycomb-shaped object,
inclining the axis of the through holes in the honeycomb-shaped
object to the optical axis of the parallel light
beam through a certain angle to introduce the parallel light
beam into the through holes, and detecting any light beam
that has passed out of the through holes to determine
whether there are interstices in the honeycomb-shaped
object. More specifically, when the honeycomb-shaped object
is tilted through the angle, the light beam passing straight
through the through holes is interrupted, and any light beam
passing through interstices is projected onto a screen.
Therefore, it can be determined whether there are
interstices in the honeycomb-shaped object by confirming any
light beam projected onto the screen.However, a certain pattern is formed on the
