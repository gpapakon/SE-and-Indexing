<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer image-receiving sheet having (1) a 
support of (B) a base layer which is a biaxially stretched 

microporous film of a thermoplastic resin containing from 10 
to 45% by weight of an inorganic fine powder and (A) a 

surface layer which is a biaxially stretched film of a 
thermoplastic resin having a three-dimensional center-plane 

average roughness (SRa) of not more than 0.5 µm, surface 
layer (A) having a spatial average wavelength (Sλa), defined 

by the equation 

Sλa = 2πSRa/SΔa 
 
, where SRa is the three-dimensional 

center-plane average roughness and SΔa is the 
three-dimensional average slope, of not more than 100 µm and 

a gloss of not less than 93% as measured at 75° according to 
JIS P-8142 and (2) an image-receiving layer provided on the 

surface of the surface layer (A). The image-receiving sheet 
provides a clear image having high density, high gloss, and 

reduced rough feeling even using reduced printing energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer 
image-receiving sheet and more particularly to a thermal 
transfer image-receiving sheet on which a clear dye image 
having high density, high gloss and little rough feeling can 
be formed, even using reduced printing energy. Thermal transfer recording is generally carried out 
by heating a thermal transfer recording material, called an 
ink ribbon, which comprises a support having thereon a color 
forming layer containing a sublimable or vaporizable dye to 
sublimate or vaporize the dye and then transferring the dye 
to an image-receiving sheet to form a dye image. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 3, thermal 
transfer recording material 1 composed of support 4 and color 
forming layer 5 and image-receiving sheet 2 composed of 
thermal transfer image-receiving layer 6 and support 7 are 
brought into contact between drum 12 and electrically 
controlled heating source 3, and color forming layer 5 of 
transfer recording material 1 is heated by means of heat 
source 3, such as a thermal head, to sublimate or vaporize 
the dye contained in color forming layer 5. The sublimated 
or vaporized dye is thus transferred to image-receiving layer 
6 to achieve thermal transfer recording.  
 The material constituting image-receiving layer 6 
depends on the kind of the color former (dye) to be 
transferred thereto. For example, if one uses a heat-fusible 
color former, support 7 by itself can serve as an image-receiving 
layer. If one uses a sublimable disperse dye as a 
color former, a coated layer comprising a high polymer, such 
as polyester, may be used as an image-receiving layer. Support 7 of image-receiving sheet 2 typically will 
be a pulp paper, an opaque synthetic paper comprising a 
stretched film of a propylene-based resin containing an 
inorganic fine powder (see JP-B-46-40794 (corresponding to 
U.S. Patent 4,318,950), the term "JP-B" as used herein means 
an "examined published Japanese patent application"), or a 
coated synthetic paper prepared by coating a transparent 
polyethylene terephthalate or polyolefin film with a layer of 
a binder containing an inorganic compound, such as silica or 
calcium carbonate, to impart whiteness and dye-receptivity. Considering the after-use properties of an image-receiving 
sheet with a transferred dye image with respect to, 
for example, suitability for copying, writability with a 
pencil, and record preservability, a synthetic paper 
comprising a microvoid-containing stretched film of a 
polyolefin resin
