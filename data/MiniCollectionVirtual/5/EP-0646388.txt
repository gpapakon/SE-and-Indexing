<ABSTRACT>
Temporarily implantable electrode devices (14) intended for 
sensing electrical signals from living tissue are suitably 

devised so they contain an electrically insulating sheath 
(24) made of a resorbable material, and at least one non-toxic, 

liquid conductor (30, 32), arranged inside the insulating 
sheath (24) in order to form an electrical conductor 

which, via an electrode (20), can sense and carry 
electrical signals from living tissue to a medical apparatus. 

The resorbable material ultimately dissolves completely, 
the non-toxic, liquid conductor (30, 32) simultaneously 

mixing with other body fluids. This makes explantation 
unnecessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode device intended
to be at least partially implanted into living tissue,
comprising an electrically insulating sheath, an electrical
conductor arranged in the insulating sheath, an electrode
arranged on the insulating sheath for carrying electrical
signals between the living tissue and the electrical conductor
and a contact arranged at a proximal end of the insulating
sheath for carrying electrical signals between the
electrical conductor and a medical apparatus.One such electrode device is described in US-A-3,915,174.
The known electrode device can be implanted into a heart
either temporarily or permanently in order to stimulate the
heart and sense electrical heart signals. The electrode
device can be connected either to an extracorporeal apparatus
or to an implantable apparatus, such as a pacemaker.The utilization of temporary electrode devices for sensing
electrical signals in body tissue is very useful in conjunction
with e.g. diagnosis of illnesses and in determinations
of the most appropriate treatment for a patient. One such
determination could entail e.g. an investigation of whether
the patient should be provided with an implantable defibrillator.For reception of usable values in the monitoring of electrical
signals in living tissue, the electrode device must
be connected to the tissue in a reliable manner. There are
several different known ways to attach an electrode device
to tissue. Basically either an active means or a passive
means is used. When the electrode device is attached to the
tissue it will, after only a relatively short period of
time, become embedded in the tissue. As a result, the electrode 
device cannot readily be removed once the investigation
has been completed. Since the electrode device
becomes firmly embedded in tissue, the tissue could be damaged
when the electrode device is removed. Explanting a
temporary electrode device also requires surgery, as a rule,
thereby increasing the risk to the patient. One common
recourse for minimizing trauma to tissue and risks to the
patient is simply to leave the electrode device inside the
patient. However, this solution is not without risk either,
since the electrode device, if left behind in the body,
could irritate and even damage other tissue.In the case of pure mechanical implants, which are only
needed temporarily in the body of a patient, resorbable
materials are now being used to a large degree. The resorbable
material gradually dissolves in the body, ultimately
disappearing
