<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a
cationic electrodeposition coating composition which is free

of toxic rust-preventive pigments such as lead compounds and
capable of giving coating films having high resistance to

corrosion and rusting, even when applied to a substrate surface
which is only insufficiently subjected, to a chemical

conversion treatment.
The present invention provides a cationic

electrodeposition coating composition
which comprises a rust inhibitor comprising at least one

compound selected from the group consisting of compounds
containing any of elemental metals belonging to the period 4,

5 or 6 of group 3 of the periodic table and a sulfonium- and
propargyl group-containing resin composition.
For, example, the content of said rust inhibitor is 0.03
to 10 weight parts in terms of the elemental metal in the rust

inhibitor based on 100 weight parts of the solid resins in the
resin composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cationic
electrodeposition coating composition and more particularly to
a lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition
which can be applied to a substrate which has not been subjected
to a chemical conversion treatment or any local area of a
substrate that has not been sufficiently so pretreated to impart
a high resistance to corrosion and rusting.Electrodeposition coating compositions are excellent in
rust preventing effect, corrosion resistance and throwing power
and can form uniform coatings and, therefore, are widely used
on metallic shaped articles, especially as primers for
automotive bodies and parts. From the standpoint of corrosion
resistance and rust prevention, in particular, cationic
electrodeposition coating compositions have now been in use
almost universally.In cationic electrodeposition coating compositions, rust
inhibitor pigments, such as lead compounds, for example basic
lead silicate, have been used to attain high corrosion and
rusting resistance. In recent years, however, the use of lead
compounds has been restricted because of their toxicity which
causes an environmental pollution problem, among others.As rust inhibitor pigments other than lead compounds,
such pigments as phosphate, molybdate and borate pigments,
among others, have heretofore been evaluated. These, however,
have a drawback; they are inferior in rust preventing effect
when compared with lead compounds. As for other proposals,
Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-02-279773 discloses the use of
iron oxide, Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-04-325572 discloses
the use of copper, nickel, zinc, cobalt, chromium, aluminum,
manganese, zirconium, tin or iron, Japanese Kokai Publication 
Hei-05-140487 discloses the use of bismuth hydroxide/tin,
cerium hydroxide/tin or nickel hydroxide/tin, Japanese Kokai
Publication Hei-05-239386 discloses the use of lantanum
compounds, Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-05-247385 discloses
the use of bismuth compounds/tin and, further, Japanese Kokai
Publication Hei-06-220371 discloses the use of tungsten
compounds. In all these cases, however, the anticorrosive and
rust-preventing effects have been found inadequate.Moreover in order to achieve high corrosion resistance
and rust inhibition by the application of a cationic
electrodeposition coating, the metal substrate must be
subjected to a chemical conversion treatment, using zinc
phosphate, for instance, in advance. However, when the metal
substrate has a "bag"-like recessed structure, an effective
chemica
