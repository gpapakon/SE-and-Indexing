<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a circulating fluidized bed reactor including a lower region (3) equipped with a fluidization grid (11), with means for injecting primary air (12) below the grid (11), with means for injecting secondary air (13) above the grid (11) and with means for introducing fuel (10), the walls (5) surrounding this lower region being equipped with heat-exchange tubes, and an upper region (2) surrounded by walls (4) provided with heat-exchange tubes (9), the heat-exchange tubes (9) being joined together by fins (30). The walls of the said regions (2, 3) are equipped with vertical heat-exchange panels known as extensions (14) fixed perpendicularly to the walls (4, 5) of the regions (2, 3) these extensions being formed of tubes (15) internal to the reactor, of a horizontal width of between 150 and 500 mm and spaced apart by a distance of between 1.5 and 4 times their width, this width being defined as the distance between the internal face of the fins (30) of the walls (4, 5) and the furthermost generatrix of the furthermost tube of the extensions.

<CLAIMS>
A circulating fluidised bed reactor comprising a 
bottom zone (3) provided with a fluidising grid (11), means 

(12) for injecting primary air beneath the grid (11), means 
(13) for injecting secondary air above the grid (11), and fuel 

injection means (10), the walls (5) surrounding said bottom 
zone being provided with heat exchange tubes, and a top zone 

(2) surrounded by walls (4) provided with heat exchange tubes 
(9), characterised in that at least one wall of at least one 

of said zones (2, 3) is provided with vertical heat exchange 
panels (14) referred to as "extensions" that extend 

perpendicularly to the wall (4, 5) and that are made up of 
heat exchange tubes (15) inside the reactor, the horizontal 

width (1) of the extensions lying in the range 150 mm to 
500 mm, and the extensions being spaced apart from one another 

by a distance (D) lying in the range 1.5 times to 4 times 
their width. 
A reactor according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the heat exchange tubes (9) of the walls (4, 5) are 

interconnected by fins (30) and said width (1) is defined as 
the distance between the inside faces of the fins (30) of the 

walls (4, 5) and the most distant generator line of the tube 
(15A) of the most distant extensions. 
A reactor according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the extensions are welded continuously to the wall (4, 5) of 

the zone (2, 3). 
A reactor according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the extensions (14) are offset from the wall (4, 5) by a 

distance (d) of less than 60 mm, said distance being the 
distance between the inside faces of the fins (30) of the 

walls and the nearest extension tube generator line (15B), the 
extensions being supported at least by their top portion. 
A reactor according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the extensions (14) are 

distributed around the inside perimeter of the reactor.  
 
A reactor according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the extensions (14) are situated 

along the full height of the reactor. 
A reactor according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the extensions (14) are disposed over 

the full height of the wall (4) of the top zone (2). 
A reactor according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the extensions (14) of the tubes 

(15) include auxiliary tubes (15C) connected to the free ends 
(14A) of the extensions (14) and fixed outside the planes of 

symmetry of the extensions (14). 
A reactor according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that it includes at least one internal 

dense fluidised bed (22, 23) in communication with the inside 
of the reactor by its top portion and that receives solid 

matter falling down the walls (4) of the top zone (2) and 
returns at least a fraction thereof by allowing it to overflow 

towards the bottom zone (3) all along and over an overflow 
wall (28, 29), said internal bed (22, 23) being fitted with 

heat exchange tubes having their bottom portions connected to 
a feed inlet and having their top portions connected to 

an outlet, and the tubes (15) of the extensions (14) are 
used as outlet tubes for the tubes fitted to the internal 

bed (22, 23).
