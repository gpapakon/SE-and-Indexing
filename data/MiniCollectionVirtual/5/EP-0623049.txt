<ABSTRACT>
Inorganic unit for filtering a liquid medium (2) in order to recover a filtrate. The unit comprises at least one rigid porous inorganic structure (A), including first (a1) and second (a2) main surfaces located opposite one another, at least one cavity (4) formed in the structure and spaced from the two surfaces by delimiting bearing portions (6), the cavity or main structures being covered by at least one separating layer (3). According to the invention, the porous structure (A) includes at least one channel (8) with impermeable walls opening onto both surfaces (a1, a2) and formed to pass through a bearing portion (6), in order to constitute a first flow network impermeable in relation to the cavity (4).

Inorganic filtration unit for a liquid medium (2) with a view to
recovering a filtrate, the unit comprising at least one inorganic, rigid, porous

structure (A, B, C), interposed between an end element (E) and an end
counter-element (E'), each porous structure presenting first (a
1
) and
second (a
2
) principal faces opposite each other, and comprising one cavity
(4) arranged in the structure at a distance from the two faces, defining

bearings (6, 6
1
) that ensure a continuity of matter between the opposite
faces, the cavity or the principal faces being coated with at least one

separating layer (3),

   characterised in that the cavity (4) is confined within the porous
structure by being defined by at least one bearing (6
1
) forming a peripheral
border, the cavity (4) opening out via at least one conduit (12) with tight

walls on at least one of the principal faces, and in that the porous structure
(A, B, C) comprises at least one channel (8) with tight walls opening out on

the two faces (a
1
, a
2
) and arranged to traverse a bearing (6, 6
1
) with a view
to constituting a first circulation network (R
1
) tight with respect to the cavity
(4).
Unit according to claim 1, characterised in that:

it comprises at least one complementary, porous, rigid and inorganic
structure (B) assembled on one of the faces of the porous structure (A)

so as to define by their faces in register, a circulation chamber (10)
connected to the first network (R
1
) and defined by at least one peripheral
reinforcement (11) forming a continuity of matter between the structures

(A, B),
the conduit (12) with tight walls achieved for the purpose of
communicating with the cavity (4) traverses right through the

complementary structure via reinforcements (11) to constitute a second
circulation network (R
2
), tight with respect to the first network (R
1
).
Unit according to claim 1, characterised in that the porous
structure (A) is associated on at least one of its faces, with at least one

identical complementary porous structure (B, C), defining by its face in
register with that of the porous structure, a circulation chamber (10)

connected to the first network (R
1
), this complementary porous structure (B,
C) being provided, on the one hand, with at least one channel (8) with tight

walls arranged to open out on the two faces of the complementary porous 
structure, being connected to the first circulation network (R
1
) and, on the
other hand, with at least one cavity (4) arranged at a distance from the two

opposite faces of the complementary porous structure and communicating
via the conduit (12) with tight walls with the cavity (4) of the adjacent porous

structure in order to constitute a second circulation network (R
2
), tight with
respect to the first network (R
1
).
Unit according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it is
constituted by a stack of inorganic, rigid, porous structures (A, B, C) as

previously defined that are interposed between the thrust (E) and counter-thrust
(E') elements.
Unit according to claim 4 dependent on calm 2 or 3,
characterised in that the thrust (E) and counter-thrust (E') elements are

fixed in tight manner on the bearings (6) or reinforcements (11) and are
arranged to comprise pipes (13) for admission and return of the liquid

medium to be treated, connected to the first circulation network (R
1
) and at
least one pipe (14) for recovering the filtrate, connected to the second

circulation network (R
2
).
Unit according to claim 5, characterised in that the thrust (E)
and counter-thrust (E') elements are each constituted by an inorganic rigid

plate comprising said tight pipes (13, 14).
Unit according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
each porous structure (A, B, C) comprises at least one bearing (6) or

reinforcement (11), of punctual nature, defining respectively the cavity (4)
and the chamber (10) and performing a function of mechanical strength.
Unit according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
each porous structure (A, B, C) is formed by two plates (A
1
, A
2
).
Unit according to claim 5, characterised in that each porous
structure (A, B, C) is formed by two plates made in a symmetrical manner.
Unit according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
walls of the channels (8) and of the conduits (12) are rendered tight with the

aid of a suitable product or an added non-porous element.
