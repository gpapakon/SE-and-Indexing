<ABSTRACT>
A pressure pulse wave sensor (10) for detecting a pressure 
pulse wave produced from an arterial vessel of a living 

subject in synchronism with heartbeat of the subject, the 
sensor having a press surface (54) adapted to be pressed on 

a body surface (16) of the subject, a protruding portion 
protruding from the press surface and having a top surface 

(30), and at least one pressure sensing element (32) 
provided in the top surface of the protruding portion, for 

detecting the pressure pulse wave produced from the arterial 
vessel, the top surface of the protruding portion being 

covered with a resilient protective layer (78), the pulse 
wave sensor further comprising a hard member (58, 98) which 

surrounds the protruding portion such that a top end of the 
hard member is substantially flush with the resilient 

protective layer covering the top surface of the protruding 
portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pulse wave
sensor
according to the preamble of claim 1 which is
adapted to be pressed on a body surface of a living
subject for detecting a pressure pulse wave produced from an
artery of the subject.There is known a pulse wave sensor having a press
surface adapted to be pressed on a body surface of a living
subject, a protruding portion protruding from the press
surface, and sensing means provided in a top surface of the
protruding portion, for detecting a pressure pulse wave
produced from an artery of the subject. As disclosed in U.S.
Pat. No. 5,179,956 assigned to the Assignee of the present
application and Laid-open Publication No. 4-67839 of
unexamined Japanese Patent Application, the pulse wave
sensor as described above has a resilient protective layer
formed of an epoxy resin, silicone resin or silicone rubber.
More specifically described, the resilient protective layer
covers the press surface of the protruding portion adapted
to be pressed on the body surface and additionally forms
inclined surfaces between the protruding portion and a
protection plate, which surfaces are inclined from the press
surface of the protruding portion toward the protection 
plate. This resilient protective layer is provided for the
purpose of protecting one or more pressure sensing elements
provided in the top surface of the protruding portion and a
cable connected thereto, as well as mitigating pain as felt
by the subject when the edges and/or corners of the
protruding portion are pressed on a skin (i.e., body
surface) of the subject for detecting the pulse wave. In
measuring blood pressure of the subject by using this pulse
wave sensor, the protruding portion of the pulse wave sensor
is pressed on the body surface over an artery such as a
radial artery from which the pulse wave is detected, such
that the artery partially becomes flattened. As a result,
pressure transmitted from the artery is detected by the
pressure sensing elements of the pulse wave sensor.In many cases, however, hard bone and tendon are
present near the artery from which the pressure pulse wave
is to be detected. When the pulse wave sensor is pressed on
the body surface with a pressing force necessary to measure
the blood pressure, the resilient protective layer which
surrounds the protruding portion receives relatively large
pressure from the bone and tendon, and tensile force caused
by friction between the protruding portion of the pulse wave
sensor and the skin of the subject on which the pulse wave
sensor is
