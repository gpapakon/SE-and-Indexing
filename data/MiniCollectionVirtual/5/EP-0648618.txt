<ABSTRACT>
A coin press serves for stamping coins from one-metal or bimetal rounds. The stamping tool is exchangeable. Together with the stamping tool, an ejector rod (8) takes effect by means of a path-controllable ejector lever (4). Instead of the ejector necessary during stamping, when a perforating tool according to the invention is used a stay device (19) is to be employed for operating a resilient holding-down device. The resilient holding-down device in the perforating tool is loaded via the pressure rod (8). At the same time, the ejector lever (4) together with the pressure roller (13) is lifted off from the pressure plate (14) of the ejector rod (8) so as to be out of action on the ejector rod (8), as shown at (29).

<CLAIMS>
Coin press for stamping round, and also 
polygonal, coins, medals and similar flat stamped 

parts (18) from one-metal, two-metal, and the like, 
circular blanks or starting components, having an 

exchangeable stamping tool (15) with a stamp (16) and 
stamping ring (17), and an ejector device (7) with an 

ejector rod (8), which can be acted on by a ram-driven 
ejector lever (4), the end (11) of which lever which is 

remote from the ram coupling side (10) is coupled to the 
moving part (12) of a frame-side pressure cylinder (5), 

characterized in that, for the purpose of piercing 
starting components, a piercing tool (26), with a 

resilient blank holder (27) for the starting component 
which is to be clamped between blank holder (27) and 

piercing die (28), can be inserted into the coin press, 
and in that a pressure-exerting device (19) for acting 

resiliently on the blank holder (27) is arranged on the 
coin press or is integrated in the latter, which 

pressure-exerting device acts on the blank holder (27) 
via the ejector rod (8), while the ejector lever (4) is 

disconnected from the ejector rod (8) by the action of 
the frame-side pressure cylinder (5). 
Coin press according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that pressure-exerting device (19) and ejector device (7) 

are arranged on the coin press so as to be functionally 
parallel and can be brought into a state of operational 

readiness reciprocally.
