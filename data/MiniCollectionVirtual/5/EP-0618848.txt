 IMPROVED GASKET FOR AN AEROSOL MOUNTING CUPBackgroundAerosol dispensing containers have found widespread use in the packaging of fluid materials including a variety of both liquid and powdered particulate products. Such containers are provided with a valve-controlled discharge orifice and operate by the action of a volatile propellant which is confined within the container together with the product to be dispensed. Because the propellant has an appreciable vapor pressure at room temperature, the product in the closed container is maintained under superatmospheric pressure.A typical aerosol unit comprises a hollow cylindrical container which is tightly closed at one end and is provided with an opening at its opposite end for receiving a dispensing valve assembly. A closure, commonly referred to as a mounting cup, serves as the closure for the container and as a support for the valve assembly. Typically, the mounting cup comprises a pedestal portion for mounting the valve unit, a panel portion extending from the pedestal portion, a skirt portion depending from the periphery of the panel, and an annular channel portion extending outwardly from the skirt. When the mounting cup is placed in sealing position on the container, the channel is positioned over the bead surrounding the container opening and the lower portion of the skirt adjacent to the channel is flared or clinched outwardly against the underside of the bead. To 

 ensure adequate sealing between the closure and the container, the cup is provided with a gasket in the channel, or predominantly in the channel, of the cup.In United States Patent Nos. 4,546,525 ("the '525 patent") and 4,547,948 ("the '948 patent"), a novel gasketed mounting cup system, including novel method and apparatus, is described wherein the gasket material is disposed on the mounting cup in the preferred position for effecting a seal between the mounting cup and the bead of the container, in an exceptionally rapid and efficient manner to form gasketed-mounting cups having excellent sealing characteristics. In general, the method of invention of the '525 and '948 patents comprises passing a tubular sleeve of gasket material onto a compressible mandrel; initially positioning and aligning the skirt of the mounting cup and the contiguous end of the mandrel such that the sleeve of gasket material may pass onto the skirt, said mandrel having fixed and moveable portions with respect to each' other and to their movement toward and away from the mounting cup; urging the moveable
