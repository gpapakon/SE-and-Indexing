<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radiation 
sensitive resin composition, and more particularly, to a 
radiation sensitive resin composition suitable as a 
negative type resist for preparing an integrated circuit 
sensitive to radiations such as ultraviolet rays, deep 
ultraviolet rays, X rays, electron beams, molecular 
beams, γ rays, synchrotron radiations, proton beams and 
the like. In the field of fine processing, a representative 
of which is the production of an integrated 
circuit element, a lithographic process enabling fine 
processing of 0.5 µm or less is now being developed in 
order to obtain a higher integration degree. Simultaneously 
therewith, there has recently been increased the 
demand of a resist excellent in thermal resistance, 
resistance to ion beams and the like which resist is 
used in the form of a thick film in a high-energy ion 
implantation processing. Conventional typical resists which have been 
used in the lithographic process are negative type 
resists using a cyclized rubber and a bisazide compound 
and positive type resists using a novolak resin and a 
quinonediazide compound. However, the performance of each of the above  
 
resists approaches its limit, and a difficulty 
accompanies the use of the resist in the fine processing 
of 0.5 µm or less. For example, in the negative type resist, fine 
patterns contact one another owing to the swelling of 
the resist during development. Also, when the positive 
type resist is irradiated with deep ultraviolet rays, 
the absorption of the rays by the resist is too strong 
and the sectional shape of the pattern becomes a 
triangle. When the positive type resist is irradiated 
with a high energy radiation such as electron beam or X 
rays the resist is cured to be converted into a negative 
type. Accordingly, it has been difficult to obtain a 
suitable fine pattern. Also, all the above resists have low thermal 
resistance at high temperatures of 150°C or more and are 
not suitable for use in the high-energy ion implantation 
processing. From EP-A-O 458 325, a composition consisting 
of a novolak, a crosslinking agent and a triazine has 
been known; however, when this composition is used, a 
resolution sufficient for fine processing is not 
obtained. Neither is a good pattern obtained in such a 
film thickness as to be used in the high-energy ion 
implantation processing.  
 An object of this invention is to provide a 
radiation sensitive resin composition which has a good 
sensitivity in such a wavelength range as g ray
