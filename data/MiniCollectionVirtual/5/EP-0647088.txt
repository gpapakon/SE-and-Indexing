<ABSTRACT>
Electrical connectors (10-15) including a row of conductive 
interconnect elements in the form of slugs (52) which extend 

through openings in a block of insulating material (30) and 
which are associated with resilient wadded elements (54) to 

connect conductive pads of circuit boards (17-20). A wall 
portion (49,50) of conductive material is positioned in 

parallel relation to the row of elements to provide a ground 
plane and an air dielectric (86) is provided along the length 

of each element to cooperate with the dielectric of the block 
and obtain a desired characteristic impedance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector according
to the preamble of claim 1 and more particularly to
electrical connectors which are usable for installation
between circuit boards or other components for propagation of
high frequency signals as well as electrical power
therebetween. The connectors of the invention are readily
installed and are highly efficient and reliable, while being
readily and economically manufacturable.An electrical connector of the general type indicated in the
preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A- 4 574 331. This
document discloses a combination of three layers, namely two
button boards and one feed-through spacer for each electrical
connection between two adjacent circuit boards. In the known
connector the buttons are wadded resilient contact elements
arranged in their associated openings in the button boards.Generally, many different types of electrical connectors have
heretofore been used or proposed in the prior art, including
electrical connectors which utilize wadded conductor contacts
or buttons which generally include "wads" of fine wire which
are placed in holes in a carrier of insulating material in
position to be compressed between the surfaces of a pair of
conductors to be connected. Such conductive wads are
advantageous in that they have very low resistance to current
and also in that they have very low inductance and are
otherwise advantageous for propagation of very high frequency
signals. However, arrangements of the prior art have left something to
be desired, particularly with respect to signal transmission
characteristics and with respect to providing low-loss,
efficient and reliable transmission of signals between
circuit boards.This invention was evolved with the general object of
improving upon the prior art and more particularly for
providing connectors which have optimal electrical
characteristics particularly with respect to efficient and
reliable propagation of high frequency signals between
circuit boards or the like.This object according to the present invention is
accomplished by means of an electrical connector according to
the preamble of claim 1 and being characterized by the
features of the characterizing clause of claim 1.Simultaneously, the invention aims at the provision of
connectors which can be readily used for low-loss
transmission of signals between separated circuit boards or
other components, while being efficient and reliable and
manufacturable at reasonably low cost.Thus, in a connector constructed in accordance with
