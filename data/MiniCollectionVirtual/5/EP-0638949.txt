<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid polymeric 
electrolyte, to the process for preparing it and to its 
use in the electrochemical devices which contain it. The solid polymeric electrolytes, also said 
"ionically conductive polymers" consist of a solid 
solution of an ionic compound, preferably an alkali 
metal salt, in a solid polymeric matrix deriving from 
the polymerization of monomers containing a heteroatom, 
such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur. The most widely diffused solid polymeric 
electrolyte are those based on a polyethylene oxide, 
or on another polyether, such as, for example, those 
disclosed in U.S. 4,471,037; FR 2,523,769; 
FR 2,568,574; EP 13,037 and EP 13,199. Such materials display useful values of ionic 
conductivity only at higher temperatures than room 
temperature and furthermore display unsatisfactory 
mechanical properties which cause a poor dimensional 
stability of the corresponding membranes. In U.S. Patent No. 5,173,205 and 
IT 1,222,929 particular polymeric polyvinyl ether-based 
electrolytes are disclosed which display both an 
improved mechanical strength and a satisfactory 
conductivity even at relatively low temperatures. Preparing such materials requires complex 
multistep processes comprising the copolymerization of 
suitable vinyl ethers at a temperature of the order of 
-75/-80°C for a time comprised within the range of from 
30 to 60 minutes, dissolving the resulting solid,  
 
crosslinked polyvinylether in a suitable solvent, 
blending the polymer with a solution containing an 
ionic compound and evaporating the solvent in order to 
obtain a membrane. In U.S. Patent No. 5,173,205 , 
crosslinking the suitably functionalized polyvinyl 
ether is carried out by means of a diprotic crosslinker 
agent during the step of polymer blending with the 
ionic compound. This step is followed by solvent 
evaporation in order to obtain the membrane. We have found now a solid, polymeric, polyether-based 
electrolyte which can be directly prepared in the 
membrane producing step by means of free-radical 
photopolymerization and which, as compared to the 
materials disclosed in the prior art, supplies a better 
performance as regards conductivity and mechanical 
strength. Therefore, the subject-matter of the present 
invention is a solid, polymeric electrolyte, obtainable 
in membrane form, comprising a solid solution of an 
ionic compound in a solid, crosslinked polymeric matrix 
of polyether nature, characterized in that said 
electrolyte is prepared by: 
1) blending:
