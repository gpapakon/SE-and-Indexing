<ABSTRACT>
With reference to Figure 1, a method of constructing a tray assembly 
results in a demountable tray assembly 1 which comprises three 

juxtaposed stacks of vertically-spaced trays 2, opposite ends of which 
are supported by upright structures 3 carrying tray support members 4 

which extend beneath the trays 2. The assembly 1 is provided with 
retaining means 5 operable to releasably retain the trays in place, on 

the tray support members 4. 
Each of the three stacks of trays comprises six superimposed trays 2, 
so that the assembly 1 comprises eighteen trays. The end portions of 

the trays are formed with cut-away portions 6. 
The tray support structures 3 each comprise a frame formed by two 
upstanding, laterally-spaced pillars 10 which are interconnected by 

the tray support members 4. 
The tray retaining means 5 comprise two sets of vertically spaced tray 
retraining members 15 mounted on a sub-frame 16 so as to be movable 

towards and away from the tray support members 4. In operation, the 
tray retaining members 15 are received by the cut-away portions 6. 

When the retaining members 15 are moved down, substantially 
vertically, so that they are contiguous with the tray support members 

4, and received by the cut-away portions 6, movement of the trays 2 
relative to the members 15 and 4 is limited, so that the trays are 

effectively retained in place. 
To allow release of the trays 2, the sub-frame 16 is moved upwardly, 
so that the retaining members 15 are moved away from the tray support 

members 4, in a substantially vertical direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tray assemblies which are particularly, but 
not exclusively, for use in conveying food products through controlled 
environments. As used herein, the term 'tray' is not limited to a structure having a 
flat support surface with a raised edge, and includes other forms of 
support structures. For example, box-shaped structures. Freezer tunnels for use with food products have traditionally employed 
trays mounted on a conveyor chain which passes through a controlled 
temperature environment in a continuous spiral path. The shape of the 
spiral has taken a number of forms in order to make the best use of 
the volumetric space available. However, all configurations require sufficient space to enable the 
trays to be turned in the spiral path. A favoured configuration 
combines the use of long straight sections with 180 degree turns so as 
to form a zig-zag. When the trays are subjected to such turns there 
is a speed limitation imposed by the need to retain the food products 
in stable positions on the trays while under centrifugal forces. For 
most ice-cream products it is necessary for the product to rest on 
plain, ie flat surfaced, trays. The use of webbed or friction 
surfaces would cause the products to permanently adhere to the tray 
surface. These factors combine to effectively limit the throughput of 
such freezer tunnels to a maximum of 450 product pieces per minute. The traditional designs of spiral freezer tunnels require the conveyor 
belt or chain to travel through the controlled environment. 
Additionally, the trays are usually driven by the conveyor at one 
side, with the supported ends on a runner. This design usually 
requires the trays to be securely fixed to the conveyor chain, which 
causes problems of friction, planar rotation of the trays, restriction 
of tray size and spacing, and difficulties with lubrication and with  
 
hygiene conditions. According to the invention, a method of constructing a tray assembly 
comprises the steps of forming a stack of vertically-spaced trays, 
supporting opposite ends of the trays by upright structures carrying 
tray support members and employing retaining means to releasably 
retain the trays in place on the support members. A tray assembly for use with said method may comprise at least one 
stack of vertically spaced trays, opposite ends of which are supported 
by upright structures carrying tray support members which extend 
beneath the trays, and retaining means operable to releasably retain 
the trays in place on the
