<ABSTRACT>
An integrated high voltage differential sensor which uses the inverse gain 
of a pair of parasitic JFETs to provide a low power circuit for translating a differential 

high voltage signal down to a lower voltage level that can be easily sensed by the low 
voltage control circuitry in a power IC and without the use of a resistive voltage 

divider. The IC includes, between a first high voltage input (11) and ground, a first 
series circuit of a first JFET (J1), a first voltage level shifting resistor (R1) and a bias 

current source (13). A second series circuit of a reference resistor (R
L
), a second JFET 
(J2), a second voltage level shifting resistor (R2) and a bias current source (15) is 

coupled between a second high voltage input (12) and ground. A feedback circuit 
including an operational amplifier (19) is coupled between a low voltage point of the 

first series circuit and the gates of both JFETs so as to adjust the bias voltages of the 
JFETs. A comparator (16) is coupled to a low voltage point of the second series circuit 

and switches about an input differential threshold value of I

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for sensing a differential high voltage
and more particularly to a power integrated circuit for sensing differential high voltage
signals.A common problem that exists in the field of integrated circuit technology
is that of sensing or monitoring high voltage signals, especially differential high voltage
signals, in view of the limited power handling capability of the integrated circuit (IC)
chip. It is conventional to use a resistive voltage divider to translate the high voltage
signals down to a lower level at which they can be conveniently processed by an IC
voltage sensor or monitor circuit. However, the use of a resistive voltage divider
entails several disadvantages which make this solution unattractive in many
technological applications. For example, a resistive voltage divider results in
considerable waste of power. This power increases with the square of the voltage, thus
making the overall circuit in which it is used less efficient. The resistive voltage
divider also uses a considerable area of the integrated circuit chip and thereby increases
the size of the IC chip. Especially in the case where it is desired to sense or monitor a
high differential voltage, for example, in the range of a few hundred volts. In this case,
two resistive voltage dividers would be needed, making it impractical to use in an
integrated circuit environment. European Patent Application EP-A-0 176 165 discloses a voltage difference
detector with a pair of current mirrors each formed by a first, diode connected,
transistor and a second transistor with matched resistors in their collector circuits. A
reference voltage is applied to the comonned emitter of two level sensing transistors
whose bases are respectively connected to the collectors of the second transistors of the
current mirrors.United States Patent US-A-5,113,092 discloses a differential voltage comparator
comprising a differential field effect transistor pair with commoned source electrodes
coupled to a bias current source and with their drain electrodes connected to a current
mirror.European Patent Application EP 0 292 270 discloses a voltage detection circuit
comprising a string of serially connected field effect transistors for detecting relatively
high voltages. A tap of the string is connected to a logic inverter gate composed of
MOS transistors.It is therefore an object of the present invention as claimed in claim 1 to provide a low power control
circuit that functions as a high voltage differential sensor.Another
