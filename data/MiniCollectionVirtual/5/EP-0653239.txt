<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drinking water machine
according to the preamble of claim 1.The main culprits of the water pollution today include industrial
wastes , household wastes, farm pesticides, and the animal wastes
produced by hog and poultry farms. As the pollution problems of the
source of our drinking water , such as the rivers, have become
increasingly worrisome, people tend to have a very little confidence
in the quality of their drinking water provided by the water company.
In addition, people's anxiety over the quality of their drinking
water is further aggravated by the fact that the conditions of the 
water-supplying pipes and reservoirs are often found to be
unsatisfactory. As a result, a variety of water-treating devices, such
as water filtering devices, water purifying devices, water softening
devices, etc., have become ubiquitous in places like offices, homes,
factories , schools churches , and so forth . In general , such
conventional water-treating devices as mentioned above are provided
with one or more additional filtration means for enhancing the purity
of the drinking water. The conventional drinking water machines are in
fact effective in upgrading the quality of the drinking water;
nevertheless the conventional drinking water machines are defective in
design. The shortcomings inherent in the conventional drinking water
machines are described explicitly hereinafter.The conventional drinking water machines are not provided with a PPM
(parts per million) device for monitoring the quality of the drinking
water so produced. It is therefore questionable that the drinking
water made by the conventional drinking water machines is really safe
to drink. Without the reliable scientific data indicating to the
effect that the drinking water produced by the conventional drinking
water machines is excellent in purity, people's anxiety over the
quality of their drinking water is not going to dissipate easily.Some of the conventional drinking water machines are provided with
the RO (reverse osmosis) filtration element, which is so arranged as to
form a parallel tangent plane with the flowing direction of the water.
As the water is forced under pressure against the RO filtration
element by means of a manually operated switch valve which is intended
to increase the speed and the flow of the water passing through the RO
filtration element, some of the water can be caused to pass through
the RO filtration element in a vertical angle instead of a parallel
manner, so as to filter out salts and
