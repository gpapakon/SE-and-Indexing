<ABSTRACT>
An alarm trigger is part of an anti-theft system which also includes a detector. The alarm trigger is integrated into a support by means of which it is secured to goods, preferably articles of clothing. A process is disclosed to keep the alarm trigger discrete and to prevent if from disturbing evaluation of the goods equipped therewith. According to this process, a continuous textile web is made from a fibrous material. The textile web has in each of its successive sections a functional textile strip specific to the goods, for example a woven label. Each section of the web is at least partially designed with two layers, so that a cavity is created in at least two partial steps. In the first partial step, only an initial area of the section of web is created with a still open pocket in its double-layered ares. Then the alarm trigger is introduced into the pocket through the pocket opening. Only then, in the second partial step, a pocket closure is created in an end area of the section of web, which completes the pocket and creates a closed cavity in which the alarm trigger is contained. The textile web provided with the alarm triggers is then cut into individual sections which form the finished combined units with alarm triggers.

A process for the textile production of a support provided with 
an alarm trigger (50) of an anti-theft system, 


wherein the support which is provided with the alarm trigger 
(50) can be mounted to articles, preferably articles of clothing (40) or 

leather articles
 
and the anti-theft system includes a detector which is arranged in the 

region of a passage for the goods and which responds to the alarm trigger 
(50) moving therepast 
by a continuous textile web (10) being produced from yarn 
material (31, 32), which textile web comprises successive portions (11) 

of a functional textile strip (20) specific to the article, 
wherein each web portion (11) having such a functional strip 
(20) is of a two-layer configuration at least in a region-wise manner and 

forms therebetween a cavity (23) which is produced section-wise (25, 26) 
in at least two partial steps, 
in the first partial step an initial section (25) of the web 
portion (11) with a pocket (27) which is initially still open in the 

double-layer region (24) is produced, 
whereupon the alarm trigger (50) is introduced into the interior 
(23') of the pocket through the opening (28) of the pocket 
and only then in the second partial step an end section (26) of 
the web portion (11) is produced with a pocket closure (29) in the 

double-layer region (24), which supplements the pocket (27) with the 

alarm trigger (50) therein to form a closed cavity (23), and finally 
the textile web (10) provided with the alarm triggers (50) is 
cut into its individual web portions (11) which each form a respective 

finished combination unit (45) with the alarm trigger (50). 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the textile 
production of the web portion (11) is interrupted in the transitional  

 
phase between the initial and end sections (25, 26) for introduction (17) 

of the alarm trigger (50). 
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the yarn material (31, 33) is welded at the intersections (19) of the 

textile web. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the cavity (23) accommodating the alarm trigger 

(50) is produced in a respective strip extension (21) of the actual 
functional strip (20) and
 
   when the finished combination unit (45) is secured to the 

article (40) only the actual functional strip (20) remains visible while 
the strip extension (21) is covered by constituent parts (42) of the 

article. 
A process according to claim 4 characterised in that the fixing 
for securing the combination unit (45) to the article such as a 

transversely extending seam (56) is disposed substantially in the 
transitional zone (16) between the functional strip (20) and its strip 

extension (21). 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that in weaving production of the textile web (10) the 

open pocket (27) produced in the first partial step faces in the warp 
direction with its pocket opening (28) which is disposed at the weft 

tying location (33) and
 
   before introduction (17) of the alarm trigger (50) the warp 

yarns (31) are spread in the manner of a weaving shed (36) until the 
pocket opening (28) which is in the apex of the spread configuration lies 

free towards the shed interior (37) (Figure 5).  
 
A process according to claim 6 characterised in that the alarm 
trigger (50') is firstly guided out of a spatial region (39) laterally 

beside the spread shed into the shed interior (37) with at least one 
motion component which points in the weft direction (18), and
 
   then the alarm trigger is further moved (17) with at least one 

motion component pointing in the warp direction through the pocket 
opening (28) into the interior (23') of the pocket (Figure 6). 
A process according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in that 
the alarm trigger (50', 50) is guided on a curved and in particular part-circular 

path (17) through the lateral opening of the shed (36) into the 
interior (23') of the pocket. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that the alarm trigger (50', 50) is engaged by a gripper 

movable in the manner of a weft feed-in means (38), then transferred (17) 
into the interior (23') of the pocket and finally there released. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that the functional strip (20) is produced as a cover 

strip which is preferably fixed in the lower region of trousers, skirts 
or jackets, or the like. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that the functional strip (20) is produced in the form 

of a waistband which is preferably fixed in the upper region of trousers, 
skirts or the like. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that the functional strip (20) is produced as a tag 

strip for articles of clothing or the like.  
 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that the functional strip (20) is produced from a woven 

label with at least one tubular portion (24) and the tubular portion 
forms the cavity (23) for receiving the alarm trigger (50). 
A process according to claim 13 characterised in that the 
tubular portion (24) for receiving the alarm trigger (50) is produced in 

a strip extension (21) of the woven label and only the woven label (20) 
has graphic or alphanumeric information relating to the origin, use, care 

and/or the material and/or use of the article. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 14 
characterised in that the functional strip (20) is possibly produced with 

a strip extension (21) by knitting.
