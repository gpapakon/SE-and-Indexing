<ABSTRACT>
One version of the kit comprises test ribbons (91), ribbon gripping forceps (45), crown gripping forceps (30), a crown placement tool (14), an adhesive dispenser (12), expendable adhesive (10), an adhesive dispenser stand (14), an inlay/veneer placement tool (5), and a number of plastic or metal shims (92). The crown placement tool (14) is adhered with hot melt adhesive (10) to the biting surface of a posterior crown to be used as a crown placing device. The ribbon forceps is used to grip a thin precut test ribbon on either the front or back side of an artificial crown being placed. The crown placement tool is used to position an artificial crown in the patient's mouth onto the prepared tooth alongside the test-ribbon, whereby withdrawing the test ribbon with the ribbon forceps tests and marks the area of interproximal contact of the crown or inlay as well as the amount of pressure of the contact. The crown gripping forceps is also used to place an artificial crown for final cementation.  The adhesive is not only used to place and remove an artificial crown or inlay for fitting, but is also used for the patient to bite on during cementation to keep the crown or inlay seated.

<DESCRIPTION>
A dental combination of a tooth restoration and a quantity of 
adhesive, and a method of attaching a tooth restoration to a 
placement tool as defined in the preamble of claims 1 and 8, 
respectively, are disclosed in US-A-939 476. Artificial dental crowns cover portions of a tooth 
surface and are normally fabricated away from the patient's 
mouth, in a lab, and then installed in the mouth. Full crowns 
form the entire occlusal surface of a tooth and the sides to 
the gum line. Partial crowns include onlays which cover the 
occlusal surface and sometimes portions of the sides, inlays 
which mainly cover central portions of the occlusal surface 
and may extend partially onto the sides, and veneers which 
mainly cover only a side surface of a tooth. For simplicity, 
all of these artificial elements for covering tooth surfaces 
will often be referred to as crowns in this document, but it 
should be recognized that each procedure discussed herein does 
not necessarily apply to all artificial crowns. In the field of fixed prosthodontics, the proper 
placement and adjustment of artificial crowns has always been 
a cumbersome process at best because it has necessitated 
placing several fingers of a dentist's hand within the 
patient's mouth during the process. This is because as 
practiced now, the placement and fitting of an artificial 
tooth crown normally entails the dentist holding onto the 
crown with fingers of one hand, and then manipulating the 
crown in the patient's mouth to place, mark, fit and cement 
the crown. Often, the marking, fitting and cementing requires 
fingers of the other hand to be placed into the patient's 
mouth as well. Often an artificial crown is fashioned with the 
interproximal contacts somewhat tighter than necessary and  
 
then fitted by grinding and polishing it so that it will fit 
in proper contact with the adjacent teeth. Even if a crown is 
not made intentionally in the oversized manner, the crown may 
fit too tightly or too loosely because of accumulative errors 
due to impression materials and techniques, errors in stone 
dies and molds, changes in the dimension of the wax patterns, 
investing, casting, changes during porcelain firing, and other 
factors. Other causes of improper contacts are because the 
crown was incorrectly manufactured, or because the patient's 
teeth have moved slightly after the impression for the crown 
was made. The interproximal contacts between an artificial crown 
must not be too tight or the adjacent teeth, which are 
attached flexibly to

<CLAIMS>
A dental combination of a tooth restoration (81, 84 or 
87) to be applied to a persons tooth, and a quantity of adhesive 

(10) applied to an exterior surface of the restoration, 
characterized by said adhesive being a hot melt type which is 

solidified at room temperature but is sticky and sufficiently softened at an 
elevated temperatu
re such that it may be dispensed from a glue gun 
directly onto the restoration, said 

adhesive becoming once more solidified when cooled to room 
temperature. 
The combination of Claim 1, including a restoration 
positioning tool (5, or 15) having an end tip embedded in said 

adhesive. 
The combination of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said tool has a 
tip (16) which is generally spherical. 
A combination of Claim 3, wherein said adhesive encloses 
most of said tip. 
The combination of Claims 3 or 4, wherein said tip is 
rotatable within a socket formed by said adhesive surrounding the 

tip. 
The combination of Claim 5, wherein said adhesive when 
solidified, is somewhat resilient such that said tool tip can be 

withdrawn from said socket with either a prying action, and said 
tool tip may be replaced within said socket. 
The combination of Claim 1, wherein the quantity of 
adhesive applied to said restoration is sufficiently large so as to 

be manually gripped by a person's fingers to facilitate the 
placement of a restoration within a patient's mouth. 
A method of attaching a tooth restoration (81, 84 or 87) 
to a placement tool (5 or 15) including heating a quantity of 

adhesive (10) to soften it, joining an end (16) of the tool and the 
surface of said restoration with the heated adhesive, and 

solidifying said adhesive to thereby affix the tool to the 
restoration, said method being characterized by said adhesive being 

of a hot melt type which is solidified at room temperature but is 
sticky and softened with heating sufficiently to be dispensable from 

a glue gun, and will become once more solidified when cooled to room 
temperature.  

 
The method of Claim 8, wherein said tool has a generally 
spherical tip, and including the step of moving said restoration 

and said solidified adhesive relative to said tip so as to break 
the bond between the tip and the adhesive and create a ball and 

socket-type connection between the tip and the adhesive while 
maintaining the connection between the adhesive and the 

restoration. 
The method of Claim 9, wherein said solidified adhesive 
is somewhat resilient such that by applying sufficient separating 

force between the tool and the adhesive, the spherical tip may be 
withdrawn from the socket and replaced into the socket and still 

have sufficient connecting force between the tip and socket.
