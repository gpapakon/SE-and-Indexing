<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers having improved low temperature 
performance characteristics. A thermoplastic elastomer is generally defined as a polymer or 
blend of polymers that can be processed and recycled in the same way as a conventional 
thermoplastic material, yet has properties and performance similar to that of vulcanized 
rubber at service temperatures. Blends or alloys of plastic and elastomeric rubber have 
become increasingly important in the production of high performance thermoplastic 
elastomers, particularly for the replacement of thermoset rubber in various applications. Polymer blends which have a combination of both thermoplastic and elastic properties 
are generally obtained by combining a thermoplastic polyolefin with an elastomeric 
composition in a way such that the elastomer is intimately and uniformly dispersed as a 
discrete particulate phase within a continuous phase of the thermoplastic. Early work with 
vulcanized compositions is found in U.S.-A-3,037,954 which discloses static 
vulcanization as well as the technique of dynamic vulcanization wherein a vulcanizable 
elastomer is dispersed into a resinous thermoplastic polymer and the elastomer is cured while 
continuously mixing and shearing the polymer blend. The resulting composition is a micro-gel 
dispersion of cured elastomer, such as butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber,  
 
polybutadiene or polyisobutene in an uncured matrix of thermoplastic polymer such as 
polypropylene. This patent describes the use of oil additives derived from coal tar, pine tar 
or petroleum in the composition. In U.S.-A-32,028 (Rc.) polymer blends comprising an olefin thermoplastic resin 
and an olefin copolymer rubber are described, wherein the rubber is dynamically vulcanized 
to a state of partial cure. The resulting compositions are reprocessible. The addition of 
various lubricants to the cured blend at about one phr is taught to be useful for improving 
extrusion quality of the compositions. US-A-3,256,362 discloses that polyolefines which have 
been chemically modified with ethylenically unsaturated 
polyesters may be added to rubber. U.S.-A-4,130,534 and 4,130,535 disclose thermoplastic elastomer 
compositions comprising butyl rubber and polyolefin resin, and olefin rubber and polyolefin 
resin, respectively. The compositions are prepared by dynamic vulcanization and the rubber 
component is cured to the extent that it is essentially insoluble in conventional solvents. The 
addition of plasticizers and aromatic,
