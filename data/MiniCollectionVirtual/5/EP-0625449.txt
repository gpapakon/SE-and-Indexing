<ABSTRACT>
A seatbelt retractor for a motor vehicle, having a winding shaft 11 for winding up and unwinding a safety belt, and having a preliminary-locking device 26 for the preliminary locking of the winding shaft 11 against further rotation and for initiation into main locking in which forces exerted by the seatbelt are channelled into a frame connected to the vehicle, and having a securing device 3-5 which, when the seatbelt is drawn off the winding shaft 11 to the full extent up until the point where a certain length of the beginning of the seatbelt is wound up on the winding shaft 11, holds the winding shaft in the preliminary-locking state.

An automatic safety belt retractor for a motor vehicle comprising

a winding shaft (11) for winding on and unwinding a safety belt
webbing,
a pre-locking device (26) for pre-locking of the winding shaft (11) to
prevent further rotary movement and for engagement into a main locking

mode in which forces applied by the belt webbing are transmitted to a frame
connected to the vehicle, wherein
the pre-locking device (26) is rotatable about the winding axis (A) and
has an actuating device (5) which is drivable by the winding shaft (11) at a

rotary speed which is stepped down relative to the winding shaft (11) by way
of a step-down transmission formed by a rolling gear (2) which is driven by

the winding shaft (11) and which engages into an internal tooth arrangement
(13), and wherein
the actuating device (5) assumes a rotary angular position which is

dependent on the respective belt webbing length wound on the winding shaft
(11) and, when the belt webbing is fully withdrawn from the winding shaft

(11), as far as a given belt webbing length wound on the winding shaft (11),
actuates spring-loaded securing components (3, 4) which hold the winding

shaft in the pre-locking condition,

   characterised in that

the actuating device (5) has a transmission ring (1) which has an
eccentric mounting (1, 29) about the axis (A) of the winding shaft,
the internal tooth arrangement (13) is provided at the inside of the
transmission ring (1), and
the rolling gear (2) which engages into the internal tooth arrangement
(13) is non-rotatably connected to the winding shaft (11).
An automatic safety belt retractor according to claim 1
characterised in that the actuating device (5) has an engagement region

(control surface 28) for actuation of the securing components (3, 4), said
engagement region extending over a given angular region (a) about the axis

(A) of the winding shaft. 
An automatic safety belt retractor according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the securing components (3, 4) are mounted on a first

carrier (8) rotatable about the axis (A) of the winding shaft and that the
actuating device (5) is mounted about a second carrier (1) rotatable at the

reduced rotary speed about the winding shaft (A).
An automatic safety belt retractor according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that a belt webbing-sensitive pre-locking device (6 - 9) and

the securing components (3, 4) have the first carrier (8) as a common carrier
which is non-rotatably connected to the winding shaft (11).
An automatic safety belt retractor according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the securing components (3, 4) have a securing lever

(3) which is acted upon by a securing spring (4) and which when the
actuating device (5) is in the engagement condition is biased by the force of

the securing spring (4) into the pre-locking position.
An automatic safety belt retractor according to claim 5
characterised in that a lever axis (10) of the securing lever (3) is rotatable

about the axis (A) of the winding shaft on a given radius and has a sensing
means (27) which can be brought into engagement with the actuating device

(5).
An automatic safety belt retractor according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the second carrier (1) is a component of a nutating

transmission (1, 2) rotatable about the axis (A) of the winding shaft.
An automatic safety belt retractor according to one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that the second carrier (1) is in the form of a transmission

ring with an internally disposed tooth arrangement (13), which is rotatably
mounted eccentrically in a third carrier (12) arranged stationarily with respect

to the axis (A) of the winding shaft, and that a rolling gear (2) non-rotatably
connected to the winding shaft (11) is in engagement with the internally

disposed tooth arrangement (13). 
An automatic safety belt retractor according to claim 8
characterised in that a vehicle-sensitive pre-locking device (14) is also

mounted on the third carrier (12).
