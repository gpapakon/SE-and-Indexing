<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic screw-connection means for the introduction and lead-through, sealing and strain release of cables, lines or hoses. Said screw-connection means is composed of an intermediate connection stub (10) with associated sealing bodies (11) and of a cap nut (12) or union nut. The hollow-cylindrical intermediate connection stub (10) has coaxially arranged tongues (17) which are separated from one another by slits (18). Upon activation of the cap nut (12) or of the union nut, the sealing body (11) is pressed against the circumferential surface of the inserted cable or the like. The width of the tongues (17) of the intermediate connection stub (10) decreases, from their foot, in the direction of the free end. Furthermore, the tongues (17) have a clamping region (19) which runs transversely with respect to the longitudinal extent thereof. The invention provides that each tongue (17) of the intermediate connection stub (10) exhibits such a clamping region (19). In this arrangement, the clamping regions (19) of all the tongues (17) of the intermediate connection stub (10) are arranged thereon such that they point in the same direction on one side. Furthermore, in its rest position, each tongue (17) overlaps the respectively adjacent tongue (17), at least in certain areas, with its clamping region (19). In the case of a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the clamping regions (19) of all the tongues (17) of the intermediate connection stub (10) are located in the tightening direction of the union nut (12). For production reasons, provision is made for all the tongues (17) of the intermediate connection stub (10) and for all the clamping regions (19) of said tongues (17) to be of the same configuration with respect to one another.

Plastic screw fitting for entry and extension, sealing and strain relief of cables, 
ducts or hoses, consisting of an intermediate connection piece (10) with 

associated sealing body (11) and a cap nut (12), tongues (17) separated from 
each other by slits arranged co-axially on the cylindrical hollow intermediate 

connection piece (10), said tongues pressing the sealing body (11) against the 
circumferential face of the fed in cable or suchlike when the union nut (12) is 

actuated, the width of the tongues (17) decreasing from their bases in the 
direction of the free ends, and the tongues (17) showing a clamping area (19) 

which runs transverse to their longitudinal extension,
 
characterised by the fact
 
that each tongue (17) of the intermediate connection piece (10) shows a 

clamping area (19), that the clamping areas (19) of the tongues (17) of the 
intermediate connection piece (10) are arranged on this on one side pointing in 

the same direction, that each tongue (17) in its position of rest, with its clamping 
area (19), overlaps the respective adjacent tongue (17) at least in certain areas, 

and that the clamping areas (19) of all the tongues (17) of the intermediate 
connection piece (10) lie in the tightening direction of the union nut (12). 
Screw fitting according to claim 1 characterised by the fact that the inner 
limiting faces (24) of the clamping areas (19) of all the tongues (17) of the 

intermediate connection piece (10) essentially delimit a circle. 
Screw fitting according to claims 1 or 2 characterised by the fact that the front 
limiting wall (22) of each tongue (17) in the tightening direction of the union nut 

(12) stands back opposite the front part of the clamping area (19). 
Screw fitting according to claims 1 to 3 characterised by the fact that the inner 

and outer limiting faces (24 or 25) of the front part of the clamping area (19) of 
each tongue (17) run inclined towards each other and in each case taper to a 

point (26).  
 
Screw fitting according to claims 1 to 4 characterised by the fact that the surface 
(20) of the tongue (17) shows a shoulderless transition to the surface (23) of the 

clamping area (19). 
Screw fitting according to claims 1 to 5 characterised by the fact that the 
clamping area (19) arranged at the top end of the tongue (17) only extends over 

part of the length of the tongue (17). 
Screw fitting according to claims 1 to 6 characterised by the fact that all the 
tongues (17) of the intermediate connection piece (10) and all the clamping area 

(19) of these tongues (17) are designed and configured in the same way as each 
other.
