<ABSTRACT>
This refrigeration system expansion valve (10) includes a body 
(12) having an inlet (20) and an outlet (22) and a valve assembly 

(24) within the body (12). The valve assembly (24) includes a 
first port (28) communicating with the inlet (20) and a second, 

larger port (30) communicating with the outlet (22) and further 
includes a pin (32) having a first pin portion (34) received by the 

first port (28) and a second pin portion (36) received by the 
second port (30). A stepper motor (100) attached to the valve body 

(12) cooperates with an actuator assembly (60) attached to the pin 
(32) to induce longitudinal movement into the pin and thereby 

control refrigerant flow through the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to expansion valves for 
refrigeration systems and particularly to an expansion valve having 
a dual port and pin valve assembly to control refrigerant flow 
through the valve and preferably uses a stepper motor actuator to 
operate the valve assembly. In general, refrigeration systems of the type under 
consideration consist of a compressor, an evaporator, a condenser 
and an expansion device, typically a thermostatic expansion valve. 
The primary purpose of the expansion valve is to control liquid 
refrigerant flow to the evaporator so that a predetermined amount 
of superheat vapor is maintained in the suction line. Conventional thermostatic expansion valves usually incorporate 
a motor element such as a diaphragm. The diaphragm is responsive 
to the heat in the system, for example at the evaporator outlet, 
and controls a valve port within the valve which is located between 
the valve inlet and the valve outlet. Conventionally, the 
diaphragm is connected to the valve pin by pushrods and, while this 
actuator system works well in many applications, there is a need 
for more precise flow control in other applications. Theoretically, diaphragm actuated expansion valves have 
infinite positional control. However, factors such as diaphragm 
stresses, pushrod friction, and spring side loading create valve  
 
hysteresis. It is hysteresis that makes infinite positional 
control unachievable in practice. Also, diaphragm actuated 
expansion valves have difficulty providing the precision movement 
required when it is desired to lower superheat settings and insure 
stable control. In addition, the stroke limitations of a diaphragm, and the 
fact that these valves are sized for maximum, or worst case, load 
conditions, drastically limit their ability to provide suitable 
performance under partial load conditions. Most refrigeration and 
air conditioning systems operate at less than maximum load most of 
the time. Therefore, an expansion device capable of providing 
lower stable superheat control at reduced loads would provide 
improve operating efficiency. To meet this need, the control of the expansion valve by 
electronic rather than by the more direct thermostatic means has 
been used. There are advantages in using a stepper motor to 
control the valve flow as discussed in commonly owned U.S. Patent 
No. 4,911,404, which is incorporated herein by reference. For 
example, a stepper motor actuated valve provides discrete segments 
of valve stroke for each incremental angular
