<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed which relates to treating an organic waste containing hydrogen and carbon in molten metal contained in a vessel to sequentially form enriched hydrogen and carbon oxide gas streams. In one embodiment, the organic waste is introduced into molten metal, without the addition of a separate oxidizing agent and under conditions sufficient to decompose the organic waste and to generate an enriched hydrogen gas stream and to carbonize the molten metal. Thereafter, a separate oxidizing agent is added into the carbonized molten metal to oxidize the carbon contained in the carbonized molten metal to thereby generate an enriched carbon oxide gas stream and to decarbonize the molten metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
Disposal of organic wastes in landfills and by 
incineration has become an increasingly difficult 
problem because of diminishing availability of disposal 
space, strengthened governmental regulations, and the 
growing public awareness of the impact of hazardous 
substance contamination upon the environment. Release 
of hazardous organic wastes to the environment can 
contaminate air and water supplies thereby diminishing 
the quality of life in the affected populations. To minimize the environmental effects of the 
disposal of organic wastes, methods must be developed 
to convert these wastes into benign, and preferably, 
useful substances. In response to this need, there has 
been a substantial investment in the development of 
alternate methods for suitably treating hazardous 
organic wastes. One of the most promising new methods 
is described in U.S. Patents 4,574,714 and 4,602,574, 
issued to Bach and Nagel. The Bach/Nagel method for 
destroying organic material, including toxic wastes, 
involves decomposition of the organic material to its 
atomic constituents in a molten metal and reformation 
of these atomic constituents into environmentally 
acceptable products, including hydrogen, carbon 
monoxide and/or carbon dioxide gases. The present invention relates to a method for 
treating organic waste in molten metal contained in a  
 
vessel to sequentially form enriched hydrogen gas and 
carbon oxide gas streams. In one embodiment, an organic waste containing 
hydrogen and carbon is introduced into molten metal, 
without the addition of a separate oxidizing agent and 
under conditions sufficient to decompose the organic 
waste and to generate an enriched hydrogen gas stream 
and to carbonize the molten metal. The enriched 
hydrogen gas stream is substantially removed from the 
vessel. Thereafter, a separate oxidizing agent is 
added into the carbonized molten metal to oxidize 
carbon contained in the carbonized molten metal to form 
an enriched carbon oxide gas stream. The enriched 
carbon oxide gas stream is substantially removed from 
the vessel. In another embodiment of the invention employed to 
increase the amount of carbon dioxide to carbon 
monoxide in the enriched carbon oxide gas stream, the 
organic waste is introduced into molten metal contained 
in a vessel which comprises two immiscible metals 
wherein the first immiscible metal has a free energy of 
oxidation, at the operating conditions, greater than 
that for oxidation of carbon to carbon monoxide and the 
second immiscible metal

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating an organic waste containing 
hydrogen and carbon in molten metal contained in a 

vessel to sequentially form enriched hydrogen and 
carbon oxide gas streams comprising the steps of: 


a) introducing the organic waste into molten 
metal, without the addition of a separate 

oxidizing agent and under conditions 
sufficient to decompose the organic waste and 

to form an enriched hydrogen gas stream and 
carbonize the molten metal; 
b) removing substantially all of the formed 
enriched hydrogen gas stream from the vessel; 
c) thereafter adding a separate oxidizing agent 
into the carbonized molten metal to oxidize 

carbon contained in the carbonized molten 
metal to form an enriched carbon oxide gas 

stream and to decarbonize the molten metal; 
and 
d) removing substantially all of the formed 
enriched carbon oxide gas stream from the 

vessel. 
A method of Claim 1 wherein either (a) the enriched carbon 
oxide gas stream comprises carbon monoxide, and 


the molten metal may 
comprise iron, and  

 
the separate oxidizing 
agent may comprise oxygen gas; and/or (b) 
the enriched carbon 
oxide gas comprises a mixture of carbon monoxide 

and carbon dioxide gases, and 
the molten metal may be either (i) 
selected to provide a significantly increased 

molar ratio of carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide 
compared to that produced in molten iron, or (ii) 
manganese, or (iii) 
two immiscible metals having a first 
immiscible metal having a free energy of 

oxidation, at the conditions of the molten metal, 
greater than that of oxidation of atomic carbon to 

form carbon monoxide and a second immiscible metal 
having a free energy of oxidation, at the 

conditions of the molten metal, greater than that 
of oxidation of carbon monoxide to form carbon 

dioxide, for example 
said molten metal may 
comprise an immiscible mixture of iron and 

copper. 
The method of Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the molten 
metal is carbonized and decarbonized in the same 

reactor vessel to generate enriched hydrogen and 
carbon oxide gas streams.
