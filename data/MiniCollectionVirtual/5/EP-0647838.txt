<ABSTRACT>
A spectrophotometer using a charge coupled device 
array (2) as an image receiver in which an image of its 

entrance slit (1) is tilted with respect to columns of 
pixels in the charge coupled device array (2) and in which 

the height of the image of the entrance slit (1) on the 
charge coupled device array (2) is arranged to extend over 

two or more rows of pixels so that the image of the 
entrance slit (1) is skewed over pixels in two adjacent 

columns. Means are provided to analyse the output of the 
pixels to provide information on the intensity distribution 

of each spectral line with respect to wavelength having a 
resolution greater than that of the pitch of the pixels in 

each row of the charge coupled device array (2). Preferably, 
the pixels of the charge coupled device array (2) 

are arranged in perpendicular columns and rows and the 
image of the entrance slit (1) is tilted with respect to 

columns of the charge coupled device array (2) so that the 
rows of pixels on the charge coupled device array (2) are 

generally aligned with the dispersion direction of the or 
each spectral order.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is a move to the use of charge coupled device 
arrays as the image receivers in spectrophotometers. Such 
charge coupled device arrays can replace single 
photodiodes, linear photodiode arrays and photomultiplier 
tubes. There is a potential advantage in using charge 
coupled device arrays because they can capture information 
on more than one spectral line simultaneously which is very 
useful when performing multi-element analysis using 
techniques such as inductively coupled plasma emission 
spectroscopy for the detection of metals in solution. 
Instruments using charge coupled device arrays are 
potentially very much faster for multi-element analysis 
since the information on all of the elements or species is 
captured simultaneously. As it is possible to capture 
information on more than one spectral line simultaneously 
more reliable comparative results can be obtained since all 
the elements being analysed and compared are analysed at 
the same time from exactly the same sample. When using a 
single detector as the image receiving element there is 
inevitably a time lag between the detection of the 
different species which involves a lack of certainty over 
whether the sample and the operating conditions are uniform 
over a period of time. It is often desirable to monitor the intensity profile 
of a particular spectral line, especially when developing 
an analysis method, to examine the spectral line for line 
overlaps and hence interferences on the analytical 
measurements between a line distinctive of one element and 
interfering line from another element. In the past when using a photomultiplier tube, for 
example, it is common to provide an exit slit which is 
matched to that of the entrance slit to isolate light from 
a single spectral line. To obtain information on the  
 
intensity profile of a spectral line, what has been done 
previously is to step the exit slit across the spectral 
line in, for example, steps of a tenth of the width of 
the exit slit. By subsequently analysing the results 
obtained at each step it is possible to produce a plot of 
intensity against wavelength and by examining the shape of 
this plot it is possible to determine whether the spectral 
line is "clean" or whether it includes shoulders or dips 
indicating the presence of light from an interfering 
species. When using a charge coupled device array it would be 
desirable to have a charge coupled device array of 
sufficiently high resolution that each spectral line was 
spread over many pixels in the
