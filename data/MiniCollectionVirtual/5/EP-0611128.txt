<ABSTRACT>
In a nuclear fuel bundle for a boiling water nuclear 
reactor having ferrule spacers, the ferrule spacer closest to 

the lower tie plate is provided with large apertures. These 
large apertures constitute the removal of almost all of the 

material of the ferrule spacer from around the fuel rods 
consistent with structural requirements. In this lowest 

ferrule spacer location, it has been found that these 
apertures within the individual ferrules suppress the tendency 

of the fuel rods downstream of the first spacer to be subject 
to departure from nucleate boiling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel bundles in boiling 
water nuclear reactors and more particularly to ferrule 
spacers utilized with such fuel bundles. In this disclosure, 
the bottom ferrule spacer of the fuel bundle is modified with 
relatively large openings to suppress the possibility of 
departure from nucleate boiling. In boiling water nuclear reactors, fuel bundles are 
utilized. These fuel bundles include a plurality of spaced 
apart vertically upstanding fuel rods, these fuel rods being 
supported on a lower tie plate and extending upwardly to or 
toward and an upper tie plate. The fuel rods are surrounded 
by a fuel channel which extends from the vicinity of the lower 
tie plate to the vicinity of the upper tie plate. The fuel 
bundle channel confines the flow of water within the fuel 
bundle around and about the steam generating fuel rods. The 
lower tie plate allows moderating water coolant to enter the 
fuel bundle; the upper tie plate allows water and generated 
steam to exit the fuel bundle. Both the nuclear design and the operating dynamics of 
a boiling water reactor fuel bundle require that the fuel rods 
be braced in parallel side by side relation at their designed 
spacial separation. This prevents abrading contact of the 
fuel rods and maintains the fuel rods in designed separation 
for maximum nuclear efficiency. In virtually all spacers, each fuel rod at each 
spacer is individually surrounded and held in place. 
Typically, seven spacers at evenly spaced vertical intervals 
are used along the length of the fuel rods within a fuel 
bundle. As the fuel rods extending between the tie plates are 
in the order of 160 inches in length, the spacers are usually  
 
placed at 20 inch intervals along the vertical length of the 
fuel rods. It is now known that a particular advantageous type 
of fuel bundle spacer utilized is a so-called "ferrule 
spacer." Ferrule spacers can be constructed from an alloy of 
zirconium known as Zircalloy. This material is particularly 
advantageous as it has a low neutron absorption cross section 
which avoids the parasitic absorption of neutrons within the 
fuel bundle. Ferrule spacers comprise relatively short -- on the 
order of 1 inch high -- spacers with discrete ferrules (or 
cylinders) surrounding each fuel rod at the elevation of the 
spacer. Typically, each ferrule of a ferrule spacer defines 
four internal stops against which a fuel rod interior of the 
spacer is biased. A spring -- typically of the loop variety 
-- extends into the spacer generally
