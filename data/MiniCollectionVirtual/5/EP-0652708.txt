<ABSTRACT>
A selective herbicidal composition for controlling grasses and weeds in crops of cultivated plants, comprising: (a) a herbicidally effective amount of a sulfonyl urea of formula (I) wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl; R2 and R3 are each independently of the other methyl or methoxy; and R4 is hydrogen or methyl; and (b) an effective amount of a quinoline derivative of formula (II) wherein R is hydrogen or C1-C8alkyl, and X is hydrogen or chlorine, as safener for antagonising the herbicide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selective herbicidal composition for controlling grasses 
and weeds in crops of cultivated plants, especially in cereals crops, which composition 
consists of a herbicide and a safener (antidote) that protects the cultivated plants, but not 
the weeds, from the phytotoxic action of the herbicide, and to the use of said composition 
or combination of herbicide and safener for controlling weeds in crops of cultivated plants. When applying herbicides, crop plants may be severely damaged owing to such factors as 
concentration of herbicide and type of application, species of crop plant, soil 
characteristics, temperature and rainfall. In particular, severe damage may be caused 
when, in the course of crop rotation, other crop plants which have no or only insufficient 
resistance to herbicides are grown in succession to plants that are resistant to herbicides. To counteract this problem, the proposal has already been made to use different 
compounds which are able specifically to antagonise the harmful action of the herbicide 
on the crop plant, i.e. to protect the crop plant without markedly influencing the herbicidal 
action on the weeds to be controlled. It has, however, been found that the proposed 
safeners very often have a species-specific activity both with respect to the crop plants and 
to the herbicide and, in some cases also, contingent on the mode of application, i.e. a 
specific safener is often suitable only for a specific crop plant and a specific class of 
herbicide. For example, EP-A-0 094 349 discloses quinoline derivatives that protect crop 
plants from the phytotoxic action of herbicides of specific compound classes, including 
phenoxy-propionate herbicides, ureas, carbamates or diphenyl ethers. It has now been found that very specific quinoline derivatives disclosed in 
EP-A-0 094 349 are suitable for protecting crop plants from the phytotoxic action of a 
special class of sulfonyl urea herbicides. Accordingly, the invention relates to a selective herbicidal composition which contains, in 
addition to inert components such as carriers, solvents and wetting agents, as active 
component a mixture comprising  
 
a) a herbicidally effective amount of a sulfonyl urea of formula I 
 
wherein 
R₁ is hydrogen or methyl; 
R₂ and R₃ are each independently of the other methyl or methoxy; and 
R₄ is hydrogen or methyl, or a salt of this compound with an amine, an alkali metal base 
or alkaline earth metal base or with a quaternary ammonium base; and b) an
