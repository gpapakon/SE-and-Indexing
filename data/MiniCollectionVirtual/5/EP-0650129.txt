<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for automatic formatting of user selected 
text in a word processing system. A number of format options are displayed to 

the user and a text format selection is then obtained from the user for a 
selected format option. An identifier identifying the selected text format is 

stored in a text format data structure. One or more portions of existing text are 
thereafter selected by the user. For each selected portion of existing text, the 

selected portion is formatted with the text format identified by the identifier 
stored in the data structure. These steps are repeated until canceled by the 

user or until the user enters new text. In a preferred embodiment, the word 
processing system provides a conventional mode for performing conventional 

text formatting in which a text format is specified only after a single portion of 
existing text is selected by the user to which to apply the specified text format. 

The word processing system also provides an automatic formatting mode for 
automatically formatting any number of selected portions of text with a selected 

text format, as described above. By selecting a text format without first 
selecting a portion of existing text to which to apply the selected text format, 

the user places the word processing system in automatic formatting mode. 
Canceling the
 selected text format or entering new text converts the word 
processing system back to the conventional mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to word processing
systems and, more specifically, to a method and system for automatically
formatting user selected portions of text.Word processing systems are widely used in homes and
businesses to allow computer users to create and modify text within text
documents. A word processing system is typically provided as a software
application executable on a computer system having a computer and various
peripheral devices. The software application, referred to herein as a word
processing program, provides users with the capability of creating, inserting,
deleting and arranging text. The computer has a memory that stores the word
processing program and also stores files which represent the text documents
as data. When the word processing program is executed, a user can create a
text document by entering text and, if desired, modifying the text and then
storing a file which represents the text document on a peripheral storage
device. Or, a user can modify an existing text document by reading an
appropriate file into memory from a peripheral storage device the text
document as desired.Modem word processing systems also provide a variety of
features by which users can enhance the text documents they create on such
systems. One such enhancement feature is text formatting. Text formatting
allows users to select different text formats to be applied to text within a text
document. These text formats include character formats, which are applied to
one or more characters in the text document, and paragraph formats, which
are applied to paragraphs in the text document. Well-known examples of
character formats are bold, italics, underlining, and the like. Well-known
examples of paragraph formats are left alignment, right alignment, single
spacing, double spacing, indentation, and so on. Text formatting can be applied to format new text to be entered
into a text document, and to format existing text which is already in the text
document. In formatting new text, the word processing system can simply
apply a text format specified by the user to each new character typed into the
text document. In formatting existing text, however, the word processing
system must also obtain from the user a selection of what portion of the
existing text is to be formatted. The conventional method employed is for the
user to first select a portion of existing text to which to apply a text format, and
then to select a text format to apply to that selected portion. For example, if
the user wishes to

<CLAIMS>
A method of formatting text in a system for word processing comprising a
display (130) and a user input device (110, 120), the method comprising the

steps of:

(a) displaying text on the display (130);
(b) displaying one or more visual buttons (206, 208) on the display (130), the
visual buttons (206, 208) representing text formats for formatting text;
(c) selecting a displayed visual button (206, 208) with the user input device
(110, 120) in order to select a text format;
(d) after step (c), selecting each of a plurality of non-contiguous portions of
the displayed text by using the user input device (110, 120) to point to the

portion; and
(e) in response to each selection of a portion, automatically formatting and
redisplaying the selected portion in accordance with the selected text

format until new text is entered.
The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of:

(f) after step (c), displaying a cursor (212) on the display (130), the cursor
(212) indicating the selected text format.
The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, further comprising the steps of:

(g) after step (e), selecting a second text format;
(h) after step (g), selecting a further portion of the displayed text by using the
