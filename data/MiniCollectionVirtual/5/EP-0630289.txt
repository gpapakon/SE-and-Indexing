Process for the catalytic afterburning of exhaust 
gases from the phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride 

production containing carbon monoxide and/or oxidizable 
organic compounds in the prescence of molecular oxygen 

and a TiO
2
 supported catalyst, characterized in that the 
TiO
2
 supported catalyst contains 

a) at least 70 % by weight, calculated as TiO
2
, of a 
titanium dioxide component, 
b) at least 1 % by weight, calculated as V
2
O
5
, of a 
vanadium oxide component selected from the group 

consisting of vanadium oxides of the formula V

O
2n+1
, V

or V
n
O
2n-1
 or a vanadium compound which is converted into 
vanadium oxide on heating in air and 
c) 0.01 to 0.9 % by weight, calculated as noble metal, 
of one or more noble metals selected from the group 

consisting of palladium, platinum and rhodium, where the 
noble metals can also be used as oxides, hydroxides, 

acids and/or chlorides. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that as noble metal component, use is made of one or more 

selected from the group consisting of palladium, platinum 
and their oxides, hydroxides, acids and/or chlorides. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the titanium oxide component is doped with up to 

5 % by weight, based on TiO
2
 in the anatase form, of 
compounds of yttrium, lanthanum, the lanthanide elements, 

zirconium, hafnium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum or 
tungsten. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the doping compound contained is 0.1 - 5 % by 

weight, based on TiO
2
 in the anatase form, of tungsten 
oxide or a compound which is converted into tungsten 

oxide on heating. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the catalyst is used in the form of homogeneous 

mouldings or extrudates or in the form of a non-porous or 
porous honeycomb-like support body, or support body 

provided with ducts, which is coated with the components  
 

a) to c). 
Process according to Claim 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the catalytic afterburning is carried out at 

operating temperatures between 150 and 550°C and kick-off 
temperatures between 150 and 230°C.
