<DESCRIPTION>
This invention in the vaccine arts is concerned with an influenza
immunizing dosage form comprising a liposome and an antigen of
Influenza, particularly the hemagglutinin or bromelain fragment,
wherein said liposome and antigen are present in an immunization
dose. Additionally, a dosage form, including such form particularly
adapted to producing an immune response, comprising a salt form of
an organic acid derivative of a sterol and an antigen wherein said
organic acid derivative of a sterol and antigen are present in an
immunization dose, and method of use. Further, a dosage form,
including such form particularly adapted to producing an immune
response, comprising dimyristolyphosphatidylcholine
(DMPC)/cholesterol liposomes, optionally in an aluminum hydroxide
gel, and an antigen wherein said DMPC/cholesterol and antigen are
present in an immunization dose, and method of use.In the vaccine art antigens are introduced into an organism in a
manner so as to stimulate an immune response in the host organism.
The induction of an immune response depends on many factors among
which are believed to include the chemical composition and
configuration of the antigen, the immunogenic constitution of the
challenged organism, and the manner and period of administration of
the antigen. An immune response has many facets some of which are
exhibited by the cells of the immune system, (e.g.,B-lymphocytes,
T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells). Immune system cells
may participate in the immune response through interaction with
antigen, interaction with other cells of the immune system, the
release of cytokines and reactivity to those cytokines. Immune 
response is conveniently (but arbitrarily) divided into two main
categories -- humoral and cell-mediated. The humoral component of
the immune response includes production of immunoglobulins specific
for the antigen. The cell-mediated component includes the
generation of delayed-type hypersensitivity and cytotoxic effector
cells against the antigen.In some instances immune response is the result of an initial or
priming dose of an antigen that is followed by one or more booster
exposures to the antigen. Priming with relatively strong immunogens
and liposomes is discussed in "Liposomal Enhancement of the
Immunogenicity of Adenovirus Type 5 Hexon and Fiber Vaccines",
Kramp, W.J. et al., Infection and Immunity, 25:771-773 (1979) and
"Liposomes as Adjuvants with Immunopurified Tetanus Toxoid: the
Immune Response", Davis, D. et al., Immunology Letters, 14:341-8
(1986/1987)
