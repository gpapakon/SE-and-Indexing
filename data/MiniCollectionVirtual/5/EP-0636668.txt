further comprising, as a barium dissolving inhibitor, at 
least one of (a) alkali metal sulfate, (b) beryllium 

sulfate, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate or strontium 
sulfate, (c) aluminum sulfate, (d) zinc sulfate, and (e)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid
drawing composition.Solid drawing compositions such as crayons, oil
pastels, plastic crayons, colored pencils and the like
generally comprise a wax, an extender pigment, a coloring
pigment, a concentration adjuster, etc. Among these
components, the extender pigment, concentration adjuster
and the like may contain a predetermined amount of barium
sulfate which enables the components to exhibit their
functions effectively.However, in recent years, standards for safety
of toys have been altered in Europe and the U.S. to
tighten control. Consequently pigments and like
materials containing specific soluble heavy metals have
been legally regulated. Since such heavy metals include
barium, the use of barium lake and like pigments is
restricted. The control is strict especially in Europe.
For example, under European Standards EN 71, the detected
value of barium as measured by the prescribed method
shall not exceed 500 ppm.At present, barium sulfate is not controlled 
under said regulation. However, the barium sulfate used
as an extender pigment or as a concentration adjuster for
a coloring pigment is slightly dissolved out so that a
detected value of barium may exceed the prescribed level
of 500 ppm, thereby posing a safety problem.On the other hand, currently, no material is
superior to barium sulfate as an additive for an extender
pigment, concentration adjuster and the like, and it is
difficult to find out a substitute for barium sulfate.BR-A-8903495 (Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 715, No. 73024) discloses coloring compositions for plastics and rubbers which may contain, as pigment, a certain amount of, i.a., zinc sulfate and/or barium sulfate.An object of the present invention is to
provide a solid drawing composition which contains barium
sulfate and in which the barium is substantially not
dissolved out.The present invention provides a solid drawing
composition containing barium sulfate, the composition
comprising, as a substance capable of inhibiting barium
from dissolving out, a certain amount of at least one compound selected from (a) alkali metal
sulfate, (b) beryllium sulfate, magnesium sulfate,
calcium sulfate or strontium sulfate, (c) aluminum
sulfate, (d) zinc sulfate, and (e) a double salt of said
sulfates (a) to (d).The inventors found that when a specific
sulfate is incorporated in a drawing composition 
containing barium sulfate, the barium can be
significantly inhibited or prevented from dissolving out.
The present invention has been accomplished based on
