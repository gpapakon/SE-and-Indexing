<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a demodulation structure and a method for
downconverting and demodulating a modulated digital signal.Demodulation structures and methods for downconverting and demodulating a
digitally modulated signal are known from and used in many different applications,
in which signals are transmitted from a transmitting apparatus to a receiving
apparatus. The transmission can be either wireless over an air interface or through a
wired connection. Of course, the chosen structure and method for downconverting
and demodulating a transmitted digitally modulated signal depends essentially on the
modulation scheme used on the transmitting side and the transmission medium.Figure 10 shows an example for a demodulation structure for downconverting and
demodulating a digitally modulated signal S0. The shown demodulation structure is
e.g. used for downconverting and demodulating a high frequency signal (RF signal)
received in a mobile terminal of a wireless telecommunication system, such as the
GSM or the UMTS system. Hereby, a transmitted RF signal is received by an
antenna of the mobile terminal and supplied to a RF receiver. The digital RF signal
is then supplied to a demodulation structure as e.g. shown in figure 10. Another
possibility could be to downconvert the RF signal into an intermediate frequency
band, whereafter the intermediate signal is further downconverted and demodulated
in a structure as shown in figure 10.In wireless telecommunication, usually an I/Q-modulation is used, in which the
modulation states can be represented in an I/Q-diagram. The horizontal axis hereby
represents the I part, i.e. the part of the signal component which is in phase to the
carrier signal, and the vertical axis represents the Q part, i.e. the quadrature
component perpendicular to the phase of the carrier signal. The digital information
signal is thus transmitted by means of the phase of the carrier signal, whereby the
phase of the carrier signal is switched between the different discrete states depending
on the symbol to be transmitted. This so-called phase shift key modulation (PSK
modulation) is used in many different application areas, very often in combination
with amplitude shift keying. The GSM e.g. uses a GMSK modulation (Gaussian
minimum shift keying modulation). Demodulation and downconversion of correspondingly I/Q-modulated signals is e.g.
done by analog demodulation structures as shown in figure 10 comprising a local
oscillator 101, two mixers 102, 103, a 90 degree phase shifter 104,
