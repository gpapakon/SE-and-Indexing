<ABSTRACT>
A press-fit connection element (1), in particular a wheel bolt, which can be pressed in in a bore 3 when an axial force is applied exhibits a shank 5 and a stop 4 which has a greater diameter than said shank 5 and is in the form of a head, central collar or the like. On the sides directed towards the stop 4, the shank 5 has a press-fit portion 10 which is of an oversize with respect to the associated bore 3. On the side directed away from the stop 4, the shank 5 preferably exhibits a portion 22 with a fastening thread 23. The press-fit portion 10 exhibits a multiple-thread, preferably at least three-thread, helical profile 11. The helical profile 11 has a bearing percentage of at least 30 % and is produced by cold forming.

<CLAIMS>
Force fit connecting element (1), especially wheel stud, 
which may be force fitted in a drill hole (3) by exertion of an 

axial force, with a shank (5) and a stop (4) in the shape of a 
head, a collar or the like having a larger diameter than the 

shank (5), where the shank (5) has on the side facing the stop 
(4) a force fit section (10) made from a multiple-threaded 

helical profile (11) by cold forming, which has an overmeasure 
with respect to the corresponding drill hole (3), and on the 

side facing away from the stop (4) a section (22) with fastening 
thread (23), 
characterized in that
 the force fit section (10) 
with the multiple-threaded, preferably at least triple-threaded, 

helical profile (11) - with respect to the nominal diameter of 
the drill hole (3) - has an overmeasure avoiding the danger of 

plastic material displacement during the fitting, and that the 
helical profile (11) - with respect to the cylindrical surface 

area of the drill hole (3) - has a contact area fraction (33) of 
at least 30 %. 
Force fit connecting element according to claim 1, 

characterized in that
 the outer diameter (16) of the helical 
profile (11) is formed to be larger than the outer diameter of 

a cylindrical force fit section having an equal function. 
Force fit connecting element according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 the helical profile (11) has a flank angle 
(30) in the range of 0° to 30°, preferably approximately 15°. 
Force fit connecting element according to one of the claims 
1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the outer diameter (16) of the 
helical profile (11) is defined by gauging, especially by 

milling, rolling or exact partial extrusion.  
 
Force fit connecting element according to one of the claims 
1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the slug used in the production of 
the force fit connecting element has a continuous shank diameter 

(21), which is the outer diameter for the helical profile as 
well as for the thread profile. 
Force fit connecting element according to one of the claims 
1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the helical profile (11) has a 
larger core diameter (26) than the core diameter (25) of the 

section (22) with the fastening thread (23). 
Force fit connecting element according to claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the force fit section (10) with the helical 
profile (11) has an overmeasure in the region of 0.3 to 0.7 %, 

preferably approximately 0.5 %, with respect to the nominal 
diameter of the drill hole (3).
