<DESCRIPTION>
Nonwoven fabrics have been known for many years.
Many nonwoven fabrics are produced by forming a web or
batt of textile like fibers and treating the fiber batt
with binder to hold fibers together and provide some
strength to the batt. In other instances a nonwoven
fabric may be produced by treating a fiber batt with water
streams to cause the fibers to entangle with each other
and provide some strength in the batt. Many methods have
been developed for treating fiber batts in such a manner
in an attempt to duplicate the physical properties and
appearance of woven fabrics. While the methods developed
for producing non-woven fabrics have produced fabrics with
some of the characteristics of woven or knitted fabrics,
one property, namely drapability, has been difficult to
achieve. None of the nonwoven fabrics produced to date
have had the appearance, drapability or flexibility of
tricot knit fabrics.US-3498874 discloses an apertured nonwoven fabric having tanglelaced
fibers manufactured on a high-impact-pressure liquid stream
device. The fabric resembles a woven textile fabric in both
appearance and properties and features a zig-zag pattern along
parallel bands interconnected laterally by fibre bundles defining rows of
apertures between the bands.It is an object of the present invention to produce
a nonwoven fabric which emulates the appearance and
draping characteristics of the tricot knitted fabrics.It is a further object of the present invention to
produce a very drapable nonwoven fabric having good
strength in all directions. Further objects of the
present invention will be apparent from the following
detailed description.The nonwoven fabrics of the present invention
are herein disclosed in accordance with claim 1, and have an
upper surface and a lower surface. Disposed between these
surfaces are a plurality of fibers. The fibers are 
intertwined and interentangled with each other and define
a predetermined pattern of openings in the nonwoven
fabric. A portion of the openings include a fiber segment
loop disposed in the opening. The loop comprises a
plurality of substantially parallel fiber segments which
are in the shape of a U. The open end of the U is
directed towards one surface of the fabric while the
closed end of the U is directed towards the opposite
surface of the fabric. The nonwoven fabrics of the
present invention have excellent drapability and have a
drape index in all directions of the fabric of 75 degrees
or greater.Figure 1 is a photomicrograph of a nonwoven fabric of
the present
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A nonwoven fabric formed on a topographically configured support member
having a plurality of raised, three-dimensional areas and a plurality of holes between

said three-dimensional areas and extending through said support member, said fabric
having an upper surface facing away from said support member when said fabric is

formed and a lower surface supported on the top of said three-dimensional areas when
said fabric is formed, said fabric comprising a plurality of fibers disposed between said

surfaces, said fibers being rearranged by the application of fluid under pressure to the
fabric upper surface and said fibers being intertwined and interentangled with adjacent

fibers to define a pattern of openings (11) extending through said fabric, a portion of
said openings (11) having substantially parallel fiber segment loops in the shape of a U

disposed therein with the open end of the U directed towards one surface of said fabric
and the closed end of the U directed towards the other surface of said fabric, said fabric

having a drape index in all directions of the fabric of at least about 80 degrees.
A nonwoven fabric according to claim 1, wherein the loops (12) are disposed in
substantially the center of the opening (11).
A nonwoven fabric according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the openings (11)
in the fabric are in a pattern of rows with said rows of openings (11) extending in the

longitudinal and cross directions of the fabric.
A nonwoven fabric according to claim 3, wherein the loops (12) are disposed in
spaced apart rows of openings (11) extending in the cross direction of the fabric.
