<ABSTRACT>
Transversal perforating apparatus of paper for 
printers fed by a continuous strip of paper (1) without 

lateral dragging holes. The apparatus (12) comprises a 
perforator roller (13) holding a blade (16) substantially 

transversal to and engaging on a pressure roller (14) 
rotating in synchronism with the perforator roller (13). 

Means for varying the speed of the perforator roller (13) 
are provided for as well as means for measuring the 

position of the blade (16) with respect to the paper which 
communicate with a central processor. It is possible, 

therefore, to make transversal perforations coincident 
with the beginning and the end of each page printed by 

printing heads (2,3) being able to also vary the interval 
between two successive perforations during the course of 

printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field 
of printers and more precisely it relates to an apparatus 
for the transversal perforation of paper for printers fed 
by a continuous strip of paper without longitudinal 
dragging holes. Furthermore, the invention relates to the 
respective method for synchronization of the perforation 
of the paper with the beginning of the printed page. Data printers generally use paper already provided 
with transversal perforations for the separation of 
adjacent sheets and furthermore use paper having lateral 
longitudinal holes which allow it to be dragged by means 
of paper-dragging rollers provided with small teeth which 
engage in said holes. The paper, therefore, requires 
treatment upstream from printing consisting in the 
unrolling of virgin paper and the forming of lateral holes 
and transversal perforations, the perforations being 
produced at a fixed interval such as 12 inches. The paper 
is then furnished in bobbins or in packages of folded 
"accordion" sheets. The presence of the lateral dragging holes normally 
facilitates the control of the paper during the printing 
step which can be carried out by means of paper-dragging 
rollers. The transversal perforations are, on the other 
hand, normally accompanied by a preceding notch which 
allows a sensor to inform the printer of the exact 
position of said perforations in order to allow the 
printing heads to initiate printing in correspondence to 
the beginning of each sheet of paper delimitated by two 
consecutive perforations. The need for printers, especially when of large 
dimensions, which operate with a continuous strip of paper 
that has not been pre-processed, and, instead, comes 
directly from the paper mill in the form of a bobbin, is 
strongly felt. Such paper obviously lacks lateral  
 
dragging holes and transversal perforations. Thus 
savings are obtained both by the fact that, by not having 
lateral borders which comprise the dragging holes, more 
narrow, and thus less, paper can be used, and by the fact 
that, by not having to be pre-processed, the paper can be 
obtained directly from the mill at a lower price. These 
two savings are advantageous to large printer users, such 
as banks, utilities companies, firms, etc. with large 
numbers of clients to whom it is necessary to communicate 
information such as invoices, financial statements, 
bulletins, etc.. The quantity of paper in circulation is 
enormous, and printers able to satisfy volumes of this 
nature operate at a considerable

<CLAIMS>
Transversal perforating apparatus for the paper of 
printers fed by a continuous strip of paper without 

dragging holes, said printers being provided with at least 
one printing head (2,3) crossed by said strip (1) and 

comprising means for the control of the linear position of 
the strip which communicate with a central processor (24), 

characterized in that it comprises at least one perforator 
roller (13) having an axis substantially orthogonal to 

said strip (1) and holding at least one blade (16) 
substantially parallel to said roller (13), a pressure 

roller (14) pressing against said blade (16) at every 
rotation of the same and rotating in synchronism with said 

perforator roller (13), means (15) for the variation of 
the speed of said perforator roller being provided for as 

well as means (22) for measuring the position of said 
blade (16) with respect to said paper (1) communicating 

with said central processor, whereby it can make 
perforations coinciding with the beginning and end of each 

printed page, being able, also, to vary the interval 
between two successive perforations during the course of 

printing. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said means for 
measuring the position of said blade (16) with respect to 

said paper (1) comprise an encoder (22) integral with the 
rotational axis of said perforator roller (13). 
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 2, wherein said 
blade (16) has a helicoidal form and said perforator 

roller (13) is mounted on a support (30) which can be 
inclined with respect to the direction orthogonal to said 

strip (1). 
Method for transversal perforation within a printer of 
a strip of paper (1) or similar material without lateral 

dragging holes in synchronism with the beginning and end 
 

of each printed page, characterized in that it comprises 
the steps of: 


friction dragging of said paper (1) through a 
perforating apparatus (12) producing transversal 

perforations on the same; 
reading of the position of the perforations 
produced; 
measurement of the linear extension of said paper 
(1) crossing the printing heads (2,3) comprised in said 

printer; 
calculation of the position corresponding to the 
beginning of each page to be printed, and of the printing 

order to said heads (2,3) in synchronism with the position 
of the perforations. 
Transversal perforation method according to claim 4 
wherein the speed of the perforating apparatus (12) is 

varied as a function of the interval between two 
consecutive perforations, at the same paper speed.
