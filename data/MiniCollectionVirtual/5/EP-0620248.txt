<ABSTRACT>
A compound having a group -N=N-, such as a 
benzotriazole, is added to a conductive silicone rubber 

composition comprising an organopolysiloxane, conductive 
carbon black, and an organic peroxide. The composition 

permits of atmospheric hot air vulcanisation with the aid 
of an organic peroxide, irrespective of the inclusion of 

carbon black, and has good shelf stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a conductive
silicone rubber composition containing
conductive carbon black, and more preferably
to conductive silicone rubber compositions
which have good storage stability and cure
into a satisfactory rubber product through
atmospheric hot air vulcanization (HAV).Most rubbery materials are electric
insulators. A number of conductive rubbers are
available as mixtures of rubbery material and
conductive agents. For example, rubbers having
carbon black blended therein to provide an
electric resistivity of from 105 to 10 Ω-cm are
conductive rubbers which are used in various
applications.Silicone rubber is also widely used as
electrically insulating rubber because of its
high-temperature resistance, low-temperature 
resistance and weatherability. It can also be
used as conductive silicone rubber by adding
conductive agents, as with other rubbery
materials.The conductive agents which are added to
silicone rubber for imparting electric
conductivity are typically carbon black,
graphite, various metal powders such as silver,
nickel, and copper, various non-conductive
particles and short fibers surface treated with
silver or similar metals, carbon fibers, and
metallic fibers. By mixing these conductive
agents, the resistivity of silicone rubber can
be reduced to the order of 1010 to 10-3 Ω-cm
depending on the type and amount of conductive
agent without detracting from the inherent
properties of silicone rubber. Among others,
carbon black and metal powders such as silver
and nickel are often used where it is desired to
produce highly conductive silicone rubber having
a resistivity of less than 105 Ω-cm. Carbon
black is most often used because of cost.However, only a limited vulcanization
system is applicable to conductive silicone
rubber compositions having blended therein 
acetylene black and other carbon black as a conductive agent when they are continuously
molded as by extrusion molding and vulcanized
into a length of article such as a seal, gasket
and roll. More particularly, typical organic
peroxide vulcanization fails to yield
satisfactory molded products. If acyl series
peroxides commonly used in atmospheric hot air
vulcanization (HAV) of conventional silicone
rubber compositions, for example, benzoyl
peroxide and 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide are
used in carbon black-containing systems, the
carbon black acts to restrain vulcanization. If
alkyl series peroxides, for example, dicumyl
peroxide and di-tert-butyl peroxide are used
in carbon black-containing systems, compression
