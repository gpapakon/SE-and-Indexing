<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for applying a reflective coating to a front face of an optical fibre, especially for a fibre-optic medical probe. The front face (24) of an optical fibre (10) is subjected to a controlled flux (45) of vapour molecules suitable for forming an interference dielectric multilayer deposition under conditions such that the front face (24) extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to the general direction of the controlled flux (45), this making it possible for the front face to have interference layers of controlled thickness which possess selective reflective-mirror properties, whereas the side walls of the optical fibre do not possess these properties. Application especially to medical probes.
