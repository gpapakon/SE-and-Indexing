<ABSTRACT>
Process for removing sulphur compounds from a gas stream (2) 
comprising the steps of (a) converting the sulphur compounds to 

sulphuric acid (1, 5); (b) separating the sulphuric acid from the 
gas stream (8), and (c) supplying the sulphuric acid (16) into the 

thermal stage (18) of a Claus process to allow the sulphuric acid 
to react with hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for removing sulphur 
compounds from a gas stream containing sulphur compounds for 
example hydrogen sulphide and/or sulphur dioxide. Such a gas stream is for example the off-gas from a Claus 
process, which is a process for manufacturing elemental sulphur 
from hydrogen sulphide. The Claus process comprises two stages: a 
thermal stage and a catalytic stage. In the thermal stage part of 
the hydrogen sulphide is oxidized to sulphur dioxide and the 
remainder of the hydrogen sulphide is allowed to react with the 
sulphur dioxide to elemental sulphur. As in the thermal stage not 
all hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide will react, the thermal 
stage is followed by the catalytic stage in which the remaining 
hydrogen sulphide reacts with sulphur dioxide to elemental sulphur. 
As the reaction to elemental sulphur is an equilibrium reaction, 
the conversion is not complete and the off-gas from the Claus 
process will include small amounts hydrogen sulphide and sulphur 
dioxide. Examples of gas streams containing as sulphur compounds only 
sulphur dioxide are flue gas from a furnace and off-gas from a 
regenerator of a fluidized catalytic cracking process. The sulphur compounds in the gas stream may further include 
organic sulphur compounds such as carbonyl sulphide, carbon disulphide 
and mercaptans. In the article "SNPA's process for H₂SO₄ production developed 
with eye on air pollution" by G L Guyot and J P Zwilling, The Oil 
and Gas Journal, 21 November 1966, pages 198-200 is disclosed a 
process for removing sulphur compounds from the off-gas of a Claus 
process, which process comprises converting the sulphur compounds 
via sulphur trioxide to sulphuric acid and separating the sulphuric 
acid from the gas stream.  The formed sulphuric acid is a salable product. Applicant now proposes to improve the known process. To this 
end the process for removing sulphur compounds from a gas stream 
according to the present invention comprises the steps of (a) 
converting the sulphur compounds to sulphuric acid; (b) separating 
the sulphuric acid from the gas stream, and (c) allowing sulphuric 
acid to react with hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. In the process of the present invention the sulphuric acid is 
not removed as a salable product, in stead formed sulphuric acid is 
removed by allowing it to react with hydrogen sulphide to elemental 
sulphur. Suitably all sulphuric acid is allowed to react with hydrogen 
sulphide to elemental sulphur. The reaction between
