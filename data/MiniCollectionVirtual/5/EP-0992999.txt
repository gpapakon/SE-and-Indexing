<ABSTRACT>
Protection of man from artificial electromagnetic radiation is achieved through
affecting the thymus with a low-frequency electromagnetic field at a frequency

corresponding to that of the Shuman wave.
The method implementation device contains a generator (1) connected to a
transmitting antenna (2), a comparator (3) and a logical bloc (4). The generator (1)

serves as source of an electromagnetic field with an oscillation frequency
corresponding to that of the Shuman wave oscillations. The intensity of the

electromagnetic field is adjusted with the help of the logical bloc (4), which processes
the signal from the comparator (3) comparing the current voltage between the

acupunctural thymus projection points of the patient with the optimal value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention applies to the field of medicine and medical equipment and can be used
for protecting living organisms from the effects of artificial electromagnetic radiation,
which cause serious physiological and functional problems, thus being dangerous for
human health and life.The known methods of protecting man from artificial electromagnetic radiation and
related implementation devices are based on creating sources of electromagnetic
fields to offset the oscillations of artificial electromagnetic fields.There is, for example, a device for balancing the surrounding electromagnetic field,
where several electromagnetic field sources are used to produce balancing oscillations
and offset the dangerous radiation emanating from cathode-ray tube (CRT) screens
and motor vehicles. The device can be installed on vehicles and should contain at
least three radiation sources to balance the electromagnetic field.

(USSR patent Nº 1718710, A61 N 1/16, publ. in 1992).The above device and the related method do not ensure protection from other
radiation of unnatural origin (high-voltage transmission lines, television and radio
stations, radar equipment mobile phones, etc.).There are also protection devices using a high-frequency arc converter or a gas-discharge
generator as a source of electromagnetic field oscillations.These devices provide a local zone of compensating different types of artificial
radiation.

(RF patent Nº 2033200, A61N 1/16, publ. in 1995; RF patent Nº 2071366, A61N 1/16,
publ. in 1997).These devices and the method they put into practice do not ensure effective protection
from artificial electromagnetic fields, since they form a local compensation zone, 
inside which dangerous electromagnetic radiation emanated by high-voltage
equipment is suppressed.There are devices to protect man from artificial electromagnetic radiation, which
contain a low-frequency electromagnetic-wave generator connected to an oscillator.

(French application Nº 2486406, A61N 1/16, publ. in 1983).In these devices, the generator frequency lies within the range of 1-1000 Hz.The generator operation in these devices, however, is supposed to cover quite a wide
range, and there is no bloc to generate a one-frequency wave for a prolonged period of
time, with the frequency equal to that of the Shuman wave.A method and device for protection of man from electromagnetic radiation (useful
model Nº 1805, A61 N 1/16, publ. in 1996) has been selected as the closest analog.
The method provides for treating a man with a pulsating

<CLAIMS>
A method of protecting man from artificial radiation, which consists in treating
him with a low-frequency electromagnetic field, distinct in the low-frequency

electromagnetic field oscillation frequency being the same as the frequency of the
Shuman wave vibrations.
A device for protecting man from artificial radiation, containing a low-frequency
signal generator, with the outlet connected to a transmitting antenna, distinct in

the generator being capable of emitting electromagnetic oscillations at the Shuman
wave vibration frequency, and the device being equipped with a logical bloc to

adjust the electromagnetic emission intensity of the device, while the comparator
outlet is connected to the input of the logical bloc.
