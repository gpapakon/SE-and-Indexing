<ABSTRACT>
A radio frequency moisture meter comprises an elongate body (10) with a first electrode (A) at one end and a second electrode (B) along the bottom of the body (10) and spaced from the electrode (A). Electrical circuitry mounted within the body (10) is operable to apply a radio frequency voltage between electrodes (A and B). Circuitry within the body (10) is also arranged to sense the impedance between the electrodes (A and B) and to drive a display (12) which indicates the impedance sensed. In use of the instrument, the body is held so that the electrode (A) is close to the surface of the material to be tested and so that the electrode (B) is further from that surface. The impedance thus measured between electrodes (A and B) provides a measure of the moisture content of the material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method of and 
device for measuring the moisture content of a material. It is well known that a measure of moisture in 
materials can be obtained by measuring the electrical 
properties of the material, namely electrical resistance, 
capacitance, radio frequency (rf) admittance or impedance, 
etc. In the case of resistance measurement usually two 
pins, used as electrodes, are pushed into materials like 
wood, plaster and other porous building materials or, 
indeed, materials such as those used for building boats 
like GRP laminate. A disadvantage of the last-noted 
arrangement is that pin holes are left behind after 
measurement. Another type of instrument used for measuring 
moisture control of materials uses rf capacitance 
measurement. Usually an instrument of this type utilises 
two electrodes mounted on a flat surface. The electrodes 
have a radio frequency oscillator connected to them and the 
near-field capacitance is measured. Higher moisture 
contents showing higher capacitance readings and vice 
versa. 
   This technique has a number of disadvantages as follows: 
a) a relatively large area needs to be presented to 
the surface and to be in good contact with it for reliable 
measurements. Rough surfaces cause measurement problems; b) as the measurement is made between flat 
electrodes on the same plane any "skin" moisture close to 
the electrodes will have a predominant effect on the 
measurement. Thus, a laminate several millimetres thick 
with condensate or other water film on the face will show  
 
an extremely high reading which is not a true indication of 
the total water content of the laminate. Instruments of the above-noted types, and their 
uses, are discussed in the publication "The Professionals 
and Home Owners Guide to Dampness in Buildings" by T.A. 
Oxley and E.G. Gobert (1983) published by Butterworths. US-A-4468610 discloses apparatus for measuring the 
moisture content of test pieces of gypsum board in which 
the capacitative impedance to a radio-frequency signal 
presented by an antenna disposed adjacent such a test piece 
is measured to provide an indication of the moisture 
content of the test piece. It is an object of the invention to provide a novel 
method and apparatus for measuring moisture content which 
overcomes the above-noted problems of known instruments. According to one aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a method of measuring the moisture content of a 
mass of material, comprising providing antenna means, 
arranging
