<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed code recording apparatus can record 
broadcasted interframe prediction-coded code trains on a 

storage medium in such a way that pictorial images of smooth 
motion can be reproduced from the storage medium at a high 

speed search. When the code trains of high efficiently coded 
moving pictorial images are broadcasted, the prediction code 

trains prediction-coded between frames or fields are decoded 
by a decoding circuit to obtain reproduced images. The 

obtained reproduced images are coded independently in frame 
or field to form independent code trains decodable 

independently. Further, a part of the prediction code train 
is replaced with the independent code train obtained by the 

coding circuit by a code replacing circuit. The code trains 
thus obtained are recorded in the storage medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording apparatus
such as VTR for recording moving pictorial images, and more
specifically a code recording apparatus for recording code
trains of moving pictorial images coded on the basis of frame
or interframe prediction when these code trains are
broadcasted or transmitted.In opposition to analog signal broadcasting systems such
as NTSC system, for instance, it has been studied such a
digital signal broadcasting system that moving pictorial image
information is converted into digital signals through a high
efficiency encoding method and the obtained digital code
trains are broadcasted as satellite broadcasting, ground wave
broadcasting, CATV, etc.Where the image information broadcasted as described
above is required to be recorded by use of a VTR, for
instance, if the video signals equivalent to the ordinary NTSC
system can be obtained by decoding the received compressed
code trains perfectly, it is also possible to record the
obtained video signal information by use of home use VTR of
VHS system now being used widely.On the other hand, in the case of the VTR for recording
digital video signals, although it is possible to record the
video signals by first decoding the code trains into
reproduced video signals as described above and then encoding
the reproduced video signals again.However, it is also to consider another method of
recording the code trains as they are, and then decoding the
recorded code trains for reproduction. This recording method 
is rational, because the video signals can be reproduced
without deteriorating the picture quality due to recording and
without use of any additional encoding apparatus.In the case of the storage medium such as a video tape,
however, it is necessary to reproduce the video signals for
high speed search, that is, to display picture at high speed
so that the viewer can search the picture while seeing it.
In this case, a part of the picture is eliminated and the
eliminated picture is displayed at high speed. In the case
of the home use VTR in practice, the tracks along which video
signals are recorded are read obliquely with reproducing
heads, with the result that one field is divided into several
sub-fields in the horizontal direction and different parts of
the divided sub-fields of the several different fields are
displayed, respectively at the same time. Further, in the
case of a video disk, only one field within several fields is
displayed.In the case of the recording media for digital
information using a high
