<CLAIMS>
A process for the metathesis of olefins, employing a rhenium
catalyst, characterised in that said catalyst comprises a

support containing at least 75% by weight of alumina, 0.01 to
20% by weight of rhenium in oxide form and 0.01 to 30% by

weight of at least one oxide of a metal selected from the group
consisting of niobium and tantalum.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
catalyst is obtained from a catalytic composition formed from

at least one porous support containing at least 75% by weight
of alumina, a compound of at least one metal selected from the

group consisting of niobium and tantalum, and at least one
rhenium compound, said composition being activated in a non-reducing

atmosphere.
A process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that at least one element selected from the group consisting of

alkali metals and alkaline earth metals is also present.
A process according to Claim 2, in which the niobium compound
is selected from the group consisting of halides, oxyhalides,

alkoxides, hydrated oxides complexed by oxalic acid, hydrated
oxides complexed by tartaric acid and ammonium salts of said

acids.
A process according to Claim 2, in which the tantalum compound
is selected from the group consisting of halides, oxyhalides,

alkoxides, hydrated oxides complexed by oxalic acid, hydrated
oxides complexed by tartaric acid and ammonium salts of said

acids. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the rhenium compound belongs to the group consisting of rhenium

heptoxide, ammonium perrhenate and perrhenic acid.
A process according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the porous support is alumina with a porosity which is at least

equal to 0.1 ml/g and with a surface area which is at least

equal to 10 m
2
/g.
A process according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the catalyst is prepared by introducing onto the support the

compound metal selected from the group consisting of niobium
and tantalum, and then by introducing the rhenium compound.
A process according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the metathesis reaction is carried out in liquid phase at a

temperature of between 0 and 200 Â°C, and at a pressure which is
at least equal to the vapour pressure of the reaction medium at

the reaction temperature.
A process according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the olefins of the metathesis reaction are selected from the

group consisting of linear olefins and cyclic olefins.
