 WOUND HEALING O3 PCS---TI0NS CCW AINING A PYRUVATE, AN ANTIOXIDANT AND A MIXTURE OF FATTY ACIDSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of application serial no. 663,500, filed 1 March 1991.1. Field of the InventionThis invention pertains to therapeutic wound healing compositions useful for increasing the proliferation and resuscitation rate of mammalian cells. More particularly, the wound healing compositions comprise (a) pyruvate, (b) an antioxidant, and (c) a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. This invention also pertains to methods for preparing and using the wound healing compositions and the topical pharmaceutical products in which the therapeutic compositions may be used.2. Description of the BackgroundWounds are bodily injuries caused by physical means which disrupt the normal continuity of structures. Such bodily injuries include contusions, wounds in which 

 the skin is unbroken, incisions, wounds in which the skin is broken by a cutting instrument, and lacerations, wounds in which the skin is broken by a dull or blunt instrument. Wounds may be caused by accidents or by surgical procedures. Patients who suffer major wounds could benefit from an enhancement in the wound healing process.Wound healing consists of a series of processes whereby injured tissue is repaired, specialized tissue is regenerated, and new tissue is reorganized into a scar. Wound healing consists of three major phases: a) an inflammation phase (0-3 days) , b) a cellular proliferation phase (3-12 days) , and (c) a remodeling phase (3 days-6 months) .During the inflammation phase, platelet aggregation and clotting form a matrix which traps plasma proteins and blood cells to induce the influx of various types of cells. During the cellular proliferation phase, new connective or granulation tissue and blood vessels are formed. During the remodeling phase, granulation tissue is replaced by a network of collagen and elastin fibers leading to the formation of scar tissue.When cells are injured or killed as a result of a wound, a wound healing step is desirable to resuscitate the injured cells and produce new cells to replace the dead cells. The healing process requires the reversal of cytotoxicity, the suppression of inflammation, and the stimulation of cellular viability and proliferation. Wounds require low levels of oxygen in the initial stages of healing to suppress oxidative damage and higher levels of oxygen in the later stages of healing to promote collagen formation by
