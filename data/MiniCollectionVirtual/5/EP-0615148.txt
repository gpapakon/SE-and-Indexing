<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for polarising light, by means of which an unpolarised light beam (15) is split into two light beams (16, 17) which are linearly polarised perpendicularly to one another, and subsequently one of these linearly polarised light beams (17) is rotated into the polarisation direction of the other light beam (16) and spatially superposed this light beam (16) in order to obtain a linearly polarised light beam of high intensity.
