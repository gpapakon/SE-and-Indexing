<ABSTRACT>
An atraumatic retraction 
device (10) for use in laparoscopic surgery. The inflatable medical 

device may be inserted into the patient's abdomen through a small 
incision, inflated for use to retract an internal organ, then deflated 

and removed at the conclusion of the surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an atraumatic retraction 
device for use in laparoscopic surgery. In particular, the 
invention relates to an inflatable medical device which may 
be inserted into the patient's abdomen through a small 
incision, inflated for use to retract an internal organ, 
then deflated and removed at the conclusion of the surgery. Surgery on abdominal organs has traditionally been 
conducted through a single standard incision in the 
patient's abdomen. This technique is known as open surgery. 
During the last several years, less traumatic techniques 
have been developed to treat abdominal ailments, including 
laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is performed through very small 
incisions in the abdomen, usually only 5 to 12mm. The 
abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide (CO²) -- a harmless 
gas -- in order to expand the abdominal cavity to provide a 
space to perform the surgery. A laparoscope containing a 
camera inserted through a small incision in the navel 
enables the surgeon to inspect the inside of the abdomen on  
 
a television monitor. The entire surgery is conducted by 
the surgeon manipulating specially designed instruments 
which protrude into the abdomen through several other small 
incisions while the surgeon views the procedure on the 
television monitor. This minimally invasive surgical technique has several 
advantages over traditional open surgery. Laparoscopic 
surgery usually takes less time than a comparable open 
surgery. Because no muscles are cut and only small incision 
are made, the patient is likely to experience less post-operative 
pain than from open surgery. The recovery time in 
the hospital, and therefore the cost, is often less. 
Furthermore, when the tiny incisions heal, the scars may be 
nearly invisible, instead of a long abdominal scar which 
usually results from open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery, however, is still quite new and 
efficient retraction of abdominal organs has been 
challenging. One typical complication which often occurs 
during laparoscopic surgery is injury or hemorrhaging caused 
by contact of a surgical instrument against a fragile organ 
such as the liver or spleen. Mechanical retraction devices 
are often the cause of such trauma. The small incisions 
through which laparoscopic surgery is performed severely 
limits the size and shape of retraction devices which may be 
used. Retraction devices currently used in laparoscopic 
surgery include mechanically expandable devices such as the  
 
three-pronged liver retractor
