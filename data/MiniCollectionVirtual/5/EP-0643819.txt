<ABSTRACT>
Cold storage apparatus comprises a vessel (1) containing a storage liquid and a heat transfer liquid in direct contact with the storage liquid to transfer heat thereto or therefrom. The liquids are immiscible and of different densities and the heat transfer liquid remains liquid during heat transfer. The storage liquid comprises a liquid which solidifies when sufficiently cooled by the heat transfer liquid and the solidified storage liquid is of a different density to the storage liquid. The liquids form by gravity sequentially within the vessel (1) a first layer (4) of heat transfer liquid, a second layer (3) of storage liquid and a third layer (2) of solidified storage liquid. The cold storage apparatus includes heat transfer liquid circulating means (6) to deliver the heat transfer liquid to and from vessel (1). The heat transfer liquid circulating means (6) is arranged to deliver the heat transfer liquid into the first or second layer (4) or (3) at a temperature below the freezing point of the storage liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cold storage 
apparatus and in particular to ice storage apparatus. Ice storage provides the means to shift 
electrical load for cooling for instance air 
conditioning systems. As shown in Figure 1, during 
off peak periods the chiller plant runs to charge up 
the ice store and then during peak periods (day time 
periods) the store can be used to provide some or all 
of the buildings' cooling requirements. Much work has been done in developing an 
efficient means of providing cold storage in the form 
of ice store. An efficient cold storage method for 
producing ice uses a direct contact evaporator. Such 
an arrangement is disclosed in US 4864831. In this 
arrangement a refrigerant is brought into direct 
contact with water in a tank to form ice which is used 
for heat exchange to provide chilled water for use in 
air conditioning. The refrigerant is sprayed onto or 
into the water and evaporates to absorb its latent heat 
of evaporation from the water, thus forming ice. The 
evaporating gaseous refrigerant is then condensed and 
recirculated. Although this method has an advantage of 
direct contact between the refrigerant (heat transfer 
fluid) and the water (storage liquid), it is important 
to ensure that no water vapour is carried over with the 
refrigerant vapour to the compressor if conventional 
compressors are to be used. Otherwise, 
non-conventional compressors must be used. GB-A-2053434 discloses cold storage apparatus 
comprising a vessel containing a storage liquid and a 
heat transfer liquid in direct contact with said 
storage liquid to transfer heat thereto or therefrom, 
said liquids being immiscible and of different  
 
densities, said heat transfer liquid remaining liquid 
during heat transfer, said storage liquid comprising a 
liquid which solidifies when sufficiently cooled by 
said heat transfer liquid, the solidified storage 
liquid having a different density to said storage 
liquid, said liquids forming by gravity sequentially 
within said vessel a first layer of said heat transfer 
liquid, a second layer of said storage liquid, and a 
third layer of said solidified storage liquid; said 
cold storage apparatus including heat transfer liquid 
circulating means arranged to circulate said heat 
transfer liquid from and back to said vessel and to 
cool said heat transfer liquid to a temperature below 
the freezing point of said storage liquid. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a direct contact cold storage apparatus which 
avoids the
