<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor optical amplifier which has a good extinction
ratio and a simple structure includes an optical waveguide having at least

a curved portion. The optical waveguide has light input and output ends
offset from each other to keep optical fibers out of alignment with each

other at respective opposite ends of the optical waveguide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of optical
communications, and more particularly a semiconductor optical amplifier
for amplifying and extinguishing signal light.Semiconductor optical amplifiers (hereinafter referred to as
"SOA") are devices having an optical amplifying medium in the form of a
striped optical waveguide, that is. "an active stripe". The SOA amplifies
for amplifying signal light without converting it into an electric signal.SOAs have a structure that is basically the same as
semiconductor lasers. However. SOAs have device ends covered with
anti-reflecting coatings to reduce their light reflectances, so that SOAs
are not of an optical resonator structure.Therefore, even when a carrier is injected. SOAs suppress
laser oscillation, but outputs amplified light due to stimulated emission
in response to input signal light.SOAs are reported in various documents including:
(1) I. Cha. et. al., Electr. Lett. Vol. 25. pp 1241 - 1242
(1989);(2) C. E. Zah, et. al., Electr. Lett. Vol. 23. pp 990 - 991
(1987);(3) S. Kitamura. et. al., IEEE Photonics Technol. Lett. Vol.
7. pp 147 - 148 (1995); (4) L. F. Tiemei jer. 0AA '94. Technical Digest 34/WD1-1 (1994) ;(5) P. Doussiere. et. al., ECOC '96. Proceeding Vol. 3, Wed
2.4 (1996); and(6) S. Chelles, et. al.. ECOC '96, Proceeding Vol. 4, ThB 2.5
(1996).The documents (4) - (6) even disclose a modularization of an
SOA and optical fibers, and report that the gain between the optical fibers
can be of 20 dB or higher, and the saturated output of amplified signal
light is of nearly 10 dBm.SOAs function as a carrier-injected optical gate as well as
a device for amplifying signal light.Specifically, the active stripe of an SOA amplifies signal
light when it is turned on, i.e., when a current is injected into the active
stripe. and exhibits a high light absorption capability when it is turned
off, i.e., when no current is injected into the active stripe. Therefore.
the optical waveguide with the active stripe serving as a core layer thereof
is capable of turning on and off guided light.Strong demand is predicted for optical matrix switches for
signal light cross connect applications in future optical communication
networks. SOAs are currently most promising for use as optical gate elements
of such optical matrix switches.The extinction ratio of SOAs at the time they are turned on
and off is larger than that of electro-absorption semiconductor modulators
or optical directional coupler switches. Therefore, if optical matrix switches are constructed using
SOAs
