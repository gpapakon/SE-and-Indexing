<ABSTRACT>
The method of the present invention is for 
recording, reproducing, and deleting information on and 

from an optical disk including a plurality of tracks each 
having M guide grooves (M is an integer equal to or 

larger than 2) and M-1 land(s) interposed between the 
adjacent guide grooves, at least one of the land(s) 

having a group of pits for producing address information. 
The method includes the step of: focusing light beams on 

the respective guide grooves and land(s) for effecting 
the recording, reproduction, and deletion of information. 

Such an optical disk is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk
and the like set in an optical disk unit, and a method
for recording, reproducing, and deleting information on
and from such an optical disk.In recent years, rewritable optical disks have
been studied and developed. As a result, some rewritable
optical disks have already been put into practical use as
external memories for computers. Such conventional
optical disks have spiral guide grooves formed thereon,
and groups of groove-shaped pits are formed on spaces
between the adjacent guide grooves (hereinafter, such
spaces are called lands). Information is recorded on, or
reproduced or deleted from the optical disk by focusing
a light beam on the land between the guide grooves.
Positional ineormation indicating the position on the
optical disk is produced by the arrangement of each group
of pits, so that the light beam can be guided to a target
position on the optical disk.In order to increase the recording density of the
optical disk, Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-27610
proposes to record information on both the guide grooves
and the lands, both of which have widths that are made
substantially the same. In this proposed method, however,
since only one light beam is used for the guide
grooves and the lands to effect the recording, reproduction,
and deletion of information, the data transfer rate
will not be improved compared with the preceding optical 
disks. Further, the above prior art does not describe
how the light beam accesses a target position except for
the mention of using an address signal.In order to improve the data transfer rate, a
multibeam method where information is recorded, reproduced,
and deleted by using a plurality of light beams
has been vigorously studied. Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 3-214428, for example, proposes to
provide one unit of address information for a plurality
of tracks.Figure 4 of "Development of High Speed Magneto-optical
Disk Drive Using 4 Beam Optical Head" (Paper of
Electronic Information Communications Society, Sep. 25,
1990, MR90 31, pp. 37-44) discloses the structure of an
optical disk where information is recorded, reproduced,
and deleted by using a plurality of light beams. According
to this disclosure, a guide groove at a pitch of 6 Âµm
and groups of pits (Preformat IDs) arranged parallel to
the guide groove are formed on the optical disk. An
array of four light beams are positicned inclined with
regard to the guide groove. One of the four light beams
moves on the guide groove irradiating the
