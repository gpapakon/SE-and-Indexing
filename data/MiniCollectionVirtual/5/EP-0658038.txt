<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus comprises receiving means 
for receiving the image data, storage means for storing 

the image data received by the receiving means, sub-address 
receiving means for receiving a sub-address 

signal, processing storage means for storing a 
processing correspondin
g to the content of the sub-address 
signal, and processing means for checking to 

determine whether or not the content of the sub-address 
signal received by the sub-address receiving 

means and the content of the sub-address signal stored 
in the processing storage means are matched, and if 

matched, executing a processing corresponding to the 
content of the sub-address signal on the received image 

data stored in the storage means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile
apparatus and a communication control method having a
sub-address function.Also, the invention relates to a facsimile
apparatus and a facsimile communication method having
a sub-address function or a password function which is
an additional function in CCITT (International Telegraph
and Telephone Consultative Committee) recommendation/T.30.In CCITT SG8 meeting held in April, 1993, it has
been determined that the sub-address, the password, and
the selective polling function is additionally recommended.
Herein, the recommendation regarding the sub-address
involves notifying the presence or absence of a sub-address
receiving function to the transmitter in terms
of bit 49 of a DIS/DTC signal, and sending 20-digit
information with a SUB signal when the sender designates
the sub-address.Since the presence or absence of the receiving
function of a sub-address signal can be designated in
terms of the DIS signal, the SUB signal (sub-address
signal) can be transmitted or received between other
manufacturer's stations. Accordingly, the communication 
between the self station and other manufacturer's
station had a significant drawback that if the
operation based on the SUB signal in the receiver end
is different from the operation based on the SUB signal
in the sender end, the communication based on the sub-address
information can not be correctly executed,
causing a malfunction.Also, the communication between the same
manufacturer's stations had a further drawback that
different settings of using the SUB signal between the
sender end and the receiver end would result in a
malfunction.Document US-A 5 251 044 discloses a facsimile apparatus that
provides a charge management system in which beneficiaries are charged
costs of expendable supplies in accordance with the amounts they have spent.This document discloses means for identifying a receiver and for
detecting, accumulating and storing consumption amounts. However, this
document does not deals with the problem of communications between stations
whose settings of using the sub-address signal are different.It is an object of the present invention to provide a communication
apparatus which can make a communication based on a sub-address
information, even between apparatuses whose settings of using the sub-address
signal are different. It is an object of the present invention to
define a method of using the sub-address signal in the
facsimile apparatus.It is another object of the invention to provide
a facsimile apparatus
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus comprising:

receiving means far receiving image data;
sub-address signal receiving means for receiving a
sub-address signal;
maker code discriminating means for discriminating
a maker code in a standard procedure signal;
telephone number discriminating means for
discriminating a telephone number of a sending partner; and
processing means for carrying out a processing
specified by a received sub-address signal, the processing

being carried out, in dependence on the telephone number or
maker code to ensure that the communication apparatus

carries out the processing even where the sending partner
and said communication apparatus ascribe different

processings to the sub-address signal itself.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
sub-address signal includes a command-code, and said

processing means carries out the processing in accordance
with the command-code.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said
process is a process using a parameter, and said sub-address

signal includes a processing command and the parameter.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising processing storage means for storing processings

corresponding to a plurality of sub-address signals.
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said
processing storage means stores a different processing for

the process of each sub-address signal.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
processing means inhibits recording image data on a

recording sheet based on the control of the sub-address
signal.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising setting means for setting a time band, and time

discriminating means for discriminating whether or not a
time is within the time band set by said setting means,

wherein said Processing means performs a processing in
accordance with the received sub-address signal and the

discriminating result by said time discriminating means.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
setting means sets said time band for each day of the week.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising operation means for instructing said processing

means to perform or inhibit a processing using the sub-address
received with an operation of an operator.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising storage means for storing the image data received

by said receiving means, wherein said processing means
processes the received data stored in said storage means in

accordance with the sub-address signal.
An apparatus according to claim 10, further
comprising sending means for sending the received image data

stored in said storage means, wherein said processing means
causes said sending means to send the received image data

stored in said storage means in accordance with the sub-address
signal.
