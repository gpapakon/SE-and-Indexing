<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to antibodies which are 
specifically immunoreactive with forms of crosslinks 

which occur free in biological fluids. Methods to 
assess connective tissue, especially bone, metabolism 

in disease or to monitor therapy are also disclosed. 
Such methods comprise assessing the levels of native 

free collagen-derived crosslinks in biological fluids, 
especially urine. The method can be enhanced by 

concomitantly determining the levels of an indicator 
of bone formation in biological fluids of the same 

individual and assessing the differences between the 
degradation marker and the formation indicator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods of diagnosis
in medical and veterinary contexts. More specifically,
it concerns methods to assess bone and other connective
tissue metabolism by detecting free crosslinks formed by
collagen degradation in biological fluid samples, such as urine.The association of collagen as a major
structural material in a multiplicity of tissues,
including bone, cartilage, skin, tendons, dentine and
various soft tissues is well known. It is also known
that the fiber structure of collagen is stabilized by
crosslinking. The presence of the fluorescent pyridinium
ring system as a non-reducible crosslink in collagen was
reported by Fujimoto, D., et al., J Biochem (1978)
83:863-867. The Fujimoto paper reported isolation of a
fluorescent peptide from pronase digestion of bovine
Achilles tendon collagen. The isolated hydrolyzed
pyridinoline (Pyd) was thought to contain three residues
of hydroxylysine and it was recognized that, prior to
hydrolysis, peptide fragments were attached to the
pyridinoline moiety. Further work on characterization
was conducted by Gunja-Smith, Z., et al., Biochem J
(1981) 197:759-762, Using hydrolyzed urine, and advantage
was taken of the presence of the pyridinoline in urine by
Robins, S.P., Biochem J (1982) 207:617-620, who linked 
pyridinoline obtained from hydrolyzed urine to a carrier
to raise antibodies. The antibodies were then employed
in an immunoassay to determine the concentration of
pyridinoline in hydrolyzed urine. The procedure was
stated by Robins as useful to provide an index of the
degradation of certain forms of mature collagen by
analysis of physiological fluids.In all of the foregoing, hydrolyzates were
employed to obtain total pyridinoline since much of the
crosslink retained peptide extensions of the hydroxylysyl
residues responsible for its formation. Thus, in order
to obtain a homogenous preparation containing the
pyridinium ring, a preliminary hydrolysis step was
necessary.By 1982, it was established that there were two
pathways of crosslink formation depending on whether
lysine or hydroxylysine residues were present in the
telopeptides from which these crosslinks were derived
(Robins, S.P., in "Collagen in Health and Disease" (1982)
Weiss, J.B., et al., eds., pages 160-178, Churchill
Livingstone, Edinburgh). This was stated to result in a
specificity of crosslinking whereby in soft tissues, such
as skin, reducible aldimine linkages are formed from
oxidized lysyl residues, whereas in cartilage and bone
these bonds, initially formed from
