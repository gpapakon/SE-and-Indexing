<ABSTRACT>
A flat panel display device having formed on a drive 
substrate, a logic circuit for combining a first 

inspection-use output of a horizontal scanning circuit and 
a second inspection-use output of a vertical scanning 

circuit and a combined inspection-use output terminal for 
outputting the combined inspection-use output obtained 

through the logic circuit. Another flat panel display 
device of the present invention has switch circuits for 

using a first input terminal of the horizontal scanning 
circuit as an inspection-use output terminal of the 

vertical scanning circuit and using a second input 
terminal of the vertical scanning circuit as an 

inspection-use output terminal of the horizontal scanning 
circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat panel display
device and a method of inspection of the same, more
particularly relates to a flat panel display device, an
active matrix drive substrate, and methods of inspection
of the same which enable the number of output terminals
used for the inspection of the horizontal scanning circuit
and the vertical scanning circuit formed on the drive
substrate of a liquid crystal display device, for example,
to be slashed and the inspection time to be shortened.A representative type of a flat panel display device
is a liquid crystal device (LCD). A LCD generally is
comprised of a drive substrate on which a horizontal
scanning circuit, vertical scanning circuit, and a pixel
region are formed, a counter substrate on which counter
electrode is formed, and a liquid crystal sealed between
the two. The pixel region has a plurality
of picture elements
in a matrix array. Each picture element has a pixel
electrode and a drive circuit. The drive circuits are, for
example, comprised of switch elements, and are driven for 
each picture element selected by the horizontal scanning
circuit and the vertical scanning circuit to cause an
optical change in the portion of the liquid crystal
corresponding to each picture element and thereby display
an image.The above-mentioned horizontal scanning circuit and
vertical scanning circuit can be formed on a substrate
separate from the drive substrate on which the pixel drive
circuits are formed, but the trend is for formation on the
same drive substrate due to the demands for greater
compactness of the device etc.In the process of production of an LCD, various
inspection processes are required at each stage of the
production. For example, one of these is the inspection of
the operation of the horizontal scanning circuit and the
vertical scanning circuit. If these circuits do not both
operate normally, the finished LCD will also not operate
normally.Therefore, in the prior art, provision was made of an
inspection-use output terminal for each of the horizontal
scanning circuit and the vertical scanning circuit (a
total of two inspection-use output terminals), these
circuits were independently made to operate after the
production of the drive substrate or after the assembly of
the drive substrate and the counter substrate and the 
filling of the liquid crystal, the output waveforms were
taken out from the output terminals, and the inspections
were performed using the same. That is, in the
conventional method of inspection, it was considered that
