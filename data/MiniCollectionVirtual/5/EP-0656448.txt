<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an equipment for storing rainwater falling on a roof or a rooftop 
of a house or used water from a bathtub. Three water tanks (11 to 13) are stacked one on another 

in a position below rain gutters (14). The rain gutters and a first water tank (11) are connected 
to each other by a first supply channel (21), and a second supply channel (22) is connected to its 

one end to the lower surface of the first water tank (11) and is provided at the other end thereof 
with a supply valve (33). A third supply channel (23) provided with a check valve (43) is connected 

at its one end to lower surfaces of the second and third water tanks (12, 13), respectively, and 
is connected at the other end thereof to the second supply channel. When rainwater stored in the 

first and second water tanks reaches predetermined water levels, respectively, amounts of rainwater above the predetermined water 
levels are conducted to the second and third water tanks, respectively, by an overflow channel (41). 

Rain water is collected in order in the tanks with the first water tank (11) first, 
and rainwater in the tanks is supplied in order to destinations being supplied starting with 

the first water tank (11). The equipment can be installed in a relatively small 
space and relatively readily increase or decrease its water storage capacity by increasing 

or decreasing the number of the water tanks, and can supply collected rainwater 

to destinations, where water is needed, as water for miscellaneous use by the utilization 
of potential energy of rainwater in the water tanks without providing a pump.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an equipment for storing a
rainwater dropping on a roof of a house or a housetop and a used
water of a bathtub, more precisely relates to a general service
water storing equipment utilizing a stored water as a general
service water such as a sprinkle water over a garden, a washing
water for a car, a flushing water for a toilet and the like.Up to now, in order to utilize effectively a rainwater,
there is started to be conducted a method of storing the
rainwater in a ground storage vessel disposed on a ground or an
underground storage vessel embedded under the ground, and
supplying this stored rainwater to a required place as a general
service water by means of a pump.On the other hand, in order to utilize effectively the used
water of the bathtub, this water is supplied to a washing machine
by means of a portable pump of small size or a bucket to be
utilized as a washing water for clothes.However, according to the above mentioned method of
utilizing the rainwater, there is caused a problem that it is
difficult to ensure a place of arranging a storage vessel in the
region in which houses are crowded as a city portion. Also,
there is a disadvantage of increasing a running cost, because the
stored rainwater must be supplied by using the pump.Moreover, the above mentioned method of utilizing the used
water of the bathtub, it requires a much labor, and the ratio of
utilizing the used water is not sufficient yet because the water 
remained in the washing machine which is not utilized as the
washing water is discarded.It is therefore the first object of the present invention to
provide a general service water storing equipment in which it can
be arranged on relatively narrow space, a water storage capacity
can be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the
capacity of a storage vessel according to the required amount of
the general service water, and the stored rainwater can be
supplied to the required place as the general service water
without a power source such as a pump and the like by utilizing a
potential energy of the rainwater in the storage vessel.It is therefore the second object of the present invention
to provide a general service water storing equipment in which the
used water of a bathtub can be supplied to the required place as
the general service water by storing the used water of the
bathtub in a storage vessel by a pump to utilize a potential
energy of the used water in the storage vessel, thereby utilizing
the used water of the bathtub effectively.These
