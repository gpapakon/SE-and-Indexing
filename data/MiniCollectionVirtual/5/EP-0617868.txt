<ABSTRACT>
Fault tolerant topology for passive optical networks essentially based on a ''tree configuration'' with branch points or nodes (16, 17) made up of passive optical splitters, in which each node (16, 17) of a specific level is connected to the same number of nodes (16, 17) of the level immediately below by two or more branches (Rd, Rs) and a supplementary connection (S1, S2...) is provided between each pair of nodes of the same level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns transmission systems using optical 
fibres and, in particular, optical networks of passive type 
structured in such a way as to be highly tolerant to faults 
affecting the transmission mean, that is, the fibre. The passive optical fibre networks, that is, those 
containing no active inner components such as switches, 
bypasses, modems, and so on, provide very high information 
exchange speeds - up to a rate of around one terabit per 
second, using, for example, the WDM (Wavelength Division 
Multiplexing) technique. The present application makes particular reference to 
passive optical networks for use in the so-called 
Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN). However, the invention is 
not limited to this type of application. As we know, if we have to obtain total interconnectivity 
between stations linked by an optical network, the most 
frequently used mappings are based on star, bus and tree 
configurations or a suitable combination of these. Star mapping is inconvenient from the point of view of the 
fibre installation costs, while the bus configuration is 
extremely limited with regard to the power budget that is 
the quantity of optical power that can be carried. Tree mapping, whose limitations with regard to fibre 
installation costs and power budget are much less serious, 
does present the problem of being extremely fault-prone. If 
we take a metropolitan network as an example, we can see 
that a cut in one single fibre can completely disconnect an 
extensive part of a network with tree structure.  
 To overcome this problem, the use of redundant architecture 
and the insertion of suitable active elements in the 
network nodes have been suggested, to handle for example 
the signal routing or its amplification by alternative 
multiple routes contained in the network architecture. In 
this way, however, it is no longer possible to obtain the 
very high communication Bit rate (terabit/sec approx.) 
which can be obtained only by using optical networks 
realized with a completely passive physical mapping. The document from the IEEE Military Communications 
Conference "Enhanced Network Survivability Through 
Balanced Resource Criticality" - M.A. Schroeder - vol, 1, 
October 1989, New York, US pages 682-687 discloses a 
tepological survivability for military networks in which 
all node and link resources are of equal importance. 
Additional four links are foreseen to assess how close a 
network design comes to being maximally survivable, without 
however to solve the problem of
