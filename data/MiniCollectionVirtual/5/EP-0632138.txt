<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method of manufacturing a high toughness
and high strength untempered steel having the mechanical
properties equivalent to or better than those of tempered steel
and more particularly, the high
toughness and high strength untempered steel having either the
tensile strength higher than 75kgf/mm2 with the impact toughness
higher than 7kgf-m/cm2 in the KS 3 specimen, or the tensile
strength higher than 90kgf/mm2 with the impact toughness higher
than 5kgf-m/cm2 in the KS 3 specimen. Generally, the untempered steel means the steel which can
exhibit the satisfactory mechanical properties in the
work-hardened state without heat-treatments such as
quenching-annealing and normalizing. However, since the
toughness of untempered steel is extremely low compared to that
of the tempered steel, its use has been limited to the crank
shafts or other simple applications where the toughness is not
considered as the important property.Particularly, as pointed out in Japanese Patent
Publication No.89-211606 or Japanese Patent Publication
No.83-53709 or US-P 4.851.054 since the conventional untempered steel exhibits
its good mechanical properties only in the products with small
diameter or this plate but not in the products with large diameter, there
have been many problems for the actual applications. Moreover,
as indicated in US-P 4.141.761, Japanese Patent Publication No.79-66322,
Japanese Patent Publication No.83-167751 and Japanese Patent
Publication No.86-56235, the low-carbon and high-alloy steel
has been developed, but it has been problematic in that the
induction heat-treatment cannot be performed on the steel. EP-A-487.250 discloses an object to improve the measureability
and induction hardenability of steel, but not to improve
the high strength, high toughness and electroplating characteristic.EP-A-301.228 teaches a steel, wherein V is selectively added
and N is below 0.0050%. The object in this document is to improve
only the strength, but not the high strength and high
toughness.CA-A-942.541 discloses also a steel with the object to accomplish
the ferrite pearlite texture, but it does not concern
the toughness, the pearlite grain size or ferrite fraction.
In addition the strength is relatively low and the charpy
impact value Is also low.Patent Abstracts of Japan and JP-A-2.153.042 teaches a low
carbon high toughness untempered steel, wherein the compostion
scope is smaller than in the present invention.EP-A-85 828 discloses a steel wherein in comparison to the present
