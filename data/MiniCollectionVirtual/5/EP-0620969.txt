<ABSTRACT>
A livestock sorting system (10) is provided 
with an entrance (11) having an identification sensor 

(13-15) for identifying designated livestock passing 
therethrough, and first and second aisles (18, 20) extending 

from the entrance. A gate (52) has a first 
position (FIG. 2) providing communication of the entrance 

with the first aisle, and a second position (FIG. 3) 
providing communication of the entrance with the second 

aisle. An automatic control actuates the gate between 
the first and second positions in response to the identification 

sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to livestock handling
systems, and more particularly to automated sorting
systems for herd management and the like.The invention arose during continuing development
efforts directed toward sorting systems for a dairy
farm or the like. It is desired to sort cows or other
animals which have been identified for particular
attention, monitoring, feeding, medical attention,
etc.British Patent Application No. GB-A-2053343
describes a livestock sorting system comprising:
an entrance having an identification sensor for
identifying designated livestock passing therethrough;a first aisle extending from said entrance;a second aisle extending from said entrance;a gate having a first position providing
communication of said entrance with said first aisle
and blocking communication of said entrance with said
second aisle, and having a second position providing
communication of said entrance with said second aisle
and blocking communication of said entrance with said
first aisle;an actuator actuating said gate between said
first and second positions; andan automatic control for automatically
controlling actuation of said gate by said actuator
between said first and second positions in response to
said identification sensor.In accordance with a first aspect of the present
invention there is provided a livestock sorting system
of the above type, characterized in that said system
further comprises:
a differential speed mechanism, moving said gate
from said first position to said second position 
faster than return movement of said gate from said
second position to said first position, such that said
gate moves fast enough to said second position to
divert even fast moving livestock to said second
aisle, and such that the slower return movement of
said gate back to said first position allows the
livestock sufficient time to pass into said second
aisle without harm, and wherein said slower movement
of said gate to said first position gently nudges and
completes the movement of slower moving livestock into
said second aisle.In accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention the livestock sorting system comprises:
an exit switch responsive to livestock passing
through said second aisle and providing an off state
signal to said actuator to actuate said gate to said
first position; characterised in that said system
further comprises:an on-cycle timer responsive to said
identification sensor when identified designated
livestock passes through said entrance and providing
an on state signal to said

(11);
a gate (52) having a first position providing
communication of said entrance (11) with said first

aisle (18) and blocking communication of said entrance
(11) with said second aisle (20), and having a second

position providing communication of said entrance (11)
with said second aisle (20) and blocking communication

of said entrance (11) with said first aisle (18);

that said gate (52) moves fast enough to said second
position to divert even fast moving livestock to said

second aisle (20), and such that the slower return
movement of said gate (52) back to said first position

allows the livestock sufficient time to pass into said
second aisle (20) without harm, and wherein said

slower movement of said gate (52) to said first
position gently nudges and completes the movement of 

slower moving livestock into said second aisle (20).

outputs said on state signal to said actuator (84),
such that if an identified designated livestock animal

trips said exit switch (94) during an on state signal
caused by an immediately trailing identified

designated livestock animal having passed through said
entrance (11), then said gate (52) will remain in said

second position, and not move to said first position,
whereby to enable two or more successive designated

livestock animals to be sorted out and diverted to
said second aisle (20).
