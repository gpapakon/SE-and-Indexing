<ABSTRACT>
A system of navigation that derives the velocity vector 
without the use of an inertial navigation system (INS). 

The system uses the motion of the scene viewed by the 
imager in the imager's field of view (FOV) in order to 

calculate the aircraft velocity. The motion of the 
image points in the FOV due to the motion of the 

aircraft is referred to as the optical flow. It is well 
known that the optical flow from a single imager can 

provide the velocity components only to within a global 
scale factor. There is provided input data from a 

second sensor that enables calculation of the scale 
factor such that the velocity magnitude and direction 

is known on an absolute scale. This second sensor may 
also be part of the typical aircraft sensor suite.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system of navigation for use in a
mobile vehicle as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.Such a system is described in Proceedings of the 12th Canadian
Symposium on Remote Sensing IGARSS 89, Remote Sensing: "An
Economic Tool for the Nineties", by S. Negahdaripour, July 10 -
14, 1989, Vancouver, Canada, Vol. 3, pp. 1264 - 1266. In this
article, monocular motion stereo navigation schemes are
described which are based on optical flow determination.EP-A 436 213 concerns a system incorporating inertial sensor
information into optical flow computations to detect obstacles
and to provide alternative navigational paths free from
obstacles. This known system is a maximally passive obstacle
detection system that makes selective use of an active sensor.GB-A 2 212 687 relates to an aircraft navigation system that
uses an infra-red scanner to provide an image of the ground, and
a laser doppler system to measure the speed of the aircraft
relative to the ground.The present invention, the most essential features of which are
described in claim 1, pertains to aircraft guidance systems for
mobile vehicles, primarily aircraft, that utilize image data
available from onboard image sensors. Many aircraft applications
involve the use of a passive imaging sensor in order to
accomplish the mission objectives. In addition to providing
image data that pertains to the primary use of the imager, the
fact that the imager is carried onboard can be exploited to aid
in navigating the aircraft. Generally aircraft navigation
requires an inertial navigation system (INS) in order to 
determine its position with respect to some inertial reference
frame. INS systems are extremely costly due to their mechanical
and electronic complexity, and they impose a payload penalty on
the aircraft in terms of size, weight, and power.The presence onboard of an imaging sensor provides image data
that can be processed to derive information about the aircraft
attitude and velocity, which can be further processed to derive
the aircraft position in a defined reference frame.According to the invention, there is provided a system of
navigation 
that derives the velocity vector without the use of an
INS. The system uses the motion of the scene viewed by
the imager in the imager's field of view (FOV) in order
to calculate the aircraft velocity. The motion of the
image points in the FOV due to the motion of the
aircraft is referred to as the optical flow. It is well
known that the optical flow from a single imager can
provide the
