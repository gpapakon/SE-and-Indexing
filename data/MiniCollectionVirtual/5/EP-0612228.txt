<ABSTRACT>
A flexible three-lumen catheter provided with a balloon (7) carries a sealingly sheathed radiofrequency radiating antenna (1), together with the shielded power supply cable and with some thermocouples (6,6',6''), within a plastic lining (27) surrounded by a flow of liquid; a second lumen (5) carries the power supply cables of some outer thermocouples, flooded by the reverse liquid flow, while the third lumen (8) allows a fluid to flow through for inflating the balloon. Introduction of the catheter into a hollow organ (32) makes it possible to perform hyperthermal therapy of tumors by means of radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a radiating device for hyperthermia 
and, more particularly, a radiofrequency radiating 
device, for hyperthermal treatment of tumors of the 
bladder. Devices for hyperthermal treatment of various human body 
illnesses are already known, and they use heating 
liquids, light radiations, radiofrequency antennas, 
thermistors, and so on. US Patent No. 4 776 334 describes a catheter for treating 
tumors by inserting within the tumor to be treated 
a radiofrequency device provided with temperature 
sensors. French patent application 2600205 concerns an apparatus 
for light irradiation of a cavity with the help of an 
inflatable balloon and of light sensors. In US patent No. 4 154 246 there is described a radio-frequency 
resonating circuit which is introduced in 
natural cavities of the body or directly inserted into 
the tumoral mass. German patent application No. 2 848 636 claims usage of 
a heated liquid which is circulated in a closed loop by 
means of a pump within a body cavity, wherein the liquid 
temperature is controlled by an external thermostat.  
 EP-A-0 370 890 discloses a radiating urethral device 
for hyperthermia including a catheter provided with an 
inflatable balloon and adapted to receive one or more 
liquid flows passing therethrough, a radiofrequency 
radiating antenna, and one or more thermocouples, the 
radiating antenna being submerged within one said 
liquid flow coming back from the closed terminal end of 
the antenna. The radiating device comprises in addition 
a separate rectal control means. GB-A-2 045 620 relates to an applicator for 
hyperthermia comprising a rectal radiating probe and a 
spaced apart transurethral catheter including a 
temperature sensing means and an inflatable balloon. US-A-4 967 765 discloses a transurethral radiating 
applicator for hyperthermia including a multi-tube, 
balloon type catheter comprising closed and tubes 
respectively surrounding a helical coil antenna and a 
temperature sensor, as well as a passive drainage tube 
for urine. It is an object of this invention to provide a device  
 
for hyperthermal treatment of tumors within natural 
cavities of the human body, which gathers the advantages 
of the known devices while being free from their drawbacks. The device according to this invention substantially 
comprises a flexible triple path catheter carrying a 
radiofrequency radiating antenna, sealingly sheathed 
together with the shielded cable providing power supply 
and with several thermocouples within a plastic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A radiating device for urethral hyperthermia 
including a catheter provided at its distal end with an 

inflatable balloon (7) and adapted to receive several injected 
liquid flows (2,5,8) passing therethrough, a radiofrequency 

radiating antenna (1) and at least one thermocouple 
(6,6',6''), the radiating antenna being submerged 

within said liquid flow, characterized in that
 
   said radiating antenna (1) is submerged within a 

liquid flow which proceeds through a central channel (2) 
surrounding said radiating antenna (1) towards the distal 

end of said catheter and passes from said catheter 
through a first opening (3) into the bladder to be treated, 

while flowing back into said catheter towards the 
proximal end thereof through a second separate opening 

(4) of a side channel (5) surrounding the power supply 
cables of said thermocouples (6,6',6''),
 
   the ends of said thermocouples (6,6',6'') project 

out of said second opening (4), being thus deflected 
outwards into the bladder when said balloon (7) is inflated 

by injecting a fluid therein through a second side 
channel (8) and third opening (9), whereby the outwardly 

deflected ends of said thermocouples (6,6',6'') come into 
tangential engagement with the bladder wall (32) irradiated 

by said antenna (1).
