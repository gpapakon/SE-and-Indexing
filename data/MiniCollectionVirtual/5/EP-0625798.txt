<ABSTRACT>
An opto-electronic integrated circuit is arranged to 
comprise a photodetector (100) and a tunnel emitter bipolar 

transistor (210₁) for first-stage amplification of a 
current generated in the photodetector (100), as formed on 

a substrate (300). The tunnel emitter bipolar transistor 
(210₁) can be operated at hi
gh speed and has a high 
amplification factor, so that noise due to the base current 

can be reduced upon amplification of the current generated 
in the photodetector (100) by light detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opto-electronic
integrated circuit used for example in optical fiber
communication, for receiving light and converting it into
electric signals.With development of optical fiber communication
optical receivers used in the field are required to have
high-speed operability. In order to satisfy this
requirement of high-speed operability and to achieve
miniaturization, there have been studied and
experimentally produced various opto-electronic
integrated circuits composed of a combination of a
photodetector and transistors. A typical example of such
opto-electronic integrated circuits is one including a
light receiving circuit composed of a pin photodiode and
hetero-junction bipolar transistors as described in "S.
Chandrasekhar, et al.: IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett., Vol.
3, No. 9, 1991, pp. 823-825".Figs. 1 and 2 are structural drawings of the opto-electronic
integrated circuit. Fig. 1 is a circuit
structural drawing, and Fig. 2 is a table to indicate
materials for forming the pin photodiode and hetero-junction 
junction bipolar transistors (hereinafter referred to as
HBT). As shown, the opto-electronic integrated circuit
is so arranged that the pin photodiode and HBT
constituting a photodetector are formed, utilizing the
hetero junction of InP and InGaAs, on a semi-insulating
substrate made of an InP crystal. The chemical beam
epitaxy process is used to form the hetero junction
layer. The opto-electronic integrated circuit as so
arranged is one for receiving light, having
characteristics of cut-off frequency (fT)=32 GHz and
maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX)=28 GHz and being
operable at 5 Gb/s for light of wavelength=1.5 µm.Further, S. Chandrasekhar et al. gave a report on an
opto-electronic integrated circuit for receiving light,
having almost the same structure as that of the above
opto-electronic integrated circuit, formed using the
MOMBE process, and being operable at 10 Gb/s for light of
wavelength=1.53 µm (S. Chandrasekhar, et al.: Electronics
Letters, Vol. 28, 1992, pp. 466-468).An equivalent input noise spectral density (N(f)) of
opto-electronic integrated circuit can be expressed by
the following formula (T. V. Muoi, IEEE/OSA Journal of
Lightwave Technology, Vol. LT-2, No. 3, 1984, pp. 243-267).
N(f)=4kT/RF+2eIb+2eIc(2πCT)2/gm2+4kTrbb'(2πCdsf)2f2
where N(f): equivalent input noise spectral density; 
f : frequency;k : Boltzmann's constant; T : absolute temperature;RF : feedback resistance;e : elementary charge;Ib : base current;Ic : collector current; CT : total
