<ABSTRACT>
An engaging part provided on a loader which has 
shifted a holder carrying thereon a disc cartridge to a 

reproducing/recording position, engages with a mechanical 
lock mechanism so as to release a holder pin in said 

mechanical lock mechanism from its locked condition in 
order to hold a movable chassis in a floating condition 

with respect to a stationary chassis. On the contrary, 
the engaging part on the loader locks the holding pin in 

the mechanical lock mechanism so as to fix movable 
chassis to the stationary chassis when the holder has 

been shifted to the cartridge ejecting side. When the 
holder is moved to the reproducing/recording position, 

the holding pin provided on the holder engages with a 
shutter closing spring so as to retract an engaging part 

at the front end of the shutter closing spring through an 
opening in the holder in order to prevent the disc 

cartridge from making contact with the shutter closing 
spring, thereby it is possible to make the feeling of 

insertion of the disc cartridge satisfactory, and to 
avoid damaging the disc cartridge. Further, a rack in a 

loader feed mechanism is composed of two rack members 
which are linked together so as to decrease the operating 

length for moving the loader is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc apparatus for
reproducing and writing data on a data recording disc in a
photomagnetic recording type minidisc cartridge.Disc cartridges in which a data recording disc is
housed in a protecting cartridge (which will hereinbelow
be denoted simply as the "cartridge" have been proposed.
A photomagnetic recording type minidisc cartridge as one
example of this kind of cartridge, is shown in Fig. 11.
The cartridge 100 incorporates a cartridge casing 101, a
data recording disc 102 housed in the cartridge casing
101, a disc access hole 103 formed in one side of the
cartridge casing 101, and a slide shutter 104 for opening
and closing the disc access hole. Further, cartridge
gripping recesses 105 are formed at the left and right
sides on the front side of the rear surface of the
cartridge casing 101, and a longitudinal groove 106 is
formed in the right end face of the cartridge casing 101
and receives a shutter engaging member (which is not
shown) in its intermediate part. The shutter engaging
member is urged toward the groove 106 by a spring (which
is not shown), that is, it can be retracted. Further, the
shutter engaging member is linked to the above-mentioned
slide shutter 104.Further, data is recorded on or reproduced from the
cartridge by means of a disc apparatus in which an optical
pick-up records or reproduces data while moving radially
of the data recording disc 102 with a predetermined gap
between the optical pick-up and the data recording disc
102, and accordingly, it is necessary to shut-out 
vibration transmitted from the outside. Thus, a movable
chassis (suspension chassis) for holding the optical pick-up
is supported in a floating condition on a stationary
chassis by means of resilient members. Further, the
movable chassis is normally fixed to the stationary
chassis by means of a lock mechanism which does not
comprise part of a loading mechanism, except when the disc
cartridge is set at a position other than a
recording/reproducing position.However, the above-mentioned conventional disc
apparatus suffers a problem, in which the lock mechanism
being directly coupled with the loading mechanism is not
moved, and accordingly, if the timing of the operation of
the lock mechanism becomes out of phase the movable
chassis cannot be precisely positioned.A disc apparatus employing a locking mechanism for
locking the moveable chassis is disclosed in EP-A-0145
052. This apparatus comprises a disc apparatus comprising
a stationary chassis; a movable chassis supported on
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disc apparatus comprising a stationary chassis
(1); a movable chassis (2) supported on said stationary

chassis (1) by means of resilient means (28) and carrying
thereon a turntable and a pick up; a lock pin (30,31)

provided on said movable chassis; a mechanical lock
mechanism (A) provided on said stationary chassis, for

releasably gripping said lock pin so as to fix said
movable chassis to said stationary chassis; a holder (43)

provided movably on said movable chassis, for holding a
disc cartridge (100) thereon and for loading and ejecting

said disc cartridge; and a loader (68) provided on the
stationary chassis, for conveying said holder in a

predetermined conveying direction; characterised in that a
pin actuating means (74) is provided on said loader, and

is adapted to interfere with said mechanical lock
mechanism at an end of a loading operation of said disc

cartridge, for causing said mechanical lock mechanism to
release said holder pin from its locked condition, and

adapted to interfere with said mechanical lock mechanism
at a start of an ejecting operation of said cartridge, for

causing said mechanical lock mechanism to lock said lock
pin.
A disc apparatus as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said escape mechanism comprises a holding pin

(51a) holding a shutter opener (49), and adapted to
interfere with a shutter closing spring (56) so as to

retract an engaging part (56b) of said shutter closing
spring from a cartridge insertion part (58) through 

an opening (514) when said holder (43) is positioned on
the cartridge introducing side.
