The sensor apparatus of the present invention includes on a nonconducting substrate (11) electrically conductive pathways (20, 22, 24) leading to at least two analyte electrodes (32, 34) and one reference electrode (36). The analyte electrodes (32, 34) each have sensitivities for both analytes but each has a membrane (48, 52) and/or electrolyte (50, 54) that favors the conversion of ionic potential to electronic potential for a different analyte. The apparatus has a fluid circuit means (68) for liquid contact between the electrodes (32, 34, 36) so that electric signals can be sent by electric circuitry (16) to an analyzing means (116). The analyzing means (116) determines the values of the analytes from simultaneously mathematical relationships.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANALYTE AND PH MEASURING SENSOR ASSEMBLY AND METHODThe present invention is related to an analyte sensor assembly apparatus and method for measuring coupled analytes. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus of a carbon dioxide and pH sensor assembly for measuring both in fluid samples. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNumerous methods and apparatus exist in the art for measuring chemical components of fluids and current technology utilizes many types of sensors for detecting components and analytes in numerous types of fluids. For example, carbon dioxide and pH sensors are used for measuring these components in various fluids including gases and liquids. For instance, the measurement of blood gases, along with the pH from a sample of arterial blood, gives the state of the acid base balance or the effectiveness of both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the human or vertebrate body. Measuring the blood gases usually involves a measurement of the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide along with the measurement of the pH since carbon dioxide dissolved in the aqueous solution can affect the pH through the presence of carbonic acid. These are examples of coupled analytes. It is conventional practice in many of the existing measurement methods, even where the fluid is a liquid or liquid with a dissolved gas with or without the presence of solids to transport a sample to a central location for testing. With centralized testing, the bulky, stationary, elaborate and sophisticated equipment performs the analysis on a practically endless number of samples. Originally, this equipment employed carbon dioxide sensor like the Severinghaus 

 potentiometric sensor for a qualitative and/or quantitative measure of carbon dioxide. This sensor has a gas-permeable membrane between the sample solution for measurement and the measuring cell. The cell has a pH-sensing glass electrode, a reference electrode, and an intermediate electrolyte layer. Recently, more sophisticated carbon dioxide sensors have utilized polymeric membranes like those of the combined pH and carbon dioxide sensor of U.S. Patent 4,818,361.Also, recent attempts have been made to introduce more portable equipment into the marketplace of fluid analysis. An example of this is the qualitative and/or quantitative measurement of constituents or analytes of blood. The bulky stationary equipment is fairly expensive and the procedures for its use can be cumbersome depending on the type of fluid to be measured. For instance,
