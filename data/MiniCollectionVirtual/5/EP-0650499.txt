<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing partially methylated cyclodextrines in an aqueous medium from a cyclodextrine such as alpha-cyclodextrine, beta-cyclodextrine or gamma-cyclodextrine, or from a salt of said cyclodextrines, which is reacted with dimethyl sulphate and a base, preferably an alkaline metal hydroxide, is characterised in that the methylation reaction is carried out in the presence additionally of at least one substance having an affinity for the cyclodextrine cavity, such that an inclusion complex with the said substance may form during the methylation reaction. Partially methylated cyclodextrines obtained by this method are also disclosed.
