<ABSTRACT>
Can bodies are produced by rounding a sheet-metal blank into a tube shape and welding it along the edges in contact with one another. The sheet is generally coated at the same time on what will be the inside to make it possible, for example, for it to hold food. However, there must be no coating where the weld is produced because, otherwise, the welding process may be affected in a disadvantageous way. Accordingly, the coating must be applied to the sheet-metal coil in a form corresponding to the subsequent can format, as a film for example, and this is expensive. According to the invention, the coating is applied in the correct format immediately before the welding process, allowing the coating to be applied continuously in an amount just sufficient and to the extent required to meet the current demand.
