<ABSTRACT>
The method for the image assisted position determination and map plotting of underground objects near to the surface, using an optical measuring system and optical standard bodies also geophysical sensors, for determining, evaluating and interpretation of geophysical data. A mobile measuring system (MS) with a highly exact direction finder (PV) in conjunction with a precise surveying platform and optical standard bodies (ONK1-ONKn) carries out a continuous, plane exact and three dimensional above earth positional determination. The relative position of the coordinate systems of the direction finder, optical standard bodies and the carrier vehicle (TFZ) are determined continuously, which simultaneously precisely represent under earth objects, determined by the sensors, also underground as well as above ground data. A system control processes and stores input data and transmits and indicates this on digital amp system in corresp. form.
