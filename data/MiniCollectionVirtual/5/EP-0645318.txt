<ABSTRACT>
The capping system for bottles containing still 
water comprises a bottle neck (5) on which an 

internally-threaded cap (2) is inserted, which 
neck develops truncoconically and in which a 

minimum angle α between a tangent of an upper 
surface (1a) of the thread (1) and a line 

perpendicular to a bottle axis, measured in an 
anticlockwise direction, is greater than an angle 

β between a tangent of a lower surface (1b) of the 
thread (1) and a line perpendicular to the bottle 

axis, measured in a clockwise direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a capping system for 
bottles containing still water. For some considerable time now plastic bottles 
capped with a plastic cap have been used for the 
above purpose. The caps used are of various types 
and almost all exhibit a safety collar, generally 
constituted by a detachable strip attached to the 
cap which is detached when the bottle is opened 
for the first time, thus guaranteeing that the 
bottle has not been tampered with in any way. A first type of such caps is pressure-inserted on 
the bottle neck, closing the bottle mouth. This 
type is not a favourite with consumers since the 
bottle is both difficult to open and to close. Another common type is the screw-on cap which 
couples with the bottle by means of one thread 
internal of the cap and another external of the 
bottle neck. Though much favoured by consumers, 
this type of cap causes problems in the bottling 
plant, since automatic machines have to be  
 
predisposed to perform the screwing-on operation 
and therefore have to incorporate more complex 
devices than those needed for a simple pressure-insertion 
of the cap on the bottle neck. Whereas a 
screw-cap represents a guarantee against loss of 
pressure for bottles containing gassy liquids, 
where still liquids are concerned this is not a 
problem, so the choice of using a screw-on cap for 
still liquids is made with the consumers' 
preference in mind. The present invention aims to obviate the above-mentioned 
problems by providing a capping system 
for bottles containing still water which employs 
simple and rapid automatic machines for capping 
the bottles and which provides a simple screw-on 
and off operation for the consumer. A further aim of the invention is to provide a 
capping system wherein the cap, like many known-type 
caps, is made in a single piece and exhibits 
a safety strip. An advantage of the capping system is that the 
bottle can be capped by automatic machines both 
simply and rapidly and without the need to use 
lubricants which sometimes have to added to the 
plastic materials to enhance machine operability.  The use of such lubricants, especially for bottles 
containing still water, is not fully acceptable as 
they might infiltrate into the water and affect 
its taste. These and other advantages besides are all 
attained by the invention, as it is characterised 
in the claims, which comprises a threaded bottled 
neck on which an internally-threaded cap is 
inserted, said bottle neck thread developing over 
a truncoconical tract and

<CLAIMS>
A capping system for bottles containing still 
water, of the type comprising: 

a neck (5) defining a bottle mouth, which neck (5) 
is externally provided with a thread (1) 

exhibiting an upper surface (1a) and a lower 
surface (1b); 

an internally threaded cap (2) incorporating a 
safety strip (3) coupling with the bottle neck (5) 

and detaching from the cap (2) when the bottle is 
first opened; 

characterised in that: 
a minimum angle between a tangent of the upper 

surface of the thread and a perpendicular line to 
the axis of the bottle (measured in an 

anticlockwise direction) is greater that an angle 
between the tangent of the lower surface of the 

thread and a perpendicular line to the bottle 
axis, measured in a clockwise direction. 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that a minimum difference between the angle α and 

 
the angle β is comprised between 5 degrees and 30 

degrees. 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that: the upper surface (1a) of the thread (1) is 

curved and exhibits a minimum angle α of about 30 
degrees at a connection point between the upper 

surface (1a) and a surface of the bottle neck (5); 
the angle β being constant and being of about 20 

degrees. 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that: the surface of the bottle neck (5) whereat 

the thread (1) develops is upwardly truncoconical; 
the internal surface of the cap (2) whereat the 

thread of the cap developing truncoconically in a 
same way thereas. 
A capping system as in claim 4, characterised in 
that the cone angle δ of the external surface of 

the neck (5) is between 1 degree and five degrees. 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that the thread (1) exhibits a plurality of 

starts. 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that the cap (2) exhibits a length which is about 

a third of a diameter thereof. 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that the cap (2) exhibits a sealing ring (7) 

arranged internally of an upper surface thereof 
and disposed such as to insert on the bottle neck 

(5); said sealing ring (7) being coaxial to the 
cap (2) and having a maximum external diameter 

which is slightly greater than an internal 
diameter of said bottle neck (5).
 
A capping system as in claim 1, characterised in 
that: the upper surface (1a) of the thread (1) is 

curved and exhibits a minimum angle α which is of 
about 30 degrees, ata connection between the upper 

surface (1a) and a bottle neck surface; angle β 
being constant and of about 20 degrees; the 

surface of the bottle neck (5) whereat the thread 
(1) develops being upwardly truncoconical with a 

cone angle δ of about 3 degrees; the internal 
surface whereat the cap (3) thread develops being 

truncoconical to an equal degree as the cone angle 
δ of the bottle neck surface; the thread (1) 

 
exhibiting four thread starts; the cap exhibiting 

a length which is about a third as long as a 
diameter thereof; the cap (2) also exhibiting a 

sealing ring (7) arranged internally thererof in 
such a position as to insert in the bottle neck, 

and being coaxial to the cap (2), and exhibiting a 
maximum external diameter which is slightly
