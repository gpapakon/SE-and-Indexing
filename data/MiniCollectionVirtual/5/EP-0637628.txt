<ABSTRACT>
A nonionic loaded powder detergent composition which
is free-flowing is manufactured and agglomerated in a

single operation by mixing sodium carbonate, a di- or
tricarboxylic acid and a nonionic surfactant to form a

nonaqueous slurry. Water is then added to the slurry to
solubilize portions of the sodium carbonate and the di-

or tricarboxylic acid which allows them to react to form
a builder salt in the slurry. Silica is then added to

the slurry to form a flowable or nearly flowable powder
detergent mixture. A second portion of sodium carbonate

may be added after the silica.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making
a free-flowing agglomerated powder detergent containing
high levels of nonionic surfactant.Most granular detergents are produced by spray
drying. This process involves mixing detergent
components such as surfactants and builders with water to
form a slurry which is then sprayed into a high
temperature air stream to evaporate excess water and to
form bead-type hollow particles. While spray drying the
detergent slurry produces a hollow granular detergent
having an excellent solubility, extremely large amounts
of heat energy are needed to remove the large amounts of
water present in the slurry. Another disadvantage of the
spray drying process is that because large scale
production equipment is required, a large initial
investment is necessary. Further, because the granules
obtained by spray drying have a low bulk density, the
granule packaging volume is large which increases costs
and paper waste. Also, the flowability and appearance of
the granules obtained by spray drying is poor because of
the presence of large irregularities on the surface of
the granules.In addition to these characteristic processing and
product problems associated with the spray drying
process, volatile materials, such as nonionic
surfactants, are emitted into the air when processed by
this method with the other detergent components. This
volatilization problem, manifested by the discharge of
dense "blue" smoke from the spray tower, is referred to
as "plumbing." Air pollution standards limit the opacity
of the plume. Consequently, it is necessary to limit the
capacity of the spray tower or, in extreme instances, 
discontinue operation.Other suggested methods call for post-dosing the
product with nonionic surfactant after the spray drying
operation. Unfortunately, post-dosing of the spray dried
base with surfactant in amounts sufficient to provide
satisfactory wash performance generally results in poor
flowing, aesthetically displeasing products.
Accordingly, the amount of surfactant that may be
employed in the detergent formulation is severely
limited. Because heavy-duty laundry detergents need
large amounts of nonionic surfactant present, inorganic
silicates have been added to these detergent formulations
to absorb the nonionic liquids.US-A-3 769 222 describes mixing liquid nonionic
surfactants with sodium carbonate until partial
solidification occurs followed by the addition of large
amounts of silica (silicon dioxide) to produce a dry
free-flowing detergent composition. A
