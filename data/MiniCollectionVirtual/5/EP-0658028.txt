<ABSTRACT>
The throughput of a radio transmission link is enhanced by arranging a 
transmitter of data packets so that it responds to the transmission window closing by 

repeatedly retransmitting all unacknowledged data packets and doing so until the 
window reopens or a receiver status message acknowledges receipt of a 

retransmitted data packet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to data packet retransmission
arrangements for use in a communications system.It is well-known that wireless transmission is noisy and typically suffers
from deep fades, which may last up to several hundreds of milliseconds. As such, it
is likely that data packets transmitted over a wireless transmission link during
adverse transmission conditions will need to be retransmitted one or more times. It
can be appreciated that frequent retransmission of data packets decreases the
throughput of a wireless transmission link. It can also be appreciated that stopping
the retransmission of data packets whenever the transmission window closes also
decreases such throughput.Moreover, in a reverse mode (from a host receiver to a user transmitter)
information that is transmitted from the host to the user is often preempted by a
status packet noting which packets were received correctly and/or incorrectly by the
receiver. As such, the bandwidth of the reverse transmission path that may be used
for the transmission of information is decreased by the transmission of status
packets. In some applications, such a decrease may be acceptable. However, when a
high level of sustained duplex throughput is required, then such a decrease may not
be acceptable. EP-A-0055404 describes a method and system for communicating digital
data from a first station to a second station. Source and destination stations
continuously transmit data frames at fixed intervals substantially synchronized to one
another. Each data frame transmitted by the destination station may include a source
station identification number and a positive or negative acknowledgement to indicate
whether or not the identified source station data frame was correctly received by the
destination station. The source station then interprets the destination station data frame
to determine whether it is necessary to transmit any previously transmitted data frames.US-A-5222061 describes a facility for use in a packet switch to control
unnecessary multiple retransmission of a data packet. Control is achieved by tracking
in a list the sequence numbers of transmitted data packets and retransmitting a data
packet only if its sequence number appears in the list prior to the sequence number of
the last data packet that is received correctly by a receiver. The sequence number
associated with a retransmitted data packet is deleted from the list and then appended to
the list to place the number in proper relationship with the sequence numbers of data
packets
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A data packet retransmission arrangement for use in a communications
system comprising:


means (100) for transmitting data packets to a receiver (200) and associating
said transmitted data packets with respective transmit order numbers as they are

transmitted,
means (100, 120), responsive to receipt of a status message identifying the
transmitted data packets that were received correctly and incorrectly by said receiver,

for retransmitting whenever a window for transmitting data packets is open only those
of said incorrectly received data packets whose associated transmit order numbers

precede a transmit order number associated with a transmitted data packet identified in
said message as being the last of the correctly received data packets, and
CHARACTERIZED BY
:

means (100, 120), operative whenever a window for transmitting data packets
closes, for retransmitting, in turn, all unacknowledged data packets that have been

received incorrectly or not at all by said receiver when said window was open and
continuously repeating the retransmission of each such data packet until either said

window opens for the transmitting of data packets or receipt of a confirmation indicates
that the data packet was received correctly.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein said status message is
a full status message comprising at least a bit map field, a field identifying the last data

packet correctly received and a field identifying the last data packet correctly received in
proper sequence, said bit map field being formed from a number of bits associated with

respective sequence numbers that are appended to respective ones of said data packets in
the order that said data packets are transmitted.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2 wherein said status message
may also be a partial status message inserted in a user information packet, said partial

status message comprising at least (a) a bit map field formed from a group of bits
assoc
iated with a group of respective sequence numbers assigned to respective ones of a
group of data packets in the order that said group of data packets are transmitted and (b) 

a group number defining a relationship between said group of sequence numbers and
another group of sequence numbers.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 3 wherein said partial status
message comprises a field identifying the last data packet received correctly and in

proper sequence.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein said communications
system is a wireless telephone system.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein said transmission
window is of a given size that may allow some data packets to be newly transmitted

before closing.
