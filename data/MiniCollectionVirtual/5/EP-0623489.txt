<ABSTRACT>
A simplified adjusting mechanism (20) for adjusting the 
aiming of a headlamp assembly (22) in automobiles and the like 

includes a gear encircling a bushing (32) and an adjustor screw (30) 
that is journaled through the bushing (32). The adjustor 

mechanism (20) is snapped into a stationary component (26) of the 
headlamp assembly (22) and the aiming of the headlamp is manually 

adjusted by using a drive tool. The adjustor mechanism (22) has 
a series of indication lines that allow the user to adjust 

the aiming of the headlamp assembly (22) back to its desired 
position if the headlamp assembly (22) becomes misaligned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to mechanisms 
for adjusting the aiming of a headlamp assembly in 
automobiles and the like. The invention more specifically 
relates to a novel adjustor mechanism that can be snapped 
into a stationary component of the headlamp assembly, and 
employed to control the position of a relatively movable 
component, such as the reflector or the entire headlamp 
housing. Following assembly of an automobile, the headlamps must 
be set to their desired position. This is generally 
accomplished by use of sophisticated photometric metering 
equipment and manually adjusting the headlamps until the 
headlamps point in the desired location. Adjustment is 
usually accomplished by using an adjustor mechanism of the 
general type and kind to which the present invention 
relates. Also, due to vibration or an accident, the headlamps may 
move out of the desired aiming location. With certain prior 
art adjustor mechanisms, there is no way to attain the 
desired initial position or alignment without use of 
specialized equipment. With the present invention, the  
 
initial or "zero" position of the movable headlamp component 
is indicated and the operator need only adjust the position 
of the headlamp by using the adjustor mechanism to move the 
headlamp back to its initial or "zero" position. Adjustor mechanisms for adjusting the aiming of a 
headlamp to a desired location are well-known in the art. 
Examples of an existing prior art adjustor mechanisms can 
be found in United States Patent Nos. 5,121,303; 5,067,052; 
5,032,964; 4,674,018; 4,893,219 and 4,939,945, and generally 
uses an adjusting screw or a gear box that consists of a 
pair of gears, a housing, caps, bushing, washer, and 
adjusting screws or shafts. These mechanisms require 
several assembly steps and several ultrasonic welding 
operations which increase the cost of the mechanism. An headlamp adjustment assembly according to the preamble of 
claim 1 is known from US-A-4 893 219. The present invention comprises an adjusting mechanism 
for adjusting the aiming of a headlamp assembly in 
automobiles and the like that has fewer parts and requires 
fewer steps to assemble. The adjustor mechanism generally 
includes a bushing that is encircled by a gear and an 
adjustor screw that is journaled through the bushing. The 
adjustor mechanism is snapped into a stationary component of 
the headlamp assembly and the aiming of the headlamp is 
manually adjusted by using a drive tool. In a preferred 
embodiment, a series of
