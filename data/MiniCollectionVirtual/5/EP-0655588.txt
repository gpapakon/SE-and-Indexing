<ABSTRACT>
Shower apparatus (1) heated by solar radiation (3) used in open spaces, 
made of any type of material, and installed in a substantially vertical position, 

which comprises the structural configuration of the apparatus in addition to act 
as accumulation container (2) of water heated by sunbeams (3), so that the 

vertical cylinder (2) made of rigid material is used both as an accumulator 
storage of hot water and as a carrier structure for the apparatus. The storage 

cylinder may be coated with a protection cover which avoids the cooling 
produced by ambient air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a shower apparatus,
which takes advantage of the solar heat and
environmental temperature in order to heat the water which is used
in open spaces, such as pools, gardens , chalets, campings, etc.This type of shower uses a rigid cylinder as heating recipient upon which
solar beams fall directly which provide the heating supply onto the water
contained in the same. The cylinder is installed at a more or less vertical
position for which a plate is attached to the lower part thereof which serves as
support and fixing means of the cylinder at the place where the shower is
installed. At the upper end of the cylinder a water pulverizer or atomizer with
adjustable inclination is installed by means of a hose. Said pulverizer is
supplied directly from the water contained in the cylinder and/or also directly
from the water maintenance installations. The selection or mixing of each
supply channel is carried out by means of valves installed at the vertical side
of the cylinder together with the corresponding pipings. All of which is protected
inside a longitudinal protector attached to the cylinder and in vertical position.
The grips of the valves, situated outside said housing allow for the adjustment
and selection of cold and/or hot water.Furthermore, said shower apparatus has connection for the water supply
piping, and cylinder emptying plug in order to avoid deterioration due to frost in
winter time.For a higher efficiency in obtaining heat from the solar beams, use is
made, in the construction of the apparatus, from materials of high thermal
conductivity and high resistance against climatic erosion and corrosion caused
by waters.The cylinder-recipient may be provided by a protecting cover which
prevents the cooling of the contained water caused by the environmental air. The products used in the manufacturing of the cylinder-deposit are rigid
materials and conductors of heating energy, such as for example, aluminium-magnesium,
which is capable of gaining not only the solar heat, but the
environmental heat while the materials used in the existing solar gainers only
gain the solar energy and not the environmental energy since they are hot water
accumullators.The reason for using materials such as those mentioned hereinabove,
for example, aluminium-magnesium is to obtain an excellent efficiency during
the day-time activity hours in gardens, pools, etc, for which the present
invention is not based upon what is normally known in relation to storage and
accumulating hot

<CLAIMS>
Use of shower apparatus for heating water contained therein, in open
spaces, by means of solar radiation and / or environmental temperature said

shower apparatus comprising a cylindrical water recipient (2) for storage of
water, connected to a water supply and having means (5) for pulverizing water

during use, said apparatus being installed in a substantially vertical position,
the water recipient (2) being constructed from a rigid and

highly thermally conductive material which is used for absorbing heat from solar
radiation as well as environmental temperature, said cylindrical water recipient

(2) supporting the structure of the shower apparatus (1).
Use of shower apparatus according to the previous claim, characterised
in that the highly thermally conductive material used for constructing said water

recipient is an aluminum-magnesium alloy.
Use of shower apparatus according to the previous claims, characterised
in that the material of high thermal conductivity is formed so as to be used for

providing high resistance against erosion and corrosion.
Use of shower apparatus according to the previous claims, characterised
in that after the water in the recipient (2) is heated, a protecting cover is

used to cover the cylindrical water recipient in order to prevent refrigeration by
the cooler enviromental air.
Use of shower apparatus according to the previous claims, characterised
in that an entry for cold water (7) and two channels of cold and hot water (6),

and valves (8) for mixing the content of each channel are used in order to select
or adjust the temperature of the water to be used in the shower (1).
Use of shower apparatus according to the previous claims, characterised
in that it uses an emptying plug for the cylindrical water recipient (2) in order to

empty water from the latter.
