<ABSTRACT>
The two halves of the mold (M) are closed between a fixed and movable platen by a cylinder. The reaction to the force exerted by the piston rod is taken by a bolster that is held in position by clamps. To change the gap (a) available for the mold, the clamps are released and a clamp on the cylinder support is closed so that the cylinder can be used to move the bolster to a new position. Instead of a hydraulic cylinder (25), a rotary screw drive can be used. The clamps (13) can be split nuts engaged hydraulically on a screw thread and the clamp (14) a hydraulically operated split collet.
