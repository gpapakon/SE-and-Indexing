<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic composition for the skin or superficial 
body growths, comprising a dispersion of solid organic 

particles in a binder, characterized in that at least a 
portion of the said organic particles are introduced into 

the said composition in the form of particles whose 
surface is coated with at least one cationic polymer. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the said cationic polymer is chosen from those 

comprising units which contain primary, secondary, 
tertiary and/or quaternary amine groups. 
Composition according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said amine groups form part of the polymer 

chain. 
Composition according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said amine groups are carried by a side 

substituent. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said cationic polymers 

have a quaternization value, expressed as cationic 
equivalents per gram of polymer, of at least 

0.05 cationic meq/g. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said cationic polymers 

contain at least 10% by weight of units comprising amine 
or quaternary ammonium groups. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the proportion by weight of 

cationic polymers, relative to the total weight of the 
coated particles, is at least equal to 0.1%. 
Composition according to the preceding claim,  
 

characterized in that the said proportion is less than 
10% and in particular less than 8%. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the binder is chosen from 

fats (oils and/or waxes) and film-forming polymers. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterized in that it is provided in the form 

of a compacted powder, a cast powder, a lipstick or a 
nail varnish. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that it is provided in the form of an 

emulsion of water-in-oil or oil-in-water type. 
Use, in the preparation of a cosmetic composition 
for the skin or superficial body growths containing a 

dispersion of solid organic particles in a binder, of 
organic particles whose surface is coated with at least 

one cationic polymer. 
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized 
in that the said cationic polymer or the said 

binder is as defined in any one of Claims 2 to 9.
