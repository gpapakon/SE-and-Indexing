Device according to one of Claims 1 - 87, characterized in that the
at least one rail treating element (34; 140, 158) is produced from

metal such as steel, brass, cast metal or a polymeric material or a
felt.
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 88, characterized in that the
guide rail (110) has at least one lateral surface (110f) with a cross-sectionally

trapezoidal profile depression, the flanks of this profile
depression forming tracks (110k) each of which is for an endless

circuit of rollers (116, 118) and in that on the at least one rail
treating element (140) there is a correspondingly trapezoidal

projection the flanks (142) of which are intended to cooperate
with said tracks (110k) of said depression.
Device according to one of Claims 66 - 89, characterized in that 
the rail treating elements (140, 158) bear on each other in the area

of overlap (U).
Device according to one of Claims 66 - 90, characterized in that
the rail treating elements (140, 158) bear on guide surfaces (136a,

156a) which are substantially at right-angles to the axial direction
(Ax) and which are offset in respect of each other in the axial

direction (Ax) of the guide rail (110).
Device according to Claim 91, characterized in that the guide
surfaces (136a, 156a) which are offset in respect of each other in

an axial direction and which are substantially at right-angles to the
axial direction are formed on a first (126) of two carrier parts

(126, 128) which bear flat on each other and in that the rail
treating elements (140, 158), corresponding to the offset of the

guide surfaces (136a, 156a), are of different thickness measured
in the axial direction and in that in the thicker (158) of the two rail

treating elements (140, 158) there is a marginal recess (164)
approximately corresponding to the thickness of the thinner (140)

of the two rail treating elements (140, 158) and in that the thinner
(140) of the two rail treating elements (140, 158) has a marginal

portion (166) which engages the marginal recess (164).
Device according to Claim 92, characterized in that the second
(128) of the two carrier parts (126, 128) which bear flat on each

other has a common flat surface bearing on the two rail treating
elements (140, 158).
Device according to one of Claims 66 - 93, characterized in that at
least one (140) of the rail treating elements (140, 158) has in a

plane at right-angles to the axial direction (Ax) a guidance
clearance which, not withstanding the guidance accuracy of guide 

means (136b) acting in the respective orthogonal plane, allows a
self-adaptation of the bearing edge (142) to an associated part of

a profile of the guide rail (110).
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 94, characterized by
separable holding means (170) provided on the guide carriage

(112) for the rail treating element (140, 158) which maintain the
rail treating element (140, 158) in an inoperative position prior to

application of the guide carriage (112) on the guide rail (110), i.e.
in a position in which the rail treating element (140, 158), on

positionally correct approximation of the guide carriage (112) to an
end of the guide rail (110) in the direction of the axis (Ax) of the

guide rail (110), remains disengaged from the guide rail (110).
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 41, characterized in that on
the treating element carrier (14) formed as a lubricating element

carrier an inner circumferential contour (22), i.e. an circumferential
contour (22) facing towards the guide rail, is arranged which - if

desired through a gasket - abuts on the guide rail (10) and acts as
a wiping device.
Device according to Claim 96, characterized in that the wiping
device is constructed such that it prevents the penetration of dirt

particles between the guide carrier (12) and the guide rail (10), at
the one hand, and restricts the lubricant dosage of the tracks

substantially to the respective axial length of the guide carriage
(12), on the other hand.
