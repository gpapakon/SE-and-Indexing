<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing phenolic resins having a very low level of 
metal ions, especially sodium and iron, and for using 
such phenolic resins in light-sensitive compositions. 
The present invention also relates to a process for 
making light-sensitive compositions useful in positive-working 
photoresist compositions. Further, the present 
invention relates to a process for coating substrates 
with these light-sensitive compositions as well as the 
process of coating, imaging and developing these light-sensitive 
mixtures on substrates. Photoresist compositions are used in 
microlithography processes for making miniaturized 
electronic components such as in the fabrication of 
computer chips and integrated circuits. Generally, in 
these processes, a thin coating of film of a photoresist 
composition is first applied to a substrate material, 
such as silicon wafers used for making integrated 
circuits. The coated substrate is then baked to 
evaporate any solvent in the photoresist composition and 
to fix the coating onto the substrate. The baked coated 
surface of the substrate is next subjected to an image-wise 
exposure to radiation. This radiation exposure causes a chemical 
transformation in the exposed areas of the coated 
surface. Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, electron 
beam and X-ray radiant energy are radiation types 
commonly used today in microlithographic processes. 
After this image-wise exposure, the coated substrate is 
treated with a developer solution to dissolve and remove 
either the radiation-exposed or the unexposed areas of 
the coated surface of the substrate.  
 Metal contamination has been a problem for a long 
time in the fabrication of high density integrated 
circuits and computer chips, often leading to increased 
defects, yield losses, degradation and decreased 
performance. In plasma processes, metals such as sodium 
and iron, when they are present in photoresists, can 
cause contamination especially during plasma stripping. 
However, these problems have been overcome to a 
substantial extent during the fabrication process. For 
example, by utilizing HCL gettering of the contaminants 
during a high temperature anneal cycle. As semiconductor devices have become more 
sophisticated, these problems have become much more 
difficult to overcome. When silicon wafers are coated 
with a liquid positive photoresist and subsequently 
stripped off, such as with oxygen microwave plasma, the 
performance and stability of the semiconductor
