<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stent for reduction of the diameter of a duct in the body of a living being, in particular of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, comprising a sleeve-like part having walls provided with perforations, widened ends and an intermediate section whose diameter is reduced by a constriction, and thrombogenic threads provided on the outside of the sleeve-like part between the widened ends.

Stent having a sleeve-like part (2), which has walls provided with
openings, widened ends and an intermediate area whose diameter is reduced

by a constriction, characterized in that the stent for reducing the diameter
of a canal in the body of a living being, such as in particular a

transjugular, intrahepatic, portosystemic shunt, has on the outside of the
sleeve-like part (2) between the widened ends thrombogenic threads (8).
Stent according to claim 1, characterized in that, at elevated temperature,
the sleeve-like part (2) is self-expanding.
Stent according to claim 2, characterized in that the sleeve-like part
(2) is made from a nickel-titanium alloy.
Stent according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the sleeve-like part has a lattice-like structure.
Stent according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the thrombogenic threads are arranged in a substantially axially parallel

manner.
Reducing stent according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the maximum end diameter is slightly larger than the diameter of

a shunt stent, into which the reducing stent is introduced for reducing the
free flow cross-section in the shunt stent.
Device for applying a canal in a living body, such as in particular a
transjugular, intrahepatic, portosystemic shunt with a shunt stent (7)

keeping the canal open, characterized by a reducing stent (1) reducing the
free flow cross-section in accordance with one of the preceding claims.
