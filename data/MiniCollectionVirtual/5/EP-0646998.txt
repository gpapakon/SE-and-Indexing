<ABSTRACT>
In order to allow connection of an electrical cable (12) in an end element (terminal) (10) having a partially frustoconical outer surface, a crimping tool is provided which comprises a gripping pincer (pair of tongs) (50) and a crimping die (60). When the element (10) to be crimped has been placed in a housing (48), actuation of the tool has the effect of gripping the element (10) by means of the pincer (50), closing the die (60) and then applying a tensile force on the end element, by means of the pincer (50), so as to make this element pass through the die. The die (60) then opens automatically and remains open until the tool returns to the rest position.

Crimping tool for the connection of an electric cable (12) in an end 
element (10) having an outer surface, whereof at least one section is 

initially frustum-shaped, characterized in that it comprises: 

a tool body (44) provided with a recess (48) having a given longitudinal 
axis and able to receive the end element, 
a gripping plier (50) located in a rear portion of the recess (48) and 
able to move along said longitudinal axis between a front loading position 

and a rear end of crimping position, 
means (48b, 56) for the automatic closure of the gripping plier outside 
its front loading position, 
a crimping die (60) located in the tool body around a recess (48) entrance 
portion and able to occupy a crimping position and an open position and 
crimping control means (42, 64, 70) for maintaining the crimping die (60) 
in the crimping position when the gripping plier (50) moves from its front 

loading position to its rear end of crimping position, and an open position 
when the gripping plier occupies one of its rear and front positions and 

when it moves from its rear position to its front position. 
Crimping tool according to claim 1, characterized in that the crimping 
die comprises crimping pistons (60) slidingly mounted in the tool body (44), 

according to radial axes radially distributed and intersecting said longitudinal 
axis at the same point. 
Crimping tool according to claim 2, characterized in that the crimping 
control means incorporate an annular member (64) surrounding the crimping 

pistons (60) and internally provided with cam surfaces (70), elastic means 
(72) maintaining each crimping piston (60) in engagement with said cam 

surfaces, and means (66) for linking in translation, parallel to said 
longitudinal axis, the gripping plier (50) and the annular member (64). 
Crimping tool according to claim 3, characterized in that the means for 
linking in translation the gripping plier (50) and the annular member (84) 

comprise a pin (66), which traverses a tubular portion (46) of the tool body 
and on which slides the annular member (64).  

 
Crimping tool according to either of the claims 3 and 4, characterized 
in that the cam surfaces (70) comprise: 


a rear cylindrical zone (70a) of relatively large diameter and in front 
of which are located the crimping pistons (60) in a front position of the 

annular member (64) corresponding to the front loading position of the 
gripping plier (50), 
a front cylindrical zone (70b) of relatively small diameter and in front of 
which are located the crimping pistons (60) between the front position of the 

annular member (64) and a rear position of said member corresponding to the 
rear end of crimping position of the gripping plier (50) and 
the same number of open helical grooves (70c) as there are crimping pistons, 
said grooves being regularly distributed on the periphery of the front 

cylindrical zone (70b) over the same depth as the rear cylindrical zone (70a). 
Crimping tool according to claims 4 and 5 combined, characterized in 
that the pin (66) traverses windows (68) formed in the tubular portion (46) 

of the tool body, said windows allowing a slight rotation of the annular 
member (64) with respect to the tool body and incorporating an inclined ledge 

able to come into contact with the pin (66) in order to automatically bring 
the annular member into its given angular position, when it occupies its 

front position, said given angular position being such that the crimping 
pistons (60) are then angularly aligned with the front ends of the grooves 

(70c) and angularly displaced relative to the rear ends of said grooves. 
Crimping tool according to any one of the claims 3 to 6, characterized in 
that the crimping control means (38) incorporate a manipulating member (42) 

able to exert a tensile force on the gripping plier, towards the rear of the 
recess, and means for returning the manipulating member to its inoperative 

position. 
Crimping tool according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the gripping plier comprises at least two jaws (52) urged towards an 

open position by second elastic means, the automatic closure means being 
constituted by a smaller diameter section (48b) of the rear portion of the 

recess (48).  
 
Crimping tool according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the gripping plier (50) comprises noses (54) able to bear against a 

shoulder (20) formed on the outer surface of the end element (10).
