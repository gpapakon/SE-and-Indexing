<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a connection between a rotating or swivelling valve and a rotating actuator with a connecting housing which is attached to the valve and the actuator and into which the outer end of the valve shaft projects, the outer end of the valve shaft being connected releasably to the output shaft of the actuator by a coupling part, a spring element (12) which pushes the coupling part (1,2) in the direction of the valve (9) being mounted on the coupling part (1,2).

Link between a rotary or swivel valve (9) 
having a valve shaft (6) and a rotary drive (11) having 

an output shaft (16) with a interconnecting housing 
(17), mounted on one side to the valve (9) and on the 

other side to the drive (11), into which the outer end 
of the valve shaft (6) projects, the said outer end 

being joined by a detachable coupling part (1,2) to the 
output shaft (16) of the drive (11), 
characterized in 
that
 a spring element (12) is seated on the coupling 
part (1,2) and pushes the coupling part (1,2) toward 

the valve (9), and that the coupling part (1,2) has a 
recess, more particularly a second recess (4) in the 

end (5) facing toward the valve (9), accommodating a 
positively locked nut (7) that is screwed onto the 

valve shaft (6). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the spring element (12) is coaxially seated on 
the end of the coupling part (1,2) facing away from the 

valve (9). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, , 

characterized in that
 the spring element (12) is a 
helical compression spring.  

 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the coupling part (1) 
is one-piece. 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 one end of the spring 
element rests on the coupling part (1,2) and the other 

end on the underside of the drive (11). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that,
 in the end facing the 
valve (9), the coupling part (1) has a first recess (3) 

in which the outer end of the valve shaft (6) is 
positively locked. 
Device according to Claim 6, 
characterized in 
that
 the valve shaft (6), particularly as a pivot with 
cheeks, has two mutually parallel side faces that lock 

positively into the groove-shaped recess (3) of the 
coupling part (1). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the nut (7) 
pressurizes a stuffing box packing, particularly by 

means of cup springs (15). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the second recess (4) 
is groove-shaped and with its two mutually parallel 

side faces contacts with two sides of the nut (7). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the longitudinal  
 

dimension of the first recess (3) lies at right angles 
to that of the second recess (4). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the first recess (3) 
extends deeper into the coupling part (1) than does the 

second recess (4). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the longitudinal 
dimension of the groove-shaped recess (3,4) lies 

perpendicular to the axis of the valve shaft (6).
