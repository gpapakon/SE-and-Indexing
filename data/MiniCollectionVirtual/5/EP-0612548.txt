<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for separating oil-in-water emulsions by primary breaking of the emulsion with an organic cationic emulsifier, separation of the resulting two-phase system into an oil phase and a water phase and secondary breaking of the oil phase with a demulsifier. By means of the invention, a process of the type mentioned at the outset is to be created by which good separation of the emulsion and economic and environmentally-friendly reuse of the oil is possible. This succeeds by the secondary breaking being carried out with an anionic, water-soluble, alkaline emulsier and separating the oil phase treated with this emulsifier into oil, water and solids in a three-phase decanter. Such a process is particularly suitable for treating oil-in-water emulsions arising as cooling fluids in the metal-processing industry.

Method for separating oil-in-water emulsions by primary 
cracking of the emulsions with an organic cationic 

demulsifier, separation of the resulting two-phase system 
into an oil phase and a water phase and secondary cracking 

of the oil phase with a demulsifier, characterised in that 
the secondary cracking is carried out with an anionic 

water-soluble alkaline demulsifier, and the oil phase 
treated with this demulsifier is separated in a three-phase 

decanter into oil, water and solids. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
oil phase obtained during primary cracking and separated is 

heated. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that 
before, after or during addition of the anionic water-soluble 

alkaline demulsifier, heating is carried out. 
Method according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
heating is carried out to temperatures from 60 to 90Â°C. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that an inorganic demulsifier is used as the anionic 

water-soluble alkaline demulsifier. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
inorganic demulsifier contains silicates and/or phosphates. 
Method according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that 
the inorganic demulsifier contains at least one base. 
Method according to any of claims 5 to 7, characterised 
in that the inorganic demulsifier contains salts which 

react alkaline in water.  
 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that before primary cracking, the oil layer floating on 

the oil-in-water emulsions is removed by skimming off. 
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that the 
oil layer removed by skimming off is supplied for secondary 

cracking together with the oil phase separated after 
primary cracking. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the oil-in-water emulsion before 

addition of the organic, cationic demulsifier is adjusted 
with an acid to a weakly acid pH value. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the water phase separated after 

primary cracking is treated subsequently. 
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the 
water phase is biologically treated subsequently. 
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the 
water phase is treated subsequently by ultrafiltration. 
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the 

water phase is treated subsequently by addition of an 
inorganic base.
