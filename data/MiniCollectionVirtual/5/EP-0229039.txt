<ABSTRACT>
A ski shoe binding device is disclosed. 
It comprises:
 

a toe covering portion (3) mounted on a binding table (B) 
fixed to a ski board (A) and permitting a toe portion (2) of a ski 

shoe (C) to be inserted therein,
 

an engaging portion (10) always energized toward the 
bottom of the ski shoe (C) and projecting from the upper sur­

face of the ski board (A) within the toe covering portion (3),
 

a manipulating portion (11) projecting from an upper sur­
face of the ski board (A) on the outside of the toe covering 

portion (3) and adapted to push down the engaging portion 
(10) resisting the energizing force,

 
a projection (12) projecting fromthe upper surface of the 

ski board,
 

an engaging recess formed inthe bottom of the ski shoe 
(C) for engaging the engaging portion (10) with the ski shoe

 
and a groove formed in the bottom of theski shoe (C) for 

engaging the projection (12) with the ski shoe (C). 
This device provides easy detachment of the ski shoes 
from the ski boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ski shoe binding device 
for attaching ski shoes to ski boards. In a conventional ski shoe binding device, after putting 
ski shoes on ski boards at predetermined positions, the ski 
shoes are attached to the ski boards by adequately manipulating 
the binding device. Accordingly, when attaching, a skier is required to lean 
forward to manipulate the binding device for attachment. Likewise, when detaching the ski shoes from the ski 
boards, the skier is required to lean forward to detach the 
shoes. Although the attaching and detaching manipulation is 
being simplified, there are still many which require troublesome 
manipulation. It is therefore a general object of the present 
invention to provide a ski shoe binding device in which 
disadvantages involved in the conventional ski shoe binding 
devices are eliminated. It is a specific object of the present invention to 
provide a ski shoe binding device in which ski shoes can be 
attached to ski boards simply by inserting the toe portions 
of the ski shoes into toe covering portions and without 
troublesome manipulation of the binding device.  
 It is another specific object of the present 
invention to provide a ski shoe binding device in which 
ski shoes can be easily detached from ski boards simply 
by pushing down a manipulating portion. It is a further object of the present invention 
to provide a ski shoe binding device in which ski shoes 
will neither be detached from ski boards nor be 
displaced sidewardly while skiing. The present invention is then relative to a 
ski shoe binding structure more particularly comprising 
a ski board, a toe covering member having an upper toe 
covering portion for receiving a toe of a shoe 
thereunder and having a lower surface with an aperture 
disposed therein and below said toe covering portion, an 
engaging piece having a detent projecting upwardly said detent being 
aligned with said aperture, a 
biaising means for urging said engaging piece upwardly; 
an elongate projection extending upwardly from the upper 
surface of said ski board rearwardly of said recess in 
said ski board; and a ski shoe having a bottom thereof; 
engaging means for engaging said elongate projection 
with said ski shoe. Such a structure is yet known by 
FR-A-2 519 557. In order to achieve the above objects the 
invention has the specific structure comprising the 
means of claim 1, complementaries to those cited above. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent during the

<CLAIMS>
1. A ski shoe binding structure comprising: 

_ a ski board (A) having a recess (1) 
formed in an upper surface thereof, 
_ a toe covering member having an upper toe 
covering portion (3) for receiving a toe (2) of a shoe 

thereunder and also having a lower surface (6) with an aperture 
(6a) disposed therein and below said toe covering 

portion, and being fixedly attached (4) to said upper 
surface of the ski board (A), 
_ an engaging piece (10) provided in said 
recess, extending therein, having a detent (10) 

projecting upwardly therefrom, being pivotally connected 
to said ski board for rotation about an axis (8), and 

having a manipulating portion (11) projecting upwardly a 
head of said toe covering member (3-5-6), said detent 

being positioned beneath said toe covering member (3), 
aligned with said aperture (6a) and projecting through 

said aperture upon upward pivotal movement of said 
engaging piece, 
_ a biaising means (9) for urging said 
engaging piece (10) to rotate about said axis (8), 
_ an elongate projection (12) extending 
upwardly from the upper surface of said ski board (A) 

rearwardly of said recess (1) in said ski board, 
_ a ski shoe having a bottom thereof; and 
_ engaging means for engaging said elongate 
projection (12) with said ski shoe, 
_ said ski shoe having a recess (13) 
formed in said shoe bottom and complementary to said 

detent (10), such that said ski shoe (C) and said 
engaging piece (10) cooperate so that, when said ski 

shoe is stepped onto said ski board to bring said shoe 
(C) into engagement with said elongate projection (12) 

by way of said engaging means (14) and slid forwardly 
into said toe covering member (3-5-6) to press  

 
down said engaging piece (10) until said recess (13) of 

said ski shoe passes said detent (10), said detent is 
locked into said recess in a snap action. 
2. A ski shoe binding structure as claimed in 
claim 1, wherein said engaging means includes a groove 

(14) formed in said bottom of said ski shoe. 
3. A ski shoe binding structure as claimed in 
claim 1, wherein said toe covering member (3-5-6) 

comprises a forwardly extending portion (5) including an 
aperture (5a) through which said manipulating portion 

(11) projects upwardly. 
4. A ski shoe binding structure as claimed in 
claim 3, wherein said forwardly extending portion (5) is 

integrally formed with said toe covering member (3-5-6). 
5. A ski shoe binding structure as claimed in 
claim 1, wherein said detent projects upwardly from a 

position intermediate said front and said rear of said 
engaging piece (10). 
6. A ski shoe binding structure as claimed in 
claim 5, wherein a forwardly extending portion (5), 

connected to said toe covering member (3-5-6), includes 
an aperture (5a) through which said manipulating portion 

(11) projects upon pivotal movement of said engaging 
piece (10).
