<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photosensitive recording 
materials suitable for use in electrophotography. In electrophotography photoconductive materials are used to form 
a latent electrostatic charge image that is developable with finely 
divided colouring material, called toner. The developed image can then be permanently affixed to the 
photoconductive recording material, e.g. a photoconductive zinc 
oxide-binder layer, or transferred from the photoconductor layer, 
e.g. a selenium or selenium alloy layer, onto a receptor material, 
e.g. plain paper and fixed thereon. In electrophotographic copying 
and printing systems with toner transfer to a receptor material the 
photoconductive recording material is reusable. In order to permit 
rapid multiple printing or copying, a photoconductor layer has to be 
used that rapidly loses its charge on photo-exposure and also 
rapidly regains its insulating state after the exposure to receive 
again a sufficiently high electrostatic charge for a next image 
formation. The failure of a material to return completely to its 
relatively insulating state prior to succeeding charging/imaging 
steps is commonly known in the art as "fatigue". The fatigue phenomenon has been used as a guide in the selection 
of commercially useful photoconductive materials, since the fatigue 
of the photoconductive layer limits the copying rates achievable. A further important property which determines the suitability of 
a particular photoconductive material for electrophotographic 
copying is its photosensitivity, which must be sufficiently high for 
use in copying apparatuses operating with the fairly low intensity 
light reflected from the original. Commercial usefulness also 
requires that the photoconductive layer has a spectral sensitivity 
that matches the spectral intensity distribution of the light source 
e.g. a laser or a lamp. This enables, in the case of a white light 
source, all the colours to be reproduced in balance. Known photoconductive recording materials exist in different 
configurations with one or more "active" layers coated on a  
 
conducting substrate and include optionally an outermost protective 
layer. By "active" layer is meant a layer that plays a role in the 
formation of the electrostatic charge image. Such a layer may be 
the layer responsible for charge carrier generation, charge carrier 
transport or both. Such layers may have a homogeneous structure or 
heterogeneous structure. Examples of active layers in said photoconductive recording
