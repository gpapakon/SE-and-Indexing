<ABSTRACT>
A method of recovering an aluminum alloy and a 
stainless steel alloy from an air bag inflator 10 that has 

aluminum alloy parts, including an aluminum alloy housing 
12 and non-aluminum alloy parts, including a non-aluminum 

gas filter 18. The non-aluminum parts have a higher 
melting temperature than the aluminum alloy parts of the 

air bag inflator 10. The method comprises heating the air 
bag inflator 10 in the range of the melting temperature of 

aluminum and then recovering the aluminum alloy which is 
not contaminated with the material of the higher melti
ng 
temperature parts. After the aluminum alloy has melted 

from the air bag inflator 10, the non-aluminum parts are 
heated to a higher temperature to melt any stainless steel 

alloy from the non-aluminum parts. The stainless steel 
alloy is recovered as a high purity stainless steel alloy 

end product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
reclaiming an aluminum alloy and a stainless steel alloy
from an air bag inflator.Air bags are inflated to restrain a vehicle occupant
during a vehicle collision. The air bags are inflated by
gas. The gas is typically provided by ignition of a gas
generating material contained in an air bag inflator. The
air bag inflator often has aluminum parts, typically the
inflator housing, and stainless steel parts, typically
filter screens for filtering the gas as it flows into the
air bag.Attempts have been made to reclaim aluminum alloys
used in parts of the air bag inflator. Manual or
mechanical stripping has been employed to separate the
aluminum alloy parts from the other parts of the air bag 
inflator. Mechanical stripping is relatively expensive and
labor intensive.Cupola smelting has been used to reclaim metals from
an air bag inflator. The complete air bag inflator is
heated in a cupola furnace to melt the metal parts. The
resulting metal end product is an aluminum alloy metal
contaminated with other metals including stainless steel.
The contaminated metal end product has little industrial
application and nominal economic value.Further, attention is drawn to US-A-4 457 494, which shows a
metal melting furnace, which is suited for separation of nonferrous
metals with attached ferrous components. For said
separation process a variety of metallic waste materials is
inserted into a melt chamber and then the temperature of the
melt chamber is raised to the melting point of the metallic
waste material having the lowest melting point. The metallic
waste material having the lowest melting point melts, and is
drained to a holding chamber, after which the remaining
material is removed from the melt chamber. The method of the instant invention is advantageous in
that a substantially pure aluminum alloy and a
substantially pure stainless steel alloy can be reclaimed
as useful metal end products from an air bag inflator and in that non-aluminum parts form a case enclosing residues of gas generating material.The present invention is a method of recovering an
aluminum alloy from an air bag inflator that has aluminum
alloy parts as set forth in claim 1. Further, the present invention involves a process for
recovering aluminum alloy and stainless steel alloy from an air bag inflator
as set forth in claim 12. The inflator comprises aluminum alloy parts, including an aluminum alloy
housing, and stainless steel parts including
parts of a gas filter in the housing. First, the

method comprising the steps of:


placing the air bag inflator (10) in a furnace (108);
