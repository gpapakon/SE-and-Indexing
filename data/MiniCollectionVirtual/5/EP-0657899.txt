<ABSTRACT>
With the intention of establishing fabrication methods for 
cheaply produced (Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R-type bonded magnets or 

(Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R-M-type bonded magnets containing few rare earth 
elements and having a coercive force iHc above 5 kOe and a 

residual magnetic flux density Br above 5.5 kG matching the cost 
performance of hard ferrite magnets, we have obtained an 

iron-based permanent magnet material consisting of microcrystal 
clusters where the average crystal size of each component phase is 

in the range 1 nm ∼ 30 nm and where both a soft magnetic phase 
consisting of a ferromagnetic alloy whose main components are 

α-Fe and a ferromagnetic alloy having iron, and a hard magnetic 
phase having a Nd₂Fe₁₄B-type crystal structure coexist within 

the same powder particles. This aggregate material is obtained by 
melt-quenching a (Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R (R = one or both of Pr, Nd)-type 

molten alloy or a (Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R-M (M = Al, Si, S, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, 
Ag, Pt, Au, Pb)-type molten alloy of a particular composition 

containing few rare earth elements, to obtain an essentially 
amorphous structure or a structure both amorphous and with small 

amounts of fine crystals, and by applying a crystallisation heat 
treatment under specific conditions. By grinding this aggregate to 

an average powder particle size of 3 micrometres ∼ 500 
micrometres and combining the resultant iron-based permanent 

magnet alloy powder with a resin, we can obtain an iron-based 
bonded magnet with good thermal and magnetic properties and 

with the magnetic characteristics

<DESCRIPTION>
With the intention of establishing fabrication methods for
cheaply produced (Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R-type resin bonded permanent
magnets or (Fe,Co)-Cr- B-R-M-type bonded magnets containing
few rare earth elements and having a coercive force iHc above
3.98 · 105 A/m (5 kOe and a residual magnetic flux density Br
above 0.55 T (5.5 kG)
matching the cost performance of hard ferrite magnets, this
invention, broadly stated, provides iron-based permanent
magnet material consisting of microcrystal clusters where the
average crystal size of each component phase is in the range 1
nm to 30 nm and where both a soft magnetic phase consisting
of a ferromagnetic alloy whose main components are α-Fe
and a ferromagnetic alloy having iron, and a hard magnetic
phase having a Nd2Fe14B-type crystal structure, coexist
within the same powder particles.This is achieved by melt-quenching of a (Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R
(where R = Pr, Nd)-type molten alloy or a (Fe,Co)-Cr-B-R-M
(where M = Al, Si, S, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ag, Pt, Au, Pb)-type
molten alloy of a particular composition containing few rare
earth elements, to obtain an essentially amorphous structure or
a structure both amorphous and with small amounts of fine
crystals, and by applying a crystallisation heat treatment under
specific conditions.By grinding this iron-based permanent magnet to an
average powder particle size of 3 micrometres to 500
micrometres and combining the resultant iron-based permanent
magnet alloy powder with a resin, we can obtain an iron-based
bonded magnet with good thermal and magnetic properties and
with the magnetic characteristics:-
intrinsic coersive force, iHc ≥ 3.98 · 105 A/m (5 kOe),residual magnetic flux density, Br ≥ 0.55 T (5.5 kG), and witha magnetic energy, (BH)max ≥ 47.7 kJ/m3 (6MGOe).This invention, relating to iron-based permanent magnets
and alloy powders for iron-based bonded magnets and their
fabrication, used for obtaining suitable iron-based bonded
magnets for all kinds of motors, actuators and magnetic
circuits for magnetic sensors, as well as magnetic rolls and
speakers, regards iron-based permanent magnets and their
fabrication which yield isotropic iron-based bonded magnets
having a residual magnetic flux density Br greater than 0.5 T
(5 kG) unobtainable from hard ferrite magnets.Permanent magnets used in stepping motors, power
motors and actuators utilised in home electronic goods and
electric goods in general are mainly limited to hard ferrites,
which have various problems such as, demagnetisation at low
temperatures with the fall of iHc, the
