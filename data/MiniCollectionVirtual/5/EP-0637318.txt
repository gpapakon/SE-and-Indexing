<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel peptide derivatives which have activity as enzyme
inhibitors, in particular as inhibitors of thrombin. The invention relates also to methods for
the production of such enzyme inhibitors, to pharmaceutical compositions containing the
latter and to their use as anticoagulant agents.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of the formula I

   in which R1 and R2 are each C1-C4
alkyl, R3, R4 and R5 are each hydrogen; Arg is arginine; X is methine CH or nitrogen; n is
an integer from 0 to 7; L is a peptide linker comprising 3 to 6 amino acids selected from
the group consisting of a C2-C12-ω-amino carboxylic acid, alanine, serine, threonine,
glutamine, asparagine, phenylglycine or phenylalanine; and H is the carboxy terminal end
of hirudin starting with amino acid 55 and ending at the ultimate or penultimate amino
acid of hirudin, a desulphated variant of such a hirudin comprising a tyrosine sulphate
residue, a variant of such a hirudin in which the tyrosine sulphate residue is replaced by a
tyrosine phosphate residue, or a derivative thereof in which 1-3 amino acids are replaced
by other amino acids,which derivatives retain the binding affinity to thrombin; wherein the
backbone chain (II) defined by the formula

comprises about 18 to about 28, in particular about 22 to about 26, atoms; and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Within the scope of the present description, the definitions used hereinbefore and
hereinafter have preferably the following meanings:C1-C4 Alkyl is, for example, corresponding unbranched alkyl such as ethyl, n-propyl or,
especially, methyl. C3-C7 Cycloalkyl is, for example, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. Halogen
is, for example, fluoro, chloro or bromo. C7-C10 Aralkyl is, for example, phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl
such as 2-phenylethyl or, in particular, benzyl. 5 or 6 membered azacycloalkyl is, for 
example, pyrrolidyl or piperidyl while 5 or 6 membered oxazacycloalkyl is especially
morpholyl.The peptide linker L comprises 3 to 7 amino acids which may be naturally occurring, more
especially genetically encoded, amino acids or synthetic amino acids. Because the role of
this portion of the molecule is to provide a bridge between the "N-terminal" aryl moiety
and the C-terminal hirudin sequence the length rather than the structure of the linker is of
importance. Therefore, the choice of the amino acids to be included into the linker is not
crucial. However, in order to avoid any undesired counteraction between the side chain of
linker amino acids and
