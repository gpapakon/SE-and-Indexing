<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a level detector for a granular material, in particular sand, inside a container, comprising a feeler (finger) (50A) arranged inside the container (R) and mounted so that it can move, the assembly being such that, when the level of the material (1) is greater than or equal to a safety limit (N), the feeler (50A) at rest is in the vicinity of the granular material (1) or inside this material (1); means for exerting a force on the feeler (50A) so that, when the level of the granular material (1) is less than the safety limit (N), displacement of the feeler (50A) is ensured under the action of this force; and warning means (100) which are controlled by the displacement of the feeler (50A) and can indicate to an operator that the level of the granular material (1) is less than the safety limit (N); characterised in that the feeler (50A) is mounted so that it can move along a substantially horizontal direction, and the abovementioned means for exerting a force are capable of exerting on the feeler (50A) a force which is also horizontal.
