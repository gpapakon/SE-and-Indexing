<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for the cold rolling of rolling stock in strip form comprising a reversing stand (2) arranged between two coiling/uncoiling reels (8,9). Using single-stand reversing mills of this kind it is possible to roll about 450,000 t of hot-rolled strip into cold strip per year. In order to be able to roll about 700,000 t of cold strip per year, the invention proposes that a second reversing stand (3) should be provided in the rolling line of the reversing stand and that to carry out the rolling operation both stands should be adjustable for successive passes.

Plant for cold-rolling strip-shaped roll stock, comprising two reversing stands (2, 3),
which are arranged between two reversing reel devices (8, 9) without interposition of

further devices, and a reel device (10), from which the charge strip can be unreeled,
wherein for the performance of the rolling process the two reversing stands (2, 3) are

simultaneously adjusted in correspondence with successive passes and wherein the
reversing stands (2, 3) are equipped with working roll quick-change devices (14, 15, 16),

by way of which the working rolls, which are provided with working roll chocks in modular
mode of construction can be changed in pushing-through operation, and wherein a change

for working rolls (4, 4'; 5, 5') of different diameter and/or different surface roughness is
possible.
Plant according to claim 1, characterised in that the reversing stands (2, 3) are
four-high stands, the backing rolls (6, 6'; 7, 7') of which are driven and the working rolls (4,

4'; 5, 5') or backing rolls of which are for the purpose of horizontal stabilisation
displaceable in horizontal direction out of the vertical plane formed by a working roll set (4,

4' or 5, 5') or backing roll set (6, 6' or 7, 7').
Plant according to claim 1, characterised in that the reversing stands (2, 3) are six-high
stands, the intermediate rolls of which are driven and the working rolls or intermediate

rolls of which are for the purpose of horizontal stabilisation displaceable in horizontal
direction out of the vertical plane formed by a working roll set or intermediate roll set.
Plant according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the working rolls (4, 4'; 5, 5')
and/or the backing rolls (6, 6'; 7, 7') are equipped with drives for the axial displacement

and that the displaceable rolls preferably have 'CVC' [continuously variable crown] surface

grinding.
Plant according to claim 1 or 3, characterised in that the working rolls and/or the
intermediate rolls are equipped with drives for the axial displacement and that the

displaceable rolls preferably have 'CVC' [continuously variable crown] surface grinding.
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a thrust pickling
device (17) is arranged upstream of the reel device (10, 10'). 
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the reel device (10,
10') is a reversing reel device (10').
Method of reversible cold-rolling strip-shaped roll stock in a plant comprising two
reversing stands (2, 3) and a reel device (10), from which the charge strip can be

unreeled, wherein for the performance of the rolling process the two reversing stands (2,
3) are simultaneously adjusted in correspondence with successive passes and the charge

strip is unreeled from the reel device (10) and is rolled in the reversing stands (2, 3), which
are associated with one another without interposition of further devices, each time in one

pass, wherein a high strip tension level corresponding to the reducing behaviour of a fourstand

or six-stand tandem rolling train is set between the reversing stands (2, 3) and the
strip leaving the reversing stand (3) is reeled up on the associated reversing reel device

(9), wherein after unreeling of the charge strip from the reel device (10) the reversing
stands (2, 3) and this reversing reel device (9) are reversed and subsequently the strip is

unreeled from this reversing reel device (9), rolled in the reversing stands (3, 2) and reeled
up on the other reversing reel device (8), wherein the high strip tension level is set

between the reversing stands (3, 2) and wherein after unreeling the strip from the first
reversing reel device (9) the reversing stands (3, 2) and the two reversing reel devices (9,

8) are reversed.
