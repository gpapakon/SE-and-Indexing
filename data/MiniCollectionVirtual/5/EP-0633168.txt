<ABSTRACT>
Air bag impact protection device for motor vehicles, composed of an air cushion and a generator fastening casing, which is connected to the air bag, for accommodating a gas generator, in the casing of which there is integrally moulded to the lower end of the air bag (1) a pocket (4) which encloses the generator (3) on all sides and/or the air bag (1) has at its lower end the shape of a pocket (4) which encloses the generator (3) on all sides. The pocket is provided at its lower end with an aperture which can take the form of tongues (5, 6) which are sewn to the lateral edges and overlap one another in a labyrinthine fashion for generators having an ignitor arranged on the end face and can take the form of a window for generators having an ignitor arranged on the outside surface. The generator fastening casing (2) takes the form of an enclosed cage which has at least one opening (10) on its surface pointing towards the air cushion, the pocket (4) and the generator fastening casings being provided on the same lateral side with respectively one overlapping aperture (7, 8), via which the generator (3) can be inserted into the generator fastening casing (2). The aperture in the side part of the pocket (4) has a smaller diameter than the aperture (7) in the generator fastening casing (2).

Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles, comprising a gas cushion, a generator mounting 

housing, configured as a cage, for the accommodation of a 
gas generator which has at least one opening on its face 

remote from the gas cushion, and a support, which is 
connected to the lower end of the gas cushion and surrounds 

the generator mounting housing, characterised in that the 
support is formed from a pocket assembly (4), which is 

attached in one piece to the gas cushion and surrounds the 
generator (3) on all sides, said pocket assembly having at 

its lower end an opening in the form of flaps (5, 6), which 
cover one another in a labyrinth-like manner and are 

stitched at the lateral edges. 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to claim 1, characterised in that the 

generator mounting housing (2) is configured as a closed 
cage which has at least one opening (10) on its face remote 

from the gas cushion, the pocket assembly (4) and the 
generator mounting housing each being provided laterally at 

one end with a respective covering opening (7, 8), via 
which the generator (3) can be introduced into the 

generator mounting housing (2). 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to claim 2, characterised in that the 

opening (8) in the lateral portion of the pocket assembly 
has a smaller diameter than the opening (7) of the 

generator mounting housing (2). 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to claim 2, characterised in that the 

generator mounting housing (2) has the form of a closed 
sleeve with a plurality of bores on its face remote from 

the gas cushion.  
 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 

in that the opening (7) has a greater diameter than the 
generator cartridge, but has a smaller width than the 

generator flange (11). 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 

in that the generator mounting housing (2) has at least one 
opening (10) on its face remote from the gas cushion. 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to claim 1, characterised in that the 

opening on the base of the pocket assembly (4) has the form 
of a window (16). 
Shock-absorbing airbag safety system for automotive 
vehicles according to claim 7, characterised in that the 

edges (20) of the window (16) are reinforced by the 
provision of a border and by stitching the edge of the 

border.
