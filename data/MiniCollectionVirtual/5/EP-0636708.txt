<ABSTRACT>
Method to prevent the exhaustion of acid copper plating 
baths (12) and to treat sewage or sludges (20) containing 

copper in an ionic form so as to recover metallic copper 
(39), the method including the addition (11) of a compound 

which keeps the concentration of iron below a critical value 
(for instance, 60 grs/lt.), the compound causing 

precipitation of iron in the form of ferrous sulphate and 
thus preventing the co-deposition of crystals of ferrous 

sulphate and copper sulphate with a possible incorporation 
of organic impurities such as stearates (35) present in the 

acid cooper plating baths (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method to prevent the exhaustion 
of acid copper plating baths and to recover metallic copper 
from solutions and sludges containing copper in an ionic 
form, as set forth in the main claim. The method according to the invention is applied to the 
treatment of acid copper plating baths employed in plants 
which plate with copper, for instance, welding rods or other 
iron or steel materials that have to be plated with copper, 
and is also applied to the treatment of fluids containing 
copper in an ionic form, such as the sewage from plants 
carrying out electrolytic or chemical engraving of copper, 
plants which wash copper plated objects, etc. The method according to the invention is applied to 
individual copper plating baths and to centralised copper 
plating baths in which the same acid copper plating solution 
held in a reservoir is circulated through a plurality of 
copper plating tanks. One of the methods of the state of the art for the copper 
plating of metallic objects made of steel, for instance, 
consists in the immersion of those objects, for instance in 
the form of rods, in a tank containing an acid copper 
plating bath consisting of an aqueous solution of sulphuric 
acid (H2SO4) and copper sulphate (CuSO4 ). As the object passes through the acid bath, copper ions 
are reduced and are deposited on the object and cover it, 
while iron ions pass into solution and form ferrous 
sulphate. It has been found that, when the quantity of iron in the 
acid copper plating bath is greater than 60 g/l, copper  
 
plating defects appear which make the end product 
unsatisfactory, and therefore it is necessary to replace the 
spent acid copper plating bath with a new bath. It has been found in particular that the copper plating 
defects consist in the formation of united crystals of 
ferrous sulphate and copper sulphate to form very hard 
crystals on the surface of the object thus plated with 
copper. Where welding rods are being copper plated, the crystals 
incorporate also the stearates present as impurities in the 
bath. Where rods are concerned, the surface crystals create 
sliding problems and tend to detach fragments of copper from 
the surface of the metallic rod. The exhaustion of the acid copper plating bath entails 
very serious consequences for the plant inasmuch as these 
spent acid copper plating baths form toxic and damaging 
wastes and, as such, have to be disposed of or treated on 
the spot. The costs of disposal of these acid baths are very high 
and therefore
