the storage compartment and one of several playback units (7) 

provided on the vertical axis of the record magazines (3), 
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT: 


a raising and lowering device (9) is movable by means of a 
motor driven eccentric-control (19) and is arranged above 

each playback unit (7); 
the raising and lowering device (9) comprises a carrying 
arm (20) for receiving the record holder (4) with its 

record (1) and provided with a disc record hold-down device 
(21), and 
the carrying arm (20) is borne slidingly on a vertically

A disc record player according to Claim 1 CHARACTERIZED IN 
THAT a drive motor (24) is attached to the support (22) and is 

coupled through a worm device (25) with the eccentric (28), the 
eccentric (28) sits on the shaft (26) of the worm wheel (27), and 

the eccentric (28) rests on a fixed roller (29) in such a way that 
the eccentric (28) determines the upper and lower end positions of 

the lifting and lowering device (9). 
A disc record player according to Claim 1 or 2 
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT, for the recognition of the upper and lower 

end positions of the lifting and lowering device (9), two

above the other and cooperate with a suitably stationary peg (31). 
A disc record according to any one of Claims 1 to 3

stored on the record holder (4) relative to the turntable (8) of 

the player unit (7). 
A disc record according to any of Claims 1 to 4

end position when carrying a record holder (4) with a record (1), 

and on withdrawal of the record (1) from its holder (4), places 
the record (1) onto the turntable of the player unit (7), and, by
