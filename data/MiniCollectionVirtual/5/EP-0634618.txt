<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a self-refrigerating process for cryogenic fractionation and purification of gas, and a heat exchanger for carrying out this process. The gaseous fluid is treated in an exchanger forming a unitary assembly: it is partially condensed by cooling in the circuits (C5) and (C1) and the uncondensed gaseous fraction is reheated in the circuit (C2). The required cold is supplied by the condensates which, after supercooling (C3) and pressure reduction (V1) evaporate (C4). The process can be carried out in an exchanger comprising multiple channels for each circuit. This process allows the purification of a gaseous fluid having a plurality of components which can be condensed by cooling.

Self-refrigerating method of cryogenic fractionation and 
purification of a gaseous feed fluid with at least two 

condensable components with differing condensation 
temperatures, at least one relatively heavy component to be 

removed and at least one relatively light component to be
