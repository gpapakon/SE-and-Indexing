<ABSTRACT>
Upon performing printing using a dye ink and a
pigment ink and in addition a treatment liquid

making those inks insoluble, two kinds of inks
consisted of the pigment ink (I
p
) and the dye ink
(I
d
) are used. After applying the pigment ink (I
p
)
on a printing medium (P), the dye ink (I
d
) is
applied overlaying with the pigment ink. After

mixing these inks on the printing medium (P), the
treatment liquid (S) which makes the inks insoluble,

is applied. In the alternative, a mixed ink (I
m
) in
which a pigment ink not requiring a dispersant and

the dye, is used. After application of this mixed
ink (I
m
) on the printing medium (P), the treatment
liquid (S) which makes the ink (I
m
) insoluble, is
applied. Therefore, problem of "crack", "soaking

out", "overflow" or lowering of OD value which can
be caused upon reaction of the pigment ink (I
p
) and
the dye ink (I
d
) or the mixed ink (I
m
) with the
treatment liquid (S), can be solved to achieve high

quality printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
ink-jet printing apparatus and a printing method.
More particularly, the invention relates to an ink-jet
printing apparatus and a printing method
performing printing of characters, images and the
like on a printing medium, such as a printing paper,
an OHP film and the like using an ink and a liquid
which makes a coloring material in the ink insoluble
or breaks its dispersion (hereinafter also referred to as a treatment
liquid).A treatment liquid of this kind reacts with a
coloring material contained in an ink, such as a
pigment, dye and the like and makes the coloring
material insoluble or breaks its dispersion. In the ink-jet printing
technology, in general, the treatment liquid is
ejected overlaying on the portion where the ink is
ejected on the printing medium or in the vicinity
thereof, for admixing the ink and the treatment
liquid to cause reaction. Then, as a result of
reaction, the coloring material of the ink is fixed
on the surface of the printing medium or with
penetrating into the printing medium for achieving
water resistance of the printing product.It has also been known that action for making
the coloring material in the ink insoluble also 
serves for limiting penetration of the pigment or
dye in a surface layer of the printing medium, to
result in improvement of an optical density of the
printing medium (hereinafter occasionally simply
referred to as "OD value").However, in the conventional ink-jet printing
technology using the foregoing treatment liquid, it
has been newly recognized by the inventors that
there have been respective problems per coloring
materials to be employed in the ink for improving
printing quality.When a dye is used as the coloring material, a
first problem is encountered in that sufficiently
high OD value cannot be obtained even when the dye
and the treatment liquid are reacted. This is
because that the dye per se cannot develop
relatively high OD value as used for printing.
Therefore, even if the treatment liquid and the dye
are reacted to fix the most part of the dye in the
surface layer of the printing medium as above-mentioned,
the OD value is not so high as compared
with the case where pigment is used as the coloring
material.The second problem to be encountered in the dye
that the inventor has found, is a phenomenon so-called
"overflow" or "sweep", and particularly that
an edge portion of a printed image becomes blur.Figs. 1A to 1D are illustrations for explaining
the phenomenon in the predictive manner. As shown
in
