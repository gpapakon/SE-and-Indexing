<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for variably converting a DC voltage to a different 
DC voltage level comprises a multi-resonant electronic power 

converter (50) with a wide output voltage dynamic range. The power 
conversion is accomplished by converting (in 20) the DC voltage (1) 

to an AC signal, adjusting or attenuating (in 30) the AC signal to 
the desired amplitude, and then converting (in 40) the AC signal 

back to a DC voltage. The output voltage may be adjusted (by 10) by 
altering the frequency of the AC signal also known as the switching 

frequency. A wide dynamic range is achieved at a narrow switching 
frequency bandwidth by inserting either a fourth or higher order low 

pass filter (30) or a notch filter at the output of the switching 
transistor (in 20). The high roll-off rate exhibited by either 

filter provides a relatively high dynamic range in a narrow 
frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable high frequency 
multi-resonant electronic DC-DC power converters 
and to methods of providing a variable power supply 
to a load. In communication satellites serving multiple users 
and in other applications having similar power 
constraints, it is desirable to have the capability to 
transmit signals at different strengths matched to the 
user's needs. The signal strength requirements of a 
particular satellite's users can vary greatly. For 
example, a low baud rate digital signal to be transmitted 
for one user may require much less transmission power 
than an analog television signal for another, due to 
different signal to noise ratio requirements for the two 
signals. Therefore, in order to utilize the satellite's 
limited power resources in an efficient and cost 
effective manner, it is beneficial to provide a power 
level appropriate for each user. It is known that by 
controllably varying the DC bias voltage levels to the 
satellite's rf amplifier stages, the transmission power 
of the satellite may be adjusted to meet a particular 
user's needs. A multi-resonant DC-DC electronic power converter 
(MRC) is currently being employed to provide variable 
bias voltage levels. This MRC converts the satellite's 
high voltage DC bus into a DC output level. The output 
level is controlled by a switching frequency signal which 
is supplied to the MRC by a control circuit. The control  
 
circuit determines the switching frequency based upon the 
transmission power requirements. The switching frequency signal drives a switching 
transistor in the MRC, which converts the satellite's 
high voltage DC bus into an AC voltage. The AC voltage 
is then processed by a simple LC low pass filter and 
thereafter converted back into DC. By choosing a 
switching frequency that falls on the gain slope region 
of the low pass filter, any adjustment in frequency will 
vary the dc output level. This prior art MRC, however, 
suffers from having a limited dynamic range of output 
levels. The benefits of MRCs are not limited to satellite 
applications but are also desirable in many system 
applications where similar design constraints came into 
play. For example, portable and cellular telephones 
require various levels of power, depending on the 
distance between the transmitter and the receiver. An 
MRC would have similar advantages in those systems, as 
well as others.  
 According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a converter 
as claimed in claim 1. According to another
