<ABSTRACT>
An implement for milking animals comprises a 
milking parlour, a robot arm (7) able to carry teat cups 

(80), detection means (75) with the aid of which the position 
of a teat relative to the robot arm (7) is determined, and 

control means (14, 41, 49, 58, 64) for conveying the robot 
arm (7) from a position outside the milking parlour in such a 

position under the animal's udder that a teat cup (80) can be 
connected to an animal's teat. For each teat cup (80) a 

flexible connecting member (81) connected to said teat cup 
and an operating cylinder (81) are provided. After milking, 

this cylinder (81) pulls automatically said teat cup (80) 
from a respective teat by means of the flexible connecting 

member, whereby this cylinder (81) is automatically released 
when the teat cup (80) is moved towards the teat in order to 

be connected thereto by means of said robot arm (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement for
milking animals according to the preamble of claim 1.Such an implement is known from
EP-A-0 213 660 which describes a milking
machine in which the teat cups are attached to a removal
device via traction cables. During milking the animal is
therefore free to move. When milking has finished, the teat
cups are moved onto a stop which is located on the removal
device. This construction has the disadvantage that an extra
device is needed for the teat cups to be stationed after
milking has finished. For a next milking cycle the robot arm
must collect the teat cups from the extra device which is
time consuming and inefficient.US-A-3,726,252 describes a milking machine in which
the teat cups are operable via cables operated by pistons.
This device has the disadvantage that the teat cups are
manually attached to the udder. In order to mitigate these
problems, according to the invention, the implement is
adapted to produce a vacuum inside the teat cup when the teat
cup is moved upwardly, so that the teat cup sucks to the
teat, thereafter the operating cylinder is operated in such a
way that the teat cup can move freely relative to the robot
arm and remains connected to the teat of the udder. Thereby a
robot arm end portion may be provided with means to catch a
teat cup when the milking has ended. The robot arm may
further be provided with a robot arm portion which is
variable in length and pivotable with respect to a further
robot arm portion coupled to a frame beam of the robot arm.
In a specific embodiment, in the period when a teat cup is
carried by the robot arm, the teat cup can be translated in 
three directions and is rotatable around a pivot.The construction as described above makes it
possible to arrange the implement such that, after the teat
cups are connected to the teats, during milking the animal
can freely move with respect to the robot arm in the limited
space of the milking parlour. When the animal has the
possibility to move in the milking parlour, advantageously a
sensor may be provided near the rear side of the animal,
which sensor defines a reference point, the teat cup being
automatically moved from a position outside the milking
parlour to a position under the animal defined relative to
said reference point. Particularly, the position of a teat
cup relative to the reference point is determined by the
position of the teat cup relative to a robot arm frame beam
to which the robot arm is movably connected and the position
of said frame beam

<CLAIMS>
An implement for milking animals, such as cows,
comprising a milking parlour, a robot arm (7) being able to

carry teat cups (80), detection means (75) with the aid of
which the position of a teat of an animal is determined, and

control means (14, 41, 49, 58, 64) for conveying the robot
arm (7) from a position outside the milking parlour in such a

position under the animal's udder that a teat cup (80) can be
connected to an animal's teat, the robot arm (7) further

comprising one or more teat cup carriers (76), each of which
can carry a teat cup, characterized in that an operating cylinder

(72) is provided for automatically pulling after milking said
teat cup against the teat cup

carrier (76) by means of a flexible connecting member (81),
connecting member (81), and that the implement is adapted to produce

a vacuum inside the teat cup when the teat cup is moved
upwardly, so that the teat cup sucks to the teat, thereafter

the operating cylinder (72) can be operated in such a way that
the teat cup (80) can move freely relative to the robot arm

(7) and remains connected to the teat of the udder. 
An implement as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that a robot arm end portion (62) is provided with means

(86) to catch a teat cup (80) when the milking has ended.
An implement as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that the robot arm (7) is provided with a robot arm

portion (61, 62) which is variable in length and pivotable
with respect to a further robot arm portion (53) coupled to a

frame beam (6) of the robot arm (7).
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the period when a teat cup

(80) is carried by the robot arm (7), the teat cup (80) can
be translated in three directions and is rotatable around a

pivot (112).
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, after the teat cups (80) are

connected to the teats, during milking the animal can freely
move with respect to the robot arm (7) in the limited space

of the milking parlour.
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a sensor (5) is provided near 

the rear side of the animal, which sensor (5) defines a
reference point, the teat cup (80) being automatically moved

from a position outside the milking parlour to a position
under the animal defined relative to said reference point.
An implement as claimed in claim 6, characterized
in that the position of a teat cup (80) relative to the

reference point is determined by the position of the teat cup
(80) relative to a robot arm frame beam (6) to which the

robot arm (7) is movably connected and the position of said
frame beam (6) relative to said reference point.
An implement as claimed in claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that, when a teat cup (80) is automatically moved

to a position under the animal relative to said reference
point, the detection means (75) are capable to scan a region

so as to check whether a teat is located therein.
An implement as claimed in claim 8, characterized
in that the robot arm (7) is capable of connecting the teat

cups (80) individually by an upward movement of each teat cup
from a position under an animal's teat at which a respective

teat cup is moved after the detection of said teat by the
detection means (75).
An implement as claimed in claim 9, characterized
in that a blocking mechanism is provided, which unblocks the

milking hose (101) of a teat cup (80) when this teat cup (80)
is moved upwardly and blocks said milking hose (101) after

milking.
