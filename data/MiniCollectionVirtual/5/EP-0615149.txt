<ABSTRACT>
The side-arm knuckle (20) of the elastic hinge for spectacles is prolonged by a slide (30) which can move in a housing (10,12) in an elastic manner against the action of a spring (40) lodged in a central longitudinal slot (34) in the slide and acting between a transverse stop (44) fastened to the housing and the rear end of the slide (32). This side-arm knuckle (20) and the slide (30) are made in two pieces of different material, and then assembled. The slide (30) is, especially, a tube of elongate rectangular cross-section and the knuckle (20) has a rear body (22) in which a slit (26) is made, designed to receive the lateral front end face of the slide.

Elastic hinge for spectacles, the side-member knuckle
(20) of which is extended by a slide (30) which is movable

in a casing (10, 12) in an elastic manner against the
action of a spring (40) housed in a longitudinal central

opening (34) in the slide and acting between a transverse
stop (44) integral with the casing and the rear end (32) of

the slide, characterised in that the side-member knuckle
(20) and the slide (30) are produced in two distinct

pieces, in that the slide (30) is a tube of elongated
rectangular cross-section, in that the knuckle (20) has a

rear body (22) in which a slot (26) intended for receiving
the lateral face of the front end of the slide is formed,

and in that the material of the slide has mechanical
behaviour such as that of the steel marketed under the name

"INOX".
Hinge according to claim 1, characterised in that the
height of the rear body (22) of the knuckle at the level of

the slot (26) is at least equal to one and a half times the
height of the slide (30).
Hinge according to claim 2, characterised in that the
rear body (22) of the knuckle has a substantially constant

height, and in that a cover (12), which combines with the
flat face of the end (10) of the side-member to form the

casing, has a first entrance passage (16) with a constant
height corresponding to that of the knuckle body (22),

followed by a housing (18) with a cross-section
corresponding to the height and width of the slide (30).
Hinge according to claim 3, characterised in that each
lateral face of the knuckle body (22) is complemented by a

guide stud (28) fitting respectively into a guide groove 
(14) formed longitudinally in each lower part of the

lateral face of the first entrance passage (16).
Hinge according to claim 1, characterised in that the
tube of elongated rectangular cross-section constituting

the slide is produced in steel marketed under the name
"INOX".
Hinge according to claim 5, characterised in that the
thickness of the wall of the tube constituting the slide is

between 0.12 and 0.25 millimetre, and the height of the
said wall is between 1 and 21 millimetres.
