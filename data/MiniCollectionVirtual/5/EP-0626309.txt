<ABSTRACT>
A support structure for a self-standing storage tank 
used in a liquefied gas carrier ship is disclosed. The 

carrier ship comprises a hold (2) for housing the storage 
tank (3). Between a bottom section (3b) of the tank and a 

bottom surface (2b) of the hold (2), lateral movement 
restraining devices (6) for restraining the lateral movements 

of the tank and fore-aft movement restraining devices (20) 
for restraining the longitudinal movements of the tank are 

disposed. Between a roof section (3a) of the tank (3) and a 
roof surface (2a) of the hold (2), only lateral movement 

restraining devices (6) are disposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support structure for 
a self-standing storage tank used in a liquefied gas carrier 
ship, and more specifically, to a technology which avoids 
problems due to relative movements of a self-standing storage 
tank and a ship's hull of the liquefied gas carrier ship in 
the forward and rearward directions, and which improves 
support of the self-standing storage tank during the movement 
thereof. Techniques relating to liquefied gas carrier ships have 
been disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application, 
First Publication No. 2-249796, Japanese Patent Application, 
First Publication No. 4-8999, Japanese Patent Application, 
First Publication No. 4-92794, and Japanese Patent 
Application, First Publication No. 4-143187. An example of these types of liquefied gas carrier ships 
is shown in Figs. 10 and 11. This carrier ship has a double 
casing type (armored-type) ship's hull 1 including a outer 
shell 1A and an inner shell 1B, and rectangular-shaped 
storage tanks 3 in holds 2 of the ship's hull 1. The storage 
tank 3 has a self-standing structure which is independent of 
the inner shell 1B. By this structure, a carrier ship may be 
contemplated in which a deck 12 is flattened, the storage 
capacity is increased, safety during an accident (such as 
running aground) is improved, and reliability in carrying a 
stored liquid, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), is  
 
improved. Each of the storage tanks 3 is placed on a plurality of 
support blocks 4, as shown in Fig. 11, so that the weight of 
the tank 3 is distributed. Between the inner shell 1B and 
the tank 3, fore-aft movement restraining devices for 
restraining the movement of the tank 3 in the forward and 
rearward directions, and lateral movement restraining devices 
for restraining the movement of the tank 3 in the 
port-starboard directions, are disposed. More specifically, 
the fore-aft movement restraining devices and the lateral 
movement restraining devices are disposed between a roof 
surface 2a of the hold 2 and a roof section 3a of the tank 3, 
and between a bottom surface 2b of the hold 2 and a bottom 
section 3b of the tank 3. Fig. 12 shows the fore-aft movement restraining devices 
5 and the lateral movement restraining devices 6, which are 
disposed between the roof surface 2a of the hold 2 and the 
roof section 3a of the tank 3. The fore-aft movement 
restraining devices 5 are aligned in the port-starboard 
directions (the widthwise direction of the ship), defining 
the center of a tank dome 9

A support structure for a self-standing 
storage tank (3) used in a liquid-transport carrier 

ship, said self-standing storage tank having a roof 
section (3a), a bottom section (3b), and a tank dome 

(9) disposed at the upper part of said tank for passing 
lines into said tank, wherein said support structure 

comprises 

a hold (2) for housing said self-standing 
storage tank (3), said self-standing storage 

tank being carried in said hold (2) in a self-standing 
state, and said hold having a roof surface (2a) facing 

said roof section of said tank and a bottom surface 
(2b) facing said bottom section of said tank ; 
lateral movement restraining devices (6) 
for restraining movements of said tank in the widthwise 

direction of said ship ; and 
fore-aft movement restraining devices 
(20) for restraining movements of said tank in the 

fore-aft direction of said ship ; 
said support structure for a self-standing 
storage tank characterized in that : 
said lateral movement restraining 
devices (6) are disposed between said bottom section 

(3b) of said tank and said bottom surface (2b) of said 
hold, and between said roof section (3a) of said tank 

and said roof surface (2a) of said hold, said lateral 
movement restraining devices being aligned along the 

widthwise center line of said tank, and 
said fore-aft movement restraining 
devices (20) are disposed only between said bottom 

section (3b) of said tank and said bottom surface (2b) 
of said hold, said fore-aft movement restraining  

 
devices being aligned in the widthwise direction of 

said tank, 
wherein said fore-aft movement 
restraining devices (20) and said lateral movement 

restraining devices (6B) which are disposed at the 
lower part of said tank, and said lateral movement 

restraining devices (6A) which are disposed at the 
upper part of said tank, are arranged such that any 

line (X, Y) drawn through said fore-aft movement 
restraining devices and said lateral movement 

restraining devices intersects said tank dome (9) in 
plan view, and thereby said support structure is 

defined such that the position corresponding to said 
tank dome is anchored as the restraining base point (S) 

of movement of said tank.
