The film properties are attributed to controlled introduction in the film of defects of predetermined size and distribution. Defects of from about 0.4  mu m, present in numbers per cm

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magneto-optic films, 
methods of preparing same and devices incorporating such 
films. Magneto-optic films and/or various devices utilizing 
same have been described in the following patents, the 
teaching of which is incorporated herein by reference 
thereto: U.S. Patents 4,497,545; 4,500,176 and 4,500,177, 
directed to spatial light modulators. U.S. Patents 4,625,167 
and 4,755,752, directed to crack detection devices; U.S. 
Patent 4,728,178, directed to switches, modulators; U.S. 
Patent 4,604,577, directed to magnetic field sensors; and, 
U.S. Patents 3,838,450; 3,989,352 and 4,608,742, directed to 
memory and recording/modulator devices. Magneto-optic films 
have also been used in optical isolators, see e.g., Fujitsu 
Science & Tech. Journal, Vo. 26, No. 26. Such films may also 
find utility in rotation sensors for brakes. One of the drawbacks of monocrystalline ferromagnetic 
oxide films have been the low coercivity (less than 1 Oe) of 
such films. See, e.g., Hansen et al. "Media for Erasable 
Magneto-optic Recording" IEEE Trans. Mag., Volume 25, pp. 
4390-4404. As an alternative to the low coercivity 
monocrystalline ferromagnetic films the art has produced 
ferromagnetic polycrystalline films. Such magnetic-optic 
films have been prepared utilizing sputtering, vapor 
deposition or spray pyrolysis. However, such polycrystalline 
films have coercivity values of 200-2,000 Oe. These values 
are too high for the applications which the films of the 
present invention find utility, because of the high switch 
fields required. The herein invention resides in the discovery that 
monocrystalline ferromagnetic oxide films having good square 
shaped hysteresis loops of predetermined coercivity can be 
produced by imparting to such films defects of controlled  
 
size, number, and distribution. The present invention 
enables replicable production of monocrystalline 
ferromagnetic oxide films which operate at low switch fields. 
The present invention now allows retention of the desirable 
properties of monocrystalline ferromagnetic oxide films while 
modifying the low coercivity levels characteristic to such 
materials and providing a readily switchable film shaving a 
good square shaped hysteresis loop. In accordance with the present invention, bistable 
magneto-optic films of predetermined switching field are 
produced by introducing defects (1) within and/or (2) on the 
surface of such films and/or (3) at the interface of such 
films with substrates. The predetermined
