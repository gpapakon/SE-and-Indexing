<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to CATV systems generally
and more particularly to non program applications thereof.There are known in the patent literature various
proposals for gambling systems employing telecommunications.U.S. Patent 4,602,279 describes a method for providing
targeted profile interactive CATV displays.U.S. Patent 4,654,482 describes a home merchandise
ordering telecommunications terminal which employs a bar-code
reader and a merchandise catalog.U.S. Patent 4,669,730 describes an automated
sweepstakes-type game which is designed to be used on banking
system computer terminals such as ATM or POS terminals.U.S. Patent 4,797,913 describes a direct telephone dial
ordering service system in which a calling customer can order
products and/or services from a given vendor without voice
intervention using a telephone as a subscriber interface device.U.S. Patent 4,856,787 describes a concurrent game
network in which a master game terminal is connected in a
computer network with a plurality of slave game terminals. The
terminals include touch screen display.U.S. Patents 4,882,473 and 4,764,666 describe an on-line
wagering system with programmable game entry cards and
operator security cards which employs a smart card in a special
purpose terminal which is located at a gaming station. The
terminals in the various gaming stations are interconnected by
conventional data links. The smart cards are personalized for
each participant and for operators. This system is also described
in an article entitled "Lotteries and Smart Cards, by Cliff

Applications and Technology, pp 165 - 171.An article entitled "Application of Card Technology to
the casino Environment" by Walter H. Wellman, SCAT '89,
Conference Proceedings: Smart Card Applications and Technology,
pp 172 - 182, describes the use of smart cards in gaming.U.S. Patent 4,996,705 describes the use of
telecommunications systems for lotteries and describes a
telephone-based system employing an operator who speaks with the
customer.None of the above-mentioned prior art patents relate to
CATV systems.In an article entitled "An Evolutionary Approach to the
Development of Two-Way Cable Technology Communications", by James
B. Wright et al, IEEE Transactions on Cable Television, Vol CATV-2,
No. 1, January 1977, the development of two-way CATV systems
is proposed for various applications, including shopping.In a publication entitled "VideoGuard Secure Pay-TV
