<ABSTRACT>
A fastening arrangement for a vehicle seat (4) includes floor 
fastening elements (20, 21) connected to the vehicle floor and 

corresponding seat fastening devices (26, 27) attached to the 
seat (4). The fastening elements (20, 26) situated furthest 

from the door form in the assembled position a push-in 
connection. To this end, the floor fastening element (20) has 

a hole (15) through it and the seat fastening element (26) is 
provided with a protruding peg (32). The seat is introduced 

through the door at an angle to the horizontal plane, and the 
seat fastening element (26) of the push-in connection includes 

guiding teeth (33) which are applied to a floor guide device 
(14). The seat (4) is thereafter moved along the guide devoce 

so that the peg (32) is introduced into the hole (15) in the 
floor fastening element (20). The opposite side of the seat 

(4) is then pressed down so that the seat fastening element 
(27) on that side is brought into contact with the floor 

fastening element (21). The seat (4) is locked in the final 
position by means of a bolt which is fitted by a robot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an arrangement for fastening a
seat to a seat base in a vehicle (see for example EP-A-0 171 660,
corresponding to the preamble of claim 1).The motor vehicle industry is constantly looking for ways to
reduce production costs. Automation of assembly by means of
robots has been the solution for many operations. However, it
has not been possible to robotise certain kinds of assembly
work because robots require a certain working space and cannot
travel along absolutely geometrical paths without being
hindered by elements of bodywork. This has resulted in some
work having still to be carried out manually at a very high
assembly cost compared with automated operations. An example
of such an operation is the fitting of vehicle seats. The
actual fastening of a seat to the floor does not of itself
involve any real problem. This is commonly achieved by bolted
connections at the four corners of the seat, with the bolts
normally firmly screwed vertically into corresponding mounting
holes. The real difficulty lies in the small space available
for assembly movements under the seat, which means that robots
cannot be used, that the working position for fitters is
awkward and ergonomically incorrect and that the time and cost
of the work are very great. A further disadvantage that may be
cited is that positioning the seat very often causes problems
and that many minor adjusting movements may be required before
the correct position is achieved.EP-A2-0356004 has attempted to remedy the abovementioned
disadvantages and indicate a method and a fastening arrangement
which permit robotisation of the seat fastening operation.
This involves bolted connections being used to secure the seat,
and the seat frame having external fastening lugs provided with 
holes which allow screws to be inserted and the seat to be
secured to the floor. Unfortunately, the known technique
involves a number of disadvantages in that it requires the seat
to be made collapsible so that the fastening lugs situated on
the sides can be reached by the robot's assembling device or by
the fitter. This means inter alia that a special track has to
be designed and that the seat has to be provided with locking
devices which cooperate with corresponding locking devices in
the frame in order to prevent the seat swinging up and down.
This leads to the known design having a considerable production
cost and to there having to be additional special manual
hinging-up and hinging-down operations.The above-mentioned EP-A-0 171 660 (A1) shows

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for fastening a seat (4) to a seat base (9) in
a vehicle where the seat (4) has fastening elements (26, 27)

firmly attached to it for locking cooperation with
corresponding fastening elements (20, 21) firmly attached to

the seat base (9), at least one fastening element (26) attached
to the seat forms a push-in connection in conjunction with the

corresponding fastening element (20) attached to the base, the
fastening element forming the push-in connection includes on

one fastening element a peg (32) which engages in a
corresponding hole (15) in the other fastening element, each of

the other fastening elements (27) attached to the seat forms
with the corresponding fastening element (21) attached to the

base and at least one locking element (35) a locking connection
which is accessible from outside the vehicle 
characterised
 in
that the fastening element (20) attached to the seat base (9)

is resilient and that the peg (32) is subjected, after fitting
the seat, to a spring force by the aforesaid fastening element

(20) attached to the base, and in that the fastening element (20) attached to the base has
in each of the locking connections an inclined guiding surface

which cooperates with a corresponding inclined guiding surface
(30) incorporated in the fastening element (27) attached to the

seat in such a way that a wedge effect is established when the

surfaces are brought together, the wedge effect and the spring
force causing a playfree fastening of the seat to the seat

base.
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the
resilient fastening element (20) takes the form of a plate

which in the unloaded state forms a small angle with the
vertical plane.
Arrangement according to claims 1-2, 
characterised
 in that
the hole (15) is in the fastening element (20) attached to the

seat base (9). 
Arrangement according to claims 1-3, 
characterised
 in that
the fastening devices (20,21) attached to the base take the

form of shanks on one or more fastening strips (14) firmly
connected to the floor.
Arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterised
 in that the
strip or strips (14) between the shanks (20, 21) situated on

both sides include an assembly guide device (17,18) and that at
least one of the two corresponding fastening devices (20, 21)

attached to the seat is provided with a complementary guide
device which engages with the assembly guide device of the

strip or strips.
Arrangement according to claim 5, 
characterised
 in that the
complementary guide device consists of at least one protruding

tooth (33, 34) which engages with at least one guiding wall
(17, 18) on the assembly guide device.
Arrangement according to claims 1-6, 
characterised
 in that
two fastening strips (14) are combined with at least two

elongated frame portions (13) so as to form a mainly
rectangular frame and that the frame portions (13) are secured

to the vehicle.
