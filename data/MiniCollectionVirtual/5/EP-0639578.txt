prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid or metal salt thereof, an 

amine and a source of cationic molybdenum, wherein the ratio of the 
number of equivalents of acid groups to the number of moles of 

molybdenum (eq : mol) is in the range from 1 : 10 to 10 : 1, and 
the ratio of the number of equivalents of acid groups to the number 

of moles of amine (eq : mol) is in the range from 20 : 1 to 1 : 10; 
a process for their preparation; lubricating oil compositions 

containing them; and their use as friction-reducing additives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molybdenum-containing
complexes, a process for their preparation, lubricating oil
compositions containing them, and their use as friction-reducing
additives.It is well known in the art that the properties of lubricating
oils for internal combustion engines can be improved by the
addition of molybdenum-containing materials having anti-wear and/or
friction-reducing properties. Anti-wear materials prevent or slow
down the wear that occurs between metal surfaces which are in close
rubbing contact, particularly in the boundary lubrication regime
where metal to metal contact occurs. They are known to work by
forming a permanent film on the surface metal which protects it
from wear phenomena which would otherwise lead to removal of metal,
loss of performance and eventual welding together of metal parts.
Friction-reducing materials act by reducing the friction between
metal surfaces when they rub together, resulting in improved fuel
economy. They are known to give benefit in both the hydrodynamic
and boundary lubrication regimes.These molybdenum-containing materials typically contain a
source of active sulphur. In Column 1, line 53 to Column 2, line 2
of US-A-4,692,256 it is stated: "It has been considered essential
that organic molybdenum compounds useful as lubricant additives
should contain sulfur atoms in the molecules of the compounds.
That is, it has been considered that the lubricating performance
can be obtained by the formation of molybdenum disulfide on the
lubricating surface by molybdenum and sulfur contained in the
molecules. However, the present inventors have assumed that active
sulfur atoms contained in the molecules may have undesirable
effects in view of the metal corrosion and have made an earnest
study in order to overcome the contraction. As a result, it has 
surprisingly been found that although the product obtained by the
reaction between a molybdenum compound and an amino compound has no
substantial performance when used alone as a lubricant additive, it
exhibits extremely satisfactory lubricating performance when
combined with a sulfur-containing compound.". Examples of such
sulphur-containing compounds are said in Column 4, lines 11 to 19
to include sulphurised fatty acids, sulphurised oils and fats,
sulphurised olefins, disulphide compound such as dibenzyl sulphide,
dithiocarbamate such as butylphenyl thiocarbamate disulphide,
phosphorous- and sulphur-containing compounds such as
tetraalkylthioperoxy phosphate, molybdenum dithiocarbamate,
molybdenum
