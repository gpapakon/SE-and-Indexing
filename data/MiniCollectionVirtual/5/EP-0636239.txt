<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a plate heat exchanger for heat transfer between two fluids, comprising several thin heat transfer plates (1) abutting towards each other and between the heat transfer plates (1) arranged sealing members (6), which in alternate plate interspace delimit a flow space for a first fluid and in the remaining plate interspaces delimit flow spaces for a second fluid, each heat transfer plate (1) having a pressed corrugation pattern, which has two distribution portions (7, 8) and, arranged between these, a main heat transfer portion (9), which is divided in several areas (10a, 10b) with parallel ridges and valleys, and the plate heat exchanger having inlets and outlets for said fluids, arranged such that the fluids will have a flow direction between the heat transfer plates (1) essentially from one to the other of the distribution portions (7, 8) at each heat transfer plate. According to the invention the heat transfer portion (9) of each heat transfer plate (1) comprises a row with at least three areas (10a, 10b) located after each other in said flow direction and an even number of such rows are arranged next to each other across the flow direction, by which the parallel ridges and valleys of each pair of adjacent areas (10a, 10b) extend in such a way that they form mirror images of each other with reference to an imaginary line between respective areas (10a, 10b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a heat transfer plate for a plate heat
exchanger for heat transfer between two fluids, and to a plate heat exchanger
including several such plates. More particularly the invention refers to a plate heat
exchanger comprising several thin heat transfer plates abutting against each other
with sealing members arranged therebetween to delimit in alternate plate
interspaces flow spaces for a first fluid and in the remaining plate interspaces flow
spaces for a second fluid, each heat transfer plate having a pressed corrugation
pattern including two distribution portions and, arranged between these, a main
heat transfer portion, which is divided into several areas with parallel ridges and
valleys, the plate heat exchanger having inlets and outlets for said fluids so
arranged that the fluids will have a flow direction, between the heat transfer plates,
essentially from one to the other of the distribution portions of each heat transfer
plate, the areas of the main heat exchange portion being disposed in a plurality of
rows extending in the flow direction, and the parallel ridges and valleys of each
pair of adjacent areas extending so that they form mirror images of each other with
reference to an imaginary line between the respective areasFrom GB-A-1468514 a plate heat exchanger for heat transfer between two
fluids is previously known, which is assembled of several heat transfer plates
arranged such that the fluids flow on both sides of the plates. The heat transfer
plates have a pressed corrugation pattern with an upper distribution portion and
a lower distribution portion and, arranged between these, a main heat transfer
portion. The heat transfer portion comprises a pressed corrugation pattern with
parallel ridges and valleys and is formed with several band like areas, extending
along the plates. Between the heat transfer plates sealing members are arranged,
which in alternate plate interspace delimit a flow space for a first fluid and in the
remaining plate interspaces delimit flow spaces for a second fluid. From GB-A-1339542 a plate heat exchanger for heat transfer between two
fluids is previously known. which is assembled of several heat transfer plates
arranged such that fluids flow on each sides of these. The heat transfer plates have
two distribution portions and, arranged between these, a main heat transfer
portion. The heat transfer portion comprises a press corrugation pattern with
parallel ridges and valleys and is formed with several band like areas, extending
across

<CLAIMS>
A heat transfer plate (1) for a plate heat exchanger, comprising inlets
(2,4) and outlets (3,5) for at least two heat transfer fluids two distribution portions

(7,8) and, arranged between them, a heat transfer portion (9), the inlets (2,4) and
the outlets (3,5) being arranged such that said fluids will have a flow direction

essentially from one to the other of the distribution portions (7,8) and the heat
transfer portion (9) being provided with a pressed corrugation pattern divided into

several areas (10a, 10b) having parallel ridges and valleys, the areas being disposed
in a plurality of rows extending in the flow direction, and in each pair (10a, 10b)

of adjacent areas in the same row and in adjacent rows the parallel ridges and
valleys extending so that they form mirror images of each other with reference to

an imaginary line between the respective areas (10a, 10b), characterised in that the
heat transfer portion (9) comprises rows with an odd number of at least three areas

(10a, 10b) located in series in said flow direction, there being an even number of
such rows arranged next to each other across the flow direction.
A heat transfer plate according to claim 1, characterised in that the
parallel ridges and valleys of each pair of adjacent areas (10a, 10b) extend with an

intermediate angle which is obtuse in relation to the flow direction.
