<ABSTRACT>
An AC motor control circuit particularly suitable 
for motors having permanent magnet rotors, and stators which 

are supplied with AC current from an inverter. A current 
detection (33) detects the DC current input to the inverter 

(29) and produces an output signal which is supplied to a 
power factor calculation circuit (36). The output from this 

circuit is supplied to a voltage and frequency calculation 
circuit (38) whose output is in turn supplied to a drive 

circuit (38) which produces pulse-width-modulated drive 
signals for the transistors of the inverter (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control device for an AC 
motor using an inverter circuit. Control devices for AC motors may be of very many 
different types, depending on the type of the AC motor to be 
controlled. This invention is concerned with a device for controlling 
induction motors and brushless motors equipped with a rotor of 
the permanent magnet type. First of all, a device for controlling a brushless motor 
will be described. To control brushless motors, instead of employing a 
position detection element such as a Hall element to detect 
the relative position of the stator winding and permanent 
magnet type rotor, a system has come to be employed wherein 
this position is detected by using the terminal voltages, 
which contain the induced voltages generated in the stator 
winding. A prior art example of this is shown in Fig. 5 1 is a 
DC current source. 2 is an inverter circuit for passing 
current to stator windings 3U, 3V and 3W of brushless motor 3. 
4, 5 and 6 are filter curciut that shift by 90 degress the 
phase of terminal voltages UV, VV, and WV containing the 
induced voltages generated in stator windings 3U, 3V and 3W. 
7 is a detection circuit whereby the neutral point voltage NV 
is obtained from the output signals of these filter circuits 4 
to 6. 8, 9 and 10 are comparators that respectively compare 
the output signals of filter circuits 4 to 6, which constitute 
first order delay elements, and neutral point voltage NV. 11  
 
is a control circuit. Fig. 6 is a time chart showing the operation of the 
prior art example. We shall now consider the U phase with 
reference to this time chart. During commutation of the 
inverter circuit 2 the terminal voltage UV (see Fig. 6 (a)) 
generated in stator winding 3U contains a voltage spike that 
is produced by conduction of the opposite arm return flow 
diode. In order to eliminate the effect of this voltage spike 
component, the terminal voltage UV is shifted in phase by 90 
degrees by means of filter circuit 4, producing the phase-shifted 
voltage DUV as shown in Fig. 6 (b). After this, this 
phase-shifted voltage DUV and the neutral point voltage NV 
shown in Fig. 6 (b) are compared by comparator 8, to obtain a 
phase detection signal PSU as shown in Fig. 6C. The situation 
is the same for the other phases V and W, position detection 
signals PSV and PSW being obtained as shown in Fig. 6(d) and 
(e) from comparators 9 and 10, based on terminal voltages VV 
and VW. These position detection signals PSU, PSV and PSW are 
signals that are 120
