<ABSTRACT>
The shoe includes at least one trailing spreader chute (7) suspended from a chassis with an inclination at an acute angle relative to the ground and to the direction of forward travel, and a circular coulter (8) placed vertically ahead of the chute and in the axis of the latter. The trailing chute (7) has an anterior end with a tapered profile. A system of springs (15, 17) which act in cascade ensures that a satisfactory working height is maintained regardless of the operating pressure applied to the shoe.
