Process for the production of a two-coat 
finish, in which 


(1) a pigmented basecoat is applied to the substrate 
surface, 
(2) a polymer film is formed from the basecoat 
applied in step (1), 
(3) a non-aqueous transparent topcoat is applied 
to the resulting basecoat layer, which topcoat 

comprises 

(A) a synthetic resin containing hydroxyl 
groups or a mixture of synthetic resins 

containing hydroxyl groups, 
(B) an amino resin or a mixture of amino 
resins, and 
(C) a blocked polyisocyanate or a mixture of 
blocked polyisocyanates 

and subsequently 
(4) basecoat layer and topcoat layer are baked 
together, 
 
characterized in that, in step (3), a 

transparent topcoat is employed in 
which component (C) comprises isocyanate 

groups blocked both with a blocking agent (I) 
and with a blocking agent (II), 


the blocking agent (I) being a dialkyl malonate or 
a mixture of dialkyl malonates, 
the blocking agent (II) being a blocking agent 
which is different from (I) and contains active 

methylene groups, an oxime or a mixture of these 
blocking agents, and 
component (C) being preparable by reacting at 
least 50 per cent of the isocyanate groups of a 

polyisocyanate or of a mixture of polyisocyanates 
with a mixture of the blocking agents (I) and 

(II), the mixture of the blocking agents (I) and 
(II) containing the blocking agents (I) and (II) 

in a molar ration which is between 1.0:1.0 and 
9.0:1.0. 
Non-aqueous coatings comprising 

(A) a synthetic resin containing hydroxyl groups 
or a mixture of synthetic resins containing 

hydroxyl groups, 
(B) an amino resin or a mixture of amino resins, 
and 
(C) a blocked polyisocyanate or a mixture of 
blocked polyisocyanates 
 
characterized in that component (C) comprises isocyanate 

groups blocked both with a blocking agent (I) 
and with a blocking agent (II), 


the blocking agent (I) being a dialkyl malonate or 
a mixture of dialkyl malonates, 
the blocking agent (II) being a blocking agent 
which is different from (I) and contains active 

methylene groups, an oxime or a mixture of these 
blocking agents, and 
component (C) being preparable by reacting at 
least 50 per cent of the isocyanate groups of a 

polyisocyanate or of a mixture of polyisocyanates 
with a mixture of the blocking agents (I) and 

(II), the mixture of the blocking agents (I) and 
(II) containing the blocking agents (I) and (II) 

in a molar ration which is between 1.0:1.0 and 
9.0:1.0. 
Process or coatings according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that component (A) has a hydroxyl 

number of from 40 to 240, preferably 60 to 150, and is 
present in an amount of from 50 to 90, preferably 60 to 

75, % by weight, and component (B) is present in an 
amount of from 5 to 45, preferably 10 to 25, % by 

weight, and component (C) is present in an amount of 
from 5 to 45, preferably 10 to 25, % by weight, the per 

centages by weight being based on (A) + (B) + (C) = 
100% by weight. 
Process or coatings according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the blocked isocyanate 

groups contained in component (C) are attached to 
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic radicals.  

 
Process or coatings according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that component (C) comprises 

blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, blocked isophorone 
diisocyanate or a mixture of blocked hexamethylene 

diisocyanate and blocked isophorone diisocyanate. 
Process or coatings according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the blocking agent (I) is 

diethyl malonate. 
Process or coatings according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the blocking agent which 

is different from (I) and contains active methylene 
groups is an alkyl acetoacetate having 1 to 6 carbon 

atoms in the alkyl moiety or a mixture of such alkyl 
acetoacetates, preferably ethyl acetoacetate. 
Process or coatings according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the blocking agent (II) 

is methyl ethyl ketoxime. 
Process or coatings according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that component (C) can be 

prepared by reacting at least 50 per cent of the 
isocyanate groups of a polyisocyanate or of a mixture 

of polyisocyanates with a mixture of the blocking 
agents (I) and (II), the mixture of the blocking agents 

(I) and (II) comprising the blocking agents (I) and 
(II) in a molar ratio which is between 8.0:2.0 and 

6.0:4.0, preferably between 7.5:2.5 and 6.5:3.5. 
Use of the coatings according to Claim 2 to 9 
as transparent topcoats in a process for the production 

of a two-coat finish, in which 

(1) a pigmented basecoat is applied to the substrate 
surface, 
(2) a polymer film is formed from the basecoat applied 
in step (1), 
(3) a non-aqueous transparent topcoat is applied to 
the resulting basecoat layer, and 

subsequently 
(4) basecoat layer and topcoat layer are baked 
together.
