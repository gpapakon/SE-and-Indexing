<ABSTRACT>
A cache memory control system includes a circuit 
for clearing valid bits of data and address data, both of 

which are stored in a cache memory (20), a circuit (1) for 
outputting a signal representing valid bits are being 

cleared, and a circuit for changing the cache memory (20) from 
cache access status to cache bypass status in response to 

the signal representing that the valid bits are being 
cleared.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cache memory 
control system. Cache memories are small-capacity, high-speed 
buffer memories arranged between processors and main 
memories and are very popular in medium and high speed 
computer systems for effectively shortening main memory 
access time under the control of processors. The principle of cache memories is described in 
detail in Computing Survey, Vol. 14, No. 3, PP. 473 - 530, 
1982 and is based on an empirical rule wherein "locality" 
is present in main memory access, i.e., referencing of a 
main memory address space by a program. The above reference describes "locality means 
that the loci of reference of the program in the near 
feature are likely to be near the current loci of 
reference." By utilizing this property of locality, the 
contents of successive memory locations (to be referred to 
as a block) having a predetermined size and including a 
word currently accessed from the CPU to the main memory are 
fetched from the main memory to the cache memory. Only 
high-speed cache memory access is then required, and 
low-speed main memory access need not be performed.  Conventional cache memories have the following 
disadvantages. Each entry of the cache memory consists of data, 
an address tag representing a data location in the main 
memory or a real address, and a valid bit representing 
validity of the data. Since the cache memory comprises a 
random access memory (RAM), valid bits of all entries must 
be cleared when the cache memory system is powered or the 
virtual address space is changed. A conventional cache 
memory system includes a controller which controls the 
clearing of all the valid bits in accordance with a power-on 
signal or an instruction from the processor and 
acknowledges the end of clearing to the processor. The 
processor starts using the cache memory in response to a 
clear end acknowledgement signal from the controller. In 
this valid bit clear control system, the end of the 
clearing must be detected by the processor and the 
processor determines whether the cache memory can be 
accessed, thus undesirably increasing the overhead of the 
processor. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a cache memory control system for decreasing the 
overhead during the operation of a cache memory under the 
control of a processor when a memory is powered or a 
virtual address space is changed.  This object is achieved by 
a cache memory control system according to an 
aspect of the present invention comprises: a

<CLAIMS>
A cache memory control system comprising: a 
small-capacity cache memory arranged between a processor 

and a main memory to effectively shorten access time; 
   status changing means for changing status of 

memory data access performed by said processor into cache 
access status for using said cache memory or cache bypass 

status for bypassing said cache memory; 
   means for storing valid bits for representing 

validity of data and address information, both of which are 
stored in said cache memory; 

   means for clearing the valid bits; 
   means for outputting a signal representing that 

the valid bits are being cleared; and 
   means for changing said status changing means to 

the cache bypass status in response to the signal from said 
signal output means. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein said 
clearing means comprises a counter for starting a count 

operation in response to the signal representing that the 
valid bits are being cleared, a write controller for 

starting write access of said valid bit storing means in 
response to the signal from said signal output means, and a 

multiplexer, responsive to the signal from said signal 
 

output means, for supplying an output from said counter to 
said valid bit storing means as an address signal. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
signal output means comprises a register which is set in 

response to a clear command or a reset signal from said 
processor and which is reset in response to a count end 

signal from said counter.
