<ABSTRACT>
Shower gel compositions in the form of a liquid or gel comprising 5-50 % wt of a detergent comprising 30-100 % wt (on total detergent) of a fatty acyl isethionate and 0-70 % wt (on total detergent) of other detergent, 0.01-5 % on product of cationic polymer and 0.5-15 % wt by weight of silicone. The compositions show enhanced silicone deposition as compared with composition employing other surfactants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This inventions relates to detergent compositions in 
liquid or gel form suitable for personal washing of either 
skin or hair. It is known to include silicone in such compositions, 
either for hair conditioning or to enhance the feel of 
skin after washing. It is also known to include a 
cationic polymer along with the silicone. Japanese published application 3-81400 (Toyo Beauty KK) 
discloses washing compositions based on soap which also 
contain silicone oil and cationic polymer. EP-A-432951 describes shampoo formulations comprising 
sodium lauryl ether sulphate and betaine surfactants, 
Jaguar (RTM) cationic polymer and a silicone conditioner. 
EP-A-457688 (L'Oreal) discloses a shower gel which 
contains silicone oil an cationic polymer. GB-A-2114995 discloses a cleaning product for the hair and skin, 
based on acylisethionates and cationic polymers. We have now found that cationic polymer enhances the 
deposition of silicone from such compositions to a varying 
extent which depends on the detergent which is included in 
the composition. This invention concerns the synergistic 
interaction of silicones with selected surfactants. Deposition of silicone is enhanced by cationic polymer if 
the detergent in the compositions contains a substantial 
proportion of fatty acyl isethionate. Thus, according to the present invention there is provided 
a detergent composition in the form of an aqueous liquid 
or gel containing 5% to 50% by weight of detergent which 
comprises:  
 
(a) 30 to 100% by weight, based on the total 
detergent, of a fatty acyl isethionate of formula 
R-CO₂-CH₂CH₂-SO₃M 
   where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group of 7 to 21 
carbon atoms and M is a solubilising cation such as 
sodium, potassium, ammonium or substituted ammonium; (b) 0 to 70% by weight, based on the total 
detergent, of other detergent, 
ii) 0.01 to 5% by weight of cationic polymer iii) 0.5 to 15% by weight of silicone. Particularly preferred is a detergent mixture in which the 
acyl isethionate is accompanied by zwitterionic detergent. Acyl isethionates and the combination of acyl isethionates 
with zwitterionic detergents, such as betaines, are known 
components of many personal washing compositions. In the 
compositions of the present invention the surfactant 
systems are said to be mild in that they do not damage the 
stratum corneum, i.e. the outer layer of the skin. While 
not wishing to restrict the scope of the invention by 
reference to a theory of operation, it is believed that 
one would expect better deposition
