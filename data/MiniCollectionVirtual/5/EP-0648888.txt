<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a urethane polymer finish for 
textile fabrics utilized in window coverings such as 

pleated shades and vertical blinds. This finish for 
window coverings such as pleated shades and/or vertical 

blinds includes a urethane polymer made from a 
diisocyanate and either a polyester or a polyether soft 

segment. The diisocyanate may be either 
aromatic or aliphatic with an aliphatic diisocyanate 

preferred to prevent yellowing. The combination of 
these ingredients are is either carboxylated or 

emulsified and then neutralized. This urethane polymer 
may optionally include a halogenated moiety and such as 

a brominated monomer. Although a one hundred percent 
urethane polymer finish is preferred, the actual 

percentage of urethane polymer in the dried finish on 
the textile fabric may be as low as forty-five percent 

and still achieve some of the significant qualities of 
this urethane polymer finish. Some of the these 

significant qualities of this urethane polymer finish 
include shape retention, high softening point, flame 

retardancy, non-blocking, stiffness, non-yellowing and 
light fastness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a urethane polymer finish for 
textile fabrics utilized in window coverings such as 
pleated shades and vertical blinds. Window coverings 
such as pleated shades and/or vertical blinds that are 
formed of textile fabric as a base material allows for 
considerable aesthetic variation with regard to types 
of fabric utilized and the coloration thereof with the 
advantage of having material with a firm handle that is 
relatively durable. The problem with typical finishes for window coverings 
such as pleated shades and/or vertical blinds formed of 
textile fabric is that pleat retention dissipates at 
higher temperatures. With the utilization of these 
pleated shades and/or vertical blinds within motorized 
vehicles and other similar locations that are of a 
relatively high temperature, pleat retention becomes a 
crucial consideration. Another problem with typical finishes for window  
 
coverings such as pleated shades and/or vertical blinds 
formed of textile fabric is that formaldehyde, 
triethylamine, or ammonia is utilized. All of these 
chemicals can pose a hazard to the environment and the 
inhalation of formaldehyde has been deem by OSHA to be 
a health risk at a specified level. Yet another problem with typical finishes for window 
coverings such as pleated shades formed of textile 
material is that hysteresis loss is high. Still another problem with some typical finishes for 
window coverings such as pleated shades and/or vertical 
blinds formed of textile fabric is that typically they 
do not pass the ASTM 701 Vertical Flame Test and/or the 
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 302 Horizontal 
Flame Test without the specific addition of flame 
retardant chemicals that can significantly alter the 
chemical composition of the textile finish. Another problem with typical finishes for window 
coverings such as pleated shades and/or vertical blinds 
formed of textile fabric is that resistance to 
discoloration is low and light fastness is poor. Yet another problem with typical finishes for window 
coverings such as pleated shades formed of textile 
fabric it that typically the finished fabric will stick 
to itself in a condition that is technically known as 
"blocking" during the formation of the pleats. Another problem of typical finishes for window 
coverings such as pleated shades and/or vertical blinds 
formed of textile fabric is that the textile finish has 
a low softening point.  
 The present invention solves the above problems in a 
manner not disclosed in the
