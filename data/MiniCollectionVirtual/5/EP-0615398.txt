<ABSTRACT>
In electroacoustic transducer (1) having a diaphragm (5), with a partition wall (24), located behind the diaphragm (5), in which wall openings (25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, 30, 31, 32) passing through the partition wall are provided, and with a mask (37) resting against the partition wall, in which mask openings (38, 39, 40, 41) are provided which can be brought to coincide with different wall openings (25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, 30, 31, 32) in different relative positions between partition wall (24) and mask (37), the mask is formed in a simple manner by a flange (37) of a magnet system part (19) of the magnet system (16) of the transducer (1).

An electroacoustic transducer (1) having a diaphragm (5) constructed to 
be capable of vibration parallel to a transducer axis (9), which transducer comprises a 

partition wall (24) facing the back (13) of the diaphragm, which partition wall 
substantially extends transversely to the transducer axis (9) and is traversed by at least 

one partition opening (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) to form a passage between a first 
space (34) situated between the diaphragm (5) and one side (33) of the partition wall 

(24), and a second space (36) situated at the other side (35) of the partition wall (24), 
and a mask (37) arranged adjacent one of the two sides (33, 35) of the partition wall 

(24) and having at least one mask opening (38, 39, 40, 41) traversing it to form the 
passage between the two spaces (34, 36), which partition wall (24) and mask (37) can 

be brought into and fixed in at least two mutually rotated relative positions with respect 
to the transducer axis (9) in order to obtain different acoustically active cross-sectional 

areas of the passage between the two spaces (34, 36), which passage is formed by 
means of the openings (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 38, 39, 40, 41) in the partition 

wall (24) and in the mask (37), which openings can be made to coincide at least partly 
in the direction of the transducer axis (9), and a magnet system (16) comprising at least 

one magnet-system part (19), characterized in that the magnet-system part (19) of the 
magnet system (16) has a flange (37) which substantially extends transversely of the 

transducer axis (9), and the flange (37) of the magnet-system part (19) forms the mask 
(37) of the transducer (1), which mask has at least one mask opening (38, 39, 40, 41). 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that at least two of 
the partition openings (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) traversing the partition wall (24) 

differ with respect to their cross-sectional areas, and in the one relative position a mask 
opening (38, 39, 40, 41) formed in the mask (37) coincides with one of the different 

partition openings (25, 26, 27, 28) to form a passage between the two spaces (34, 36) 
and in the other relative position coincides with the other partition openings (29, 30, 31, 

32) to form another passage between the two spaces (34, 36).  
 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that at least two 
mask openings in the flange (37) differ with respect to their cross-sectional areas, and in 

the one relative position one of the partition openings formed in the partition coincides 
with one of the different mask openings to form a passage between the two spaces and 

in the other relative position coincides with the other ones of the mask openings to form 
another passage between the two spaces. 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that of said partition 
openings (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) of the partition which have different cross-sectional 

areas each opening (29, 30, 31, 32) having a smaller cross-sectional area is of 
circular cross-section, and the diameter of each such opening (29, 30, 31, 32) of 

circular cross-section is smaller than 0.3 mm in its acoustically active cross-sectional 
area. 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that of said mask 
openings of different cross-sectional areas each opening having a smaller cross-sectional 

area is of circular cross-section, and the diameter of each such opening of circular 
cross-section is smaller than 0.3 mm in its acoustically active cross-sectional area. 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the 
diameter of each such opening of circular cross-section is 0.2 mm in its acoustically 

active cross-sectional area. 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized in that each 
such opening of circular cross-section has a conical shape in its axial direction, parallel 

to the transducer axis.
