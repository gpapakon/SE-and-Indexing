<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dispense taps for beverages and 
other fluids and particularly relates to customer information 
displays for such dispense taps. Taps for pressure-fed beer dispense systems are conventionally 
attached to a bar counter by a so-called counter 
fitting that comprises a bracket mounted under or clamped to a 
bar counter and to which the shank of a dispense tap is attached. 
Such dispense taps have a tap handle pivoted to a tap 
body and arranged to open and close a valve in the tap body as 
the tap handle is operated between an open and a closed position. 
Typically an attractive display, a counter mount, is 
fitted to the top of the bar counter; to hide the dispense tap 
and advertise the beer available from that tap, or the like 
customer information. The counter mount is often illuminated, 
conventionally by a 12 or 24 volt festoon lamp; supplied by a 
mains transformer, provided under the counter. It is known to illuminate the handle of a dispense tap, 
see for example, US-A-2295468, US-A-2631393, US-A-3286385, US-A-3321861 
and US-A-4894647; in each case the light generating 
means, an incandescent light bulb, is contained within the tap 
handle. This raises problems of supplying electric power to 
the light bulb, of overheating the handle, of safety and 
requires a specially designed dispense tap; i.e. it is not 
possible to retrofit or convert existing dispense taps to have 
an illuminated handle. It is one object of the present invention to provide a 
combination of customer information display apparatus and 
dispense tap wherein the tap handle is illuminated in such 
manner as to overcome the above-stated problems. According to the present invention, in combination 
customer information display apparatus and a dispense tap, for 
beverages and other fluids, the dispense tap having a tap  
 
body, for attachment to a counter fitting, and an operating 
lever assembly with an illuminated tap handle, connected to a 
tap opening and closing mechanism in the tap body, wherein the 
operating lever assembly includes a tap handle formed of or 
including light transparent and/or light reflective material 
and a tap handle holder connected to the tap opening and 
closing mechanism; and, the display apparatus includes a light 
generator mounted on the tap handle holder, the tap body or 
the counter fitting, externally to the tap handle, and means 
to direct light from the light generator into or onto the tap 
handle; whereby, in use, the tap handle can be illuminated to 
display
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
In combination customer information display 
apparatus and a dispense tap, for beverages and 

other fluids, the dispense tap (10) having a 
tap body (28), for attachment to a counter 

fitting, and an operating lever assembly (12) 
with an illuminated tap handle (18), connected 

to a tap opening and closing mechanism (14) in 
the tap body, 
and characterised in that
the operating lever assembly includes 

a tap handle (18) formed of or 
including light transparent and/or 

light reflective material and 
a tap handle holder (12) connected to 
the tap opening and closing mechanism 

(14); and, 
the display apparatus includes 

a light generator (22,30) mounted on 
the tap handle holder (12), the tap 

body (28) or the counter fitting, 
externally to the tap handle, and 
means (34,36) to direct light from 
the light generator into or onto the 

tap handle; 
 
whereby, in use, the tap handle can be 

illuminated to display customer information. 
The combination of claim 1, 
and further 
characterised in that
 the tap handle (18) is 
formed of or includes light transparent 

material and the light director means (34,36) 
are arranged to direct light from the light 

generator (22,30) into the interior of the tap 
handle. 
The combination of claim 1 or claim 2 
and
further characterised in that
 the light 
generator is a lamp (30) contained within a 

light box (22) mounted on the tap body (28); 
the light box having a window (36) directed 

towards the tap handle (18). 
The combination of claim 2 and claim 3 
and 
further characterised in that
 the tap handle 
(18) has a root (16) which is socketed in the 

handle holder (12) such that a transparent part 
(20) of the tap handle faces the light box 

window (36) when the tap is closed; whereby, in 
use, the tap handle can radiate light until the 

tap is opened and tap handle transparent part 
no longer faces the light box window. 
The combination of claim 3 and claim 4 
and 
further characterised in that
 the tap handle 
root (16) terminates in a planar face (20) and
