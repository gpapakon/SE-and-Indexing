<ABSTRACT>
A parts feeding apparatus includes a plurality of 
cassettes (12) respectively holding therein rows of parts of 

different types and removably attached to a plurality of 
parts supply openings arranged at predetermined angular 

intervals along the peripheral edge of a rotating circular 
plate (11). The circular plate (11) is intermittently 

rotatable so that a selected one of the parts supply openings 
and the cassette (12) attached thereto are positioned 

relative to the inlet opening of a parts delivery chute 
(30a). An open lower end of the cassette (12) is opened and 

closed at predetermined time intervals by a reciprocating 
slide plate member disposed in a parts supply unit (17). The 

parts feeding apparatus thus constructed is compact in size 
and simple in construction. Since the cassettes (12) are 

arranged on the same circumference on the circular plate 
(11), the parts to be fed can be automatically and smoothly 

changed or switched from one type to another. Thus, the 
apparatus is readily adaptable to the production of articles 

of different types to be manufactured in relatively small 
lots or in relatively large lots.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a parts 
feeding apparatus used in connection with application of 
parts varying in type depending on the type of products to 
which the parts are to be applied, and capable of automatically 
changing or switching the parts from one type to 
another according to a production control procedure or 
system. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a parts feeding apparatus particularly suitable for used in 
the production of a wide variety of articles produced in 
relatively small lots. There have been proposed various parts feeding 
apparatus suitable for use in the production of various 
articles produced in small lots. One such apparatus disclosed, 
for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 
No. 3-57402 is designed to feed sliders for slide 
fasteners. The disclosed apparatus comprises a slider 
inventory unit including a plurality of guide rails arranged 
in parallel to one another, each releasably holding thereon 
rows of sliders of a different type, a slider conveying  
 
unit for capturing and conveying sliders one at a time 
from a selected one of the guide rails, and a slider guide 
unit for receiving the sliders conveyed one at a time from 
the slider conveying unit. The sliders received in the slider 
guide unit are conveyed one by one to a slider applying 
machine. Another parts feeding apparatus disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No. 
3-41710 includes a plurality of parts feed chutes arranged 
horizontally in parallel to one another. The chutes have 
respective downstream ends pivotally movable, as a single 
unit, in the same plane so that they come to communicate 
with a parts supplying holder to feed parts of different 
types selectively to the parts supplying holder. In the parts feeding apparatus disclosed in the 
aforesaid Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 3-57402, 
a plurality of rows of sliders of different types are 
stocked in parallel to one another, with all the sliders 
in each row being of the same type. Accordingly, as the 
number of the type of sliders to be fed increases, the 
necessary space for installation of the rails increases. 
In addition, from the inventory unit to the guide unit, 
the sliders are conveyed one by one by a mechanical means. 
It is difficult to speed up the conveying speed by using 
such a mechanical conveying means, which further require  
 
a mechanism extremely complicated in construction. On the other hand, in the case of the parts feeding

<CLAIMS>
A parts feeding apparatus for selectively 
feeding parts (BS) of different types to a subsequent processing 

station, comprising: 

(a) a parts inventory unit (10) including a rotating 
circular plate (11) having a plurality of parts supply 

openings (11a) arranged on the same circumference, and a 
plurality of parts stocking cassettes (12) storing respectively 

therein rows of parts (BS) of different types and 
removably attached to corresponding ones of said parts 

supply openings (11a) in such a manner that the parts (BS) 
in each of said parts stocking cassettes (12) can be discharged 

from the cassette (12) successively one at a time, 
said circular plate (11) being intermittently rotatable in a 

horizontal plane to selectively index said parts supply 
openings (11a); and 
(b) a chute unit (30) including a parts delivery 
chute (30a) mounted fixedly and having an inlet opening 

(30b) facing a portion of said circumference so that said 
parts supply openings (11a) in said rotating circular plate 

(11) can selectively come to communicate with said inlet 
opening (30b) of said parts delivery chute (30a) in response 

to intermittent rotation of said rotating circular plate (11). 
A parts feeding apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein said parts inventory unit (10) further includes a 

 
parts feeder (23) having a discharge guide member (23a), and 

a second cassette (12') for use with said parts feeder (23), 
said second cassette (12') being fitted in at least one of 

said parts supply openings (11a) and connectable with said 
discharge guide member (23a) of said parts feeder (23). 
A parts feeding apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein said parts inventory unit (10) further includes a 

slide member (16a) slidably disposed over each of said parts 
supply openings (11a) and normally urged in a first direction 

to close the corresponding parts supply opening (11a), 
said slide member (16a) having a parts discharge opening 

(16d) normally held out of alignment with said parts supply 
opening (11a), said parts discharge opening (16d) in said 

slide member (16a) being aligned with and hence communicating 
with said parts supply opening (11a) when said slide 

member (16a) is displaced in a second direction opposite to 
said first direction. 
A parts feeding apparatus according to claim 3, 
wherein said parts inventory unit (10) further includes a 

cylinder actuator (18) fixedly mounted for reciprocating 
said slide member (16a) in said first and second directions, 

said cylinder actuator (18) having a piston rod (18b) and an 
engagement portion (18a) provided on an outer end of said 

piston rod (18b), and wherein said slide member (16a) has an 
arcuate engagement groove (16b) extending concentrically 

 
with an axis of rotation of said rotating circular plate
