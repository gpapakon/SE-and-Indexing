<DESCRIPTION>
 /ΗTLE ALLOYS OF MOLYBDENUM, RHENIUM AND TUNGSTENFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to molybdenum alloys which possess improved tensile strength and a higher recrystallization temperature while maintaining an adequate level of ductility and corrosion resistance.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMolybdenum metal is used for various specialty applications which require its unusual properties. The melting point of molybdenum is 2630° C, over 1000° C higher than iron, permitting its use in furnace parts, rocket nozzles and other high-temperature applications where most metals would melt or fail. Molybdenum has exceptionally good resistance to corrosion by mineral acids under non-oxidizing conditions.However, because of its high melting point and poor ductility, molybdenum requires special manufacturing techniques.A molybdenum part having acceptable mechanical properties typically depends on working the metal below its recrystallization temperature. When recrystallization is allowed to occur, the molybdenum has a tendency toward brittleness at lower temperatures (e.g., near room temperature and below). Recrystallization becomes particularly difficult to avoid if the manufacturing process requires brazing or welding, since recrystallization may easily occur at the brazing or welding site. Should recrystallization occur, the weld must subsequently be warm-worked to improve ductility. Tin's tendency of recrystallized molybdenum to be brittle is one of the major deterrents to its use in many applications.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to an alloy comprising molybdenum, rhenium and tungsten which possess improved erosion resistance, tensile strength and a higher recrystallization temperature, while maintaining an adequate level of ductility and corrosion resistance. 

 The invention relates broadly to improving the properties of a molybdenum alloy comprising from about 10 wt. % through about 41 wt. % rhenium. In a specific aspect of the invention the alloy comprises about 77% molybdenum, 13% rhenium, and 10% tungsten by weight, and about 50 to 100 ppm of carbon. When converted into atomic %, this alloy corresponds to about 86.6% molybdenum, 7.5 % rhenium and 5.9% tungsten. This alloy possesses an approximately 10% higher tensile strength and an 80° C higher recrystall ation temperature than a Mo-13 wt.% Re alloy.The alloys of the invention may be prepared by powder metallurgy, followed by sintering and densification. Densification may be achieved by at least one of the following techniques:
