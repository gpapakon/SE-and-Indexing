<ABSTRACT>
A system and method are provided for dispersing storage of a 
plurality of related and unrelated data items on a plurality of removable 

recordable media instances (RMIs). A first storage device is provided 
for storing a data item on a related RMI (that is, an RMI having one or 

more related data items stored on it) if a related RMI is available which 
has sufficient actual storage space remaining for storing the data. A 

multiplier device is connected to the first storage device means for 
multiplying the actual size of a data item, which is not stored by the 

first storage device on the related RMI, by a factor greater than one, to 

produce reserved storage space data which characterizes any other RMI 
that actually stores the data item. A second storage device, which is 

responsive to the multiplier device is provided for storing a data item 
on an unrelated RMI (that is, an RMI having one or more unrelated data 

items stored on it) having sufficient actual and unreserved storage space 
remaining to store the data item. If there is no such unrelated RMI, 

then the second storage device stores the data item on a new RMI (an RMI 
having no data stored on it). 
This arrangement provides for shared logical space reservation so 
that physical proximity of related data items is optimized with respect 

to a set of RMIs. Even when an RMI is made ineligible to receive 
unrelated data items, provision is made for the RMI to receive related 

data items. The storage space made available for this purpose may be 
greater than the storage space reserved for one or more collections of 

data items on the RMI.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a system for storing 
related and unrelated data items on a plurality of removable recordable 
media instances (RMIs), and more particularly to a system which is 
adapted to reserve RMI storage space so that related data items can be 
grouped together even if they are stored at different times. The grouping of information by subject matter is basic to any 
library. For instance, in a library for books, the librarian typically 
reserves shelf space for a subject book, particularly when the subject 
matter is an active one. While this is relatively easy for a book 
library, it is much more difficult to arrange subject matter on 
electronic media in electronic storage devices. With electronic media, 
one deals with data items instead of books. A data item can be a word, a 
sentence, a normal book, larger than a normal book, or any size of 
drawing. When a number of electronic media producers or processors, such 
as personal computer workstations, store data items, it is more efficient 
to store these data items at a central location rather than on individual 
memories of the personal computers. For example, if a large number of 
people were working at various personal computer workstations to develop 
and process data items which are required for a large project, such as 
building a missile, it would be desirable that each one of these data 
items be classified by subject matter and stored at a remote location for 
retrieval by any one of the workstation users. In order to make the 
retrieval of this information efficient, it is necessary that related 
subject matter be grouped into a common location within the remote 
storage device so that the accessing device does not have to access 
related data items from one end of the storage device to the other. A prior art data file storage management system, available from the 
assignee of this application, eliminates the need for individual 
workstation users or groups of users to perform data storage space 
management on their limited storage devices. The system is a distributed  
 
file storage management system and is sold under the trademark "DFSMS", 
which is owned by the IBM Corporation. With this system, space 
management is handled by a storage administrator who can cause data 
storage space requests from distributed workstation sites to be allocated 
based upon particular parameters dictated by the enterprise being served. 
The DFSMS system is primarily focused on permanently mounted storage

<CLAIMS>
A data storage system for storing related and unrelated data items 
on a plurality of removable recordable media instances (RMIs) comprising: 

   reserving means for reserving storage space on an RMI; and 
   storing means, coupled to the reserving means, which storing means 

is adapted for storing a first data item either: 

(i) on a related RMI if a related RMI having sufficient storage space for 
storing said first data item is available (a related RMI being an RMI 

having one or more data items related to said first data item stored 
thereon); or 
(ii) on an unrelated RMI if no such related RMI is available but an 
unrelated RMI is available which has sufficient unreserved storage space 

for storing said first data item together with reserved storage space (an 
unrelated RMI being an RMI having one or more data items unrelated to 

said first data item stored thereon); or 
(iii) on a new RMI if no such related or unrelated RMIs are available (a 
new RMI being an RMI having no data items previously stored thereon); 
 
   wherein the reserving means is adapted for reserving storage space 

on an RMI whenever a data item is stored thereon for which that RMI is 
either an unrelated RMI or a new RMI. 
A system according to claim 1 wherein the reserving means includes 
means for multiplying the actual size of the data item by a factor 

greater than one to provide the reserved storage space when data 
corresponding to the multiplied-size data item is stored. 
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2 which is adapted to store 
a data item on the unrelated RMI which has the smallest number of 

unrelated collections of data items stored on it, in preference to other 
unrelated RMIs, if there is more than one unrelated RMI having sufficient 

unreserved storage space for storing the data item. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the 
reserving means and the storing means are within a programmed digital 

device. 
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, including: 
   a plurality of RMIs stored in respective locations in a library 

(22);
 

   a writing device (20) responsive to the storing means for writing 
data items to the RMIs; and 

   transport means (26) responsive to the storing means for 
transporting selected RMIs between the library and the writing device. 
A system according to claim 5 including: 
   a plurality of workstations (24a, 24b, 24c) for generating data 

items D and for generating data fields which identify each data item D by 
subject matter (s) and actual size (a) required to store the data item D 

on a RMI, each workstation being connected to the reserving means and the 
storing means; 

   a read device (32) connected to the workstations for reading data 
items D on the RMIs; and 

   said transport device also being responsive to the workstations for 
transporting selected RMIs between the library and the RMI reading 

device. 
A method for storing related and unrelated data items on a 
plurality of removable recordable media instances (RMIs) comprising the 

steps of: 
   storing a first data item on a related RMI if a related RMI having 

sufficient storage space for storing said first data item is available (a 
related RMI being an RMI having one or more data items related to said 

first data item stored thereon); or, 
   if no such related RMI is available, then storing said first data 

item on an unrelated RMI if an unrelated RMI is available having 
sufficient unreserved storage space for storing said first data item 

together with reserved storage space (an unrelated RMI being an RMI 
having one or more data items unrelated to said first data item stored 

thereon); or, 
   if no such related or unrelated RMIs are available, then storing 

said first data item on a new RMI (a new RMI being an RMI having no data 
items previously stored thereon); and 

   reserving storage space on an RMI whenever a data item is stored 
thereon for which that RMI is either an unrelated RMI or a new RMI. 
A method according to claim 7 including the step of: 
   multiplying the actual size of the data item by a factor greater 

than one to provide the reserved storage space when data corresponding to 
the multiplied-size data item is stored. 
A method according to claim 7 or claim 8, wherein the step of 
storing a data item on an unrelated RMI comprises storing the data item 

on the unrelated RMI which has the least number of unrelated collections 
of data items stored on it, if there is more than one unrelated RMI 

having sufficient unreserved storage space for storing the data item.
