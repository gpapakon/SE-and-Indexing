<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for generating crystal nuclei in melts comprises an upright (vertically oriented), closed vessel (2) having a vessel bottom (3) and at least one inlet (5) for the melt and at least one outlet port (7) for the seeded melt provided with crystal nuclei. A preferably annular zone (16) of the vessel wall is designed as a cooling surface. In the interior of the vessel a scraping element (9) is arranged which comprises a rotating shaft (10) which can be driven by a motor and extends axially through the vessel (2) almost as far as the vessel bottom (3). At the end facing the vessel bottom, the shaft (10) is equipped with at least one scraper arm (11) which extends, starting from the end of the shaft near the vessel bottom, firstly in the direction of the vessel wall and there runs essentially parallel to the annular cooling surface (16) and axially parallel to the drive shaft (10). On the scraper arm (11), preferably one or more scraping knives (12) are arranged which during operation sweep along the inner wall of the vessel (2) in the region of the cooling surface (16). The scraper element (9) can be heated. Granular materials having preferably high molecular weights, for example 
>
 300, are produced in a crystallisation plant which comprises a stock vessel for the melt, an apparatus of the abovementioned type for generating crystal nuclei in the melt and a prill tower in which the seeded melt provided with crystal nuclei is sprayed or discharged as droplets into a cooled gas stream. The droplets crystallise as they descend in free fall. The granular material (pellets) thus produced is discharged at the bottom of the tower.
