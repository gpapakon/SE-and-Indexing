<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a process 
as well as the use of an 
oxy-fuel burner for the combustion of and/or slag production from dust in the 
melting zone of a cupola. From the German disclosure DE-OS 41 09 214, one process for the 
operation of a cupola is well-known. By this process the-dust filtered out 
from the cupola stack gas (combustion gas) is supplied to the furnace 
either through the furnace air or through its own individual supply system 
with separate transport gas into the same area as the air supply. In this 
manner, the dust is used as slag forming material. By supplying cold filter dust using a cold transport medium, the 
temperature of the furnace is reduced in the vicinity of the place where 
the dust and its transport medium are introduced: i.e., by the process 
described in the above-named disclosure. This adversely affects the 
furnace operation. In the June 1966 edition of the journal "Modern Castings", the use of 
oxy-fuel burners with separate oxygen supplies which are installed in the 
tuyeres of a cupola is described. The oxy-fuel burners serve as an 
additional control for increasing temperature in the cupola melting zone 
and can cause a noticeable increase in the furnace melting rates. A 
disadvantage of using oxy-fuel burners in the process described in this 
article, is that full utilization of the oxy-fuel burner capabilities is 
not fully explored. Oxy-fuel burners certainly improve some cupola 
operating parameters, but it is not possible without furnace modification 
to supply necessary material to control slag formation and simultaneously 
to dispose of the dust which results from combustion. The heat of the oxy-fuel 
burner used in the process described in the article makes it 
impossible to utilize dust supply without adversely affecting furnace 
temperature. Also it is not possible, with the oxy-fuel burner discussed  
 
in the article, to eliminate further carburization of the furnace entrance 
zone through the use of coke dust as fuel. From WO 88/05149 a process for the disposal of dust by slag production in a cupola 
is known. The dust is introduced into the melting zone via a hot-air supply and an 
injection-tuyere. It is, however, not proposed in this document to feed the dust to the 
flame of an oxy-fuel-burner. LU-A-0 087 961 describes the injection of coal-powder 
via injectors and oxygen into a combustion flame of a burner in order to create a 
reducing atmosphere. The problem of the disposal of dust remains unsolved by the 
disclosure of this document. In
