<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a thermal ink jet printer 
including a printhead having ink firing heater resistors 

responsive to pulses provided to the printhead. A sequence 
of pulse bursts of respective increasing or decreasing 

pulse energies that span a predetermined pulse energy range 
is applied to the printhead, each pulse burst comprised of 

a plurality of pulses having a pulse energy that is 
associated with such pulse burst and is constant for all 

pulses in such burst, and each burst having a sufficient 
number of pulses to allow the printhead to achieve a steady 

state operating temperature at the pulse energy of the 
pulse burst. A steady state operating temperature sample 

is determined for each of the sequence of pulses bursts of 
different pulse energies to produce a set of temperature 

samples respectively associated with the increasing pulse 
energies, and a turn on pulse energy is determined from the 

temperature samples. The thermal ink jet printhead is then 
operated with a pulse energy that is greater than the turn 

on pulse energy and in a range that provides a desired 
print quality while avoiding premature failure of the 

heater resistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates generally to thermal ink 
jet printers, and is directed more particularly to a 
technique for determining the turn on energy of a thermal 
ink jet printhead while the printhead is installed in a 
printer. An ink jet printer forms a printed image by printing 
a pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an 
array defined for the printing medium. The locations are 
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear 
array. The locations are sometimes called "dot 
locations", "dot positions", or "pixels". Thus, the 
printing operation can be viewed as the filling of a 
pattern of dot locations with dots of ink. Ink jet printers print dots by ejecting very small 
drops of ink onto the print medium, and typically include 
a movable carriage that supports one or more printheads 
each having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses 
over the surface of the print medium, and the nozzles are 
controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times 
pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller, 
wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is 
intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the 
image being printed.  
 The printheads of thermal ink jet printers are 
commonly implemented as replaceable printhead cartridges 
which typically include one or more ink reservoirs and an 
integrated circuit printhead that includes a nozzle plate 
having an array of ink ejecting nozzles, a plurality of ink 
firing chambers adjacent respective nozzles, and a 
plurality of heater resistors adjacent the firing chambers 
opposite the ink ejecting nozzles and spaced therefrom by 
the firing chambers. Each heater resistor causes an ink 
drop to be fired from its associated nozzle in response to 
an electrical pulse of sufficient energy. A thermal ink jet printhead requires a certain minimum 
energy to fire ink drops of the proper volume (herein 
called the turn on energy). Turn on energy can be 
different for different printhead designs, and in fact 
varies among different samples of a given printhead design 
as a result of manufacturing tolerances. As a result, 
thermal ink jet printers are configured to provide a fixed 
ink firing energy that is greater than the expected lowest 
turn on energy for the printhead cartridges it can 
accommodate. A consideration with utilizing a fixed ink firing 
energy is that firing energies excessively greater than the 
actual turn on energy of a particular printhead cartridge 
result in a shorter operating
