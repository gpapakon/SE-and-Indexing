excellent mounting ability is achieved and damage and
dislodging of a recording apparatus can be prevented.

A mounting opening for mounting the recording apparatus
is formed in a side surface of an apparatus body

comprised of an ASF upper case and an ASF base. When
the recording apparatus is mounted, after the recording

apparatus is rested on a recording apparatus supporting
portions for supporting the recording apparatus for

shifting movement in a mounting direction, the

recording apparatus is guided along the recording
apparatus supporting portions in the mounting

direction. By providing an eaves portion substantially
in parallel with the recording apparatus supporting

portions, an upward movement of the recording apparatus
is regulated when and after the recording apparatus is

mounted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet feeding apparatus for feeding a recording medium to a recording apparatus and an image forming apparatus having such a sheet feeding apparatus, and more particularly, it relates to mounting of the recording apparatus.Similar to many other equipments, compactness and light-weighted requirements for a recording apparatus (referred to as "printer" hereinafter) have been sought greatly, and, thus, printers have been made compact and light-weighted.During realization of compactness, as disclosed in document JP-A-6-183582, there has been proposed a technique in which a printer body portion for recording an image is separated from an auto sheet feeder (referred to as "ASF" hereinafter) portion (sheet feeding apparatus) for stacking sheets thereon and feeding the stacked sheets (recording media) one by one to an image forming portion of the printer, so that the ASF can be detachably mounted to the printer.Further, there has also been proposed an ASF which can detachably be mounted, from outside, to a printer having a plurality of sheet feeding openings or a printer in which only manual sheet insertion is permitted, as well as the compact printer.In such a conventional ASF, the ASF essentially has a concept that it is to be mounted to the printer, and, thus, the printer is a principal part on the desk exceedingly. That is to say, since the conventional ASF cannot perform a function for automatically feeding the sheet by itself only, the ASF can have any form. For example, the only ASF may not be operated by itself or may not be operated in a condition that recording media (referred to as "sheets" hereinafter) are set therein.However, recently, a mobile field has been noticed to enhance maneuverability, and, thus, portable ability has been requested for printers. To this end, for the ASFs, there has been requested a function for connection to the portable printer on the desk in a more preferable condition, i.e., a function in which a so-called mobile printer having excellent portable ability can be used as a desk-top printer having excellent sheet feeding ability on the desk.Further, in an ASF to be mounted to the printer from outside, for example, as disclosed in document JP-A-4-303336, a drive transmitting means (such as a gear) exposed out of the ASF is connected to a drive transmitting means exposed out of the printer so that a motor disposed within the printer can be used as a drive source for a sheet feed roller for feeding the sheets one by one.Further, in the ASF
