<ABSTRACT>
Lever, particularly usable for sports shoes including a 
lever arm (2) which is articulated to a pivot (4) that can 

be arranged between two teeth (5) of a rack (6) that in turn 
is associable with the other flap to be closed. The lever 

arm has a protrusion (10) for engagement with 
complementarily shaped seats (12) formed laterally with 

respect to the rack. The protrusion (10) and the seats (12) 
allow to retain the pivot (4) between two teeth (5) of the 

rack (6) so as to allow to maintain the closed condition 
even when no traction is applied to the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lever particularly 
usable for sports shoes such as ski boots, ice skates, or 
roller skates. In the manufacture of this kind of shoes it is 
necessary to mutually close flaps, such as for example the 
flaps of the shell or of the quarter, in order to close the 
shoe. It is known to use, for this purpose, levers that are 
for example constituted by a lever arm which is pivoted at 
one end to two shoulders. The shoulders are rigidly coupled 
to a first flap to be closed and the lever arm has a rack, 
towards the surface of the shoe. A ring selectively 
interacts with the rack, and at its other end the ring is 
rigidly coupled to the second flap to be closed. Other known levers have a U-shaped lever arm. A bar is 
associated between the wings of said arm and is associated 
by means of a coupling element with a cable or band or ring 
that interact, at their other end, with a rack that is 
associated with the second flap to be closed. All these conventional levers have a drawback: as more 
than one lever is usually arranged on the shoe, once one 
lever has been closed, the closure of the adjacent lever 
reduces the load applied to the previous one, which 
therefore tends to disengage from the rack. The different 
tension between two contiguous levers in fact produces a 
traction force on the more tightly closed lever and an 
oppositely orientated force on the contiguous lever which 
tends to push the lever out. Accordingly, even a small impact is sufficient to open  
 
the lever arm. Italian patent no. 755,249 is known as a partial 
solution to this drawback and discloses a lever-like closure 
device for ski boots and sports shoes in general which is 
essentially constituted by a base plate which is essentially 
T-shaped and is rigidly coupled, at its corners, by a flap 
to be joined. Two parallel sides, provided with recesses 
which are open upward, protrude from its stem. A closure lever is also articulated to the base plate 
approximately at the connection between the stem and the 
head. The lever has, in the direction of the flap to be 
closed, notches at which it is possible to place a ring 
which is rigidly coupled, at its other end, to the other 
flap to be closed. In this solution, once the lever has been closed, the 
recesses coincide with the notches so as to clamp the ring 
between them. However, even this solution has drawbacks: first of all 
it is constituted by two separate components which must be 
mutually assembled. Furthermore, this assembly must be

<CLAIMS>
Lever particularly for sports shoes, comprising a 
lever arm (2) articulated to a closure member (3) and having 

a pivot (4) arranged between two teeth (5) of a rack (6) 
that is associable with another closure member to be closed, 

characterized in that said lever arm has means (10) for 
engagement with complementarily shaped seats (12) formed 

laterally with respect to said rack (6) to retain said pivot 
(4) between said two teeth (5). 
Lever according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said lever arm (2) is U-shaped and has two arms (11a,11b), 

said engagement means being constituted by at least one 
protrusion (10) that protrudes inside the inner lateral 

surface of at least one of the arms (11a,11b) that form said 
lever arm. 
Lever according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said at least one protrusion (10) is curved. 
Lever according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said at least one protrusion (10) is located between said 

pivot (4) and the free end of said lever arm (2). 
Lever according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said at least one protrusion (10) can be selectively and 

removably arranged at one of said complementarily shaped 
seats (12) formed on a set of teeth (13) that protrudes 

laterally with respect to said rack (6). 
Lever according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said at least one protrusion (10) is located at such a 

distance from said pivot (4) as to allow to place it within 
one of said seats (12) after a rotation imparted to said 

 
lever arm (2) while said pivot (4) is located between two 

adjacent teeth of said rack (6). 
Lever according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said at least one protrusion 

(10) is at least as thick as said set of teeth (13) that 
protrudes laterally with respect to said rack (6). 
Lever according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said at least one protrusion (10) is shaped like a circular 

arc centered on the axis of said pivot (4). 
Lever according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that when the lever arm (2) is 

closed on said rack (6) said at least one protrusion (10) 
prevents said lever arm from making any movement other than 

a rotation so as to open. 
Lever according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said at least one protrusion (10) and said seats (12) have 

such dimensions as to allow the disengagement of said lever 
arm (2) from said rack (6) beyond a given rotation angle 

imparted to said lever arm (2). 
Lever according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said pivot (4) is accommodated 

within a seat (7) of said rack (6) that is connected to said 
two teeth (5) by means of a first vertical wall (8) and a 

second vertical wall (9).
