<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a fastener of the bayonet type for fastening a cylindrical casing (housing) onto a support plate or wall. According to the invention, the casing (1) includes, integrally with it, peripheral lugs (4 and 4a) interacting with cutouts (8 and 8a) in the wall (3), indexing means (6 and 9) providing for the angular position for insertion of the lugs into the cutouts in the wall and for their angular locking position, and means (6) for the angular locking of the elastic means (10 or 10a) being provided in order to take up the axial play between the casing and the plate.

<CLAIMS>
A bayonet-type device for fastening a cylindrical housing to a support plate or 
wall, comprising, integral with the housing (1), peripheral lugs (4 and 4
a
) 
cooperating with cut-outs (8 and 8
a
) in the wall (3), indexing and angular 
locking means (6) cooperating with notches (9 and 9
a
) provided in the wall to 
ensure the angular position for introducing the lugs into the cut-outs in the wall 

and their angular locking position, the device further comprising elastic means 
for taking up play interposed between an outer flange (7) of the housing and 

the plate,
 
characterised in that the indexing and angular locking means are constituted 

by an axial lug (6) that can pass through a first notch (9) of the wall (2) when 
the housing is put into position and can be engaged in a second notch (9
a
) in 
the wall when the housing is in the locked position. 
A fastening device according to Claim 1, characterised in that each of the 
peripheral lugs (4 and 4
a
) is extended by a heel (5 or 5
a
), the shape and 
dimensions of the cut-outs (8 and 8
a
) in the wall (2) corresponding to those of 
the lugs together with their heels. 
A fastening device according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the 
angular offset
 of the notches (9 and 9
a
) is equal to the angle a corresponding 
to the sector formed by the lugs (4 and 4
a
) to the outside of their heels (5 and 
5
a
). 
A fastening device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
elastic means for taking up play are constituted by an elastomer ring (10) 

arranged between the wall (3) and said external flange (7) of the housing. 
A fastening device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
elastic means for taking up play are constituted by a fork, the branches (12
a
 
and 12
b
) of which are elastic and are undulating in shape.
