<ABSTRACT>
The pad printing machine has a carriage (45) which can be moved back and forth on a base plate (1) by means of a drive (25). The carriage (45) has a U-shaped support (8) which is constructed in a box shape and is made of sheet metal. Mounted on the two limbs (9, 10) of the support (8) protruding out of the machine housing (2) are a printing device (37) and an inking device (18) which can be moved with the carriage (45). The support (8) made of sheet metal allows a very cost-effective and yet sturdy production of the pad printing machine.

<CLAIMS>
A pad printing machine, comprising an inking 
device (18, 55) and a slide member (45, 52) which is 

adapted to reciprocate in a machine housing (2) and on 
which there is disposed a printing device (34) with a 

printing cushion (39) and which is movable by means of 
a drive (25) horizontally between a first and second 

position for ink take-up and delivery, characterised in 
that the slide member (45, 52) is fixed by its guide 

(6) on a baseplate (1) of the machine housing and has a 
support (8, 53, 54) in the form of a box which extends 

upwards from the baseplate (1) and the printing device 
(34) is mounted on said support.
