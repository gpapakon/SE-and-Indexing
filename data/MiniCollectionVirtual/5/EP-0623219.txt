<ABSTRACT>
A device for wireless transfer of information, comprising a data carrier in the form of a transponder that is configured as a thin card that can receive a first microwave signal, modulate it and code it with data to obtain a second microwave signal that is reflected and reradiated without adding new energy. Reception and reradiation takes place via a microstrip patch antenna in the card, where the ground plane's (29) surface is of principally equal size as the antenna layer (28), thereby forming an antenna diagram (26) that makes it possible to communicate the card from either side. The invention also relates to a card holder comprising a reflective material (21) with a surface size that is larger than the ground plane/antenna surface of the card, thereby giving the aforementioned card an increased directivity to obtain a long communication range (28) and to make it insensitive to uncontrolled back lobe signal reflections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for wireless transfer
of information, and comprises a data carrier in the form of a
transponder that is configured as a thin card. It can receive a
first microwave signal, modulate it and code it with data to
obtain a second microwave signal that is reflected and
reradiated without adding new energy. Reception and reradiation
takes place via a micro strip patch antenna in the card, where
the ground plane's surface is of principally equal size as the
antenna surface, thereby forming an antenna diagram that makes
it possible to communicate the card from either side.The invention also relates to a card holder comprising a
reflective material with a surface size that is larger than the
ground plane/antenna surface of the card, thereby giving the
aforementioned card an increased directivity to obtain a long
communication range and to make it insensitive to uncontrolled
back lobe signal reflections.The invention is in particular intended to be carried by a
person to obtain automatic identification and data
communication, but can also be used in other ways. One such
application is when the card holder is attached to the inside
of a vehicle's window to use the card also for automatic
debiting of road tolls, parking fees et cetera. The device can
also be used for debiting in relation to automatic fuelling of
vehicles.As is generally known, microwave technology provides a
potential for comparatively long wireless communication range
as compared to other technologies like magnetic cards, bar
coded cards, inductive cards and medium wave cards. A number of microwave transponders are known that have a
directed lobe diagram, i e with a sensitivity that is high on
one side while the other side has a low sensitivity. To
communicate these transponders, it is thus necessary to orient
them with the sensitive side towards their read- or read/write
equipment, hereafter called interrogator, to obtain a secure
and long range communication.Especially concerning personal identification and data
communication, it would be convenient if it wasn't necessary to
orient the card with a special side towards the interrogator's
antenna. This is especially true in cases when the card is hand
carried such as at a time recording terminal, a teller machine
or paying automate. Ultimately, no special education of the
user would be necessary if the only orientation requirement for
secure communication is that the transponder is held close to
the interrogator's antenna.At the same time, it would be

A device for wireless transfer of information, comprising a data carrier in the form of a
thin card transponder, that receives a first microwave signal, modulates it and codes it

with data, and reradiates a second microwave signal without adding new energy thereto,
including at least one antenna device formed using microstrip conductors, the antenna

device comprising a patch antenna with an antenna layer (15, 28, 37) that acts against a
ground plane (16, 29, 38) where the antenna layer and the ground plane are of substantially

equal size, characterized in that, the device is equipped (20) with a reflective
surface that is larger than said ground plane, said reflective surface increasing the range

by reradiating the second microwave signal and reducing sensitivity to back lobe
reflections and being formed either as a reflecting surface (21) in a separate card holder

(20) or as a metallic foil (56) fitted on the ground plane (38) side of the card.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, a magnetic strip (54) is arranged

along the card and that the card is made in ISO thickness along this magnetic strip, i.e.
typically 0.76 mm and maximum 0.84 mm, but that the card has a higher thickness

elsewhere to make room for internal parts of the card.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, the card holder is designed to be
attached to the inside of a vehicle's window and/or that the card is insertable to and

removable from the slot that is formed between the holder's reflective surface and the
window.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, the card repeatedly modulates the
second microwave signal with a code from it's memory, where every code is time

limited with random or pseudo random time intervals.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, a common modulation/detection
diode (7) is used for detection and for modulation.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, a modulation/detection diode (44) is
integrated onto the same substrate as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC),

(45), to form one single component that is used both for microwave and for low
frequency functions.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, said card holder is in a shape of a
rectangular compartment, and said thin card transponder is disposed within said card

holder.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, said microstrip conductors are
located within an inner circumference of an antenna surface of said antenna device, and

ground plane.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, said reflective surface is wider than
the surface of said antenna device and said ground plane along the polarization E-plane.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, said microstrip conductors are
circularly polarized permitting said thin card to be oriented according to an arbitrary

rotational angle of said thin card.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, said patch antenna and said reflective
surface reflects components of the second microwave signal in phase increasing the

distance the second microwave signal is propagated from said antenna device.
