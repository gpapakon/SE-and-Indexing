<ABSTRACT>
An (electric) arc quenching device for an electrical switch, especially for an automatic cut-out (circuit-breaker) and contactor consists of one movable and one fixed contact piece (11, 12) which are arranged in a quenching chamber space (22). During a switching operation, an arc is produced at the contact location, the base points of which arc commutate from the contact pieces (11, 12) to arc conduction rails (13, 14, 16; 18) which feed the arc to a quenching device (15). In order to accelerate the movement of the arc, a locking plate (21) is provided in front of the contact location (11, 12), seen in the arc running direction (P), which locking plate frontally seals the quenching chamber space (22) in the region in front of the contact location (11, 12), so that gas flow in this region in front of the contact location (11, 12) is prevented.

Arc quenching arrangement for an electric switch, 
in particular for a circuit-breaker or a contactor, 

having a moving contact stud (11), which is mounted on 
the end of a contact lever (10) which can pivot or can be 

displaced parallel to itself with respect to the contact 
point opening, is located in an extinction chamber space, 

and at which there is produced during a switching operation 
an arc whose roots commutate from the contact studs 

(11, 12) to arc runner rails which feed the arc to a 
quenching device (15), preferably an arc splitter stack, 

the contact lever (10) forming a segment of the arc 
runner rails, 
characterized in that
, seen in the arc 
running direction (P), a blocking plate (21) is provided 

in front of the contact point (11, 12) and in front of 
the contact lever (10) in front of the end thereof near 

the contact stud, and seals the extinction chamber space 
(22), to the front in the region in front of the contact 

point (11, 12), that is to say against the arc running 
direction (P), with the result that a gas flow into the 

space in front of the contact point is prevented, and in 
that a contact lever section located between the moving 

contact stud (11) and the end remote from the contact 
stud serves as an arc runner rail. 
Arc quenching arrangement according to Claim 1, 
having a pivotable contact lever on which the moving 

contact stud is fastened, characterized in that the 
blocking plate (21) extends perpendicularly to the 

contact lever (10) when the latter is in the closed 
position.
