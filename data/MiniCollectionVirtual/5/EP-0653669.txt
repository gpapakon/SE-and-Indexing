<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation
of silver halide tabular grain emulsions rich in chloride having
(100) major parallel faces, and to photographic materials containing
an emulsion thus prepared.High aspect ratio tabular grains exhibit several pronounced
photographic advantages. Thanks to their particular morphology
greater amounts of spectral sensitizers can be adsorbed per mole
silver halide compared to classical globular grains. As a
consequence such spectrally sensitized tabular grains show an
improved speed-granularity relationship and a wide separation
between their blue speed and minus blue speed. Sharpness of
photographic images can be improved using tabular grains thanks to
their lower light scattering properties again compared to
conventional globular emulsion grains. In color negative materials
the conventional sequence of the light sensitive layers can be
altered and the yellow filter layer can be omitted. In developed
black-and-white images high covering power is obtained even at high
hardening levels; alternatively reduced silver halide coverages can
be achieved if wanted resulting again in improved sharpness. In
double coated radiographic materials the presence of tabular grains
reduces the so-called cross-over which is the dominant factor for
sharpness in such materials.The early patent disclosures on high aspect tabular grains, e.g.
US 4,434,226, US 4,439,520, US 4,425,425, US 4,425,426 and
US 4,433,048 are concerned with high sensitive silver bromide or
silver iodobromide emulsions. In these disclosures the obtained
tabular grains in their most common form have two (111) triangular
or hexagonal opposed major crystal faces. It requires special
measures in order to obtain tabular AgBr(I) grains showing parallel
(100) major faces. Bogg U.S. Patent 4,063,951 reported the first
tabular grain emulsions in which the tabular grains had parallel
(100) major crystal faces. The tabular grains of Bogg exhibited
square or rectangular major faces, thus lacking the three fold
symmetry of conventional tabular grain (111) major crystal faces. 
Bogg employed an ammoniacal ripening process for preparing the
tabular grains, thereby encountering disadvantages such as grain
thickening and high pH conditions. In US 4,386,156, an improved
process is disclosed by Mignot for the preparation of tabular silver
bromide grains bounded by parallel square or rectangular major
crystal faces, said process comprising (a) providing a monodisperse
silver bromide emulsion containing cubic seed
