<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an off side detection
system using teleindicators with enable the referees to

obtain a signal indicating that an off side play has
occurred. The system is comprised of a portable emitter

which is activated by the referee by mechanical pulsing
which will always be effected when the player who has the

ball passes the ball to another player. The system also
comprises a portable receiver which is carried by the

assistant; said receiver has a button and can be
activated by the assistant by pulsing it whenever a

player is in an off side position. The system is
characterised by providing a signal which is perceived by

a person in order to indicate to this person that the
ball has been passed by one player while another player

was off side. With such a system, all the assistant has
to do is to observe, once he has received the signal, if

the ball is going towards the player who has been
detected off side and to apply the off side rule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system of teleindicators
that is used to penalise rightly the offside play.This system uses a portable teleindicador which is
pressed manually and activates a receiver that other
person will carry. The receiver is characterized, because
it has a button of on/off, if you don't press the
receiver's button, it will be disconnected. The receiver
activates a signal which will be noticed by the person
who carries it.This system uses emitters and receivers that
actually have already been developed, although they are
used for other purposes.In this sport there is a football device which has a
concrete function and it is very different of mine. This
device, incorporates an emitter in the assistant's flag
and it is used when he wants to warn the referee about
something.Offside detection system resolves a complex problem
as it is the offside. The problem that has the referee
and the assistant is to penalise correctly a move, they
have to be able to watch two simultaneous actions, which
many times are made in a large distant between them,
doing difficult its observation.To understand better the problem, I will use the 
definition "offside rule" that says: It is not an offence
in itself to be in an offside position.A player is in an offside position if:
he is nearer to his opponents' goal line than both
the ball and the second last opponent.A player in an offside position is only penalised if,
at the moment the ball touches or is played by one of his
team, he is, in the opinion of the referee, involved in
active play by:
interfering with play orinterfering with an opponent orgaining an advantage by being in that position.The rule clearly says that and offside position must
be penalised if it carries out one of these conditions.
We can conduce saying that to the difficulty of
interpreting the rule, it is joined to see the actions of
the players that take part in the move.The purpose of this system, is not to say when the
referee must penalised the offside, instead of it will
make the perception of work easier and he will only have
to interpret the offside rule. In order to get it, the
system activates a signal which will advise that at same
time that the signal is produced, a pass has been done
while a player was in offside position. To get this
signal, what the system pretend is distributing the work
of perception of the move, so that one will control the 
action of touching or play of the ball, while the other
one controls the position of the nearer adversary to the
offside line that
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The offside detection system is characterised by
producing a perceptible signal for human being, which is

caused with the use of a portable emitter and a receiver.
The offside detection system is characterised by
using a portable emitter that emits a determinated

frequency and has a button that activates the emitter,
during this emission as long as the button keeps pulsed.
The offside detection system is characterised by
using a receiver that activates a perceptible signal for

human being, this signal is produced when the receiver
receives the emitter's signal.
The offside detection system is characterised by
using a receiver with a button that activates the

receiver. This will keep activated as long as the button
is pulsed. So the signal that caused the receiver only is

produced when both emitter and receiver keep pulsed at
the same time.
The offside detection system is characterised by its
way of doing, the referee shows with his emitter that a

ball touches has been done, pulsing the emitter, at the
same time the assistant activates the receiver when a

player is an offside position. This system is
characterised for getting a signal that shows that both

actions have been produced at the same time, that means,
a move in offside.
The offside detection system is characterised by
doing with two different frequency emitters. By this way

the signal will only produce if is receives the signal of
both emitters.
The offside detection system is characterised by
getting a signal that shows that two actions have been

produced at the same time, independently of getting this
signal.
Amended claims under Art. 19.1 PCT
1. A system for detecting the "offside" situation in
football, characterised in that a radio wave emitter and

a radio wave receiver are used to generate a signal that
warns the assistant referee or linesman that a ball pass

have been done while a player was placed in a "offside"
position.
2. A system for detecting the "offside" situation in
football as defined in claim 1, also characterised in

that the warning signal is generated by the receiver when
it is activated by the assistant referee or linesman and

it simultaneously receives a radio signal generated when
the emitter is activated by the referee.
3. A system for detecting the "offside" situation in
football as defined in claim 2, also characterised in

that the emitter includes an activation button which is
pressed by the referee when a ball pass is done.
4. A system for detecting the "offside" situation in
football as defined in claim 3 also characterised in that

the receiver is activated by the assistant referee or
linesman whenever he/she notices that a player is in a

"offside" position.
5. A system for detecting the "offside" situation in
football characterised in that two radio wave emitters of

different frequencies and a radio wave receiver are used,
the assistant referee being warned by the receiver when

it simultaneously receives the radio signals generated by
both the emitters, the warning indicating that a ball

pass has been done while a player was in a "offside"
position.
6. A system for detecting the "offside" situation in
football as defined in any one of the preceding claims,

also characterised in that their components are
incorporated in the equipment employed by the referee and

his/her assistants to carry out their task.
DECLARATION UNDER ARTICLE 19.1
The claims have been modified to clearly set an
innovative step between the claimed invention, as defined

in the new claims, and the prior art documents cited in
the International Search Report.
The previous claims could be a problem for the
invention because of they were redacted in a very generic

ways.
The scope of the new claims is clearly narrower than
was the original one. All the new claims are entirely

grounded on the original description and drawings.
