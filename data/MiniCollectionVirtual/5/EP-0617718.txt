<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to aqueous-based erasable ink markers.Aqueous-based erasable inks typically include a film-forming elastomeric
polymer and colorant dispersed in water. When the inks are applied to paper, the water
evaporates and the polymer provides a coalesced residue on the surface of the paper.
The inks are erasable in that the residue can be removed from the paper surface for
some period of time after formation without leaving a visible residue or damaging the
paper.According to the present invention there is provided a marker comprising
an outer body; a writing tip at one end of said body; a fiber reservoir included within
said body and connected to said writing tip; and within said reservoir an aqueous-based
ink that is erasable from 27.2 kg (60 lb.) offset printing paper, said
ink having a viscosity of between 10cps and 30cps and comprising water, a water-insoluble
colorant, and a latex emulsion, said latex emulsion having a brookfield viscosity measured at 25°C of less
than 50cps and including a styrene/butadiene copolymer having a styrene content
of not greater than 35%; wherein said tip is porous and said ink is delivered from said fiber
reservoir to said tip by capillary action. US-A-4940 628 discloses an aqueous-based erasable marking
composition containing water, a water-insoluble colorant, a styrene-butadiene
copolymer the composition having a viscosity of 1-70 cps.EP-A-O100 834 and JP-A-57 135878 disclose an aqueous-based erasable
marking composition containing water, a water-insoluble colorant, and a styrene-butadiene
copolymer.The erasable inks of the invention provide markings that
can be readily removed from paper for a lengthy period of time
(more than a year) after the ink is applied, without damaging 
the paper or leaving a visible residue. The inks
are storage-stable, easy to manufacture, and easy
to apply. The inks preferably have a low
viscosity and as a result are particularly
suitable for use with standard felt-tip markers
that rely on a capillary feed system to draw ink
from a reservoir. Thus, the inks are suitable for
use in markers, which typically use fluorescent-colored
pigments. One significant advantage to
using the inks in markers is that when textbook
pages are highlighted by a student, the
highlighted portions can be erased a year later
when the book is given or sold to a different
student.Other features and advantages of the
invention will be apparent from the Description of
the Preferred Embodiments thereof, and from the
claims.The preferred compositions
