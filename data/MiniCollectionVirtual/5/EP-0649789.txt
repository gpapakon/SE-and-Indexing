<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of and to an apparatus 
for draping tampons into wrapping material.

 
To this end, a web of wrapping material is converted into a 

continuous tube which is advanced in the direction of its 
longitudinal axis and is subdivided into tubular sections. 

Tampons are introduced into successive sections while the 
sections advance transversely of their length, and the open 

ends of the filled tubular sections are closed.
 

An advantage of the improved method and apparatus is that 
one can turn out large numbers of wrapped tampons per unit 

of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improvements in methods
of and in apparatus for producing discrete tubular
envelopes or wrappers of finite length, e.g., for storage
or commodities in the ford of rods, cylinders, bars or the
like. Typical examples of commodities which can be
confined in tubular envelopes or wrappers of the type
adapted to be produced in accordance with the present
invention are catamenial tampons. However, the envelopes
or wrappers (hereinafter called tubes for short) which can
be obtained in accordance with the method and by resorting
to the apparatus of the present invention can be employed
with equal or similar advantage for temporary or long-lasting
storage or confinement of many other types of
commodities in the form of grains, rods, bars (such as
candy bars), pellets, cylinders and/or others.It is known to confine various types of
commodities in tubular envelopes, normally in such a way
that the material of which the envelopes are made is draped
around the commodities to be confined therein. For
example, a continuous cigar, cigarillo or cigarette rod can
be obtained by forming a continuous rod-like filled or
natural, synthetic and/or reconstituted tobacco and by
draping the filler into a running web of cigarette paper or
other suitable wrapping material. The thus obtained.
continuous cigar, cigarillo or cigarette rod is thereupon
severed at regular intervals by a so-called cutoff to yield
a file or row of successive cigars, cigarillos or
cigarettes of unit length or multiple unit length. Filter
rod sections for attachment to plain cigarettes, cigars or
cigarillos can be produced in a similar way by draping a
web of wrapping material around a running rod-like filler
of filter material for tobacco smoke.The GB-A-2 097 356 discloses a method of and an apparatus for wrapping
rolls of paper. The paper rolls are draped into an endless strip of wrapping 
material which is perforated at future separating locations and is converted
into a tube. Upon partial severing, and as a result of the application of a
tensional stress by means of driven belts which engage the end of the tube,
the leading end of the tubular wrapping material and the rolls which are
confined therein are separated from the next-following part as a result of
tearing at a separating location.Entirely different problems arise if discrete commodities,
such as catamenial tampons or other feminine 
hygiene products, are to be individually confined in
prefabricated envelopes, e.g., in tubes consisting of or
containing paper, metallic
