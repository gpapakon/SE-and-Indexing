<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to normally tacky pressure-sensitive 
adhesive compositions, and, more 
particularly, tapes that utilize such compositions. Pressure-sensitive adhesive tape that is 
especially suited for sealing boxes must exhibit a 
relatively high value of shear strength. At the same 
time, it is preferred that the tape be relatively soft 
and be economically feasible. On the basis of 
economics, it would be desirable for the adhesive to be 
hot-melt coatable. U.S. Patent No. 3,954,692 discloses a mixture of 
(a) an unvulcanized elastomeric block copolymer having 
the general configuration A - B - A wherein each A is 
an independently selected nonelastomeric monovinyl 
aromatic hydrocarbon polymer block having an average 
molecular weight of 2,000 to 100,000, the total block A 
content being from 10 to 50% by weight of 
the copolymer, and B is an elastomeric conjugated diene 
polymer block having an average molecular weight from 
25,000 to 1,000,000, and (b) a compatible, 
thermoplastic tackifying resin containing carbon-to-carbon 
unsaturation therein and derived from 
hydrocarbons having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms and at 
least one carbon-to-carbon double bond therein selected 
from aliphatic hydrocarbons and alicyclic hydrocarbons. U.S. Patent No. 3,239,478 discloses an adhesive 
comprising a block copolymer having a general 
configuration A - B - A wherein each A is a  
 
thermoplastic polymer block and which is relatively 
incompatible with the elastomeric B segment; the 
average molecular weight of each A being between 
5,000 and 125,000; B is a polymer block of a conjugated 
diene, the average molecular eight of the blocks being 
between 15,000 and 250,000; the total of 
blocks A being less than about 80% by weight of the 
block copolymer; in addition to the block copolymer a 
tackifying resin and a particular extender oil, said 
oil being substantially incompatible with homopolymers 
of the aforesaid thermoplastic terminal blocks and 
being substantially compatible with homopolymers of the 
aforesaid conjugated diene. Compositions of the block 
copolymer described above with 5 to 200 phr (preferably 
25 to 125 phr) (parts per hundred of block copolymer) 
of extending oil and 25 to 300 phr (preferably 50 to 
200 phr) of a tackifying resin were disclosed. By 
adjustment of the proportions of the three basic 
ingredients and choice of molecular weight of 
copolymer, melting point and type of tackifying resin, 
compatibility of oil and resin with the copolymer, a 
hot-melt adhesive can be
