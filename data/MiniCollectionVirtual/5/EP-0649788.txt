<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for diminishing intake vortexes in jet engines with turbo-compressors 
of aircrafts, in particular during test runs, 
characterized in that
 near 
and above the ground (8) and below and directly in front of the engine inlet 

(10), a grating (9) is disposed, having wind tunnels (14) which are formed 
by the meshes (15) of the grating (9), the height (c) of the wind tunnels (14) 

and the width (b) of the meshes (15) not exceeding a smallest blade distance 
of the turbo-compresssor of the engine (7) and the central axes (17) 

of the wind tunnels (14) being inclined relative to the ground (8) by an 
angle (e) of more than 45°. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the grating (9) has 
a semi-circular shape of a radius (r) which corresponds to twice the diameter 

(d) of the engine inlet (10). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the central 
point (11) of the grating (9) is approximately perpendicular below the center 

(12) of the engine inlet (10). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
width (b) of the meshes (15) of the grating (9) corresponds approximately 

to the height (c) of the meshes (15) or the height of the grating (9). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
distance (a) from the grating (9) to the ground (8) is adjustable.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 3 m 
<
 r 
<
 5 m 
applies to the radius (r) of the grating (9).
