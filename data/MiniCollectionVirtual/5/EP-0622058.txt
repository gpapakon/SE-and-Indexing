<ABSTRACT>
An anchoring organ for receiving prostheses, artificial joint parts and the like which is intended for implantation in tissues, preferably osseous tissues, essentially has a rotationally symmetrical design, is made of a tissue-compatible material and comprises an external screw thread (4) which is provided at least along part of its surface and extends in the direction of the insertion end, was provided with notches (7, 12) at least in zones of the external screw thread (4) in order to improve the rotational stability. At least one notch (7, 12) is provided in each turn (8) of the external screw thread located in said zone.

An anchoring element (1) intended for implantation
in tissues, preferably bone tissues, which is

essentially rotationally symmetrical in form and
consists of a tissue-compatible material, for retaining

prostheses, amputation prostheses, artificial joint
elements and suchlike, with an external screw thread

(4), running towards its insertion end, disposed along
at least a portion of its circumferential surface,

which threaded portion is at least approximately
cylindrical in form, the threaded circumferential

surface being at least zonally fashioned with indentations
(7, 12), disposed in the external screw thread

(4), which increase the torsional stability of the
element, the said zone extending over several turns and

at least one indentation (7, 12) being located in each
turn (8) of the external screw thread (4) present in

said zone, characterised in that the indentations (7,
12) are of a depth which corresponds to the depth of

the external screw thread (4) and that the thread
crests of the external screw thread (4) are rounded.
An anchoring element according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the indentations (7) are formed

by at least one helical groove (5) provided in the
external screw thread (4) of the anchoring organ (1)

and that the groove (5) has a pitch which is
significantly greater than that of the external screw

thread (4).
An anchoring element according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the pitch of the helical groove

(5) is at least three times as great as the pitch of
the external screw thread (4).
An anchoring element according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that the indentations (7) in the

external screw thread are provided, spatially separated
from one another, along a helical line. 
An anchoring element according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that two or more spatially separated

helical grooves (5) are provided.
An anchoring element according to Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that the helical grooves (5) extend

along the entire external screw thread (4).
An anchoring element according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the indentations (12) in the

external screw thread (4) are formed from essentially
axial grooves (13).
An anchoring element according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the said axial grooves (13)

extend over at least five turns (8) of the external
screw thread (4).
An anchoring element according to Claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that the indentations are formed by at

least two spatially separated axial grooves (13).
An anchoring element according to Claim 9,
characterised in that the said spatially separated

axial grooves (13) are offset in respect of their
position.
An anchoring element according to Claim 1 to 9,
characterised in that the grooves (5, 13) forming the

indentations (7, 12) have a wedge-shaped cross section.
An anchoring element according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the anchoring element (1)

consists of titanium or has a surface coating of
titanium.
