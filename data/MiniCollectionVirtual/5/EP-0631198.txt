or block copolymer comprising : 


(a) a polymer moiety having an alkyl group containing 6 - 50 
carbon atoms and a carboxyl group, said moiety being selected 

from the group consisting of : a moiety of a polymer or a 
copolymer containing at least 5 mol. % of monomer units of a 

monoalkyl ester of an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated 
dicarboxylic acid, containing 6 - 50 carbon atoms in the 

alkyl group; and a moiety of a copolymer containing 5 - 75 
mol. % of monomer units of a carboxylic group-containing α,β-ethylenically 

unsaturated monomer, and 6-80 mol.% of monomer 
units of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having an alkyl 

group containing 6 - 50 carbon atoms; and

a styrenic polymer moiety, and a polyester moiety. 
The charge controller of the present invention can be 
used for an electrophtographic toner charging negatively by 

combining this one with a toner binder and a colorant. As the 
charge controller of the invention have an excellent dispersing 

property in the toner, the toner containing thereof is excellent 
in such properties as the electrostatic charge, the charging rate 

and transparency in using for a color toner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charge control agent 
(hereinafter referred to as a charge controller), and a toner 
binder composition and an electrophotographic toner containing 
thereof. More precisely, the present invention relates to a 
charge controller charging negatively, and a toner binder 
composition and an electrophotographic toner containing thereof. It has been done previously to add a charge controller 
for the purpose of controlling the electrostatic charge of an 
electrophotographic toner. As the charge controllers charging 
negatively among the charge controllers previously known, there 
have been known an azo dyestuff compound, a salicylic acid-metal 
complex and the like. In these days, however, it becomes to be a problem from 
the safety viewpoint that these compounds contain such heavy 
metals as chrome, cobalt and zinc, and these compounds are 
originally colored ones (for example, azo dyestuff). In addition, 
there is another problem that it is difficult to disperse these  
 
compounds finely in the toner, and therefore, the charge 
distribution becomes wide. As improved compounds of the above-mentioned 
problems, such polymer compounds are proposed as 
follows : 
1) Copolymer of α-olefin and maleic anhydride (USP4,442,189). 2) Copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride (Japan Patent 
Lay-open No.60-108861). 3) Block copolymer of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid 
(USP4,925,765). By using the polymer compounds disclosed in 1) and 2), 
the problems of coloring and safety were solved. However, the 
dispersing property into the toner is poor and other properties, 
such as the electrostatic charge of the toner, the charging rate 
and the environmental stability, are also inadequate. 
Furthermore, as the transparency is poor when toner is 
formulated, a bad influence to the color tone is observed in 
applying for the color toner. The compound disclosed in 3) is the one which is intended 
to improve the dispersing property in addition to coloring and 
safety. However, the amount of the electrostatic charge of the 
toner and the charging rate are inadequate, as the charge 
controller hardly expose to the surface of the toner. It is an object of the present invention to obtain a 
essentially colorless charge controller containing no metal. Another object of the invention is to obtain a charge 
controller having excellent properties concerning the 
electrostatic charge of the toner, the charging rate and the  
 
environmental stability. Still another object of the invention is to
