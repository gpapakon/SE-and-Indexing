<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new peptide 
compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. More particularly, it relates to new peptide 
compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 
which have pharmacological activities such as tachykinin 
antagonism, especially substance P antagonism, neurokinin 
A antagonism, neurokinin B antagonism, and the like, to 
processes for preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical 
compositions comprising the same, and to a use of the same 
as a medicament. In EP-A 0 394 989 peptide compounds are disclosed, which possess a 
tachykinin antagonist activity. The peptide compounds all comprise a 
phenylalanine moiety which is optionally substituted in the para position of 
the phenyl ring with a hydroxy group. Futher peptide compounds with a tachykinin antagonist activity are 
disclosed in EP-A 0 443 132. Instead of the phenylalanine moieties (moieties) of EP-A-0 
394 989 the peptide compounds comprise a naphthylalanine moiety. One object of the present invention is to provide new 
and useful peptide compounds and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof which have pharmacological 
activities such as tachykinin antagonism, especially 
substance P antagonism, neurokinin A antagonism, 
neurokinin B antagonism, and the like. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
processes for the preparation of said peptide compounds and 
salts thereof.  
 A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an 
active ingredient, said peptide compounds and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Still further object of the present invention is to 
provide a use of said peptide compound or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as tachykinin 
antagonist, especially substance P antagonist, neurokinin 
A antagonist or neurokinin B antagonist, useful for 
treating or preventing tachykinin mediated diseases, for 
example, respiratory diseases such as asthma, hronchitis, 
rhinitis, cough, expectoration, and the like; ophthalmic 
diseases such as conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, 
and the like; cutaneous diseases such as contact 
dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and other 
eczematoid dermatitis, and the like; inflammatory diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and the 
like; pains or aches (e.g., migraine, headache, toothache, 
cancerous pain, back pain, etc.); and the like in human 
beings or animals. The object compounds of the present invention can be 
represented by the
