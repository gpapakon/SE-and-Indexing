<ABSTRACT>
A distillation column 30 for separating atmospheric gases in which structured 
packing having varying crimp angles is utilized within at least two of the 

sections I to IV or in subsections of a single one of the sections I to IV. In the 
case of the use of structured packing in multiple sections, the crimp angle of the 

structured packing used in a first section is greater than that used in a second 
section and is selected such that both sections operate at the same maximum 

design percentage of flooding limit. The increased crimp angle of the first 
section decreases the HETP of the packing and thereby allows a column design 

of reduced height. Structured packing having different crimp angles can be 
used in a single section of a column when such section is subjected to possible 

variation of vapour rate. Here the crimp angles are again selected so that the 
subsections operate at the same maximum design percentage of flooding limit. 

The distillation column 30 is thus able to operate with improved turndown 
performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distillation column in which structured packing
is utilized as a contacting element to bring liquid and gaseous phases of a
mixture of atmospheric gases to be separated into intimate contact.In fractional distillation of a mixture of atmospheric gases, components of the
mixture are separated in a distillation column. In the column, a vapour phase of
the mixture ascends with an ever increasing concentration of the more volatile
components (for instance, nitrogen) while a liquid phase of the mixture descends
with an ever increasing concentration of the less volatile components (for
instance, oxygen). Various packings are used within the distillation column to
bring the liquid and gaseous phases of the mixture into intimate contact in order
to accomplish mass transfer between the phases.Structured packing has been found to be an attractive contacting element in
many distillation applications for such reasons as simplicity of construction,
uniform performance and low pressure drop. It has long been known that the
only bar to the use of structured packing in most common distillations is cost
constraint. Therefore, it is important that the structured packing be used in the
most efficient manner from the standpoint of using the least amount of
structured packing required for the distillation column.EP-A-0-467 395, on which the pre-characterising portion of claim 1 is based,
relates to an air separation process employing at least one distillation column
which has a plurality of sections containing structured packing. In order to cater
for differences in hydraulic loan between the sections, one section has a
different packing density from another section. As will be discussed the present invention provides a column design for
separating atmospheric gases in which the height of structured packing utilized
within the column is at a minimum for the particular distillation involved.According to the present invention there is provided a distillation
column for separating atmospheric gases comprising:
at least first and second sections of equal diameter; andcrimped structured packing located in the first and second sections for bringing
liquid and gaseous phases of a mixture to be separated into intimate contact, the
first section having a lighter hydraulic loan than the second section;the structured packing utilized in the first and second sections comprising first
and second structured packings having respective first and second crimp
angles, the crimp angle being the angle of the
