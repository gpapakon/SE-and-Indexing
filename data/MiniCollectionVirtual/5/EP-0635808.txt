<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a processor-controlled machine, and a machine having a 
processor, are disclosed for producing human perceptible output related to an image display 

feature presented in an original image using the model data structure (the model) from which 
the original image was produced. In response to the display of an output producing region 

displayed coextensively with a first image segment including a display feature representing a 
data item in the model, some form of human perceptible output is produced using the data 

item and presented by an output utilization device at the same time as the first image (190) is 
being displayed, giving the perception to a machine user of providing information related to 

the display feature in the first image segment. In one aspect of the invention, the human 
perceptible output is a second image (192) displayed in the spatial context of the first image 

(190) defined by the output producing region, called a viewing operation region, or VOR (186). 
The VOR (186) functions as a type of "visual filter", binding the second view of a original image 

to the display area defined by the VOR. One type of second image (192) produced shows the 
display feature in the first image (190) modified in the second image. The second image is 

produced using a new attribute value for the data item in the model represented by the image 
display feature in the image, producing a modified display feature that is then presented in 

the VOR in the spatial context of the first image, simultaneously with the display of the first 
image and replacing the first image segment. In one illustrated embodiment, the method 

operates within the environment of a rendering application executing in a graphical user 
interface environment. A machine user moves the VOR over a portion of a rendered image, 

and in response to the user's movement action, a viewing operation associated with the VOR 
invokes the renderer that produced the original rendered image to produce a second modified 

view of the original image using a new value for a global parameter data item in the scene 
description. The second image is then clipped to the size and shape of the VOR, and is then 

presented in the VOR, showing the second modified view.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of operating a processor-controlled
machine having a display for displaying images, and to a processor-controlled
machine operated according to the method. More particularly, the present invention relates to
producing human perceptible output related to the image display features presented in a first
displayed image by operating on the model data structure from which the image was
produced, and using a displayed output producing region for identifying the relevant portion
of the image for which the human perceptible output is to be produced.A frequent and powerful use of a processor-controlled machine such as a computer is
the presentation of information in the form of images on a display device connected to the
machine. An image, which may include characters, words, and text as well as other display
features such as graphics, is produced in a display area of the display device directly from an
image definition data structure defining the image; the image definition data structure is
typically stored in a memory area of the machine. One type of image format known as a raster
image is composed of individual image locations commonly referred to as "pixels". The
discussion of images herein will generally reference pixel data, but it is to be understood that
other data formats, such as vector data, may also be used to define an image. The images
discussed herein may be either static (having the appearance to a system operator or user of
not moving), or animated, as, for example, in the case of a digital video imageAn image definition data structure alone carries relatively limited data about the
information content of the image the data represent. However, for many images, the image
definition data structure is itself generated from another data structure which contains
information or data capable of being understood by a human or by a software operation such
as an application program which is executed by the machine's processor. Such a data structure
will be referred to herein as the "information model data structure" or the "model data
structure", and is to be distinguished from the image definition data structure.An example of an information model data structure is a model from which a graphics
image, such as a photorealistic scene, is generated. The model, also called a scene description,
contains descriptions of primitives that define the shapes of components, objects, and light
sources in a three-dimensional scene, the displayed appearance attributes
