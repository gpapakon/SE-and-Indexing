<ABSTRACT>
A filter plate moving apparatus has on filter presses a carriage (8) which can be moved back and forth along guide rails by means of a cable line (5) and bears a pawl (21), which during the carriage return movement respectively engages behind a bearing block (13) of the front filter plate in the filter plate assembly, and a drop lever (23), which during the carriage return movement is in each case directed against the front filter plate. To increase the functional reliability it is provided that on the carriage (8) there is mounted a control lever (9) which can be swivelled by means of the cable line (5) about a horizontal axis (10) between two stops (24, 25) fixed on the carriage, engages under the drop lever (23) and changes the drop lever (23) and the pawl (21), resting on the latter, over between a down-position during plate transport and an up-position during the carriage return movement, the pawl (21) and the drop lever (23) still engaging in the path of movement (40) of the filter plates (1) even in the up-position.

A device on filter presses for moving each front filter plate (1) in a stack (4)
of filter plates suspended from upper guide rails (2, 3), the device comprising a

slide (8) which is movable in reciprocation by a cable (5) along the guide rails (2,
3) and carries a drive paw (21) which engages behind the front filter plate (1)

during each return movement of the slide and also bears a drop lever (23) which
is directed against the front filter plate at each return movement of the slide and

has a movable end which extends under an abutment (22) on the drive pawl (21),
characterised in that a control lever (9) grips under the drop lever (23) and is

pivotable by the cable (5) around a horizontal axis (10) between two abutments
(24, 25) secured to the slide (8) and guides the drop lever (23) and the drive paw

(21) resting on it between a low position during conveyance of the plates and a
high position during the return movement of the slide, and even in the high position

the drive paw (21) and the drop lever (23) still engage in the path (40) of motion
of the filter plates (1).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the drop lever (23)
running on to the newly-forming stack (4') of filter plates during conveyance

thereof raises the drive pawl (21) resting on it, up to a high position in which the
drive paw (21) lies above the path (40) of the filter plates (1).
A device according to claims 1 and claim 2, characterised in that in the stack
(4) of filter plates, each filter plate (1) is locked by a locking paw (14) to the next

filter plate, and the locking paw (14) of each front filter plate is unlockable by the
drive paw (21).
A device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the abutments
(24, 25) secured to the slide are adjustable for the control lever (9) and the

abutment (22) on the drive pawl (21) is adjustable for the drop lever (23). 
A device according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the drive pawl (21)
is biased by a spring (31) in the direction towards the drop lever (23).
A device according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the slide (8) is
guided in non-tiltable manner on rails (6, 7) attached to the guide rails (2, 3) and

is equipped with an adjustable brake (43).
A device according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in that two similar control
levers (9) are provided and grip the drop lever (23) between them and each have

a bent arm (30) which grips under a cam (28, 29) projecting from the drop lever
(23).
A device according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the two control
levers (9) are connected by a cross-member (37) to which the cable (5) is attached

in the middle.
A device according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in that a rotating cable
(5) is used and is equipped with an overload safety device.
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that the non-driven guide
pulley (38) of the cable (5) is biased by a spring (39) which determines the cable

tension.
