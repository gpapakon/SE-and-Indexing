<ABSTRACT>
To provide a filter medium for an automobile exhaust gas which has a high capability of collecting solid and liquid components 
of an exhaust gas and a sufficiently high resistance to the combustion cleaning heat, and a method of manufacturing the 

same. A three-dimensional reticulated metallic porous material of Ni-Cr-Al 
with fibrous crystals of alumina densely set on the 

surface of its three-dimensional skeleton is heated to 800°-1000°C in the atmospheric air, and the resultant material is used as a 
filter medium. Accordingly, the filter medium has excellent filtration performance and corrosion resistance, and withstands a 

high temperature. This filter medium is capable of firmly supporting a catalyst on the fibrous crystals of alumina constituting the 
surface of the filter medium. The increased surface area can support an increased amount of catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter member for 
purifying exhausts for use in an exhaust purifying device 
of an automobile or a kerosene fan heater and method for 
manufacturing the same. Particulates (solid components such as soot) 
discharged from diesel-powered vehicles are becoming a big 
social problem. Automobile manufacturers are endeavoring 
to develop filter systems which can effectively collect 
such particulates. Among them, there is known a filter 
formed of honeycomb-shaped cordierite ceramics. This 
filter can collect particulates with high efficiency but 
has a problem in that it tends to develop heat spots, 
melting or cracks when heated to remove the collected 
particulates and regenerate the filter. Thus, a 
complicated control system was needed. A diesel engine car is advantageous over a gasoline-powered 
car in that the fuel cost is lower. But this 
advantage will be offset if the cost for treating exhaust 
is high. Thus, it is desired to develop a filter member 
which is high in particulate-collecting capacity and  
 
resistant to heat and requires no special protective means. In an exhaust purifying device for use in cars or 
kerosene fan heaters is used a catalyst made of a precious 
metal (such as platinum) to purify exhausts by chemically 
reacting them. Such a catalyst is provided on the surface of a 
honeycomb-shaped carrier made of cordierite. Such a 
conventional carrier has a relatively smooth surface and 
thus is low in catalyst carrying capacity. On the other hand, today's automobiles and kerosene 
fan heaters tend to discharge higher temperature exhausts 
than ever before as a result of technological advancements 
in burning fuel in an automotive engine or burning kerosene 
in a burner. One problem with a conventional carrier is 
that it cannot maintain its exhaust purifying effect for so 
long a period of time because the catalyst tends to peel 
off during use if the carrier is repeatedly heated and 
cooled. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide a filter member for purifying exhaust gas which is 
resistant to heat and high in particulate-collecting 
capacity and which can stably carry its catalyst even if 
repeatedly heated and cooled in a high-temperature 
environment or subjected to vibrations, and a method of 
manufacturing the same.  In order to solve the above problems, according to 
this invention, there is provided a filter member 
comprising a three-dimensional mesh-like metallic porous 
member having a three-dimensional framework and made from
