<ABSTRACT>
A lipcare cosmetic composition containing as 
ingredients an emollient including castor oil, a wax, a 

suspending agent, a coloring agent and as an additional 
ingredient, an organosilicon compound. This composition 

increases the durability of lipcare products by including an 
alkylmethylpolysiloxane having the formula 


in which 
x
 has a value of 1-300; 
y
 has a value of 1-50; and 
z
 
has a value of 5-50.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to personal care 
products and, more particularly, to a cosmetic composition in 
the form of a lip care preparation containing certain 
alkylmethylsilicone copolymers. Inclusion of alkylmethyl-silicone 
copolymers in compositions formulated for lip care 
has been found by us to contribute to the durability and, 
hence, the increased wearability of lip products by 
consumers. Lipstick is one of the most widely used decorative 
cosmetic preparations. The primary duties of lip care 
preparations including lipsticks are to prevent the drying 
and cracking of the lips, to impart color to pale lips, to 
alter the shape of the lips and to match lip color with the 
color of hair, accessories or clothing. Its handy form 
enables a female to renew her make-up repeatedly throughout 
the day and to achieve a fresh look or to add a protective 
coating. Consumers expect a lip care product which can be 
applied effortlessly, which produces an even coating on the 
lips of a desired thickness and which possesses a reasonable 
amount of durability and life expectancy. Such lip care products run the gamut from a lip fix 
which is used as a base before applying a color lipstick, a 
lip gloss which is applied last and provides the lips with a 
strong stylish sheen, to a lip contour pencil which frames 
the lips with a line. Because many lip care products include 
color, the staining of various items which come into contact 
with the lips is always a possibility and an otherwise 
undesirable feature. Therefore, whatever the form of the 
product, durability is one of the important expectations of a 
successful, over-the-counter cosmetic lip care product.  The present invention relates to color cosmetic 
sticks such as lipsticks, cover make-up sticks and eyeshadow 
pencils. These color cosmetic sticks have been found to be 
harder to remove from the skin and lips by rubbing. Our 
stick products exhibit improved wearability, substantivity 
and durability, because of the presence in the stick product 
of certain alkylmethylsilicone copolymers. The copolymer as 
an essential ingredient in the stick product functions to 
increase the wear time of the stick product and prevents 
transfer of the cosmetic in comparison to cosmetic products 
which do not contain the copolymer. In addition, the 
products of this invention have been observed to exhibit the 
added benefits of improved gloss of the stick itself and 
improved gloss of the cosmetic on the skin and lips, due to 
the presence in the cosmetic stick
