<ABSTRACT>
A medicament and a method for treating corns and calluses is claimed. The medicament contains an effective amount of at least one saturated (alpha)-hydroxy fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, or salts or esters thereof. The medicament can be in the form of a liquid preparation or a medicated device which contains the saturated (alpha)-hydroxy fatty acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 X-HYDROXY SATURATED FATTY ACIDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CORNS AND CALLUSESBACKGROUND Corns and calluses are examples of hyperkeratosis.Hyperkeratosis is hypertrophy of the stratum corneum (ie., outer layer of the skin) caused by excess production of keratinized tissue relative to shedding of keratinized tissue. Essentially, hyperkeratotic tissue forms where more stratum corneum is being made than is being lost. According to the Handbook of Nonprescription Drugs, EighthEdition, American Pharmaceutical Association, 1986, Chapter 33 Footcare Products, pp. 655-687, corns and calluses are strikingly similar in one respect: each has a marked hypertrophy of the stratum corneum. Beyond this feature, however, there are marked differences. A corn (clavus) is a small, sharply demarcated, hyperkeratotic lesion having a central core. It is raised, has a yellowish gray color, and ranges from a few millimeters to one centimeter or more in diameter. The apex of the corn points inward and presses on the nerve endings in the dermis, causing pain. A callus is different from a corn in that it has no central core, has more diffuse thickening of the skin and generally occurs in different locations on the body. It has indefinite borders and can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. It is usually raised, yellow and has a normal pattern of skin ridges on its surface. Besides joints, calluses form on weight-bearing areas, such as the palms of the hands and sides and soles of the feet.U.S. Patent 5,091 ,171 discloses generically, that amphoteric compositions containing the dimeric or polymeric forms of hydroxyacids may be useful in treating cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders in human and animals, including dry skin, dandruff, acne, keratoses, psoriasis, eczema, pruitus, age spots, lentigines, melasmas, wrinkles, warts, blemished skin, hyperpigmented skin, hyperkeratotic skin, inflammatory dermatoses, skin changes associated with aging and as skin cleaners. U.S. Patent 4,824,865 discloses that 2-hydroxyoctanoic acid, 2-ketooctanoic acid and their C2 to C& alkyl esters are useful in treating 

callous-forming disorders, notably palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, including corns. A number of other agents have been taught for treating corns or calluses such as glacial acetic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, phenoxyacetic acid, zinc chloride, ascorbic acid, calcium pantothenate, cantharidin, podophyllum and bleomycin sulfate. It would be desirable, however, to provide undiscovered alternative

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS:
1. A medicament for treating corns and calluses containing an effective amount of at least one saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, or salts or esters thereof.
2. A medicament as claimed in claim 1 wherein the saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid is applied in a liquid preparation.
3. A medicament as claimed in claims 1-2 wherein the amount of saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid in the liquid preparation ranges from about 5 to about 25 percent by weight of the liquid preparation.
4. A medicament as claimed in claim 1 which is a medicated device comprising at least one saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, or salts or esters thereof, admixed into a plaster preparation.
5. A medicament as claimed in claim 4 wherein the saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid is present in the plaster preparation in an amount ranging from about 15 to about 80 percent by weight of the plaster preparation.
6. A medicament as claimed in claims 1-5 wherein the saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid is α-hydroxy lauric acid (C-12), α-hydroxy myristic acid (C-14) or α-hydroxy stearic acid (C-18).
7. A method for treating corns and calluses, comprising contacting the affected area with a liquid preparation or medicated device containing an effective amount of at least one saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, or salts or esters thereof, to effect softening or loosening of the corn or callus for removal thereof.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid is applied in a liquid preparation in an amount ranging from about 5 to about
25 percent by weight of the liquid preparation. 


9. The method of claim 7 wherein the medicated device comprises at least one saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, or salts or esters thereof in a plaster preparation.
10 . The method of claims 7-9 wherein the saturated α-hydroxy fatty acid isα-hydroxy lauric acid (C-12), α-hydroxy myristic acid (C-14) or α-hydroxy stearic acid (C-18).
