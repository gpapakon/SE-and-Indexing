<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combined oven for cooking foods comprising a control panel which includes, on the one hand, means (11) for selecting a heating sequence to be applied, a type of food and its weight, and, on the other hand, control means (8) linked to information processing means (9) which comprise a main processor (10) determining a heating time on the basis of the selection means. According to the invention, the information processing means (9), on the one hand, are connected to a display means (12) and, on the other hand, comprise a slave processor (13) linked with the main processor (10) by a bidirectional bus (14) and to which are connected the selection means (11), a storage memory (15) containing information selectable by the selection means (11) and the display means (12) for depicting the selectable information.

<CLAIMS>
Oven comprising an enclosure (2) for cooking
foodstuffs including an electrical resistance-type

browning device (3), a rotating-heat device (4) and a
microwave energy generation device (5), a power supply

circuit for supplying the electrical resistance-type
browning device and/or the rotating-heat device and/or

the microwave energy generation device, and a control
panel which includes, on the one hand, selection means

(11) making it possible to choose a heating sequence to
be applied in the said enclosure (2) and invoking the

browning device (3) and/or the rotating-heat device (4)
and/or the microwave energy generation device (5), and

to input the type of foodstuff and its weight, and, on
the other hand, control means (8) linked to information-processing

means (9) which comprise a main computer
(10) determining a heating time on the basis of

the selection means and which trigger the operation of
the power supply circuit, characterised in that the information-processing

means (9), on the one hand, are
connected to visual-display means (12) displaying the

calculated heating time as well as a representation of
the browning device (3) and/or of the rotating-heat device

(4) and/or of the microwave energy generation device
(5) activated when the power supply circuit is

triggered, and, on the other hand, comprise a slave
computer (13) linked with the main computer (10) via a

bidirectional bus (14) and to which are connected the
selection means (11), a storage memory (15) containing

information which can be selected via the selection
means (11) and the visual-display means (12) for displaying

the information which can be selected.
Cooking oven according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the visual-display means (12) comprises a first

visual-display means (20) connected to the main computer 
(10) and a second visual-display means (21) connected

to the slave computer (13).
Cooking oven according to either of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the storage memory

(15) contains:

n files, each containing a given list, in a language
of a given country, of a certain number of types of

foodstuffs;
a defined number i of heating sequences to be applied
to each type of foodstuff;
code numbers Î±
i
 each corresponding to a particular
type of foodstuff on the basis of a given heating sequence.
Cooking oven according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the number i of heating sequences to be selected

is of the order of 4 and corresponds either to
defrosting, or to reheating, or to cooking, or to cooking-browning-cooking

au gratin-roasting.
Cooking oven according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the control means (8)

comprise a start-up button (24) for triggering the activation
of the information-processing means and a test

button (25) for checking the processing means.
Method of operation of an oven according to
Claim 5, characterised in that, upon the first actuation

of any one of the selection means (11) by the
user, the control means (8) allow triggering of the excitation

of the main computer (10) which, via a subprogramme,
triggers the compiling of a first message M
1

containing a turn-on command and the main computer (10)
sends the slave computer (13) the said first message M
1

as well as a word for selecting a language of a particular
country, the slave computer (13), after receiving

the first message M
1
 and the language selection
word, sends an acknowledgement of reception AR to the

main computer (10), the slave computer (13) triggers 
the activation of the visual-display means (12) of the

selection means, then, when the selection means (11)
are actuated a second time by the user, the visual-display

means (12) displays the type of foodstuff selected
by the user, the weight of the said foodstuff as

well as the heating sequence determined and, when the
user actuates either the start-up button (24) or the

test button (25), the control means (8) trigger either
the start of a heating sequence determined by the information-processing

means (9) on the basis of the selection
means (11), or a check on the said heating sequence

determined by the processing means (9) respectively
without starting the said heating sequence, the

said check allowing the user to look up the selected
and calculated information or to make changes to the

heating operation determined before the oven is started
up.
Method of operation for an oven according to
Claim 6, characterised in that, with the user actuating

the start-up button (24), the main computer transfers
into its storage memory (15) the information output by

the selection means (11) and contained in the storage
memory (15) linked to the slave computer (13), the main

computer (10) calculates the heating time to be applied
and corresponding to the heating sequence determined,

the visual-display means displays the said heating time
as well as a representation of the browning device

and/or of the rotating-heat device and/or of the microwave
energy generation device operating for the said

selected heating sequence, the main computer triggers
the operation of the power supply circuit and inhibits

the slave computer, the main computer determines the
end of the selected heating sequence, triggers its quiescent

state, and sends the slave computer an end-of-operation
message entailing the second visual-display 

means being switched off and the said slave computer
being set to standby position.
Method of operation for an oven according to
Claim 6, characterised in that, with the user actuating

the test button (24), the main computer transfers into
its information memory the information output by the

selection means and contained in the storage memory
linked to the slave computer, and the main computer

calculates the heating time to be applied to the foodstuff
to be processed, the first visual-display means

displays the said calculated heating time as well as a
representation of the browning device and/or of the rotating-heat

device and/or of the microwave energy generation
device put into operation during the heating

operation chosen by the processing means, the main computer
and the slave computer being active for a time 
t

in the course of which the user can alter, cancel or
trigger the heating operation determined by the information-processing

means and returning to a quiescent
state if no action is triggered.
