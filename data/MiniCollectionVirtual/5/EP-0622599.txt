<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger includes upper and lower tanks (2, 3), a 
plurality of parallel heat transfer tubes (8) fluidly 

interconnected between the upper and lower tanks (2, 3), a 
plurality of reinforcing members connecting an upper wall (2a, 

3a) and a lower wall (2b, 3b) of the upper and lower tanks (2, 
3), and a communication path (9) associated with each 

reinforcing member. The reinforcing members increase the 
strength of the tan
k walls against deformation due to the high 
pressure working fluid without increasing the thickness of the 

walls or increasing the spacing between the tubes (8). The 
communication path (9) ensures efficient flow of a heat medium 

in the tanks (2, 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat exchanger suitable
for use in an air conditioning system for vehicles, and more
particularly to an improved heat exchanger having a pair of
tanks and a plurality of heat transfer tubes interconnected
therebetween.Figures 4 to 6 depict a conventional heat exchanger used
in an air conditioning system, for example, an evaporator or a
condenser. In Figures 4 and 5, a heat exchanger 101 includes
an upper tank 102 and a lower tank 103. Upper tank 102
includes an upper wall 102a and a lower wall 102b. Lower tank
103 includes an upper wall 103a and a lower wall 103b. A
plurality of heat transfer tubes 104 are fluidly interconnected
between lower wall 102b of upper tank 102 and upper wall 103a of
lower tank 103. Inlet pipe 105 and outlet pipe 106 are
connected to upper tank 102. A heat medium, for example,
refrigerant, introduced into inlet pipe 105 flows in heat
exchanger 101 from inlet pipe 105 to outlet pipe 106, for
example, as shown in Figure 7. When the heat medium flows
through heat transfer tubes 104, heat exchange between the heat
medium and air flow 107 passing through the heat transfer tubes
104 is performed.In such a conventional heat exchanger, however, because
each tank 102, 103 is formed from a thin and flat plate (for 
example, aluminum plate or aluminum alloy plate), the tank walls
may become deformed, as shown by the dashed lines in Figures
4-6, when the pressure in the tanks exceeds a certain level.
Upper wall 102a of upper tank 102 and lower wall 103b of lower
tank 103 are particularly likely to be deformed.In addressing this problem, two alternative tank
constructions have been proposed. The first employs relatively
thicker plates, while in the second, partitions are used to
connect the upper and lower walls. The former construction
increases the weight and cost of the heat exchanger. The latter
construction requires a complicated mold for forming a tank,
and also increases the cost of the heat exchanger. Further, if
too many partitions are disposed in the tank, the heat medium
encounters higher fluid resistance. This reduces the efficiency of
the heat exchanger.It would be desirable to provide a heat exchanger with
tanks having a sufficiently high degree of internal pressure
resistance without using a thick plate material, and to
manufacture inexpensively a compact, light-weight and efficient
heat exchanger. GB-A-194734 discloses a heat exchanger including an
upper tank, a lower tank spaced from the upper tank; a
plurality of parallel heat transfer

<CLAIMS>
A heat exchanger including an upper tank (2), a lower
tank (3) spaced from the upper tank; a plurality of

parallel heat transfer tubes (8,17) fluidly interconnecting
the upper and lower tanks; means (17b) for reinforcing at

least one of the upper and lower tanks by connecting an
upper wall and a lower wall (2a,2b or 3a,3b) thereof; and

a communication path (18) associated with each of the
reinforcing means, the communication paths providing fluid

communication between the interior of the heat transfer
tubes and the interior of the tank(s); wherein the

reinforcing means comprises a tip portion (17b) of each of
the heat transfer tubes (17), the tip portion extending

into the interior of the tank through one of the upper and
lower walls (2b,3a) and connected to the wall (2a,3b)

opposite to the wall through which the tip portion extends;
and the communication paths comprising openings (18) in

portions of the heat transfer tubes positioned in the
interior of the tank(s); characterised in that a stepped

portion (16) is formed on each of the heat transfer tubes
(17) the stepped portion abuttingly engaging an outer

surface of the wall (2b,3a) through which the tip portion
extends.
A heat exchanger according to claim 1, wherein the
opening (18) is formed at a position near to the opposite

wall (2a,3b).
A heat exchanger according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein each of the heat transfer tubes (17) is brazed to

the upper and lower walls of at least one of the upper and
lower tanks (2,3).
