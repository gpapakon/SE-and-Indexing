<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to keyboards of the divided type, whereby each hand is 
assigned a key group cluster; and in particular, this invention addresses the notion of dual 
vertically oriented keyboards. Heretofore, there have been various interesting keyboard inventions having the 
apparent intent of improving the psychophysiological human-engineering aspects of efficient 
hand/finger mind coordination. However, none have actually addressed the currently more 
critical problem area traumatically impacting the physiopathology involved in intense 
repetative-motion tasks; particularly such task procedures involving one's upper 
extremities, -that is perse, the finger-thumb/hand//wrist/elbow/shoulder cooperatively  
 
articulated aggregation. Accordingly, in order to better understand the RMI(repetitive-motion 
injury)-disease pathogenesis involved in the occurance of so called Carpal-tunnel 
Syndrome, review of certain authorative medical articles as well as relevant prior patent-art 
is in order. For example, in the well respected American periodical "Occupational 
Health & Safety" (date?), Dr.S.J.Barrer-MD states that more study and information is now 
being directed toward job-induced cumulative-trauma disorders, than that known in the 
previous two-decades; -and carpal-tunnel syndrome(CTS) Is the most devastating 
contender. He goes on to state that RMI induced CTS just a decade ago accounted for 
about 18% of occupational injuries, while more recently that figure has risen to some 48%. 
Dr.Barrer points out that in the past, using a typewriter meant occassionally pausing to 
make corrections by hand, rolling paper into and out of the carriage, pausing to look-up 
spelling of a word, etc.. These job "break interruptions" of repetitive-motion procedures are 
now becoming so automated, that as result, physical movement is much more intently 
repetitive- a word-processor operator may now perform some 23,000-keystrokes in a 
single uninterrupted period, with no relieving variation, -no "wrist rest" time. Dr.Barrer 
advises that the resultant stress is far more than the wrist was anatomically designed to 
handle. Although a single digital motion upon a modern touch-sensitive key may involve 
what seems a minor Â½-lb. of pressure, the cumulative RM/loading-factor in one period can 
extrapolate to some 6-tons of working pressure! Hence, Dr.Barrer goes on to say, it is such 
repetition without adequate recovery-time which causes pain, inflammation, and swelling in 
the wrist's carpal-tunnel region. Excessive

<CLAIMS>
A keyboard (10) electrically 
connectable to a computer (11) for informational input to the computer (11), 

,wherein 

a )
 a keyboard frame (23) of substantially rigid construction adapted to 
lay across an operator's (13) lap during use, the frame (23) defining a directional 

reference when the frame (23) lies across an operator's (13) lap; 
b )
 a left spaced hand keypad member (24) extending substantially vertically up from 
said keyboard frame (23) so as to present it's vertically-oriented panel face (32) toward the lateral left while 

projected in a vertical plane, facilitating a substantially neutral wrist arc attitude, while 
providing a substantially neutral rotary wrist attitude, 

and including a mirror (22) arranged at an angle toward the operator (13) and set 
closely aftward while immediately outward thereto said keypad member (24), the mirror (22) 

being mounted for providing instant eye reference to 
the resultantly vertically-oriented individual finger-key surfaces (33), and 
c )
 a right spaced hand keypad member (24') extending substantially vertically up from 
said keyboard frame (23) so as to present it's vertically-oriented panel face (32') toward the lateral right while 

projected in a vertical plane, facilitating a substantially neutral wrist arc attitude, while 
providing a substantially neutral rotary wrist attitude, 

and including a mirror (22') arranged at an angle toward the operator and set 
closely aftward while immediately outward thereto s
aid keypad member (24'), the mirror (22') 
being mounted for providing instant eye reference to 

the resulting vertically-oriented individual finger-key surfaces (33). 
A keyboard according to Claim 1, 
wherein said vertical keypad members (24,24') include lateral repositioning means (26) by which they 

may be finitely adjusted according to the particular shoulder width dimension of any given 
operator (13). 
A keyboard according to Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said discrete right and left reference mirrors (22,22') are substantially enshrouded 

in a fully integrated manner with the said keypad members (24,24'); thereby protecting the mirror 
adjustment from inadvertant disposition. 
A keyboard according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein said right and left keypad finger-keys bear reverse mirror image reference 

character indicia upon the finger contact surface (33), thereby reading conventionally via image 
reflected through said visual reference mirrors (22,22'). 
A keyboard according to Claim 4, wherein said reversed 
character image indicia are rotated 90-degrees. 
A keyboard according to any of Claims 1 to 5 
wherein said keypad panel areas also include provision of a hemisphere portion of a ball 

tracking-mouse (35).  
 
A keyboard according to any of Claims 1 to 6, 
wherein is included provision for plug-in installation of a substantially conventional ten-key 

type accounting-panel having special modular invertible attachment means (43), to be aligned 
substantially as an extension of the existing keypad surface, whereby a single invertible 

panel (39) may thus serve either at the right or left hand positions; including provision within 
the opposite ends of said keyboard's primary shelf portion of an extendable subshelf 

structure (25) having integral female receptacles (44) serving to receive said ten-key panel, 
whereby said ten-key panel may be readily detached therefrom when desired, and the 

subshelf portion concealed when retracted back within the confines of said keyboard 
primary shelf portion. 
A keyboard according to any of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein discretely opposed left and right hand supporting means (21,21') are substantially 

horizontal shelf like surface formations extending laterally outward from said respective 
keypad panel surfaces (32) at an approximate right-angle. 
A keyboard according to Claim 8, wherein both discrete said 
keypad panels (32) include a rigid integrating housing formation (29,29'), serving to unite the panel plane 

with said hand supporting means (21,21') while substantially enshrouding said adjacent 
mirror as well. 
A keyboard according to any of Claims 1 to 9, 
wherein said keyboard structure includes provision of substantial lateral expansion and 

contraction sliding means (25,25',25''), whereby the attendant keypad members arranged near the 
opposite transverse ends of said keyboard may be readily repositioned according to the 

torso width of any given operator.
