<ABSTRACT>
A game toy providing pleasurableness that cannot be obtained with a game toy simply copying an actual game 
by being configured such that players compete against each other for the number of captured pieces by avoiding release 

of captured pieces, said game toy comprising piece holding means (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) for holding pieces captured by a 
player in a predetermined position, a mover (3) for moving said pieces so captured from said predetermined position 

by colliding therewith, collision avoiding means (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) for avoiding collision of said mover with said pieces 
when operated by the players when said mover (3) approaches said pieces, supporting means (5) for supporting said 

mover (3) rotatably in a vertical direction, and driving means for rotating said supporting means (5) about a vertical 
axis direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a game toy with which players compete 
to see who can avoid collision of a moving object with their piece 
and hold on their piece. There are a wide variety of contests, such as tennis, ping 
pong, etc., with which points are scored by the opposing player 
when the moving object, such as a ball, etc., of one player enters 
the specified region of the other player and the player on whose 
side the ball has entered cannot stop the moving object, and games 
that imitate this type of contest have also been presented. However, conventional games simply imitate actual contests and 
it cannot be said that they provide amusement different from the 
actual contest for which points are competed. Therefore, an object of this invention is to present a game 
toy which provides amusement that cannot be obtained with games 
simulating actual contests, because it is structured so that players 
compete for the number of pieces by avoiding the loss of a piece. This invention is characterized by that it has a piece 
retaining means for holding a player's piece at the desired position, 
a moving object which moves the piece from the position by colliding  
 
with the piece, a collision prevention meanes which the player 
operates in order to avoid collision of the moving object with the 
piece when the moving object is close to the piece, a support means 
that supports the moving object so that it can freely spin in the 
vertical direction, and a drive meanes which rotates said support 
meanes around the vertical axis. Under the preferred embodiment of the invention, the game toy 
has a stopper meanes for stopping the moving object so that it is 
held in a vertical state and a release means with which the player 
can release the suspension. It is preferred that the stopper means comprises a movable pin 
which has an end engage with a concave section or hole in the moving 
object in order to stop the moving object. It is also preferred that the moving object has a colliding 
part that collides with the piece at its front end and a spindle at 
its back end, with the moving object being supported so that it can 
freely spin around a fulcrum near the back end. It is further preferred that the collision prevention means 
have a lever supported so that it can spin freely up and down and a 
spring at one end of said lever attached so that it can spin freely 
at the desired angle with regard to a direction in which the moving 
object is moving, and the collision prevention meanes is made so 
that when the

<CLAIMS>
A game toy which is characterized by comprising: 
   a piece retaining means for holding a player's piece at a 

desired position; 
   a moving object for moving said piece from said position by 

colliding with said piece; 
   a collision prevention means for avoiding collision of said 

moving object with said piece by operation of a player when said 
moving object is close to said piece; 

   a support means for supporting said moving object so that it 
can freely spin in a vertical direction; and 

   a drive means for rotating said support means around a 
vertical axis. 
The game toy according to claim 1, which is characterized by 
comprising a stopper means for stopping said moving object so that it 

is held in a vertical state and a release means with which said 
player can release said stopper means. 
The game toy according to claim 2, which is characterized in 
that said stopper means comprises a movable pin which has an end 

engage with a concave section or hole in said moving object in order 
to stop said moving object. 
The game toy according to one of claims 1 to 3, which is 
characterized in that said moving object has a colliding part which 

collides with said piece at a front end and a spindle at a back end 
of said moving object, with said moving object being supported so 

that it can freely spin around a fulcrum near said back end. 
The game toy according to claim 1, which is characterized by 
that said collision prevention means has a lever supported so that 

it can spin freely up and down and a spring at one end of said lever 
attached so that it can spin freely at a predetermined angle with 

regard to a direction in which said moving object is moving, and said 
collision prevention means is made so that said moving object jumps 

due to a force of said spring when said player pushes other end of 
said lever.
