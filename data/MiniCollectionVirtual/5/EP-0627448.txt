<ABSTRACT>
A supported catalyst for olefin polymerization 
comprising a Group IV-B metallocene component and an 

ionic activator componenet comprising a cation capable 
of donating a proton and a labile bulky anion having a 

plurality of lipophilic radicals so that the anion is 
sterically hindered from covalently bonding with a 

cation produced from the Group IV-B metal of the 
metallocene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to supported catalysts for polymerization of olefins including gas or slurry phase polymerization of olefins, diolefins, cyclic olefins and acetylenically unsaturated monomers. These catalysts, which may be supported on known catalyst supports, include a Group IV-B metal metallocene compound and an ionic activator compound. While the homogeneous variant of this catalyst system has been previously disclosed in EP-277004-A a supported form of the catalyst system has not heretofore been produced. The supported catalyst, suitable for use in gas or slurry phase olefin polymerization, provides a polymer product having a narrower particle size distribution and higher bulk density than achievable with the homogeneous catalyst system. Furthermore, the use of the supported catalyst in the gas phase results in greatly reduced reactor fouling as compared to the unsupported or homogeneous variant. By employing suitably sized supports, the catalyst system can be employed in solution and high pressure polymerization processes.Ziegler-Natta type catalysts for the polymerization of olefins are well known. The traditional Ziegler-Natta type systems comprise a metal halide activated to a catalyst species by reaction with a metal alkyl cocatalyst, particularly an aluminum alkyl cocatalyst. The activation of these traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts generates a variety of different active sites. As a consequence of this non-uniformity of the active sites, the catalysts produce polymer products of broad molecular weight distribution (MWD). Furthermore, the copolymer products exhibit broad composition distribution (CD), poor comonomer incorporation and blocky sequence distribution.Recently it has been found that active catalysts are formed when a bis(cyclopentadienyl) compound of the Group IV-B metals, in particular zirconium and hafnium, is activated by an alumoxane. The metallocene-alumoxane catalysts whether homogeneous or supported generally possess high activity and are more versatile than conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts in that they may be effectively used to produce a variety of polymer products including, for example, high density linear polyethylene (HDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), ethylene-propylene copolymer (EP), non-crystalline polypropylene and crystalline polypropylene. The metallocene-alumoxane catalysts also offer the significant advantage over the traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts of being able to produce polymers with narrow MWD.While the metallocene-alumoxane
