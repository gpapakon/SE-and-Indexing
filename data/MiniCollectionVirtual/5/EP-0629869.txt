<ABSTRACT>
Test apparatus for vibration diagnosis of a printed 
circuit board and its components includes a portable probe (1) 

having a vibrating head (12) which is held in contact with 
each integrated circuit on the board. Vibration levels are 

monitored by an accelerometer (7) whose output is incorporated 
in a feedback loop, thereby maintaining a controlled level of 

excitation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods suitable
for the testing of electronic components which are mounted on
printed circuit boards.WO-A-89/12379 describes a system for detecting free
particles in component housings assembled on a printed circuit
board. The board is secured to a vibrating table and a
piezoelectric sensor, placed on individual integrated circuit
packages listens for sound impacts generated by free particles
trapped within. Vibration levels of the table can be
monitored and controlled by means of an accelerometer mounted
thereon. However, the system described therein fails to
provide a means for applying vibration locally to an
integrated circuit package and also fails to provide a means
for measuring the local vibration levels that the package
sustains during a test procedure.To ensure that an item of electronics equipment is
reliable in the field it is standard practice to condition
equipment to eliminate early failures. This process is known
by a number of terms including:- Environmental Stress
Screening, In-Process Conditioning, and the related term
Burn-In.These processes involve placing equipment in
environmental chambers and subjecting them to repeated cycles
of temperature extremes (typical -30°C +50°C) plus vibration
over a total period of 4 to 40 hours typical. Units are
stimulated by external equipment such as a vibrating platform, 
for example, and critical signals are monitored by computer to
record any failures. All equipment that survives such tests
can be statistically proven to be more reliable.With a large throughput of such equipment there are bound
to be failures that require diagnosis. If something breaks or
shows the same problem under ambient conditions this is not
too difficult to resolve. If it sometimes only fails at a
temperature extreme or with vibration applied this is a
difficult problem to diagnose.Whereas there are a number of items which can be used to
diagnose thermally induced problems e.g. heat guns, freezer
sprays, this invention aims to provide a method and apparatus
for diagnosis of vibration related failures. Furthermore the
invention aims to provide a controlled, portable, local source
of vibration.Hence this invention consists of an apparatus for testing
the performance of electronic components under vibratory
conditions, the apparatus including a probe body having a
probe head for coupling to an electronic component, means for
monitoring vibratory levels and charaterised in that the probe
body includes means for vibrating the probe head
