<CLAIMS>
A process for coating porous, hydrophobic substrates 
with thermoplastic fluoropolymers, which comprises 

bringing the substrate into contact with an aqueous 
dispersion of a thermoplastic fluoropolymer having 

a number-average particle size of up to 100 nm, if 
appropriate under pressure, and then after-treating 

the substrate thus impregnated with heat to fix the 
fluoropolymer. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
impregnation of the substrate with the dispersion 

takes place under pressure. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
after-treatment with heat is carried out first at a 

temperature of 100 to 150Â°C and then at a sufficiently 
high temperature to ensure sintering or 

fusion of the fluoropolymer to form a dense coating. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the number-average particle size 

in the fluoropolymer dispersion is up to 50 nm. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the number-average particle size 

in the fluoropolymer dispersion is up to 30 nm. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the fluoropolymer is a copolymer 

with units of tetrafluoroethylene and a fluoroalkyl 
perfluorovinyl ether.  

 
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
copolymer additionally contains units of hexafluoropropene. 
The use of a coated substrate obtained according to 
one or more of the preceding claims in chemical 

apparatus construction.
