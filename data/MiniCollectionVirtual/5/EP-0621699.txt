<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement is inserted into an optical fibre (13.1, 13.2) on which independent light beams of two different wavelengths and different directions run. The arrangement has four directional fibre amplifiers (21, 121, 23, 123) which are inserted individually into partial fibres (29, 129, 229, 329), two beam-splitters (17, 117) as wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexers and four directional couplers (19, 119, 219, 319). In addition there are a pumped laser (25) and a light-splitter (27) connected downstream of the latter. The pumped laser (25) pumps all fibre amplifiers (21, 121, 23, 123) at the same time and in common via the light-splitter (27) and the waveguides (28, 128, 228, 328). The first fibre amplifiers (21, 121) are doped with neodymium and amplify light of 1.3  mu m, the other fibre amplifiers (23, 123) are doped with erbium for the amplification of 1.5  mu m light.
