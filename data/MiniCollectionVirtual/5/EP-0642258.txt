<ABSTRACT>
A frequency-modulation halftone image and method that enable the 
use of relatively large frequency-modulation halftone dots, which 

have desirable reprographic characteristics, in combination with 
high resolution rendering of text, graphics, and boundary 

information in general. 
In one embodiment each elemental threshold value (932) is replicated 

twice in each dimension, which causes the halftone dots to have a size 
that is twice as large as the recorder pitch.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many reproduction methods are only capable of reproducing a 
small number of stable image tones. For examples, offset printing 
is only capable of printing two stable tone values i.e. deposit ink 
or not. In order to reproduce images having continuous tones, a 
halftoning or screening technique is used. In the graphic arts 
environment, halftoning techniques convert density values of tints 
and images into a geometric distribution of binary dots that can be 
printed. The eye is not able to see the individual halftone dots, 
and only sees the corresponding "spatially integrated" density 
value. In a more general context, halftoning techniques can be seen 
as methods to convert "low spatial, high tonal resolution 
information" into an equivalent of "high spatial, low tonal 
resolution information". (The qualifiers "low" and "high" have to 
be seen on a relative scale in this context). Two main classes of halftoning techniques have been described 
for use in the graphic arts field. These two techniques are known 
as "amplitude modulation" and "frequency modulation" screening. In 
amplitude modulation screening the halftone dots, that together give 
the impression of a particular tone, are arranged on a fixed 
geometric grid. By varying the size of the halftone dots, the 
different tones of images can be simulated. Consequently, this 
technique can also be called "dot-size modulation screening". In 
frequency modulation screening the distance between the halftone 
dots is modulated rather then their size, and can also be referred 
to as "dot-position modulation screening". This technique, although 
well known in the field of low resolution plain paper printers, has 
not obtained much attention for offset printing and other high end 
printing methods, probably because of the disadvantages to be 
discussed below. Both classes of halftoning techniques are used in combination 
with a digital film recorder. A typical digital film recorder 
employs a scanning laser beam that exposes a photosensitive material 
at high resolution. The "grid" that defines the resolution at which 
the laser beam can be switched on or off, usually has an element 
size in the range of 1/1800 of an inch, 1 inch = 2,54 cm. The photosensitive material 
can be a photographic film from which a printing plate is later 
prepared by means of photomechanical techniques. The smallest  
 
addressable unit on a recorder is often called a "micro dot", 
"recorder element", or "rel". Its size is referred to as the 
recorder "pitch". As illustrated in

A method for producing a frequency-modulation halftone image 
(906) comprising the following steps : 


[A] establishing continuous tone (contone) data values (904) of 

a contone image (902) at a single specific resolution 
; 
[B] generating threshold values (932) ; 
[D] comparing (960) each of the contone data values (904) in 

sequence with a corresponding accessed threshold 
value (932) ; and, 
[E] using the result (H(i,j)) of said comparison as a halftone 

data value (908) for the frequency-modulation halftone 
image (906) ; 
 
is characterised in that said threshold values (932) are 

generated in step [B] at a resolution different from said 

specific resolution, and in that it further comprises the following step:
 
[C]
 converting the 
resolution of said threshold values (932) to said specific 

resolution. 
Method according to claim 1, comprising the step of storing said 
threshold values (932), the resolution of which has been converted, in a threshold matrix (930). 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the 
step of converting the resolution of said threshold values (932) comprises the step 

of replicating (952, 954) said threshold values. 
Method according to claim 3, wherein said replicating is 
achi
eved by dividing (952, 954) an address value of an address 
counter (940) for accessing said contone data values (904) by a 

factor K, and using said divided address value (j/2, i/2) for 
accessing said generated threshold value (932). 
Method according to claim 3, wherein said replicating is 
achieved by replicating every elemental generated threshold 

value (932) K times.  
 
Method according to any of claims 4 or 5, wherein the value of K 
equals 2 (952, 954). 
Method according any of claims 3 to 6, wherein said replication 
is performed horizontally (j/2) and vertically (i/2). 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, comprising the 
step of storing said contone data values (904) in a memory store 

(902). 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, comprising the 
step of storing said halftone data value (908) in a second 

memory store (906). 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said 
single specific resolution is a recorder pitch of a recorder 

(920) for rendering said frequency-modulation halftone image 
(906).
