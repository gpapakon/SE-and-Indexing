<ABSTRACT>
The method for classifying vehicles which are passing a predetermined point on the road, for the purpose of a refined possibility of classification within defined vehicle categories, such as track-laying (tracked) or wheeled vehicles, working from a measuring location abreast the road the distance to the running gear (undercarriage) of the vehicle respectively passing the point on the road is continuously measured in an optically active fashion along a fixed measuring line extending through the point on the road and, in addition, the speed of the vehicle respectively passing the point on the road is measured. The spatial separation of the measured values in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle is determined from the vehicle speed and the measuring frequency, and a measurement profile of the running gear of the vehicle is drawn up by plotting the measured values with the spatial separation determined in the direction of the longitudinal axis. The measurement profile is compared for agreement either indirectly by deriving vehicle parameters such as number of axles, wheelbase and wheel diameter or directly with a multiplicity of known reference vehicles. The vehicle is classified as that reference vehicle for which the agreement is closest.

Method of classifying vehicles passing a predetermined
point on the road, in which the vehicle (11) respectively

passing the point on the road is actively optically
surveyed at the point on the road from abreast of the road,

and a measurement profile of the vehicle (11) is generated,
which is compared indirectly by derivation of parameters or

directly with a plurality of known reference vehicles,
characterised in that the optical surveying of the vehicle

(11) is performed by means of a continuous optical distance
measurement along a fixed measurement line (14), which runs

through the point on the road on a level with the chassis
of the vehicle (11), of a single measurement location (13)

located abreast of the road (10), that the speed (v) of the
respective vehicle (11) passing the point on the road is

measured, and from the vehicle speed (v) and the
measurement frequency (F) the spatial distance (L) between

the measured values is determined in the longitudinal axis
of the vehicle, and that by aligning the measured values

predetermined by the distances (L) in the direction of the
longitudinal axis of the vehicle, a measurement profile of

the chassis of the vehicle (11) is drawn up.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that for
derivation of chassis parameters such as number of vehicle

wheels, distance between axles, diameter of the vehicle
wheels and suchlike, cut lengths (I) are defined in the

measurement profile by addition of the measured value
distances (Î”L) of consecutive measured values with

approximately equal measured value magnitude and the
position of the individual cut lengths (I) is determined.
Method according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
vehicle parameter "wheel diameter (R)" is calculated from

the cut length (I) according to the equation 

R = D + 
I
2
4D

wherein D is the distance of the measurement line (14) from
the road surface, and that the vehicle parameter "wheel

diameter (R)" is only permitted when

D/2 
<
 R 
<
 3 m.
Method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
vehicle parameter "wheel distances" is determined from the

cut lengths (I) permitted as vehicle parameter "wheel
diameter (R)" and their relative position in the

measurement profile.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in
that the derived chassis parameters are compared with a

plurality of like chassis parameters of known reference
vehicles, and that the vehicle (11) respectively passing

the point on the road is identified as the reference
vehicle whose chassis parameters exhibit the smallest

deviations in total from the chassis parameters derived
from the measurement profile.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
plurality of artificial chassis profiles (reference

profiles) belonging to one respective vehicle is generated
from the chassis parameters of the plurality of known

reference vehicles, including the measurement height (D) of
the measurement line (14), that the measurement profile is

correlated with the plurality of reference profiles, and
that the vehicle (11) respectively passing the point on the

road is identified as the reference vehicle, whose 
reference profile correlated with the measurement profile

provides the highest correlation factor.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the measurement line (14) is oriented essentially

horizontally and at right angles to the direction of travel
(12) of the vehicle (11).
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that the
distance (D) of the measurement line (14) from the road

surface is kept as small as possible, typically amounting
to about 20 cm.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that a laser range finder known per se, preferably an

infrared laser range finder, with a laser transmitter,
which transmits a finely focussed lig
ht beam, a receiver,
which receives reflected light, and an evaluation unit,

which calculates the distance, is used for the optically
active distance measurement.
Method according to Claim 9, characterised in that the
light transmitted by the laser transmitter and the

reflected light absorbed by the receiver is emitted and
absorbed respectively via an optical unit installed on the

road edge at measurement height (D) with an exit and
entrance pupil, which is connected to the laser transmitter

and receiver via at least one light guide.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that the vehicles (11) are detected at a distance in front

of the point on the road and the distance measurement is
activated with the detection signal.
