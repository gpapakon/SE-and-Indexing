<ABSTRACT>
A system and method are described for transferring excess air from the compressor (3) of a combustion gas-turbine (1, 2) having a paired compressor (3) and expander (4), to at least one separate combustor (17) where it is mixed with fuel and burned to power at least one non-paired expander (16). In a preferred embodiment, the non-paired expander (16) is an ''off the shelf'' unit which can be readily purchased and installed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
combustion gas turbines. Combustion gas turbines are well-known devices 
for powering electrical generators and other equipment. 
Combustion gas turbines typically have at least one 
compressor, one expander and at least one combustor. In 
the compressor, air is pressurised to mix with a fuel for 
burning. The air/fuel mixture is then burned in the 
combustor, and the hot flue gas from the combustor is used 
to drive the expander. DE-A-732 981 discloses a system which includes 
one compressor but two turbines and combustion chambers. 
One turbine is always run at the same speed and, is used 
to power the compressor, the other turbine which drives a 
generator receives varying amounts of fuel depending on 
its load. A range of fuels have been used in combustion 
gas turbines, including high and low caloric value fuels. 
High caloric value fuels are defined for purposes of this 
disclosure as fuel having a heating value of around 46520-53498 
KJ/Kg (20000-23000 BTUs per pound). High caloric 
value fuels include natural gas, which has a caloric value 
of approximately 53498 KJ/Kg (23000 BTUs per pound). Low 
caloric value fuels are defined for purposes of this 
disclosure as fuels having a heating value of about 9304 
KJ/Kg (4000 BTUs per pound) or less. Low caloric value 
fuels include coke oven gas, coal gas, reformed petroleum 
product gas and blast furnace gas, the latter typically 
having a caloric value of approximately 2675 KJ/Kg (1150 
BTUs per pound). When burned without excess air, high caloric 
value fuels can burn at about 2200째C (4000째F).  
 Temperatures of that order of magnitude, however, are too 
high for the materials used in today's expanders and would 
damage the expander. To overcome this problem, combustion 
gas turbines designed for use with high caloric value 
fuels typically employ excess compressed air to cool and 
avoid damage and/or destruction to the expander. In 
contrast, low caloric value fuels burn at only about 
1093째C (2000째F). This falls within the temperature 
constraints of materials used in modern expanders, and 
excess compressed air is not required. Under certain circumstances, it may be desirable 
to use a low caloric value fuel in a combustion gas 
turbine designed for high caloric value fuels. For 
example, price or availability differences among different 
fuel, or stricter atmospheric pollution standards may 
favour use of a low caloric value fuel. One of the 
problems caused by using low caloric value fuel in a
