<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mode control 
for controlling a helicopter flight control system 
between a turn coordination mode and a heading hold 
mode, and more particularly to improvements in a mode 
control for switching between helicopter flight 
control system modes according to switching patterns 
resembling the natural response of an expert pilot to 
flight conditions. Helicopters are typically maneuvered by the 
manipulation of various flight controls, e.g., a 
cyclic stick, a collective stick, yaw pedals, a force 
feel actuator, etc., that affect a main rotor blade 
cyclic pitch and collective pitch and a tail rotor 
blade collective pitch. The pitch of the main and 
tail rotors is also affected by an automatic flight 
control system (AFCS). Among other functions, the 
AFCS provides a heading hold mode which operates to 
maintain heading and attitude of a helicopter. 
Typically, a desired heading and/or attitude is 
achieved by manual control and then an autopilot is 
engaged. A signal from an input sensor, e.g., gyro, 
is used to provide a reference signal, indicative of 
the attitude or heading signal at the moment that the  
 
autopilot is turned on. Heading and attitude are then 
maintained based on error signals indicative of the 
difference between the reference signal and the 
current gyro output. The AFCS also provides a turn coordination mode 
which operates in conjunction with the heading hold 
mode. A normal helicopter turn is made by rolling the 
aircraft in the direction of the desired turn by 
providing a roll input via the cyclic stick (or force 
feel actuator), and introducing sufficient yaw so as 
to coordinate the turn. A coordinated turn for a 
helicopter is defined as a banked turn where the body 
of the helicopter is tangential to a curvilinear 
flight path and net acceleration is normal to the 
floor of the aircraft, e.g., no side-slip vectors. 
The more recent fly-by-wire control systems, see e.g., 
U.S. patents 4,003,532, 4,067,517, 4,206,891 and 
4,484,283, all assigned to the assignee of the present 
invention, automatically provide a yaw input to match 
the amount of roll input provided via the cyclic 
stick. The AFCS commands a coordinating yaw input 
based on the sensed rate of a yaw rate gyro. The 
coordinating yaw signal is then used to modify the 
main and tail rotor command signals as necessary to 
drive the helicopter's lateral acceleration to zero. When the autopilot is engaged, the AFCS typically 
uses a plurality of parameters, e.g., bank angle, roll
