<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a monitoring device (CM) for producing a current signal having a voltage which represents a measure for the instantaneous AC current in an induction heating coil (30) which is connected to an AC supply (12,14) by means of two parallel input lines (32,34) which are arranged at a small distance from each other and which are separate from each other by a narrow gap (36) or flux passage through which a flux (F) flows which is generated by the alternating current in the lines (32,34). According to the invention, the monitoring device has a sensing winding (100) with a plurality of turns, which is fastened by means of fastening means (362,372) between the two parallel lines and above the flux passage, the flow flowing through the flux passage intersecting the turns of the sensing winding (100) and passing through it. The monitoring device (CM) has in addition a facility for generating the current signal as a result of the voltage induced in the sensing winding.
