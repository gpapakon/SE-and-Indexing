<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control device for a plurality of loads combined in groups, in particular for lighting appliances which are to be actuated in groups by means of an operating element. It further relates to a method for activating the loads which are combined in groups. Corresponding to the device according to the invention, each of the operating elements (20-1 - 20-4) of the control device is connected to a control transmitter (10). The control transmitter (10) transmits group addresses characterising a specific group of loads, to be activated, via a control line (2) to control receivers (40-1 - 42-2) which are connected to one load (50-1 - 52-2) each. During a commissioning phase, group addresses are stored, according to a commissioning method, in the control receivers (40-1 - 42-2), and each load (50-1 - 52-2) connected to a control receiver is activated only if the group address stored in the respective control receiver during the commissioning phase matches the group address transmitted during the operating phase. The method according to the invention for commissioning the control device is essentially based on the idea of connecting the loads, to be connected, in groups to assigned control receivers (40-1 - 42-2) and of subsequently actuating an operating element (20-1 - 20-4) which is to be assigned, whereupon a corresponding group address is stored in the control receivers (40-1 - 42-2).

A process for triggering consumers (50-1 - 52-2)
combined in groups as a function of the actuation of an

operating element (20-1 - 20-4) provided for each consumer
group (50 - 52), characterised in that during a

(50) are in each case connected to first control

receivers (40-1 - 40-3),
a first group address indicating the assignment of the
first consumer group (50) to a first operating element

(20-1) is stored in the first control receivers (40-1
- 40-3) as a result of an actuation of the first

operating element (20-1) if it is detected by a
connection-checking device (63) that the consumers of

the first consumer group (50) are connected to the
first control receivers (40-1 - 40-3),

(51) are in each case connected to second control

receivers (41-1 - 41-4),

that during an operating phase

   due to an actuation of a specified operating element
