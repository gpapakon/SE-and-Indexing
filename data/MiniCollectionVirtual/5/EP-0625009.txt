<DESCRIPTION>
 Reduced calorie fatsThe present invention relates to reduced calorie fats, in particular triglyceride materials containing long chain fatty acids, preferably in combination with medium chain fatty acids. In particular the present invention relates to the use of triglyceride materials containing long chain fatty acids in food-products, especially confectionery products.Triglyceride fats made with long chain fatty acids are reduced in calories, because the long chain fatty acids are poorly digested by the body.Several documents describe the use of long chain fatty acids in triglycerides for obtaining a calorie reduction:WO 91/09537 (P&G) relates to fat and sugar containing food products, wherein the sugar contains a 5-C-hydroxymethyl hexose or derivative thereof and the fat contains a triglyceride with medium long fatty acid chains and long fatty acid chains. Preferred exemplified medium chain fatty acids are mixtures of C8 and C10 fatty acids, the preferred exemplified long chain fatty acid is Behenic acid.WO 91/09099 (P&G) describes a process for selectively making triglycerides comprising two medium chain fatty acids and one long chain fatty acid, wherein a monoglyceride of a C18_2 fatty acid is reacted with a C8_10 fatty acid at a temperature of 140 to 250°C in the absence of a catalyst under the continuous removal of water. The preferred exemplified long chain fatty acid is Behenic acid, preferred medium chain fatty acids are mixtures of C8 and C -ιηo-WO 91/09098 (P&G) describes a process for selectively making triglycerides comprising two medium chain fatty 

acids and one long chain fatty acid, wherein a monoglyceride of a C18_2 fatty acid is reacted with a C8_10 anhydride at a temperature of 90 to 190°C in the absence of a catalyst. The preferred exemplified long chain fatty acid is Behenic acid, preferred medium chain fatty acids are mixtures of C8 and C10.US 5,023,106 (P&G) describes a flavoured confectionery product comprising triglycerides with medium and long chain saturated fatty acids, wherein the medium chain fatty acid material is a mixture of Caprylic and Capric acid in a ratio of 4 to 1 to 1 to 4 and the long chain saturated fatty acid is behenic acid. Also described is a process for preparing a flavoured confectionery product containing these materials. Similar confectionery products and processes for producing these are describes in US 4,888,196 (P&G) and EP 390 408.US 4,863,753 (P&G) discloses a reduced calorie peanut butter comprising a dispersion of finely divided peanut particles
