<ABSTRACT>
A laminar microstrip patch antenna (23) comprises a ground 
plane element (21) located between a patch radiator and a 

transmission line circuit for feeding the antenna. The ground 
plane has a cross aperture (24) formed by two intersecting 

linear slots and the transmission line circuit has two linear 
conductors (27,28) intersecting each other in alignment with 

the centre of the cross aperture and the two linear conductors 
are electrically insulated from each other at the point of 

intersection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a patch antenna assembly and 
particularly to such an assembly suitable for use in a 
vehicle glazing panel. Aperture coupled patch antennae are known for use in 
receiving and transmitting high frequency signals such as 
microwave signals. These are particularly suitable for 
mobile satellite communications and are applicable to 
communication systems in mobile vehicles. An example of 
such a patch antenna is shown in US Patent No 5043738. That 
specification illustrates an aperture coupled antenna and 
systems of this type are particularly applicable to use on a 
vehicle glazing panel as it may avoid obtrusive protrusions 
outside the glass surface. No electrically conducting 
connections are required through the glass of the glazing 
panel and in a preferred arrangement the patch antenna is 
arranged to cause only minor signal strength degradation 
with rain drops or water on the outside of the vehicle 
surface. Such systems may be used to transmit or receive 
plane polarised radiation or in some cases circular 
polarisation may be preferred. Circular polarisation is 
particularly suited to vehicle communication systems in that 
they are less sensitive to vehicle direction. Various 
proposals have been made for apertures and feed lines used 
in such coupling systems. In US Patent No 5043738 there is 
described a system in which two separated apertures are 
provided in a ground plane so as to provide coupling between 
transmission feed circuit members and a radiating patch. To 
obtain circular polarisation that specification uses two 
laterally separated feed members having their end regions 
directed at right angles to each other so that each 
intersects the line of its respective aperture in the ground 
plane. However such a system requiring laterally spaced 
feed conductors with apertures forming separated arms of an 
L shaped configuration does not provide either symmetrical  
 
or strong coupling through the aperture to the radiating patch. When used in a vehicle glazing panel it is of course necessary 
that the dielectric layer between the ground plane and a 
radiating patch will be formed of glass and this will have a 
thickness determined by the particular glazing requirements of 
the vehicle. Due to the high dielectric constant of glass and 
the relatively large separation between the ground plane and 
the radiating patch which will result from using typical 
thickness of toughened automotive glass, it is important to 
achieve an effective coupling through the

A laminar microstrip patch antenna comprising a ground 
plane element having opposing first and second faces, a first 

dielectric planar member adjacent a first face of the ground 
plane element, a patch radiator on a face of the first 

dielectric member remote from said ground element, a second 
dielectric planar member adjacent a second face of the ground 

plane element, and a transmission line circuit for feeding the 
antenna which circuit is located on a face of the second 

dielectric member remote from said ground plane element, said 
ground plane having an aperture to couple the transmission 

line circuit to the patch radiator, which aperture comprises a 
cross formed by two linear slots intersecting each other, and

conductors intersecting each other so that one extends across 

the other but electrically insulated from each other at the 
point of intersection, the intersection of said linear

slots of the aperture. 
An antenna according to claim 1 in which each linear 
conductor has an open circuit projection beyond a slot of said 

aperture providing an effective short circuit to said ground 
plane element, the insulation between said linear conductors 

thereby resulting in isolated current paths in said linear 
conductors each of which crosses the aperture and leads only 

to the projection of the respective linear conductor in one 
quadrant of said cross.

is a quarter wavelength projection.

which the slots extend orthogonally relative to each other. 
An antenna according to any one of the preceding claims, 
in which the direction of each linear conductor is arranged to 

lie centrally between a pair of slots in the aperture so as to 
form symmetrical alignment between the intersecting conductors 

and the aperture cross.

other.

in which the linear conductors each have a reduced width in 

the region of their intersection. 
An antenna according to claim 8, in which each of the 
linear conductors has a tapered change in width on one side of 

the point of intersection, thereby forming a flared section
