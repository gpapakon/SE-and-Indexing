<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zirconia
diaphragm structure, a method of producing the same, and a
piezoelectric/electrostrictive film element including the
zirconia diaphragm structure. In particular, the invention
is concerned with such a diaphragm structure having a thin
zirconia diaphragm that is free of buckling, cracks and
other defects, and a method of producing the diaphragm
structure, and is also concerned with a high-quality
piezoelectric/electrostrictive film element including such a
zirconia diaphragm structure.A diaphragm structure having a substrate or base
with at least one window or opening formed therethrough, and
a thin diaphragm plate formed of a flexible material so as
to close the window or windows, has been widely used for
various kinds of sensors. In recent years, this diaphragm
structure has been increasingly used for
piezoelectric/electrostrictive actuators. When the diaphragm
structure is used as a component of a sensor, the sensor has
appropriate means for detecting the amount of bending or 
flexural displacement of a diaphragm of the diaphragm
structure, which displacement is caused by an object (e.g.,
voltage) to be measured by the sensor. When the diaphragm
structure is used as a component of a piezoelectric/electrostrictive
actuator, the diaphragm of the diaphragm
structure is deformed or deflected by a piezoelectric/electrostrictive
element formed on the diaphragm. For
example, the actuator utilizes a change in the pressure in a
pressure chamber formed within the diaphragm structure.The diaphragm structure as described above may be
produced by forming an integral body consisting of the
substrate serving as a base or support, and a film member
which is supported by the substrate and which provides the
diaphragm. For improved operating reliability, and increased
heat resistance and corrosion resistance, the diaphragm
structure is desirably formed as a fired integral ceramic
body, as proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,894,635 (corresponding
to JP-A-63-292032) owned by the assignee of the present
application, and co-pending European Patent Application No.
92306517.1 (corresponding to JP-A-5-29675) assigned to the
present assignee. These documents disclose a
piezoelectric/electrostrictive film element in the form of a
fired integral body of a ceramic material, which is used for
a pressure sensor and a piezoelectric/electrostrictive
actuator.The integral ceramic diaphragm structure as
described above is generally formed by laminating a ceramic 
green substrate having a window with
