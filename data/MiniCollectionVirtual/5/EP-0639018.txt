<ABSTRACT>
Time sensitive messages are sent from a sending station device (4) to a 
receiving station device (6). The messages are sent during calling party defined send 

windows. The messages include read windows that restrict the called party's access 
to the message after delivery to the receiving station. If a message is not delivered 

during the send window, or if a message is not read during the read window, the 
calling party may specify that an alternate message should be delivered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communications; and more specifically, 
to time sensitive communications. The cost of distributing information to large numbers of people in 
widely-dispersed areas is reduced by transmitting the information during a 
communication discount period. Unfortunately, the discount period may not 
correspond to the time at which it is desirable to release time-sensitive information 
such as new pricing information. Therefore, there is a need for a system to distribute 
information to a called party's terminal or station while preventing the called party 
from accessing the information before a predetermined time. U.S. patent 4,939,771 entitled "Attendant-Controlled Call Message 
Delivery System and Method" discusses sending a message to a messaging operation 
center with a specified delivery window. An attendant or appropriate circuitry then 
attempts to deliver the message to the specified party within the specified delivery 
window. This system enables a user to control the delivery window and thereby take 
advantage of a communication discount period; however, it does not provide control 
over the called party's access to the message after delivery. Time-sensitive messaging provides independent control over a 
message's delivery window and the time at which the called party may access the 
message by sending a message to a called station and storing the message in the 
called station while controlling a called party's access to the message. The called 
party's access to the message is controlled by specifying a time window during 
which the called party may have access to the message. This permits distributing 
time-sensitive information such as pricing information, during a discount 
communication period while preventing access to the new prices until a later time 
that may be outside of the discount communication period. FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a sending station device and a 
receiving station device connected by a communication link; FIG. 2 is a table used by the sending station device;  FIG. 3 is a flow chart of a program carried out by the sending station's 
microprocessor; FIG. 4 is a flow chart of a receive interrupt routine executed by the 
sending station device; FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a user interface interrupt carried out by the 
sending station device; FIG. 6 is a table used by the receiving station device; FIG. 7 is a flow chart of a program carried out by the receiving station 
device; and FIG. 8 is a flow chart of a receive interrupt routine
