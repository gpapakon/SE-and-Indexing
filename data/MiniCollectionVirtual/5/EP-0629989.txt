<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microdots and, more 
particularly, to a novel, composite microdot and method 
wherein different types of layers are selectively affixed 
to the microdot to provide the microdot with various, 
preselected features such as enhanced visibility, 
camouflage, magnetic attraction, controlled buoyancy, and 
controlled biodegradation, to name several. Microdots, as the name implies, are small, usually 
less than about two millimetres in diameter, discs cut from 
a plastic substrate. Each microdot is configured to carry 
a unique identification feature such as a preselected 
colour or a specific serial number to enable the subsequent 
finder of the microdot to identify the origin of the 
microdot. In one application, the microdot is imprinted 
with a specific serial number and is accompanied by several 
hundred or even thousands of identical microdots. These  
 
microdots are then placed discretely and even openly at 
numerous locations on various items of personal property on 
the premise that one or more of these microdots will be 
subsequently retrieved and thereby reveal the correct 
ownership of the item of personal property. The Principle 
concept is that it is virtually impossible for a miscreant 
to remove all the microdots from the item. Further, some 
microdot systems are designed to allow a portion of the 
microdots to be dislodged during transit to thereby leave 
a trail of microdots which provide credible evidence as to 
the prior locations of the item, thus aiding in the 
apprehension of the miscreant and any cohorts. Several microdot technologies are known in the art. 
Perhaps one of the earliest references in this field is 
that of Dillon (U.S. Patent No. 4,243,734 which discloses 
a microdot configured as a square having a side dimension 
in the nature of 0.007 inch. Each microdot includes the 
indicia of the particular owner. Another identification system that uses a plurality of 
small labels, not microdots, per se, is that of Krietemeier 
et al (U.S. Patent No. 4,763,928). This disclosure relates 
to small tags which are cut from a strip of plastic but 
releasably held on a substrate to allow the person applying 
the tags to individually retrieve a tag from the plastic 
strip and mount it to the item. From the foregoing it is clear that various attempts 
have been made to provide a microdot identification system 
for an item of personal property. However, there are  
 
numerous instances where it would be desirable to have a 
microdot that could be used not only to
