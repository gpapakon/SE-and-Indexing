<ABSTRACT>
The subassembly, constituted by assembling a body and a cover (2), internally defines gas conduit portions (II) bounded by partitions of the body cooperating with sealing strips (12) in grooves (11) in the cover (2) and formed and mounted in these grooves by moulding/injection. The sealing strips (12) are formed set-back in the grooves (11) and cooperate with ends of the partitions of the body which extend partially into the grooves (11). Application in particular to anaesthesia apparatus.

<CLAIMS>
Subassembly of a network of gas ducts for an
apparatus for supplying gas to the respiratory tract of

a user, comprising a body (1) which, with a lid (2)
attached to the body, defines at least two portions of

gas ducts (I, E) delimited laterally by partitions (10)
of the body, characterized in that these partitions

collaborate with sealing ribs (12) formed and mounted
by moulding/injection moulding in housings (11) in the

lid, at least the bottom of each housing being
completely occupied by a continuous sealing rib.
Subassembly according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the sealing ribs (12) are formed set back in

the housings (11) and collaborate with projecting parts
of the partitions (10) extending partially into the

housings (11) when the subassembly is in the assembled
configuration.
Subassembly according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the partitions (10) have a roughly trapezoidal

cross section.
Subassembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the cover (2) has a

roughly flat configuration.
Subassembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the body (1) has a

parallelepipedal overall configuration.
Subassembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least the body (1) is

made of a moulded thermoplastics material. 
Subassembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises means (4, 5)

for connecting the portions of gas ducts (I, E) to at
least one external gas circuit (R; S; T).
Subassembly according to one of the preceding
claims, for an anaesthesia apparatus, characterized in

that it defines portions (I, E) of the inhalation and
exhalation branches of a patient circuit.
Subassembly according to Claim 8, characterized
in that each branch portion (I, E) comprises a

non-return valve (C
i
, C
e
) mounted in the cover (2).
Anaesthesia apparatus comprising a removable
subassembly according to one of Claims 1 to 9.
