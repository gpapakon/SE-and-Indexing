<ABSTRACT>
A cast iron slide member with a slide surface which 
is formed from cast iron comprising 3.0 % to 3.6 % by 

weight of carbon, 1.6 % to 2.4 % by weight of silicon, 
0.2 % to 1.5 % by weight of manganese, 0.5 % to 1.5 % by 

weight of chromium, 1.0 % to 3.0 % by weight of nickel, 
0.5 % to 1.0 % by weight of molybdenum, 0.0003 % to 0.1 

% by weight of at least one chilling promoting element E
L
 
selected from the group consisting of bismuth, tellurium 

and cerium, and the balance of iron (Fe) and unavoidable 
impurities. With this alloy, it is possible to improve 

the scuffing and pitting resistance of the slide 
portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cast iron slide
member, and particularly to a slide member for use under
a high surface pressure.A cast iron cam shaft for an internal combustion
engine is a conventional example of such a slide member.
The entire outer peripheral area on the camshaft can be
a slide portion, or a half of the outer peripheral area,
including a nose portion, can be the slide portion. In
either case, the entire slide portion of this structure
is chilled during production.When such a cam shaft is used under a high surface
pressure, pitting and scuffing resistance of the nose
portion becomes a problem.The pitting and scuffing resistance of such a
sliding portion can be improved if the chilled structure
of the nose portion has a uniform fine structure having
a large amount of precipitated free cementite. However,
such a structure has a high hardness and the hardness of
the base structure is not reduced by strain relief
annealing (conducted at a thermal treating temperature
of 600°C after casting).SU-A-1687641 discloses a slide member (rolling
roll) having a slide portion comprising from 3 to 6 wt%
C, Si, 0.2-1.5 wt% Mn, 0.5 to 1.5 wt% Cr, Ni, 0.0003 to
0.1 wt% of one or more chilling promoting elements and
the balance substantially of iron.The present invention provides a slide member, for
example of the type described above, which has a slide
portion, wherein the above described requirements can be
satisfied by forming the cam shaft from a particular
alloy composition.Viewed from one aspect, the present invention
provides a slide member having a slide portion (chilled
in its preparation) which is formed from a cast iron 
composition comprising: 3.0% (inclusive) to 3.6%
(inclusive) by weight of carbon (C), 1.6% (inclusive) to
2.4% (inclusive) by weight of silicon (Si), 0.2%
(inclusive) to 1.5% (inclusive) by weight of manganese 
(Mn), 0.5 % (inclusive) to 1.0 % (inclusive) by weight
of chromium (Cr), 1.5 % (inclusive) to 3.0 % (inclusive)
by weight of nickel (Ni), 0.5 % (inclusive) to 1.0 %
(inclusive) by weight of molybdenum (Mo), 0.0003 %
(inclusive) to 0.1 % (inclusive) by weight of at least
one chilling promoting element EL selected from the group
consisting of bismuth (Bi), tellurium (Te) and cerium
(Ce), and the balance of iron (Fe) and unavoidable
impurities.If the composition of the slide member is
maintained in the above specified manner, the chilled
structure of the slide portion has a uniform fine
structure having a large amount of precipitated
cementite which has a high hardness.
