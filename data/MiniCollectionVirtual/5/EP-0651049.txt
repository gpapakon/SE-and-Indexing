<ABSTRACT>
Herein is disclosed a nonionic aqueous 
dishwashing liquid that has good foaming capability and 

antibacterial action. The liquid contains: 


a) 0.5 to 15, preferably 2, weight percent 
of a quaternary disinfecting compound; 
b) 0.5 to 20, preferably 13-14, weight 
percent of a C₁₂-C₁₃ alcohol ethoxylate nonionic 

surfactant; 
c) 0.0 to 20, preferably 3-5, weight percent 
of a C₁₃- C₁₅ alcohol ethoxylate nonionic surfactant; 
d) 0.5 to 20.0, preferably 2, weight percent 
of a nonionic surfactant selected from the group 

consisting of cocomonoethanolamide or 
cocodiethanolamide or combinations thereof; 
e) 0.5 to 12, preferably 4-5, weight percent 
cocoamidopropyl betaine nonionic surfactant; 
f) 0 to 2.0, preferably 1, weight percent of 
the sodium salts of EDTA.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to formulations for 
manually washing dishes. Light-duty liquid detergent formulations for 
kitchen surfaces are well known. Kitchen surfaces 
include counter tops, stove tops, dishes and any other 
hard surface commonly found in kitchen environments. 
The term "dishes" includes any utensils involved in 
food preparation or consumption. Kitchen surfaces, 
particularly dishes, must be washed free of food 
residues, grease, proteins, starches, gums, dyes, oils 
and burnt organic residues. Most of the consumer accepted formulations in 
use include anionic synthetic surfactants with or 
without a nonionic surfactant. Many of such 
formulations contain a sulphonate-type anionic 
surfactant, for example, an alkylbenzene sulphonate or 
an alkane sulfonate, in conjunction with a sulphate or 
alkyl ether sulphate, or a nonionic surfactant, for 
example, an alcohol ethoxylate, an alkyl phenol 
ethoxylate, a mono- or diethanolamide or an amine 
oxide. The sulphonate material generally predominates. It is the anionic surfactant that provides 
the typical high foaming (suds) characteristics 
generally associated with dish washing formulations. 
Foam (suds) is the cleaning efficacy signal relied on 
by consumers. Nonionic surfactants generally do not 
provide good foaming characteristics. It is known from US-A-2,746,928 that it is 
not possible to mix anionic surface-active agents with 
quaternary ammonium germicides. The cationic 
quaternary ammonium germicide reacts with the anionic 
surface-active agent resulting in a reduction in 
germicidal and detergent activity. Thus anionic surfactants are incompatible 
with cationic quaternary antimicrobial surfactants and 
nonionic surfactants do not normally provide 
significant foaming capability to liquid formulations.  
 
Therefore current dish washing formulations can only 
mechanically eliminate bacteria from kitchen hard 
surfaces. They are not effective in killing or 
controlling the spread of germs throughout the kitchen 
environment. Thus dish washing liquids combining good 
foaming and antimicrobial activities are not available 
to the consumer. The present invention provides an aqueous 
disinfecting liquid formulation for cleaning hard 
surfaces, particularly dishes, in a kitchen 
environment; wherein said formulation is free of 
anionic surfactants and consisting essentially of: 
a) 0.5 to 15 weight percent of a quaternary 
disinfecting compound; b) 0.5 to 20, preferably 13 to 14, weight 
percent of a C₁₂-C₁₃ alcohol ethoxylate nonionic
