<ABSTRACT>
The specification discloses an agricultural machine (2) for cutting long stemmed animal feed material such as hay and comprises a cylindrical cutting drum (4) mounted for rotation about a substantially horizontal axis (6). A plurality of cutting blades (8) project radially outwards from the circumferential surface (10) of the drum (4). The machine (2) also includes a moveable bed (14) on which, in use, lies the material to be cut. The bed (14) can turn about a horizontal pivot axis (16) adjacent the drum (4). Hydraulic cylinders (18) connected between a frame (20) of a support for the machine (2) and the bed (14) are provided to turn and hold the bed (14) at different angles about the pivot axis (16). The bed (14) includes first, second and third adjacent flat sections (22, 24 and 26) arranged in a U-like configuration. The hydraulic cylinders (18) are used to control the elevation of the bed (14) and therefore the rate of feeding of the material to be cut to the cutter drum (4). A shutter arrangement (42) is located beneath the drum cutter (4) to control the length of time that the material is in contact with the cutting blades.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AGRICULTURAL MACHINEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention concerns an agricultural machine suitable for cutting long stem animal feed material. In particular, but not exclusively, the machine may be used to cut baled hay, although it may also be used to cut sedge or any other long stemmed material.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere are many agricultural purposes to be served by cutting long stemmed material. For instance, long stemmed by-products may be cut and distributed over the soil in order to improve its organic content. Alternatively, animal feed stuffs such as straw required to be cut into short lengths before they can be comminuted in food preparation mixes.A variety of stationary and transportable mixers have been proposed, however few of these are of any practical use because of the difficulties of controlling the cutting process and transporting the material both before and after cutting. In one particular such machine described in Australian Patent No. 591155, a rotary cutter is arranged together with a feeding conveyor, and a discharge chute transversely on a trailer. A bale lifter extends from the back of the trailer. Broad flails with sharpened sides and ends are pivotally attached to the rotary cutter such that they are flung outwards as the cutter rotates and passed between a series of bars and over a further bar which acts as anvils to chop material advanced towards them on the conveyor. The broad flails generate air flow which draws the material to be chopped into the cutting region and expels the cut material along the length of the output chute. This machine has great difficulty in controlling the rate at which the material is fed to the cutter. In addition when baled material is provided the machine has difficulty in unrolling the bale, 

and the cutting action causes a tendency for the bale to be drawn over the top of the rotary cutter resulting in the need to provide an eccentrically mounted roller above the rotary cutter in order to restrain the bale and to assist in its unrolling.Summary of the InventionAccording to the present invention, as currently envisaged, there is provided an agricultural machine for cutting long stemmed animal feed materials. The machine comprises a rotary cutter means mounted for rotation about a substantially horizontal axis, and having cutting elements projecting radially outwards. Also support means are provided to feed the material to be cut to the rotary cutter, and these means comprise a bed on which, in use, lies the material to be cut.The

 THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. An agricultural machine for cutting long stem animal feed material, comprising: rotary cutter means mounted for rotation about a substantially horizontal axis and having cutting elements projecting radially outwards; and, support means to feed the material to be cut to the rotary cutter means comprising a bed on which, in use, lies the material to be cut; wherein the bed is turnable about a horizontal pivot axis adjacent the rotary cutter means, and elevating means are provided to turn and hold the bed at different angles around the pivot axis.
2. An agricultural machine according to claim 1, wherein said bed comprises three flat sections, a first adjacent said pivot axis, a second extending from the distal end of the first at an obtuse angle with respect to the first, and a third extending from the distal end of the second at an obtuse angle with respect to the second.
3. An agricultural machine according to claim 2 wherein the bed comprises a conveyor to transport material lying on it.
4. An agricultural machine according to claim 3 wherein the conveyor comprises a series of slats spaced apart and flexibly coupled together to form an endless loop which, at the end adjacent the rotary cutter travels around a rotating cylinder from which vanes extend across substantially the full width of the conveyor and which engage between adjacent slats of the conveyor.
5. An agricultural machine according to claim 4 wherein said vanes have a height substantially equal to the height of said slats. 



 6. An agricultural machine according to claim
5, wherein said vanes are interrupted by sprockets which engage the flexible coupling of said conveyor whereby, in use, said relating cylinder drives said conveyor.
7. An agricultural machine according to claim
6, further comprising scrapers situated under said bed to remove material trapped between the sprockets and the flexible coupling.
8. An agricultural machine according to claim 7 wherein the cutting element comprises blades which are twisted along their length to divert longitudinally approaching stems and cut them laterally.
9. An agricultural machine according to claim
8 further comprising grill bars located in front of said rotary cutter to space the material to be cut away from the rotary cutter except in the region adjacent the support means.
10. An agricultural machine according to claim
9 wherein cut material falls away under the rotary cutter onto a belt conveyor which transports it in a direction parallel the axis of the rotary cutter.
11. An agricultural machine according to claim 10, wherein fingers are positioned above said belt, directed downwards and against the direction of transport, to even out the flow of cut material carried by said belt.
12. An agricultural machine according to claim 11 further comprising shutters having an adjustable angle positioned under the rotary cutter immediately adjacent said support means to control the length of time said material is in contact with said cutting elements. 


 lS . An agricultural machine according to claim 12 wherein said agricultural machine is arranged longitudinally on a trailer.
14. An agricultural machine according to claim 13 further comprising a bale lifter disposed from the rear of the trailer for loading bales of material onto said bed.
