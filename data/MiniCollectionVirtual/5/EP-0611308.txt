<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a self-supporting composite bioactive material comprises immersing a body of collagen in a solution comprising a calcium phosphate and a phosphoprotein (preferably containing o-phosphoserine residues) to deposit on the collagen a mineralised layer of calcium phosphate and the phosphoprotein.

<DESCRIPTION>
A material that does not produce adverse
biological side effects when placed in the body is
termed a biomaterial, and as such is classified as
either bioinert or bioactive. Osteogenic bioactive
materials stimulate bone regrowth, and are generally
composed of natural materials. Implants of porous
hydroxyapatite1, collagen combined with gelatin2, and
hydroxyapatite immersed in a collagen gel3 have all
shown excellent bone regenerative capacity, but
unfortunately have been unable to provide the
mechanical properties for use as implants in stressed
regions. Bioinert materials, on the other hand, have
mechanical properties superior to the bioactive
materials but are not recognised by the immune system,
allowing no interaction with the living tissue causing
the implant to remain permanently within the body.Calcium phosphate may precipitate out of
aqueous solution as: dicalcium phosphate dihydrate
(Ca/P ratio 2:1); octacalcium phosphate (Ca/P ratio
1.33:1) and hydroxyapatite (Ca/P ratio 1.67:1). (An
amorphous calcium phosphate, of variable composition,
sometimes precipitates initially.) The thermodynamic
factors governing the nucleation and growth of calcium
phosphate phases on both hydroxyapatite seed crystals
and reconstituted collagen have been studied
extensively by Nancollas4,5. The involvement of kinetic
factors has been investigated by Boistelle6.Glimcher7 and Endo8 have studied the effect of
incorporating the amino acid residue o-Phosphoserine
with collagen in the solid state prior to
mineralisation and found that the lag-time occurring
before mineral precipitation, decreased on adding the
protein. The main distinctive feature of 
phosphoprotein is the presence of the residues of the
phosphoserine amino ester unit. Many other
experimenters have investigated the effect of proteins
on mineralisation. Termine9 found osteonectin to
enhance the mineralisation process and suggested that
it formed a "link" between collagen and mineral,
whereas Doi's10 experimentation deemed the same protein
to inhibit mineralisation. Similar arguments have
taken place over osteocalcin and osteopontin. Overall,
the results of the effects of proteins on
mineralisation are inconclusive due to conflicting
information.The mechanical properties of many different
types of animal bone have been tested by Currey11,
giving Young's Modulus and Ultimate Tensile Strength
(UTS) values of 2 to 50 GPa and 40 to 200 MPa
respectively. Mechanical properties of any bioactive
materials so far produced have not been extensively
tested, but those
