<ABSTRACT>
A sputter coating target which alleviates the need for 
anode reconditioning due to a buildup of a nonconductive 

coating comprises a coating component which itself or its 
reactive product is substantially electrically 

nonconductive and a dopant component which itself or its 
reactive product is substantially electrically conductive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to targets for sputter coating 
a material onto a substrate and to a method of using the 
target. More particularly, this invention relates to 
targets containing special dopant materials and to methods 
of using such targets for reducing process downtime 
required for anode reconditioning. As is well known in the fields of automotive and 
architectural glass, multi-layered coating systems play a 
vital role in providing desirable characteristics such as 
transmittance, emissivity, reflectivity, durability, color, 
and chemical resistance. Such coating systems may be 
conventionally created by the well known commercial process 
known as sputter coating whereby a variety of different 
materials including metals and non-metals in pure, oxide or 
nitride form are applied to a glass substrate. An example 
of one such layer used in coating systems is silicon 
nitride (Si₃N₄). Silicon nitride is desirable as a coating 
for glass because it is durable and forms a transparent 
protective layer. The layer or layers of silicon nitride 
may be applied by sputter coating silicon from a silicon 
cathode target in the presence of nitrogen gas. Sputter coating is an electric discharge process, 
conducted in a vacuum chamber and in the presence of one or 
more gases. The equipment employed normally includes a 
vacuum chamber, a power source, an anode, and one or more 
specially prepared cathode targets covered with the  
 
material used to create a layer in the coating system. 
This equipment is expensive, and techniques for producing 
sputter coated articles are complex, time consuming and 
must be carried out with great precision. Consequently, 
like many other industrial processes, once the process is 
started, it is desirable to allow the process to continue 
for as long a period of time as possible and to produce as 
much end product as possible. When an electric potential is applied to the cathode 
target, the background gas forms a plasma that bombards the 
target causing particles of the coating material to be 
liberated. The liberated coating material then adheres to 
the substrate and other exposed surfaces within the vacuum 
chamber, such as the chamber walls and the anode. When 
conducted in the presence of a reactive gas, a reactive 
product of the coating material is deposited on the 
substrate, i.e. the coating layer is the product of the 
coating material and the reactive gas. In commercial sputter-coating systems such as those 
produced by Airco Corporation, a cathode target
