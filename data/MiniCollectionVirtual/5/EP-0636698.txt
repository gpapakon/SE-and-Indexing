<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process, installation and container (60) for charging of scrap to a steel melting furnace, in which the scrap is preheated and the energy contained in the exhaust gases from the furnace, consisting of sensible heat and chemically bound heat in the combustible components of the exhaust gases, is used for preheating, the exhaust gas being passed to an exhaust gas combustion chamber (16) inserted in an exhaust gas outlet line (13), is burnt with air in this chamber to give combustion gas, is then fed to scrap-filled containers (60) and extracted by way of an extractor (19).

A method for using scrap in melting furnaces for 
steel production, in which the scrap is preheated and 

the energy contained in the exhaust gases of the 
furnace, which is composed of sensible heat and 

chemically bound heat in the combustible portions of 
the exhaust gases, is used for preheating, the exhaust 

gas being passed to an exhaust-gas combustion chamber 
inserted into an exhaust-gas outlet line, burned 

therein with air to form combustion gas, then being 
supplied to containers filled with scrap and being 

withdrawn via a fan, characterised by the following 
features: 


a) the combustion exhaust gases flow across a base 
designed as a grid through the containers filled 

with scrap without an interruption in time, with 
the combustion gas flowing vertically from bottom 

to top through at least two scrap containers 
connected in series and at least one scrap 

container being connected to the gas supply only 
during the transfer time, 
b) the scrap container located first in the series in 
terms of the supply of heat is separated from the 

supply of heat once the desired scrap temperature 
has been reached and is transferred into a free 

position, 
c) from this free position the heat-insulated 
container filled with hot scrap is picked up and 

transported to the melting furnace, 
d) a container filled with fresh scrap on the scrap 
yard is placed in the empty free position and from  

 
there is transferred into the empty heating-up 

position, and 
e) the container is connected to the hot combustion 
gases in series behind the container being heated 

up, and combustion gases flow therethrough 
corresponding to a). 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the combustion gases before the first contact with 

the scrap located in the container are supplied in a 
width corresponding to the container opening. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the combustion gases entering on the grid side 

flow through the scrap containers in the position in 
which they are filled with scrap. 
A steel-making apparatus with a melting furnace, 
to which an exhaust-gas combustion chamber is connected 

on the flue-gas side, with a scrap preheating station 

including a suction removal means and with containers 
in which cold scrap can be transported from the scrap 

yard to the preheating station and heated scrap can be 
transported therefrom to the melting furnace, for 

performing the method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the scrap preheating station (50) is of carousel-like 

construction, in which the scrap containers (61, 62), 
which are cylindrical and have a base formed as a grid 

(67), can be supplied to at least two heating-up 
stations (54, 55) via undercarriages (51, 52) which are 

pivotable about a central axis (I),
 
that fixed pipes (21-29) of the supply means (17) and 

removal means (18) for preheating gas open into the 
heating-up stations (54, 55), and that an additional 

station (56) is designed as a free position.  
 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the mouths of the pipes (22-25) 

have hoods (41-44), which are displaceable coaxially to 
the pipe ends and during the operating phase rest in 

gas-tight manner against the scrap containers (61, 62). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the connecting lines (26, 27) are 

arranged such that a central pipe (21) is guided 
parallel to the supply and removal means (22, 23 and 

24, 25) for the scrap containers (61, 62), which pipe 
ends at the top and bottom centrally in the connecting 

lines (26, 27), and
 
that bypass lines (28, 29) are connected to the mouths 

of these connecting lines (26, 27). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the connecting lines (26, 27) and 

the bypass lines (28, 29) have fittings (33-38) which 
permit guidance of the combustion gases in any manner 

desired. 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the undercarriages (51, 52) have 

drives (57, 58) by means of which they can be moved to 
any stations (54-56) desired, independently of one 

another. 
A steel-making apparatus according to one of the 
above Claims 4 - 8, characterised in that a measuring 

and regulating station (70) is provided which is 
connected to the fittings (31-38), the undercarriages 

(51, 52) and the hood displacement means (45-47). 
An apparatus for heating scrap for performing the 
method according to Claim 1 and for use in the steel-making 

apparatus according to Claim 4, in which the  
 

walls of the container (60, 61, 63) serving to receive 
the scrap consist of a cylindrical metal shell (64) 

covered with heat insulation (65), the one opening (66) 
of which is covered by a grid (67), the grid (67) 

consisting of high-temperature-resistant material, e.g. 
of ceramic,
 
a baffle plate (83) which can be dumped at the scrap 

yard is provided, which has a brush-like shape and the 
brush elements (84) of which correspond with the free 

surface of the grid (67), the containers (61, 62) can 
be inserted on the baffle plate (68) using their grid 

(67) and
 
the baffle plate (83) consists of an impact-absorbing 

material (85) or damping elements (86).
