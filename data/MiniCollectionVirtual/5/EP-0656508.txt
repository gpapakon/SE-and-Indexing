<ABSTRACT>
A protective wall structure (38) for protecting 
boiler tubing in facilities using refuse as a 

fuel source to produce steam for electrical power generation. The protective wall structure 
includes an array of shielding tiles (44), 

heat transfer bonding material (46), and elongated 
compressible material (48). The shielding tiles 

include a front surface (52) facing the interior 
combustion zone of the facility, a rear 

surface (54) facing the boiler tubes, and a plurality of 
sidewall surfaces. The heat transfer bonding 

material is positioned between the boiler tubes (40) 
and the rear surfaces of the shielding tiles to permit heat transfer and create a bond between 

the boiler tubes and the shielding tiles. The elongated compressible material is positioned 
between the sidewall perimeter surfaces of adjacent shielding tiles to provide an expansion 

joint. This permits relative expansion between adjacent shielding tiles without cracking upon 
an increase in temperature in the interior combustion zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protective wall structure for protecting boiler tubing 
in furnaces of steam generating units. More specifically, the present invention relates to a 
refractory tile and expansion joint arrangement used for protecting boiler tubes in facilities 
using refuse as a fuel source to produce steam for electrical power generation. Combustive products from municipal refuse can be very corrosive. During the 
operation of refuse-to-energy facilities, it is important to protect boiler tubes from corrosion. 
Corroded boiler tubes can leak which reduces the facility efficiency and frequently leads to 
the premature shut-down of the facility. Prior facilities provided arrangements to protect 
boiler tubes, however, these arrangements have been costly and have not been proven to be 
effective in protecting boiler tubes over prolonged periods of time. The need to provide environmentally correct and cost effective solutions for the refuse 
generated in the Unites States became apparent in the late 1960's. At that time, refuse 
disposal was mainly by land filling and to a lesser extent incineration. That situation changed 
as landfill space became recognized as a finite resource and that refuse could be used as a 
fuel source which could displace other, more costly, fuel sources in the generation of process 
steam and electricity. Refuse-to-energy plants became a common source of energy. A common refuse-to-energy facility, generally indicated by reference numeral 2, is 
shown in Figures 1-3. In operation, a crane or a front end loader (not shown) picks up a 
quantity of refuse from a refuse storage area and deposits it into charging hopper 4. 
Charging hopper 4 has a large plan area to facilitate this operation and acts as a funnel to 
feed the refuse to feed chute 6. Refuse travels down feed chute 6 by gravity until it reaches 
ram table 8 at the bottom of feed chute 6. Ram feeder 10 pushes refuse from ram table 8 
horizontally onto reciprocating grates 12 for incineration in combustion zone 14 of furnace 
16. As depicted in Figure 2, combustion zone 14 or the lower furnace environment is  
 
bounded by furnace walls 18 which include a plurality of horizontally spaced boiler tubes 20 
and tube joining members or membranes 22 which structurally join adjacent boiler tubes 20 
to one another. Boiler tubes 20 carry cooling water to recover the heat given off from the 
burning of refuse in combustion zone 14. As previously described, boiler tubes 20 are subject to corrosion due to the
