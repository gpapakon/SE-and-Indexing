<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved heat
generating resistor comprising a specific tantalum nitride
containing TaN0.8 which excels not only in terms of heat
generation performance but also in terms of durability upon
repeated use and which can be produced at a reduced
production cost. The heat generating resistor is applicable
to various outputting mechanism-bearing devices or systems
such as printers, facsimiles, copying machines, and
composite mechanized retrieval systems, and also to their
terminal printers of printing an object output on a
printing medium. Particularly, the heat generating resistor
is suitable for use particularly in a liquid jet system of
discharging and flying printing liquid utilizing a thermal
energy to thereby print an image on a medium such as
ordinary paper, synthetic paper, fabric, or the like. The 
present invention includes an improved substrate provided
with said heat generating resistor for a liquid jet head, a
liquid jet head provided with said substrate, and a liquid
jet apparatus provided with said liquid jet head. The
present invention enables to produce any of said substrate,
liquid jet head, and liquid jet apparatus respectively at
an improved precision and at a reduced production cost.U.S. Pat. No. 3,242,006 (hereinafter referred to as
Literature 1) discloses a tantalum nitride (TaN) film
resistor (hereinafter referred to as TaN film resistor)
formed by impressing a DC voltage of 5000 V between a
cathode composed of Ta and an anode in a gaseous atmosphere
comprising N2 gas and Ar gas under conditions of 400 °C for
the atmospheric temperature, 400 °C for the substrate
temperature, and 1 x 10-4 mmHg for the partial pressure of
the N2 gas to sputter the Ta cathode. Literature 1
describes that the TaN film is of a sodium chloride type
structure rather than the anticipated hexagonal type
structure. Further, Literature 1 describes production of
Ta2N of hexagonal structure (hereinafter referred to as
Ta2Nhex) and mixtures of the Ta2Nhex and TaN of a cubic
structure. Hence, it is understood that Literature 1
discloses a resistor comprising a film composed of a
tantalum nitride substantially comprised of TaN only 
(seemingly contaminated with foreign matters) (this
tantalum nitride material will be occasionally called TaN
single body in the following), a tantalum nitride material
substantially comprised of Ta2N only (seemingly
contaminated with foreign matters) (this tantalum nitride
material will be occasionally called Ta2N single body in
