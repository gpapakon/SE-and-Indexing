<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an electroacoustic transducer and a 
method of fabricating the same, employing a lead frame (40) to integrally 

form a plurality of component parts, thus reducing the number of 
individual component parts, and improving assembly efficiency. The 

electroacoustic transducer comprises a base (8), a yoke (4) fixed to the base 
(8), a core (6), a coil (10) wound around the core (6), magnet (12) 

surrounding the coil (10), a support ring (20) surrounding the magnet 
(12), a vibrating plate (24) supported on the support ring (20), lead 

terminals (2A, 2B, 2C, 2D) fixed to the base (8), and a case (32) having a 
sound emitting cylinder (36) and joined to the base (8) so as to cover those 

components. A gap (35) is formed between the core (6) and the diaphragm 
(24). The diaphragm (24), the gap (35), the core (6), the yoke (4) and the 

magnet (12) form a closed magnetic path. The coil (10) drives the 
diaphragm (24) for vibration when energized. The yoke (4) and the lead 

terminals (2A, 2B, 2C, 2D) are integrally formed of a common metal 
material such as the lead frame (40). The core (6) may be integrally 

formed with the yoke (4) of the lead frame (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electroacoustic transducer for
converting electric input signals into sound, and a method of fabricating
the same.Electroacoustic transducers are employed in various miniature
electronic devices, such as card-shaped portable pagers. Miniaturization
of electroacoustic transducers to be incorporated into such miniature
electronic devices has been requested and efforts have been made for the
further miniaturization of the component parts of electroacoustic
transducers.Figs. 14 and 15 show a conventional electroacoustic transducer.
The construction of and a method of fabricating this conventional
electroacoustic transducer will be described. A cylindrical upper case 102
and a cylindrical lower case 104 are formed individually of a synthetic
resin by molding. A yoke 106 is attached to the lower side of the lower case
104 and a base plate 108 is attached adhesively to the lower surface of the
yoke 106. A core 110 has a lower end fixedly inserted in a hole formed
coaxially through the yoke 106 and the base plate 108. A coil 112 is
mounted on the core 110, and an annular magnet 114 is disposed so as to
surround the coil 110. Leads 116 and 118 of the coil 112 extend outside
from the back side of the base plate 108 and are soldered to electrodes 120
and 122 formed on the base plate 108, respectively. The yoke 106, the core
110 and the magnet 114 form an electromagnetic transducing portion 126
for driving a diaphragm 124. The lower case 104 has a supporting stepped portion 128 near the
upper open end thereof on the inner surface thereof, and a large diameter
portion 130 formed at the upper open end of the lower case 104 to form the
supporting stepped portion 128. The diaphragm 124 is seated on the
supporting stepped portion 128. A magnetic piece 132 is attached to the
central portion of the diaphragm 124 to increase the vibrating mass of the
diaphragm 124.An engaging portion 134 of the upper case 102 is fitted in the large
diameter portion 130 of the lower case 104, and the upper case 102 and the
lower case 104 are joined together in an integral unit by joining means,
such as ultrasonic welding. Thus, a resonance space 136 that resonates
with the vibration of the diaphragm 124 is formed in the upper case 102 to
produce an appropriate sound pressure. A sound emitting cylinder 140
coaxially having a through hole 138 projects into the resonance space 136
from the inner surface of the top wall of the upper case 102.This electroacoustic transducer has a basic construction for
converti
