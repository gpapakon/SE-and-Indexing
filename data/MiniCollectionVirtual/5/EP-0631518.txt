<ABSTRACT>
The surface element is intended for formation of a gliding surface e.g. in a down-slope or the like. The surface element (e) comprises a substantially transverse frame unit (1), a gliding unit (3) and a supporting unit (4). The frame unit (1) is equipped with attaching means (2) for attaching the surface element (e) into a base (A). The gliding unit (3) comprises several flexible gliding means (3a) attached to the joining point (L) of the frame unit (1), such as fibres, strings, threads or the like. The supporting unit (4) comprises at least one supporting surface (4a) connected with the frame unit (1) and continuously supporting the gliding unit (3) of the surface element substantially in the longitudinal direction (s). The supporting unit (4) of the surface element (e) is arranged in connection with the frame unit (1) in a way that in the coating formed of several successive surface elements (e1, e2, e3) in the longitudinal direction (s), the supporting unit (4) of the next surface element (e2, e3) forms the supporting surface (4a) supporting the gliding unit (3) of at least one preceding surface element (e1, e2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface element 
for use in longitudinally overlapped relationship with like surface 
elements for the formation of a gliding surface. Gliding elements forming a gliding surface have been 
used for a long time, most usually in down-slopes of 
ski jumping hills and at the sides of in-run ski 
tracks uphill. Gliding elements of relatively small 
size have been arranged side by side and one after 
another in a way that the abutments of the gliding 
are overlapped to achieve an integrated gliding surface 
formed by the gliding parts. The gliding properties 
of the gliding surface correspond very well to the 
properties of snow, which is important for ski jumping 
corresponding to winter conditions also in the summer. The gliding elements are attached to a framework, 
such as a metal net, mounted in the slope and thus 
placed directly below the gliding surface. Consequently, 
there is the risk if the ski-jumper falls that 
the fibres forming the gliding unit turn away and the 
ski-jumper hurt himself when falling onto the metal 
net exposed. For eliminating this problem, an improved gliding 
unit is presented in the Patent Publication FI-71065.  
 The solution presented in the publication is characterized 
in that a bottom plate, either uniform or 
formed of separate strips, corresponding substantially 
to the size of the gliding element is attached 
to the same abutment below a plastic mat. As an 
advantageous embodiment, also a profile bottom plate 
is presented in the publication. With the profile form, 
an attempt has been made to make the gliding element 
flexible in order to avoid the need of using an 
additional flexible layer, usually of cellular plastic, 
commonly used underneath the metal net. In spite of 
its advantageous principle, the said solution has 
obviously not convinced the users, because its application 
in practice has remained insignificant. Particularly when equipped with a uniform bottom 
plate, the embodiment described above might, in 
principle, function in a reasonable way. Nevertheless, 
this embodiment still has the disadvantage 
typical of conventional gliding elements that the 
length of the gliding unit of the gliding element 
substantially corresponds to the total length of the 
gliding element. However, relatively long fibres do 
not function satisfactorily, because in practice 
they are placed and returned into the longitudinal 
direction at random. Consequently, e.g. after the 
previous jump, the coating may have openings with 
uncovered
