<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns an automatic procedure and machine 
necessary to realize the same, for sewing pre-ironed patch 

pockets. 
The procedure in question involves the manual application 
of the pocket on the clothing item in question as another 

previously applied pocket is sewn, and the automatic 
lateral unloading of the clothing item upon completion of 

sewing. 
The machine performing the working procedure according to 
the invention involves the use of two innovative devices: 

one for automatically feeding the sewing station and the 
other for the lateral unloading of the item sewn at the 

sewing station.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an automatic procedure
for sewing pre-ironed patch
pockets.Pre-ironed patch pockets are currently applied by means of
special sewing machines that automatically sew the pocket
on to the clothing item in question, such as the relevant
section of pants, a shirt or a jacket.These machines are characterized by a double clip under the
sewing head, mounted on a trolley that moves along two
orthogonal axes.Said double clip consists of a fabric-holding plate and a
pocket-holding plate operating within the first; more
specifically, the larger fabric-holding plate features a
wide centre opening conforming perfectly to the shape of
the pocket to be applied on the fabric.The shape of the pocket-holding plate is similar to that of
said opening, but smaller so as to house within the same
allowing a space along the perimeter along which the needle
moves during sewing. Said double clip is designed firstly to hold the pocket and
clothing fabric separately above the sewing surface and
secondly to pull the pocket and clothing item together
along a closed curved line, coinciding with the sewing
line.In this type of sewing machine, the clothing item and the
pocket are loaded manually by the operator.In particular the operating cycle includes the following
phases:
A) Manual loading of the clothing item under the sewing
head and under the raised double clip;B) Lowering by the operator of the fabric-holder plate;C) Manual positioning of the pocket in the centring opening
of the fabric-holding plate;D) Lowering by the operator of the pocket-holder plate;E) Starting by the operator of the sewing phase followed by
the automatic unloading of the sewn clothing item that is
lifted and stacked in front of the sewing machine, just in
front of the sewing station.Some sewing machine models feature an automatic device for
loading the clothing item; this device consists essentially
of a special clip that lifts the clothing item from a
storage station and transfers the same under the fabric-holder
plate which then lowers automatically on the fabric
when this is released by the carrying clip.Even in these cases, the pockets are loaded manually by the
operator who first places the pocket into the centring 
opening on the fabric-holder plate and then lowers the
latter, and starts sewing.The US patent 4493276 describes a patch pocket sewing
machine whereby the pockets are loaded on a template
positioned next to and at the back of the sewing head which
transfers the "pocket + garment" under a pocket setter unit
positioned

<CLAIMS>
An automatic procedure for sewing pre-ironed patch
pockets consisting of the following operating phases:


a) manual loading of the clothing item (M) on the work
surface (6) under the fabric-holder plate (4a);
b) lowering, by the operator, of the fabric-holder
plate (4a) over the clothing item (M);
c) manual application of the pocket (T) on the clothing item
(M),
d) automatic feed of the clothing item (M) with pocket
(T) under the sewing head (1 ) provided with a double clip (2)

designed to clamp and translate the pocket and clothing
item - held against each other - under the sewing head (1);
a procedure characterised
in that phases a), b) and c) occur during the sewing
phase of the previously applied pocket (T);
and in that phase d) occurs simultaneously with the
phase in which the previous clothing item (M) is removed from under the

double clip (2) and transferred along surface (6) to a 
clothing item (M) unloading station positioned next to the

sewing head (1) and on the side opposite to the clothing
item (M) loading point.
Procedure according to claim 1, characterised in that the
operations for removal of the clothing item (M) from under

the double clip (2) and transfer of the clothing item (M) on to
the work surface (6) and to an unloading station for clothing

item (M) are both carried out by a device (5) performing
simultaneous runs in the same direction to device (4)

designed to transfer the clothing item (M) and the pocket (T)
from the loading station to under the sewing head (1).
