<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a method for ironing a textile article, in which, in the course of an ironing cycle, the textile article is subjected at least to the simultaneous action of a thermal treatment and of a mechanical ironing treatment, in conjunction with a steam treatment in the course of at least one part of the ironing cycle, characterised in that it involves:   - at the start of the cycle, selecting a programme from the predetermined steam-cycle management programmes as a function of the type of article to be ironed, - during the ironing cycle, automatically ensuring, without the user's intervention, the emission of steam at the frequency corresponding to the selected programme.   -Method and device for steam ironing.

A method of ironing a textile article, in which the textile
article is subjected to an ironing treatment comprising a steam

treatment, said method consisting in selecting a programme, from
among pre-established programmes for managing the steam cycle, as a

function of the nature of the article to be ironed, and in
automatically ensuring the emission of steam during the ironing

cycle, without intervention from the user, at the frequency
corresponding to the selected program, the method being characterized

in that, the pre-established programs include at least one programme
for emitting steam in a sequenced cycle, such a programme alternating

period of steam emission and dry periods.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists
in proposing a programme for emitting steam in a sequenced cycle in

which the steaming duration is equivalent to the non-steaming
duration.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists
in proposing a programme for emitting steam in a sequenced cycle in

which the steaming duration is different from the non-steaming
duration.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists
in associating each programme that ensures sequenced management of

the steam cycle with a steam emission frequency characteristic of
said programme and different from that of other programmes.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists
in proposing a programme for emitting steam continuously.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that it consists, simultaneously with the selection step, in

automatically ensuring that the selected steam cycle is initialized.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that it consists, after the selection step, in controlling or 

stopping the emission of steam by detecting respectively the presence
or the absence of a part of the body of a user on a control member.
A method according to claim 7, characterized in that it consists
in detecting the presence or the absence of the hand of the user,

preferably on the handle of a smoothing iron.
A method according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that it
consists, at the start of the cycle, after a first detection of

presence, in activating the automatic control for emitting steam by
detection of presence, by actuating an activation means.
A method according to any one of claims 7 to 9, characterized in
that it consists in automatically switching off the power supply of

the steam production and emission means when no detection of presence
has been evident by the end of a pre-established time interval.
An ironing appliance designed for implementing the method
according to any one of claims 1 to 10, the appliance including

display means (10) for displaying information representative of the
various programmes for managing the steam cycle, selection means (11)

for selecting a programme for managing the steam cycle, memory means
for memorizing the various programmes and the selected programme, a

microprocessor connected to the steam production and emission means
of the appliance, and programmed to manage and control the emission

of steam automatically in application of the cycle corresponding to
the selected programme, the appliance being characterized in that the

microprocessor is programmed to propose at least one programme for
emitting steam in a sequenced cycle which alternates steam cycles and

dry cycles.
An appliance according to claim 11, characterized in that the
microprocessor is programmed to propose a programme for emitting

steam continuously.
An appliance according to claim 11 or 12, characterized in that
it includes an electrical connection circuit connecting the steam 

production and emission means to the connection means of the
appliance so as to ensure that said production means operate as soon

as the appliance is switched on.
An appliance according to any one of claims 11 to 13,
characterized in that it includes a contact detector (12) of the

presence or the absence of the user, said detector (12) being
functionally connected to the steam production and emission means.
An appliance according to claim 14, characterized in that it
includes electrical means functionally connected to the

microprocessor to swith off the power supply of the steam production
and emission means automatically when the detector (12) or a steam

control member (13) has not been activated by the end of a pre-established
time interval.
An appliance according to any one of claims 11 to 15,
characterized in that it is constituted by a steam iron (2).
An appliance according to claim 16, characterized in that the
steam iron (2) is associated with an external steam generator (1).
