<ABSTRACT>
A ropeway, especially a chair lift with disengageable grips 15, is equipped with a device for stabilising the grips at the approach of a stationary support 12 particularly at the entrance of a station. This device comprises stabilising rails 25, 26 arranged in front of the stationary support in order to bring the grip progressively into the correct position. The height position of these rails is adjustable automatically as a function of the position of the rope 10.

<CLAIMS>
An aerial rope tramway comprising an endless
carrying-hauling cable (10) running between two

stations, cable-supporting rollers (11) carried by
fixed supports disposed at the entrance to the stations

and/or along the line, cabins or chairs (13) fixed to
the cable on line to be moved between the two stations,

each cabin or chair having a clamp (15) to be coupled
to the cable (10) and a hanger (14) jointed to the

associated clamp, and a clamp stabilisation device
having at least one stabilisation element (25, 26)

integral with one (12) of the fixed supports and one
connected element (20) integral with the clamp (15)

which cooperated to bring the clamp coupled to the
cable to a predetermined position for the passage of

the fixed support, characterised in that it includes a
device for positioning the stabilisation element in

height of said stabilisation element (25, 26) to retain
it in a fixed vertical position with respect to the

cable (10), by moving the stabilisation element
according to the cable vertical motions.
An aerial rope tramway according to claim 1,
characterised in that the stabilisation element (25,

26) carried by the fixed support (12) comprises a rail
extending along the path of motion of the clamp (15) to

bring the clamp into said predetermined position while
it is moved along such rail and in that said rail is

moved in height according to the cable vertical motions
to maintain a fixed vertical position of the rail with

respect to the cable.
An aerial rope tramway according to claim 1 or
claim 2, characterised in that the clamp (15) carries a

conveyor roller (20) and in that the stabilisation 
element (25, 26) carried by the fixed support (12)

cooperates with said conveyor roller (20).
An aerial rope tramway according to claims 1,
2 or 3, characterised in that the stabilisation element

(25, 26) carried by the fixed support (12) comprises
two rails extending along the clamp (15) path of motion

to counteract on the clamp and bring it to said
predetermined position while it is moved along such

rails.
An aerial rope tramway according to any one of

the preceding claims, characterised in that it includes
a cable (10) position detector (32) mechanically

connected to the stabilisation element (25, 26) carried
by the fixed support (12) to position such element (25,

26) in height and maintain it in a fixed vertical
position with respect to the cable.
An aerial rope tramway according to claim 5,
characterised in that said detector comprises a pair of

rollers (32) positioned on both sides of the cable
(10).
An aerial rope tramway according to any one of
the preceding claims, having a disengageable clamp (15)

and a running rail (21, 22) for catching the clamp
disengaged from the cable, characterised in that said

running rail (21, 22) extends up to the end of the
fixed support (12) and in that it is lengthened

upstream by means of a stabilisation rail, the word
"upstream" being defined with respect to the motion

direction of the clamp (15).
An aerial rope tramway according to claim 7,
characterised in that said stabilisation rail includes

a jointed end at the end of the running rail (21, 22)
and an opposite end, upstream, whose position in height

depends on the position of the cable. 
An aerial rope tramway according to claims 7
or 8, characterised in that it includes two

stabilisation rails that diverge upstream and are
positioned on both sides of a roller (20) carried by

the clamp (15) and set away from the jaws.
An aerial rope tramway according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that said

connected stabilisation element (20), integral with the
clamp, is made up or carried by the hanger (14).
