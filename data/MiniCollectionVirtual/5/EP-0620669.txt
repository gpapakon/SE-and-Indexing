<ABSTRACT>
Calls made from telephone terminals T1-Tn via a telephone 
network C are handled concurrently within a receiving 

station D by processing systems P1-Pn that by means of 
automated voice messages prompt the callers through an 

interactive sequence (Fig 3) to operate their telephone 
push-buttons 14 to signal digital data to the station D. 

Digital data received from each caller and derived 
otherwise from his call, is stored (Figs 2 and 4) and, 

according to the processor operating format selected, 
gives specific identification of the caller, health data, 

and call sequence-order or time, together with processor-derived 
data which the caller is prompted to signal back 

to the processor for confirmatory purposes. Selection of 
format, and with it the particular processor PR1-PRn 

used, depends upon the number called as signalled to the 
receiving station by a dialled-number identification 

system (DNIS) of the network C. The format may 
alternatively relate to telephone-order purchasing (Fig 

5), participation in a lottery, or participation in a TV 
auction, gameshow (Fig 7) or opinion-poll. The caller is 

first checked for qualification to participate before 
processing of the gathered data is carried out. Calls 

may be transferred to be progressed with assistance from 
an operator's terminal IT when qualification checks are 

not satisfied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and system
for interactive call-handling, of the kind in which calls
from a multiplicity of telephone instruments or other
terminals of a communication network are received by a
processing station that interfaces the network, and data
streams received from the terminals via the communication
network during concurrent calls are processed
concurrently within the processing station automatically
or, selectively, with operator assistance, and the
processing of each call involves data relating to the
caller communicated to the processing station.A method and system of this specified kind are
known from WO-A-87 00375 in which telephone subscribers
make calls to a central data-receiving station according
to a merchandising, game, auction, lottery, poll or
public-service function. For the poll or public-service
function, digital data provided by the callers is
analyzed for the purpose of isolating a subset of the
callers as a way of, for example, identifying the
purchasers of certain possibly defective or dangerous
products or persons who possibly have a susceptibility to
a specific infirmity or disease. The collection of data
for processing from each caller is carried through using
automated voice prompting of the caller to communicate
requested items of data to the central station by
operating the push-buttons of his/her telephone handset.The items of data received from the caller are
stored at the central station in an individual memory
file or cell in association with data specifically
identifying the caller. The data stored may include the
caller's telephone number as a basis for qualifying the
caller to be involved in the poll or public-service
function.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method and system of the said specified kind 
offering improvement over what is known from WO-87 00375.
More particularly, it is an object of the present
invention to facilitate use of this kind of method and
system in a wider context and with broader application
than the known method and system.According to one aspect of the present
invention, a method of interactive call-handling of the
said above-specified kind, is characterised in that calls
are processed concurrently within the processing station
according to any of a plurality of different data-processing
formats, that the processing station is
supplied automatically from within the network with
signals that identify in respect of each call the
destination number that was called by the calling
terminal in setting
