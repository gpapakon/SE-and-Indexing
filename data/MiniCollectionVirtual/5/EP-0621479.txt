<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new method for detecting and/or quantifying various classes of immunoglobulins specific for an autoimmune disease, present in a body fluid from a patient, in which the body fluid is collected from the patient, the various classes of immunoglobulins present in this body fluid are reacted with an antigenic conjugate specific for the disease and consisting of a fatty acid and/or a phospholipid, which is (are) linked to a water-soluble protein, and with a labelled reactive agent specific for a class of immunoglobulin and the various classes of immunoglobulins are detected and/or quantified. The invention also relates to the kit for detecting and/or quantifying these various classes of immunoglobulins.
