<ABSTRACT>
A medical catheter (10) for treating atherosclerotic plaque and other abnormalities includes for an ultrasonic transducer (34) system which makes use of optical fibers (30) for transmitting ultrasonic signals through the catheter (10). The optical fibers (30) extend through a probe (28) which is rotatable inside of the catheter tube (12) to permit the ultrasonic system to sweep the entire area of the catheter tip (30a). In an alternative form of the invention, multiple transducers (164) are carried on disks (162) that rotate with the probe (28), and slip ring electrical contacts (154) establish electrical connections (156) with the rotating parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the medical catheters
and in one aspect to an ultrasonic transducer system
having transducers located externally of the catheter for
sensing the character and configuration of the area that
is to be medically treated by the catheter.It has long been known that cardiovascular problems are
caused by the presence of atherosclerotic plague on the
walls of veins and arteries, especially coronary arteries.
For some time, there has been interest in the use
of laser energy to remove plaque and to treat abnormalities
on internal organs in the body. Typically, it is 
proposed to use a catheter that contains optical fibers
for transmitting the laser energy through the catheter to
the area that is to undergo treatment. Lasers have also
been used to treat other medical problems such as tumors
or other abnormalities in the colon, esophagus, prostate
and other areas of the body.U.S. Patent No. 4,576,177 to Webster discloses a catheter
which includes optical fibers in combination with an
ultrasonic transducer having the capability of transmitting
and receiving ultrasonic signals. The reflections
of the ultrasonic signals from the tissue are received by
the transducer to provide information as to the character
and configuration of the tissues so that the laser energy
can be applied properly to the plaque lesion and not to
unoccluded artery walls or other healthy tissues.In the device disclosed in the Webster patent, the ultrasonic
transducer takes the form of a flat ring which is
oriented at an angle to the axis of the catheter. With
this arrangement, it is necessary to rotate the catheter
through a full 360Â° circle in order to direct the ultrasound
at the entire circumference of the artery. The
need to manually rotate the catheter is at best a severe
inconvenience and an inaccurate procedure because the
catheter cannot be accurately stepped through incremental
arcs in order to provide a reliable profile of the arterial
plaque. If the ultrasound techniques are inadequate
to provide the instrument with an accurate configuration
of the plaque, the laser energy can be misdirected such
that it is not only ineffective in treating the problem
but also possibly destructive of healthy tissues.The transducer is located in the tip of the catheter,
and the space that it requires there causes the catheter
to have a relatively large tip. It is also necessary to
extend electrical wires through the catheter to the
transducer, and this complicates the catheter construction
and adds to its cost.

A catheter (10) for insertion into the body to effect medical treatment
comprising:


a catheter tube (12) and an elongated tubular probe (28) adapted for insertion into said catheter tube, said probe

transmit at least one of ultrasonic signals and laser energy.
A catheter in accordance with Claim 2 wherein said fibers (30,70,180) are arranged within
said tip portion (28a) in a defined pattern, said defined pattern comprising a geometric

configuration for localizing the transmission of energy signals through said plurality
of fibers.
A catheter in accordance with Claim 5 wherein said fibers (30) are arranged in a
plurality of concentric circles (160) defined pattern.
A catheter in accordance with Claim 5 wherein said fibers (70) are arranged in a
plurality of bundles (162) defined pattern, wherein each said bundle comprises a plurality of fibers. 
A catheter in accordance with Claim 5 wherein said fibers (30) are arranged in a spiral (166)
defined pattern extending from a center to an outer wall of said probe.
A catheter in accordance with Claim 1 wherein said elongated catheter
tube (12) has a first end (12a) and a second end (12b), wherein said probe (28) extends through said catheter tube (12).
A catheter in accordance with Claim 9 wherein said probe tip portion (28a) extends
beyond said catheter tube first end (12a) into the body.
A catheter in accordance with Claim 9 wherein said probe (28) is configured to be
axially rotatable within said catheter tube (12).
A catheter in accordance with Claim 9 further comprising at least one annular
balloon seal (18) secured to said catheter tube (12).
A catheter in accordance with Claim 2 further comprising at least one ultrasonic
transducer (34) coupled to at least one of said optical fibers (30) to apply ultrasonic signals thereto for

transmission along said fiber to said tip portion (28a) thereof and from said tip portion into
