<ABSTRACT>
An increased resolution thermal ink jet printhead
construction and method for forming large array heater

chips for thermal ink jet printheads is achieved by
fabricating a unitary "megachip" in which multiple cells

(21) of electrical components are defined in a plurality
of columnar patterns in a plane of a silicon wafer

(100). Cells of a first column are vertically offset
from cells of an adjacent column so as to overlap the

gap between cells in the first column. The megachip is
then formed by grouping at least one cell from each of

two adjacent columns and dicing the wafer to remove the
megachip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink jet printers,
and more particularly, relates to increased resolution
thermal ink jet printhead construction and a method for
forming the same.The present invention is advantageously employed in
an ink jetting method which employs kinetic energy for
ejecting ink droplets by transferring thermal energy
into the ink. In this method, a rapid volumetric change
occurs in the ink resulting from a liquid to vapour
transition of the ink caused by the thermal energy. As
a result, an ink droplet is ejected from an ejection
outlet (nozzle) formed in a recording head, thereby
creating an ink droplet. The ink receiving, or
recording medium, is placed close to the nozzle, and the
ejected droplet contacts the surface of the recording
medium to establish information recording.A recording head, or printhead, used in the above
described ink ejecting method, in general, has the ink
ejection outlet or nozzle for ejecting ink droplets and
an ink liquid passage which communicates with the ink
ejection outlet which includes an electro-thermal
converting element for generating the thermal energy.
The electro-thermal converting element includes a
resistance layer or resistor for heating by applying a
voltage between two electrodes in the resistive
material. In this type of printhead, forces are applied
into the ink in the ink liquid passage, which are
induced by capillary action, pressure drops or the like,
and are balanced so that a meniscus is formed in the
liquid passage adjacent to the ink ejection outlet.
Every time an ink droplet is ejected, by means of the
above mentioned energy applied to the ink, ink is drawn 
into the ink passage and a meniscus is formed again in
the ink passage adjacent the ink ejection outlet.Thermal ink jet heater chips, or dies, are
conventionally formed with active semiconductor devices
in silicon. The heater silicon chips include arrays of
resistive and active elements oriented both horizontally
and vertically that, in conjunction with mating nozzle
plates, form nozzles for thermal ejection of ink drops.
Depending upon the physical orientation of the nozzle
plate relative to the print receiving medium, (e.g.
paper), the vertical height or extent, diameter of the
nozzles and spacings between nozzles determine the
vertical size of the print swath and the horizontal
width and spacing determine the packing density and
firing rate ability of the printhead. As printing
speeds and resolution density increase, larger and
larger arrays of elements are required. These
