<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmitter
for coding error correction codes which transmits
data In the unit of cells (packets) in Asynchronous
Transfer Mode. It may especially generate burst
errors caused by cell loss, adding to random errors.Conventionally, a transmitter for coding error
correction codes in which random errors and burst
errors may occur uses interleave methods. Symbols are
set in two dimensional direction, which are the
direction of transmission, and the orthogonal
direction of transmission: Error correction codes are
generated to the orthogonal direction of
transmission.Fig. 44 shows a transmission frame composed of
cells which applies interleave methods. The
interleave methods are described in page 220 "Hugo-riron
(Code Theory)" written by Hideki Imai published
by The Institute of 
Electronics Information and a Communication Engineers
(Heisei 2).L data cells 1 are composed of N data symbols, in
Fig. 44. K check cells 2 are composed of N check
symbols. The transmission frame has L data cells and K
check cells. The transmission frame comprising (L + K)
cells uses interleave method. Input data are set at A
point in the upper left of the transmission frame to B
direction and are set at C point to the direction of
numeral 3 and ends at D point in the right below
direction.The operation is explained as follows. In Fig. 44,
error correcting coding is carried out from L symbols in
every data cell to the orthogonal direction of
transmission, that is, the horizontal direction (the X
direction in Fig. 44). Then, K check symbols are
generated and stored in K check cells 2. The
transmission frame is transmitted in cell units to the Y
direction (the vertical direction), in Fig. 44. Assuming
that error correction codes are Read Solomon codes having
a frame length for error correction of (L + k) symbols
and K check symbols, errors of K/2 symbols (Omit
fractions) can be corrected in the X direction. A
maximum loss of K cells caused by transmission noise or
congestion of network can be decoded, if the location of 
the lost data cells is identified.The transmission frame includes data in an information
field 42 between an information of header 41
and an information of trailer 43 as shown in Fig. 43.
Problems to be Solved by the InventionAs has been described in the related art, the
conventional transmission frame composed of cells
uses interleave methods in units of symbols for the
error correcting coding, In order to correct errors
effectively, it is necessary to set the length of (L
+ k)
