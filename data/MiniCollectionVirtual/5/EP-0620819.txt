<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIPARASITIC AGENTSThis invention relates to antiparasitic agents, related to the milbe ycins and to processes for their preparation and compositions thereof.The avermectins and milbemycins form an important group of broad spectrum antiparasitic agents possessing anthelmintic, ectoparasiticidal, insecticidal, antibacterial and antifungal activity with application in the areas of animal and human health, agriculture and horticulture. The avermectins are a group of macrolide compounds (previously referred to as C-076) isolated from the fermentation broth of an aver ectin producing strain of Streptomyces avermitilis such as those deposited strains ATCC 31267, ATCC 31271, ATCC 31272 as described in US patents 4310519 and 4429042. European patents 214731 and 276103 disclose a related series of compounds differing from the C-076 compounds in the nature of the substituent at C-25. The milbemycins form another group of related acrolides which are distinguished from the avermectins in lacking a sugar residue attached at C-13. Examples of such compounds are the B-41 series as described in UK patent 1390336, the LL-F28249 series described in European patent EP 170006, the E225 compounds described in European patent 254583 and the N787-182 compounds described in European patent application 334484. In addition to these fermentation products a large number of publications describe compounds derived semi-synthetically from these fermentation products many of which possess useful antiparasitic activities. Some of this chemistry is reviewed by Davies, E . G . 'and Green, R.H. in Natural Product Reports (1986) , 2, 87-121. 

 Our European Patent Application 410615 describes a compound, herein designated UK-86956 of formula:It may be made by fermentation of a micro-organism deposited at the American Type Culture Collection under accession number ATCC 53928.It has been found that certain semi-synthetic derivatives of the above-mentioned compound UK-86956, also have antiparasitic activity. Thus one aspect of this invention provides compounds of formula (I) :
 where R1 and R2 are independently selected from H, Cj-C8 alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, C2-C8 alkanoyl, alkenoyl and alkynoyl, arylalkanoyl, arylcarbonyl and Cj-C8 alkylsulphonyl and arylsulphonyl groups, wherein all these groups other than H may optionally be substituted with at least one hydroxy, Cj-Cg alkoxy, carboxy or halo group with the proviso that at least one of R1 and R2 are other than hydrogen. The alkane, alkene and alkyne 

groups may be straight or
