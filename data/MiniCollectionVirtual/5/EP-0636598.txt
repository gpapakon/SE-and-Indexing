<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new industrial 
processes for the preparation of vitamin K derivatives, 
which play an important role in the vital body as 
hematostatic vitamins, and intermediates useful for the 
preparation thereof. Naphthoquinone derivatives, which are vitamin K 
derivatives, have heretofore been prepared by reacting 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone 
(menadione) or the like with an 
allyl halide derivative by the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Besides, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
(KOKAI) No. 56935/1985 (EP-A-132741) discloses a process for preparing a 
naphthoquinone derivative by forming 1,4,4aα,9a-tetrahydro-9aα-methyl-1α,4α-methanoanthraquinone 
from 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone 
and cyclopentadiene, reacting 
this product with an allyl halide derivative into a 
1,4,4aα,9a-tetrahydro-9aα-methyl-4aα-alkenyl-1α,4α-methanoanthraquinone, 
and then refluxing the thus-obtained 
product under heat in a toluene solvent to conduct a Retro  
 
Diels-Alder reaction. In the conventional processes for preparing 
naphthoquinone derivatives, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone 
which is a starting material has been extremely expensive 
and hence difficult to obtain in a great amount on an 
industrial scale. Further, naphthoquinone derivatives 
produced by conducting the Friedel-Crafts reaction undergo 
geometric isomerization on the allyl group as indicated by 
the following chemical reaction formula. Therefore, the 
final product is provided as a mixture of an intended 
trans (E) isomer and a cis (Z) isomer formed as a by-product. 
In addition, they are very difficult to separate 
from each other to purify them because their 
physicochemical properties are similar to each other. 
Accordingly, this process has not been said to be an 
industrially or economically satisfactory process. 
On the other hand, the process disclosed in Japanese  
 
Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 56935/1985 can 
improve the disadvantage that the geometric isomers are 
formed, but has remained using 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone 
as a starting material. Therefore, a problem has remained 
unsolved from the viewpoint of obtaining the starting 
material. In addition, the process disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 56935/1985 
requires a strong base such as a metal amide, lithium 
dialkylamide, alkali metal t-butyrate, sodium hydride or 
potassium hydride for the reaction of 1,4,4aα,9a-tetrahydro-9aα-methyl-1α,4α-mehtanoanthraquinone 
or the 
like with an allyl halide derivative. However, these
