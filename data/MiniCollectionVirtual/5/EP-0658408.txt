<ABSTRACT>
The shuttering has positioning elements for moulding the faces of each step. The elements are arranged in a zigzag series over the base and are pivoted in a holder that can turn about an axis vertical to the base. They are adjustable not only with regard to their angular position but also the distance of the neighbouring axles from each other, so that different step heights and widths can be obtained. The adjustments for each are independent. There is a mechanism coupled to the axles and/or elements with a pivot arm for each axle. All arms give the same acute angle with the sliders for the axles....

Shuttering for the manufacture of concrete stairs,
having positioning elements (20, 24) which are associated

with the shuttering walls for the tread face and the
abutting face of one step each, and which are arranged above

a shuttering base (28) alternating with each other in a
zig-zag-shaped row, each of them being positioned pivotably

about an axis (22) perpendicular to the shuttering base in a
holding device (6) and being jointly adjustable both with

regard to their angular position and with regard to the
distance of the adjacent axes (22) from one another for

setting the height of the step and the width of the tread by
means of a first adjustment device (14, 15, 29, 34 to 38;

118, 137, 154) and a second adjustment device (18, 19, 29 to
33; 115, 129, 130, 134, 150), and being fixable in selectable

positions, wherein the second adjustment device (18, 19,
29 to 33; 115, 129, 130, 134, 150) is designed for changing

the width of the tread without changing the height of the
step, characterised in that the first adjustment device (14,

15, 29, 34 to 38; 118, 137, 154) is also designed for changing
the height of the step without changing the width of the

tread.
Shuttering according to claim 1, characterised in that
a pivot drive (14, 15, 18, 19) is provided and is, on the

one hand, coupled to each of the axes (22) and/or their
positioning elements and, on the other hand, is actuatable

by means of the drive portion (30 to 37, 39, 39') of both
adjustment devices, in that the pivot drive has a pivot arm

(20) for each of the axes (22), all the pivot arms enclose
an acute angle of identical size with the direction of

displacement of the axes (22) and are guided at the same
distance from the associated axis (22) in a pivotable and 

longitudinally displaceable manner in a guide (19', 44, 144)
which is parallel with the direction of displacement of the

axes (22) and whose distance from the guide (4, 5) of the
axes (22) is variable for the purpose of pivoting the pivot

arms (20), and in that two slides (14, 19), each having at
least one control cam (15, 18; 115, 118) determining transverse

displacement, are provided for transverse displacement
of the linear guide (19', 44, 144) of the pivot arms (20)

and are displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the
guide.
Shuttering according to claim 2, characterised in that
the pivot arm (20) extends in the direction of extension of

one of the two positioning elements or forms one of the
positioning elements (20, 24).
Shuttering according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that each control cam (15') of the first slide (14) is

supported on a control cam (18') of the other slide (19) for
the purpose of adding together the transverse displacement

amounts determined by the two control cams (15', 18').
Shuttering according to claim 2 or 3, characterised by
addition of the transverse displacement amounts, determined

by the control cams (115', 118'), with the aid of at least
one hydraulic working cylinder (151) and of hydraulic

control pistons (150, 154) which control the working cylinder
and follow the control cams (115', 118').
Shuttering according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the axes (22) are guided in a straight

guide (4, 5; 104, 105) and are connected to a coupling
device (29; 129) which keeps the distances between 

immediately adjacent axes (22) identical and varies the
distances by the same amount if a change takes place.
Shuttering according to claim 6, characterised in that
the coupling device is in the form of scissor gear (29;

129).
Shuttering according to any one of claims 2 to 5 and 6
or 7, characterised in that the two adjustment devices have

a carriage (34; 134) which is movable in the direction of
the guide (4, 5; 43) for the axes (22) and is fixable in

selectable positions and to which both the coupling device
(29; 129) and the pivot drive are coupled 
via
 a respective
carrier device (30, 31, 37') which is positive-locking in

both directions of movement.
Shuttering according to claim 8, characterised in that
the carrier devices are in the form of coupling rods (30,

31, 37') which are in the form of toothed racks at least
over a portion of their length, and in that those toothed

racks are each in engagement with a respective gear wheel
(32, 33, 36) of two rotary drives, of which at least one

gear wheel (32, 33) is arranged on the carriage (34).
Shuttering according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that, of the positioning elements (20, 24),

with the exception of the positioning elements forming the
two ends of the row, in each case the positioning element

(20) associated with the tread face is integrally formed
with, or rigidly connected to, the immediately adjacent

positioning element (24) associated with the abutting face
and encloses an angle of 90Â° therewith, and in that those

pairs of positioning elements (20, 24) are carried by the
associated axis (22) in the region of the apex of the angle.
