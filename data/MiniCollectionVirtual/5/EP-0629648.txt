<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method for the 
preparation of carbinol-functional organosiloxanes and 

carbinol-functional organosiloxane resins. The method 
comprises contacting a cyclic silyl ether with an organosiloxane 

or an organosiloxane resin at a temperature within a 
range of 25°C. to 150°C. The method may be conducted in the 

presence of an inert organic solvent to facilitate 
dissolution and contact of the reactants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a method for the
preparation of carbinol-functional organosiloxanes and
carbinol functional organosiloxane resins. The method
comprises contacting a cyclic silyl ether with an organosiloxane
or an organosiloxane resin at a temperature within a
range of 25°C. to 150°C. The method may be conducted in the
presence of an inert organic solvent to facilitate
dissolution and contact of the reactants.Several methods for preparation of cyclic silyl
ethers useful in the present invention have been described.
For example, Knoth et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80:4106, 1958,
describe the preparation of various 2,2-disubstituted 1-oxa-2-silacycloalkanes
by heating the corresponding (chloroalkyoxy)chlorosilanes
with metallic sodium or lithium. Knoth
et al. further report that the cyclic silyl ethers can be
hydrolyzed to form the corresponding bis-(hydroxyalkyl)tetraalkyldisiloxanes.
Speir et al., J. Org. Chem. 25:1637,
1960, teach that 1,3-bis(hydroxypropyl) tetramethyldisiloxane
prepared by the methanolysis of 1,3-bis(acetoxypropyl)tetramethyldisiloxane
loses water during distillation to form
2,2-dimethyl-1-oxa-2-silacyclopentane. Speir et al. further
teach that the equilibrium can be shifted in favor of the
cyclic silyl ether by use of a drying agent such as lime
during the distillation process. US-A 2,983,744 shows a
process for the production of cyclic silyl ethers, the
process involving reacting with two equivalents of an alkali
metal or alkaline earth metal an omega-halogeno-alkoxydihydrocarbohalogenosilane.
The 2,2-dihydrocarbo-1-oxa-2-silacycloalkanes
prepared by the described method are readily
converted by hydrolysis to long chain oxadisila-alpha,omega-diols. 
US-A 3,505,380 discloses a hydrosilation process for
preparing cyclic silyl ethers, the process comprising
contacting in the presence of platinum catalyst a mixture of
an unsaturated silicon hydride, unsaturated silicon compound
and silicon hydride. Chen et al., Organometallics 6:2590,
1987, teach the preparation of cyclic silyl ethers by adding
triphenylmethyl perchlorate to a methylene chloride solution
of the corresponding silyl hydride.Gol'din et al., Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii 45:2451,
1975, reveal a process for the preparation of carbofunctional
siloxanes. The process involves the reaction of cyclosiloxanes
with carbofunctional disiloxanes containing
hydroxy-, carboxy-, acyloxy- or cyano-terminal groups in the
presence of a catalytic ion-exchange resin.The method of the present invention can yield a
near quantitative yield of
