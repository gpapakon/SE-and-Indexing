<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for binding loose stacked sheets (10), which device comprises a first strip [bar] (1) in which a series of holes are cut. Engaging in these holes, after passing through corresponding holes formed along one lateral edge of the sheets, are elongate parts projecting perpendicularly from a second strip placed against the last opposing sheet of the stack. More particularly, the aforementioned parts take the form of a series of small, superimposed rods (5).
