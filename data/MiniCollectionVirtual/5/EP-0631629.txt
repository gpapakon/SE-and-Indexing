<ABSTRACT>
Fungus-responsive chimaeric genes are used in the production of transgenic plants which can produce plant cells surrounding the fungus infection that become capable of killing, disabling or repelling the fungus or that are themselves killed or rendered unsuitable for the fungus to feed upon, thereby preventing the spread of the fungus infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use, in a transgenic plant, of at least a portion of a
fungus-responsive prp1-1 promoter to induce (i.e., stimulate), in response to a fungus
infection of the plant, the expression of a gene or a DNA fragment substantially
selectively in cells of the plant around the site of the fungal infection. The use of the
prp1-1 fungus-responsive promoter of this invention is especially valuable in
transgenic plants for controlling a foreign gene or a DNA fragment that is to be
expressed selectivily in the cells of the plant which immediately surround the fungal
infection site so as to render the plant resistant to the infecting fungus, particularly a
plant-pathogenic fungus.This invention also relates to a first or fungus-responsive
chimaeric gene that can be used to transform a plant
and that contains a first foreign DNA that:
a) encodes a product which, when expressed in cells of the
plant immediately surrounding a fungal infection site, can
either i) kill or at least adversely disturb significantly
the plant cells immediately surrounding the fungal
infection site or ii) kill, disable or repel one or more
fungi in the fungal infection site; andb) is under the control of at least a portion of the
fungus-responsive prp1-1 promoter of this invention.This invention further relates to a cell of a plant, the
genome of which is transformed to contain the first
chimaeric gene and optionally a second or restorer chimaeric
gene; the second chimaeric gene contains a second promoter
that controls a second foreign DNA encoding a product which
can inhibit or inactivate the first foreign DNA or its
encoded product at least in cells of the plant other than
those immediately surrounding a fungal infection site,
particularly when the first foreign DNA encodes a product
that can kill or adversely disturb significantly such other
plant cells.This invention yet further relates to: a) the fungus-resistant 
transgenic plant, such as a Solanaceae (e.g.,
tomato or potato) or Brassicaceae (e.g., oilseed rape),
which is regenerated from the plant cell of this invention
transformed with the first and optionally the second
chimaeric genes of this invention, b) fungus-resistant
transgenic plants derived from the regenerated transgenic
plant and seeds of such plants, and c) plant cell cultures,
all of which consist essentially of the transformed plant
cells of this invention.The plants of this invention are characterized by the
fungus-responsive expression of the first chimaeric gene of
this invention in plant
