<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR INTERSTITIAL TREATMENT Related Application The present application is a continuation- in-part of U.S. patent application No. 07/625,332, filed December 10, 1990.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an apparatus and method for interstitial treatment or diagnosis in organs, in particular, by insertion of an elongated shaft of the apparatus into a body passage adjacent the organ to be treated and extension of a cannula into the organ for delivery of treatment or diagnosis at a selected site within the organ. More particularly, the cannula includes an interstitial locking means for reversibly locking the cannula in place after positioning and during treatment.Background of the InventionAdvances in medical technology have provided many new treatments and diagnostic techniques. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,950,267 to Ishihara et al. discloses a laser beam treatment device for an endoscope. The endoscope delivers a laser probe to a position in a body, from which the laser probe is thrust into the part of the organ to be treated. However, the disclosure is not too specific as how the laser probe is inserted into the organ. Also, U.S. Patent No. 5,047,026 to Rydel discloses an electrosurgical implant for cutting through tissue. The instrument includes two separate terminals at the distal end that provide an arc discharge when a RF voltage is applied, thereby allowing the device to cut tissue. No provision, however, is made for transporting the distal end to a particular treatment site with minimal damage to healthy tissue surrounding the treatment site. 

 Other treatment techniques include the implantation of radioactive seeds for radiation therapy or interstitially cell-targeted drug therapies. Also, many different types of diagnostic techniques are known, such as endoscopic or ultrasound visualization. However, suitable apparatus and methods for applying these techniques interstitially are lacking in the artThus, despite the numerous advances and new techniques developed for medical treatment and diagnosis, there remains in the art a need for a suitable apparatus and method to interstitially deliver such treatments to or conduct diagnosis at selected sites within an organ, without excessive and unnecessary damage to tissue surrounding the treatment site.Summary of the InventionIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for interstitially delivering various treatments or diagnoses to selected sites within an organ.It is a
