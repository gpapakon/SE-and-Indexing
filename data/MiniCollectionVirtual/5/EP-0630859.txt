<ABSTRACT>
A substrate material for a biofilm is disclosed for use in 
a biofilm reactor characterised in that the substrate 

material comprises a three-dimensional thermoplastic 
polymeric layer composed of a ground layer having a sheet 

structure with or without a multiplicity of perforations or 
openings, or having a net structure, and which ground layer 

is provided at least at one major side with a multiplicity 
of projections. Also the use is disclosed of the said 

substrate material as substrate material for the biofilm in 

a biofilm reactor. Furthermore, a biofilm reactor is 
disclosed containing the said substrate material for the 

biofilm, as well as a process for the purification of 
aqueous effluents containing organic waste by means of the 

said biofilm reactor. The substrate material and the 
biofilm reactor are suitable for use in systems for the 

purification of waste waters from agro-industries, food 
industries and beverage industries.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a substrate material for use in 
a biofilm reactor. More particularly, this invention 
relates to a three-dimensional thermoplastic polymeric 
layer for use as substrate material for the biofilm in a 
biofilm reactor, to the use of a three-dimensional 
thermoplastic polymeric layer as substrate material for the 
biofilm in a biofilm reactor, and to a biofilm reactor 
containing the said substrate material. The substrate 
material and the biofilm reactor according to the invention 
are particularly suitable for use in a system for the 
treatment of aqueous effluents which contain organic waste. 
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for 
the purification of an aqueous effluent containing organic 
waste by the said biofilm reactor. It is well known since several decades that aqueous 
effluents containing organic materials (hereinafter waste 
waters) can be purified to a certain extent by the action 
of micro-organisms. Many micro-organisms, indeed, are 
capable of degrading, under aerobic and/or anaerobic 
conditions, organic compounds and organic materials, 
(collectively termed herein organic waste) and, in this 
manner, to remove organic waste from or reduce its 
concentration in waste waters. Under aerobic conditions, 
organic carbon (i.e. carbon comprised in an organic 
compound) is biologically degraded yielding energy used by 
the micro-organismss for their metabolic functions, carbon 
dioxide, water and biomass material, whereas organic 
nitrogen (i.e. nitrogen comprised in an organic compound) 
is biologically transformed by a nitrification process via 
ammonia into nitrate and energy, which nitrate can, by a  
 
biologically denitrification process, be further 
transformed into molecular nitrogen. Based on the degrading action of micro-organisms, many 
systems for the treatment of waste waters, have been 
developed (the terms treatment and purification are used 
interchangeably hereinafter). Some of these purification 
systems, particularly systems for the treatment of sewage, 
are in use at large scale for many years. The term 
"sewage" herein refers in particular to domestic waste 
waters and to aqueous discharges containing organic waste 
which can be biologically decomposed similarly easily. In 
these purification systems the micro-organisms are commonly 
present in the form of a so-called "biomass". Such biomass 
is composed of one species or - commonly - of multiple 
species of micro-organisms and extracellular products such 
as exopolysaccharides
