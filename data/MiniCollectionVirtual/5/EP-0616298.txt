four directions on one lower film, and forming one common electrode so as to 

confront all four electrodes on the other upper film, on the mutually 
confronting surfaces of two upper and lower films, and possessing pressure 

sensitive elements made of pressure sensitive rubber or the like varying in 
the resistance by the pressure in the thickness direction between the 

electrodes and the common electrode, disposed between the independent 
electrodes and the common electrode, a pressure plate having protrusions 

provided in four direction so as to press the pressure sensitive elements, 
and an operation lever for pressing the pressing plate provided movably 

on the pressing plate, and an input apparatus using the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a position input device such as pointing
device used in personal computer, word processor, other information processing
apparatus, and home-use game appliances, and an input apparatus using the
same.A prior art is described by reference to a pointing device using a
strain gauge shown in Fig. 17 (a), (b), and (c). As shown in the diagram, on
four sides of a bar-shaped stick 23, strain gauges 24a, 24b in the X-axis
direction, and 25a, 25b in the Y-axis direction are adhered.The four strain gauges 24a, 24b, 25a, and 25b are connected as shown in
Fig. 17 (c), that is, the strain gauges 24a, 24b in the X-axis direction
being in series, and the strain gauges 25a, 25b in the Y-axis direction being
in series.The operation of the pointing device is described below. The force
applied in the stick 23 distorts the stick 23 in the X-axis and Y-axis, and  
the strain gauges 24a, 24b, 25a, and 25b measure voltages Vx, Vy of which
resistance is changed by the distortion of the stick 23, and therefore the
direction of the applied force is detected by the synthesis of the changing
amounts of the X-axis and Y-axis, and the magnitude of the applied force, by
the absolute value of tne changing amounts of the X-axis and Y-axis.However, in such conventional constitution, since strain gauges are
used, it is expensive. Other problems were the poor operation feeling such
as difficulty in recognizing the feeiing in actual manipulation, and the
difficulty in making compact.Further close prior art is known form US-A-4,313,113.
This document discloses an input device comprising a
lower film with four electrodes and an upper film on a
movable pressing plate. The upper film is a common electrode
and a pressure sensitive element is disposed between
the electrodes on the upper and lower films.It is hence a primary object of the invention to present a compact
position input device capable of detecting the direction of force and
magnitude of force, being inexpensive and excellent in controllability, and
an input apparatus using the same.The invention provides a position input device comprising a lower film
disposing four independent electrodes in four individual directions, an upper
film disposing a common electrode confronting said independent electrodes, four, pressure sensitive elements, each pressure sensitive element having a variable resistance, and each pressure sensitive element
being disposed between a respective said independent electrode and said common electrode, a pressing plate having an
upper
