<ABSTRACT>
The base section (2) has a bottom wall (7) defining two lower
longitudinal edge regions (6); and each of them is provided successively

without interruption with: a first portion (8) as an extension of the raceway
(1) bottom wall (7), which extends slopingly upwardly and outwardly; a

second downwardly directed portion which, with the first portion (8),
externally forms an inverted valley (9); and a third upwardly directed

portion which, with the downwardly directed portion, forms externally an
inverted hip (10) which is at a higher level than the level determined by the

lower surface of the bottom wall (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a raceway base section for
electrical cable systems, said base section having a generally 'U' shaped
cross section comprising two walls and having a bottom wall defining two
lower longitudinal edge regions and a lower surface; and said raceways
being made of plastics material and having a flattened cover section.The majority of base sections of the above type have the two lower
longitudinal edge portions thereof, adjacent the bottom wall of the base
section, forming a more or less rounded edge. This arrangement has the
drawback that it forms a gap between the base section and the flat surface
on which the base section rests, in which dust gathers and highlights the
faulty seating of the base section due to the surface irregularities of the
vertical wall.To overcome this drawback, in certain cases such edges have
been beveled and this, although it hides the accumulation of dust and
facilitates the cleaning thereof, it does not prevent it from being observable
and that the said faulty seating due to the irregularities of the vertical wall
is highlighted.It is an object of the invention to overcome the above-mentioned
drawback. This object is attained with a base section of the type first
mentioned above wherein each of said longitudinal edge regions
comprises successively without interruption: [a] a first portion as an
extension of said raceway bottom wall, said first portion extending relative
to said bottom wall slopingly upwardly and outwardly; [b] a second
downwardly directed portion which, with said first portion, externally forms 
an inverted valley; and [c] a third upwardly directed portion which, with said
downwardly directed portion, forms externally an inverted hip and is
continued by one of said walls; said hip being at a higher level than the
level determined by the lower surface of said bottom wall.As a result of this, while the said drawbacks still do appear, they
are not perceptible to the eye, since a screen is formed which hides both
the accumulated dust and the faulty seating due to the surface
irregularities of the vertical wall.To facilitate an understanding of the object of the invention, there
will be described hereinafter one embodiment of the raceway base section
for electrical cable systems, with reference to the accompanying drawing.Figure 1 schematically shows the right cross section of one lateral
half of a raceway for electrical cable systems, in which one of the lower
edges, formed according to the invention, has been drawn in solid line and
