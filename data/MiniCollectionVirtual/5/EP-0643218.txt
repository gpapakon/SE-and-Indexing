<ABSTRACT>
Device for controlling the opening of a shutter (7) for shutting off a pipeline (8), characterised in that the shutter (7) for shutting off the pipeline (8) is controlled in a first direction by a device using a spring (1) made of an alloy with shaped memory as soon as the temperature rises, and a return spring (2) which actuates the shutter (7) in the opposite direction to the first direction as soon as the temperature drops.

<CLAIMS>
Device for controlling the opening or closing of
a flap for shutting off a conduit for a fluid, the flap

for shutting off the conduit being controlled in a first
direction, as soon as the temperature rises above a first

threshold, by means of a device employing a spring,
produced from a form memory alloy, and a return spring,

which actuates the flap in the direction opposite to the
first direction, as soon as the temperature falls below

a second threshold, the spring (1) made from form memory
alloy acting on a first face of a piston (3) integral

with a linkage (6) actuating the flap (7), the return
spring acting on the other face of the piston (3),

characterized in that the assembly consisting of the
piston (3) and of the spring (1) made from form memory

alloy and the return spring (2) are arranged in a well
(41) closed by means of an adjustable plug (5).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the dimensions of the well can be adjusted in order

to modify the stroke of the linkage (6).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the rigidity of the return spring

can be modified in order to adapt the temperature
response characteristics of the device.
Device for adjusting the air temperature, comprising
a pneumatic servomotor, the control pressure

chamber of which is connected directly or indirectly to
the suction port of an internal-combustion engine,

characterized in that the movable element of the servomotor
is made integral with the well of a device for 

controlling the opening of a flap according to one of
Claims 1 to 3.
