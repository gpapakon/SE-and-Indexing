<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for manufacturing a concrete 
building component with a number of plate-like parts 

standing at a mutual angle. 
The method comprises of providing a mould (12) having a mould 
space with corresponding plate-like sections (2-7) which 

corresponds with the shape of the building component, which 
mould space has a pouring opening (17) on one side, positioning 

the mould such that the pouring opening (17) lies at the top and 
successively filling the plate-like sections (2-7), wherein the 

mould (12) is in each case positioned for filling each plate-like 
section (2-7) such that the plate-like section for filling stands 

at a minimal angle relative to the vertical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a
concrete building component with a number of plate-like
parts standing at a mutual angle. Such a component is for
instance a building element with the cross section of a
number of stair steps
(see f.i. US-A-3,055,146).
To enable compliance with minimum
quality standards it is usual to assemble such a building
component from a number of separate building elements each
having the cross section of a single step. Prefabrication of
concrete elements with a relatively small wall thickness and
a number of plate-like parts standing at a mutual angle has
up to the present not been possible to a sufficient level of
quality.The invention now has for its object to provide a
method with which such a concrete building component can be
manufactured in one operation.This object is achieved with the method according to
claim 1. By placing the mould for each plate-like section of
the building element to be filled in an optimum position,
each section is successively filled under optimum
conditions and each section thereby acquires a good quality.
The total building component will therefore likewise have
the desired good quality.The method of claim 2 is preferably applied. It has
been found that with applying of this step the desired
quality can be achieved under practically all conditions.
Air inclusions in the mould which can result in cavities in
the component are effectively prevented.A further favourable development is characterized in
claim 3. This ensures that the concrete for pouring flows
well to the section for filling without vibrating equipment
being necessary for transport of the concrete in the mould.
The use of vibrating equipment to displace the concrete is
undesired since segregation can therein occur. According to a further development the method of claim
4 is applied. This contributes to proper filling of the
lower-lying sections in reliable manner.The invention likewise relates to and provides a device
for manufacturing a concrete building component having a
number of plate-like parts standing at a mutual angle.
According to the invention this device comprises a frame, a
mould mounted hingedly on the frame and having a mould space
with corresponding plate-like sections which corresponds
with the shape of the building component, which mould space
has a pouring opening at the top, a concrete pouring device
disposed above the pouring opening, drive means for tilting
the mould into a desired pivot position and control means
for the drive means. During

Method for manufacturing a concrete building
component with a number of plate-like parts standing at a

mutual angle, providing a mould (12) having a mould
space with corresponding plate-like sections which

corresponds with the shape of the building component, which
mould space has a pouring opening (17) on one side, characterised by positioning

the mould such that the pouring opening lies at the top and
successively filling each of the plate-like sections (2-7), wherein

for each section to be filled the mould is (re)positioned
such that said plate-like section stands

at a minimal angle relative to the vertical,
in order to effectively displace the air out of the successive

sections.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the minimal
angle amounts to a maximum of 45°.
Method as claimed in any of the foregoing claims,
wherein positioning of the mould takes place such that all

plate-like sections between the section for filling and the
pouring opening also stand at an angle smaller than 90° to

the vertical.
Method as claimed in any of the foregoing claims,
wherein positioning of the mould takes place such that a

straight line between the pouring opening and the plate-like
section for filling also encloses a minimal angle with the

vertical.
Device for manufacturing a concrete building
component

according to the method of claim 1,
having a number of plate-like parts standing at a

mutual angle, comprising a frame (11), a mould (12) mounted hingedly
on the frame and having a mould space with corresponding

plate-like sections which corresponds with the shape of the
building component, which mould space has a pouring opening (17)

at the top, a concrete pouring device disposed above the
pouring opening, drive means (20, 21) for tilting the mould into and holding the mould

in a number of different
desired pivot positions

and for separating the mould parts (15, 16),
and control means for the drive

means. 
Device as claimed in claim 5, wherein the control
means are programmed control means which control the drive

means according to program for successively positioning the
mould in different pivot positions.
Device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the concrete
pouring device comprises a weighing device with which the

amount of concrete poured each time can be determined, which
weighing device is coupled to the control means and wherein

the control means activate the drive means in each case to
place the mould in a subsequent pivot position after a

determined weight of concrete has been poured into the
mould.
