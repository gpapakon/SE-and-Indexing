<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are improvements in methods for the isolation of endotoxin-binding proteins which are secreted by transfected host cells in appropriate cell culture media. In its preferred embodiment, the invention comprises addition of a cation exchange material to the media as the means of increasing the yield of recombinant endotoxin-binding proteins, such as bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part
of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/885,501,
filed May 19, 1992.The present invention generally relates to
improved procedures for the preparation of endotoxin-binding
proteins by recombinant methods and more
particularly to processes for the large scale
production of recombinant endotoxin-binding proteins,
such as bactericidal/ permeability-increasing (BPI)
protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP),
high density lipoprotein, Limulus anti-LPS factor,
tachyplesin, and structurally related proteins using
genetically transformed host cells grown in culture,
including culture in fermentors.Endotoxin, or lipopolysaccharide, is a
component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria
and is implicated in the manifestation of acute
bacterial infections. Numerous proteins have been
reported which bind to the principal form of
endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide ("LPS"). Examples of
such LPS-binding proteins are
bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein ("BPI 
protein") lipopolysaccharide-binding protein ("LBP"),
incorporated by reference herein], high density
lipoprotein, and tachyplesin [Nakamura, et al.,
J. Biol. Chem., 263: 16709-16713 (1988), incorporated by
reference herein].Certain of these proteins share significant
structural homology. For example, both BPI and LBP
possess a positively-charged amino terminal region of
approximately 25 kDa which is the portion of each
molecule which binds to the lipid A portion of LPS.
See Schumann, et al., Science, 249:1429-1431 (1990).Binding of BPI protein to membrane-bound LPS
increases the envelope permeability of susceptible
Gram negative bacteria. Ooi, et al., J. Biol . Chem.,
262:14891 (1987). BPI protein also binds to soluble
LPS and human BPI protein has been isolated from
polymorphonuclear neutrophils ("PMNs") by acid
extraction combined with either ion exchange
chromatography or E. coli affinity chromatography.
Elsbach, et al. J. Biol . Chem., 254:11000 (1979);
Weiss et al., Blood, 69:652 (1987). The holo-BPI
protein isolated from human PMNs has potent
bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of
Gram-negative bacteria. Elsbach, et al., J. Biol.
Chem., 254:11000 (1979). This antibacterial activity
appears to be associated with the amino terminal
region of the isolated human holo-BPI protein. In
contrast, the carboxyl terminal region of the isolated 
human BPI protein displays only slightly detectable
anti-bacterial activity. Ooi, et al., J. Exp. Med.,
174:649 (1991).Human DNA encoding BPI has been cloned

protein, wherein genetically transformed host cells are

cultured in a medium suitable for cell growth and
maintenance and wherein the desired protein is secreted

into said medium, the method comprising the following steps

endotoxin-binding protein bound thereto from said medium;

and
isolating said endotoxin-binding protein from said
cation exchange material.

protein binds to the lipid A region of ba
cterial
lipopolysaccharide.
The method of Claim 1, wherein said endotoxin-binding
protein is bactericidal/permeability-increasing

protein.
