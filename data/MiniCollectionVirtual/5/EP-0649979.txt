<ABSTRACT>
The combustion chamber of an engine is formed in a 
double insulation structure where partially stabilized 

zirconia (PSZ) materials having a lower thermal conductivity 
are disposed between two walls for thermal insulation. The 

double insulation structure comprises a head liner 1 made of 
a silicon nitride material and an outer tubing 2 which are 

separated by a space. A plurality of gaskets 3, i.e. the 
PSZ materials, are arranged in the space, each comprising a 

PSZ thermal insulator 31 sandwiched between two contact 
claddings 32 made of stainless steel or copper. 
Accordingly, the escape of heat from the head liner 1 
will be minimized by the PSZ material having a lower thermal 

conductivity thus to increase a thermal insulation quality 
of the combustion chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal insulation 
engine and particularly, a thermally insulated engine structure 
having a combustion chamber section made of a ceramic 
or equivalent composite material which has a higher resistance 
to heat and thus increasing the thermal efficiency 
during the running at a high temperature without extra 
cooling service. A variety of thermal insulation engines have been 
developed having cylinders and pistons in the combustion 
chamber section made of highly heat-resistant ceramic or 
other composite materials rather than conventional metals to 
provide a higher thermal insulation structure, whereby the 
thermal efficiency during the running at a high combustion 
temperature will be increased without the use of any cooling 
system. In general, the combustion chamber of such a thermal 
insulation engine has a ceramic inner wall covered at outer 
side with a low thermal conductive material, thus comprising 
a composite construction. Accordingly, the thermal insulation 
engine can offer a higher thermal insulation effect 
with its structure. This type of the thermal insulation  
 
engines includes a zirconia coated combustion chamber engine 
as is best known. The engine of the foregoing type is however heat regist 
type combustion engine, but the quantity of heat removed 
from combustion gas to combustion chamber is large, so that 
the escape of heat can hardly be prevented. As the combustion chamber section of the engine is made 
of a high heat resistant material such as silicon nitride 
with its protective cladding of a low thermal conductive 
material, it is substantially reduced in the radiation of 
heat. It is known that the transfer of heat mass Q across the 
wall of a combustion chamber is calculated from: 
Q = As-Ki(Tg -Ta) where As is the surface area of the combustion chamber, Ki 
(i=1 or 2) is the thermal transmittance, Tg is the temperature 
of gas, and Ta is the temperature of air or water. If K1 is a thermal transmittance of the combustion chamber 
consisted of a composite material made of a stainless 
steel coated with a zirconia ceramicmaterial, it is expressed 
as: 
K1 = 1/(1/ag+d1/kpz+d2/kst+1/ac) It is now assumed that ag is a coefficient of heat transfer 
determined by the state of gas in the cylinder and 
commonly, 250kcal/(m °C h), ac is a coefficient of heat 
transfer from cooling water to cylinder body and commonly, 
5000 kcal/(m °C h), kpz is a thermal conductivity of zirconia  
 
as 5 kcal/(m °C h), and kst is a thermal conductivity 
of
