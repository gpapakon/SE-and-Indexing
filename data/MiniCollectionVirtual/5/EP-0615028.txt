<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a municipal cleaning vehicle for flushing out and cleaning sewers and tanks and the like, comprising a tank (10) having a sludge compartment (11) and a service-water compartment (12) which can be connected to a flushing hose (14) through which, by means of a pump device (15), water is delivered to that end of the flushing hose (14) which is provided with a nozzle head (16). In this arrangement, the water (19) which is delivered in a flushing hose (18) by means of a pump device (17) is heated by a heating means (20) before it is discharged out of the flushing hose (18).

device (17) is driven directly by the motor vehicle drive. 
Municipal vehicle according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
detergent (22) can be added to the water (19) to be heated. 
Municipal vehicle according to Claim 6, characterised in that the detergent (22) is 
stored in a dosing tank (21) by means of which it can be introduced into the connecting feed 

pipe (23) between the service water compartment (13) and the second pumping device (17).  
 
Municipal vehicle according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that at 
least the heating element (20) and the second pumping device (17) can be combined and
