<ABSTRACT>
A continuously variable transmission with a starting 
clutch (10) used as a fuse wherein a secondary 

pulley (91) is driven by a primary pulley through a chain belt (92) and 
the starting clutch (10) is operated through a range of pressure, 

comprising means (95,96) providing a transmission input torque for the 
secondary pulley (91) and chain belt (92) at a higher value than means 

(17,18) providing the torque for the starting clutch (10) throughout the 
range of pressure for operation of the starting clutch (10) such that the 

starting clutch (10) will initiate slippage before slippage of the 
chain belt (92) relative to the secondary pulley (91), the torque 

differential between the torques for the chain belt (92)/secondary 
pulley (91) and the starting clutch (10) decreasing as the operating 

pressure increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed herein relates to a 
starting clutch utilized in a 
continuously variable transmission (CVT) wherein the 
transmission is used in an automotive vehicle as the 
driving means between the engine or driving force for 
the vehicle and the road engaging wheels. Continuously variable transmissions have been 
known for a number of years as a driving means for the 
road engaging wheels of a vehicle to provide smooth 
acceleration without the usual shifting of gears by 
clutches and brake bands in an automatic transmission. 
A continuously variable transmission conventionally 
includes a pair of variable sheave pulleys, an endless 
belt extending between and in driving engagement with 
the pulleys and control means to alter the effective 
pulley diameters and thus change the belt ratio during 
operation of the vehicle. In automotive applications, a starting 
clutch is required on the driven pulley shaft 
as a starting device and for rotation of a shaft leading 
to the forward/reverse gearing to drive the final 
differential for the road-engaging wheels. The starting 
clutch is positioned on the driven pulley shaft so that 
the pulleys can be constantly rotating in one direction 
and rotation is not interrupted when shifting from 
forward to reverse and vice versa during vehicle 
operation. Thus, initiating movement of the vehicle is  
 
accomplished by a speed responsive friction starting 
device wherein a clutch is controlled by the 
hydraulic control means for the pulleys. Prior patents relating to hydraulically-actuated 
starting clutches cover a broad base of 
applications. One prior problem of such starting 
clutches resided in the centrifugally generated oil 
head pressure developed at the clutch piston during 
operation. The start clutch has a basic torque 
curve plus a centrifugally added torque as a result 
of the centrifugally induced oil pressure on the 
piston at elevated speeds. The chain belt/sheaves 
have a similar arrangement. In the past to keep the 
clutch torque (basic plus centrifugal torque) below 
the chain belt/sheave torque (basic plus 
centrifugal), balance weights were added to the 
clutch Belleville spring to counter the influence of 
the centrifugal torque of the clutch (see US-A-4 520 912), 
or a shroud was positioned 
either extending inwardly from the outer periphery 
of the clutch cover, as shown in US-A-4 699 259, 
or at least partially covering the open 
end of the piston chamber leading into the actuating 
chamber for the clutch piston, such as seen in 
U

<CLAIMS>
A starting clutch used as a fuse in a 
continuously variable transmission wherein a secondary 

pulley (91) is driven by a primary pulley through a 
chain belt (92) and the starting clutch (10) is operated 

through a range of pressure, comprising means (95, 96) 
providing a transmission input torque for the secondary 

pulley (91) and chain belt (92) at a higher value than 
means (17, 18) providing the torque for the starting 

clutch (10) throughout the range of pressure for 
operation of the starting clutch (10) such that the 

starting clutch (10) will initiate slippage before 
slippage of the chain belt (92) relative to the 

secondary pulley (91), characterised in that the torque difference 
between the torques for the chain belt (92)/secondary pulley 

(91) and the starting clutch (10) decreases as the 
operating pressure increases. 
A starting clutch as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the means (17, 18) providing the torque for the 

starting clutch (10) includes a piston (17) acting 
within a hydraulic cylinder (18), and the means (95, 96) 

providing the transmission input torque for the 
secondary pulley (91) and chain belt (92) includes a 

piston (95) acting within a hydraulic cylinder (96), 
hydraulic fluid being supplied from a throttle-induced 

pump to both hydraulic cylinders (18, 96) to initiate 
operation of the respective pistons (17, 95) therein, 

the relative diameters of the pistons (17, 95) being 
adjusted, to keep the starting clutch (10) torque (basic 

plus centrifugal) below the chain belt (92)/secondary 
pulley (91) torque (basic plus centrifugal), to a point 

where the resultant centrifugal torque of the starting  
 

clutch (10) is less than the centrifugal torque of the 
chain belt (92)/secondary pulley (91). 
A starting clutch as claimed in claim 2, 
including a Belleville spring (52) for preventing 

engagement of the starting clutch (10) until a predetermined 
piston (17) pressure is developed as a 

consequence of throttle advance thereby determining the 
functioning of the starting clutch as a "fuse".
