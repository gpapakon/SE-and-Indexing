<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle parking system in which each parking place (1) incorporated in the system is assigned a unique digital and/or alphabetical code which is unique to that particular parking space, characterized in that the vehicle (2) is assigned a unique digital and/or alphabetical code; and in that when a vehicle is parked in one such parking space and when parking of the vehicle is terminated, the parking space code and vehicle code together with a unique code assigned to the vehicle driver are sent to a database (5) for registration of the parking space, the vehicle concerned and the parking period, and for determining the parking fee and the address to which the parking fee shall be debited, on the basis of the data received.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle parking
system according to the preamble of
claim 1. A parking system encompassed by said preamble
is previously known through US-A-4 555 618.Pay parking spaces are found in all densely populated
areas, without exception. Various systems are found in
which a given fee is paid for an intended parking
period, this fee being deposited in cash into a parking
meter located at each parking space, or into a central
parking ticket dispenser which serves a vehicle parking
area and which issues a parking ticket disclosing the
period for which a parking fee has been paid, this
ticket being placed in the vehicle in a position where
it can be seen from outside the vehicle. Such pay parking
systems, however, are encumbered with a number of
serious problems. For instance, administration costs and
investment costs are high, as is also the cost of maintenance
resulting from malicious damage to the parking
meters or ticket dispensers, including the theft of the
coins contained therein, such damage requiring constant
repair of the meters and dispensers. In order to prevent
the theft of the cash content of such parking machines,
machines have been introduced with which parking fees
are "paid" through the medium of pay cards. Such machines,
however, assume that the vehicle owner is in
possession of such a card, and also means that the
machines must be adapted to accept the majority of pay
cards, credit cards, available to the public at large.
There is also the risk that climatic conditions will
cause such machines to malfunction and, of course, the
machines may also be damaged. The present invention provides a parking system which
eliminates the drawbacks of those parking systems known
hitherto and enables parking fees to be paid in a simple
fashion without needing to pay cash on the occasion of
parking the vehicle. The inventive parking system is
also cheaper with regard to administration, investments
and maintenance. This is achieved with an inventive
parking system having the characteristic features set
forth in the following Claims.The invention will now be described in more detail with
reference to an inventive parking system illustrated
schematically in the accompanying drawing.The drawing illustrates schematically a parking place 1
which has been assigned a numerical and/or alphabetical
code which is unique to that particular parking space,
for instance 1 2 3, and a vehicle 2 parked in said
space. According to the invention, the vehicle is assigned
a numerical and/or

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle parking system, comprising

a database (5) and
means for sending, in conjunction with parking a vehicle
in a car park and in conjunction with terminating a parking

period, a unique code assigned to the vehicle driver to the
database;
said database having means for registration of the parking
period and for determining the parking fee and the address

to which the parking fee shall be debited, on the basis
of the data received,
characterized
 in that

each parking space of the car park is asssigned a
unique digital and/or alphabetical code,
said sending means being adapted to send to said
database together with said unique code assigned to the

vehicle driver, in conjunction with parking the vehicle in a
parking space and terminating a parking period,

also a unique code assigned to the vehicle and the unique code
assigned to that parking space which is occupied by said

vehicle.
A parking system according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that the unique vehicle code is comprised
of the vehicle registration characters or parts of said characters.
A parking system according to any one of Claims 1 - 2,

characterized
 in that the means for sending said
codes to the database comprise a cordless transmitter or a

cable transmission.
A parking system according to any one of Claims 1 - 2,

characterized
 in that the means for sending said
codes comprise a telephone.
A parking system according to any one of the preceding
Claims, 
characterized
 in that the means for
sending said codes comprise a transmitter which is programmed

with the vehicle code and the code of the addressee.
