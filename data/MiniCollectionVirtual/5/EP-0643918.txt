<ABSTRACT>
A device for massaging a portion of meat, which device 
comprises a frame (1) and a vessel (17) supported in that fr
ame and 
driven rotatably on a lying axis, said vessel has a 

longitudinal wall (20) and two end walls (19,22), wherein agitation 
members (30) are arranged in the vessel, wherein the inner side 

of the longitudinal wall of the vessel is provided with 
agitation members standing thereon, wherein the agitation 

members are formed by hollow bodies, the closing edge of 
which is situated outside the vessel, so providing an easy 

discharge and cleaning of the vessel, whereas the agitating 
members can be easily constructed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for massaging a 
portion of meat, which device comprises a frame and a vessel 
supported in that frame and driven rotatably on a lying 
axis, said vessel has a longitudinal wall and two end walls, 
wherein agitation members are arranged in the vessel. Such a device is known in very many embodiments, 
wherein the cross section of the vessel has a circular form. 
Within the vessel blades are provided, which are movable 
independently of the rotation of the vessel and therefore 
apply a massage to the meat. The drawback to such members in 
the vessel is that they make difficult the discharging of 
the vessel and the subsequent cleaning. The members present 
in the vessel are moreover of quite complicated 
construction. The invention has for its object to obviate the above 
stated drawbacks by providing a device which is 
distinguished in that the inner side of the longitudinal 
wall of the vessel is provided with agitation members 
standing thereon, wherein the agitation members are formed 
by hollow bodies, the closing edge of which is situated 
outside the vessel. Owing to such agitation bodies the construction is very 
simplified and cooling of the meat mass is assured. 
According to a further feature the agitation members are 
formed by folded plates, wherein the fold is situated at 
least partially in the vessel and the edges of the folded 
plates are closed outside the vessel by means of a welded 
strip. As the welds of the hollow agitation bodies are located 
outside the vessel, possible leakage will not affect the 
meat mass to be massaged. The invention further relates to a 
device for massaging a portion of meat, which device 
comprises a frame and a vessel supported in that frame and 
driven rotatably on a lying axis, which vessel has a  
 
longitudinal wall and two end walls, in which wall a 
charging and/or discharging opening is arranged for the meat 
and/or cleaning liquid, which is distinguished in that the 
inner side of the longitudinal wall of the vessel is 
provided with a pattern of agitation members standing 
thereon, which pattern has at least a wall portion 
preferably extending axially from the opening which is 
without these agitation members so as to form a free flow 
path for the meat mass for massaging or cleaning liquid. Due to the free wall portion, which extends as a strip 
portion of the inner wall towards and away from the 
discharging and charging opening, the massaged meat mass 
respectively the cleaning liquid can flow away freely to 
th

<CLAIMS>
Device for massaging a portion of meat, which device 
comprises a frame and a vessel movably supported in that 

frame, said vessel being provided with one or more agitation 
members, characterized in that the inner side of the wall of 

the vessel is provided with one or more agitation members 
standing thereon, wherein one or more agitation members are 

formed by hollow bodies, the closing edge of which is 
situated outside the vessel. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the agitation members are formed by folded plates, wherein 

the fold is situated at least partially in the vessel and 
the edges of the folded plates are closed outside the vessel 

by means of a welded strip. 
Device for massaging a portion of meat, which device 
comprises a frame and a vessel movably supported in that 

frame, said vessel has a longitudinal wall and two end 
walls, in which wall a charging and/or discharging opening 

for the meat and/or cleaning liquid is arranged, 
characterized in that the inner side of the longitudinal 

wall of the vessel is provided with a pattern of agitation 
members standing thereon, which pattern provides at least a 

wall portion preferably, extending from the opening, which 
is free from said agitation members so as to form a free 

flow path for the meat mass to be massaged or cleaning 
liquid. 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 3, characterized in 
that the agitation members are formed by substantially 

straightened bodies. 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 3 comprising a 
vessel rotatably driven about a lying axis, characterized in 

that the agitation members extend at an angle relative to 

the axis of rotation which varies from 90Â°. 
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing claims 3-5, 
characterized in that the plate-like members are provided 

with channels as through-feed for a coolant. 
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that in cross section the longitudinal wall 

has a non-round form such that the part of the cross section 
momentarily under the rotation axis changes shape from a 

narrow form to a broad form and vice versa. 
Device as claimed in claims 7, characterized in that 
the cross section has an elliptical shape. 
Device as claimed in claims 8, characterized in that 
the cross section has an elliptical shape and the plate-like 

agitation members are arranged along the sides with a large 
radius of curvature.
