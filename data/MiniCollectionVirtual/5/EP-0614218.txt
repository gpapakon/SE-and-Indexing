<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more 
particularly, to a method for manufacturing a capacitor 
and a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS, broadly, a metal 
insulating semiconductor (MIS)) transistor on the same 
semiconductor substrate. Generally, in a highly-functional and highly-defined 
semiconductor device, a capacitor including lower 
and upper electrodes and a dielectric layer therebetween 
is formed on a thick insulating layer, i.e., a so-called 
field insulating layer which defines a field area, to 
thereby increase the capacity of the capacitor. Also, a 
MOS transistor is formed on an active area where the 
field insulating layer is not formed. In the prior art, when manufacturing the above-mentioned 
capacitor and the MOS transistor, the lower 
electrode is formed; the dielectric layer is formed; and 
afterwards, the upper electrode is formed simultaneously 
with a gate electrode of the MIS transistor. Thereafter, 
impurities are doped by an ion implantation into a 
semiconductor substrate to form source and drain regions 
within the semiconductor substrate. In the prior art, however, when doping 
impurities into the semiconductor substrate to form the 
source and drain regions, the upper electrode of the 
capacitor is covered with a photoresist layer, thus 
avoiding the introduction of impurities into the upper 
electrode. If such impurities are doped into the upper 
electrode, the impurities may reach an interface between 
the upper electrode and the dielectric layer, to thereby 
reduce the duration of the capacitor and increase the 
leakage current of the capacitor, thus deteriorating the  
 
reliability of the semiconductor device. In the capacitor manufactured by the above-mentioned 
prior art manufacturing method, however, since 
the concentration of impurities in the upper electrode, 
which is made of polycrystalline silicon, for example, is 
quite low, a depletion region may appear within the upper 
electrode in response to a voltage applied thereto. As a 
result, a capacity resulting from this depletion region 
is connected in series to an original capacity of the 
dielectric layer, to thereby substantially reduce the 
capacity of the capacitor. Thus, the capacity of the capacitor manufactured 
by the prior art method has a dependency on voltage 
applied thereto, and also it is difficult to suppress the 
voltage dependency below a level such as 0.05%/V required 
in a highly-defined analog circuit. It is an object of the present
