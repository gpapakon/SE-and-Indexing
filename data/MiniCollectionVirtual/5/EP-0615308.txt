<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved electric connector having 
terminals for contacting two circuit elements (34 and 35). 

Each terminal includes a flat intermediate base mounting 
section (2) having projections (7) on its opposite sides, a 

first cantilever contact beam (3) integrally connected to one 
end of the intermediate base section (2) extending toward the 

other end of the intermediate base section (2), and a second 
cantilever contact beam (4) integrally connected to the other 

end of the intermediate base section (2) extending toward the 
one end of the intermediate base section (2). The first 

contact beam (3) has a contact point (8) resiliently pushed 
against the upper guide wall (23). This will insure that the 

conductor (35) is sandwiched between the upper guide wall (23) 
and the contact point (8) making a good electrical 

connection. Likewise, the second contact beam (4) has a 
contact point (9) resiliently pushed against the upper wall 

(24). This will insure that the conductor (34) is sandwiched 
between the lower guide wall (24) and the contact point (9) 

making a good electrical connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved electric 
connector having an improved S-shaped terminal allowing for 
the interconnection of a group of first circuit elements 
with a group of second circuit elements. Where both groups 
of elements enter the connector housing from the same side. In the past, one conductor from a flat flexible cable 
(FFC) or first circuit element has been connected to 
another conductor such as a terminal lead from a florescent 
lamp or a second circuit element. The FFC conductor was 
connected to a selected conductor on a printed circuit 
board via an associated electric connector, and the 
selected conductor in the printed circuit board was 
connected to a terminal lead from the fluorescent lamp via 
another associated electric connector. Thus, one conductor 
is connected to the other conductor via a selected 
conductor in an associated printed circuit board, and 
accordingly since the two associated connectors must be 
affixed to the printed circuit board an additional amount 
of space is required for this electric connection. 
In an attempt to reduce the use of additional space on 
the printed circuit board, a single electric connector has 
been used to make a direct connection between the circuit 
elements without the connector being affixed to a printed 
circuit board. French Patent No. 1,480,097 discloses an 
"S"-shaped electric connector terminal which comprises a 
flat intermediate base section, a first contact beam  
 
integrally connected to and bent from one end of the 
intermediate base section, and a second contact beam 
integrally connected to and bent from the other end of the 
intermediate base section. These first and second beams 
are biased inwardly so that their contact portions achieve 
contact with the flat intermediate base section, thereby 
permitting each contact section and flat intermediate base 
section to sandwich one of the circuit elements 
respectively therebetween. This conventional "S"-shaped electric connector 
terminal permits two conductors or circuit elements to be 
electrically connected without the use of two connectors 
affixed to a printed circuit board. However there are some 
disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that two conductors or 
circuit elements must be inserted into opposite ends of the 
housing in opposite directions. Therefore, insertion and 
connection of two conductors or circuit elements in the 
same direction was not possible. The second disadvantage is that the first contact beam 
has its free end inclined
