<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (12) is provided with a housing (28) 
electrical contacts mounted to the housing, and ejectors 

(24) pivotally mounted to the housing (28). The ejectors 
(24) have pivot posts that extend in the same direction and 

spaced ejecting fingers (58). The pivot posts are axially 
slid into pivot holes at the edge of the housing (28) along 

a first direction. The ejectors (24) are then rotated in a 
second direction orthogonal to the first direction with the 

fingers (58) being received in finger holes in the housing 
to thereby prevent the ejectors being inadvertently 

disconnected from the housing. The fingers and finger holes 
extend, at least partially, between adjacent contact 

receiving holes in the housing. Detent locating of the 
ejectors is provided at an open position and a closed 

position. The housing (28) includes blocking projections to 
prevent connection of an integrated circuit chip other than 

in a predetermined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to an electrical connector having 
ejectors to eject or disconnect an electrical component 
from the connector. U.S. Patent 5,073,116 discloses a socket connector for an 
integrated circuit chip or module. U.S. Patents 4,712,159; 
4,345,267; and 4,587,595 disclose heat sinks for an 
integrated circuit or other electronic device package. 
U.S. Patent 5,000,692 discloses electrical connector 
sockets for relays with release levers. U.S. Patents 
5,167,517; 5,108,298; 5,057,029; 4,973,255; 4,898,540; 
4,579,408; 4,241,966; and 3,784,954 disclose other 
electrical connectors with ejectors. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, 
an electrical connector is provided comprising a housing, 
electrical contacts, and an ejector pivotally mounted to 
the housing. The ejector has a first section that is 
laterally slid in a first direction into a first receiving 
portion of the housing and a second portion that is then 
rotated in a second direction, orthogonal to the first 
direction, into a second receiving portion of the housing. 
Interaction between the second section and the housing 
prevents the ejector from inadvertently laterally sliding 
out of the first receiving portion. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention an electrical connector is provided comprising a  
 
housing, electrical contacts, and ejectors. The housing 
has a top surface, contact receiving holes, and ejector 
receiving areas. The ejector receiving areas include 
spaced finger holes extending into the housing from the top 
surface. The finger holes extend, at least partially, 
between adjacent contact receiving holes. The ejectors are 
mounted to the housing at the ejector receiving areas and 
include fingers movably located in the finger holes between 
recessed positions and extended positions. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention, an electrical connector is provided comprising 
a housing, electrical contacts, ejectors, and means for 
detent locating the ejectors. The ejectors are pivotally 
connected to the housing. The ejectors each have two arms 
pivotally connected to the housing and an intermediate 
bridging section connecting the two arms to each other. 
The means for detent locating can locate the ejectors at a 
first open position and a second locking position wherein 
the ejectors are retained at the first position and the 
second position until moved by a user. In accordance with
