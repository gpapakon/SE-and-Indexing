<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape cutting apparatus and is 
particularly but not exclusively concerned with a tape cutting 
apparatus used in thermal printing devices. Thermal printing devices of the type with which the present 
invention is primarily concerned operate with a supply of tape 
arranged to receive an image and a means for transferring an 
image onto the tape. In one form, a tape holding case holds a 
supply of image receiving tape and a supply of an image 
transfer ribbon, the image receiving tape and the transfer 
ribbon being passed in overlap through a printing zone of the 
printing device. A printing device operating with a tape 
holding case of this type is described for example in 
EP-A-0267890 (Varitronics, Inc.). Other printing devices have 
been made in which letters are transferred to an image 
receiving tape by a dry lettering or dry film impression 
process. In all of these printing devices, the construction 
of the image receiving tape is substantially the same. That 
is, it comprises an upper layer for receiving an image which 
is secured to a releaseable backing layer by a layer of 
adhesive. Once an image or message has been printed on the 
tape, it is desired to cut off that portion of the tape to 
enable it to be used as a label. Various cutting mechanisms have been disclosed for performing 
this function. In EP-A-0267890, cooperating scissor blades 
are used to cut off a portion of the tape. In EP-0322919, a 
blade mounted on a cutter support member is used to cut the 
tape, with the tape supported by an anvil. As described in 
EP-A-0364305 the anvil is provided by part of the cassette 
wall. The anvil can alternatively be part of the printing 
device or a separate component altogether. There have been 
found to be disadvantages relating to these cutting methods, 
and the present inventors have found that it is preferable to 
cut the tape using a blade which enters a slot below the tape  
 
rather than acting against an anvil. In this respect, 
reference is made to our copending Application No.94304284.6 
(Page White & Farrer Ref. 75930) published as EP-A-0 634 275. When cutting a tape by moving a blade through the tape into a 
slot, it is advantageous if the blade is sharp and angled. 
Moreover, the blade remains sharp during the life of the 
printing device as it is not blunted by action against an 
anvil. Moreover, as the blade is required to travel through a 
distance through the tape and into the slot, it cannot be 
wholly concealed throughout its travel. Thus,

A printing device in combination with a cassette (10) 
holding a supply (12) of tape (14), said cassette (10) being 

removably received in a cassette receiving bay (2) of the tape 
printing device, said printing device comprising a cutting blade 

(30) for cutting said tape after printing, characterised in that 
said printing device further comprises a blade protection device 

(52) comprising a blade protection member (58) mounted for 
movement relative to the cutting blade (30) so as to prevent 

movement of the blade (30) in a first position and to allow 
movement of the blade (30) in a second position, the blade 

protection member (58) being movable between the first and second 
positions by insertion of the cassette (10) into the cassette 

receiving bay (2). 
A combination according to claim 1, wherein the blade 
protection member (62) is mounted for movement in a channel 

member (54) located in a floor (56) of the cassette receiving bay 
(2) so that the blade protection member (58) protrudes above the 

floor (56) in the first position and does not protrude above the 
floor (56) in the second position. 
A combination according to claim 2, wherein the blade 
protection member (58) lies flush with the floor (56) in the 

second position. 
A combination according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the blade 
protection member (58) is resiliently mounted within the channel 

member (54) so that it is biased into the first position. 
A combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
cassette has a depending part (70) which locates a surface (60a) 

of the blade protection member (58) and causes it to move against 
the action of a spring (64) into the channel member (54). 
A combination according any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the 
blade protection member (58) includes an upstanding part (70),  

 
and the cassette (10') has an aperture (72) for receiving said 

upstanding part (70) when the cassette (10') is inserted into the 
cassette receiving bay (2). 
A cassette (10) intended for cooperation with a printing 
device having a cassette receiving bay (2), a cutting blade 

(30) for cutting tape (14) after printing and a blade protection 
device (52) comprising a blade protection member (58) mounted for 

movement relative to the cutting blade (30) so as to prevent 
movement of the blade in a first position and to allow movement 

of the blade in a second position, the cassette (10) comprising: 

a supply (12) of tape (14); 
a wall over which the tape (14) passes in use; and
