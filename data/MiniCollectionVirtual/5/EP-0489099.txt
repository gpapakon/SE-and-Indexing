<ABSTRACT>
Lever with a knob (1) and an elongated part (2). In one of its ends the elongated part (2) carries the knob and is at a distance from the end connected to a mechanism that is to be operated. The knob includes an electrical switch (14, 12). The knob (1) is movable radially relative to the longitudinal axis (3) of the lever part and has a cavity (4) into which the lever part (2) protrudes with one of its ends (10). The cavity (4) has a peripheral surface (11) which defines a space to the surface (12) of said end of the lever part. In the space there is located an elastically, ring-shaped centering element (13) which at its outer periphery abuts against said peripheral surface of the space and at its inner periphery abuts against the surface (12) of the lever part and a ring-shaped, electrical contact element (14) being part of the switch which is immovably connected to the knob and adapted to follow this in its radial movements. The centering element (13) strives at centering the contact element relative to the end part (10) of the lever part. In a neutral position for the knob the movable contact element defines a space to the end part of the lever part (the end part is included as a second contact element in the switch). By a manual sidewards movement of the knob relative to the lever part the ring-shaped contact element will be moved into an eccentric position and into contact with the second contact element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control lever having a 
knob and an elongated lever part which at its one end 
carries the knob and at some distance from said end is 
connected to a mechanism that is to be operated, the knob 
having an electrical switch as defined by the features 
of the first part of claim 1 and known from US-A 4 183 424. The present invention relates to that type of control 
levers that have a knob in which an electrical switch has 
been arranged, which can be actuated manually for 
changing between different positions of the switch. It is 
also known to arrange electrical switches in levers, 
for example a pushing switch which is attainable with the 
hand for switching in for instance an overdrive gear at a 
lever. For the operation of airplanes it is further known 
to arrange different types of switches in joy sticks. The object of the present invention is to obtain a lever 
by which a change of electrical condition of the electric switch is obtained 
automatically as early as possible during an operation 
and thereby obtain maximal precision in the contact 
function during mass production. The above object is obtained by means of a control lever according 
to the invention as defined by the features of claim 1.  
 The invention shall be explained in detail below in 
connection with some embodiment examples with reference 
to the attached drawings, in which 
Fig. 1is a central, axial section through the lever 
according to the invention in a first 
embodiment example along the line I-I in Fig. 
4, Fig. 2is a radial section through the device along 
the line II-II in Fig. 1,  
 Fig. 3is a central, axial section through the device 
along the line III-III in Fig. 4, Fig. 4is a radial section through the device along 
the line IV-IV in Fig. 1, Fig. 5is a section, corresponding to the one in Fig. 
2 but with the device in an activated 
position, Fig. 6is a section, corresponding to the section in 
Fig. 1 through the lever in a second embodiment 
example, Fig. 7is a section along the line VII-VII in Fig. 6, Fig. 8is a section, corresponding to the section in 
Fig. 6 through the lever in a third embodiment 
example, and Fig. 9is a section along the line IX-IX in Fig. 8. The control lever (hereinafter named lever) according to the 
invention is intended to bring 
about a mechanical change of a mechanism as well as an 
electric activation of a means which either is a part of 
said mechanism or is completely separated from this in 
one and the same movement of the lever. The lever in the

ring-shaped movable 

electrical contact element (14/40/51,52) affixed to the knob 
and arranged to follow it in its movements, and wherein the 

cavity (4) houses an elastic centering element (13) which 
strives to centre the movable contact element relative to the end part 

(10) of the lever part so that in a neutral position for the 
knob the movable contact element has a space (18) to said end part
