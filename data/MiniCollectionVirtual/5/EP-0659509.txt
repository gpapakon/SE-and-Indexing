<ABSTRACT>
In a powder forging process, a heated green compact (10) is 
placed in a stationary die (2) and subjected to a press-forging 

carried out mainly to reduce the thickness thereof by 
cooperation of the stationary die with a movable die (3). The 

press-forging is performed at a pressing step consisting of 
two stages. After placement of the green compact into the 

concave molding portion (7) of the stationary die, the pressing 
step was carried out at each of the stages. Thus, it is 

possible to produce a forged product having a high strength 
and a high toughness. A heated heat insulator also may be 

placed in the stationary die to provide a temperature-retaining 
effect to the green compact before and during 

pressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powder forging
process, and particularly, to a powder forging process in
which a heated green compact is placed into a stationary die
and a press-forging is carried out for mainly reducing the
thickness of the green compact by cooperation of the
stationary die with a movable die.In a powder forging process of this type, a press-forging
consisting of a single-stage pressing step has been commonly
employed. As used in the present specification, the term
"single stage pressing step" means a step where the movable
die is moved in one reciprocation.In carrying out the powder forging process, operations
are required such as removing of the green compact from a
heating device and placing of the green compact into the
stationary die within a period before the start of the press-forging
after heating of the green compact, and for this
reason, the temperature of the green compact drops.To prevent such a drop in the temperature, a process
including a formation of a temperature-retaining coating layer
on a surface of a forging blank has been conventionally
employed (for example, see Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open No. 122142/83).With the prior art press-forging process, however, there
are problems as follows: Particularly when the green compact is formed from a fine
aluminum alloy powder having excellent properties, it is
impossible to sufficiently destroy oxide films on surfaces of
particles of the powder to produce bonding of newly produced
surfaces over the entire green compact. Consequently, it is
difficult to produce a forged product having a high strength
and a high toughness.On the other hand, in the prior art temperature-retained
process, there has been employed a technique in which a liquid
material is applied on the surface of the blank for forming
the coating layer. If this technique is utilized for a green
compact formed of an aluminum alloy powder, the following
problem is encountered: the bonding of the particles of the
aluminum alloy powder does not occur in the heating step,
because of the presence of the oxide films on the surfaces of
the aluminum alloy particles. As a result, the liquid
material is penetrated into pores in the green compact at the
heating step, and the penetrated material remains as foreign
matter in the forged product, resulting in a degraded
bondability of the particles of the aluminum alloy powder to
hinder the densification, thereby failing to produce a forged
product having a high strength and a high toughness. From International
