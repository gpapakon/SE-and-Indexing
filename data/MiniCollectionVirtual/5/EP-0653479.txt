<ABSTRACT>
A first refrigerator oil of the invention has a sodium and/or potassium concentration of 0.1 ppm or less, a low 
hydrolyzability and excellent insulation performance, and hence is useful as a composition for a refrigerator equipped 

with an enclosed compressor. A second refrigerator oil of the invention comprises mainly a carboxylic acid ester of 
pentaerythritol, wherein the carboxylic acid comprises a mixture of 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoic acid with a C₆-C₈ linear 

or branched fatty acid and the content of the trimethylhexanoic acid exceeds 50 mole % but does not exceed 90 
mole %. This oil has a high viscosity and high electrical insulation properties required of refrigerator oils for large 

air-conditioning equipment and a household air conditioner, does not crystallize at low temperature, and is excellent 
in handleability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to refrigerating machine
oils which are used in refrigerating machines using a non-chlorine,
fluorine-containing refrigerant, and which are
excellent in hydrolytic stability and insulating properties
and particularly superior in properties for use in large-sized
air conditioning equipment, room air conditioners and
refrigerators.In refrigerating machines, chlorine-containing
refrigerants, e.g., R11 (CCl3F), R12 (CCl2F2), R123
(CF3CHCl2), R22 (CHClF2), etc., have heretofore been used as
refrigerants. However, development of substitutional Freons
has become a matter of great urgency from the environmental
point of view, and attention has recently been paid to non-chlorine,
fluorine-containing refrigerants, e.g., 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoro
ethane (R134a) and so forth. Consequently, it
has been proposed to employ ester oils, which are excellent
in both compatibility with R134a and thermal stability, as
refrigerating machine oils from the viewpoint of
compatibility with R134a and also from the viewpoint of
thermal stability required for refrigerating machine oils as
a result of the recent achievement of high efficiency of 
refrigerating machines.However, a refrigerating machine oil used in a
refrigerating machine, for example, for a refrigerator
having a hermetic compressor with a motor immersed in the
refrigerating machine oil is required to have a volume
resistivity of 1 x 1013 Ω-cm (25°C) or higher in general
(in the state of being mixed with additives) because there
is a danger of electrical leakage if the electrical
insulating properties are low. In this regard,
conventional refrigerating machine oils for chlorine-containing
refrigerants involve no particular problem
because these oils use a base oil having a relatively high
volume resistivity [1 x 1014 Ω-cm (25°C) or higher], e.g.,
mineral oil, alkylbenzene, etc. However, commercially
available ester oils, which are compatible with non-chlorine,
fluorine-containing refrigerants, generally have a
volume resistivity in the range of from 1 x 1011 Ω-cm to 1
x 1013 Ω-cm (25°C). Particularly, high-viscosity ester
oils whose viscosity is about 70 mm2/s at 40°C have a volume
resistivity as low as 1 x 1012 Ω-cm (25°C). Therefore,
such ester oils give rise to a problem when used as
refrigerating machine oils with non-chlorine, fluorine-containing
refrigerants substituted for chlorine-containing
refrigerants, as described above.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 4-72390
(1992), for example, discloses a refrigerating machine
oi
