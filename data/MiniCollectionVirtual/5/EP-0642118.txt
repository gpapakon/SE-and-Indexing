<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic system for guided
acquisition of telephone line speech signals.In the field of the speech processing, in particular of the automatic
recognition, it is very important to have high-quality databases available.The generation of such databases occurs through long and repeated
recording operations, often carried out in the same conditions as recognition will
have to take place later on. In general a team of speakers is chosen and each
speaker utters at least once the speech elements corresponding to a
predetermined vocabulary (generally words or, less frequently, syllables); the
speech signals corresponding to such utterances are acquired and recorded,
often on special recorders called DAT (Digital Audio Tape).From US patent No. 5,125,022 a method for recognizing alphanumeric
strings is disclosed, that comprises a processing system with a processor, an
interface to telephone network and a database for storing a predetermined set
of alphanumeric strings. In operation the system prompts the caller to speak
characters of a string. Such a method has a very limited application, since it is
intended to detect a code entry, so that that acts only on single characters.Such recognition be realized on speech signals from telephone lines, a
method of getting the speakers to utter such speech elements consists in
calling a telephone subscriber up and asking him to utter the words that an
operator utters in advance one at a time.The object of the present invention is to take such recording operation
easier.This object is achieved through the automatic system for guided
acquisition of telephone line speech signals as set forth in claim 1; further
advantageous aspects of the present invention are set forth in the subclaims. By automating the acquisition process under control of a unique
control unit the work of the operator is made extremely easier.The present invention will result better from the following
description taken in conjunction with the sole attached drawing
that represents a conceptual block diagram of the invention.The automatic system for guided acquisition of speech signals
from a telephone line TR, in accordance with the present
invention, comprises:
a) first storage means M1 designed to contain a plurality of
operator speech messages and provided with a message output
and with a control input for the selection and emission of the
speech messages from said output,b) second storage means M2 designed to store a plurality of user
speech signals and provided with

<CLAIMS>
Automatic system for guided acquisition from a telephone line (TR) of speech
signals, corresponding to a predetermined vocabulary to be used in speech

recognition databases, comprising:

a) first storage means (M1) designed to contain a plurality of operator speech
messages, said messages asking called telephone subscribers to utter

elements of said predetermined vocabulary, and provided with a message
output and a control input for the selection and the emission of speech

message from said output,
b) second storage means (M2) designed to store a plurality of user speech
signals, recorded from the subscriber's answer utterances to said messages,

and provided with a signal input and a control input for storing speech signals,
c) a telephone interface (INT) electrically connected to said telephone-line (TR),
receiving at its input speech messages from said first storage means (M1),

outputting speech signals to said second storage means (M2), and having a
control input for establishing calls to said subscribers, and
d) a control unit (CU) connected with said control inputs and designed to control
the operation of the system.
System according to claim 1, characterized in that said plurality of operator
speech messages is stored into said first storage means (M1) in the form of a

plurality of synthetic speech signals, and said message output of said first
storage means (M1) is connected to an automatic speech synthesizer (SY).
System according to claim 1, characterized in that said telephone interface
(INT) is electrically connected with an operator telephone (TL) and in that said

control input of said telephone interface (INT) is further designed to control the
connection of said telephone line (TR) with said operator line (TL).
System according to claim 1, characterized in that said control unit (CU)
transmits to said telephone interface (INT) information about the subscribers to

be called.
System according to claim 1, characterized in that said second storage
means (M2) are designed to store all the speech signals obtained from said

calls.
