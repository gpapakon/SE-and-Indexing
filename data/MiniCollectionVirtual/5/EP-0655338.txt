<ABSTRACT>
A color thermal printer using an ink sheet having a set 
of three or four colorants coated or printed so as to 

correspond to a print area with sensor marks arranged at 
boundaries between the colorants. In the color thermal 

printer, a plurality of sensors are disposed within a print 
width of a thermal head and downstream from a heat line of the 

thermal head in an ink sheet forward direction by a 
predetermined distance. When the sensors have sensed the 

sensor marks, the ink sheet is rewound by the predetermined 
distance to cause the printing operation to be effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a color thermal printer. Figure 13 is a diagram showing a main portion of a 
construction of a conventional color thermal printer disclosed 
in, e.g., Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho. 64-5879; 
and Figure 14 is a diagram showing an ink sheet. In 
Figures 13 and 14, reference numeral 1 designates a platen; 2, 
a thermal head mounted on a radiating plate 2a and having a 
linearly formed heating body; 3, a print sheet; and 4, an ink 
sheet. The ink sheet 4 is prepared by coating or printing 
three (3) colorants, namely, yellow (Y) 4b, magenta (M) 4c, 
cyan (C) 4d, on a base film 4a in succession so as to 
correspond respectively to a print area. An ink sheet having 
four (4) colorants including black (BK) 4e is also available. 
A head color mark 4f for allowing the head color of each set to 
be sensed and an identification mark (ID mark) 4g for aligning 
each color with a print start position and for identifying the 
type of ink sheet are arranged. The head color mark 4f and the 
ID mark 4g are sensor marks. The head color mark 4f and the ID 
mark 4g, which are sensor marks, are coated with a highly 
light-shielding paint. Reference numeral 5 designates an ink 
sheet feed roll; 6, an ink sheet take-up roll; and 7, a sensor 
for sensing light-shielding at the sensor marks.  
 An operation of the printer will be described next. 
Almost simultaneously with the print sheet 3 having been 
forwarded to the print start position, the ink sheet 4 is also 
forwarded toward the ink sheet take-up roll 6 from the ink 
sheet feed roll 5. At this instance, the head color mark 4f is 
sensed by the sensor 7 and the forwarding of the ink sheet 4 is 
thus stopped. The platen 1 is rotated at a predetermined speed 
by applying an electric signal corresponding to an image to the 
thermal head 2 with the print sheet 3 and the ink sheet 4 
interposed between the platen 1 and the thermal head 2, and 
under this condition, the colorant, yellow 4b, is thermally 
transferred onto the print sheet 3 first. Then, the thermal 
head 2 is moved away from the platen 1 and the print sheet 3 is 
returned to the print start position, and at the same time, the 
ink sheet 4 is forwarded to the next color. The forwarding of 
the ink sheet 4 is stopped when the ID mark 4g has been sensed 
by the sensor 7 in the course of forwarding, and the thermal 
head 2 is caused to abut against the platen 1 to start printing 
the next colorant (magenta 4c) on the print sheet 3. The 
colorants, cyan 4d and black 4e, are
