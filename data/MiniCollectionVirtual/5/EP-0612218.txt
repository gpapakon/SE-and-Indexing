<DESCRIPTION>
The soil microbe Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium
characterized by parasporal crystalline protein inclusions. These often appear microscopically as
distinctively shaped crystals. The proteins are highly toxic to pests and specific in their activity.
Certain B.t. toxin genes have been isolated and sequenced, and recombinant DNA-based B.t.
products produced and approved. In addition, with the use of genetic engineering techniques, new
approaches for delivering B.t. endotoxins to agricultural environments are under development,
including the use of plants genetically engineered with endotoxin genes for insect resistance and
the use of stabilized intact microbial cells as B.t. endotoxin delivery vehicles (Gaertner, F.H., L.
Kim [1988] TIBTECH 6:S4-S7). Thus, isolated B.t. endotoxin genes are becoming commercially
valuable.Bacillus thuringiensis produces a proteinaceous paraspore or crystal which is toxic upon
ingestion by a susceptible insect host. Over most of the past 30 years, commercial use of B.t.
pesticides has been largely restricted to a narrow range of lepidopteran (caterpillar) pests.
Preparations of the spores and crystals of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki have been used for many
years as commercial insecticides for lepidopteran pests. For example, B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki
HD-1 produces a crystal called a delta endotoxin which is toxic to the larvae of a number of
lepidopteran insects.In recent years, however, investigators have discovered B.t. pesticides with specificities for
a much broader range of pests. For example, other species of B.t., namely israelensis and san diego
(a.k.a. B.t. tenebrionis), have been used commercially to control insects of the orders Diptera and
Coleoptera, respectively (Gaertner, F.H. [1989] "Cellular Delivery Systems for Insecticidal
Proteins: Living and Non-Living Microorganisms," in Controlled Delivery of Crop Protection
Agents, R.M. Wilkins, ed., Taylor and Francis, New York and London, 1990, pp. 245-255). See
also Couch, T.L. (1980) "Mosquito Pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis,"
Developments in Industrial Microbiology 22:61-76; Beegle, C.C., (1978) "Use of Entomogenous
Bacteria in Agroecosystems," Developments in Industrial Microbiology 20:97-104. Krieg, A., A.M.
Huger, G.A. Langenbruch, W. Schnetter (1983) Z. ang. Ent. 96:500-508, describe a B.t. isolate 
named Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis, which is reportedly active against two beetles in the
order Coleoptera. These are the
