<ABSTRACT>
Polar thermoplastic polyolefin blends are provided which are flexible and are particularly useful in replacing polyvinyl chloride sheeting used as liners, folders, etc. The blends comprise, in general, a non-polar thermoplastic polyolefin, a polar ethylene copolymer, and an acid grafted olefin polymer as a compatibilizing agent, all of which are chlorine-free.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyolefin compositions and more 
particularly to such compositions which are flexible and polar, and 
to shaped articles made from them. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets have been on the market for 
many years and have been the standard liner material in the 
housing industry. PVC sheets are characterized by being flexible 
over a variable temperature range, heat-sealable, and oil-resistant. 
However, with the trend toward a chlorine-free 
environment, there is a need for a PVC sheeting alternative. 
Ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM) rubbers are 
alternatives, but these are difficult to seal. Thus, there is a need 
for PVC-free sheets which are thermoplastic and heat-sealable, 
halogen-free and flexible. According to the present invention there is provided a flexible, 
non-halogen-containing polymer composition which comprises a 
blend of:  
 
(a) 35-96% by weight of a non-polar thermoplastic polyolefin; (b) 3-50% by weight of a polar ethylene copolymer which 
comprises: 
(i) 30-80% by weight of ethylene; (ii) 5-60% by weight of at least one copolymerizable, 
ethylenically unsaturated organic compound; and (iii) 3-30% by weight of carbon monoxide; and (c) 1-30% by weight of a compatibilizing agent which is a 
carboxylic acid or derivative thereof grafted olefin polymer. The invention relates to flexible, non-halogen containing 
thermoplastic polymer blends which are useful in sheet form as 
liners for roofing or for making folders, and in film form as 
packaging films. These blends generally are formed by combining 
a non-polar thermoplastic polyolefin and a soft, polar 
thermoplastic ethylene copolymer. A compatibilizing agent is 
required in order to affect the blend. Such polymer blends can be 
formed into sheets, films, and other shaped articles which have 
many properties comparable to polyvinyl chloride (PVC), but with 
better elongation and with no chlorine. The term "non-polar thermoplastic polyolefin" means any 
polyolefin polymer which is thermoplastic but which excludes 
polar ethylene copolymers as defined herein. In general, these 
polyolefins will have a melt flow index (MFI) in the range of 0.01-100 
g/10 min., preferably less than 5 g/10 min. as determined by 
ASTM D-1238 (measured at 2,16 kg and 190째C or 230째C 
depending on the polyolefin used). Useful polyolefins are high 
density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene. Other polyolefin  
 
homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene can be utilized in the 
practice of this invention. Such other polyolefins
