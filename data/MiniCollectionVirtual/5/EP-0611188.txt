<ABSTRACT>
A punching die includes a punch body and a punch head 
provided for an upper portion of the punch body. The punch 

head is struck by a striker. The punching die further 
includes a punch guide disposed at a lower portion of the 

punch body, a retainer collar disposed over the punch guide 
and fitted to the punch body, a stripping spring interposed 

between the punch head and the retainer collar, and an 
elastically deformable damping member being interposed between 

an upper surface of the punch guide and a lower surface of the 
retainer collar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punching die according 
to the preamble of claim 1 (see for example EP-A-0 000 762), and more 
specifically to a punching die which can prevent punching 
noise generated during punching processing of work. Generally, the punching processing is effected by 
moving up and down an upper die against work placed on a lower 
die. Therefore, whenever the work is punched out, punching 
noise is inevitably generated. In order to prevent the 
generation of the punching noise, generally a damping 
material such as urethane has been provided at the bottom 
portion of a punch guide for constituting a part of the upper 
die. In the general way of providing a damping material 
such as urethane at the bottom portion of the punch guide, 
however, there exists a problem in that needle-shaped dust or 
refuse is inevitably produced during punching processing and 
further adheres onto the damping material or scratches the 
surface of the work to be punched out. In addition, there 
exist other problems in that the damping material is short in 
life time and difficult to be mounted at the bottom of the 
punching die. With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the primary 
object of the present invention to provide a punching die  
 
provided with a damping member excellent in punching noise 
prevention performance, long in life time, and easy to be 
mounted on the punching die. To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present 
invention provides a punching die includes a punch body and a 
punch head provided for an upper portion of the punch body. 
The punch head is struck by a striker. The punching die 
further includes a punch guide disposed at a lower portion of 
the punch body, a retainer collar disposed over the punch 
guide and fitted to the punch body, a stripping spring 
interposed between the punch head and the retainer collar. The 
punching die according to the present invention is characterised in 
that 
an elastically deformable damping member is interposed 
between an upper surface of said punch guide and a lower 
surface of said retainer collar. Further, it is preferable that the damping member is 
interposed in a first part of a space between the upper 
surface of the punch guide and the lower surface of the 
retainer collar, and is not interposed in other second part of 
the space. In the punching die according to the present invention, 
when the striker strikes the punch head, the punch guide 
first collides against the work. The shock generated when the 
punch guide

<CLAIMS>
A punching die comprising: 

a punch body (19); 
a punch head (27) provided for an upper portion of said punch 
body (19), said punch head (27) struck by a striker(45); 
a punch guide (15) disposed at a lower portion of said punch 
body (19); 
a retainer collar (31) disposed over said punch guide (15) and fitted 
to said punch body (19); 
a stripping spring (33) interposed between said punch head (27) and 
said retainer collar (31); characterised in that 
an elastically deformable damping member (37) is interposed 
between an upper surface (51) of said punch guide (15) and a lower 

surface (52) of said retainer collar (31). 
The punching die according claim 1, wherein:
 
   said damping member (37) is interposed in a first part (53) of a space (54) 

between said upper surface (51) of said punch guide (15) and said lower 
surface (52) of said retainer collar (31), and is not interposed in 

other second part (55) of said space (54). 
The punching die according claim 2, wherein:
 
   a distance (C) between said upper surface (51) and said lower 

surface (52) in said first part (53) is longer than a distance (D) 
between said upper surface (51) and lower surface (52) in said second 

part (55), in said second part (55) said upper surface (51) is aparted from 
said lower surface (52) when said punch head (27) is not struck by said 

striker (45).
