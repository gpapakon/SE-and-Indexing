<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuous process for the preparation of perfluoroalkyl iodides by gas phase thermal telomerisation of tetrafluoroethylene with pentafluoroethyl or heptafluoroisopropyl iodide in a tubular reactor. In order to improve the selectivity for a telomer of the desired degree of polymerisation, telomers of a lower degree of polymerisation are recycled into at least one point of the reactor situated between a twentieth and three-quarters of the length of the tube.

Continuous process for the preparation of 
perfluoroalkyl iodides RfI, Rf denoting a perfluoroalkyl 

radical which is linear and contains from 6 to 12 carbon 
atoms or is branched and contains from 7 to 13 carbon 

atoms, by thermal telomerization, in the gas phase in a 
tubular reactor, of tetrafluoroethylene with 

pentafluoroethyl iodide or heptafluoroisopropyl iodide 
(i=0) or with a lower telomer (i=1 to 3), characterized 

in that the telomers of extent i+1 to j-1, j denoting the 
extent of the desired telomer, are recycled to at least 

one point of the reactor which is situated between one-twentieth 
and three-quarters the length of the tube. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the 
telomers of extent i+1 to j-1 are recycled to at least 

one point of the tube which is situated between one-fifth 
and two-fifths of its length. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in 
which the telomers of extent i+1 to j-1 are recycled to 

different points of the reactor, the lighter telomers in 
an upstream zone of the reactor and the heavier ones in 

a downstream zone. 
Process according to Claim 3, in which the 
upstream zone is situated between one-twentieth and one-third 

of the length of the tube and the downstream zone 
is situated between one-fifth and half the length of the 

tube. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
in which the ratio of length to internal diameter of the 

tubular reactor is between 50 and 5,000.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
in which telomerization is carried out at a temperature 

ranging from 300 to 360°C, preferably between about 325 
and 355°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
in which the molar ratio of fresh telogen to fresh C

F
4
 is 
between 0.1 and 0.6, preferably between 0.2 and 0.5. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
in which one portion of the tetrafluoroethylene is 

injected at at least one point of the reactor which is 
situated between two-fifths and three-quarters the length 

of the tube, the remainder being introduced at the head 
of the reactor at the same time as the starting telogen. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
in which the feeding of the reactor with fresh and/or 

recycled reactants is regulated such that, in steady-state 
operation, the quantities of telomer of extent i+1 

entering and leaving the reactor are substantially 
identical. 
Application of the process according to 
one of Claims 1 to 9 to the production of perfluorooctyl 

iodide C
