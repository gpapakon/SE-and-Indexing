<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hardenable 
composition, and coatings and laminates prepared 
therefrom. U.S. Patent No. 4,226,910 discloses an energy 
control sheet comprising in contiguous order i) a 
transparent polymeric support foil which has low 
transmission and high absorption properties with 
respect to infra-red energy; ii) a metal layer; and 
iii) a protective polymeric layer such as a polyolefin 
film to protect the metal layer. In col. 9, line 63 to 
col. 10, line 3, there is contemplated application of a 
coating to the exposed surface of the protective 
polymeric layer to enhance the abrasion-resistance of 
the energy control sheet. However, there is no 
disclosure of any specific coating. U.S. Patent No. 4,557,980 discloses a 
radiation curable coating for a metal or non-metal 
substrate. Emphasized are metallized films used for 
energy control. The coating comprises i) a 
triacrylate or tetracrylate; and ii) acrylic acid. U.S. Patent No. 4,249,011 discloses 
photocurable compositions comprising hydantoin 
hexacrylate useful for providing solvent and abrasion 
resistant coatings. The present invention provides a novel 
laminate comprising a polyolefin film having first and 
second major surfaces and having adhered to the first 
major surface a hardened coating which is a  
 
photopolymerization reaction product of starting 
materials comprising hydantoin hexacrylate and a 
surfactant of the formula (I) 
 
wherein 
R1 is a perfluoro alkyl group of 4 to 12 
carbon atoms; R2 is an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; R3 is a divalent, saturated hydrocarbon group of 2 to 
4 carbon atoms with at least 2 carbon atoms 
separating the adjacent N and O atoms; R4 is a divalent, saturated hydrocarbon group of 2 to 
4 carbon atoms with at least 2 carbon atoms 
separating the adjacent 0 atoms; R5 is hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms; and n is an average index from 1 to about 12. The present invention further provides an 
energy control sheet comprising the above laminate in 
combination with a transparent polymeric support foil 
having low transmission and high absorption properties 
with respect to infra-red energy and a transparent-reflective 
metal layer bonded to one surface of the 
transparent polymeric support foil. The exposed 
surface of the polyolefin film is bonded to the metal 
layer in such a construction to provide an energy 
control film exhibiting desirable properties. The present invention still further provides 
a photohardenable composition for preparing an 
abrasion-resi
