Process for manufacturing a pressure-difference 
sensor having a silicon measuring diaphragm (12) 

that is clamped between two discoid support 
elements made of glass (13, 14), each forming an 

inner chamber (20, 21), the one inner chamber being 
able to be pressurised by one pressure via a 

through-hole in the one support element, and the 
other inner chamber being able to be pressurised by 

another pressure of the pressure-difference to be 
measured,
characterised in that
prior to the clamping of the silicon measuring 
diaphragm (12), at least the additional 

support element (14) delimiting the other 
inner chamber (21) is provided with a recess 

(18) with inclined sides (33) having a very 
slight gradient, 


by depositing a thin layer (4) on the 
surface regions of the discoid support 

element (14) in accordance with the 
inclined sides (33) to be produced, said 

thin layer (4) being removable by an 
isotropic etchant, 
the thin layer is then covered by an 
etching mask (5) which cannot be attacked 

by the isotropic etchant, and 
after which the isotropic etching is 
carried out. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that 


the thin layer is made from titanium having a 
thickness of approximately 50 nm and 
the etching mask is formed from gold. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that 


the thickness of the thin layer (4) and its 
material is selected according to the required 

gradient of the inclined side (9).
