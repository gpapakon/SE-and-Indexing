<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gallium nitride-based III-V Group compound semiconductor device, and a
method of producing the same.In recent years, a great deal of attention has been directed to light-emitting devices utilizing gallium nitride-based
III-V Group semiconductors such as GaN, GaAIN, InGaN, and InAlGaN. Such a light-emitting device has a structure
in which a layer of an n-type gallium nitride-based III-V Group compound semiconductor, and a layer of a gallium
nitride-based III-V Group compound semiconductor doped with a p-type dopant are stacked on a substrate.In the prior art, the layer of the gallium nitride-based III-V Group compound semiconductor doped with a p-type
dopant remains as of high resistivity i-type. Therefore, the prior art device is of a so-called MIS structure. Recently,
techniques to convert the high resistivity i-type compound semiconductor layer into a p-type layer has been disclosed
in JP-A-2-257679, JP-A-3-218325, and JP-A-5-183189, and thus, it has now become possible to realize p-n junction
type gallium nitride-based III-V Group semiconductor light-emitting devices, for example.As such a p-n junction type gallium nitride-based III-V Group semiconductor devices have been being developed,
it has become apparent that an electrode that is formed in direct contact with the p-type semiconductor layer or
the n-type semiconductor layer has been encountered with various problems.Presently, p-n junction type gallium nitride-based III-V Group semiconductor devices have a p-type compound
semiconductor layer as the uppermost semiconductor layer due to the restriction imposed on the production
thereof. Further, a transparent sapphire substrate is usually used for such a device. Different from a semiconductive
substrate used for the other semiconductor light-emitting device, sapphire is electrically insulative. Thus, it is not possible
to mount, directly on the substrate, electrodes for supplying a predetermined current to the compound semiconductor
layer to cause the device to emit light. A p-electrode and n-electrode must be formed in direct contact with the p-type
compound semiconductor layer and the n-type compound semiconductor layer, respectively. The p-electrode is usually
formed to cover substantially entire surface of the p-type compound semiconductor layer in order to ensure the uniform
application of current to the entire p-type compound semiconductor layer, thereby obtaining uniform light emission from
the device. However, since the prior art p-electrode is not
