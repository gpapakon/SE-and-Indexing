<ABSTRACT>
Process for incineration and vitrification of chiefly inorganic waste in which at least one plasma jet (16) of pure or substantially pure oxygen is employed for melting the waste. The crucible (1) is made of metal whose wall is cooled by liquids circulating in internal channels (13). A drainage valve (10) exists at the bottom.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the incineration and vitrification of mineral and/or organic
waste in a stationary crucible by means of a plasma torch (5, 22), characterized

in that it consists of using at least one torch (5, 22) with a
substantially pure oxygen plasma (16) in said stationary crucible having a

stainless steel wall (1) provided with outflow channels (13) for a cooling
liquid and a tapping valve (10) and in that the plasma is of the arc plasma

type transferred through a molten glass bath (11) in which the electric
currents are "wrapped round".
Process for the incineration and vitrification of mineral and/or organic
waste according to claim 1, characterized in that the oxygen plasma is mixed

with a neutral gas stream, the striking of the arc between the torch (5, 22)
and the electrode (4) at the bottom of the crucible being carried out using

the neutral gas only, the oxygen being progressively substituted for part
of the neutral gas in order to obtain normal operation.
Process for the incineration and vitrification of mineral and/or organic
waste according to claim 1, characterized in that the wall (1) is raised to

a temperature below the solidification point of the vitrified waste and
above the condensation point of the corrosive vapours given off.
Process for the incineration and vitrification of mineral and/or organic
waste according to claim 1, characterized in that the oxygen plasma is mixed

with a neutral gas stream.
Process for the incineration and vitrification of mineral and/or organic
waste according to claim 4, characterized in that the neutral gas is blown

through openings (24) made in the wall (1).
