<ABSTRACT>
Hair is conditioned by applying to the hair an 
effective amount of a composition which includes as the hair 

conditioning agent, from 0.5 to 5.0 percent by weight of a 
derivatized amine functional organosilicon compound which is 

one of (i) a reaction product of an amine functional 
polysiloxane and a derivative of carbonic acid; (ii) a 

reaction product of an amine functional polysiloxane and a 
lactone; (iii) a reaction product of an amine functional 

silane and a derivative of carbonic acid; or (iv) a reaction 
product of an amine functional silane and a lactone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to certain derivatized 
amine functional organosilicon compounds which have been 
found to possess the capability of imparting conditioning 
benefits to the hair. While the reaction products of Examples 1-6 are 
described in U.S. Patent 5,174,813 issued December 29, 1992, 
the '813 patent does not teach their use as conditioning 
agents for the treatment of human hair. Rather, the '813 
patent is directed to polish formulations for application to 
motor vehicles, boats, navigable crafts, wood surfaces, 
plastic surfaces and fiber surfaces. Such formulations 
contain abrasive materials; toxic solvents such as naphtha, 
Stoddard solvent, mineral spirits and kerosene; and 
corrosion inhibitors; which would certainly not suggest 
their use in applications intended for the care and 
maintenance of the human body. Hair preparations are compositions which are 
employed on the scalp or hair. The most important hair 
preparations are shampoos, conditioning products, colorants, 
hairstyling preparations including setting lotions and 
hairsprays and permanent wave preparations. Shampoos are mild cosmetic products for cleaning 
the hair and scalp. Hair becomes soiled due to skin flakes, 
sebum, perspiration, dust and residues from sprays, lotions 
and conditioning agents. Shampoos are designed to leave the 
hair clean, pliable, lustrous, possessing a pleasant odor 
and easy to untangle, comb, manage and style. The principal ingredient of a shampoo is a 
surfactant which functions to release dirt from the hair and 
to transport it to the aqueous medium. Since consumers 
equate lathering with cleanliness, anionic surfactants such  
 
as alkyl sulfates and sulfonates are preferred because of 
their high lather. Numerous other constituents are included 
in shampoos such as thickeners to prevent the shampoo from 
running down the face into the eyes, opacifiers to provide a 
rich pleasing pearlescent appearance, buffers to adjust the 
pH of the shampoo to a value which is gentle to the skin, 
and fragrances to impart a pleasant aroma to the washed hair 
following rinsing. Most frequently, shampoos are marketed 
as clear products although gels having a higher viscosity 
and packaged in tubes and pearlescent compositions are 
available. With the advent of consumer trends toward daily 
hair washing, conditioning shampoos have emerged which are 
designed to render the hair easy to comb and tangle free in 
the wet state, as well as glossy and soft when dry. Such 
conditioning is provided by cationic
