<ABSTRACT>
The flat milling tool has a tool holder and at least one milling turning plate arranged at 45 deg. which is arranged in a swarf chamber open in the rotary direction in the tool holder, which has a plate seat. A screw is provided which screws into a threaded bore in the plate seat for fixture of the milling turning plate via a central hole. The milling turning plate has swarf troughs on the cutting edges. The turning plate (14) together with the plate seat is so formed that a negative radial angle (W2) of the plate seat, a negative axial angle of the plate seat and a positive effect swarf angle (W3), pref. of 15 deg. results.

<CLAIMS>
A face-milling cutter including a tool holder and at least one indexable 
milling insert mounted in a 45째 assembly, which indexable milling insert is disposed 

in a chip chamber of the tool holder which includes an insert seat and is open in the 
direction of rotation, and a bolt adapted to be screwed into a threaded bore within 

the insert seat for fixing the indexable milling insert by means of a central hole, the 
indexable milling insert including chip grooves along the cutting edges, characterized 

in that the indexable milling insert (14) along with the insert seat is arranged such 
that a negative radial angle (W2) of the insert seat, a negative axial angle (W1) of 

the insert seat and a positive effective rake angle (W
o
) each are 12 to 18째, preferably 
15째. 
A face-milling cutter according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
plane support surface (22) of the indexable milling insert (14a) and the plane flank 

surface include an angle of about 90째. 
A face-milling cutter according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in 
that the indexable milling insert includes a central hole (18) for being mounted by 

means of a threaded bolt which engages into a threaded bore (20) of the tool holder 
(12).
