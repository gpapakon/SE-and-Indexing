<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to optoelectronic switching apparatus, 
and more particularly, to an optoelectronic multibit switching apparatus that may be 
used in beamsteering applications. The present invention provides an improvement of an optoelectronic switch 
designed for beamsteering applications that is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,109,449, 
assigned to the assignee of the present invention. This patent discloses a variable 
optical delay line that is employed with a laser transmitter, an optoelectronic switch, and 
an analog variable delay line to provide a controllable delay path for applied RF energy 
transmitted or received by an active array of antenna elements. The variable optical 
delay line comprises a input optical fiber that transmits an RF modulated optical signal 
to a plurality of output optical fibers. Each output fiber has a different length that 
determines the propagation delay of the modulated optical signal therethrough. The 
optoelectronic switch is responsive to the optical energy provided by a selected one of 
the second fibers. The switch detects the delayed optical energy and couples it to the 
analog variable delay line, and thereafter to a selected antenna element of the array, for 
example. The optoelectronic switch of U.S. Patent No. 5,109,449 has greater loss and/or 
greater complexity than is desirable for some applications because it uses only one type 
of switching apparatus; either laser switches or photodiode detector switches. For true-time-delay 
beamsteering, this requires a larger number of cascaded stages than is 
desirable for some applications to achieve a given number of delays.  The need for reconfigurable high speed circuits and in true-time-delay beamsteering 
for active arrays is recognized for both military and commercial applications. 
The use of fiber optics for many types of applications is expected to increase in the 
future. Thus, as the use of fiber optics increases, the need for circuits that can 
optimally reconfigure electronic circuits and provide usable delays for beamsteering 
will also increase. The present invention is designed to meet these needs. Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an improved 
optoelectronic switching apparatus. It is another objective of the present invention to 
provide an improved optoelectronic switching apparatus that may be used for multibit 
beemsteering applications. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide 
an optoelectronic switching apparatus
