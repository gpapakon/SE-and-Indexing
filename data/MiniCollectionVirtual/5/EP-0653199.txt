<ABSTRACT>
A metal composite and method for filling a dental cavity 
independent of cavity size. The dental metal composite comprises high-fusing 

temperature particles, low-fusing temperature particles, and a wax binder, 
and is inserted into the cavity to replicate the cavity, removed for heat 

treatment, densified, and reinserted to complete the filling operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metal composite and method for 
filling a dental cavity in the preparation of a dental restoration. Historically, a cavity in a vital tooth has been filled using either 
a gold filling or an amalgam of silver and mercury. Concern over the potential 
health hazard from the use of mercury in dental fillings has created a need 
for a substitute dental filling material and/or method for filling teeth using a 
filling material which does not contain mercury. Ceramic materials and 
composites have been investigated and are, to a limited extent, currently 
used as a substitute for the mercury amalgam. The ceramic materials do not, 
however, form as durable or as strong a filling in comparison to a mercury 
amalgam or a gold-based metal filling. For larger cavities, an inlay, partial 
veneer or full veneer is usually indicated, and is almost exclusively fabricated 
with metal. At present, the inlay preparation requires laboratory involvement 
similar to the effort and expense in making a full crown. The procedure currently practiced for preparing an inlay, onlay, 
or veneer requires careful cavity preparation, followed by taking an 
impression of the cavity which is then forwarded to a dental laboratory to 
prepare a casting in much the same manner as in the preparation of a full 
crown. The inlay or onlay may also result in an unsightly exhibition of metal  
 
since it is difficult to form a coating of porcelain for application to only a 
specific area or surface. Moreover, the inlay may fit poorly if the casting does 
not accurately reproduce the anatomical contour of the cavity. A metal composite has been discovered in accordance with the 
present invention suitable as a substitute for the mercury amalgam in filling 
a dental cavity, and preferably in accordance with a novel direct-indirect filling 
technique, which permits the metal composite to be used as a universal filling 
material for small or large cavities, including the preparation of inlays, onlays, 
or a veneer. The metal composite of the present invention is, preferably, 
inserted directly into the dental cavity to form a replica of the anatomical 
contour of the cavity. Upon removal from the cavity, the composite is heat 
treated to form a porous metal sponge which is then filled with a filler 
material to form a solid structure having the shape of the dental cavity, and 
reinserted into the dental cavity to complete the filling operation. Broadly, the method of the present invention is a direct-indirect 
technique

<CLAIMS>
A direct-indirect method for filling a dental cavity in a 
vital or nonvital tooth within the mouth of a dental patient, comprising the 

steps of: 
   forming a metal composite comprising particles of a high-fusing 

temperature metal, particles of a low-fusing temperature metal, and a binder 
substantially of wax in a concentration of at least thirty percent (30%) by 

volume of said composite; 
   inserting the metal composite in situ, into the dental cavity; 

   compacting the composite in the cavity to form a shaped 
composite conforming to the anatomical contour of the cavity; 

   removing the shaped composite from the cavity; 
   heat treating the shaped composite at a temperature below the 

melting temperature of the high-fusing temperature metal particles, to volatize 
said wax and to form a porous metal sponge having a void volume of above 

at least thirty percent (30%); 
   adding a filler material into the porous metal sponge to fill the 

voids for forming a solidified structure; and 
   cementing the solidified structure into the dental cavity to 

complete the filling operation. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 1, further 
comprising inserting a member into said composite to facilitate its removal 

from the cavity. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 2, wherein 
said member is composed of metal. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 3, wherein 
said metal member has a protruding shoulder to facilitate removal of the 

shaped composite from the cavity. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 2, wherein 
said binder includes additives selected from the group consisting of: 

elastomer(s), gum(s), synthetic rubber, self-hardening plastic(s) and 
photopolymerizable materials. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 2, wherein 
a photopolymerizable material is applied to the occlusal surface of said 

shaped composite to form a hard coating upon application of light energy. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 2, wherein 
said shaped composite is heat treated at a temperature between 800°C and 

1200°C. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 7, wherein 
said shaped composite is heat treated in refractory investment material. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 7, wherein 
said shaped composite is heat treated as a free-standing body. 
A direct-indirect method, as defined in claim 2, wherein 
said filler material comprises a material selected from the group consisting 

of metal, ceramic, or plastic. 
A dental composite for use as a dental kit in filling a 
dental cavity, comprising a first dental material composition composed of 

particles of a high-fusing temperature metal of irregular shape, particles of 
a low-fusing temperature metal, and a binder composed substantially of wax 

in a concentration of at least about thirty percent (30%) by volume of said 
dental material, and a second material having a melting temperature below 

the melting temperature of said high-fusing temperature metal particles and 
selected from the group consisting of precious metals, ceramics, and 

plastics, for filling the voids in said first dental material formed upon heat 
treatment at a temperature substantially equal to the melting temperature of 

said low-fusing temperature metal. 
A dental composite, as defined in claim 11, wherein said 
high- and low-fusing temperature metal particles vary in a size range of
