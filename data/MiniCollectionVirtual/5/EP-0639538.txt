<ABSTRACT>
Method of forming a permanently elastic adhesive bond, which is easily detachable in the case of demounting, in particular comprising temperature-resistant silicone bonds, between a sheet of glass, glass ceramic or a similar material, in particular between a cooking surface in a recess of a working surface, and a sealing frame arranged in the recess and resting on the edge of the latter as a support, and a retaining frame which is connected to the sealing frame and on which the sheet rests, the bonding strength between the permanently elastic adhesive bond and the parts of the sheet in contact therewith being adjusted by release agents.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the formation of a permanently 
elastic adhesive bond, which can easily be broken in 

the event of disassembly, between a glass or glass-ceramic 
plate (1) and both a sealing frame (2), which 

is arranged in a recess and rests on the edge thereof 
as support, and a holding frame (2a), which is 

connected to the sealing frame and on which the plate 
rests, where the adhesive strength of the adhesive bond 

is adjusted by means of release means (3), 
characterized in that the release means between the 

adhesive bond (4) and the plate parts in contact 
therewith are applied in the edge region of the plate 

to its underside and optionally also to the lower 
region of the plate faces which are in contact with the 

adhesive bond. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the release means are applied partially to the 

underside of the plate. 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the release means used are the 

underside coating applied to the plate, in particular 
as scattered-light mask, in particular a layer based on 

a resinate. 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the release means provided are 

release films, in particular self-adhesive, heat-resistant 
acrylate films.  

 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the release means employed are 

silicone release agents, waxes, oils, fats, resins, 
paints, surfactants, alcohols, drying agents, pigments, 

fibres, polyolefins or soaps, in particular as 2 to 5% 
strength by weight soap solution. 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the release means applied is a 

paint, in particular an oil paint, which guarantees a 
conventional, non-reduced adhesive strength between the 

permanently elastic adhesive bond and the plate parts 
in contact therewith up to the maximum service 

temperature of the adhesive bond, in particular up to 
180°C, but changes its properties at temperatures above 

the maximum service temperature, in particular above 
300°C, in such a way that adhesion is no longer 

promoted. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the permanently elastic adhesive 

bond is formed by a heat-resistant silicone compound. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the glass or glass-ceramic plate 

is a cooking hob in a recess of a worktop.
