<ABSTRACT>
The system for cascading data switches in a communication 
node allows to transfer data information among a plurality 

of adapters (30-i), expanding a moderate low cost switch 
31-1 with additional hardware (31-2, 31-3, 31-4) to inter-connect 

more adapters. The data information transfers are 
performed thanks a plurality of Burst Relaying Cascaders 

(32-i) which connect the plurality of switches (31-i). A 
similar interface connect each adapter to the switch. A 

set of address information is used by the system to route 
the data information from the source adapter to the target 

adapter, allowing the navigation among the intermediate 
switches.

 
Each interface contains a table where the address of every 

adapter of the whole system could be constructed dynamically 
at each communication node configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switching system for a 
communication node transferring data among a plurality of 
data processing units or network links and more particularly 
to a modular switching system capable of being expanded 
to interconnect additional data processors or network 
links. The trend in modern data processing systems is towards 
large networks of data processors which exchange data 
among them and a central data processor to perform a variety 
of data processing operations. The data processors may 
be arranged in local networks linked to the central data 
processor. The central data processor controls the exchange 
of data through various circuitries including a 
switch which actually interconnects any data processor 
wishing to send data to another data processor with said 
other data processor under control of a switch control 
logic (scheduler). An example of a switching system, which is described in 
the European Patent application published with the no. EP 
387,464, comprises data switching means which are connected 
to each one of the N data processing units through a 
receive data bus and a transmit data bus. Each data processing 
unit comprises a set of outbound queues with one 
outbound queue associated with each one of the data processing 
units to which it may send data bursts for storing 
the data packets to be sent by the data processing unit to  
 
the data processing unit associated with said outbound 
queue. The packet switching is controlled by a switch 
control logic which runs a switching algorithm. The number of data processors that can be interconnected 
by a data switch is subject to limitations mainly due to 
the limited size of hardware logic that can be implemented 
on a single switch control chip and the limited number of 
I/O lines which can be implemented on a single chip for 
the actual data switching. To overcome the above problems, 
many data switch chips could be used but this would not be 
satisfactory since the limitation on the number of cells 
of the switch control chip could become predominant and 
the increased number of data switch chips could become a 
problem at the card design level. An object of the present invention is to provide a switching 
system allowing a plurality of data processing units 
or network links to be interconnected with moderate size 
and low cost switch which can later on be expanded with 
additional hardware to interconnect more data processors 
and network links. This avoids the use of a large, expensive 
switch
