Preferably, the copper and lithium components are controlled such that the combined copper and lithium content are kept below the solubility limit to avoid loss of fracture toughness during elevated temperature exposure. The relationship between the copper and lithium contents also should meet the following relationship: Cu (wt.%) + 1.5 Li (wt.%)

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation -in-part application of
United States Serial No. 07/699,540 filed on May 14, 1991.This invention relates to an improved aluminum lithium alloy
and more particularly relates to an aluminum lithium alloy which
contains copper, magnesium and silver and is characterized as a
low density alloy capable of maintaining an acceptable level of
fracture toughness and high strength when subjected to elevated
temperatures for long duration in aircraft and aerospace
applications.In the aircraft industry, it has been generally recognized
that one of the most effective ways to reduce the weight of an
aircraft is to reduce the density of the aluminum alloys used in
the aircraft construction. For purposes of reducing the alloy
density, lithium additions have been made. However, the addition
of lithium to aluminum alloys is not without problems. For
example, the addition of lithium to aluminum alloys often results
in a decrease in ductility and fracture toughness. Where the use
is in aircraft parts, it is imperative that the lithium containing
alloy have improved ductility, fracture toughness, and strength
properties.A lightweight and high strength alloy has been described in
Japanese patent JP-A-2,274,835. The alloy described in this
document is an Al-Li-Ag alloy having improved workability and
elongation and having furthermore improved strength and elongation
by aging treatment after superplastic forming by incorporating
specific amounts of Ag into an Al-Li-series alloy.With respect to conventional alloys, both high strength and
high fracture toughness appear to be quite difficult to obtain
when viewed in light of conventional alloys such as AA (Aluminum
Association) 2024-T3X and 7050-T7X normally used in aircraft
applications. For example, it was found for AA2024 sheet that
toughness decreases as strength increases. Also, it was found 
that the same is true of AA7050 plate. More desirable alloys
would permit increased strength with only minimal or no decrease
in toughness or would permit processing steps wherein the
toughness was controlled as the strength was increased in order
to provide a more desirable combination of strength and
toughness. Additionally, in more desirable alloys, the
combination of strength and toughness would be attainable in an
aluminum-lithium alloy having density reductions in the order of
5 to 15%. Such alloys would find widespread use in the aerospace
industry where low weight and high strength and toughness
translate to high fuel savings. Thus, it will be
