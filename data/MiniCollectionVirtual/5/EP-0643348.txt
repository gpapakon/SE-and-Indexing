<ABSTRACT>
A computer systems which combines the 
capabilities of both notepad and notebook computers. 

The main housing includes an LCD display with a 
digitizer input to be used as the display in all 

modes and the input device when used with a stylus 
in notepad mode. Also located in the main housing 

are a floppy disk drive, a hard disk drive, an 
optional modem unit, batteries, and the electronics 

of the computer. The main housing contains a 
recessed portion for receiving a detachable 

keyboard. The keyboard includes a pivoting, mating 
extension which is received in the recess so that 

the keyboard is retained in the recess during 
storage conditions and in some cases of use, where 

the housing acts as a partial keyboard support to 
allow angling of the keyboard. The keyboard 

contains pivoting legs so that the keyboard can be 
used remotely from the main housing and yet be 

angled. The main housing contains a pivoting 
portion which can operate as a stand when the 

computer is being operated with the keyboard, so 
that the display is properly angled for viewing by 

the user. The pivoting portion can also be pivoted 
to a position generally parallel with the main 

housing, but having a portion extending past the 
housing to act as a handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to portable computer 
systems, and more particularly to a computer system 
which can function as a notepad computer and 
includes provisions for receiving and storing a 
keyboard to operate as a notebook computer. Portable computer systems are becoming more 
powerful, smaller and lighter with each few months. 
Notebook computers have been available for some 
time. They are generally about 8 1/2 x 11 inches in 
width and length and 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. They 
include an liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, a 
keyboard, a floppy disk and/or hard disk and various 
other ports and items standard on desktop computers. 
Typically they weigh from 5 to 9 pounds, including 
batteries. Data input and application interaction 
is generally accomplished by using the keyboard. 
One problem has been the need to learn to type to 
efficiently operate the system and the need of a 
stable location for the computer when you must type. 
However, keyboard input is often very precise, so  
 
that complicated commands can be entered without 
numerous errors. One newer arrival in the class of portable 
computer systems is the slate or notepad computer. 
In this type of computer a stylus is used to write 
directly on the LCD screen used in the unit. A 
digitizer captures the movements of the stylus and 
software in the computer converts the movement to 
commands, either by monitoring location when the 
system is being used in a touch screen-like mode, or 
by converting the movements into specific 
characters, which then form the command or data. 
Thus there is no reason to learn to type. By using 
the computer as a notepad, no resting space is 
required for operation of the unit. However, very 
specialized software is required, the processing may 
be slow, characters may be misinterpreted and 
various other problems may occur. One advantage of 
a notepad is that the unit may be very small. One problem is that computers are built to be 
either notepads, and not use a keyboard, or as 
notebooks, which require use of the keyboard. Thus 
there is no crossover and a user is forced to select 
or spend significantly more money to obtain both 
units. Computer systems according to the present 
invention combine the capabilities of both notepad 
and notebook computers. The main components of the 
computer are organized to operate as a notepad  
 
computer, but provisions are made for the storage 
and connection of a keyboard so that typed data 
entry is also available. The main assembly is that of a notepad 
comput

A combined notebook and notepad computer 
comprising: 

   a main housing having a generally 
rectangular parallelepiped shape and having a 

rectangular opening;
