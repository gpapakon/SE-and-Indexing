R
can be identical or different and is a monovalent 
organic radical and 
R¹
is an alkyl radical, 
 
and at least one silane of the formula
Si(OR²)₄   (II)

 
and/or partial hydrolysate thereof, in which 


R²
can be identical or different and is an alkyl radical, 
 
and if appropriate an organosilicon compound chosen from 

the group consisting of silanes of the formula
R³
a
Si(OR⁴)
4-a
   (III)

 
and/or partial hydrolysates thereof, in which 


a
is 1 or 2, 
R³
can be identical or different and is a monovalent 
organic radical and 
R⁴
can be identical or different and is an alkyl radical, 
and 
 
organo(poly)siloxanes of the formula
(R⁵₂SiO)
b
   (IV)

 
in which 


R⁵
can be identical or different and is a monovalent 
organic radical and 
b
is an integer having a value from 3 to 8, 
  
 

and mixtures thereof,
 
is [sic]
 reacted with water in the presence of acid, the 
alcohol formed being at least partly distilled off, 

in a 2nd stage
 
the homogeneous reaction mass obtained in the 1st stage 

is reacted in the presence of a base and at least an 
amount of water-insoluble organic solvent which is 

sufficient to obtain a homogeneous reaction mass, and the 
water and alcohol are removed by distillation,
 
in a 3rd stage
 
the homogeneous reaction mass obtained in the 2nd stage 

is neutralized with an acid, if appropriate water and 
alcohol still present is [sic]
 distilled off and the salt 
formed from the neutralization, which has precipitated 

out, is removed, and
 
if appropriate, in a 4th stage
 
the homogeneous reaction mass obtained in the 3rd stage 

is freed from the water-insoluble organic solvent. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the 1st stage, the acid is employed in an amount 

of 0.2 to 50 mmol, based on 1000 g of the reaction mass 
of the 1st stage before the distillation. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, in the 1st stage, HCl is employed in an amount 

of 100 to 500 ppm, based on the total weight of the 
reaction mass of the 1st stage before the distillation. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that, in the 2nd stage, the base 

employed is one chosen from the group consisting of 
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, methylamine, 

ethylamine, diethylamine and benzyltrimethylammonium 
hydroxide. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the water-insoluble organic 

solvent employed is toluene or o-, m- or p-xylene. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that hexamethyldisiloxane and/or 

trimethylethoxysilane, if appropriate mixed with 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane 
and/or  

 
vinyldimethylethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane and/or a 

partial hydrolysate thereof
 
in a 1st stage
 
is [sic]
 mixed with water and 0.2 to 50 mmol of acid, 
based on 1000 g of the reaction mass of the 1st stage 

before the distillation, the components is [sic] reacted 

at the boiling temperature of the reaction mass and under 
a pressure of between 900 and 1100 hPa, and the ethanol 

formed is distilled off,
 
in a 2nd stage
 
the homogeneous reaction mass obtained in the 1st stage 

is reacted in the presence of a base chosen from the 
group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide 

and methylamine and a water-insoluble organic solvent, at 

the boiling temperature of the reaction mass and under a 
pressure of between 900 and 1100 hPa, water and ethanol 

being distilled off completely or virtually completely,
 
in a 3rd stage
 
the homogeneous reaction mass obtained in the 2nd stage 

is neutralized with an acid, if appropriate water and 
ethanol is [sic]
 distilled off completely and the salt 
formed during the neutralization, which has precipitated 

out, is filtered off, and, if appropriate,
 
in a 4th stage
 
the reaction mass obtained in the 3rd stage is spray-dried 

under a nitrogen atmosphere. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that hexamethyldisiloxane and/or 

trimethylethoxysilane, if appropriate mixed with 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane 
and/or vinyldimethylethoxysilane 

and tetraethoxysilane and/or a partial hydrolysate 
thereof,
 
in a 1st stage
 
is [sic]
 mixed with water and 100 to 500 ppm of HCl, 
based on the total weight of the reaction mass of the 1st 

stage before the distillation, the components is [sic] 

reacted at the boiling temperature of the reaction mass 
and under a pressure of between 900 and 1100 hPa, and 

about 70 per cent by weight of the ethanol formed, based  
 

on the total amount of ethanol formed, is distilled off,
 
in a 2nd stage
 
the homogeneous reaction mass obtained in the 1st stage 

is reacted in the presence of a base chosen from the 
group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide 

and methylamine and toluene or xylene as a water-in-soluble 
organic solvent at the boiling temperature of the
