<ABSTRACT>
The system relies on the use of top crowns (1) 
having particular reflectivity characteristics in the 

plastic covering their underside and in the alloy with 
which they are made, in order for the top crowns 

belonging in a particular promotion to be different in 
these respects to the rest of top crowns there are in the 

market, and their validation is carried out with the 
assistance of an identifying mechanism having an optical 

sensor (10) and an inductive sensor (11) before which the 
top crown (1) moves carried by a conveyor belt or band 

(4) when inserted in the said identifying mechanism, the 
optical sensor (10) working with a generator (12) of 

light having a given wavelength that is reflected on the 
underside of the top thereafter to reach the optical 

sensor. The signals generated by the optical (10) and 
inductive (11) sensors upon the passage of the top crown 

(1) are duly processed and compared with the preset valid 
values in a suitable program, and depending upon the 

results obtained the circuit is governed that in turn 
governs a hatch (24) that allows the top crowns (1) to be 

guided towards a rejection duct (27) or an admission duct 
(28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
identifying and hence validating top crowns, of the kind 
used for sealing bottles, for instance refreshment 
bottles and the like, specifically where such tops are to 
be used as a means for activating a circuit, for instance 
a prize-giving circuit for the consumer of the bottled 
product sealed with the subject top crown. A practice that has been known and used for a long 
time is the establishment of prizes encouraging the sale 
of a particular product, and in particular in the case of 
bottled drinks sealed with top crowns the possible prize 
is marked on the underside of the top base, that is 
obviously concealed until opened, the bottle-top being a 
sort of "voucher" that can be cashed in for the relevant 
prize at preset places and times. It is also well-known that there is an increasingly 
widespread tendency to automate the distribution of this 
kind of drinks, and suitably constructed machines are 
hence able to automatically dispense a bottle upon the 
insertion therein of coins for the price of the product. This automation tendency has in fact also caused the 
prize-giving system to progress and thus complementary 
machines also automatically give such prizes, either next  
 
to a machine dispensing drinks automatically or when such 
drinks are purchased by any other means. With this automation in the prize-giving it is 
possible, using the top crown as is conventional to be 
eligible for such prizes, instead of having some top 
crowns marked with respective prizes, for all top crowns 
fulfilling certain conditions to take part, in other 
words, to be identified as pertaining to the promoted 
product, and the automatic prize-giving machine can 
distribute such prizes in accordance with a preset 
program. The system for identifying or validating top crowns 
subject of the invention has been precisely designed to 
duly analyse, coupled to an automatic prize-giving 
machine, all top crowns inserted therein, establishing 
whether a particular top crown belongs to the firm 
promoting the prizes and hence whether it must be 
accepted by the machine, or whether it is a different top 
crown, or any other object that must be invalidated. More specifically and in order to achieve the above 
the system subject hereof comprises providing the top 
crowns pertaining to a particular promotion with likewise 
particular features that may be detected by an 
identifying mechanism dealing with the validation or 
otherwise of the tops inserted therein. In

<CLAIMS>
A system for identifying or validating top 
crowns to be used as a means for activating a circuit, 

characterised in comprising the use of an identifying 
mechanism having an optical sensor (10) and an inductive 

sensor (11) capable of detecting particular 
characteristics exclusively inherent in top crowns (1) 

admissible as valid, in particular characteristics 
relating to the reflectivity and fluorescence of the 

underside of the top crowns and the alloy used to 
manufacture the same, such optical (10) and inductive 

(11) sensors generating signals upon the passage of the 
top crown (1) that are processed and compared with the 

reference values established in a microprocessor (21) 
that in turn generates output signals activating or not 

a circuit depending upon whether the said top crown (1) 
is accepted or otherwise. 
A system for identifying or validating top 
crowns to be used as a means for activating a circuit, as 

in claim 1, characterised in that the identifying 
mechanism has a concealed chamber (2) to which the top 

crowns (1) arrive through a duct (3) in a particular 
position, the said duct (3) having a light emitter (8) 

and a light receiver (9) that detect the passage of the 
top crown (1) and set the gearmotor (5) going, which 

drives a conveyor belt or band (4) arranged horizontally, 
onto which the induct (3) leads and in which path the 

optical sensor (10) and the inductive sensor (11) are 
established. 
A system for identifying or validating top 
crowns to be used as a means for activating a circuit, as 

in the above claims, characterised in that the top crowns  
 

acceptable as valid have the plastic coating on their 
underside provided with areas (13) and (14) having a 

different degree of reflectivity and fluorescence to the 
light radiation with a particular and specific 

wavelength, emitted by a generator (12) working with the 
optical sensor (6), when the top crown (1) acts as a 

reflecting means when it passes in front of the said 
sensor. 
A system for identifying or validating top 
crowns to be used as a means for activating a circuit, as 

in the above claims, characterised in that at the 
conveyor belt or band (4) outlet there is a duct (26) 

receiving the top crowns (1) inside which there is a 
baffle wall (24) driven by an electric magnet or the like 

(25) established in the circuit controlled by the 
validation system, the said duct (26) branching out into 

two lower ducts (27) and (28) for rejection or admission 
of the top crowns, access to which is controlled by the 

said baffle (24).
