<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are video recording and playback techniques and devices which create relative movement between a laser and an otpical medium such as a flexible optical tape, to permit recording of relatively high bandwidth signals. Further, the present invention relates to video recording and playback techniques and devices which optimize relative movement between a laser source and the optical medium in a cost-effective manner. Data spots having a set of predetermined feature sizes (i.e., a set of varying hole sizes) can thus be recorded at a rate useful for high bandwidth signals (e.g., television video signals). Further, recording on a flexible optical medium (e.g., optical tape) can be performed in a manner which optimizes space efficiency on the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a video recording and playback
technology. More particularly, the invention relates to the optical writing and reading
technology of data with respect to a storage medium such as a flexible optical tape.Presently, flexible tape for optical storage of data is known, as described in
US-A- 4,719,615 and US-A- 4,912,696, both identified on their cover page as being
assigned to Optical Data, Inc. To optically record data on a medium such as a flexible
optical tape, a scanning beam of laser light can be directed onto the tape. The laser beam
melts the tape or burns holes in the tape to produce data spots representing bits of data.
The data spots thus have a reflectivity, transmissivity or other optical characteristic which
can be distinguished from the background of the optical tape.Use of a laser to establish data spots representing bits of digital data or analog
data on the flexible tape must be selected with practical limitations in mind. For example,
in moving a laser back and forth across a moving tape, there is a limit to how rapidly the
optical characteristics of a spot on the tape can be altered to form a data spot. Such a
limit can be significant when, for example, the information being recorded corresponds
to the video information of a television signal having a relatively high bandwidth.
Further, such a limitation can be significant when attempting to optimize space efficiency
in recording plural data spots on the optical tape.For example, a relatively low intensity laser can be used to record the data spots
on the tape. However, this requires that the tape be moved relatively slowly thus limiting
the ability of the system to record high bandwidth signals in real time.Alternately, an extremely high power laser can be used to record data spots.
However, such lasers are extremely expensive and thus limit the commercial benefit to
designing an optical recording and playback system which can be used as, for example,
an optical video recorder (i.e., VCR). Further, when using a powerful laser with an
optically sensitive tape, relative movement between the laser and the tape must be
established which will permit the recording of relatively high bandwidth television video
signals. For example, to facilitate subsequent reading of data
which is recorded using the known modified frequency
modulation (MFM) technique, a one to two micron data spot
included in a set of variable size data spots should be
recorded such that it is spaced from a succeeding data
spot by one
