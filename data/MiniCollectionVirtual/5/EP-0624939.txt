<ABSTRACT>
A contact arrangement for withdrawable power circuit breakers in switching installations, connecting tabs being provided in the fixed installation part and on the power circuit breaker, the power circuit breaker being pushed into a fixed position in a mounting rack, and contact links being provided for electrically conductive connection of the fixed connecting tabs to the connecting tabs which are arranged on the power circuit breaker. These contact links are arranged in a contact frame (13) which consists of a contact frame part (63) (which can be displaced into the operating positions OFF, TEST and ON by means of a spindle drive in the mounting rack (1)) and of a replacement frame part (65) which is detachably connected thereto and in which the contact links (47) are arranged. The contact links (47) are replaced, without disconnecting the switching installation, in that a frame carrier (47) can be pushed into the mounting rack (1) and can be fixed in the pushed-in position instead of the power circuit breaker, which frame carrier (47) can be firmly coupled to the replacement frame part (65) and, after it has been released from the contact frame part (63), can be withdrawn with said contact frame part (63) from the mounting rack (1), and can be removed from it.
