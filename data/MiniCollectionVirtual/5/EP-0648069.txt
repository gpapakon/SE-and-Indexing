<ABSTRACT>
Plasma generator (10) includes chamber (14) for containing the plasma 
source and a plurality of coils (12) located inside of chamber (14). Located 

external to chamber (14) are a plurality of permanent multipolar magnets 
(34) operable to establish a magnetic field in the plasma source along an 

axis of chamber (14) and a set of electromagnets (36) located outside of 
chamber (14), which define a preferred propagation direction for a 

whistler wave in chamber (14). Coils (12) resonantly inductive couple RF 
power to the whistler wave so as to transfer a sufficient amount of energy 

to the plasma source to induce a plasma state in the plasma source. Coils 
(12) also generate time varying electromagnetic fields which also sustain 

the plasma state in the plasma source.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of generating plasma by
radio frequency induction, and more particularly to a plasma process
apparatus
as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim 1. Inductively coupled plasmas ("ICPs") generated with
radio frequency ("RF") waves having a frequency generally
between 1 MHz and 100 MHz are capable of providing
charged particle (electron and ion) concentrations in
excess of 1011cm-3 and ion currents to wafer substrates in
excess of 5mA/cm2. The ICP source is thus competitive
with electron cyclotron resonance ("ECR") plasma sources
for semiconductor manufacturing processes requiring
plasma generation. Semiconductor manufacturing processes
that make use of plasmas include dry etching, plasma
enhanced deposition, dry cleaning of wafers, and
applications requiring the generation of ultraviolet (UV)
light.Inductively coupled RF plasma sources have
advantages over both capacitively coupled RF plasma
sources and ECR plasma sources. In contrast to
capacitively coupled RF plasmas, inductively coupled RF
plasmas have substantially lower intrinsic plasma
potentials (<50V) and achieve a substantially higher
ionization efficiency (>5%). Also, the intrinsic plasma
potential is relatively independent of the RF power. The
low intrinsic plasma potential is useful in applications
where high ion energies cannot be tolerated, such as in
dry etching where high ion energies can damage the
devices on the wafer.In ECR plasma sources, the plasma ions are produced
by electron bombardment in a discharge chamber, and
directed towards the surface using magnetic and/or
electric fields. As in the case of ECR systems, the ion
energy of an inductively coupled RF plasma can be varied
independently of the plasma density by biasing the
integrated circuit wafer with a separate RF or DC power
supply. For an ECR plasma source, the pressure at which
the plasma may be effectively generated is also a 
concern. An ECR source is most effective at pressures
below 1 mTorr, which is too low for most semiconductor
process applications. The ICP source, however, has the
advantage of operating over a pressure range that is more
compatible with semiconductor process requirements
(1 mTorr to 50 mTorr). Since the operating pressure is
higher, the pumping requirements for a given gas flow
rate are more modest for the ICP source. In addition,
the ICP source can provide a larger diameter
(15 cm to 30 cm), homogeneous plasma, in a compact design,
and at substantially lower cost than an ECR source.One type of
