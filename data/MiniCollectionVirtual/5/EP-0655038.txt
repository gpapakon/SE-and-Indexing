<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a collision protection device, especially for passengers in vehicles, especially motor vehicles, and again especially for front-seat passengers, consisting of an air-bag in which the air-bag made, e.g., of a polyamide fabric with or without a coating consists of a cover section having a gas inlet aperture in the region of which there may be one or more inserts (e.g. flame protection), and two side sections, in which the gas inlet is in the overlap at the cover ends and is designed for connection to a gas generator or gas generator housing. The invention essentially consists in that the joint (7') of the two cover ends (6) is at the same time the reinforcement of the gas inlet (1') and the securing component for inserts (e.g. flame protection (4')), the joint being annular around the gas inlet.
