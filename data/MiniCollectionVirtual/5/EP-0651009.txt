<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic
elastomer composition. More particularly, this
invention relates to a novel thermoplastic elastomer
composition which is rich in flexibility and excellent
in rubber elasticity over a broad temperature range,
high-temperature creep characteristics, low-temperature
impact resistance, mechanical strength and moldability,
have good oil resistance, good light discoloration
resistance and extremely excellent toning properties in
spite of thermoplastic elastomer, and can be used as a
material for various moldings.Thermoplastic elastomers which are rubbery
soft materials, which do not require a curing step and
which have the same moldability as thermoplastic resins,
have recently been utilized in the fields of automobile
parts, domestic appliance parts, wire-coating materials,
medical parts, miscellaneous goods, and footwear.Typical examples of the structure of a
thermoplastic elastomer includes a type in which a hard
segment and a soft segment are alternately present in a
copolymer chain as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Kokai No. 61-34,050. By varying
the proportion of each segment, thermoplastic elastomers 
of various grades from flexible to rigid have been
produced.Moreover, there are different kinds of thermoplastic
elastomers derived from inexpensive and easily
available materials. That is to say, as disclosed in
Japanese Patent Application Kokoku No. 53-21,021,
a thermoplastic blend of a monoolefin copolymer
rubber partially crosslinked with an organic peroxide
and a polyolefin resin, and a partially crosslinked
composition obtained by melt-kneading a monoolefin
copolymer rubber and a polyolefin resin using an organic
peroxide as a crosslinking coagent, correspond to the
above different kinds of thermoplastic elastomers.However, in the case of the former thermoplastic
elastomer having such a structure that a hard
segment and a soft segment are alternately present in
the copolymer chain, it is necessary for the copolymer
to contain a large amount of the soft segment for
obtaining a flexible thermoplastic elastomer. Usually,
the soft segment is low in tensile strength and inferior
in heat resistance, flow properties and oil resistance,
and hence, the flexible thermoplastic elastomer containing
a large amount of such a soft segment is also low in
tensile strength and inferior in heat resistance, flow
properties and oil resistance, and therefore, cannot be
applied to various uses over a broad range.When thermoplastic elastomers of various
flexibility grades
