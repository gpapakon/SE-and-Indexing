<ABSTRACT>
An inverted V-shaped bulkhead void filler (20) for 
filling empty spaces in a cargo area during shipping has a 

non-pivotable, but disengagable, fastener. The bulkhead 
void filler (20) has a first and second rigid panels 

(26,28) of a sandwich-type construction attached by the 
fastener (30) at an upper end of each of the panels 

(26,28). To form the non-pivotable, but disengagable, 
fastener, the upper end of the second panel (28) fits 

snugly against and is attached to a portion of a core (40) 
of the first panel (26), and a portion (58) of the first 

panel (26) overlaps and is attached to the second panel 
(28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to a light-weight 
bulkhead void filler for filling empty spaces in a cargo 
area to prevent cargo from shifting during transport. More 
particularly, the invention contemplates an inverted 
V-shaped void filler that, when assembled, is 
non-pivotable. The use of light-weight bulkhead void fillers is well-known 
in the art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,132,156 
presents an inverted V-shaped, light weight void filler 
that is comprised of two panels connected at their upper 
ends by a pivotable connection. The panels may be moved 
from a closed, side-by-side position to an open inverted V 
position by moving the bottom ends of the panels outwardly. 
The void filler relies on a limiter to prevent the panels 
from spreading too great of a distance and collapsing 
outwardly. This type of void filler presents a serious 
disadvantage. If the load generated by the cargo during 
shipment is not distributed in a uniform manner on this 
prior art void filler, it has the tendency to collapse by 
pivoting to the closed, side-by-side configuration. Also, 
there exists the possibility that a piece of cargo may fall 
on the pivotable bulkhead void filler which could cause the 
filler to pivot to the closed position. The present invention is intended to overcome or 
minimize all of these problems, as well as to present 
several other improvements. According to this invention a bulkhead void filler for 
use in a cargo area comprises:
 
 
   first and second rigid panels, each having an upper 
end and a lower end;
 
   said first and second panels each having first and 
second face sheets connected by a reinforcing and 
strengthening core, and
 
   fastening means for non-pivotably connecting said 
first and second panels at the upper end of each of the 
panels. Preferred embodiments of the inverted V-shaped 
bulkhead void filler having a non-pivotable, but 
disengagable, fastener have a first and second rigid panel 
of a sandwich-type construction attached by the fastener at 
an upper end of each of the panels. To form the 
non-pivotable, but disengagable, fastener, the upper end of 
the second panel fits snugly against and is attached to a 
portion of a core of the first panel, and a portion of the 
first panel overlaps and is attached to the second panel. Preferred embodiments of void fillers in accordance 
with this invention will now be described with reference to 
the accompanying drawings; in which:-

<CLAIMS>
A bulkhead void filler (20) for use in a cargo area 
comprising: 

   first (26) and second (28) rigid panels, each having 
an upper end and a lower end; 

   said first and second panels (26,28) each having first 
(36) and second (38) face sheets connected by a reinforcing 

and strengthening core (40), and 
   fastening means (30) for non-pivotably connecting said 

first and second panels (26,28) at the upper end of each of 
the panels. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in claim 1, 
wherein said fastening means (30) includes a flap (58) 

formed from a portion of the upper end of the first panel 
(26) for overlapping the upper end of said second panel 

(28). 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in claim 1 or 
2, wherein each of the cores (40) is corrugated and 

attached to the respective sheets (36,38) along 
substantially all of the ridges. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in claim 3, 
wherein an upper end of said second panel (28) abuts and 

rests into an upper portion of said corrugated core (40) of 
said first panel (26) with an optional attachment means. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein said fastening means (30) and 

at least one of the panels (28) includes an attachment 
means (59) thereon for matingly engaging the fastening 

means (30) and the one of the panels (28). 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in claim 4 or 
5, wherein said attachment means (59) is a multiple hook 

and loop fastener such as that sold under the trade name 
Velcro. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein each of said cores (40) is 

comprised of a plurality of M-shaped braces. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in claim 7 in 
which each M-shaped brace comprises a plurality of V-shaped 

sheets (43,45,47) attached to one another. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in claims 7 or 
8, wherein the M-shaped braces are spaced apart from each 

other. 
A bulkhead void filler (20) as defined in any one of 
the preceding claims, further including a spread limiting 

means (78) attached at a bottom portion of each panel 
(26,28) for limiting the distance the panels (26,28) can be 

spread.
