<ABSTRACT>
A white balance adjustment apparatus for adjusting 
red, green and blue video signals of an aiming subject has 

amplifiers (5a, 5b, 5c) for amplifying the R, G, B video 
signals, respectively, a brightness detector (7) for detecting 

the brightness of the subject, and a mode selector (8) for 
selecting either an outdoor lighting mode or an indoor 

lighting mode in accordance with the brightness detected by 
the brightness detector. A white detector (2) is provided for 

receiving the R, G, B video signals for each pixel and 
detecting a pixel with R, G, B video signals that falls in a 

narrow white range when the outdoor lighting mode is selected, 
and in a wide white range when the indoor lighting mode is 

selected. An integrator (3) integrates the number of detected 
pixels in the white range. A white balance gain control (4) 

controls the gain of the amplifiers based on the integrated 
result of the integrator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a white balance adjustment apparatus as used in
video cameras and similar devices. Such an apparatus comprises: amplifying
means for amplifying said color component video signals separately; white detecting
means receiving said color component video signals for each pixel; cumulating
means for cumulating the number of detected pixels; and white balance gain
calculation means for controlling the gain of said amplifying means based on the
cumulated result of said cumulating means. As the performance of white balance adjustment
apparatuses for video cameras has improved in recent years,
internal metering devices requiring no external sensors have
become the mainstream. White balance control is the process
whereby the color temperature of the light source on the
subject being imaged by the camera is detected and compensation
is applied so that achromatic image areas are recorded
achromatically, i.e., so that white is white. Examples
of this type of white balance adjustment apparatus are
described in JP-A- 61-184079
and EP-A- 530 738.An example of this conventional white balance
adjustment apparatus is described below with reference to
Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a conventional
white balance adjustment apparatus comprising input terminals
1, white detector 2, integrator 3, white balance gain
calculator 4, amplifier 5, and output terminals 6. Fig. 5 
is an example showing the white detection area of the white
detector 2 in this conventional white balance adjustment
apparatus. In Fig. 5, the axis of abscissas is the B/G axis,
the axis of ordinates is the R/G axis, the dotted line is the
axis of color temperature change, and the area contained
within the solid line is the white detection area.The red (R), green (G), and blue (B) video signals
input to input terminals 1a, 1b, and 1c are input to the white
detector 2. The white detector 2 passes as output signals Rw,
Gw, and Bw only those near-achromatic signal components of the
input video signal that are within the white detection area
shown in Fig. 5. The integrator 3 integrates one field of
the near-achromatic video signal output from the white
detector 2, and outputs integrated values Rs, Gs, and Bs. The
white balance gain calculator 4 then calculates the white
balance gain from the output signals Rs, Gs, and Bs from the
integrator 3, and adjusts the amplification factor of the
amplifier 5. The white-balanced video signals R', G', and B'
are then output from the output terminals 6a, 6b, and 6c.Because the
