<ABSTRACT>
A dye-containing polarizing film having 
neutral color which comprises at least one disazo dye 

represented by the formula (I) in the form of the free 
acid 


wherein Me is a transition metal selected from copper, 
nickel, zinc and iron, A¹ is phenyl or naphthyl which 

may be substituted or substituted. B¹ is 1-naphthol or 
2-naphthol residue which may be unsubstituted or 

substituted and in which its hydroxy group is adjacent 
to the azo group and is linked with the transition metal 

Me to form the complex, and R₁ is a lower alkoxy; and at 
least two of other specific dyes, and the film causes no 

light to break through the film at dark state within the 
visible radiation wavelength region and is excellent in 

the polarizing activities as well as the durability to 
water and heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polarizing film
containing dyestuffs.Currently, polarizing films are generally
prepared by incorporating iodine or a dichromatic dye as
a polarizing element into a polyvinyl alcohol film which
has been oriented by stretching, or a polyene film which
has been prepared by dehydrochlorinating a polyvinyl
chloride film or dehydrating a polyvinyl alcohol film to
produce polyene and orientating the film.Among those, iodine-containing polarizing
films are good in early stage polarizing activities, but
poor in the durability to water and heat. Thus, the
films have some drawbacks in the lowered polarizing
activities after having been used for a certain period
of time at high temperatures under highly humid conditions.
Several methods for improving the durability
have been proposed, in which the film is treated with
formalin or an aqueous boric acid solution, or a polymer
film having a low moisture permeability is employed as a
protecting film, but these methods are not yet fully
satisfactory.A dye-containing polarizing films using a
dichromatic dye as a polarizing element is better in the
durability to water and heat than iodine-containing
polarizing film, but poor in the polarizing activities. The dichromatic dye-containing polarizing film
of neutral color is prepared by incorporating two or
more kinds of dichromatic dyes into a polymer film and
then orientating the film. If light breaks through two
said polarizing films, which are superposed on each
other so that those orientation directions meet at right
angles (crossed state), at a specific wavelength within
the visible radiation wavelength region, particularly
from 400 to 700 nm, color of a liquid crystal display
using the two polarizing films often changes from the
color that the display should have at a dark state.In order to prevent the color change of the
display due to the light breaking through the films at a
specific wave length, the light transmittance of the
polarizing films at crossed state (cross light transmittance)
must be lowered over the visible radiation
wavelength region, particularly from 400 to 700 nm.The object of the present invention is to
provide a polarizing film of neutral color which is
prepared by incorporating two or more kinds of
dichromatic dyes into a film and then orientating the
film, through which no light breaks at crossed state
within the visible radiation wavelength region,
particularly from 400 to 700 nm and which is excellent
in the polarizing activities as well as the durability
to water
