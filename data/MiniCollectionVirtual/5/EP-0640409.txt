<ABSTRACT>
A system and a method for sorting are provided for 
distributing articles, such as mail pieces or other flats, 

to predetermined destinations. At the destination, the 
particular article is raked by a raking assembly from a 

carrier for placement into a container. The container, 
when full, is gravity fed onto a discharge conveyor and 

automatically replaced with a new empty container. The 
carrier operates on two levels for delivery of articles to 

containers on two levels while maintaining the carriers in 
a horizontal position throughout the sorting process. A 

sloped front end of the carrier allows the articles to be 
transported at a rapid speed and in a continuous fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a system
and a method for sorting articles. More specifically, the
present invention relates to transporting of mail pieces to
destinations on more than one vertical level for sorting.It is, of course, known to deliver mail pieces to a
plurality of destinations based on predetermined
requirements, such as a particular zip code, for example.
However, current operational systems require a significant
amount of floor space in order to implement the sorting
process. The floor space, commonly referred to as a "foot
print", for current systems requires space for the machine
itself, space for access to the machine, and space for
staging of input and output mail.One such system is known and generally illustrated in
U.S. Patent No. 4,503,977 to Kohno et al.The '977 patent requires a significant amount of floor
space to implement the sorting of mail to a plurality of
stacking bins. The bins are arranged in a row as a result
of optically scanning and reading zip codes on the mail.
Whenever a predetermined amount of mail is stacked in a
stacking bin, the mail is transferred to a conveyance
section. When the sorting operation has ended, the mail
sorting apparatus detects if any mail exists on the 
conveyance section. This operation continually repeats
until all mail is removed from the stacking bins.Another system for sorting and processing of mail
pieces is shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,884,370 to Bradshaw et
al. The system disclosed in the '370 patent includes
mechanical carriers magnetically encoded with sort
destinations to transport and remain with respective items
through a processing cycle. A monorail conveyor
distribution system has a three-dimensional suspension
system consisting of belts to provide transport, storage,
switching and supporting of carriers during the processing
operation.As is apparent in the '370 and '977 patents, a
significant amount of floor space is required for providing
mail sorting operations. Further, these prior art mail
sorting systems are inefficient in terms of handling of
mail pieces as well as time required for conducting a
sorting operation.A need, therefore, exists for an improved system and
method for sorting articles, particularly mail pieces. WO-A-93/02812 discloses a mail processing system having
a plurality of carriers traveling along a transport path. One
chain rotates around a first pair of sprockets and second chain
rotates around a second pair of sprockets. Each carrier is
attached to the first and second chains along a common

secured between the first transport chain (42) and the

second transport chain (44); a first plurality of bin
(22) stacked between the first pair of sprockets (50a,

50b) and the second pair of sprockets (52a, 52b) to

rake assembly (106) above each of the plurality of bins
(22) for removing a designated mail piece (108) from at

least one or the carriers (40) into one of the bins
(22) the rake assembly (106) has at least one

finger (110) that slides a mail piece (108) along an upper
surface of each carrier (40) as the carrier (40) is held in a

horizontal position during transport so that the mail piece
(110) falls from an open end of carrier (40) into a bin (22), characterized by:


the second pair of sprockets (52a, 52b) being
longitudinally and laterally displaced but not
