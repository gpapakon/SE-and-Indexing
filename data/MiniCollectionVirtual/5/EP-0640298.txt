<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an "Integrated Garment" 
comprising a single item of apparel covering the upper part 
of the footwear, leaving only the soles uncovered, then 
forming the stockings around the legs, followed by a garment 
body adaptable to the user. There is no separation between the parts referred to. The fashion world is seeking new forms which provide 
the user with enhanced comfort and freedom of movement, 
while making it possible to adopt a variety of shapes, 
according to use. Until now, no integrated item of apparel was known 
which united the different parts of the clothing in a single 
garment to facilitate said user with a means of dressing in 
a single movement which at the same time provided complete 
freedom of movement not available with usual dress, avoiding 
the pressure of full stockings on the waist for example. Specifically, the garment in this invention comprises 
a single part with its corresponding seams to form the 
garment adaptable to all the parts to cover the body, namely 
the upper part of the garment, corresponding to the body, 
reaching the shoulders and even shaping the sleeves, so that 
this part may be beneficially adapted to the user's body. It 
extends downwards in two tubular parts, as if two "panty" 
type stockings, ending at the footwear so that the top of 
such standard footwear is covered by each lower section of 
the garment, and adapted thereto, held in place between the 
cut and the associated sole, so that said standard footwear 
is completely concealed. Each shoe is wrapped in a sheath,  
 
formed by the bottom of the garment being disclosed, made of 
a material preferably of elastic nature, which adapts to 
this bottom part of the footwear, concealing it completely 
but for the sole itself, similarly adapting to the user's 
legs, thighs, waist and body, to form an integrated garment. For preference, the garment includes the part 
corresponding to "panty" type stockings and the lower part 
enclosing the footwear, so that the upper extension covering 
the user's body may or may not include it: the latter may 
be sleeved, or use braces, or have one type or another of 
neckline, with zipper, buttons, etc..., in accordance with 
the enclosed designs. On the other hand, it may also be emphasised that the 
footwear preferably comprises flat, lightweight shoes, e.g. 
the classical slipper, sports footwear, etc... To complete this description and to aid in a better 
understanding of the features of the invention, these 
Specifications are accompanied by a
