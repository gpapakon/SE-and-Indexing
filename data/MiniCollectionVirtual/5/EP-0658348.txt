<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides aqueous inclusion 
complexes of certain known benzothiophene compounds, 

particularly Raloxifene, and water soluble cyclodextrins. Also 
provided are pharmaceutical compositions of such inclusion 

complexes, and methods of using these complexes for inhibiting 
bone loss and reducing serum cholesterol in mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fields of pharmaceutical 
and organic chemistry and provides novel inclusion complexes, 
and pharmaceutical formulations thereof, which are useful for 
the treatment of certain medical indications in mammals. Benzothiophenes of formula I 
 
wherein 
   R1 and R3 each are independently hydrogen, C1-C4 
alkyl, -CO-(C1-C6 alkyl), or -CO-Ar in which Ar is optionally 
substituted phenyl; and 
   R2 is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidino, 
hexamethyleneimino and piperidino; or a salt thereof, are well 
known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,814). These  
 
compounds are known to be effective for the treatment of a variety 
of mammalian, particularly human, medical indications including, 
for example, postmenopausal osteoporosis and high serum 
cholesterol [see, e.g., Draper, et al., Effects of Raloxifene 
(LY139481 HCl) on Biochemical Markers of Bone and Lipid Metabolism 
in Healthy Postmenopausal Women, and Bryant, et al., Protection 
from Bone Loss and Lowering of Serum Cholesterol in the Absence of 
Uterin Stimulation in Overiectomized Rats, Am. Soc. Bone and Min. 
Res., Tampa, 9/18-22/93]. Compounds of formula I, and particularly acid salt 
forms of such compounds including, for example, hydrochloride, 
sulfate, hydrobromide, citrate, and the like, generally are 
poorly water soluble under ambient temperature. Because of this 
poor water solubility, it presently is necessary to administer 
these compounds as a suspension in water using a suspending 
agent such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyethylene 
glycol, and the like. However, the present pharmaceutical 
formulations used with compounds of formula I cannot be utilized 
for many methods of administration. Particularly, formulations useful for intravenous (IV) 
administration must be in the form of a solution. The IV 
administration of a suspension is extremely dangerous because 
particulate material in suspension can lodge in the 
microvasculature of a mammal causing life-threatening blockages 
and embolisms. Water soluble formulations also are necessary for 
intranasal and aerosol administration of pharmaceutical agents 
because water solubility is necessary for such agents to cross 
upper and lower respiratory tract membranes. Failure to provide 
water soluble forms of these agents generally leads to poor drug 
absorption and/or irritation of the respiratory tract. Additionally, it is desirable, although less critical, 
to have water soluble formulations available for other routes of 
admini
