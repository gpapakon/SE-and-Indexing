<CLAIMS>
Device for the releasable attachment of a fuser 
roller (11) to a bearing flange (14, 16) of a fusing 

station of an electrophotographic printer or copier 
having 


a conical spreading element (31, 31a) assigned to 
the bearing flange (14, 16) 
a receiving bush (32, 32a) of resilient elastic 
design with a counter-cone (33) located on the 

inside and surrounding the spreading element (31, 
31a) in the manner of tensioning tong
s and with a 
contact surface (34) located on the outside for 

contact of the receiving bush (32, 32a) against an 
inner radius of the fuser roller (11), the spreading 

element (31, 31a) spreading the receiving bush (32, 
32a) and thus pressing against the inner radius to 

attach the fuser roller (11) to the bearing flange 
(14, 16). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a compression-spring element (44) acting on the 

receiving bush (32, 32a) is arranged in such a way that 
the spring element (44) is tensioned when a clamping 

connection is produced by inserting the spreading element 
(31, 31a) into the receiving bush (32, 32a), and in that, 

upon release of the clamping connection, the spring 
element (44) displaces the receiving bush (32, 32a) and 

the spreading element (31, 31a) relative to one another, 
as a result of which a receiving radius for receiving the 

fuser roller (11) is formed, which is smaller than the 
inner radius of the fuser roller. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in  
 

that the receiving bush (32, 32a) is supported via a stop 
(45) on a stop face (46) of the fuser roller. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the spreading element (31, 31a) and the 

receiving bush (32, 32a) are assigned to the bearing 
flange (14, 16). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the receiving bush (32, 32a) is 

surrounded by a clamping ring (35). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the fuser roller (11) is attached braced 

axially in the fusing station by means of the bearing 
flanges (14, 16) engaging on both sides of the fuser 

roller (11), a first bearing flange (16) being arranged 
fixed to the frame and a second bearing flange (14) being 

arranged so as to be releasable from the frame, and the 
second bearing flange (14) having holding elements (26) 

which are designed in such a way that, upon release of 
the second bearing flange (14), the holding elements (26) 

engage on the fuser roller (11), and the fuser roller 
(11) together with the second bearing flange (14) can be 

pulled out of the fusing station. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the receiving bush (32, 32a) and the spreading 

element (31, 31a) are mounted rotatably on a holder (36) 
which, in turn, is guided axially displaceably on a guide 

(37) of a second bearing flange (14), a spring element 
(38) being arranged between the holder (36) and the 

bearing flange (14) to compensate the thermal axial 
movement of the fuser roller (11). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the receiving bush (32, 32a) has a layer 

having good surface slip, in particular a layer of heat-resistant 
plastic, at least on its counter-cone (33) on 

the inside.
