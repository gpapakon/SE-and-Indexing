<ABSTRACT>
Underneath and integral with the conveyor (2) that feeds 
the rolls (R) horizontally to the machine, is a unit (20) 

that can be raised, into alignment with the roll feeding 
conveyor (1), and that turns said rolls through ninety 

degrees to deposit them in single file and vertically in 
straight horizontal channels (227) where the sets of 

rolls (R') are taken at the right moment by the pushing 
cross pieces (30) travelling along the lower side of a 

parallel-chain conveyor (31) driven in phase with the 
machine, stably mounted in the latter, and feeding the 

sets of rolls in phase to the subsequent means of stacking 
and packing. The roll orienting unit is designed to 

turn with variable speed and in phase with the machine 
cycle, to form sets made up of a selectable number of 

rolls. The pushing cross pieces (30) of said conveyor, by 
which the sets of vertical rolls are carried forward, are 

designed for quick removal when the machine is used for 
packing horizontal rolls, in order to allow for the 

passage through said conveyor of the conveyor (2) mounted 
above the orienting unit (20), which is lowered.

<DESCRIPTION>
Machines for packing sets consisting of superimposed 
layers of products such as, for example, rolls of 
paper, boxes or the like, arriving in single file and in 
a plurality of lines from a single feeding line are 
known. Machines of this kind are disclosed in, for 
example, US Patent No. 3 455 085 or in Italian Patent No. 
1 225 033, to which documents full reference is made. 
These machines are designed for packing rolls whose axes 
are vertical or horizontal, as required. The invention 
proposes a combined machine which, by means of small and 
rapid setting operations, is capable of packing either 
horizontal or vertical rolls, with the possibility in 
either case of forming sets of any number of rolls. The features of the combined machine according to 
the invention, and the advantages procured thereby, will 
become clear in the following description of a preferred 
embodiment, which is illustrated purely by way of a non-restricting 
example in the figures shown on the single 
accompanying sheet of drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 schematically shows the machine as 
configured for packing rolls of paper with their axes 
horizontal; Fig. 2 shows the machine as configured for 
packing rolls of paper with their axes vertical; Figs. 3 and 4 show rolls of paper, the first 
with a horizontal axis and the second with a vertical 
axis. Referring initially to Figure 1, it will be seen 
that the machine for packing one or more superimposed  
 
layers of rolls R of toilet paper comprises conveyors 1 
and 2, one following the other, on which these rolls 
travel, being guided in single file and in a plurality of 
parallel lines, in the direction indicated by the arrow 
3. The axes of the rolls are horizontal, as shown in 
Figure 3. From the conveyor 2 the rolls are fed to a 
conveyor 4 equipped at the end part with a surface 5 
which cyclically oscillates about a transverse spindle 6 
and which, when raised, stops the lines of rolls against 
a retainer 7, whereas when lowered it permits these rolls 
to pass through in guide channels 8 in which said oscillating 
surface forms sets made up of a predetermined 
number of rolls. When the oscillating surface 5 rises, 
the set of rolls that has been fed into the channels 8 is 
pushed forward by one of the cross pieces 9 of a 
parallel-chain conveyor 10, driven in phase with the 
oscillating movement of the surface 5. The guide channels 
8 have an end part 108 which, in response to a command, 
oscillates about a transverse spindle 11 so that the sets 
of rolls 1 are fed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A machine for packing articles such as rolls of paper 
(R, R') comprising a feeding line (1), a first feeding 

conveyor (2), a second gathering conveyor (4), a third 
conveyor (8, 10) with pushing cross pieces (9), said third 

conveyor being provided with at least one pivoting end 
portion (108) which positions itself alternately against 

superimposed lower and upper stacking surfaces (12, 13), 
synchronized conveyors (16, 17) with pushing cross pieces 

(14, 15) being provided at the stacking surfaces for 
delivering the rolls onto a wrapping machine lifting 

platform (18) 
characterized by the fact that 

underneath the first feeding conveyor (2) and integral with 
the supporting frame of the said first conveyor there is 

provided a carousel unit (20) which can be raised from a 
lower rest position to an upper operative position and 

aligned with the second gathering conveyor (4) and which can 
be connected with the feeding line (1) through an auxiliary 

conveyor (26) leading to the bottom part of guide channels 
(27) having an initial ascending part (127) curving though 

90° and a subsequent horizontal straight part (227) along 
which the spokes (121) of a rotating wheel (21) transfer the 

rolls from the auxiliary conveyor (26), whereby the rolls 
are turned with their axes through 90°, a pushing conveyor 

(31) being provided for transferring the rolls from the said 
horizont
al straight part (227) along said second conveyor 
(4) to the said third conveyor (10). 
A machine according to claim 1, in which the rotating 
wheel (21) is driven by means of an electronically-controlled 

motor connected to a processor unit (24). 
A machine according to claim 1, in which the pushing 
conveyor (31) comprises, as pushing elements, removable 

cross pieces (30) which can be easily and quickly removed 
when said carousel unit (20) is lowered to its rest 

position.
