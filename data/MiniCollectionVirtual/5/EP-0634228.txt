<ABSTRACT>
The surface to be cleaned is set in vibration by an ultrasound transmitter (3) so that the impurities are released through the formation of cavitation in the surface area. The ultrasound transmitter can be attached directly to the surface being cleaned. This surface has a thickness of about a quarter of the wave length of the ultrasound. The ultrasound transmitters can be mounted in front of the surface to be cleaned. The surface being cleaned has a fascia panel of material which can be easily excited by the ultrasound. The surface to be cleaned can be a light-permeable panel connected to the appts. by water-impermeable vibration-damping coupling elements.
