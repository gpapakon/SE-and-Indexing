A roller for measuring the surface flatness of a 
strip produced in a continuous process, for example a 

steel strip, said roller being rotatably mounted about 
its axis and of the kind which has a hollow cylindrical 

bed (11), a collar (13) and two hollow journals (12, 
12′), characterised in that it comprises a fibre optic 

device for measuring force, by means of the 
birefringence occurring in a monomode optical fibre 

subjected to a lateral force, the optical fibre or 
optical fibres (5a) of the force-measuring device 

forming at least one winding (14) of at least one turn 
(5′a) around the cylindrical bed (11), which is placed 

in contact with the collar (13) such that it is 
subjected to the mechanical stress produced by the 

pressure of the strip on the collar. 
A roller according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the fibre optic device for measuring force has a 

stabilised power supply (2), a monochromatic light 
source (1), a polariser (3) and at least a monomode 

optical fibre (5), a polarimetric analyser (7), a 
photodetector (8) and a phase-following electronic means 

(9) arranged inside the cylindrical bed (11). 
A roller according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the force-measuring device with 

which it is equipped has a plurality of optical fibres 
(5a, 5b, 5c) which are mounted in parallel and form 

spaced windings (14, 15, 16 ...) of at least one turn 
(5′a, 5′b, 5′c) around the cylindrical bed (11) and are 

distributed over the width of the bed (11). 
A roller according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the light source (1) is a laser.  

 
A roller according to any one of claims 2, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that it also has a multiplexer (21) 

which is arranged inside the cylindrical bed (11) and to 
which the
 phase-following means (9a, 9b, 9c) are 
connected. 
A roller according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
Characterised in that it has a photo diode (22) which is 

arranged in the roller shaft close to the outer face of 
a journal (12, 12′). 
A roller according to any one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that it has at least one optical 

coupler (20) to which a plurality of optical fibres (5a, 
5b, 5c) are connected. 
A roller according to any one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that one of the journals (12), has 

conductive rings (24, 25) connected to the stabilised 
power supply (2). 
A roller according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the collar (13) is made of 

synthetic material, for example resin. 
A roller according to any one of claims 1 and 3, 
characterised in that it has, in the vicinity of the 

windings (14) of the force-measuring optical fibre (5a), 
secondary windings (24) of optical fibres which are 

sensitive to temperature and arranged such that they are 
not subjected to mechanical stresses produced by the 

pressure of the strip on the collar (13). 
A roller according to claim 10, characterised in 
that said secondary windings (24) are Positioned in 

grooves machined in the cylindrical bed (11) in the 
direct vicinity of where the main windings (14) are 

Positioned.
