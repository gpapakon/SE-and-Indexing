<ABSTRACT>
2.1 To improve the audio signal transmission, audio signals are additionally recorded and scanned in accordance with the hifi depth-division multiplex method in addition to the video signal on the helical tracks in home video recorders. Additional rotating heads record the audio signal in the depth of the magnetic layer and the video heads write the video signal on the surface of the tape. The invention makes it possible to omit these additional heads and electronic and mechanical accessories, improves the crosstalk characteristic, avoids head changing problems and ensures full compatibility with the existing system. 2.2 This is made possible in that the video heads are additionally supplied with at least one audio carrier signal which is intermittently modulated with samples of the audio signals during the horizontal blanking in addition to the composite FM signal and converted chrominance signal. 2.3 The video recorder provides for hifi stereo operation in home video recorders, especially also at reduced tape speed.
