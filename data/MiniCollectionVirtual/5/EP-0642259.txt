<ABSTRACT>
A frequency-modulation halftone screen and method for making 
same, utilizing local randomization (344) of a 

deterministic screen (342). The 
deterministic screen optimizes uniformity of the halftone dot 

distribution, while the local randomization suppresses artifacts due 
to subject moir√©.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of frequency-modulation
halftoning suitable for the reproduction of continuous
tone images, more in particular to a method utilizing local
randomization of a deterministic screen.Many reproduction methods are only capable of reproducing a
small number of stable image tones. For example, offset printing is
only capable of printing two stable tone values i.e. deposit ink or
not. In order to reproduce images having continuous tones, a
halftoning or screening technique is used. In the graphic arts
environment, halftoning techniques convert density values of tints
and images into a geometric distribution of binary dots that can be
printed. The eye is not able to see the individual halftone dots,
and only sees the corresponding "spatially integrated" density
value. In a more general context, halftoning techniques can be seen
as methods to convert "low spatial, high tonal resolution
information" into an equivalent of "high spatial, low tonal
resolution information". (The qualifiers "low" and "high" have to
be seen on a relative scale in this context).Two main classes of halftoning techniques have been described
for use in the graphic arts field. These two techniques are known
as "amplitude modulation" and "frequency modulation" screening. In
amplitude modulation screening the halftone dots, that together give
the impression of a particular tone, are arranged on a fixed
geometric grid. By varying the size of the halftone
dots, the different tones of images can be simulated. Consequently,
this technique can also be called "dot-size modulation screening".
In frequency modulation screening the distance between the halftone
dots is modulated rather then their size, and can also be referred
to as "dot-pcsition modulation screening". This technique, although
well known in the field of low resolution plain paper printers, has
not obtained much attention for offset printing and other high end 
printing methods, probably because of the disadvantages to be
discussed below.Both classes of halftoning techniques are used in combination
with a digital film recorder. A typical digital film recorder
employs a scanning laser beam that exposes a photosensitive material
at high resolution. The "grid" that defines the resolution at which
the laser beam can be switched on or off, usually has an element
size in the range of 1/1800 of an inch. The photosensitive material
can be a photographic film from which a printing plate is later
prepared by means of photomechanical techniques. The

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a frequency-modulation halftone screen
having a plurality of halftone dots, comprising the steps of :


generating a Bayer dither matrix ;
subdividing said Bayer dither matrix into a plurality of
parcels with each of said parcels having a plurality of screen

function values ;
randomly permuting the positions of said screen function values
within each of said parcels thereby producing a locally-randomised

deterministic frequency-modulation screen function ;
and,
utilising said locally-randomised deterministic frequency-modulation
screen function to produce the frequency-modulation

halftone screen.
The method according to the previous claim, comprising the steps
of :


subdividing each of said plurality of parcels into a plurality
of sub-parcels ;
randomly permuting the positions of said sub-parcels within
said parcels ; and,
repeating the previous two steps recursively for each sub-parcel
until a sub-parcel comprises only a single screen

function value.
The method according to any one of the previous claims, wherein
said halftone dots lie on a non-periodic, hexagonal, rectangular

or square grid.
The method according to any one of the previous claims, wherein
said halftone dots can take on more than two values.
The method according to any one of the previous claims, wherein
said halftone dots can have more than one size. 
The method according to any one of the previous claims, wherein
said screen function values can take on at least two values.

comprising the step of replicating horizontally and vertically

said locally-randomised deterministic frequency-modulation screen
function.
