<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for promoting halogen exchange in feedstocks such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane to yield chlorofluorohydrocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons is made by halogenating iron oxide Fe3O4 or other non-stoichiometric oxide with SF4 to produce both Lewis acid and Bronsted acid sites. The feedstock is presented to the catalyst with HF to replace chlorine atoms of the feedstock with fluorine.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CATALYST FOR PROMOTING HALOGEN EXCHANGE This invention relates to a catalyst for promoting halogen exchange, its preparation and its use for halogen exchange and saturation reactions in halocarbons and halohydrocarbons.Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are widely used in industry as refrigerants, solvents, blowing agents and aerosol propellants. However, CFCs have been implicated in the depletion of ozone; it is believed that the CFCs, in themselves inert, diffuse up through the troposphere and concentrate in the upper atmospheric layer or stratosphere, until they are decomposed by ultraviolet radiation with the production of chlorine radicals which consequently initiate catalytic ozone destruction. Hence, there is a need to replace the most environmentally damaging of these compounds, and their use is regulated by the Montreal Protocol. Candidate replacement molecules should ideally contain no chlorine or bromine in their structure. The hydrofluoroalkane molecules CH3CF3 (143a), CH2FCF3 (134a) and CH2F2 (032) are considered as suitable replacement molecules as are to a lesser extent CH3CF2C1 (142b) and CH3CFC12 (141b). It is known from US Patent 4873381 to make the hydrofluoroalkaneCH2F.CF3 HFA-134a by hydrogenating 1 ,1-dichlorotetrafluoroethane CC12F.CF3 (114a) at 300°C on 2% palladium supported on fluorinated alumina. The CFC precursor molecules such as CCI2F.CF3 (114a) are produced by fluorination of chlorocarbons or chlorohydrocarbons with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at 350°-450°C in the vapour phase using a fluorinated chromia catalyst. The use of aluminium trifluoride as catalyst is proposed in European Patent Application 0353059A for the fluorination of chloroalkenes such as CCl =CH2 to CCI2F.CH3 at up to 120°C. A catalyst produced from fluorinated aluminium oxide to be used for low temperature halogen exchange reactions is suggested in European Patent Application 0439338A but its use is limited to halohydrocarbon substrate molecules, and does not report the bulk production of CFCs using the catalyst under mild conditions. 

Further, the use of chromia as a catalyst to produce CFCs, as suggested by Blanchard et al_. in Applied Catalysis, 5£, (1990), 123-128, and in US Patent 4843181, gives a poor yield in some cases and is undesirable since chromium (VI) environments are now thought to be carcinogenic.It would be desirable to be able to produce CFCs or chloro¬ fluorohydrocarbons (HCFCs) from halocarbon, e.g. chlorocarbon or halohydrocarbon, e.g. chlorohydrocarbon feedstock (i.e. even CFCs from
