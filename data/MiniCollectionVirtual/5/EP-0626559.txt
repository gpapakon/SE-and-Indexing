<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus according to the invention comprises two support rollers (4, 5) having parallel axes and carried by a base (1), and a displaceable support roller (20) carried by the base (1), with means (27) for holding and positioning a probe (32) with respect to the article to be checked. The support rollers (4, 5) are mounted on respective support blocks (2, 3) which pivot on the base (1) about pivoting axes (II) which are parallel to the axes of the support rollers (4, 5) and which can be locked in rotation by locking members (6). The support rollers (4, 5) are driven in rotation by a manual drive button (10) and a transmission device. By pivoting the support blocks (2, 3), it is possible to adjust the separation of the support rollers (4, 5) as a function of the diameter of the article to be checked.

Concentricity verification equipment consisting of:

two supporting rollers (4, 5) with parallel shafts (IV, V) supported by
a base (1), with supporting rollers (4, 5) both driven in rotation by

driving means (10),
a movable supporting roller (20), supported by base (1), adapted to
push back a part and check it while bearing against supporting rollers

(4, 5),
means (27) of maintaining and positioning a probe (32) in relation
with the item to be verified, in various areas that are offset axially,

characterized in that:

each of the supporting rollers (4, 5) can be moved laterally on base
(1) in parallel with one another so as to be moved away or moved

closer to one another and so as to be locked in any desired position
by the locking devices (8, 9) that can be operated by the user in such

a way that the user can modify the relative interval between
supporting rollers (4, 5) so as to change and adapt the measurement

conditions,
each supporting roller (4, 5) is mounted on respective supporting
blocks (2, 3) pivoting on base (1) on a pivoting shaft (II, III) parallel to

the shaft of supporting roller (IV, V) and which can be blocked in its
rotation by said locking devices (6, 9), operated by the user.
Equipment according to claim 1, characterized in that the
driving means include:


a manual driving knob (10) mounted so as to rotate at the end of the
pivoting shaft (II) of one of the supporting blocks (2) and integral with

two coaxial driving pulleys (11, 12) connected by toothed belts (13,
14) respectively to the first pulley (15) mounted at the end of rotation

shaft (IV) of first supporting pulley (4) and to a second pulley (16)
mounted to rotate at the end of pivoting shaft (III) on the other of the

two supporting blocks (3), said second pulley (16) being integral with
a third coaxial pulley (17) connected by a toothed belt (18) to a fourth

pulley (19) mounted at the end of the rotation shaft (V) of the second
support roller (5).
Equipment according to claim 1, characterized in that
locking device 6, 9) includes a radial screw (7) screwing into the

tapped radial bore (8) of base (I) and bearing either on pivoting shaft
(II) integral with support block (2) or on a force distributing collar

interposed about said pivoting shaft (II), made integral in its rotation
with supporting block (2). 
Equipment according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that it also includes means of adjusting the bearing force of bearing

roller (20).
Equipment according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that bearing roller (20) is supported by a gantry (21) integral with

one of supporting blocks (2), said gantry (21) comprising an upright
(22) adjustable in height, an arm (23) adjustable in length and

articulating on upright (22) while being solicited by a spring pushing
bearing roller (20) in direction (24) to bear against the part to be

verified.
Equipment according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that it also includes at least one supporting arm for probe (27)

comprising several parameters (28, 29, 30, 31) articulated with
respect to one another and whose base (28) is mounted to pivot at

the end of a shaft (2) integral with one of the supporting blocks (22)
with at least one locking stop articulation defining a test position to

which it is easy to return after the pivoting of arm (27) in the direction
causing it to move to and from the part to be verified.
Equipment according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that it also includes an axial stop (25) adjustable in its positioning,

and against which the part to be verified bears.
