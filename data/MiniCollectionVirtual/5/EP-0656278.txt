<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle seat with an upholstered seat element (4), in particular aircraft seat, with a support element (6) which is formed from foamed plastic and comprises a bearing component (7) made of an elastic foamed plastic (42) with a first weight by volume and an upper component (8) made of an elastic foamed plastic with a second weight by volume which is lower than the weight by volume of the bearing component (7), and a covering material (62), which components are connected to one another, in particular bonded at certain points. If appropriate, a flame-resistant intermediate layer (51) made of mesh or high-temperature-resistant fibres or threads (52) which are laid in a lattice configuration are arranged between the support element (6) and the covering material (62). At least over part of the thickness (12) of the bearing component (7) and/or of the upper component (8), an insertion component (9, 84) is arranged between a front and/or rear end edge (11, 25) of the bearing component (7) and/or upper component (8) and approximately a central region of the same. The latter is harder than the bearing component (7) and/or upper component (8). The weight by volume of the insertion component (9, 84) is lower than the first weight by volume of the bearing component (7).
