The telescopically structured apparatus is composed of two 
components that are able to slide within one another. Basically by means 

of permanent thrust, the two ends of the apparatus are drawn closer 
together. A contrary elastic force, opposing this reunion (one of these 

components is a piston (2. 22. 52.) made up of a head (4, 23, 53) equiped 
with a washer (5, 23-1, 53-1) that is able to slide in an airtight fashion 

through the length of the cylindrical inner wall of the chamber(6. 25. 54)) 
forms the other component. The chamber which is opposed by the piston 

using end, is linked up to a reservoir (9. 26) by a passage containing a 
primary one way valve (12. 35), allowing the driving back of gas from the 

chamber into the reservoir by way of the piston, a second one way valve 
(14) then permits the intake of gas from outside by means of the piston (a 

way to trigger off the consequent movements (11. 37)) assuring the 
unrestricted circulation of gas between reservoir and chamber, once the 

level of required pressure has been attained, for exercising the muscles. 
The apparatus with respect to claim 1 is characterised by means to 
communication based upon a manually operated sluice gate (11), 

mounted in partallel with the first one way valve (12) between the 
chamber (6) and the reservoir (9). 
The apparatus with respect to claim 1 is characterised in the form 
of the means to communication based upon a control column (37-1) 

composed of an opening bit provided to open the anti return valve (35) 
situated between the chamber (25) and the reservoir (26) holding it in the 

open position. 
The apparatus with respect to claim 3 is characterised by a locking 
pin (39) which assures the blocking of the control rod (37) in relation to 

the open position of the one way valve (35). The retreat of the locking 
pin (39) is controlled by the retreat of the piston (22) to its original 

position, thereby freeing the command column (37). 
The apparatus with respect to claim 4 is characterised in an elastic 
fashion (38), forcing the command column (37) to move the one way 

valve (35) into the open position after the retreat of the locking pin (39).  
 
The apparatus with respect to claims 4 or 5 is characterised by a 
butress joined onto a rotational axis (50) parallel to the axis X3 - X3, 

allowing the blocking of the command column (37) in the rear position in 
relation to the valve (35), independently from the position of the locking 

pin (39). 
The apparatus with respect to any of the claims 1-6 is 
characterised by the interior volume contained within the reservoir (9. 26) 

and the chamber (6. 25) and of a three to ten fold superior volume 
displaced by the piston (2. 22) up until its final point at the end of its 

path in the interior of the chamber. 
The apparatus with respect to any of the claims 1-7 is 
characterised bythe fact that the reservoir (26) is set out in a ring shaped 

fashion around the chamber (25). 
The apparatus with respect to any of the claims 1-8 is 
characterised by the way in which it is made up of one individual belt, 

(56-1, 56-2, 57-1, 57-2) assembled in such a way that a contionuous belt 
is formed, travelling along pullies (58-1 - 58-6) arranged within the 

proximity of the two ends, (59, 60) and then double backed in such a way 
as to traverse from side to side over a distance of twice the length of the 

apparatus, presenting thus two internal cables (56-1. 56-2. 57-1. 57-2), 
secured independently at either side in the proximity of their 

surroundings. 
The apparatus with respect to claim 9 is characterised by the way 
the handle (64) includes a notch (70) permitting the easy gain in control 

of at least one of the two cables (69) that traverse the handle, in order to 
effectuate a traction (F1) in the direction defined by the axis of the 

apparatus (X5 - X5), the other handle (63) being brought back to a fixed 
point (66). 
The apparatus with respect to any of the claims 1-8 is characterised 
by the way that the chamber (72), within which the piston (78) head is 

shifted, is interdependent upon the fixed inner wall. The end of the 
piston rod (77) outside the chamber (72) contains a pulley (81) that is in 

free rotation from the perpendicular axis to the axis (X6 - X6) of the rod 
(77), which itself is encircled ( at least partially) by a cable (82) within 

which exist two internal wires, (along with the axis (X6 - X6) of the rod 
(77)) that form acute angles X1, X2. One of these two internal cables 

being double backed to a fixed point (88), the other travelling through at  
 

least one pulley (84) on a fixed axis. Free rotation, comprising of one end 

of the apparatus being fitted with a catch (85), allows the user, whilst 
carrying out traction (F2), to drive back the piston head into the chamber 

(72). 
A method of muscular development where one uses the force of 
muscles in order to close together components of a telescopic piece of 

apparatus. A fluid constituted by what is fundamentally a gas opposing 
an elastic force, accompanied by the penetration of a piston (2.22) in a 

chamber (6.25), of which the end (found at the finish of the path of the 
piston) is linked to a reservoir (9.26). The first one way air valve (12.35) 

then permits the refilling of the reservoir by means of gas driven back by 
the piston itself. A second one way air valve (14.43) then allows gas into 

the chamber (6.25) from outside, during the chamber depression phase 
that is effectuated by the piston. By means of several cyclical movements 

of the piston in the chamber, the refilling of the reservoir by gas up to the 
required pressure is instigated, and a permanent passage of gas is 

established between the chamber (6.25) and reservoir (9.26) with a view 
to assuring the unrestricted circulation of this gas, at least throughout the 

duration of the muscular exercises at this level of pressure. 
The method with respect to claim 12 is characterised by the 
establishment of a permanent passage between the the chamber (6.25) 

and the reservoir (9.26) by means of a command column (37) containing 
an opening bit (37-1) provided in order to open the first one way valve 

(35) and to hold if in that same position.
