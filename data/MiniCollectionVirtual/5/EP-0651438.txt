<ABSTRACT>
An alignment apparatus for aligning the flat edges on semiconductor 
wafers has a roller 13 used to turn the wafers 12 during alignment. The roller 

13 is hollow and has a plurality of holes 14 in the surface of the roller though 
which a vacuum is drawn to remove particle contaminates from and around the 

semiconductor wafers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to semiconductor device processing apparatus, and 
more particularly to an apparatus and method for removing silicon particles 
from semiconductor wafers during wafer flat alignment. During semiconductor wafer processing, it is necessary to locate and align 
the flat edges of the wafers in the wafer cassette to enable automated equipment 
to process the wafers and provide the proper wafer alignment during processing. 
A flat finder apparatus is used to align as many as twenty-five semiconductor 
wafers in a cassette or wafer boat. Flat finders are needed in almost every step 
in the manufacturing process, which can be a many as 170 different steps. Wafer flats are located by placing a number of wafers in a flat locator and 
rotating the wafers until all the flats are aligned. During the rolling and 
alignment process, particles of silicon or other material resulting from surface 
and edge polishing, and other processing steps adhere to the surface and edges of 
the wafers. These particles lead to device defects if they are not removed. The invention is to an apparatus for removing particles from 
semiconductor wafers which is used in conjunction with and forming part of a 
flat alignment apparatus. The apparatus is a roller used on a flat alignment 
apparatus. The roller, which is used to turn the semiconductor wafers during  
 
flat aligning, is cylindrical in shape and has perforations around its outer 
surface through which a vacuum is pulled to pull loose particles, and particles 
from the surface and edges of the wafers into the cylinder for disposal. As the wafers are aligned, the roller turns on bearings and the vacuum is 
pulled through a rotating joint that connects the roller to the vacuum source. 
Roller may be turned by hand, or connected to a motor used with automatic 
wafer aligners. The technical advance represented by the invention as well as the objects 
thereof will become apparent from the following description of a preferred 
embodiment of the invention when considered in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawings, and the novel features set forth in the appended 
claims. FIGURE 1 illustrates a typical wafer aligner with a vacuum roller; FIGURE 2 is a side view, in part, showing the wafers on the vacuum port roller; FIGURE 3 is an end view, in part, showing the air and particle flow into the 
vacuum roller. Figure 1 illustrates a flat alignment apparatus 10 positioned under a 
semiconductor wafer cassette 11. Aligner 10 includes a frame having ends 16 
and 17
