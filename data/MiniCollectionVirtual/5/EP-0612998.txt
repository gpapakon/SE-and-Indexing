<ABSTRACT>
In a method for inspecting a dished end face of a nuclear 
fuel pellet (P), a focused beam of light is emitted to a dish (PA) of 

the end face of the nuclear fuel pellet while a parallel beam 
of light is being emitted to the end face thereof. An image 
of 
the end face of the nuclear fuel pellet is picked up and the 

quality of the pellet is judged based on the picked-up image. 
An apparatus for inspecting a dished end face of a nuclear fuel 

pellet is also disclosed. The inspection apparatus includes a 
handling unit for holding the pellet during inspection, a 

lighting unit for lighting the end face of the pellet, an image 
pick-up unit (232) disposed adjacent to the handling unit for picking 

up image data as to the end face of the pellet, and a judging 
unit operably connected to the image pick-up unit for analyzing 

the image data outputted from the image pick-up unit to judge 
quality of the nuclear fuel pellet. The lighting unit includes 

emitting optical systems (221,223d,223e) for emitting a focused 
beam of light 

to a dish of the end face of the pellet while emitting a parallel 
beam of light to the entire end face of the pellet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for inspecting an end face of a nuclear fuel pellet at the 
center of which a spherical dish or recess is formed, and in 
particular to a method and apparatus of a type which picks up 
an image of the pellet end face and judges the quality of the 
pellet based on this image. When an image of a pellet end face with a spherical dish 
is picked up by emission of a parallel beam of light to the 
pellet end face, the image obtained will have a dark portion 
around the dish. Therefore, when the obtained image is processed 
into a binary image, it is difficult to distinguish the 
dish from defects such as chipping. Japanese Patent Application, First (A) Publication No. 1-136053, 
describes a method which circumvents the aforesaid 
problem by adding correction data from a standard image upon 
processing of the picked-up image into a binary image. This 
method is, indeed, effective on the assumption that images of 
the specimens are picked up in a manner similar to the standard 
image. However, this assumption is often not applicable in 
practice. In addition, due to the undue load on image processing, 
inspection is time-consuming, so that high speed inspection 
of pellet end faces has not been attained. It is therefore the object of the present invention to  
 
provide a method and apparatus for inspecting an end face of a 
pellet by which the pellet end face can be inspected smoothly 
and certainly, and by which load on the image processing can be 
substantially reduced to ensure automatic inspection at high 
speed. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method for inspecting a dished end face of 
a nuclear fuel pellet, comprising the steps of: 
emitting a focused beam of light to the dish of the end face 
of the nuclear fuel pellet while emitting a parallel beam of 
light to the entire end face thereof; and picking-up an image of the end face of the nuclear fuel 
pellet and judging quality of the pellet based on the picked-up 
image. In the foregoing method, it is preferable that the parallel 
beam of light and the focused beam of light be produced 
from a common light source. According to another aspect of the invention, there is 
provided an apparatus for inspecting a dished end face of a 
nuclear fuel pellet, comprising: 
a handling unit for holding the pellet during inspection; a lighting unit for lighting the end face of the pellet, 
the lighting unit including a first means for forming a parallel 
beam of light
