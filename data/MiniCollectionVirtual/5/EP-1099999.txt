<ABSTRACT>
A battery-driven data processing system (100) has
a power control unit in which the power consumption of

the whole system is prevented from increasing by
controlling the clock frequency of a CPU (10) and the

brightness of a display unit (20). When the clock
frequency of the CPU is increased, the brightness of

the display unit connected to the data processing
system having the CPU built therein is decreased while,

when the clock frequency of the CPU is reduced, the
brightness of the display unit is increased thereby to

maintain a substantially constant power consumption.
In the case where the brightness of the display unit

connected to the data processing system is increased,
on the other hand, the clock frequency of the CPU is

reduced, while in the case where the brightness of the
display unit is reduced, the clock frequency of the CPU

is increased thereby to maintain a substantially
constant power consumption. Further, the clock

frequency of the CPU is reduced at the time of spinup
of the drive motor (30) for a disk-shaped recording

medium, and at the end of the spinup operation, the
clock frequency of the CPU can be restored to the

original state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to power control
units. In particular but not exclusively the present
invention relates to power control units for data
processing systems capable of switching the system
performance by changing the operating frequency
(hereinafter referred to as the clock frequency) of a
processing circuit.In recent years, an extension of the use of a
high-performance CPU (central processing unit) has
remarkably improved the processing capability of data
processing systems such as computers which, in turn,
has increased the power consumption. On the other
hand, a portable terminal making up a data processing
system has been reduced in size and weight while the
liquid crystal display panel making up a display unit
has increased in size, which is another cause of
increased power consumption in the data processing
system.Due to the decreased size and weight of the
portable terminal, the capacity of the battery
incorporated in the portable terminal and hence the
electric energy capable of being supplied are limited.
In the case where it is desired to increase the clock
frequency of the processing circuit or the brightness
of the display unit, the power consumption may exceed
the battery capacity. Some means to cope with this
problem is desired.In previously-considered data processing systems
in which the clock frequency of a processing circuit
such as a CPU or a processor can be changed, the system
performance of the data processing system is changed in
response to a user instruction or some change of the
system status such as the insertion or removal of an AC
adaptor. The system performance can be changed by 
changing the clock frequency of the processing circuit
built into the data processing system.Specifically, as disclosed in Unexamined Japanese
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 10-26896 and the like,
one well-known methods of reducing the power
consumption of the computer system consists of reducing
the clock frequency of the processing circuit.
According to this method, the user is permitted to
select the clock frequency of the processing circuit,
so that the user sets the clock frequency of the
processing circuit to a low level by key entry or the
like operation thereby to reduce the capacity of the
computer system as a whole, resulting in a reduced
power consumption.A data processing system operating on a battery,
however, generally has the problem that the operable
range of the system is limited by the total or residual
capacity of the battery. In the case where the clock
frequency of
