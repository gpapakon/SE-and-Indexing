<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blends of a polyamide, a 
polyester, and a combination of unmodified and maleated 
rubbers. Polyesters and polyamides are both widely used 
thermoplastic injection molding materials. Compatible 
blends of these polymers would be very useful since they 
would allow a designer to develop materials with 
specific properties in areas such as strength, 
toughness, chemical resistance and cost. Polyester/polyamide 
blends are generally incompatible, however, as 
evidenced by low impact strengths. Low impact strengths 
preclude the use of these blends in many large, 
structural parts. While impact modifiers well known in 
the art may be used to improve impact strength, they 
generally do not improve the impact strengths of 
polyester/polyamide blends. In particular, blends of 
polyamides and copolyesters based on terephthalic acid, 
ethylene glycol, and cyclohexanedimethanol are not 
usually used for injection molding applications since 
they usually have low impact strengths. Other attempts have been made to improve the impact 
strengths of polyester/polyamide blends. For example, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,812,534 describes the use of a 
copolyesteramide in minor amounts for improvement of the 
impact strength of polyester/polyamide blends. Also, 
D. Gilmore, J. Kirkpatrick, and M.J. Modic describe the 
use of mixtures of unmodified and maleated styreneethylene/butylene-styrene 
(SEBS) rubbers in Nylon 6, 
Nylon 66, polyphenylene-ether/propylene blends,  
 
polyphenylene-ether-Nylon 66 blends and polypropylene/Nylon 
66 blends to improve impact strength as reported 
in Proceedings of ANTEC, (1990), pp. 1228-1233. The problems noted above are overcome with the 
molding compositions of the present invention, 
comprising: 
(a) at least 15 percent by weight of a polyamide 
having an inherent viscosity of 0.6 to 2.5 dL/g, (b) at least 15 percent by weight of a 
copolyester, having an inherent viscosity of 0.5 to 1.0 
dL/g, comprising repeat units derived from terephthalic 
acid, ethylene glycol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 
and (c) from 5 to 30 percent by weight of a 
combination of at least two impact modifiers selected 
from the group consisting of maleated and unmaleated 
ethylene-propylene rubbers wherein at least one said 
impact modifier is maleated. One of the advantages of the blends of the 
invention is that they have unexpectedly improved impact 
strengths. The molding compositions of the invention comprise 
components (a), (b), and (c), as follows: Component (a) comprises at least
