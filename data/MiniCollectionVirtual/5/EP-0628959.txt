<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus for mechanically supporting 
and electrically connecting a magnetic field modulation head (10) 

at least involving a coil (10a) and a core (10b) to a supporting 

frame (16) to permit the head to be slidable on a surface of a 
photomagnetic disc (12) and to be positioned in opposition to a 

laser beam pick up device (14). The apparatus may comprise a 
spring plate member (30,34;40) being connected at its one end 

to the head (10) and being connected at its opposite end to the 
supporting frame (16) to mechanically support the head (10). The 

spring plate member (30,34;40) may include at least a conductive 
part made of an electrically conductive material extending 

between its opposite ends to electrically connect the head (10) 
to the supporting frame (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for mechanically
supporting and electrically connecting a magnetic field
modulation head to be used for a photomagnetic recording.An apparatus of the kind referred to above and set out in the
preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in JP-A-05 081 725.It has generally been known in the art that a photomagnetic
disc is usable for the photomagnetic recording. A conventional
apparatus for mechanically supporting and electrically
connecting the magnetic field modulation head will be
described with reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B. A photomagnetic
recording is carried out by contacting a magnetic field
modulation head 10 with a surface of a photomagnetic disc 12
at such a contact pressure as to allow the magnetic modulation
head 10 to be slidable on the surface of the photomagnetic
disc 12. The magnetic field modulation head 10 involves a 
magnetic field modulation coil 10a therein.The magnetic field modulation head 10 is mechanically
supported by a supporting member 20 comprising a metal spring
plate which is mechanically fixed to a supporting frame 16.
Namely, the magnetic field modulation head 10 is mounted
through its mounting portion 10a to one end of the metal
spring plate supporting member 20 whose opposite end is fixed
to a top portion of the supporting frame 16. The spring plate
supporting member has a bent portion to facilitate to perform
as a spring member. The magnetic field modulation head 10 is
electrically connected through a conductive plate connecting
member 22 for receiving electrical signals for the magnetic
field modulation in which the conductive plate connecting
member 22 is required to be made of an electrically conductive
material to allow the electrical signals to be transmitted
therethrough. The conductive plate connecting member 22 is
also required to be a flexible member to allow the magnetic
field modulation head 10 to exhibit a vertical motion to the
surface of the photomagnetic disc 12. The magnetic field
modulation head 10 is mounted at its top surface to one end of
the conductive plate connecting member 22 whose opposite end
is also fixed to the top portion of the supporting frame 16 so
that the coil 10a involved in the magnetic field modulation
head 10 is electrically connected through a wiring to the
conductive plate connecting member 22. A pair of the spring 
plate supporting member 20 and the conductive plate connecting
member 22 constitutes a supporting and connecting apparatus.The supporting frame 16 is L-shaped to extend upward and also
extend
