having a plurality of modules positioned immediately adjacent each other, 

with each of the plurality of modules having an array of photosensitive 
detectors arranged in a plurality of rows and columns, each of the 

photosensitive detectors having a radiation sensitive area; and circuit means 
for selectively addressing one of the photosensitive detectors by addressing 

one of the plurality of rows and one of the plurality of columns and reading 
the output of the one of the array of photosensitive detectors where each 

of the plurality of modules being arranged in a three dimensional structure 
in which the array of photosensitive detectors is arranged on a planar first 

surface of the module covering substantially the entire area of the planar first 
surface. The circuit means is located within the module in an area away 

from the planar first surface opposite from the received radiation. 
Photosensitive detectors located along an edge of the module having non-radiation 

sensitive circuitry located opposite the edge from the radiation 
sensitive area. The ra
diation sensitive area of the edge photosensitive 
detectors are smaller than the radiation sensitive area of the inside 

photosensitive detectors and the center to center distance of the radiation 
sensitive area of adjacent photosensitive detectors is maintained 

substantially constant between adjacent edge photosensitive detectors as 
adjacent inside photosensitive detectors. The module further has a p/n diode 

along the edge of the module.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to solid state radiation detection
panels and, more particularly to large area solid state radiation detection
panels constructed by adjoining a plurality of single unit sensor tiles, as
basically known from WO-A-91/10921.X-rays are commonly used to diagnose medical conditions in humans
and animals and in many industrial uses. For medical purposes, an object,
typically a portion of the body of a person or animal, is exposed to X-rays
while positioned in proximity of a radiation sensitive media. A latent image
of the object is formed in the radiation sensitive media which can be
subsequently developed to aid the medical practitioner in viewing aspects of
the body which can not be directly visually seen. Conventionally, silver
halide films in conjunction with a light emitting phosphor sensitive to X-rays
are used for this purpose.More recently, radiation detectors have been constructed which
eliminate the use of silver halide films in the detection of the object
subjected to X-ray radiation. Radiation detectors are designed to detect
incident radiation and convert that incident radiation into an electrical signal
which can be utilized to construct a pixel by pixel representation of the
image. A radiation detector is sensitive to X-rays but instead of forming an
image of the object in silver halide film, the radiation detector directly
converts the energy contained in the X-rays to electrical signals. These
electrical signals can then be digitized, if they aren't already digital, and can
digitally represent the image of the exposed object in a pixel by pixel basis.
The digital representation of the image can then be viewed on conventional
displays or monitors, transmitted to remote sites, stored electronically and 
printed in imagers to provide a visual output similar to that which medical
practitioner is accustomed.Such radiation detectors typically involve an array of photosensitive
detector elements constructed in array to form an entire X-ray image.
Typical X-ray images are 35.6 centimeters (14 inches) by 43.2 centimeters (17 inches)
and typically comprise an array of pixels of approximately
4,000 X 5,000. Thus, as many as 20,000,000 pixels may be contained in
a single image.Since direct digital radiation detectors are formed with an individual
photosensitive element for each pixel of image, the same number or a
greater number of individual photosensitive elements are required. Such
photosensitive elements are typically formed using integrated circuit
technology. Not
