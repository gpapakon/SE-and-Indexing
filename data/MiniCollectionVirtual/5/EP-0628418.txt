<ABSTRACT>
A glide bearing subsystem is described. The invented bearing subsystem 
(10) includes an expanse having a non-circularly cross-sectional through hole (12
a
) 
providing in a first, e.g. an upper, region thereof (12
b
) two arcuately spaced 
planar contact surfaces (12
c
, 12
d
) providing dual parallel lines of contact with a 
cylindrical rail (R) upon which the carriage (16) is mounted for reciprocal axial 

movement. A second, e.g. a lower, region (12
e
) of the hole (12
a
) generally 
opposite and preferably smoothly joining the first hole region (12
b
) is 
semicylindrical and of slightly greater diameter than that of the rail (R), thereby 

controlling inadvertent lift-off of the carriage (16) during acceleration phases of 
its reciprocal movement along the rail (R). Preferably, the carriage (16) has a 

pair of axially spaced bearings (12, 14) formed in generally planar thin expanses 
of oil-impregnated bronze, which expanses are made by a sintering process and 

are insert molded integrally with the printer's carriage (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to glide
bearings for carriages moving on rails. More specifically,
it concerns a glide bearing subsystem that provides two
spaced lines of contact between a carriage and a rail for
increased dynamic stability of a reciprocating carriage.
The invention is described and illustrated in the context of
an ink-jet printer, although it is not limited thereto.Typically, glide bearings in reciprocating carriage and
rail systems such as those used in low-cost printers have
used cylindrical holes of circular cross section slightly
greater in diameter than that of the cylindrical rails of
circular cross section rails reciprocating laterally
therethrough. Such structures provide reasonable dynamic
stability and long life. There are problems, however: such
bearing structures provide a single line of contact at the
point of tangency between the carriage and the rail, which
line of contact tends to move in response to external
forces. The result is a lack of control of the carriage
relative to the rail and undesirable and uncontrollable fore
and aft movement of the carriage that reduces print quality.
The problem is worse during times of acceleration and
deceleration of the carriage along the rail, as at either
extreme of its reciprocal movement therealong.In US-A-4744686 there is disclosed a glide bearing
subsystem comprising a generally cylindrical elongate rail
for mounting a carriage for reciprocal movement of the
latter and one or more carriage mounted laterally spaced
bearings. Each bearing includes an expanse having formed
therein a hole for receiving the rail, and the hole includes
dual opposing contact surfaces for engaging the rail.In accordance with the present invention, there is
provided a glide bearing subsystem as specified in Claim 1
hereinafter. The carriage bearing subsystem provides greatly
increased dynamic stability to applications in which a
carriage moves, e.g. reciprocates, axially along one or more
rails to perform a given task, e.g. printing. The bearing
subsystem preferably includes a pair of axially spaced,
insert-molded, generally planar, thin, bronze expanses each
having formed therein a non-circularly cross-sectional
through hole providing in an upper region thereof two spaced
lines of contact with the nickel-plated carbon steel rail
upon which the carriage is supported for reciprocal
movement. The tendency for the carriage to move
undesirably generally within a plane normal to the rail's
long axis, due, for example, to vibration, is virtually
elimi

<CLAIMS>
A glide bearing subsystem (10) for use in a printer
having a reciprocable printhead carriage (16),

said subsystem
comprising:

a generally cylindrical elongate rail (R) for mounting a
carriage (16) for reciprocal movement of the latter, and one

or more carriage-mounted laterally spaced bearings (12, 14)
each including an expanse having formed therein a generally

pear-shaped hole (12a) for receiving said rail (R)

therethrough, said hole (12a) including a first arcuate region (12b)
having arcuately spaced opposing first and second contact

surfaces (12c, 12d) for engaging said rail (R) and a second
arcuate region (12e) opposite the first arcuate region, said first

region being smaller in size than said second region.
The subsystem of Claim 1, wherein each of said contact
surfaces (12c, 12d) is substantially planar.
The subsystem of Claim 1, wherein said contact surfaces
(12c, 12d) are arcuately separated by approximately ninety

degrees.
The subsystem of Claim 1, wherein said surfaces (12c,
12d) are symmetrically located relative to a generally

vertical center line of said hole (12a).
The subsystem of Claim 1, wherein a second region (12e)
of each of said holes (12a) generally opposite said first

region (12b) is spaced from said contact surfaces (12c, 12d)
sufficiently to provide slight clearance from said rail (R).
The subsystem of Claim 1, wherein said expanses are
insert-molded integrally with the carriage (16).
The subsystem of Claim 1, wherein said expanses are made
of oil-impregnated bronze.
The subsystem of Claim 7, wherein said expanses are made 
by sintering.
The subsystem of Claim 8, wherein the oil content by
volume of said expanses is greater than approximately 19

percent.
