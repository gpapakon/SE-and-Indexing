<ABSTRACT>
A new class of compounds is disclosed for the manufacture of a medicament for: 1) treating neurological, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, neuropsychopharmacological and functional disorders associated with excessive or insufficient activation of the glutamate subtype of the NMDA receptor; 2) treating cognitive disorders associated with suboptimal activation or deactivation of the glutamate subtype of the NMDA receptor; and 3) improving and enhancing memory, learning, and associated mental processes. The compounds of the new class, derived from the toxin Conantokin-G, act as allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor cation channel and have effects ranging from inhibitory to partial modulatory to fully stimulatory on the polyamine or a closely associated modulatory site.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor
and more specifically to agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists of a
polyamine associated recognition site which may be used to modulate the
response of the receptor in order to ameliorate certain neurological,
neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric conditions, prevent
neurodegeneration after CNS trauma and injury, as well as to enhance/affect
learning and memory.During the past twenty years a revolution in understanding the basic
structure and chemistry of the synaptic interconnections of neural tissues has
taken place which promises hope that such understanding will permit
treatment of neural tissue damage and disorders. These studies have
centered around an understanding of the properties of the neurochemical
transmitters released from presynaptic membranes and, most importantly, the
postsynaptic receptors for the transmitters. The nicotinic acetylcholine and
GABA receptors have been characterized and found to be under the control
of allosteric modulators. During the past ten years a great deal of attention
has been directed to the excitatory amino acids (EAAs), principally glutamate
and aspartate, and their receptors since they are thought to mediate fast
excitatory transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. EAA
receptors are broken down into two major subtypes: ionotropic and
metabotropic. The ionotropic receptors contain ligand-gated ion channels
and mediate ion fluxes for signalling, while the metabotropic receptors use
G proteins for signalling. Classification of the ionotropic EAA receptors is
based upon the agonists (stimulators) that selectively activate them.
Presently, it is believed that there are three major subtypes: a receptor
responsive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors) and two receptors not
responsive to NMDA but responsive to Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic
acid (AMPA) and to kainate. The NMDA receptor controls the flow of both divalent (Ca++) and
monovalent (Na+, K+) ions into the postsynaptic neural cell although it is the
CA++ flux which is of the greatest interest (reviewed in Foster and Fagg,
1987; Mayer and Miller, 1990). The NMDA receptor has been implicated
during development in specifying neuronal architecture and synaptic
connectivity, and may be involved in experience dependent synaptic
modifications. In addition, NMDA receptors are also thought to be involved
in long term potentiation, CNS plasticity, cognitive processes, memory
acquisition, and learning.
