<ABSTRACT>
A hot-rolled steel sheet having the tensile 
strength of 34 to 62 kgf/mm² and being excellent in 

uniform elongation even after ordinary cold working 
into round or square steel pipe, section or sheet 

pile without lowering the productivity. The production 
process comprises heating to 1.000-1.300 °C a 

billet containing 0.04-0.25 % of carbon, 
0.0050-0.150 % of nitrogen and 0.003-0.050 % of titanium, 

having 0.0008-0.015 % of TiN with the 
grain diameter exceeding 1 µm dispersed in the matrix, 

and having a Ceq. (WES) value of 0.10 to 0.45 %, 
rolling the hot billet until the rolling is complete at a 

temperature above the Ar₃ transformation point, 
and either air-cooling from the temperature above 

500 °C or coiling at above 500 °C and air-cooling, 
thereby adjusting the area ration of the pearlite 

phase in the steel texture to 5-20 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hot rolled steel plates
and sheets for general structure purposes and welded
structure purposes excellent in uniform elongation after cold
working and having high tensile strength, and a process for
producing the same.With the significant progress of the quality and
production technology of hot rolled steel plates and sheets
for structure uses in recent years, demand for steel products
excellent in plastic deformability has increased more and
more, particularly in the field of architecture and civil
engineering from the standpoint of anti-earthquake design,
and steel plates and sheets are now required to have a high
strength, a low yield ratio and a high uniform elongation.To respond to the requirement, Kokai (Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication) No. 57-16118, for example,
discloses a process for producing electric welded tubes of
low yield ratio, for oil wells, in which the carbon content
is increased to 0.26 to 0.48%, and Kokai (Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication) No. 57-16119 discloses a process for
producing high tensile strength electric welded tubes of low
yield ratio in which the carbon content is from 0.10 to
0.20%. In either of these processes, electric welded tubes
requiring no heat treatment are prepared by producing a hot
rolled steel plate or sheet of low yield ratio, and cold
working the steel product while the strain amount is being
restricted so that the amount of work hardening does not
become large. Moreover, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication) No. 4-176818 proposes a process for producing
steel tubes or square tubes excellent in anti-earthquake
properties by hot working a strainless ferrite-pearlite dual 
phase structure, controlling the cooling rate after hot
working, and heat treating. However, all those processes
mentioned above greatly lower the productivity and, in
addition, the former processes markedly impair the
weldability. Accordingly, those processes currently do not
necessarily answer the requirements of the industrial field.In addition to the disclosures mentioned above, Kokai
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication) No. 4-48048 and
Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication) No. 4-99248
disclose techniques for improving the toughness of weld heat-affected
region by dispersing oxide inclusions in a steel
matrix. The oxide inclusions in the former patent
publication are 0.5 µm or less in particle size and have (Ti,
Nb) (O, N) composite crystal phases. The oxide inclusions in
the latter patent publication are 1 µm or
