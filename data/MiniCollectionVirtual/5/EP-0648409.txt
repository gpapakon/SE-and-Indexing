<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a safflower seed, a safflower 
plant, a safflower oil, a safflower seed product, a safflower variety 

and a method for producing a safflower seed. More specifically, the 
invention relates to a safflower seed having either (a) an oleic acid 

content of about 80% or greater or (b) a linoleic acid content of about 
80% or greater, relative to the total fatty acid content of the seed 

when the seed is produced at a mean temperature of about 70Â°F. The oil 
is derived from said seed and the safflower plant produces said seed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Safflower, Carthamustinctorius L. , is a highly
branched, herbaceous, thistle-like annual varying in height
from 30 to 150 cm. Safflower has been grown for centuries in
small plots over a vast area from China to the Mediterranean
region, and along the Nile Valley as far as Ethiopia. Since
1945 commercial production has taken place in the United
States, Russia, Australia and Mexico. Safflower has remained
a minor oilseed in terms of total production and world trade.
The crop can be grown under full mechanization so that the
production costs compare favorably with other oilseeds. In
addition, safflower is suitable for growth in drier regions
and thus provides a profitable alternative in such areas.
Altering the oil content, increasing protein content or increasing
seed yield are current objectives in safflower
breeding programs.Safflower oil is comprised primarily of palmitic,
stearic, oleic and linoleic acids, with the vast majority
comprised of oleic and linoleic acids. Two different types
of oil can be produced, depending on the genetics of the particular
safflower line. One type is high in linoleic acid
and the other is high in oleic acid. A third experimental
type of safflower oil contains about equal amounts of oleic
and linoleic acids. A high oleic acid concentration of
safflower oil is desirable when its end use is in the food
industry. A high linoleic acid safflower oil is desirable
when its end use is in resin and paint formulations. In all
instances, it is desirable to produce a safflower oil which
is low in the saturated fatty acids, i.e., palmitic and
stearic acids. Three allelic genes, Ol, ol' and ol, are the primary
genetic determinants of the proportions of oleic and linoleic
acids. The genotype olol has 72-80% oleic acid in the oil,
and the genotype OlOl has 72-80% linoleic acid. The genotype
ol'ol' has about 45% of each fatty acid. It has been discovered
that additional minor genes may be involved in determining
the fatty acid content of a particular safflower variety.
Knowles, P.F., J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc.49, 27 (1972) noted that
such modifying genes may make it possible to raise the oleic
acid contant above 80%, but probably not above 85%.Knowles, supra, further noted that although high oleic
and high linoleic safflower varieties are temperature stable,
there is a slight variation in fatty acid content depending
on the growth temperature of the variety. This variation is
illustrated in Table 1.
