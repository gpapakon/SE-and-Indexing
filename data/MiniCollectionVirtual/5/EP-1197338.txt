<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
container used as an ink container for an inkjet
recording apparatus, or the like. It also relates to
a liquid ejecting recording apparatus in which such a
liquid container is removably mountable, and a method
for disconnecting such a liquid container.There are various methods for supplying ink
to a recording head which ejects ink as recording
liquid. According to one of such methods, a liquid
container (ink container) is rendered separable from a
recording head, or a liquid supply line connected to a
recording head, and such an ink container is replaced.There has been known an ink container
structure such that a piece of porous material such as
sponge, or a piece of fibrous material, is stored,
preferably in a compressed state, in a manner to fill
the entirety of an ink container to store ink. Also,
there have been known various structural arrangements
such that, from the standpoint of improvement in
storage efficiency, ink is directly stored in an ink
container, or is stored in such an ink pouch which
deforms in response to ink consumption. For example,
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 9-267483 (U.S. 
Patent No. 6,145,970) proposes an ink container having
such a structural arrangement. According to this
structural arrangement, the ink container is a multilayer
ink container, the wall of which has multiple
layers separable from each other, and in which ink is
directly stored to improve ink storage efficiency. It
is made with the use of a molding technology such as
blow molding.There have been made various proposals to
prevent the ink leakage which occurs as such as ink
container as the one described above is repeatedly
connected or disconnected.For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application 10-278293 (U.S. Patent No. 6,135,590)
discloses an ink cartridge which is enabled to deliver
ink by being penetrated by a hollow connecting needle.
It comprises: a boxy case; an ink storage portion, or
the internal space of the ink cartridge, partitioned
by a plurality of partitioning walls; a connecting
portion, which is provided as a part of one of the
partitioning walls, and is penetrable by a connecting
needle; a stray ink catching portion, which is
independent from the ink storage portion, is located
within the case, away from the ink storage portion,
and holds the ink which has leaked from the ink
storage portion; and a connecting needle cleaning
portion, which is formed of wafer repellent elastic 
substance, and is penetrable by the connecting
needle.In the
