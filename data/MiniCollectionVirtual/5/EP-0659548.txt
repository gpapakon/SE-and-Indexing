<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a bimetal 
having a same or wider proportional temperature range than a 

bimetal using a 42 wt% Ni-Fe alloy as a low thermal expansion 
alloy, and a higher bending characteristic of a large bending 

coefficient than a bimetal using a 36 wt% Ni-Fe alloy. The 
bimetal is formed by bonding a Ni-Co-Fe group low thermal 

expansion alloy, wherein a total amount of Ni and Co restricted 
to a very narrow containing range is within a specific 

composition range, a thermal expansion coefficient at 30 to 
100°C is made similar to that of a 31 wt% Ni - 5 wt% Co-Fe alloy 

of a nominal composition, a thermal expansion is very small 
and 2 × 10⁻⁶/°C or less in the temperature range of 30 to 300°C, 

and further, a transition point is 250°C or higher and a 
transformation temperature is 50°C or less, and a high thermal 

expansion metal or alloy directly or via an intermediate metal 
or alloy whereby a stable and high precision thermal control 

can be realized in thermal control devices and the like, and it is 
possible to achieve the small-size, light and endurable devices, 

thus the bimetal can be used more widely.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvement of a bimetal
frequently used in thermal control devices and the like, and
more particularly to a bimetal which has a high bending
characteristic by using Ni-Co-Fe type low thermal expansion
alloys consisting of a specific composition range as a low
thermal expansion alloy, and is capable of enlarging a
proportional temperature range.In general, a bimetal which is formed by bonding and
laminating, at least, two or more kinds of metal or alloy having
different thermal expansion coefficients by a suitable method
and rolling into a plate or wire, has a bending characteristic
due to temperature changes responsive to the difference in
thermal expansion coefficients, and is used in a wide field such
as the thermal control devices, color adjustment of a color
television and the like.As the metal or alloy constituting the bimetal, a Ni-Fe alloy is
used as a material having a low thermal expansion coefficient,
and as a material having a high thermal expansion coefficient,
Ni, a Zn-Cu alloy, Ni-Cr-Fe alloy, Ni-Mn-Fe alloy, Ni-Mo-Fe alloy,
Cu-Ni-Mn alloy and the like are used in response to the working
temperature ranges. Also, for adjusting an electrical resistivity of the bimetal
responsive to its use, it is known to constitute such that, an
intermediate metal or alloy layer such as Cu, a Cu alloy, Ni, and
the like is interposed and bonded between the low thermal
expansion alloy and the high thermal expansion metal or alloy.Furthermore, it is known to constitute such that, when
necessary, a corrosion-resistance coating such as a stainless
alloy and the like or a getter material coating such as Al, Zn and
the like is formed on the bimetal surface.As described above, though the conventional bimetal is
constituted by bonding the low thermal expansion alloy and
the high thermal expansion metal or alloy with or without
interposing the intermediate metal or alloy layer
therebetween, in any cases, the Ni-Fe alloy is used as the low
thermal expansion alloy.A 36 wt% Ni-Fe alloy is known as the most common alloy
used in the bimetal as the Ni-Fe alloy (JIS c 2530). However, the
36wt% Ni-Fe alloy reaches at the transition point at about
200°C and the thermal expansion becomes considerably large
at temperatures above the transition point, it is
disadvantageous in that a proportional temperature range as
the bimetal is restricted within the range of about 150°C or
less.A 42 wt% Ni-Fe alloy is known as the Ni-Fe alloy having the
higher transition point of thermal expansion than the
