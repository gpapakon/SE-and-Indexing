<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a photopolymerisable material comprising     (A) a flexible, transparent base (support, carrier, substrate) film,   (B) a coloured, polymerisable layer containing an organic binder, a free-radical-polymerisable compound containing at least one terminal, ethylenically unsaturated group, and a dye or coloured pigment, (C) an adhesive layer containing a thermoplastic polymer and having a Tg of from 25 to 100@C, and (D) an uncoloured, photopolymerisable layer containing a polymeric organic binder, a free-radical-polymerisable compound containing at least one terminal, ethylenically unsaturated group, and a photopolymerisation initiator, between the base film (A) and the coloured polymerisable layer (B), where the cohesion of layers (B), (C) and (D) and the adhesion of these layers to one another and to the base film (A) have been set in such a way that the adhesion (a2) of the photopolymerisable layer (D) to the coloured layer (B) in the unexposed state is lower than the adhesion (a3) of the coloured layer (B) to the adhesive layer (C) and the adhesion (a1) of the photopolymerisable layer (D) to the base film (A) and than the cohesions (c1), (c2) and (c3) of layers (D), (B) and (C), and where the adhesion (a3') of the coloured layer (B) to the adhesive layer (C) in the exposed state is lower than the adhesion (a1') of the photopolymerised layer (D) to the base film (A) and the adhesion (a2') of the photopolymerised layer (D) to the coloured layer (B) and than the cohesions (c1'), (c2') and (c3') of layers (D), (B) and (C). The material is processed by peel-apart development and gives colour images (pictures, prints) having a lower background colour cast (discoloration).
