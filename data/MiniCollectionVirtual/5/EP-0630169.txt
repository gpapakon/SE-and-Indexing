<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to arrangements of electric connecting elements between various heating filaments and/or one or more connecting blocks as well as electrically conductive connecting elements and elements for receiving and locking these electrically conductive connecting elements for radiant heaters. Known solutions require a relatively high outlay in terms of assembly and locking facilities in order to weld the ends of the heating filaments to the connecting body. According to the invention, electric conductor connections (2) without insulating sleeves are arranged in the insulating body (1) during its production, as long as this insulating body (1) still has a powdery, pulpy or pasty consistency, depending on the basic material used, in the corresponding moulds. The conductor connections (2) are in this case arranged essentially in parallel and at a sufficient distance from the plane of the heating filaments (8) such that the legs (4) of the conductor connections (2), which legs (4) are bent off essentially at right angles at the conductor connections (2) in the direction of the plane in which the heating filaments are installed, emerge from the surface of the insulating body (1) at those ends of the heating filaments (8) to which the conductor connecting legs (4) are to be connected. Preferred embodiments provide grooves (13) for the insertion of the conductor connections (2) and mouldings (14) for closing said grooves.
