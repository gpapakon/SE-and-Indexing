assembly (10) comprises a mount (14) integral to the 

switch housing (12) for attaching the pedal operated 
switch assembly (10) on a brake pedal push pin (32). The 

switch assembly has a blade switch (16) carried in the 
housing (12) and a spring biased plunger (18) having a 

switch activation arm (62) integral to the plunger (18) 
and selectively engaging the blade switch (16). An 

actuation means (20) is provided for creating a 
mechanical advantage in operating the plunger (18) to 

reduce the brake pedal travel necessary to actuate the 
plunger (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle pedal brake 
operated switch assembly and more specifically to a self-adjusting 
switch assembly mounted on an automobile brake 
pedal. A prior art automobile pedal actuated switch 
assembly as defined in the precharacterizing portion of 
independent claim 1 is disclosed in EP-A-0 496 123. This 
prior art pedal operated switch assembly has a plunger that 
is directly displaced by a master cylinder push rod or a 
brake pedal to operate blade switches. Prior art brake 
pedal operated switch assemblies require about 0.050 of an 
inch (0.127 centimeters) free travel prior to operating 
blade switches. The automobile operator's foot feels 
approximately five times this distance, about 0.25 of an 
inch (0.635 centimeters) of travel, because of the brake 
pedal lever arm. Brake pedal travel prior to operating switches is 
undesirable because such travel delays the operation of 
switches for controlling safety devices such as brake lamps 
and cruise control deactivation. Additionally brake pedal 
travel prior to operating switches creates an undesirable 
loose feel for the automobile operator which can be 
interpreted as poor quality. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need to 
reduce the amount of brake pedal travel necessary to 
operate a switch assembly mounted on a vehicle brake pedal.  
 We have invented an apparatus and method as defined in the independent claims 1 and 5, respectively, that satisfies the 
need for a self-adjusting vehicle brake pedal operated switch assembly 
which operates with less brake pedal travel. The vehicle brake pedal actuated switch assembly apparatus has a 
housing for attaching and containing components. The housing has 
an integral mount for attaching the switch assembly to a brake 
pedal push pin. Blade type switches are contained in the housing, 
and a spring biased plunger with integral switch activation arms 
engage the blade switches to open and close contacts. The spring 
biased plunger is operated by an actuation means which creates a 
mechanical advantage so less brake pedal travel is required to 
actuate the plunger. The actuation means includes a lever 
pivotally mounted in the housing operated by the brake pedal push 
pin to actuate the plunger. The method of actuating a plunger in a vehicle brake pedal 
operated switch assembly is achieved by providing a lever having a 
push pin portion and a plunger end. The lever is carried in the 
housing so it pivots near the push pin portion, so a mechanical 
advantage created causes the

A vehicle brake pedal actuated switch assembly, 
comprising: 


(a) a housing (12); 
(b) a mount (14) integral to the housing (12) for 
attaching the pedal operated switch assembly (10) on a 

brake pedal push pin (32); 
(c) a blade switch (16) carried in the housing 
(12); 
(d) a plunger (18) which is spring biased having a 
switch activation arm (62) integral to the plunger (18) 

selectively engaging the blade switch (16); and, 
 
   characterized by:
 
   (e) actuation means for creating a mechanical 

advantage in operating the plunger (18) to reduce the brake 
pedal travel necessary to actuate the plunger (18), said 

actuation means comprising an actuation lever (74) 
pivotally mounted in the housing (12) operated by the brake 

pedal push pin (32) at an operation portion (80) between 
the pivot end (76) and the lever end (82), where the 

plunger (18) is actuated. 
A vehicle brake pedal actuated switch assembly 
according to claim 1, characterized in that the switch 

activation arm (62) selectively engages the blade switch 
(16) between a blade switch contact (56) and a blade switch 

terminal (58). 
A vehicle brake pedal actuated switch assembly 
according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the blade 

switch (16) is a plurality of blade switches. 
A vehicle brake pedal actuated switch assembly 
as recited in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 

that there are integral switch activation arms (62). 
A method of actuating a plunger in a vehicle 
brake pedal push pin operated switch assembly according to claims 1 to 4, comprising 

the step of:
 
   (a) providing an actuation lever (74) having a push 

pin portion (80) and a plunger end (82) wherein the 
actuation lever (74) pivots when actuated creating a  

 
mechanical advantage to move the plunger end (82) farther 

than the push pin portion (80) is moved by a brake pedal 
push pin (32). 
The method according to claim 5, further 
characterized by the steps of: 


(b) mounting the pedal operated switch assembly 
(10) and a master cylinder push rod (46) on the brake pedal 

push pin (32) wherein a mount push pin opening (34) and a 
master cylinder push rod opening (48) have a larger 

circumference than the brake pedal push pin (32) creating a 
clearance (44); 
(c) biasing the brake pedal push pin (32) with the 
actuation lever (74) having a spring load provided by a 

plunger spring (68) against the brake pedal push pin (32)

clearance (86); 
(e) holding the pedal operated switch assembly (10)

through the biased clearance (86) with the master cylinder 
push rod (46) having a spring load higher than the 

actuation lever (74);

master cylinder push rod (46) spring load to return the 
brake pedal (30) to a released position and simultaneously 

the actuation lever (74) spring load applied to the brake  
 

pedal push pin (32) returns the brake pedal (30) to the 
biased position creating the biased clearance (86). 
The method according to claim 5, characterized
