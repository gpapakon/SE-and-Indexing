<ABSTRACT>
An analytical device 2 for detecting analytes in a liquid 
sample is disclosed having a housing containing an assay 

membrane 12. The flow of liquids across and through the 
membrane 12 can be controlled by providing a relatively 

movable barrier 14 which in one configuration tends to 
block the flow of liquid through the membrane 12, thereby 

directing liquid across the membrane, while relative 
displacement of the barrier to a second configuration 

allows liquid to pass through the membrane, eg for washing 
steps. Additionally or alternatively, the membrane 12 can 

be movable into and out of contact with absorbent material 
18 so that in one configuration in which the membrane 12 is 

in contact with the absorbent material 18, liquids tend to 
be drawn through the membrane, while in a second 

configuration in which the membrane is held away from the 
absorbent material, liquids tend to flow across the 

membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analytical device. In the past, many diagnostic assays for analytes in liquid 
samples have been carried out using dipsticks having 
binding agents, eg antibodies specific for the analytes in 
the sample, immobilised at discrete locations on their 
surfaces. In use, such dipsticks are sequentially 
contacted with liquid samples containing analyte and assay 
reagents. However, the flow of the liquid sample and assay reagents 
across the surface of such dipsticks is uncontrolled, with 
the result that contact between the binding agent and the 
liquid sample or reagents can be inefficient. This in turn 
can lead to errors in detecting the analytes in the sample. Furthermore, the scale of some diseases, eg rheumatic 
disease which effects approximately 7 million people in the 
UK alone, means that there is a continuing need to develop 
cost effective and accurate assay devices to assist in the 
diagnosis of these diseases. Broadly, the present invention provides an analytical 
device in which the flow of liquids across and through an 
assay membrane can be controlled. This can be achieved by 
providing a relatively movable barrier which in one 
configuration tends to block the flow of liquid through the  
 
assay membrane, thereby directing liquid across the assay 
membrane, while relative displacement of the barrier to a 
second configuration allows liquid to pass through the 
assay membrane. Additionally or alternatively, the assay 
membrane can be movable into and out of contact with 
absorbent material so that in one configuration in which 
the membrane is in contact with the absorbent material, 
liquids tend to be drawn through the membrane, while in a 
second configuration in which the membrane is held away 
from the absorbent material, liquids tend to flow across 
the membrane. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention 
provides an analytical device for detecting analytes in a 
liquid sample comprising; 
(a) a housing having a port for introducing liquids 
into the device; (b) an assay membrane within the housing, disposed so 
as to be contactable by liquid passed in through the port, 
said membrane having reactive areas specific for analytes 
in the sample; and, (c) a barrier,    wherein the barrier and assay membrane are movable 
relative to one another between a first position in which 
the barrier blocks the flow of the liquid through the assay 
membrane, thereby facilitating the flow of the liquid 
across the membrane, and a second position in

as to be contactable by liquid passed in through the port, 

said membrane having reactive areas specific for analytes 
in the sample,

movable relative to each other, the movement causing the 

 
assay membrane to move into and out of contact with the 

absorbent material, so that in a first position in which 
the assay membrane is in contact with the absorbent 

material, liquid can pass through the membrane, while in a 
second position in which the membrane is not in contact 

with the absorbent material, the flow of liquid across the 
membrane is facilitated.

wherein the housing is divided into sections that are 

relatively rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the 
device, the rotation of the sections causing the barrier

of the sections is provided with grooves and the other with 

lugs adapted to locate in the grooves so that when the 
sections are rotated, the lugs and grooves guide the
