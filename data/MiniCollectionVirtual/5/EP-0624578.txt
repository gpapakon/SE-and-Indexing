<ABSTRACT>
Water, hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing impurities 
can be separated from impure propylene oxide (12) in a 

sequence of distillation steps. 

(a) a stream of propylene oxide and lighter impurities 
(16) is separated by extractive distillation with an 

alkylene glycol in first column (10), from water and 
higher boiling impurities, which can themselves be 

separated in fifth column (50) from the alkylene 
glycol which is then recycled; 
(b) the lightest impurities (22) are separated by 
distillation in second column (20); 
(c) lighter impurities (34) are separated by extractive 
distillation with an alkane hydrocarbon in third 

column (30), and the alkane hydrocarbon heavier 
impurities are separated from purified propylene 

oxide (44) in fourth column (40); and 
(d) the alkane hydrocarbon is separated in sixth column 
(60) from the heavier impurities, and recycled to the 

third (30) and fourth column (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the multi-stage purification
of propylene oxide. More particularly, this invention
relates to a multi-stage distillation process for removing
contaminating quantities of impurities from propylene
oxide. Still more particularly, this invention relates to
a multi-stage distillation process for the purification of
impure propylene oxide contaminated with impurities
including water and other oxygen-containing impurities,
e.g. propylene, propane, acetaldehyde, methyl formate,
propionaldehyde, hexenes, acetone, hexanes, methanol,
t-butyl alcohol, pentane, isopentane, pentenes, isopropyl
alcohol and t-butyl formate. The impure propylene oxide
is purified by a multi-stage extractive distillation
process using a C2 to C6 alkylene glycol and a C2 to C8
alkane hydrocarbon as extractive distillation agents in
separate stages.It is known to use alkane hydrocarbons having 6 to 18
carbon atoms as extractive distillation agents in the
purification of propylene oxide, (see, for example,
US-A-3338800, US-A-3464897, US-A-3607669 and
US-A-3843488). US-A-3464897 shows that an alkane such as
octane is effective for the removal of hydrocarbon
impurities having 6 carbon atoms, such as 2-methyl
pentane, 4-methyl pent-1-ene, 2-methyl pent-1-ene and 2-methyl
pent-2-ene. US-A-3843488 shows that alkanes having 
8 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 10 carbon atoms,
such as n-octane, are effective for removing hydrocarbon
impurities having 5 to 7 carbon atoms from propylene
oxide.It is also known that alkylene glycols having 2 to 6
carbon atoms can be used as extractive distillation agents
in the purification of propylene oxide. Thus,
US-A-3578568 discloses the use of ethylene glycol and
propylene glycol; US-A-3838020 discloses the use of
butylene glycols; US-A-5000825 discloses the use of
glycols having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethylene
glycol, propane diol or butane diol; US-A-5139622
discloses the use of triethylene glycol; and US-A-5160587
discloses the use of dipropylene glycol.The use of multi-stage distillation processes for the
purification of propylene oxide has also been proposed.US-A-3881996 discloses a multi-stage process for the
purification of propylene oxide, including a first
fractionation wherein light impurities such as
acetaldehyde are removed overhead, followed by a second
distillation step, wherein heavy impurities such as
propionaldehyde are removed in order to provide a second
distillate fraction, which is then extractively distilled
in the presence of octane zone to provide pure
