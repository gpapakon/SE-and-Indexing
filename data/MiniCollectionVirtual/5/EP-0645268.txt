<ABSTRACT>
A flap type pressure relief valve (10) comprises a 
frame (12) having an opening therethrough controlled by a valve 

flap (14,16,18) in the form of a flexible sheet of material mounted to 
the frame (12) along a first side of the opening to overlie the 

opening. The flexible sheet is joined to the frame by a 
connection comprising slots through the frame adapted to 

receive and retain tabs on the valve flap that extend 
through the apertures. The tabs are formed of resilient 

and compressible elastomeric material and have enlarged 
first and second retaining ribs (46,48) extending closely adjacent 

the respective slot on both side faces of the frame with a 
necked connecting portion (50) disposed between the first and 

second ribs (46,48). The connecting portion (50) of each tab is seated 
within the respective aperture and is under compression and 

completely fills the aperture and compressively engages the 
frame. The retaining ribs hold the valve flap in its 

assembled location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed toward the art
of air vents for vehicles and, more particularly, to a
flap-type check or pressure relief valve for controlling
the flow of air into and out of a vehicle.Flap-type check valves are widely used in the
motor vehicle art to relieve air pressure surges or peaks
in the passenger compartment which result, for example,
when the doors are slammed shut. The valves generally
comprise a simple rigid frame or housing which mounts in a
vehicle body panel opening and provides one or more air
outlets. A valve element in the form of a flexible sheet
is joined along one edge to the frame to overlie the
outlets on the side exterior to the vehicle compartment.The valve element sheets have been connected to
the frame using a variety of techniques, including separate
mechanical fasteners, heat welding processes, and molded
tabs. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,972,765 and
4,667,578 which disclose the various prior art connecting
techniques.Each of the prior techniques have one or more
disadvantages, such as general complexity, air leakage,
multiple components, and/or labor intensive assembly.
Consequently, there exists a need for a simpler and more
effective design for such air relief valves.The subject invention provides a flap-type valve
and frame assembly which greatly simplifies and improves
the relationship between the flap valve elements and their 
supporting frame. Through the use of the invention, the
connection between the frame and the flap valve is a
sealed, airtight connection and assembly is greatly
facilitated.In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a pressure relief
valve having a frame with a flow opening therethrough and a
valve element in the form of a flexible sheet of material
mounted to the frame to overlie the flow opening is provided
with improved connecting means for mounting the flexible
sheet to the frame. The connecting means comprises at
least one connecting aperture through the frame along a first side of
the flow opening and a tab element on a first edge of the sheet
extending through the aperture. The tab element, which is co-planar
to said flexible sheet, is formed
of resilient and compressible elastic material and has
enlarged first and second portions extending outwardly
about the aperture on both side faces of the frame with a
connecting portion between the first and second portions.
The connecting portion is located within the connecting aperture and
is sized so that it is under compression by the frame and
completely fills the
