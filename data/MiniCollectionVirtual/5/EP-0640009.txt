<CLAIMS>
The use of a mixture of a long-chain unsaturated 
dimeric or oligomeric fatty acid and of a C₆-C₁₂ fatty 

acid as solubilizer or solubility promoter for nonionic 
surfactants in alkaline aqueous solutions. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein from 60 to 
95% by weight of the C₆-C₁₂ fatty acid are mixed with from 

5 to 40% by weight of the long-chain unsaturated dimeric 
or oligomeric fatty acid. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein from 80 to 
90% by weight of the C₆-C₁₂ fatty acid are mixed with from 

10 to 20% by weight of the long-chain unsaturated dimeric 
or oligomeric fatty acid. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein 2-ethylhexanoic 
acid or i-nonanoic acid is used as C₆-C₁₂ fatty 

acids. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein dimeric or 
trimeric oleic acid or mixtures of these acids are used 

as long-chain unsaturated dimeric or oligomeric fatty 
acid.
