<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and a method for determining pore volume measurements of a solid sample. The device comprises a high-pressure cell (50), a sample holder (1) provided with an orifice (21), depressurization means (2) connected to an enclosure (10a) containing the sample holder via at least one orifice (30), and a mercury supply. The device furthermore includes a syringe pump (9) capable of delivering mercury under pressure, connected to the enclosure and to the mercury supply means, means (40) for programming a constant mercury supply flow rate during a determined period of time, which programming means are connected to the pump, at least one pressure sensor (15) downstream of the pump, designed to read the pressure at each instant, and the signal acquisition and processing means (41) connected to the pressure sensor and to the mercury supply flow rate programming means and designed to determine porosimetry measurements. Application in particular to catalysis and to reservoir geology.

Apparatus for determining the pore volume parameters
of a solid sample comprising a substantially sealed

high pressure cell (50) containing a chamber (10a),
a sample holder (1) provided with a closure

including a tube (21) which is open at its two
extremities and of a suitable diameter, the sample

holder being mounted in said chamber and
communicating therewith via said tube, means (2) for

creating a vacuum connected to said chamber, and
means (8) for supplying a non wetting liquid such as

mercury connected to the chamber, the apparatus
being characterised in that it includes pump means

(9) connected to the chamber and to the liquid
supply means for delivering said liquid under

pressure, means (40) connected to the pump for
programming a steady supply rate over a set period

of time, at least one pressure sensor (15)
downstream of the pump means adapted to read the

pressure continuously, and means (41) for signal
collection and processing connected to the pressure

sensor and to the means for programming the liquid
supply, adapted to determine the pore volume

parameters of the sample. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the cell
comprises two orifices (30, 14b), one of which (30)

provides communication between the chamber and the
pump means, and closure (14) including tube (14a)

which is adapted either to bring the second orifice
(14b) into communication with the chamber and an

expansion chamber (13) for said liquid, or to close
the second orifice.
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the cell
comprises a single orifice (30) which brings the

chamber (10a) into communication either with the
pump means (4), or with the vacuum creating means

(2), by means of an appropriate valve between the
pump means and the orifice.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the sample holder comprises a ground glass

closure (1a) including a small diameter tube (21)
which is open at both its extremities, and support

means in the chamber.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the pump means is a syringe pump. 
Method for determining pore volume parameters of a
solid sample by porosimetry, characterised in that

the following steps are carried out:

a) an empty sample holder is filled with a non
wetting liquid with a compressibility ratio

which is less than or equal to that of mercury,
such as mercury;
b) the sample holder is placed in a chamber in a
high pressure cell, the chamber being in

communication with the sample holder;
c) the high pressure cell chamber is filled with
said liquid using a suitable pump means;
d) the filled chamber is isolated;
e) a substantially steady flow of said liquid is
programmed and introduced into the cell chamber

by the pump means for a set period of time, and
the volume of liquid introduced is thereby

continuously calculated;
f) the pressure corresponding to the volume of
liquid introduced during said period is

continuously measured;
g) the sample holder is emptied; 
h) a known weight of a sample is introduced into
the sample holder which is filled with said

liquid;
i) the sample holder is placed in the high
pressure cell chamber;
j) steps c), d) and e) are repeated in the
presence of the sample in the sample holder;
k) the pressure corresponding to the volume of
liquid introduced into the cell chamber

containing the sample is continuously measured
during said period; and
l) suitable processing means continuously
determine the volume of liquid introduced into

the sample per unit weight for each pressure
measurement obtained from steps f) and k) and

the pore volume parameters per unit weight of
the sample are thereby calculated.
Method according to claim 6 wherein a steady flow of
non wetting liquid into the high pressure cell

chamber is programmed, both with and without the
sample, to be at least 10
