<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pipe which can be buried in the ground, in particular a plastic pipe, preferably a compression-resistant HDPE pipe for gas lines, which is provided with at least one sheath (4) which consists of a mat-like plastic fibre material and by means of which the pipe is protected against the action of sharp-edged stones or the like. If the mat-like plastic fibre material (4.3) is provided, in each part-length, with at least one metal element (8), then the progression of such a pipe in the ground can be easily detected at a later stage.

<CLAIMS>
A protective covering for a pipe which can be laid
in the earth, in particular a plastic pipe, preferably

pressure-proof pipe of HDPE for gas lines, which forms
at least one covering (4) of a mat-like plastics fibre

material, characterised in that the covering (4) is in
the form of a tube produced from the plastics fibre

material, which can be pulled loosely on to the pipe
(1, 2).
A protective covering according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the tubular plastics mat which is

produced from a bonded plastics fabric is dimensioned
such that it can be applied to the pipe in a push-pull

movement.
A protective covering according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the tube is formed from a mat

strip which is joined together via a longitudinal seam.
A protective covering according to one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that at least one end of the

tube is provided with a textile hooked band (6) which
is fastened to the tube, extending over at least part

of the periphery.
A protective covering according to one of Claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the hook side of the hooked

band (6) is directed against the outer wall of the tube
(1).
A protective covering according to one of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the pipe (1) is covered in

at least two layers with the plastics fibre mat
material. 
A protective covering consisting of a mat-like
plastics fibre material for a plastic pipe which can be

laid in the earth, having the features of Claims 1 to
6, characterised in that the mat-like plastics fibre

material (4.3) is connected to at least one metal
element (8) per partial length.
A protective covering according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the metal element (8) is formed

by at least one metal wire.
A protective covering according to one of Claims 7
or 8, characterised in that the metal element (8) is

-provided with an anti-corrosion jacket.
A protective covering according to one of Claims 1
to 9, characterised in that a plurality of metal

elements in the form of metal wires or threads having a
metal content are incorporated into the mat-like

plastics fibre material.
