<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to ionic complexes of ionizable emulsifiers with ionizable polypeptides and/or ionizable hydrocolloids. The complexes are useful as fat substitutes, food opacifiers, foam stabilizers and flavor modifiers. They are further useful as stiffeners for oils and oil-water emulsions allowing the use of normally liquid unsatured oils in place of saturated fats in food compositions such as shortenings and spreads.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IONIC COMPLEXES OF lONIZABLE EMULSIFIERS WITH lONIZABLE POLYPEPTIDES AND/OR lONIZABLE HYDROCOLLOIDS Background of the Invention The present invention relates to ionic complexes comprising emulsifiers. More particularly, it refers to ionic complexes of ionizable emulsifiers with ionizable polypeptides and/or ionizable hydrocolloids.Our society, with its preoccupation with health and especially excess body weight, has generated a large demand for foods consonant with this outlook. Foremost in this regard are foods with reduced levels of calories and fat which retain the desirable organoleptic properties of traditional calorie- and fat-rich foods. Fat performs a number of functions in food. It is a major contributor to the mouthfeel and texture of many foods. Additionally, fat is largely responsible for the opacity and sheen of foods such as sour cream, mayonnaise and ice cream. In foods such as butter and margarine, the crystalline nature of fats provides the structure necessary for the product. In baked goods, fat is important for the desirable texture of many products and prevention of staling.However, consumption of high levels of fat is not consistent with desirable goals of avoiding excess body weight and maintenance of optimum cardiovascular function. The average percentage of calories from fat in the American diet has been estimated as 41-42% (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Nationwide Food Consumption Survey 1977 - 78. Report No. I-2. Consumer Nutrition Division, Human Nutrition Information Service, Hyattsville, MD (1984)). In sharp contrast to this, public health officials have recommended limiting consumption of fat to a level which contributes 30% of the calories in the diet. (U.S. Department of Agriculture/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2nd ed. Home and Garden Bulletin No. 232, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. (1985)).In addition to the overall fat level in the diet, the specific nature of the fatty acids comprising dietary fat has been the subject of much recent interest. (G. J. Nelson, ed., Health Effects of Dietary Fatty Acids, American Oil Chemists' Society, Champaign, III. (1991)). Saturated fatty acids have been widely implicated as raising plasma total cholesterol levels and unfavorably shifting the distribution of plasma lipoproteins from the desirable high density lipoproteins (HDL's) to the low density lipoproteins (LDL's) implicated in cardiovascular disease.
