<ABSTRACT>
A shift lever structure for operating an automatic 
transmission of a vehicle, includes a frame (11) fixed to a floor 

of the vehicle, a shaft (20) rotatably supported by the frame (11), a 
shift lever (30) and a select lever (40) connected with the automatic 

tranmission. Both the shift lever (30) and the select lever (40) are 
molded integral with the shaft (20) by the insert-molding 

technique. In the arrangement, the lower end portion of the 
shift lever (30) is engaged with the upper end portion of the 

select lever (40). In operation, a force applied on the shift 
lever (30) can be transmitted to the select lever (40) directly 

without intermediary of the shaft (20). Therefore, it is possible 
to improve the strength of both levers (30,40) and to decrease the 

strength required for the shaft (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shift lever structure 
for an automatic transmission installed in a 
vehicle as indicated in the preamble portion of claim 1. In a prior art, there is known a conventional shift 
lever structure as shown in Fig. 1 Referring to Fig. 1, a tubular shaft 1 is provided at an 
axial center thereof with a shift lever 2 which is fixed 
thereto to extend upwardly. The shaft 1 further includes a 
select lever 3 which is also fixed thereto to extend 
downwardly so as to be associated with a not-shown automatic 
transmission. At both ends of the shaft 1, bushes 4 of 
synthetic resin are fitted thereinto to reduce the 
frictional coefficient. By inserting a mount bolt 7 into the 
respective bushes 4 through a frame 5 and then threadably 
engaging the mount bolt 7 with a nut 6, the shaft 1 can be 
rotatably supported by the frame 5. Document FR-A-2665272 discloses an operating lever for a non-automatic 
transmission which is movable in a plurality of 
directions due to a ball bearing which is molded integrally and 
simultaneously with a main tubular lever body. A metal core 
protruding downward from the tubular main body is provided 
integrally with the tubular main body. Furthermore, sideward 
protruding metal bolts are provided at the lower end of the 
metal core and at a height corresponding to the height of the 
ball bearing, whereby the bolts allow connection of the 
operating lever with further levers associated to the 
transmission. In the above-mentioned structure of Figure 1, there is 
raised a problem that the shift lever 2 and the select lever 
3 cannot be mounted on the shaft 1 with high accuracy, so 
that the dimensional quality of the assembly is not stable. 
Because, in the structure, both shifts 2 and 3 are secured 
to the shaft 1 by welding.  
 In addition, since the above shift lever structure 
employs the pair of bushes 4, the mount bolt 7 and the nut 6 
as means for pivotably supporting the shaft 1, the costs of 
its production and maintenance are apt to be increased 
because of the number of parts constituting the structure. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a shift lever structure for an automatic  
 
transmission as mentioned above, which can offer a reduction of the number of 
parts contained therein by allowing the above shaft to be 
formed by resinous material, whereby the costs of 
manufacturing and maintenance can be saved. The objects of the invention described above can be 
accomplished by a shift lever structure for an 
auto
