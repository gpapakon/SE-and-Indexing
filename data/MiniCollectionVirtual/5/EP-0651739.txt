<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutically active hydroxamic acid derivatives, 
to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, 
and to the use of such compounds in medicine. In particular, the compounds are 
inhibitors of metalloproteinases involved in tissue degradation, and in addition are 
inhibitors of the release of tumour necrosis factor from cells. Compounds which have the property of inhibiting the action of metalloproteinases 
involved in connective tissue breakdown such as collagenase, stromelysin and 
gelatinase (known as "matrix metalloproteinases", and herein referred to as 
MMPs) are thought to be potentially useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of 
conditions involving such tissue breakdown, for example rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, osteopenias such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, gingivitis, corneal 
epidermal or gastric ulceration, and tumour metastasis, invasion and growth. Tumour necrosis factor (herein referred to as "TNF") is a cytokine which is 
produced initially as a cell-associated 28kD precursor. It is released as an active, 
17kD form , which can mediate a large number of deleterious effects in vivo. When 
administered to animals or humans it causes inflammation, fever, cardiovascular 
effects, haemorrhage, coagulation and acute phase responses, similar to those 
seen during acute infections and shock states. Chronic administration can also 
cause cachexia and anorexia. Accumulation of excessive TNF can be lethal. There is considerable evidence from animal model studies that blocking the effects 
of TNF with specific antibodies can be beneficial in acute infections, shock states, 
graft versus host reactions and autoimmune disease. TNF is also an autocrine 
growth factor for some myelomas and lymphomas and can act to inhibit normal 
haematopoiesis in patients with these tumours. Compounds which inhibit the production or action of TNF are therefore thought to 
be potentially useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of many inflammatory, 
infectious, immunological or malignant diseases. These include, but are not 
restricted to, septic shock, haemodynamic shock and sepsis syndrome, post  
 
ischaemic reperfusion injury, malaria, Crohn's disease, mycobacterial infection, 
meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic disease, cachexia, graft 
rejection, cancer, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, 
radiation damage, toxicity following administration of immunosuppressive 
monoclonal
