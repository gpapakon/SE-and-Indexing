<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of recombinant proteins 
in streptomycetes cells, in which the cells are 

transformed with a vector that contains a DNA 
sequence coding for the protein, the transformed 

cells that are obtained in this way are multiplied 
during which the protein is expressed and the 

protein is isolated from the cells or from the 
fermentation supernatant, wherein the expression is 

carried out in Streptomyces galbus DSM 40480. 
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein an 
expression vector is used in which the DNA sequence 

coding for the protein is under the control of the 
ermE promoter. 
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein an 
expression vector is used in which the DNA sequence 

coding for the protein is under the control of the 
ermE-up promoter according to SEQ ID NO: 1. 
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein an 
expression vector is used in which the DNA sequence 

coding for the protein is under the control of an 
inducible promoter.
