<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises at least one through hole (6) formed adjacent to 
a perimetric edge (4a) of one of the disc-shaped flanges (4) of a 

storage reel (2) carrying a cord (5) wound up on a core (3). The end 
portion (7) of the cord (5) slidably passes through the hole (6) and 

is fastened to the outer surface (4b) of the flange (4) by a clip (8) 
comprising a wire element (11) made of harmonic steel which is 

provided with terminal appendages (10) rotatably engaged to articulation 
seats (9a) defined in corresponding tabs (9) projecting externally 

of the flange (4). The wire element (11) is bent according to 
consecutively opposite portions (11a) so as to form a pair of retaining 

loops (12) acting on the cord end piece (7a) for holding it 
against the flange (4), as well as a counter-loop (13) acting against 

the flange (4) in order to generate an elastic reaction in the clip 
(8) thereby causing the end piece (7a) to be held fast by the retaining 

loops (12) themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for securing an end piece of
a cord wound up onto a storage reel, of the type comprising: at least
one engagement seat formed close to a circumferential edge of a
disc-shaped flange of a storage reel, said engagement seat being
arranged to slidably engage an end portion of a cord wound up onto a
core carrying the disc-shaped flange at the end thereof for fixing the
circumferential positioning of the end portion itself relative to the
reel; at least one clip secured to an outer surface of the side flange
and arranged to engage an end piece of said cord in order to fasten it
to the outer surface itself. US-A-2 265 393 discloses a
clip for clamping elongated or plate-like elements against a rest
surface (4) for said elements, comprising:
a threadlike spring element (11) exhibiting a pair of terminal
appendages (10),
said threadlike element
being bent according to consecutively opposite portions (11a) lying
in a common plane parallel to the plane of said rest surface in order
to form:
at least one retaining loop (12)
arranged to operatively
engage said elongated or plate-like element and secure it to said
rest surface (4b);at least one counter-loop (13) 
on the opposite side from the retaining loop (12) and
arranged to interact in opposition relationship against said rest
surface (4) for elastically counteracting moving apart of the retaining
loop from said surface (4), following the insertion of said
elongated or plate-like element between the rest surface (4) and
retaining loop.The invention is in particular but not restrictively referred to
storage reels of the type used for storage and transportation of
cords, generally made of a wire or similar threadlike manufactured
articles of an overall diameter in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 mm, which
cords are usually used in making reinforcing structures of elastomeric
material articles, such as motor-vehicle tyres, conveyor belts, pipes
and the like.It is known that cords used in the reinforcing structures of
elastomeric material articles are produced by suitable cord-making
machines which also carry out winding of the cord as it is produced
onto an appropriate storage reel. This reel lends itself to be then
used for the cord storage and during the transportation steps from the
production station to the places where the cord is to be actually used
and the reel will then become a proper supply reel for the machine
designed to make reinforcing structures provided with said cord.The reel essentially comprises a substantially

<CLAIMS>
A storage reel in particular for cords and other similar threads,
especially wires, comprising:


a substantially cylindrical core, onto which at least one cord (5)
is wound so as to form a plurality of coils disposed in side by side

relation and overlapped pack-wise according to a predetermined
tension;
a pair of disc-shaped flanges (4) for holding said coils, disposed
at the opposite ends of the core (3) and each exhibiting a circumferential

edge (4a) concentric with the core itself;
at least one engagement seat (6) formed close to said edge (4a) of
at least one of said disc-shaped flanges (4) and arranged to slidably

engage an end portion (7) of the cord (5) wound up onto the core (3),
for fixing the circumferential positioning thereof relative to said

reel (2);
at least one clip (8) fastened to the outer surface (4b) of a
disc-shaped flange (4) and arranged to engage an end piece (7a) of

said cord (5) and secure it to the outer surface itself;

comprising:
a pair of supporting tabs (9) projecting from the outer surface (4b)
of at least one of said disc-shaped flanges (4), at mutually facing

positions, for pivotally mounting an appropriate clip, and
a clip (8) comprising:
