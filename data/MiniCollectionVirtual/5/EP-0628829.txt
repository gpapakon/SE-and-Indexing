<ABSTRACT>
In an electric apparatus such as an electric 
power cable system, a high frequency pulse is induced 

on a conductive member such as a metal sheath, where 
partial discharge occurs in an insulation. The high 

frequency pulse is detected by means of a bypass lead 
wire, a metal foil electrode, a detecting coil, and the 

like provided on the electric apparatus without 
interrupting a live operation of the electric 

apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for detecting partial
discharge in an insulation of an electric power
apparatus, and more particularly to a method for the
use of a magnetic core to measure the partial discharge.An electric power cable system comprises a
plurality of electric power cables which are connected
to provide power cable lines by normal joints,
insulating joints, etc., wherein the power cable lines
are connected through terminal joints at both ends to
high voltage conductors. Each of the power cables
comprises, for instance, an electric conductor, an
inner semi-conductive layer provided around the
electric conductor, an insulation provided around the
semi-conductive layer to insulate the electric
conductor, an outer semi-conductive layer provided
around the insulation, a metal sheath provided around
the outer semi-conductive layer, and an anti-corrosion
layer of poly-vinyl chrolide provided around the metal
sheath. In this power cable system, the metal sheath 
is connected, typically, at the normal joints, the
terminal joints, etc. to the ground by lead wires.In detecting partial discharge in the insulation
of the power cable, a high voltage applied to the power
cable system is turned off to stop operation thereof,
and a detecting impedance is inserted into a selected
one of the lead wires connecting the metal sheaths to
the ground. Furthermore, an apparatus for detecting
the partial discharge is connected to both terminals of
the detecting impedance. Then, a predetermined high
voltage is applied to the electric conductor of the
power cable, so that the partial discharge occurs at
deteriorating or defect portions of the insulation,
thereby generating a high frequency pulse therein.
This high frequency pulse induces a high frequency
current flowing through the lead wire, so that an
electric potential difference is generated across the
both terminals of the detecting impedance. The
electric potential difference is detected in the
partial discharge detecting apparatus to diagnose the
deterioration of the insulation.In the other method for detecting the partial
discharge in the insulation of the power cable, the
detecting impedance is inserted between a coupling
capacitor, which is connected to the high voltage
conductor connected through the terminal joint to the
electric conductor of the power cable, and the ground, 
and the apparatus for detecting the partial discharge
is connected to the both terminals of the detecting
impedance. The partial discharge is detected in the
same manner as
