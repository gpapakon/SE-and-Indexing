<ABSTRACT>
A shipping container (10) for highly enriched uranium includes a 
heavy duty drum (20) containing insulation material (22), the drum (20) 

forming an outer container. Fibreboard and plywood form the insulation 
material (22), and are shaped and sized to closely receive an inner 

container (14) formed from stainless steel. The inner container (14) 
has a closure lid that is bolted on and forms a seal through the use of 

O-rings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to shipping containers 
for radioactive material such as unirradiated highly enriched uranium. Shipping containers previously used for shipping unirradiated 
highly enriched uranium were designed to meet the requirements of the 
US standard 10 CFR 71 as it existed before incorporation of new 
international standards (IAEA Safety Series 6, 1985 Edition). 
Containers that were used to meet the prior standards are typically 
steel containers with a threaded closure, with the steel container 
being centred in a steel shipping drum and isolated from the drum wall 
with fibreboard. These containers do not meet recent changes in NRC 
and IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) standards. This leaves 
a need for shipping containers that meet the new standards. According to the present invention there is provided a shipping 
container for highly enriched uranium or the like, the container 
comprising: 
a heavy duty drum; insulation material received inside said drum, comprising 
a first layer of fibreboard sized to be received in said drum and 
positioned across the bottom of said drum, a first layer of plywood sized to be received in said drum and 
positioned across the top of said first layer of fibreboard, a fibreboard cylinder open at each end and sized to be received 
inside said drum, a second layer of plywood sized to be received in said drum and 
positioned on top of said fibreboard cylinder, and a second layer of fibreboard sized to be received in said drum 
and positioned across the top of said second layer of plywood;  an inner container having one open end and sized to be received in said 
fibreboard cylinder, said inner container being provided with a test 
port; a closure lid sized to be received on said inner container; means for attaching said closure lid to said inner container and 
forming a seal therebetween; and a cover sized to be received on said heavy duty drum.  A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a 
shipping container for highly enriched uranium that can meet the new  
 
international standards. The outer container has insulators of 
fibreboard and plywood in a heavy duty drum that meets current NRC 
(10 CFR 71) and IAEA (Safety Series No. 6, 1985 Edition) standards. A 
drum that meets DOT standards 17C has a fibreboard and plywood liner 
that provides thermal insulation, impact protection, and axial support 
to the inner container. The inner container is formed from stainless 
steel and has a closure lid that forms a seal
