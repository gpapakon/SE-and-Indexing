<ABSTRACT>
The sealing of cartridges, in which a liquid is stored and from which the liquid can be conveyed in each case by means of a piston which is axially movable in the cartridge, is all the more problematic, the more highly viscous said liquid is because considerable internal pressures then occur during delivery. By means of pressure pieces (3) which are appropriately provided on the piston and are charged with the compression force (F) providing the delivery, the invention ensures that the pressing-on force of the piston against the wall of the cartridge increases with an increasing internal pressure.

A piston (1, 2) for a cartridge, in which a liquid, in particular a highly

viscous liquid, is stored and, by means of the piston (1, 2)
longitudinally displaceable in the cartridge, is expellable therefrom

as a result of the piston (1, 2) being subjectable to an axially acting
thrust force, the piston (1, 2) integrally comprising a hollow

cylindrical piston skirt (1) and a curved piston base (2) acting on
the liquid as a pressure surface on the piston skirt (1) on the side

thereof facing the liquid, wherein a pressure plate (5) is provided
which is axially displaceable in the cartridge and by means of

which the piston (1, 2) is subjectable to the thrust force (F) in the
direction of the liquid, characterised in that:


a) a plurality of thrust pieces (3) are provided on the inner
circumference (14) of the piston skirt (1) in such a manner that they

are uniformly loadable by the pressure plate (5) when the latter is
subjected to the thrust force (F);
b) the thrust pieces (3) are each formed as one-armed levers
mounted in the piston skirt (1) and extending obliquely inwards

radially and axially towards the pressure plate (5);
c) the piston is elastically deformable under the effect of the thrust
force (F), and in that 
d) the thrust pieces (3) are formed from a thrust collar (30) by
means of radial dividing slots (32) distributed over the

circumference thereof.
A piston according to claim 1, characterised in that the thrust
pieces (3) are uniformly distributed over the circumference (14) of

the piston skirt (1).
A piston according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the thrust
pieces (3) are mounted in the piston skirt (1) in the vicinity of the

piston base (2).
A piston according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the thrust pieces (3) are formed integrally with the piston skirt

(1) and the piston base (2).
A piston according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that an annular collar (4), to which the thrust pieces (3) are

connected, is provided at the transition between the piston base
(2) and the piston skirt (1) on the inner circumference (14) thereof.
A piston according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that radial lubricating grooves or pockets (13) are provided on the

outer circumference (11) of the piston skirt (1).
A piston according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that radial sealing lips (12) are provided on the outer

circumference (11) of the piston skirt (1). 
A piston according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that it comprises a rubber, a rubber-like material or a resilient

plastics.
