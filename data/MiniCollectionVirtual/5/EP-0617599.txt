<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic therapy apparatus including at least one treatment device (12) with at least one piezoelectric transducer element (14) for at least performing said therapy in order to destroy a target (16) such as tissue, and a controller (22) for controlling said device (12). The controllers (20, 22) for controlling said device (12) cause the treatment device (12) to deliver two kinds of ultrasonic waves, namely a first or thermal kind having a predominantly thermal effect on the tissue (16) to be treated, and a second or cavitational kind having a predominantly cavitational effect thereon. Internal or external benign or malignant tumours in the body of a mammal (M) may thereby be ultrasonically treated.
