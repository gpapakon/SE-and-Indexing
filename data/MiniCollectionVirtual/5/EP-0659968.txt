<ABSTRACT>
A hinge comprises a casing member (1) and a frame member (3, 
4) interconnected by means of a pivot (7), said frame member (3, 

4) comprising a lower part (3) secured to the door or window 
frame (5) by means of mounting means, and an upper part (4) 

secured to the lower part (3) and covering said mounting means. 
In order to efficiently ensure the above securing of the upper part 
(4), said upper part (4) can be inserted in or surround the lower 

part (3) as said parts tightly fit in one another. The pivot (7) 
retains the upper part (4) in a position in which it is locked to the 

lower part (3) because in the completely mounted position said 
pivot extends through flushing mating openings (6) in these two 

parts (3, 4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hinge of the type stated in the preamble
of claim 1.By known hinges of the above type, a casing member is secured
to the door or the window casing, and a frame member is secured
to the openable door or to the window. A pivot interconnects the
hinge members by one end thereof being inserted in the casing
member and the other end thereof being inserted in the frame
member. The casing member is screwed into the casing by means
of screws or the like means not accessible to an unauthorized disassembling
for purposes of burglary, said screws or the like
means being non-accessible because their heads are covered by
the portion of the frame member housing the pivot, viz. the bearing
member of the pivot.In order to ensure a correct positioning of the frame member on
the frame of the door or the window, the lower part of said frame
member is secured in such a manner that it is adjustable in a
direction perpendicular to the casing. The known hinges solve this
problem by the lower part comprising some elongated slots extending
in said adjustment direction. The lower part is secured to
the frame by means of hardware fixing the lower part to the
frame by means of screws being inserted through holes in said
hardware and through the slots in the lower part into the frame.
In addition, fixed pins are often provided in the hardware, said
pins also extending through the slots in the lower part and into
drilled mating openings in the frame. Thus, when the lower part 
is fixed between the frame and the hardware secured on said
frame, said lower part can be displaced against a strong frictional
force and consequently be adjusted in a direction perpendicular to
the casing. The frictional force is usually overcome by an Allen
screw™ being arranged in an additional slot extending parallel to
the remaining slots in the lower part. The Allen screw™ is of the
same length as the slot and is threadedly engaging a nut or bolt
secured to the hardware. As the head of the Allen screw™ is
accessible to an Allen key™ from the outside through an opening
in the lower part, said lower part is easily adjusted in the said
direction perpendicular to the casing, while, of course, the hardware
remains in position.Finally, an upper part hiding the hardware with the screws is
secured to the lower part either by way of fixing or by said upper
part being hooked to the lower part at the end facing away from
the pivot and followed by the end facing said pivot being secured
by means of a pointed screw. In the open position of

<CLAIMS>
A hinge comprising a casing member and a frame member
interconnected by means of a pivot, and where the frame member

comprises a lower part secured to a frame by means of
mounting means, and an upper part secured to the lower part and

covering the mounting means, characterised in that the upper part
is shaped such that it can be inserted in the lower part or

surrounds said lower part in the completely mounted position, and
that both the lower part and the upper part comprise flushing

mating openings for the pivot, said openings flushing in said completely
mounted position.
A hinge as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that in the
completely mounted position, the ends of the upper part form a

closure to the space housing the mounting means between the
lower part and the upper part.
A hinge as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the end
of the upper part and the lower part facing away from the mating

openings comprises coupling means interlocking said parts when
they enter a mutually inclined position before they are in the completely

mounted position, the mating openings flushing with one
another in said inclined position.
A hinge as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the
coupling means comprise an inwardly projecting pin on the upper

part, said pin engaging a notch or groove in the lower part. 
A hinge as claimed in the preceding claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the pivot comprises a circumferential collar

separating the portion of the pivot inserted in the casing member
from the portion of said pivot inserted in the frame member.
A hinge as claimed in the preceding claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that the end of the upper part facing away from

the mating openings is provided with a small opening for a tool,
such as an Allen key™.
