<ABSTRACT>
A railway wheel (10) with reduced axial flange 
deflection and reduced, thermally-induced, residual-tensile 

stress in the wheel rim, has a clearly defined relationship among 
the plate angle (A), the maximum depth of curvature of the wheel 

plate segment(Y), the location of the maximum depth of curvature, 
the wheel hub (14) and the rim (16), which relationship is provid
ed for 
plate segments both concave and convex with respect to the wheel 

outboard surface (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wheels for railway cars and 
more specifically to steel wheels having a structure to provide 
low axial flange deflection and low residual tensile stress from 
thermal cycling, which generally results from brake shoe friction 
heating on the wheel tread surface. Railway wheels are provided in various shapes, which shapes 
were generally devised for specific applications or to overcome a 
specific problem, such as wheel deflection and residual stress. 
Steel railway wheels may be machined, formed, wrought or cast. 
Each of the following variations or configurations of materials, 
shape and structure were provided to compensate for, or to 
overcome, one of the above-noted problems. Illustrative of an 
early attempt to resolve a plurality of problems in a single 
structure is the wheel taught and illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 
2,768,020 to Sylvester, which provided a cast steel wheel to 
compensate for or to overcome the inherent residual stresses 
generally attributed to cast steel wheels, as compared to chilled 
iron or wrought steel wheels. The wheel structure had a contour 
and form intended to hinder the formation of residual stresses in 
as-cast wheels. The structure taught and illustrated included a 
larger plate and fillet construction at both the hub and rim 
connections to the plate segment. In addition, it was noted that 
this disclosed cast steel wheel structure was to provide a wheel  
 
having an increased capacity to dissipate heat generated in the 
rim of the wheel as compared to earlier cast steel wheel 
arrangements. The Sylvester-'020 patent asserted a railway wheel 
form and contour with increased strength without increased 
material mass to accommodate higher wheel load capacity. This 
may be equatable to asserting a wheel with greater load carrying 
capacity without a concomitant increase in the overall mass of 
the wheel. In the illustrated structure of this Sylvester-'020 
patent, the plate or web portion has a generally straight cross-sectional 
area and the fillets are contoured or angled to 
smoothly blend into the rim to provide maximum mass at the rim-fillet 
engagement points. This cast steel wheel form and contour 
was to provide high operational resistance to thermal checking 
and cracking under severe loading and braking conditions. 
However, there was no appreciation or discussion of the disclosed 
wheel structure effect, if any, upon wheel deflection, that is a 
displacement of the wheel flange about the hub, with the increase 
in
