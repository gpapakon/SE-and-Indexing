<ABSTRACT>
An earth sensor is herein disclosed in which there is no
fear that mechanical resonance is caused, an attitude

detection can be stably performed at a high precision, and
compactness and light-weightedness can be realized.
The earth sensor comprises a substrate 31 which is
mounted on a satellite or the like and on which an image I of

the earth is formed by scanning the earth horizon; an
infrared detector 11 which is placed on the substrate 31 and

which detects the image I; and a signal processing unit for
processing output signals of the infrared detector 11,

wherein the infrared detector 11 has a plurality of pixels
32, 32, ... arranged at predetermined intervals in the

direction W-E which coincides with the scan of the substrate
31 and the direction N-S which crosses the scan at a right

angle, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an earth sensor which
is mounted on a satellite or the like and which can stably
perform an attitude detection at a high precision.Heretofore, as a system of a sensor for executing an
attitude control of a satellite or the like or detecting
pointing angles of an observation sensor, there are various
systems such as mirror scan type, static thermal irradiation
balance type, conical scan type, and mechanical chopping
type. Particularly, as for a geosynchronous satellite in
which long life and a high precision attitude measurement are
demanded, a two-axis earth sensor of a mirror scan type has
been solely used in many cases.Fig. 7 shows a constructional diagram showing an example
of a conventional earth sensor of the mirror scan type. In
the diagram, reference numeral 1 denotes an infrared
photodetector comprising a pair of single elements, namely, a
north scanning element for receiving lights which are spot
beams used for scanning of the north side of the earth and a
south scanning element for receiving lights which are spot
beams used for scanning of the south side; 2 an optical
package for enclosing the infrared photodetector 1; and 3 a 
mirror for reflecting lights L which are spot beams used for
the scanning, thereby impinging on the photodetector 1.Reference numeral 4N denotes a preamplifier for a signal
of the north scanning element; 4S a preamplifier for a signal
of the south scanning element; 5N a comparator which is
connected to the preamplifier 4N and which forms a pitch
pulse; 5S a comparator which is connected to the preamplifier
4S and which forms a pitch pulse; 6 a mirror scan drive
control unit; 7 a drive unit which has a drive coil and an
angle encoder and which outputs center pulses; and 8 an angle
generator (signal processing unit) for obtaining an angle
between the center of the earth and the west end and an angle
between the center of the earth and the east end on the basis
of pitch pulses PN and PS from the comparators 5N and 5S and
a center pulse PC from the drive unit 7.In the earth sensor, as shown in Fig. 8(a), a spot beam
SN is allowed to scan the north side of the earth EA from the
west W to the east E and a spot beam SS is allowed to scan
the south side of the earth EA from the west W to the east E.
The lights L which are the spot beams SN, SS used for the
scanning are received by the single elements of the infrared
photodetector 1 and signals CN and CS having a waveform Py as
shown in Fig. 8(b) are generated. Those signals CN and CS
are
