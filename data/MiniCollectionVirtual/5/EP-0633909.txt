<ABSTRACT>
A drawback of prior known carboxymethyl cellulose dispersions is that their carboxymethyl cellulose content is low, the stability is poor and the viscosity is too high for optimum use of the product. Now, those drawbacks have been eliminated by a new carboxymethyl cellulose slurry comprising: (a) about 10 to 60 %, based on the total weight of the slurry, of carboxymethyl cellulose, (b) about 40 to 60 %, based on the total weight of the slurry, of water soluble polyethylene glycol, the average molar mass of which is below about 1000 g/l, and (c) about 1 to 50 %, calculated as a solid and based on the total weight of the slurry, of an inert powder or dispersion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a carboxymethyl cellulose slurry
and a process for the preparation thereof.Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is often used in the form of
its sodium salt for modifying the rheologic properties of
aqueous liquids. The applications to be considered are the
clarification of water, the treatment of minerals, the
thickening of foodstuffs and medication, the thickening of
farm products, the use in oil drilling liquids, the use in
building materials, such as concrete, the modification of
ceramic materials, the modification of latex colours, the
use in paper coating and the use as a protective colloid in
emulsion and suspension polymerization.CMC has conventionally been delivered in dry, particulate
form. The drawbacks are hereby the formation of dust, the
poor dispersing in aqueous liquids and too long dissolution
times when dissolved in water.The same problems are encountered with the treatment of
CMC type powders as generally with dry particulate
materials. Since CMC type powders are hygroscopic and absorb
moisture from the air their particles can therefore become
agglomerated. It is very difficult to disperse agglomerated
particles in aqueous liquids. The dissolution of CMC powder
is difficult in other respects, too, since the powder tends
during the dissolution to form an agglomerate, the gel on
the surface of which prevents water from penetrating into
the dry powder inside the agglomerate and from dissolving
it.For the above-mentioned reasons users of CMC products can
require them in a form in which it can easily be dissolved
in the aqueous system of their process. The FI application 885969 published as FI 96318 presents the
delivery of CMC products e.g. in the form of such aqueous
dispersions that contain particulate CMC product, polyethylene
glycol having a low molecular mass (LWPEG), water and
polyethylene glycol having a high molecular mass (HWPEG). LWPEG
was defined in the publication as a substituted or non-substituted
polyethylene glycol being liquid at room temperature
and having a molar mass of about 200 to 700g/mol. HWEG was
defined as a substituted or non-substituted polyethylene glycol
being solid at room temperature and having a molar mass of over
3000g/mol.According to the examples of the publication the part of the CMC
(Na-salt)-product in the whole mixture counts for 20 to 23% by
weight. The part of LWPEG counts for 41 to 48% by weight, the
part of water counts for 29 to 33% by weight and the part of
HWPEG counts for 3 to 4.5% by weight. The molar masses of the
