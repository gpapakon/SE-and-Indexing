<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising a 
semiconductor body (1) with field insulation regions (14) formed by grooves (10; 24) 

filled with an insulating material (13). The grooves (10; 24) are etched into the 
semiconductor body (1) with the use of an etching mask (9) formed on an auxiliary 

layer (6) provided on a surface (5) of the semiconductor body (1). The auxiliary layer 
(6) is removed from the portion (11) of the surface (5) situated next to the etching mask 

(9) before the grooves (10; 24) are etched into the semiconductor body (1), and the 
auxiliary layer (6) is removed from the edge (12) of the surface (5) situated below the 

etching mask (9) after the grooves (10; 24) have been etched into the semiconductor 
body. Furthermore, a layer (13) of the insulating material is deposited on the 

semiconductor body (1), whereby the grooves (10; 24) are filled and the edge (12) of 
the surface (5) situated below the etching mask (9) is covered. Then the semiconductor 

body is subjected to a treatment whereby material is taken off parallel to the surface (5) 
down to the said auxiliary layer (6), and finally the remaining portion of the auxiliary 

layer (6) is removed. Field insulation regions are thus formed which extend over an 
edge (12) of the active regions (15) surrounded by the field insulation regions (14) with 

a strip (18) which has no overhanging edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor 
device comprising a semiconductor body with field insulation regions formed by 
grooves filled with insulating material, by which method the grooves are etched into the 
semiconductor body with the use of an etching mask formed on an auxiliary layer 
provided on a surface of the semiconductor body, the auxiliary layer is removed from 
the portion of the surface situated next to the etching mask and from an edge of the 
surface situated below the etching mask, and a layer of the insulating material is 
deposited on the semiconductor body, whereby the grooves are filled and the edge of 
the surface situated below the etching mask is covered, after which the semiconductor 
body is subjected to a treatment by which material is removed parallel to the surface 
down to said auxiliary layer and finally the remaining portion of the auxiliary layer is 
removed. Since the material reduction which takes place parallel with the surface of 
the semiconductor body is stopped the moment the auxiliary layer is reached, the 
insulated material deposited on the edge of the surface situated below the etching mask 
is not removed. Field insulation regions are thus formed which extend over an edge of 
active regions of the semiconductor body surrounded by the field insulation regions. 
These field insulation regions may be provided by processes in which no treatments at 
temperatures higher than 650 Â°C are required. Doping profiles already present in the 
semiconductor body, accordingly, are not interfered with by this method of providing 
the field oxide regions. Doped surface zones may subsequently be formed in the active regions of 
the semiconductor body surrounded by the field insulation regions. For example, a layer 
of a doped semiconductor material is deposited on the semiconductor body then, after 
which the semiconductor body is subjected to a heat treatment whereby dopant diffuses 
from this layer into the semiconductor body. Since the edge of the active regions is 
covered by a strip of insulating material during this, it is prevented that dopants 
penetrate to an undesirable depth into the edge of the active regions during this heat  
 
treatment. This renders it impossible for pn junctions already present in the active 
regions to be short-circuited. JP-A-63/185043 discloses a method of the kind mentioned in the opening 
paragraph whereby the etching mask and the auxiliary layer are subjected to an isotropic etching 
treatment before the
