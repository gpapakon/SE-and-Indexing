<ABSTRACT>
There is a wish to offer a video-on-demand service, in addition to the cable television service, to subscribers of a cable television distribution network. Since the optical fibre portion of the cable television distribution networks will not reach the subscribers (111) in the foreseeable future but will end in optical network terminations (ONTi) and will be continued from there to the subscribers in each case through an optical access network (108-110), the problem is how the totality of subscriber-individual video signals can be transmitted to subscribers so that these can receive the video signals in each case requested. According to the invention, the transmission takes place digitally in time-division multiplex and wave-division multiplex from the centre (100) via the optical fibre distribution network (101-107) to the optical network terminations (ONTi). In each optical network termination, only the part of subscriber-individual video signals which is intended for subscribers which are connected to the optical network termination (ONTi) is removed. The removed subscriber-individual video signals are modulated onto subcarriers (N1-M6) and are added in frequency-division multiplex to the cable television signals which are distributed via the electrical access network (108-110) to the subscribers (111) connected to the optical network termination (ONTi).

A cable television distribution network comprising

a fiber-optic distribution network (101 to 107)
extending from a center (100) to optical network

terminations (ONT
i
),
a respective electrical access network extending
from each of the optical network terminations

(ONT
i
) to a respective one of a plurality of
groups of subscribers (111) for distributing a

composite cable television signal to the
subscribers, and
means (120 to 125) in the center (100) for
transmitting, in addition to cable television

signals (KTV), subscriber-assigned video signals
together with the composite cable television

signal to the optical network terminations (ONT
i
)
using wavelength-division multiplexing,
characterized in that
 the center
(100) includes means (123 to 126) for making available

the subscriber-assigned video signals as digital
signals, for combining the entirety of digital

subscriber-assigned video signals intended for
subscribers connected to the optical network 

terminations (ONT
i
) into a time-division-multiplexed
signal (ZM), and for optically distributing the signal

(ZM) with the composite cable television signal to the
optical network terminations (ONT
i
) using wavelength-division
multiplexing and different wavelengths for

the composite cable television signal and the time-division-multiplexed
signal, and that each optical

network termination (ONT
i
) includes means (130 to 136,
M
1
 to M
6
) for receiving the time-division-multiplexed
signal (ZM), for extracting therefrom the video

signals (G
i
) intended for subscribers connected to the
optical network termination (ONT
i
), and for frequency-division-multiplexing
said extracted video signals

with the composite cable television signal which is
distributed from the optical network termination (ONT
1
)
to the subscribers (111) connected to said optical

network termination (ONT
1
).
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in claim 1,

characterized in that the center (100) further
includes:


for each optical network termination (ONT
i
) a
channel multiplexer (KM
1
 to KM
64
) which combines
the video signals (KG
i
) intended for subscribers
(111) connected to the respective optical network

termination (ONT
i
) into a group multiplex
signal (G
i
) using time-division multiplexing; and
a group multiplexer (GM) which combines the
group multiplex signals (G
1
 to G
64
) into said
time-division-multiplexed signal (ZM) (Fig. 2).
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in claim 2,
 
characterized in that in the group multiplexer (GM),

the group multiplex signals (G
1
 to G
64
) are bit-interleaved.
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in claim 2,

characterized in that the means in each optical
network termination (ONT
i
) include:

a selector (133) which extracts the video signals
intended for subscribers connected to the optical

network termination (ONT
i
) as the group multiplex
signal (G
i
) from the time-division-multiplexed
signal (ZM);
a channel demultiplexer (134) which separates
the group multiplex signal (G
i
) into the
individual digital video signals;
modulators (M
1
 to M
6
) which each modulate one of
the digital video signals onto a subcarrier; and
power combiners (135, 136) which combine the
modulated subcarriers with the composite cable

television signal using frequency-division
multiplexing.
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in claim 4,

characterized in that each of the modulators (M

modulates the digital video signal onto the subcarrier

by amplitude-shift keying, and that the subcarriers lie
in a frequency range (VOD, Fig. 3) which is not

occupied by the composite cable television signal. 
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in any one of the preceding claims, characterized in

that it is designed to transmit audio signals instead
of or in addition to the subscriber-assigned video

signals in a corresponding manner.
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the means making

available the digital video signals and/or the means
(Fig. 2) forming the time-division-multiplexed signal

are located remote from the center.
A cable television distribution network as claimed
in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the means making

available the digital video signals and/or the means
