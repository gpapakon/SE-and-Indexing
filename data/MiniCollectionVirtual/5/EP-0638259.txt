<CLAIMS>
Hair roller for permanent waves having a roller body (1), which has two roller body
ends (3) and onto which the hair can be rolled, 
characterized in that
 there is sealed to
the roller body (1) just one single, thermoplastic foil strip (5), which is impermeable to

liquid and extends between the two roller body ends (3) and which can be rolled onto the
roller body (1) together with hair over such a length that previously waved hair is kept

separate from the regrowth.
Hair roller according to claim 1, characterized in that the roller body (1) is surrounded
by a fixing band (8), especially having projecting hooks, spikes and/or bristles (6a).

a strip, projects laterally over the roller body (1) and especially extends approximately

parallel to the foil strip (5).

Hair roller according to claim 5, characterized in that the back of the fixing band (8), by
means of coating or combining with thermoplastic foil, is rendered impermeable to liquid.
Hair roller according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the foil strip (5) made from a
relatively stiff fixing band simultaneously forms the roller body (1). 
Hair roller according to any one of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the roller
body (9) is formed by the foil strip (5) and/or the fixing band (8), which have on their

outer face a fixing region, especially having projecting hooks, spikes and/or bristles.
Hair roller according to claim 8, characterized in that the foil strip (5) and/or the fixing
band (8) are a foil composite.
