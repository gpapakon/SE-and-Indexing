<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a catalytically active gas diffusion electrode, a gas-permeable membrane is first covered with a structuring mask which is provided with recesses 2, 3, 4 corresponding to the intended electrode surfaces. A conductive electrode pattern, structured corresponding to the recesses 2, 3, 4, is then generated on the membrane by vapour deposition (evaporation) or cathodic sputtering of a conductive substance under vacuum conditions. The conductive electrode pattern located on the membrane is thereupon, by electrolytic deposition, electroplated with the catalyst and subsequently made hydrophobic.

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing catalytically active 
gas diffusion electrodes for electrochemical cells in 

which a gas permeable membrane is coated with a catalyst, 
characterized by 


a) covering the membrane with a structuring mask 
(1) which has openings or cutouts (2, 3, 4) 

corresponding to planned electrode areas; 
b) producing a conductive electrode pattern on the 
membrane corresponding to the openings (2, 3, 

4) using vapor deposition or cathode sputtering 
(sputtering) of a conductive substance in a 

vacuum; 
c) galvanically coating the conductive electrode 
pattern on the membrane with the catalyst; and 
d) making the galvanically deposited, 
catalytically active electrode pattern 

hydrophobic. 
A process as defined in claim 1, characterized in 

that the step of making the catalytically active 
electrode pattern hydrophobic is achieved by applying and 

subsequently drying a polymer dispersion. 
A process as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by galvanically coating various partial 

electrode surfaces of the electrode pattern with various 
catalysts.
