<ABSTRACT>
An optical deflector comprises a deflector (1) for 
deflecting an optical beam, a cover (2) provided with a 

cylindrical portion (2a) covering a peripheral surface of 
the deflector, an opening portion (3) provided in the cover 

to let the optical beam pass therethrough, and a nearly 
tubular projecting portion (4) surrounding the opening 

portion while opening outside the opening portion. 
Another optical deflector comprises a deflector 
for deflecting an optical beam, a cover provided with a 

cylindrical portion covering a peripheral surface of 
the deflector, an opening portion provided in the cover 

to let the optical beam pass therethrough, and a guide 
member projecting from the cylindrical portion of the 

cover along a tangent plane thereto. 
The optical deflectors can reduce wind noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
deflector for deflection-scanning for example a laser 
beam at high speed in a laser beam printer or the like. A recent progress is remarkable in increasing 
the operational speed of optical deflecting apparatus 
in laser beam printers or laser facsimile machines. 
For example, a rotary polygon mirror used in the 
apparatus rotates at such a high speed as ten and 
several thousand rotations per minute. Such high-speed 
rotation of rotary polygon mirror increases wind noise 
during rotation so as to cause big noise. Thus, the 
rotary polygon mirror is enclosed by a nearly 
cylindrical cover. Fig. 1 illustrates the entire structure of a 
general optical deflecting apparatus, in which a laser 
beam L emitted from a laser generator 110 is condensed 
by a cylindrical lens 105 into a beam of predetermined 
shape, the condensed beam is deflection-scanned by a 
rotary polygon mirror 101, and the deflected beam is 
focused through an imaging lens system 106 (106a, 106b) 
on a photosensitive drum 107. A part of the laser beam 
reflected by the rotary polygon mirror 101 is guided  
 
into an optical fiber 109 by a reflecting mirror 108 to 
be converted into a scan start signal. Fig. 2 shows the rotary polygon mirror 101 and 
a driving unit therefor. The driving unit for rotary 
polygon mirror 101 has a rotation shaft 111, rotor 
magnets 112, a stator coil 114 incorporated with a 
bearing device 113 supporting the rotation shaft 111, 
and a circuit board 115 for supplying a drive current 
to the stator coil 114. The rotary polygon mirror 101 
is urged against a flange member 111a incorporated with 
the rotation shaft 111 by an urging mechanism 116 
composed of a wave washer 116a, a flat washer 116b and 
a snap ring 116c, whereby the rotary polygon mirror 101 
is incorporated with the rotary shaft 111. The rotary 
polygon mirror 101 is covered by a nearly cylindrical 
cover 102, which restricts air flow caused by rotation 
of the rotary polygon mirror 101 so as to reduce 
occurrence of wind noise and to prevent the wind noise 
from leaking out. A window 103 through which a laser 
beam can pass is provided in a cylindrical portion 102a 
of the cover 102. In the above conventional technology, however, 
the air flowing upon high-speed rotation of rotary 
polygon mirror inside the cover produces big wind noise 
because of friction with the peripheral edge of the 
window when it flows out through the window for passage 
of laser beam.  The present invention has been
