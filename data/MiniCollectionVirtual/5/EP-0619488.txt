<ABSTRACT>
The method and the device make it possible to detect the presence of de-icing fluid, water, melting snow or ice on the surface of a structure. The device comprises a probe (10) having a delay block (16) which has an interface flush with the surface of the structure, and transducers (20,22) for emission and reception. The block has an acoustical impedance lying between 2.7 and 3. Excitation and analysis means (12) make it possible to send an electrical pulse to the emission transducer (20) and compare the amplitude and phase of the interface echo with a reference echo corresponding to the absence of contaminant.

A method for detecting and identifying a contaminant 

on a surface of a structure, comprising directing a 
burst of ultrasounds toward the interface through a block 

of material (16) that constitutes a delay line, characterized 
by giving, to the material, an acoustic impedance 

that is intermediate between the impedance of defrosting 
and antifrost liquids and the impedance of ice, comparing 

the amplitude of the echo obtained on the interface, at an 
oblique angle of incidence, with those of the incident 

burst or of a reference echo as obtained using a clean 
surface, and determining whether the echo has been subjected 

to a phase inversion. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that, during a preliminary calibration step, the echo 

obtained with a clean surface is stored and the amplitude 
and the sign of a first peak of the echo is measured. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
by measuring the time interval separating the echo on said 

interface and the echo on the surface of contact of the 
contaminant with air for deriving the thickness of the 

contaminant layer. 
Apparatus for detecting and identifying a 
contaminant on the surface of a structure, comprising a 

probe (10) having a delay block (16) exhibiting an interface 
apt to be placed flush with the surface, provided 

with transducing means and comprising energizing and 
analyzing means (12), characterized in that the probe comprises 

transmission and reception transducers (20-22) 
which are located orthogonally each to one of two faces of 

the delay block having a same slope with respect to the 
interface, the block being of a material having an acoustic 

impedance between 2.7 and 3 x 10

.s, and in that 
the energization and analysis means are arranged for 

sending an electrical energization pulse to the transmission  
 

transducers and for comparing the amplitude and the 
phase of the interface echo with a reference echo corresponding 

to absence of contaminant or with the ultrasound 
signal originating from the transmission transducer. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the delay block (16) is made of polysulfone. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the faces of the block are angularly located 

for the incidence angle on the interface to be close to 
the total reflection angle for longitudinal waves for the 

material/ice dioptre. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the energization and analysis means comprise 

means (40) for storing a reference echo obtained 
with a clean surface. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-7, 
characterized in that the transmission transducer or each 

transmission transducer (20) is dampened and in that the 
energization means are arranged for delivering short 

pulses to the transmission transducer. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-8, 
characterized in that the analysis means are arranged for 

measuring the time interval which separates the echo due 
to reflection on the interface and the echo due to reflection 

on the surface of the contaminant and for deriving 
the thickness of the contaminant therefrom. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-9, 
characterized in that it comprises means (24) for measuring 

the temperature of the delay block (16) and means for 
correcting the measurements responsive to a temperature. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-10, 
characterized in that it comprises self-testing means for 

checking whether an echo is present responsive to each 
energization of the transmission transducer or each transmission 

transducer.
