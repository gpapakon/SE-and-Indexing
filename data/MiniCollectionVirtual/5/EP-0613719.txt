<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a nickel compound to be used as a 
catalyst for cyanation reactions, said nickel compound having 

a central nickel atom complexed by a diphosphine ligand. In 
said diphosphine ligand the P-atoms are interconnected through 

an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic bivalent radical. 
The invention also relates to the use of said nickel compound 

and to a method of preparing an aromatic cyanide from an 
aromatic halide and an alkali metal cyanide in a substantially 

anhydrous non-dipolar aprotic solvent under the influence of a 
phosphine-nickel catalyst and in the presence of a salt of a 

transition metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a nickel compound to be used as a 
catalyst for the cyanation, in particular of aromatic halides, 
and to a method of preparing said compound. The invention 
further relates to a method of preparing an aromatic cyanide 
by reacting an aromatic halide with an alkali metal cyanide 
under the influence of a phosphine-nickel catalyst. It is well-known that certain nickel complexes can catalyse 
the cyanation of aromatic halides, i.e. the conversion of 
aromatic halides into the corresponding aromatic cyanides 
under the influence of an alkali metal cyanide. Cassar and coworkers (Adv. in Chem. Series 1974, 132, 252-273) 
have extensively studied the nickel-catalyzed cyanation of 
aromatic halides. In addition to nickel(0) complexes with 
triphenylphosphine and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine as ligands, 
these authors have investigated the use of nickel, complexed 
with two molecules 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane. This last 
compound appeared to be less effective than the former 
compounds in the cyanation of 1-chloronaphthalene under the 
conditions applied, viz. in ethanol at 60°C. This result is 
not an impetus for further research into the use of 
diphosphines as ligands for nickel(0) complexes. Also the 
mechanism of the nickel-catalysed cyanation, as suggested by 
Cassar et al., is not stimulating for any further 
investigation in this direction. In this mechanism a five 
coordinated nickel complex is postulated as an intermediate, 
wherein the diarylphosphine ligands are perpendicularly 
positioned on the planar structure, formed by nickel with its 
remaining ligands, and consequently are in the trans position 
to each other. More recently, Cassar and coworkers have reported the nickel-catalyzed 
cyanation of aromatic halides under phase-transfer 
conditions: J. Organometal. Chem. 1979, 173, 335-339. The  
 
presence of a phase-transfer catalyst, viz. an ammonium salt 
or a crown ether, should make the process more attractive for 
the industrial production of aromatic cyanides. Nevertheless, 
in a suitable solvent, viz. benzene, the cyanation occurs only 
if the NaCN is added slowly to keep the NaCN-concentration in 
the aqueous phase below approx. 0.1 mol/l. This is, of course, 
not favourable for the realization of a process on an 
industrial scale. Sakakitara et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1988, 61, 1985-1990) 
suggest, that the cyanide ion itself has an inhibitory action 
on the catalyst activity. In an attempt to avoid this problem, 
Sakakitara and coworkers have performed
