<ABSTRACT>
A pagewidth thermal ink jet printhead for an ink jet printer is disclosed. The 
printhead is of the type assembled from fully functional roofshooter type printhead subunits 

(26A) fixedly mounted on the surface of one side (67) of a structural bar (62). A passageway (64) is 
formed adjacent the bar side surface containing the printhead subunits with openings (65) 

provided between the passageway and the ink inlets of the printhead subunits, mounted thereon 
so that ink supplied to the passageway in the bar will maintain the individual subunits full of ink. 

The size of the printing zone for color printing is minimized because the roofshooter printhead 
subunits are mounted on one edge of the structural bar and may be stacked one on top of the 

other without need to provide space for the printhead subunits and/or ink supply lines. In 
addition, the structural bar thickness (T) enables the bar to be massive enough to prevent warping 

because of printhead operating temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal ink jet printing on demand, and more particularly 
to pagewidth thermal ink jet printheads. There are two general configurations for thermal, drop-on-demand, ink jet 
printheads. In one configuration, droplets are propelled from nozzles in a direction parallel to 
the flow of ink in ink channels and parallel to the surface of the bubble-generating heating 
elements of the printhead, such as, for example, the printhead configuration disclosed in U.S. 
Reissue Patent RE 32,572 to Hawkins et al. and schematically shown in Figure 1. This 
configuration is sometimes referred to as an edge or side shooter. The other thermal ink jet 
configuration propels droplets from nozzles in a direction normal to the surface of the bubble-generating 
heating elements such as, for example, the printhead disclosed in U.S. Patent number 
4,568,953 to Aoki et al. This latter configuration is sometimes referred as a roofshooter and is 
schematically illustrated in Figure 2. It can be seen that a fundamental difference lies in the 
direction of droplet ejection. The sideshooter configuration ejects droplets in the plane of the 
substrate having the heating elements, while the roofshooter ejects droplets out of the plane of 
the substrate having the heating elements and in a direction normal thereto. U.S. Reissue Patent number RE 32,572 to Hawkins et al. discloses a sideshooter 
configuration for a thermal ink jet printhead and several fabricating processes therefor. Each 
printhead is composed of two parts aligned and bonded together. One part is a substantially flat 
substrate which contains on the surface thereof a linear array of heating elements and addressing 
electrodes, and the second part is a substrate having at least one recess anisotropically etched 
therein to serve as an ink supply manifold when the two parts are bonded together. A linear 
array of parallel grooves is also formed in the second part so that one end of each of the grooves 
communicates with the manifold recess and the other end is open for use as an ink droplet 
expelling nozzle. Many printheads can be made simultaneously by producing a plurality of sets of 
heating element arrays with their addressing electrodes on a silicon wafer. A corresponding 
plurality of sets of channels and associated manifolds are produced in a second silicon wafer. The 
two wafers are aligned and bonded together and then diced into many separate printheads. The 
printheads may be used in carriage-type printers for printing swaths of

A pagewidth, thermal ink jet printhead for use in an ink jet printer, the 
printhead comprising:
 
   a structural bar (62) having an edge surface (67) which confronts the recording 

medium path when the bar is mounted in the printer;
 
   a plurality of thermal ink jet printhead subunits (26A) mounted on the structural bar, 

each subunit having an array of droplet emitting nozzles (14), and a plurality of heating elements 
(20), the nozzles of the plurality of subunits defining a printing zone having the length (L) of at 

least the width of a page; and
 
   means (46) for selectively applying electrical signals to the heating elements of the 

subunits to cause ink droplets to be ejected from the nozzles,
 
characterized in that
 
   a passageway (64) is provided within the bar;
 
   means is provided for supplying ink to the bar passageway from an ink supply;
 
   a plurality of openings (65) penetrate the said edge surface and communicate with 

the passageway;
 
   the printhead subunits are roofshooter type printhead subunits (26A) mounted on 

the bar edge surface, each subunit having an ink inlet (25) aligned with a respective one of the 
openings in said bar edge surface, and each heating element (20) being aligned with a respective 

one of the subunit nozzles for ejection of ink droplets in a direction normal to the heating 
elements and to the said edge surface;
 
   the said edge surface (67) of the structural bar has a length at least equal to that of 

the printing zone, and a width (W) equal to the dimension in that direction of from one to two 
printhead subunits mounted on the edge surface; and
 
   the structural bar has a thickness(T), in a direction normal to the edge surface, which 

is greater than the width (W) of the edge surface and which is sufficient to prevent the bar 
warping at printhead operating temperatures.

printhead subunits are mounted on the edge surface of the bar in two rows in a staggered 

arrangement. 
A pagewidth printhead as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each 
printhead subunit has two rows of nozzles.  

 
A pagewidth printhead as claimed in claim 1, wherein the roofshooter 
printhead subunits are mounted on the edge surface of the bar in a single, abutted collinear row 

of subunits. 
A pagewidth printhead as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the structural bar comprises a main part with a groove in a surface thereof and a cover
