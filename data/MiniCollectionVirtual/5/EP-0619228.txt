<ABSTRACT>
A filling head (10) for loading food articles such as franks into 
individual packaging trays (12) is adapted for quick connect to a power 

system (70-80) and a loader parent machine (11). The filling head 
comprises an 

open frame (15), at least two spring (36) loaded flapper doors (35) 
hingeably 

attached to the frame, and a pusher bar (52,53) unloading system capable 
of 

operable connection (44-51) to the power system of the parent machine to 
intermittently discharge food articles from the filling head to the 

individual packaging trays positioned below the flapper doors. The 
pusher bar unloading system includes a drive rod (45) which can be 

connected to the periphery of a flywheel (55) by quick connect means 
(49,51) to 

run in a smooth continuous reciprocating motion to deliver an up 
and down motion to a horizontal shaft (44) slideably mounted on the 

frame and an associated set of pusher bars (52) and elongated pusher 
members (53). The elongated pusher members when at the bottom of the 

drive 
rod stroke, forces food articles in the filling head to open the 

flapper doors and drop the food articles into the packaging trays. 
The filling head has quick connect features (23,25,26) which allows 

the use of 
different filling heads constructed to deliver different food 

article arrangements into packaging trays.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filling head for food articles such 
as franks or other similarly shaped processed food articles of 
roughly equal size. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
food article filling head capable of quick connection with a loader 
parent machine to allow an interchanging of different sized and 
configured heads to accommodate desired packaging tray 
arrangements. Packaging machines for all types of foods are very common and 
have been widely used for many years. Typically, processed food 
articles have a uniform shape which renders them conducive to high 
speed automated packaging machines. The processed food articles 
move along a conveyor to a filling head and into trays, boxes or 
some other form of packaging container. Often, the containers also 
are on a high speed conveyor which moves the containers with the 
loaded food articles to a wrapping station or another processing 
station used in the ultimate distribution of the food to the 
consumer. Speed of packaging the food articles is of utmost importance. 
Any packaging machine must keep up with the supply of food articles 
being processed. It is particularly important for sanitation 
reasons to minimize the exposure of many processed food articles to 
the ambient temperatures in a packaging plant. Machines are known 
which can load processed food articles such as franks into 
packaging trays. Most have a filling head where the food articles 
are loaded, then unloaded into containers. The filling head can be  
 
configured to load one or more containers at a time. The 
containers themselves can be one of many different sizes to hold 
any desired number of food articles. Ideally, any filling head on 
a loader will be versatile enough to accommodate the varied food 
article packaging sizes and arrangements. In accord with a need for fast and efficient food article 
packaging, there has been developed food article filling heads for 
loader parent machines. The filling heads have quick connect 
features to allow a head with desired capacity and food article 
arrangement to be selected and installed on the parent machine. A 
limited number of interchangeable filling heads for a loader parent 
machine lends a great deal of versatility to the type of package 
containers, both in capacity and physical food article arrangement, 
that can be loaded. Most importantly, the filling head is able to 
operate at an increased speed and in a very efficient manner. 
These and other advantages of the filling head of the invention 
wil

A food article filling head for connection to a loader 
parent machine to intermittently receive a preset number of food 

articles and discharge said food articles into individual packaging 
trays, said filling head characterized by: 


(a) an open frame having quick connect means for ready 
attachment to the loader parent machine to receive food articles 

moving in alignment along an input conveyor of the parent machine; 
(b) at least two flapper doors hingeably attached to the 
open frame in a side by side arrangement to collectively form a 

substantially flat receiving surface to hold the food articles as 
they are loaded into the filling head from the input conveyor; and 
(c) a pushed bar unloading system capable of being 
operably connected to a power system of the loader parent machine 

to intermittently discharge the food articles in the filling head 
to the individual packaging trays positioned below the flapper 

doors, said unloading system having (i) a set of vertical slide 
blocks slideably mounted on rails of the open frame, (ii) a 

horizontal shaft rigidly attached at each of its ends to the slide 
blocks, (iii) a drive rod pivotally attached at one end to the 

horizontal shaft and capabe of being rotatably attached to a 
flywheel of the power system to run in a smooth continuous fashion 

to deliver a generally up and down motion to the horizontal shaft, 
(iv) a set of verticle pusher bars rigidly attached to the 

horizontal shaft, and (v) a horizontal elongated pusher member 
rigidly attached to each of the pusher bars, each said pusher 

 
member extending substantially the length of the flapper doors so 

as to be in an engaging position with the food articles when said 
drive rod is in a lowermost position to force the food articles 

downwardly with sufficient force to substantially fully extend the 
flapper doors to an open position to cause said food articles to 

drop into the packaging trays and to move to a disengaging position 
when said drive rod is in an uppermost position. 
The food article filling head of Claim 1 characterized in
