<ABSTRACT>
A communications system employs a high-speed digital link with discrete multiple 
tone (DMT) the outward paths from a central transmitter/receiver to further 

transmitter/receivers receiving signals therefrom using one set of carrier frequency 
channels and the return signal paths using a different set of carrier frequency channels. 
In one form the central transmitter/receiver is an exchange and the further 
transmitter/receivers are subscribers connected to the exchange.

<DESCRIPTION>
For the past few years there has been interest in transmitting and receiving high-speed
data over telephone wires to individual subscribers without having to provide
higher-quality cables. High speed in this context means rates such as 1.5Mb/s (USA),
2 Mb/s (Europe). Two systems have emerged:
1) High-speed digital subscribers line (HDSL). The equipments at each end of the
line are nominally indentical. They transmit and receive data simultaneously
at the same rates, ie full duplex. It is expected that two or three lines will be
needed to achieve the desired capacity, each signalling at 50% or 33%
respectively relative to a single-line implementation.2) Asymmetric digital subscribers line (ADSL). On the basis that most subscribers
do not have the means or the need to generate such large amounts of data, the
channel from subscriber to exchange is reduced to a low-speed signalling
circuit, typically 16kb/s, while retaining a high-speed channel from exchange to
subscriber. An obvious application for this is the transmission of a selectable
broadcast-quality video signal. An ADSL system has a much longer
transmission range than an HDSL system of the same baud rate as will be
discussed later.Transmission standards are still under discussion. For HDSL the main
contenders are pulse-amplitude modulation, probably 2B1Q as used on ISDN, or
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) (and a recent variant termed carrierless
amplitude/phase modulation (CAP). For ADSL it is most likely that the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) will specify discrete multiple tone (DMT).DMT is fully described in tutorial paper T1E1.4/91-157 "A Multicarrier Primer"
J.M. Cioffi, Amati Communications Corporation presented to Standards Committee T1-Telecommunications,
of ANSI and imported herein by reference, but its basic principle
is as follows:Successive blocks of the high-speed data stream are demultiplexed into a large
number of channels (typically 256). Each channel may be several bits wide and
different channels may be of different widths. Each channel is then QAM-modulated on
to one of 256 carriers. The carrier frequencies are all harmonics of the lowest one. This
composite spectrum is transmitted for the duration of the data block length. Viewed
another way, each subset of bits within the data block describes the amplitude and
phase of a tone burst at a frequency specific to that group. The tone burst lasts for a
data-block duration, and the tones are a simple harmonic series (Figures 1 & 2).The use of DMT with HDSL and
