<ABSTRACT>
Particulate material dispersed in a fluid is separated by means of an ultrasonic resonance field. In a 
typical arrangement, the ultrasonic resonance field is generated within a multilayered composite 

resonator system including the dispersion (S) in a vessel, a transducer (T) and a mirror (M). All 
layers are parallel to each other. The resonance step-up of the acoustic displacement amplitude in 

the dispersion is made much higher than the resonance step-up of the acoustic displacement 
amplitude in all other layers. This is reached by matching a composite resonance frequency of the 

multilayered resonator and the electrical driving frequency, while simultaneously mismatching the 
Eigenfrequencies of the transducer and the electrical driving frequency. As a consequence, the 

electrical power needed for the separation process can be dramatically reduced. Generally, the 
apparatus is suitable for all kinds of dispersions (solid, liquid or gaseous disperse phases) and is 

especially powerful for hydrosoles (particles in water) and for separation of biological particles 
(cells).

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally, the present invention is related to a method and to an apparatus to generate ultrasonic
resonance fields within a liquid. In more detail the present invention is related to an apparatus for
separating particles dispersed in a fluid. It is particularly directed to an apparatus capable of
continuously separating dispersed particles with physical properties (especially compressibility,
sound velocity, density), different from the fluid, whereby an ultrasonic resonance field is
generated within a multilayered composite resonator system including a vessel, a transducer and
mirror. Said vessel contains a fluid carrying the particles to be separated. Acoustic radiation force
moves the particles towards the nodes or antinodes of the standing wave. Optionally, secondary
lateral acoustic forces cause them to aggregate and the aggregates settle by gravity. Numerous
fields of modern technology require that particles be removed from fluid. Such separation
processes permit either the dispersion medium or particulate matter to be recycled. For example,
many industrial processes generate waste water which is contaminated by particulate matter. In
Biotechnology, medium has to be separated from biomass. The apparatus is in direct competition
to centrifuges and filters, as well as to conventional sedimentation processes using chemical
flocculants. The apparatus can also be utilized to sterilize biological matter and for the
inactivation of microorganism. In the field of sonochemistry the invention can be applied to
accelerate chemical reactions or interactions within the sonicated solution.Recently, great effort has been directed at the development of acoustic separation or treatment
methods to replace or enhance conventional technologies. The establishment of a standing wave
in a fluid results in the formation of velocity nodes or antinodes to which the particles are forced
to migrate by the radiation force, depending on their compressibility and density. (Most solid and
liquid particles move toward the velocity antinodes.) Nodes and antinode planes are at right
angles to the direction of propagation of the sound waves, and the nodes are spaced from adjacent
nodes by a distance equal to one-half of the wavelength of the acoustic wave in the dispersion.
The aggregating effect of ultrasonic sound within those antinodes is prominently known from
literature. From E. Skudrzyk, "Die Grundlagen der Akustik", Springer Verlag, Wien, 1954, S.
