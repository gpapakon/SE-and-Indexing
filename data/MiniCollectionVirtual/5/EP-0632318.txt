<ABSTRACT>
A storage phosphor system (12) includes a 
storage phosphor cassette autoloader (10) for use with 

a plurality of cassettes (20). The autoloader (10) 
includes first and second endless conveyor belts (64), 

which are spaced apart and which have a plurality of 
outwardly extending shelves (78) in vertical alignment 

so as to define a cassette read site (84) and a 
plurality of cassette retaining sites (86),(88). A 

drive (90) drives the conveyor belts (64) in unison to 
transfer cassettes (20) loaded in the retaining sites 

(86),(88) serially through the read site (84). A belt 
position sensor (100),(116) senses the position of at 

least one of the conveyor belts (64) and produces a 
signal representative of conveyor belt displacement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
equipment used in processing storage phosphors and more 
particularly relates to an autoloader for positioning 
cassettes relative to a storage phosphor reader and to 
a belt position control therefor. It is convenient to handle a storage phosphor 
within cassettes that protect the storage phosphor from 
extraneous light and damage. This is particularly the 
case for storage phosphors in which the latent x-ray 
image stored in the storage phosphor is read by photo 
electrically detecting an emitted x-ray image formed by 
scanning the storage phosphor with stimulating 
radiation. It is desirable to retain the storage 
phosphor within a cassette except during actual 
processing. A hooked extractor can be used with the 
storage phosphor cassette to move a storage phosphor 
plate to and from a storage phosphor reader for 
processing. It is desirable to provide an apparatus to 
automate the presentation of such cassettes to such 
an extractor so that a number of cassettes could be 
processed in succession without attention from an 
operator. It is also desirable that such an apparatus 
be able to accurately position cassettes sequentially 
to simplify removal and reinsertion of the storage 
phosphor plate and that the presentation apparatus be 
separate from the storage phosphor reader to permit 
interchange of units and reduce repair times. In a storage phosphor reader/storage phosphor 
cassette autoloader system, it is desirable that the 
cassette be accurately positioned relative to the 
access opening of the storage phosphor reader so that 
damage to the cassette and consequently to the storage 
phosphor is avoided during loading and unloading. 
Accurate sensing of the position of the cassette is 
therefore essential. Concomitantly, the position  
 
sensor and sensor control should be reliable, 
maintenance free, inexpensive and relatively simple. 
Sensor systems which rely on micro switches or CCD 
arrays can be unreliable, expensive, complex and/or 
require too frequent maintenance. There is thus a problem in a storage phosphor 
reader/storage phosphor cassette autoloader system in 
providing a cassette position sensor that is reliable, 
inexpensive, maintenance free and simple. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a solution to the aforesaid problem of the 
prior art. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided, in a storage phosphor 
system a storage phosphor cassette autoloader for use 
with a plurality of

<CLAIMS>
In a storage phosphor system (12), a 
storage phosphor cassette autoloader (10) for use with 

a plurality of cassettes (20) comprising: 
   first and second endless conveyor belts (64), 

said conveyor belts (64) being spaced apart and having 
a plurality of outwardly extending shelves (78) in 

vertical alignment so as to define a storage phosphor 
cassette read site (84) and a plurality of storage 

phosphor cassette retaining sites (86),(88); 
   a drive (90) for driving said conveyor belts 

(64) in unison to transfer cassettes (20) loaded in 
said retaining sites (86),(88) through said read site 

(84); and 
   a belt position detector (100),(114) for 

detecting the position of at least one of said conveyor 
belts (64), said detector (100),(114) including a 

source of light (114) and a position sensitive 
photodiode sensor (100) which is continuously 

illuminated by said source of light (114), said source 
of light (114) and said photodiode sensor (100) being 

located on opposite sides of the path of said shelves 
(78), so that as a shelf (78) moves past said 

photodiode sensor (100) the light from said light 
source (114) is progressively blocked and said 

photodiode sensor (100) generates a signal proportional 
to the light and dark portions of the photodiode sensor 

(100) area, said signal having a value representing 
conveyor belt (64) displacement. 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 wherein 
said conveying belts (64) are disposed vertically and 

said detector (110),(114) is located at the bottom of 
said at least one conveyor belt (64). 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 including 
a detection circuit (120) having a current-to-voltage 

amplifier (128) for converting a current signal from 
 

said photodiode sensor (100) into a voltage signal and 
an amplifier (130) for amplifying said voltage signal. 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 wherein 
said detection circuit (120) includes a driver (124) 

for driving said LED.
