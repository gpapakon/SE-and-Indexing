<ABSTRACT>
An electrohydraulic control device (76) for a drive 
train (10) of a vehicle (12) is provided. The drive train 

(10) includes an engine (14), a transmission (32), a source 
of pressurized fluid, and an input clutch (64) connected 

between the engine (14) and the transmission (32). The 
control device (76) senses the rotational output speed of 

the engine (14) and responsively engages and disengages the 
input clutch (64) as a function of the engine speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
electrohydraulic control device and method for controllably 
operating a vehicle, and more particularly to an 
electrohydraulic control device having an electronic 
control module and one or more manually operated actuator 
mechanisms for affecting certain modes of operation of the 
drive line of the vehicle through the electronic control 
module including the engagement of a torque converter input 
clutch. In one conventional mode of "inching" of a vehicle the 
transmission is kept in gear and the brakes are manually 
modulated by use of a foot pedal. This is undesirable 
because it requires considerable operator effort and 
because the service brakes experience a relatively rapid 
rate of wear. In another well known mode, when the 
vehicle's service brakes are applied by the depression of 
a foot pedal an associated disc and plate type transmission 
clutch is caused to slip so that the transmission is 
substantially neutralized. This is most often accomplished 
by the brake system fluid circuit acting upon an "inching" 
valve disposed between a pressure source and the clutch, as 
has been widely used in shuttle-type lift trucks. This is 
desirable since the vehicle's ground speed is reduced for 
more precise control, while the speed of the engine is 
maintained at a relatively high rate to enable a rapid 
response of the auxiliary equipment operated by the engine. 
However, controlled slip at a fixed setting of the manually 
operated control member in both of these modes of operation 
has heretofore been impractical. In another conventional method of providing inching 
capabilities to a vehicle, an input clutch connected 
between a vehicle's engine and transmission is provided. 
Typically, the input clutch is actuated through an operator 
pedal. The operator pedal acts to engage and disengage the  
 
input clutch, thereby, varying the power transmitted by the 
drive train and slowing the vehicle. However, the engine typically also provides power to 
vehicle systems other than the wheels, for example, earth 
digging implements or the steering system. If the operator 
attempts to accelerate the vehicle while performing some 
other operation, for example, steering or lifting a load, 
the load on the engine may be too much for the engine to 
handle and may "drag" or stall the engine. The increased 
load may also reduce the vehicle and that of its subsystems 
response. The increase load will also increase the time 
required by the engine to accelerate from low

A drive 
train (10) of a vehicle (12) including an engine (14), a 

transmission (32), a source of pressurized fluid, an 
input clutch (64) drivingly connected between the engine 

and the transmission (32) and an electrohydraulic control device (76), 
the device comprising: means for sensing the rotational output speed of 

the engine (14) and responsively producing an engine speed signal; valve 
means for controllably directing fluid under pressure from the 

source to the input clutch (64) controllably to engage and 
disengage the input clutch (64); and an electronic control 

module (78) for receiving the engine speed signal and 
controllably actuating the valve means as a function of the 

engine speed signal, for comparing the engine speed signal 
with a first predetermined threshold and responsively 

actuating the valve to maintain a first predetermined 
pressure (A), which is a fixed value which is constant for 

all engine speeds below the first predetermined threshold, 
within the input clutch (64) in response to the engine 

speed being below the first predetermined threshold, for 
comparing the engine speed signal with a second 

predetermined threshold, and for modulating pressure within 
the input clutch (64) between the first and second 

predetermined pressures in response to the engine speed 
signal being between the first and second predetermined 

thresholds; characterised in that the input clutch (64) is 
for controlling slippage across a torque convertor; and in 

that the electronic control module (78) is for responsively 
actuating the valve means to maintain a second 

predetermined pressure (B) within the input clutch (64) in 
response to the engine speed signal being above the second 

predetermined threshold, wherein the second predetermined 
pressure is the maximum clutch pressure available and is a 

fixed value which is constant for all engine speeds above 
the second predetermined threshold.
