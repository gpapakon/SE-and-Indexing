<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for producing a fibre-reinforced resin part by winding. - Moulding means (5) are produced which include a plurality of female shapes (1) each corresponding to an indentation in the part to be produced. - The shapes are arranged, one after the other, substantially in the form of a helix so as to form a continuous groove, and then the said groove is filled by winding fibres coated with polymerisable resin, rotatably driving the indentations about the axis (4) of the helix.

A method of manufacturing a part made from
resin and reinforcing fibres, said part having a main,

elongate direction and sections perpendicular to said
main direction having a substantially constant surface

area, characterised in that it consists of the
following steps:


moulding means (5) having a plurality of female
forms (1, 1a, 1b, 1c) corresponding to an imprint of a

part are made,
said forms are arranged substantially helically
one after the other so that said imprints form a

substantially continuous groove,
said groove is filled by winding fibres coated
with a polymerisable resin by rotating said moulding

means about the axis (4) of the helix.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that after filling the groove by winding, the

moulding means are placed in means for polymerising the
resin.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that means for closing the groove are placed on the

moulding means.
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised
in that a closing strip (20) is wound onto said groove

around the moulding means.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said groove is filled with successive layers

(13) of coated reinforcing fibres. 
A device for manufacturing a part made from
resin and reinforcing fibres, said part having a main,

elongate dimension and sections perpendicular to said
main dimension having a substantially constant surface

area, characterised in that it has moulding means
comprising a plurality of female forms corresponding to

an imprint of a part, said forms being arranged
substantially helically one after the other so that

said imprints form a substantially continuous groove.
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterised
in that it has means for closing off the groove.
A device as claimed in claim 7, characterised
in that said closing means are a strip wound helically

on the moulds.
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterised
in that said moulding means have a plurality of moulds,

each of the moulds having at least one imprint.
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterised
in that it has means for rotating the moulding means

and means for guiding the layers of coated fibres.
