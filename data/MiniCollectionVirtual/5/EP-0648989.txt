<CLAIMS>
Refrigerator (10) with a thermally insulating housing (11), which together with a
door (12), that is arranged to be closable, encloses a cooling chamber (14), which is

cooled by an evaporator (15) and within which a fixedly located compartment (17) is
arranged for a stock to be cooled, the opening (18) of which compartment is provided with

a divided cover and the interior space of which is accessible substantially by way of this
cover, characterised in that the cover is constructed as repository (30) for stock to be

cooled, the portions (31, 50) of which cover, which are formed by the division, are
removable from the opening (18) of the compartment (17) while being guided to be

displaceable.
Refrigerator according to claim 1, characterised in that the repository (30) is
subdivided transversely to its direction of displacement into a displaceable portion (31)

near to the door and a displaceable portion (50) remote from the door.
Refrigerator according to claim 2, characterised in that the portion (31) near to the
door is guided to be displaceable in the portion (50) remote from the door.
Refrigerator according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
repository (30) is guided to be displaceable in guide strips (70) at the side walls of the

cooling chamber (14).
Refrigerator according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
repository (30) is arranged at a spacing from the opening (18) of the compartment (17) to

form an air channel (24) between it and the base (16) of the housing (11).
Refrigerator according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the repository portion
(31) near to the door substantially covers the opening (18) of the compartment (17).
Refrigerator according to claim 4, characterised in that the displacement travel of
the repository (30) is limited on the one hand by co-operation of abutments (56) arranged

at the repository (30) and on the other hand of counterabutments (76) provided at the
guide strips (70), wherein the limitation, which is preset by the co-operation of the

abutments (56) and the counterabutments (76), of the extraction travel of the repository 
(30) out of the cooling chamber (14) can be cancelled by tilting of the repository (30) and

this is thus extractable from the guides of the guide strips (70).
Refrigerator according to the claims 2 and 7, characterised in that the abutments
(56) arranged at the repository (30) are arranged at the repository portion (50) remote from

the door and in co-operation with the counterabutments (76) at the guide strips (70)
produce an extraction travel for the repository (30) out of the cooling chamber (14),

through which the repository portion (50) remote from the door is displaceable into the
region of the door opening.
Refrigerator according to the claims 2 and 4, characterised in that the repository
(30) comprises a framelike enclosure (53), the portions of which extending parallelly to its

direction of displacement are constructed as struts (54), which on the one hand are
retained to be displaceable in the guide strips (70) and on the other hand - together with a

web (62) facing the door (12) and connecting both the struts (54) and with that longitudinal
side of the repository portion (50) remote from the door, which faces the door (12) - bound

a passage (66), which in the case of positionally correct end position of the repository
portion (30) in the cooling chamber (14) frees at least the opening (19) of a container

inserted into the concavity (17) and is coverable by the repository portion (31) near to the
door.
Refrigerator according to claim 9, characterised in that the struts (54) on their side
facing the passages (66) form guides for the repository portion (31) near to the door, in

which passages this is guided to be displaceable, wherein the displacement travel of the
repository portion (31) near to the door in direction of extraction out of the cooling chamber

(14) is limited by co-operation of the web (62) serving as abutment with an arm (37), which
serves as counterabutment, is arranged at the repository portion (31) near to the door and

which by engaging below the struts (54) supports this the repository portion (31) against
tilting in the extracted position.
Refrigerator according to the claims 2 and 4, characterised in that the repository
portion (50) remote from the door and guided to be displaceable into the guides of the

guide strips (70) is retained in its intended position during the extraction process of the
repository portion (31) near to the door by cams (79), which are arranged at the guides

strips (70), obstruct the extraction movement of the repository portion (50) remote from the 
door and co-o
perate with a ramp (58), wherein the obstruction is removed for the removal
of the repository portion (50) remote from the door from the guide strips (70) by tilting

thereof.
Refrigerator according to claims 2 and 9, characterised in that the web (62) of the
repository portion (50) remote from the door at its end face facing the door (12) as well as

also the longitudinal side, which faces the door (12) and serves as transverse strut (39), of
the repository portion (31) near to the door are provided with a handle (40, 64), which

permits the engagement of fingers of a hand, wherein the handle (40) arranged at the
transverse strut (39) of the portion (31) near to the door at the same time also permits the

access to the handle (64) at the web (62).
Refrigerator according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the repository portion
(50) remote from the door is equipped at its longitudinal side facing the rear wall of the

cooling chamber (14) with a side wall (52) raised above the repository surface (51).
Refrigerator according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that guide grooves (63), into
which the lateral longitudinal struts (34) of the repository portion (31) near to the door are

capable of engaging in displaceable manner, are provided at the web (62) of the repository
portion (50) remote from the door.
Refrigerator according to claim 12, characterised in that suspension hooks (41),
which are formed to be open at the rim in the direction of extraction of the repository

portion (50) remote from the door and are capable of engaging into recesses (65)
arranged at the web (62) thereof, are provided at the transverse strut (39) of the repository

portion (31) near to the door in the proximity of the handle (40) thereof.
