<ABSTRACT>
A charging apparatus includes a magnetic piece 
(14)attached to a wheel (12) of a vehicle (11) for 

rotation together with the wheel, and a battery 
powered device (16) for detecting rotation of the 

magnetic piece. The device includes an induction coil 
(19). As the rotating magnet passes by the coil, an 

electromotive force is induced in the coil by 
electromagnetic induction. The induced electromotive 

force indicates the passing of the magnet and is used 
for computing the speed or travelled distance of the 

vehicle. The same electromotive force is also used 
for charging a storage battery (24). This arrangement 

eliminates the need of replacing the battery and 
preserves the operation of the battery-powered device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for 
detecting and displaying a running condition of a 
vehicle by detecting rotation of a magnetic piece 
attached to a wheel of the vehicle. More particularly 
the invention pertains to such an apparatus capable of 
charging a storage battery by the magnetic piece 
rotation. Wheeled vehicles running on a road or rails 
include a bicycle, automoble, electric car or train 
etc. Computer-based running condition detecting 
apparatus are known which detect or compute a running 
condition of the vehicle (e.g., vehicle speed, 
travelled distance). Particularly, when applied to 
the bicycle, such a running condition detecting 
apparatus is called "cycle computer." For example, in the cycle computer, a magnet is 
mounted on one of spokes of a front wheel while a 
magnetic detector is fixed to a fork blade to detect 
passing of the magnet. In the prior art, a reed switch has been used as 
the magnetic detector. The reed switch is normally 
kept in an OFF condition. When the magnet passes by 
the reed switch as the wheel rotates, the reed switch 
is turned ON. Thus it generates a magnet detection 
signal (reed switch signal) every one revolution of 
the wheel. The number of revolutions of the wheel per 
unit time is measured from the detection signal. The 
cycle computer CPU computes a travelled distance 
and/or a speed of the bicycle by multiplying the 
detected number of revolutions of the wheel by wheel 
circumference data previously stored. A display 
device such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD) 
displays the computed results.  Further, a primary battery (e.g., dry cells) has 
been used as a power source for the prior art cycle 
computer. In this manner, the prior art running condition 
detecting apparatus or cycle computer detects the 
number of revolutions of the wheel, and computes and 
displays the travelled distance and/or speed of the 
vehicle therefrom. Since it employs the primary battery as the power 
source the prior art cycle computer has the problem of 
the battery power consumption. Once the battery power 
has been comsumed, no further running condition can be 
detected. To avoid this, it is necessary for the user to 
replace the battery to a new one before its power is 
used up. The user must regularly check the condition 
of the battery. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a charging apparatus capable of detecting the running 
condition of a vehicle without the need of relacing 
the battery. In accordance with the present
