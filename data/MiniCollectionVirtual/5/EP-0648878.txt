<ABSTRACT>
The thermal-bonded interlining material of the invention comprises at least one non-woven layer (4) of tangled fibres (2) or filaments which has a given general direction and one face of which is covered with spots of heat-meltable polymer. Moreover, it comprises so-called weft threads (3) which are continuous textured filament threads arranged transversely to the abovementioned general direction and linked to the said layer as a result of the tangling of the fibres or filaments of the layer. Since the interlining material comprises only a single non-woven layer, the spots of heat-meltable polymer are arranged on the face of the layer on which weft threads are partially visible. Since the interlining material comprises two non-woven layers (4, 23) of tangled fibres or filaments (2), between which the weft threads (3) are sandwiched, the number of spots of polymer is of the order of or greater than 60 per square centimetre.

Thermobinding interlining, comprising at least one non-woven layer (4) of
intermingled fibers (2) or filaments, of given general direction and of which one

face is coated with dots of thermofusible polymer, characterised in that it
comprises yarns called weft yarns (3) which are yarns of textured continuous

filaments, disposed crosswise to said general direction and bonded to said layer as
a result of the intermingling of the fibers or filaments of the layer.
Interlining according to claim 1, characterised in that the weft yams are
high voluminosity weft yarns, obtained by the air jet texturing technique, from at

least two multifilament yarns, a first yarn called core spun yarn and a second yarn
called effect yarn, the overfeeding of the effect yarn being definitely greater than

that of the core spun yarn.
Interlining according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that it
comprises only one non-woven layer, the weft yarns being partly exposed on a

given face of said layer and in that the dots of thermofusible polymer are placed on
said face.
Interlining according to claim 3, characterised in that the density of the
weft yarns (3) is of at least 3 yarns per cm.
Interlining according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that it

comprises two non-woven layers (5, 23) of intermingled fibers or filaments (2)
between which layers are sandwiched the weft yarns (3), and in that the number of

dots of polymer is equal to or higher than 60 per cm
2
.
Method for the production of a thermobonding interlining whereby dots of
thermofusible polymer are deposited on one face of a non-woven layer (4) of

intermingled fibers or filaments (2), of given general direction, characterised in
that before depositing the dots of polymer, said method consists in :


placing weft yarns (3) made of textured continuous filaments on a conveyor belt
constituted of a wire netting,
covering the weft yarns with a non-woven layer (4) of non-intermingled fibers
or filaments,
subjecting the assembly constituted by the superposition of the weft yams (3)
and of the layer (4) to the action of high pressure jets of water coming from

injectors placed above the netting, so as to intermingle the fibers or filaments (2) of
the layer (4) together and with the weft yarns (3),
subjecting said assembly, which constitutes the base material for interlining, to a
subsequent drying treatment, and in that the dots of thermofusible polymer are 

coated on the face of the base material for interlining which was in contact with
the wire netting.
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that, as the weft yams are
shrinkable textured continuous yarns or filaments, the subsequent treatment is a

thermal treatment capable of causing the shrinking of the weft yarns.
