<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, in which   a) an isonicotinic acid derivative is oxidised to give the corresponding N-oxide, b) if appropriate, this N-oxide is reacted to give isonicotinamide N-oxide, c) isonicotinamide N-oxide is reacted in the presence of an alkylating agent to give a salt of N-alkoxy-isonicotinamide, d) the salt is reacted using an alkali metal cyanide in aqueous solution to give 2-cyanoisonicotinamide, and e) the 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid is obtained in ultrapure form from this product by means of hydrolysis, followed by bringing the pH into the range of 1 to 4.

Process for the production of 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 
characterised in that 


a) isonicotinic acid amide is oxidised to the corresponding N-oxide 
b) isonicotinamide N-oxide is reacted in the presence of an alkylating 
agent to yield the corresponding N-alkoxyisonicotinamide salt, 
c) the salt is converted by an alkali cyanide in an aqueous solution to 
the 2-cyanoisonicotinamide 
d) 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid is obtained at high purity from this 
product by hydrolysis and subsequent pH adjustment to a pH in 

the range from 1 to 4. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that isonicotinic acid 
amide is oxidised to the corresponding N-oxide in the presence of 

hydrogen peroxide in acetic or peracetic acid. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that isonicotinamide 
N-oxide is reacted by means of a dialkyl sulphate, preferably dimethyl 

or diethyl sulphate, at 90 to 105Â° C to yield an N-alkoxyisonicotinamide 
salt. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
N-alkoxyisonicotinamide salt formed is converted by a sodium or 

potassium cyanide to the 2-cyanoisonicotinamide.  
 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that sulphric acid or 
hydrochlorid acid is used for acid hydrolysis of the 2-cyanoisonicotinamide 

and the pH is subsequently adjusted to the range from 1 to 4 with 
ammonia solution. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that sodium or potassium 
hydroxide solution is used for alkaline hydrolysis of the 2-cyanoisonicotinamide 

and the pH is subsequently adjusted to the range from 1 
to 4 with acid. 
2-Cyanoisonicotinamide 
Use of 2-cyanoisonicotinamide as an intermediate for the production of 
2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid.
