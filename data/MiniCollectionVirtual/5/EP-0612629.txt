<ABSTRACT>
Hub for bicycle wheels, composed of a tubular body integral with the frame of the bicycle, in a direction perpendicular to the same frame; of a freely rotating spindle which is mounted coaxially inside the tubular body without the possibility for axial displacement with respect to the latter; of two axisymmetric hollow cores which can be coupled together coaxially and without the possibility of relative rotation; and of a device for fastening the cores together and to the spindle. The outer core is integral with the wheel of the bicycle, in a coaxial position, while the inner core fastens to the abovementioned spindle without the capability of rotating with respect to the latter.

A hub for a bicycle wheel which comprises a tubular body 
(1) indivisibly part of the frame (6) of the bicycle, whose axle 

is perpendicular to that frame (6): and which consists of an 
turning axle (2) mounted in a coaxial position in the tubular 

body (1), capable of turning freely with no possibility of axial 
slipping with respect to that body (1): which is characterized 

by two hollow turning parts (3, 4) which can be coupled coaxially 
together with no possibility of relative rotation, the outer (4) 

being fixed to the bicycle wheel in a coaxial position, while the 
inner part (3) can be fixed to the turning axle (2), without 

being able to turn with respect to it; and by a fixing device 
(17, 21, 23, 24) attaching the hollow turning parts (3, 4) 

together and to the turning axle referred to (2). 
A bicycle having the hub in accordance with claim 1, in 
which the two hollow turning parts (3, 4) are fixed together and 

to the turning axle (2) by the fixing device (17, 21, 23, 24) and 
in which the turning axle (2) is mounted in a coaxial position 

in the tubular body (1) forming part of the bicycle frame (6). 
A bicycle in accordance with claim 2, a characteristic 
of which is that the tubular body (1) projects perpendicularly 

in relation to the bicycle frame (6) towards the opposite side 
to that occupied by the pedal plate. 
A bicycle in accordance with claim 2, a characteristic 
of which is that the turning axle (2) is mounted on the tubular 

body (1) with the aid of bearings which avoid relative axial slip 
between the tubular body (1) and the turning axle (2). 
A bicycle in accordance with claims 2 and 4, a 
characteristic of which is that the turning axle (2) projects 

from the tubular body (1) at least on one side, over an axially 
grooved area (9) on which the inner part (3) is mounted. 
A bicycle in accordance with claims 2 to 4, a 
characteristic of which is that the turning axle (2) projects 

from the tubular body (1) on both sides over the two axially 
grooved areas (9) and (9'), on one of which, that directed (9) 

to the opposite side to that occupied by the driving chain, is 
mounted the inner part (3), while the sprocket wheel or set of 

sprocket wheels (27) of the drive is mounted on the other part 
(9'). 
A bicycle in accordance with claim 2, a characteristic 
of which is that the turning axle (2) is hollow, at least 

partially, and presents, starting from the section of the end 
adjacent to the axially grooved area (9) on which is mounted the 

inner part (3), a coaxial passage (10) which opens to an inner 
area (11) of greater cross-section. 
A hub for bicycle wheels in accordance with claim 1, 
which is characterized by the parts (3) and (4) having a turning 

partition, cylindrical or conical, closed at the smaller end by 
a closure (12) (13); in which the coaxial, cylindrical, axially  

 
grooved (14) partition (12) of the inner part (3) has suitable 

dimensions for mounting, by means of a slip fit, along the length 
of the grooved area (9) which corresponds to the turning axle 

(2), while the partition (13) of the outer part (4) presents a 
coaxial orifice which goes through it; in which the partitions 

(12) (13) of the two parts have, also, on the opposite surfaces, 
pivots (17) and holes (15) which fit together so as to prevent 

any turning of the one relative to the other. 
A hub for bicycle wheels in accordance with claims 1 and 
8, which is characterized by the device fixing the hollow turning 

parts (3, 4) together and to the said turning axle (2) (17, 21, 
23, 24), being made up of a cylindrical cotter pin (17) which is 

fixed to the orifice of the partition (13) of the outer part (4) 
and projects into the interior of this outer part on a piece 

introduced through the above mentioned coaxial passage (10) of 
the turning axle (2), its outer cross-section being approximately 

equal to that of the passage (10) and longer, the cotter pin on 
the wall having, close to the inner end, holes in each of which 

is lodged a ball (18), which projects partially from the surface 
of this wall, so as to be located in the inner area (11) of the 

larger section of the axle (2); the characteristic of these balls 
(18) being their withdrawal and extraction through the actual 

axial displacement of a piston (20) lodged within the cotter pin 
(17). 
A hub for bicycle wheels in accordance with claim 8, 
which is characterized by the wall of the inner part (3) having, 

fixed on its free flange, a circular plate (25) on the edge of 
which the brake parts are mounted (26). 
A hub for bicycle wheels in accordance with claim 8, 
which is characterized by having in the interior of the wall of 

the inner part (3) brake shoes (29) able to be directed towards 
the interior surface of this inner part by means of a mechanism 

(30) which operates the brake.
