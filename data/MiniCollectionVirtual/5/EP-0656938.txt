<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for counting the number of microorganism colonies present on a disposable microorganism culturing device having a substantially planar substrate. The preferred apparatus (10) of the present invention includes an LED bar (20) illuminating the surface of the substrate and a linear array of SELFOC lenses (22) which focus the light reflected off of the substrate onto a linear CCD sensor array (24). The CCD sensor array (24) is connected to a microprocessor (32) which analyzes the raster-scanned data using the preferred algorithm. The preferred algorithm used the sigma-shaped neighborhood for image processing. The preferred algorithm passes the sigma region across the image in a raster-scanned order to detect object starts and merges which yield a colony count for a scanned microorganism culturing device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for counting the 
number of distinct objects in a scanned image. In particular, it relates to a 
method and apparatus for counting the number of microorganism colonies 
present on a substantially planar substrate. Different methods and devices are known for counting 
microorganism colonies in, for example, petri dishes. Manual counting of 
colonies by trained laboratory personnel is well-known. This method has many 
disadvantages. They include the costs associated with the use of skilled 
technicians to perform the time-consuming chore of manual counting as well as 
the limited accuracy in the counts achieved. Automated counting systems are also known. They can be 
separated into two basic categories. The first category includes those systems 
employing cameras or video equipment in conjunction with hard-wired circuits 
or digital computers to count the number of colonies in a petri dish. Examples 
of such systems are described in EP Publication No. 0 301 600; U.S. Patent 
No. 3,811,036 to Perry; and French Publication No. 2 602 074. Video-based systems suffer from a number of disadvantages. 
The primary disadvantage is the expensive and sophisticated equipment used in 
such systems to process the raw pixel image produced by the video cameras. 
To avoid multiple counting of the same colonies such systems typically include 
processing-intensive labelling schemes requiring relatively powerful computer 
systems to accurately count of the number of colonies in an acceptable amount 
of time. An additional disadvantage is that many of these video-based 
systems require that the petri dishes be illuminated through their bottom surface 
which requires a substrate which is light permeable to ensure accurate counting. 
The illumination is typically required because of the thickness of the agar used 
in petri dishes results in colonies growing on the surface of the agar as well as 
in the middle and on the bottom of the agar. Surface illumination only would 
result in undercounting of the colonies in the middle and on the bottom of the 
agar. In other systems, such as that described in EP 0 301 600, the absorbance 
and transmission of light is used to detect colonies.  
 The growth of colonies throughout the vertical thickness of the 
medium is not a particular problem for users of the disposable microorganism 
culturing devices such as PETRIFILM culture plates, manufactured by 3M 
Company. Such devices have a very thin layer of growth medium making all 
colonies
