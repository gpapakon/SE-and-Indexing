<ABSTRACT>
An image forming device having a rotating drum around 
which an image forming material is trained, an ink sheet 

conveying mechanism which conveys an ink sheet synchronously 
with rotation of the rotating drum, an ink transfer device 

which fits the image forming material and the ink sheet 
together and effects either heating or pressing such that 

ink is transferred onto the image forming material, and a 
fitting/conveying device which moves an image receiving 

material with respect to a peripheral surface of the 
rotating drum synchronously with the rotation of the 

rotating drum and which fits the image forming material and 
the image receiving material together and applies either a 

predetermined pressure or a predetermined temperature so 
that ink is transferred from the image forming material to 

the image receiving material; and an image forming method 
including above-described processes. Exposure need be 

effected only once for each color, and the image forming 
materials can be used repeatedly. Therefore, a plurality of 

color proofs can be prepared from a single original plate, 
and time involved in preparing the color proofs can be 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
device and method in which, after inks corresponding to 
respective colors have been transferred onto an image 
forming material, a color image corresponding to a print 
original image is formed on an image receiving material by 
the inks of the respective colors being successively 
transferred onto the image receiving material. At a printer, when color printing a large amount of 
printed matter in which it is necessary to check the color 
in particular, e.g., calendars, picture books, photograph 
books, color advertisements included in newspapers (so-called 
"inserted bills") and the like, an advance check is 
performed by using color proofs (proofing) before the actual 
printing is effected at the printer. In order to print several color proofs during proofing, 
photosensitive materials are used which are cheaper than and 
less printable than a photosensitive lithographic printing 
plate (PS plate) used in actual printing. The printed matter finished by proofing is distributed 
to respective persons for checking. After various checks  
 
have been performed, the original is corrected. However, in conventional proofing devices, there is a 
dispersion in the quality of the printed matter obtained 
when several color proofs are printed. Therefore, before 
the color proofs are distributed to the respective persons 
for checking, color proofs having matching quality must be 
selected. Further, because printing of the color proofs is 
carried out by using the ink used during actual printing, 
the operators' hands become dirty, maintenance of the device 
is complex, and workability is insufficient. In recent years, a method of preparing color proofs has 
been used in which a photosensitive material, in which a 
pigment is included in advance, and a color separated print 
original corresponding to the pigment are exposed and 
developed while in a superposed state. Photosensitive 
materials on which the color separated images of the 
respective colors are recorded are thereby obtained. These 
color separated images are successively transferred to a 
single image receiving film. Next, the color proofs are 
prepared by the image forming device ("Color Art" [trade 
name] manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) which 
carries out the actual transfer onto the printing paper 
(actual paper). In accordance with such an image forming device, 
because ink is not used, there are no operational drawbacks,  
 
such as the operators' hands being dirtied or the like, and
