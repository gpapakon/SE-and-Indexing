Method for authentication between two electronic
devices, comprising the steps:


a) generation of at least two random numbers,
b) transmission of the two random numbers, so that both
are available both in the first station and in the

second station,
c) encryption of the random numbers in both stations to
form in each case one cryptogram associated with

each random number,

characterized by the further steps:

d) transmission of a part of the first cryptogram from
one station to the other station,
e) comparison of the cryptogram part in the other
station with the corresponding cryptogram part

calculated there and, if they do not correspond,
termination of further output of the cryptogram,
f) transmission of a part of the second cryptogram from
the other station,
g) comparison of the cryptogram part transmitted from
the other station in one station with the

corresponding cryptogram part calculated here, and
termination of further output of the cryptogram if

they do not correspond,
h) repetition of steps d) to g) with the other parts of
the cryptogram until complete correspondence is

obtained or termination has taken place.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that one random number is produced in one station and is

transmitted to the other station, and the other random 
number is produced in the other station and is sent to

the first station.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that, if the authentication process is terminated

internally, both stations output random number sequences
further outwards so that the termination point in the bit

stream cannot be detected externally.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that one station is a portable data

medium, in particular a chip card, and the other station
is a read-write station.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the portable data medium has an

error counter, and in that the card is locked at a
predetermined number of errors.
