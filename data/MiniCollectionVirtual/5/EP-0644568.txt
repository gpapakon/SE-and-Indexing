<ABSTRACT>
A safety switch inserted in an electric circuit of a 
vehicle, the switch comprising: 


a housing (1, 1') fixed to the vehicle; 
a spherical inertia mass (22) movable from a first 
unstable position of normal operation, whereby the 

spherical mass (22) allows current passage in said 
circuit, to a second stable position (22a) whereby the 

current in the circuit is interrupted responsive to 
sharp acceleration or deceleration in a horizontal 

plane; 
a first electric contact (11) for opening or 
closing on a second electric contact (12) responsive to 

the position of the spherical mass (22); 
resetting means (35, 46) for taking the spherical 
inertia mass (22) from said second position (22a) to 

said first position. 
 
In its first position the spherical inertia mass (22) is 

interposed between a concave retaining seat (26, 44) and 
a convex retaining means (29, 54) that retain the mass 

in opposite ways along a substantially vertical axis (a) 
by means of a spring (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safety switch of 
the normally closed kind for vehicle engines, and more 
particularly pertains to a safety switch inserted in the 
fuel pump electric circuit. The function of the switch is 
to open responsive to acceleration or deceleration 
exceeding a predetermined intensity to which the vehicle is 
subjected in a horizontal plane. At the same time, the switch must not be responsive to 
jerks or vibration of normal intensity. Switches of this kind are well known, for example 
those disclosed in US-A-2206067 and EP-A-0038328. These 
devices have a drawback in that they are rather complex and 
costly from a constructional point of view. 
Some of them are also rather difficult to reset in their 
original position after they have been activated. FR-A-2 620 855 discloses a safety switch inserted in 
an electric circuit of a vehicle. The switch comprises: 
a housing fixed to the vehicle;  a spherical inertia mass movable from a first unstable 
position of normal operation, whereby the spherical mass 
allows current passage in said circuit, to a second stable 
position whereby current in the circuit is interrupted 
responsive to sharp acceleration or deceleration in a 
horizontal plane; a first electric contact for opening or closing on a 
second electric contact responsive to the position of the 
spherical mass. In said first position the spherical 
inertia mass is interposed between a concave retaining seat  
 
and a convex retaining means. The mass is retained by said 
seat and said means in opposite ways along a substantially 
vertical axis by means of gravity of a mass. From other patent publications (CH-A-351011, FR-A-2151585, 
DE-A-3128594, CH-A-486345) it is known to retain 
the inertia mass by resilient biasing means. None of the above cited references provide a safety 
switch wherein resetting operation is possible also when 
the vehicle is considerably slanting after a crash. In such 
a condition, the prior art resetting means are not capable 
of taking the spherical inertia mass from the second, open 
circuit position back to the first, current conductive 
position. The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
safety switch capable of overcoming the above problem. According to this invention, there is provided a 
safety switch as specified in claim 1. Preferred but not-limiting embodiments of the switch 
according to the invention are described hereinafter with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

A safety switch inserted in an electric circuit 
of a vehicle, the switch comprising: 


a housing (1) fixed to the vehicle; 
a spherical inertia mass (22) movable from a first 
unstable position of normal operation, whereby the 

spherical mass (22) allows current passage in said circuit, 
to a second stable position (22a) whereby the current in 

the circuit is interrupted responsive to sharp acceleration 
or deceleration in a horizontal plane; 
a first electric contact (11) for opening or closing 
on a second electric contact (12) responsive to the 

position of the spherical mass (22); 
resetting means (35, 46) for taking the spherical 
inertia mass (22) from said second position (22a) to said 

first position; 
in said first position the spherical inertia mass (22) 
being interposed between a concave retaining seat (44) and 

a convex retaining means (54), the mass being retained by 
said concave seat (44) and said convex means (54) in 

opposite ways along a substantially vertical axis (a); 
characterised in that the mass being retained by means of resilient biasing means (30) and said resetting means (46) comprises 

an upper push-button provided with a plurality of 
appendixes (48) having lower outwardly diverging inclined 

surfaces (49) capable of engaging said mass in said second 
position (22a). 
A safety switch as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that there are provided at least three of 

said appendixes (48) having lower outwardly diverging 
inclined surfaces (49).  

 
A safety switch as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that said convex retaining means is a 

member (54) floating in the direction of said axis (a), 
said floating member (54) being interposed between the 

spherical mass (22) and said first contact (11) in form of 
an elastic lamina, said lamina being in turn interposed 

between said the spherical mass (22) and resilient biasing 
means (30) co-operating for retaining said mass (22) 

between said concave seat (44) and said convex means (54) 
along said axis (a). 
A safety switch as claimed in claim 3,
 
characterized in that said floating member (54) comprises: 


an upper narrow shaft end portion (54a) normally 
engaging said mass (22), 
a lower downwardly open larger portion (54b) engaged 
by said resilient biasing means (30), said larger portion 

(54b) being capable of engaging said first contact (11) for 
opening said second electric contact (12) responsive to 

movement of the spherical mass (22). 
A safety switch as claimed in claim 4,
 
characterized in that said narrow shaft end portion (54a) 

is inserted in a corresponding bore obtained in said first 
contact (11).
