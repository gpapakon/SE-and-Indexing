<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting uterine fibrosis 
comprising administering to a human or other mammal in 

need of treatment an effective amount of a compound 
having the formula 


Wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


or 

wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   wherein R² is selected from the group consisting 

of pyrrolidino and piperidino, a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt or solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Uterine fibrosis is an old and ever present
clinical problem which goes under a variety of names,
including uterine hypertrophy, uterine lieomyomata,
myometrial hypertrophy, fibrosis uteri, and fibrotic
metritis. Essentially, uterine fibrosis is a condition
where there is an inappropriate deposition of fibroid
tissue on the wall of the uterus.This condition is a cause of dysmenorrhea and
infertility in women. The exact cause of this condition is
poorly understood but evidence suggests that it is an
inappropriate response of fibroid tissue to estrogen. Such
a condition has been produced in rabbits by daily
administrations of estrogen for 3 months. In guinea pigs,
the condition has been produced by daily administration of
estrogen for four months. Further, in rats, estrogen
causes similar hypertrophy.The most common treatment of uterine fibrosis
involves surgical procedures both costly and sometimes a
source of complications such as the formation of abdominal
adhesions and infections. In some patients, initial
surgery is only a temporary treatment and the fibroids
regrow. In those cases a hysterectomy is performed which
effectively ends the fibroids but also the reproductive
life of the patient. Also, gonadotropin releasing hormone
antagonists may be administered, yet their use is tempered
by the fact they can lead to osteoporosis.This invention provides the use of a compound of
formula I in the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting
the inappropriate deposition of fibroid tissue on the wall
of the uterus: 

   Wherein R1 and R3 are independently hydrogen,
-CH3,

or

wherein Ar is
optionally substituted phenyl;
   R2 is selected from the group consisting of
pyrrolidino and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts and solvates thereof.The current invention concerns the discovery that
a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes
(benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for
inhibiting uterine fibrosis, where there is an inappropriate
deposition of fibroid tissue on the wall of the uterus. The
use provided by this invention facilitates administration to
a human in need of inhibition of uterine fibrosis, a dose of
a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt or solvate thereof, that is effective to inhibit
uterine fibrosis. The term inhibit is defined to include its
generally accepted meaning which includes prophylactically
treating a human subject to incurring uterine fibrosis, and
holding in check and/or treating existing uterine fibrosis.Generally, the compound is
