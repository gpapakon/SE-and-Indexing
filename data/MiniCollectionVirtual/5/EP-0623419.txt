<ABSTRACT>
A simple and efficient tool exchanger device is presented. 
The device has a pair of swing arms (8, 9), and each swing arm 

is provided with a set of grippers (11, 12) for holding a tool 
bit. The positions of the swing arms (8, 9) are separated by 90 

degree so that they will not interfere with each other during 
the swinging motion. One driving device (2) is provided to 

operate both swing arms (8, 9) and operate the gripper devices 
(11, 12). The swing arm (8) rotates upwards to remove a used 

tool bit (10) from the machining shaft (21) of a machining 
center and the other swing arm (9) is rotated downwards to 

install a new tool bit (10') in the vacated machining shaft in a 
single simultaneous step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
automatically exchanging tools between a main machining
axis and a tool magazine.Productivity improvement is one of the basic requirements
of a machining centre. With an improvement in cutting
efficiency being achieved in modern machining centres,
there is a strong need for shortening the non-cutting
time particularly for light alloy fabrication operations
which generally require short cutting time. There is
thus an important need for shortening the time required
for exchanging the tools between machining steps, because
such steps occupy almost 20 percent of the total
machining cycle time. To date, various tool exchanger
devices have been disclosed, for example, in JP-A-5016047,
JP-B-61053182 and JP-U-61042755.Such a device typically performs the following steps:
gripping a tool, a used tool which has completed its job,
disposed in the spindle of the machine centre, removing
the used tool from the tapered hole of the spindle
exchanging the position of the used tool disposed on a
line of the extension of the spindle with another tool to
be used in the same position, inserting this tool in the
tapered hole of the spindle and releasing the hold on the
spindle so that it can rotate and move into an operating
position. However, such a device tries to improve the 
machining efficiency by speeding up the steps by using
hydraulic or mechanical transmission systems.The conventional device of this type suffered from the
following problems.
a) There is a large motion range (the path of travel
made by the tools to be exchanged), and the improvement
is limited basically by the acceleration achievable
within the speed attained by the tool.b) For each motion of the steps, acceleration and
deceleration periods are required, and a time lag is
generated.c) Various mechanisms are required for performing the
various steps, and the device becomes complex to make,
thus increasing the chances of device breakdowns.It is known from US-A-4575918 to provide an automatic
tool exchanger comprising a support frame, a driving
bevel gear, freely rotatably supported on said support
frame, a driving means having an output shaft engaged to
said driving bevel gear for rotating said driving bevel
gear, a pair of follower bevel gears disposed on both
sides of said driving bevel gear and engaged therewith,
a pair of rotating shafts freely rotatably disposed on
said support frame on both sides of said output shaft, a 
pair of swing arms each having a gripper device disposed
on one end thereof, the
