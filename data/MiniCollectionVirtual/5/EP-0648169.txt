<CLAIMS>
Method of operating a traction control system in 
which, when a predetermined slip threshold is exceeded by 

the tractive slip of at least one driven wheel, the wheel 
is braked and/or the driving torque of the engine is 

reduced, and in which the driven wheels are monitored for 
differences in the diameters of the tyres and a switching 

signal is generated when an impermissible difference is 
detected, characterized in that the switching signal 

raises the predetermined slip threshold. 
Method according to Claim 1, in which the predetermined 
slip threshold is lowered during control, starting 

from a high slip threshold, characterized in that the 
switching signal sets the slip threshold to the high slip 

threshold or holds it there. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the monitoring for an impermissible difference is 

performed in periods without braking, at a low engine 
torque, in the absence of cornering and in the absence of 

control of the brake pressure and/or the engine torque. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that an impermissible difference is detected if 

the mean speed of the driven wheels differs by at least 
a predetermined value and for a predetermined time from 

the mean speed of the non-driven wheels. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that an impermissible difference is detected if 

the magnitude of the difference between the speeds of the 
driven wheels is larger than a percentage of the mean 

wheel speed of the non-driven wheels and either the  
 

difference between the speed of the driven rear wheel on 
one side of the vehicle and that of the driven rear wheel 

on the other side of the vehicle is greater than 0 and 
the difference between the speed of the non-driven wheel 

on the other side of the vehicle and that of the driven 
wheel on the other side of the vehicle is smaller than a 

percentage of the mean speed of the non-driven vehicle 
wheels or the difference between the speed of the driven 

rear wheel on one side of the vehicle and that of the 
driven rear wheel is smaller than or equal to 0 and the 

difference between the speed of the non-driven wheel on 
one side of the vehicle and that of the driven wheel on 

one side of the vehicle is smaller than a percentage of 
the mean speed of the non-driven wheels. 
Method according to either of Claims 4 or 5, characterized 
in that a counter is provided which is incremented, 

starting from an initial value, when the 
predetermined difference is exceeded and otherwise is 

decremented and, after reaching a predetermined count, 
produces the switching signal. 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the switching signal after the predetermined count is 

reached is maintained until the initial value is reached 
by a subsequent decrementation.
