<ABSTRACT>
In a thruster based on the catalytic and/or thermal decomposition of a liquid energy carrier (61), especially hydrazine, there is, in the injection-side end region (1) of a decomposition chamber (3) filled with a catalyst bed (2), at least one layer of a sieve (13-15) which fills the cross-sectional area of the decomposition chamber (3) and which is movable in the direction of the catalyst bed (2). The sieve (13) or sieve bundle (13-15) is loaded from the injection side (1) by a mechanical pressure stress which is generated either by a concertina (9), through which the liquid energy carrier flows, or by one or more compression springs (29,58,59,60).

<CLAIMS>
Thruster based on the catalytic and/or thermal 
decomposition of a liquid energy carrier, in particular 

hydrazine, wherein the liquid energy carrier is 
delivered from a storage tank via at least one 

injection pipe (5, 25) and an injection head (11, 31) 
into a decomposition chamber (3, 23) filled with a 

catalyst bed (2, 22) and wherein disposed between the 
injection head (11, 31) and the catalyst bed (2, 22) is 

at least one screen (13-15, 33-35), which is applied by 
its full surface against the catalyst bed (2, 22) and 

is pressure-loaded in the direction of said catalyst 
bed, characterized in that the screen (13-15) as well 

as the injection head (11) are mounted so as to be 
movable in the direction of the catalyst bed (2) and 

that disposed between the injection pipe (5) and the 
injection head (11) is an undulating diaphragm (9), 

through which the liquid energy carrier may flow. 
Thruster according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the injection head (11) completely fills the cross-sectional 

area of the decomposition chamber (3).
