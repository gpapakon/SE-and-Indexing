<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mass-flow conveyor, from which falling shafts branch off in order to supply packaging machines with cigarettes. The object is to shut off the cigarette-filled falling shafts, relative to the mass flow passing through, during the standstill of the packaging machines in a way which treats the articles carefully. This is achieved by means of a blade (19), around which is guided a flexible band (17) which, on the one hand, is fastened in the region of the shaft inlet to a limiting wall (11) of the falling shaft (6), the said limiting wall being located in the feed side of the mass flow (3), and, on the other hand, is held behind the limiting wall (11) by a tension spring (22). The blade (19) can be moved obliquely upwards out of the limiting wall (11) to an opposite limiting wall (12). Located opposite the shaft inlet is a breathing compensating volume (32) of the mass flow (3), and a band roller (13) is arranged at the shaft inlet adjacently to the opposite limiting wall (12). This arrangement guarantees a smooth displacement of the articles during the shutting-off advance of the blade, during which the band continuously lifts the articles which are received by the compensating volume.

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor arrangement for transferring rod-shaped articles
of the tobacco-processing industry from a manufacturing machine

to at least one device for further processing, having a conveyor
belt (2) which supplies the articles substantially horizontally

transversely to their axis in a stacked formation, and at least
one conveyor belt (6) which forms a T-shaped branch with the

conveyor belt, guides the articles substantially vertically
downwards, is constructed as a drop shaft and may be blocked with

respect to the supplying conveyor belt in the region of the T-shaped
branch by a separating means (20) penetrating the flow of

articles transversely to their axis between opposing delimiting
walls (11, 12) of the drop shaft substantially in the supply

direction (arrow 4) of the mass flow of articles (3),
characterized in that the separating means (20) may be moved

obliquely upwards towards the opposing drop-shaft entry edge by
means of a vertical component.
A conveyor arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the separating means (20) has a belt (17) which is fixed

to the drop-shaft entry of the delimiting wall (11) on the supply
side, is guided about the leading edge (18) of an arm (19) which

may be withdrawn from the delimiting wall (11) below the drop-shaft
entry and is held at its free end by a resilient tension

connection (22).
A conveyor arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a conveyor drum (13) which may be driven

in the supply direction (arrow 4) of the mass flow of articles
(3) is arranged at the drop-shaft entry edge of the opposing

delimiting wall (12).
A conveyor arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that opposite the drop-shaft entry, which may

be blocked by the separating means (20), there is a ventilated
compensating volume (32) of the supplying conveyor belt (2). 
A conveyor arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the compensating volume (32) comprises two flaps (36,

37) which may be deflected about inner pivot axes (33, 34) and
whereof the free ends are connected by way of a flexible cover

(38) lying on the flow of articles (3).
A conveyor arrangement according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that the arm (19) is arranged on a pneumatically

actuated carriage (23) which is equipped with a linear guide
means (24).
