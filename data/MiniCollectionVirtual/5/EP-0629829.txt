<ABSTRACT>
This plant, of modular design which is easy to transport and to assemble on the site, comprises: an air compressor unit (1); two bottles (tanks) (2A, 2B) for purification of air by adsorption; an air distillation column (5); one or two frameworks (13, 31) in which all the other elements of the plant are mounted: heat exchangers (24, 25), cold accessories (26, 27), hot accessories (14, 17, 18, 19), all the connecting pipes and all the monitoring, control and instrumentation elements (21, 28); and conduits (6) for connection between the various parts of the plant. Application to double-column air distillation plants.

<CLAIMS>
Air distillation installation, comprising 

(A) an air compressor unit (1) the output of which 
is connected to an outlet connection (11); 
(B) two bottles (2A, 2B) for purifying air by 
adsorption having inlet/outlet connections (12A, 12B); 
(C) a first frame (13) in which are mounted: (a) the 
accessories downstream of the compressor such as an air-precooling 

assembly (14, 17); (b) the purifying bottle 
accessories, such as an assembly of valves and a 

regeneration gas pre-heater (18); and (c) the connecting 
pipes for the above-mentioned accessories, with their 

safety devices and their automatic and/or remote-controlled 
valves, these pipes optionally terminating in connections 

(15, 22A, 22B, 23) for connection to other sections (1, 2A, 

2B, 4) of the installation, and the corresponding control, 
operating and instrumentation devices (21); 
(D) a second frame (31) in which are mounted; (d) 
the principal heat exchangers (24) and the sub-coolers 

(25); (e) the set of cold accessories such as the cryogenic 
valves and optionally the cryogenic pumps (26) and the 

expansion turbines (27); and (f) the connecting pipes for 
the elements mounted in the second frame, with their safety 

devices and their automatic and/or remote-controlled 
valves, these pipes optionally terminating in connections 

(29, 30) for connection to other sections (3, 5) of the 
installation, and the corresponding operating, control and 

instrumentation devices (28), the cold sections being 
thermally insulated; 
(E) an air distillation column (5) equipped with a 
specific number of connections (33) for the fluid inlets 

and outlets; and 
(F) connecting pipes (6) between the associated 
connections (11-15, 12A-22A, 12B-22B, 23-29, 

30-33) of the sections (A) to (E) of the installation, it 
being possible for the air compressor unit to be mounted in  

 
the first frame, and for the purification bottles to be 

mounted in at least one of the frames, the air distillation 
column being situated outside the frames. 
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in 
that each frame (13, 31) groups together all the operating, 

control and instrumentation devices (21, 28) in one lateral 
housing located at its lower section, the two housings 

facing one another and including a workstation (35) for one 
operator. 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the pipework (19) for discharging the 

residual gas from the column (5) to the air is mounted (31) 
in at least one (13) of the two frames (13, 31). 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that all the connecting pipes (6) are 

rectilinear. 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the column (5) is insulated under 

vacuum. 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the column (5) is a double air 

distillation column comprising a medium pressure column on 
top of which is a low-pressure column.
