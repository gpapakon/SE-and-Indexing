<ABSTRACT>
An improved induction furnace is described which is capable to continuously and homogeneously heat a flat product of steel industry, particularly a thin slab from a continouous casting plant, upstream of the final rolling steps during the manufacture of thin steel strips. Owing to the small thickness shown by the product to be heated a furnace of this type will have a reduced size of coils in the strip feeding direction. To avoid that under these conditions the efficiency may decrease and a great leakage flux may be established, with consequent serious drawbacks, the present invention provides for a flux concentrator formed of two continuous packets of lamination having a substantially C-shaped cross section wrapping the inductor coil both at the upper and lower side along the whole length thereof while leaving free only the passage area through which the product to be heated enters the coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
induction furnace for heating or re-heating flat 
products of steel industry, particularly to 
re-establish a homogeneous temperature, suitable to 
rolling thin steel slabs. It is known from the Italian patent application 
No. 20534 A/89, corresponding to the International 
publication WO 90/14742, an induction furnace 
comprising an array of coils, which are separately fed 
by one or more frequency converters and crossed in 
succession by the strip being supported and caused to 
move forward by pairs of rollers between each coil and 
the subsequent one, wherein flux concentrator devices 
are provided, mounted in pairs at the ends of each 
inductor, at least on an upper or lower side, with 
respect to the plane defined by the strip itself. Although this solution gives best results, as it 
allows for the first time to exploit satisfactorily 
the induction heating in connection with longitudinal 
flat products, whereas the magnetic flux was 
previously mainly directed such as to cross 
transversely the strip in the thickness direction, 
with poor results but for the thermal treatment of the 
edges only, however some inconveniences have been 
experienced, mainly due to the great leakage of 
magnetic flux which, as it closes at the outside of  
 
the strip, crosses the structural metal parts of the 
apparatus, thus causing an undue heating thereof in 
spite of the presence of lateral flux concentrators, 
even if movable. Previously, with longer inductors (along the 
longitudinal size of the product to be heated), as it 
was possible for thicker products, the utilization of 
concentrators would have been useless, since the little 
improvement in the efficiency and reduction of leakage 
would not be worth in comparison with the increase of 
costs. EP-A-0243340 discloses an induction furnace 
with flux concentrators extending along the whole 
width of the coil for equalizing the temperature in 
steel slabs of usual thickness, in order to solve the 
problems of "rail shadows" due to the slab previously 
passing on the rails of a re-heating furnace, where 
the contact therewith and the consequent lower temperature 
gives rise to the formation of differently 
coloured stripes. Induction heating is carried out 
with the slab stationary and at given position. According 
to this prior specification only one outer yoke 
would have been provided to be sufficient, being associate 
to the lower side of the coil. On the other hand with a short inductor, as 
necessarily

<CLAIMS>
An induction furnace for heating, at homogeneous 
temperature, flat products (1) such as thin 

slabs having a thickness of 30 mm or less or steel 
strips continuously crossing said furnace, comprising 

in succession inductor coils (2), each of which is 
embedded in an inductor assembly with refractory material 

(3) and is separately fed through frequency 
converters, there being provided pairs of rollers (8) 

between each coil and the subsequent one, for supporting 
and feeding forward the flat product (1), wherein 

the size of each coil (2) in the feeding direction of 
the strip is 350 mm or less, characterized in that 

each coil (2) is enclosed in a linear flux concentrator 
(5) extending along the whole width of the coil 

(2) in the crosswise direction with respect to the 
feeding direction of said flat product (1) and formed of two portions 

(5a, 5b), respectively upper and lower portion, being 
joined at their ends while leaving centrally free a 

gap (6) for said flat product (1) passing therethrough. 
An induction furnace according to claim 1, 
characterized in that each portion (5a, 5b) of the 

linear concentrator (5) is formed as a packet of magnetic 
sheet irons (7) arranged side by side, which are 

substantially C-shaped and all directed at right angles 
to both the plane of coil (2) and the one defined by 

the product (1) to be heated, arranged in facing relationship 
to each other for housing in said gap (6) 

comprised therebetwenn said coil (2) which in turn 
surrounds the flat product (1).
