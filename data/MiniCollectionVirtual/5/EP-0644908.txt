<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a silicon based
lacquer as a substrate coating, and the thus-obtained
substrates.Hitherto, studies and efforts have been made to obtain
lacquers endowed with improved technical properties, to be
used as coatings for substrates which are typically used in
extremely harsh environments. Examples of coatings which allow
the coated substrates to be used in said harsh environment are
coatings with properties such as: anti-contamination, antiscratch,
heat-resistance and refractory properties, low moisture
permeability, resistance to chemicals, insulation properties,
oxygen-barrier, high bulk resistivity, low friction
coefficient, high adhesion on the substrates.The fields wherein said coatings may be used are various
and numerous. One can cite, as illustrative, those fields
wherein the coatings are protecting for active and passive
electric, electronic, optical components and assemblies thereof
against environmental stresses.During the past years, research in the field of microelectronics
has been directed to higher productivity and devices
miniaturisation. Thus, the use of surface-mounted devices
(SMD), rendering high-speed component placement possible,
has lead to significant gain in productivity, the soldering
of such surface mounted devices (SMD) on the printed
circuits now being carried out on the face(s) of the circuit
where the devices are lodged. The two soldering processes currently
used are wave soldering and reflow soldering. The first
of these two processes, the so-called wave soldering process, 
comprises the step of bringing the printed circuit bearing the
SMDs adhered thereon into contact with a stationary wave within
a flowing molten solder bath, the parameters of temperature
and time being respectively about 260°C and about 10 s.
The second process, so-called reflow soldering comprises the
step of applying solder in the solid state at the contact pins
of the SMD adhered on the printed circuit board followed by
heating, using IR radiation or vapor phase transfer, of the
foregoing assembly at a temperature of about 220°C for a period
of time of about 30 s. The component and the substrate
are thus submitted to somewhat drastic thermal conditions, but
they must of course retain their properties, especially electronic
properties, i.e. the shift due to the thermal treatment
should be less than a few percent, typically less than 3%.Concurrently, efforts have been directed to miniaturise
the components themselves and new components such as new capacitors,
