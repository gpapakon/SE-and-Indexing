<DESCRIPTION>
Flunixin, known as 2-[[2-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]amino]-3-pyridinecarboxylic 
acid, is a potent analgesic, particularly well suited 
for parenteral administration. The compound 2-methyl-3-trifluoromethylaniline 
(MTA) is a valuable intermediate for preparing 
flunixin, but is difficult to prepare due to the unique positioning of three 
different substituents in the 1-,2- and 3- positions on the benzene ring. 
Heinz W. Gschwend and Walton Fuhrer, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 44, (1979), 
pp. 1133-1136 teach the specific ortho substitution of N-pivaloylanilines 
via the dilithio species with n-butyl lithium. J.M. Muchowski and M. 
Venuti, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 45, pp. 4798-4801 teach the ortho 
functionalization of N-t-butoxycarbonyl derivatives with tert-butyllithium 
and suggest that this group is more easily removed than the N-pivaloyl 
group. UK Patent Application 2194533 describes the preparation of 2-amino-6-trifluoromethyltoluene 
(i.e. 2-methyl-3-trifluoromethylaniline) 
from dichlorotrifluoromethyltoluene. It would be desirable to provide a 
process for preparing flunixin and its intermediate, MTA, in as few or 
even fewer steps than other processes previously taught. It would be 
desirable to provide novel intermediates which allow easy and 
convenient methylation ortho to nitrogen with little or no formation of 
undesirable by-products.  
 A process for preparing flunixin and pharmaceutically acceptable salts 
thereof, comprising: 
a) methylating a compound of the formula (III): 
 
wherein Z is hydrogen or a halo blocking group to give compound (V): 
 
wherein Z is defined as before; b) In a first alternative, for compounds of formula (V) wherein Z is a halo 
blocking group, contacting compound (V) with a reducing agent to give 
compound (VI): 
 
and hydrolyzing compound (VI) with acid to give 2-methyl-3-trifluoromethylaniline

In a second alternative, for compounds of formula (V) wherein Z is a 
halo blocking group, hydrolyzing compound (V) with acid to give 
compound (VII):  
 
 
wherein Z¹ is a halo blocking group; 
and contacting compound (VII) with a reducing agent to give MTA; or 
In a third alternative, for compounds of formula (V) wherein Z is H, 
separating compound (VI) from the reaction mixture; and hydrolyzing 
compound (VI) with acid to give MTA; or
