<ABSTRACT>
A high-purity titanium sputtering target having controlled 
crystal characteristics. Uniformity problem of film thickness 

distribution on a substrate can be solved by adopting 
requirements of that (a) the average crystal grain diameters 

at various portions of the sputtering surface of the target 
are 500 µm or less, preferably 100 µm or less, and their 

dispersions are within ± 20%, and (b) the defined 
orientation content ratios A have dispersions within± 20% and 

(c) a Ti target crystal structure has a recrystallization 
structure. The problems in connection with particle generation 

and lowered film forming rate in collimation sputtering can be 
solved by adopting the requirements that (d) said orientation 

content ratios A have is 80% or less, preferably 50% or less, 
and (e) the defined orientation content ratios B are 20% or 

less, as necessary, in combination with the aforementioned (a) 
to (c) requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high purity titanium sputtering
targets, and more specifically to sputtering targets of high
purity titanium having crystal characteristics notably
different from those in conventional titanium targets wherein
the average crystal grain diameter and optionally also crystal orientation
and further crystal structure are stipulated so as to meet
forthcoming requirements for the fabrication of future
semiconductor devices.Sputtering targets are usually disk-shaped plates, which
serve as sources of substances to be sputtered on substrates
to form thereon electrodes, gates, conductors, elements,
insulating films, protective films and the like of various
semiconductor devices. As accelerated particles impinge on a
target surface, the atoms constituting the target are partly
released by momentum exchange through the space to deposit
on an oppositely located substrate. Typical sputtering
targets in use include the targets made of Al and Al alloys,
refractory metals and their alloys (W, Mo, Ti, Ta, Zr, Nb,
etc. and their alloys such as W-Ti), and metal silicides
(MoSix, WSix, NiSix, etc.).Among these targets, one type attracting particular 
attention because of its importance is Ti targets for forming
Ti circuit lines or wirings, Ti protective films, etc..In recent years, wafers of 152 mm (6 inch) diameter have been
replaced by larger wafers of 203 mm (8 inch) diameter and circuit
lines have become finer to 0.5 µm or narrower in width.
Accordingly, the standards required for the uniformity of thin
films to be formed on wafers by sputtering have become
stricter to better secure the characteristics of the finer
circuit lines. Namely, compared with the former standard
deviation (σ) of dispersion of film thickness distribution
of 5% or less, the present-day requirement is that the
three-fold value of the standard deviation (3σ) should be
5% or less. Under these circumstances, reexamination of the
equipment, conditions, targets, and other parameters of
sputtering is under way with the aim of improving the
uniformity of thickness of the resulting films. It becomes
clear today that, with conventional Ti target quality,
different targets and even same target produce films with
thickness distribution so widely dispersed or varied that the
films are unable to meet the above standards (3σ < 5%).As important as the uniformity of film thickness, the
generation of particles during the formation of a sputtered
film is drawing much attention as a cause of circuit breaking
and shorting. Since the tendency
