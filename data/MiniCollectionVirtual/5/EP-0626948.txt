<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of 
curable compositions for coatings, adhesives and the like. 
More particularly, one aspect of this invention relates to 
novel epoxy resin curing accelerators and agents exhibiting 
latent catalysis and to one component epoxy resin 
formulations containing them. Other aspects of this 
invention relate to a process for forming a cured epoxy resin 
material that can be advantageously applied to production 
line-scale operations, and to certain curable compositions 
and their curing. The term "epoxy resin," as generally used in the art, 
refers to any molecule containing two or more epoxy groups. 
This technology had its genesis in research conducted in the 
United States and Europe just prior to World War II, and the 
interest in and production of epoxy resin has continued to 
grow since that time. Epoxy resins have proven to be 
enormously versatile compounds, and accordingly are used in 
thousands of industrial applications including adhesives, 
body solders, caulking compounds, casting compounds, 
sealants, potting and encapsulation compounds, and laminating 
resins. Epoxy-based solution and powder coatings are used as 
maintenance and product finishes, marine finishes, masonry 
finishes, structural steel coatings, tank coatings, aircraft 
finishes, automotive primers, can and drum linings, and 
collapsible-tube coatings, etc. For a further and more 
in-depth discussion of epoxy, resin technology from its 
beginnings, reference can be made to H. Lee and K. Neville, 
Handbook of Epoxy Resins, New York, McGraw Hill (1967). Many  
 
other publications are also available including numerous 
patents which can provide additional background relating to 
work in the area. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,004,952, 
2,909,494, 2,717,885, and 2,839,495, and English Patent Nos. 
955,748, 955,873, 956,044, and 963,058. The most valuable single property of epoxy resins is 
their ability to transform readily from the liquid (or 
thermoplastic) state to tough, hard thermoset solids upon 
mixing with a suitable curing agent (also referred to as a 
hardener, activator, or catalyst). It is often necessary to 
heat the resulting mixture in order to effect this 
transformation depending upon the precise epoxy resin and 
curing agent used. Lewis acid-amine complexes represent one general class of 
epoxy resin curing agents. (See C.A. May and Y. Tanaka, 
Epoxy Resins Chemistry and Technology, Marcel Dekker Inc., 
N.Y. 1973, p. 293). Various Lewis acid-amine complexes have
