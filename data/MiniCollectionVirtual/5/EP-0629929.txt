<ABSTRACT>
In an electrophotographic apparatus using a charging 
apparatus for contact charging, the charging apparatus 

comprises a flexible and hollow electrically conducting 
roller, made by a flexible and endless sheet (2) 

and an electrically conducting brush roller 
constituted of drive shaft and a brush (5) 

which is provided in the hollow roller in concentric 
therewith and are rotating at different speeds, wherein a 

charging voltage is applied to the hollow roller via the 
brush roller, and the photosensitive material (30) is 

electrically charged by rotating the hollow roller by 
bringing it into physical contact with the 

photosensitive material (30), and the hollow roller is 
brought at its both end portions into press-contact with 

the end portions on the surface of the photosensitive 
material (30) and is rotated being driven by the 

photosensitive material. In this apparatus, the hollow 
roller that comes into contact with the surface of the 

photosensitive material (30) is driven at substantially the 
same speed as the photosensitive material, whereby 

slipping and wear are effectively prevented from 
occurring on the surface of the photosensitive material, 

durability of the photosensitive material is not lost, 
the hollow roller that is subject to be easily deformed 

is effectively prevented from being twisted, enabling 
the electric charging to be carried out stably and 

uniformly for extended periods of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic apparatus using a charging apparatus 
for mainly charging the surface of a photosensitive 
material by contact charging. In an image-forming method based upon the 
electrophotographic method, an image is formed by 
uniformly charging the surface of a photosensitive 
material, exposing the surface of the photosensitive 
material to the image-bearing light to form on the 
surface of the photosensitive material an electrostatic 
latent image that corresponds to the image of the 
document, and developing and transferring the 
electrostatic latent image. In such an image-forming method, the surface of the 
photosensitive material is usually charged (mainly 
charged) by the corona charging accompanied, however, by 
the generation of ozone which contaminates the 
environment. In order to avoid the generation of ozone, 
a method has recently been proposed to mainly charge the 
surface of the photosensitive material by bringing an 
electrically conducting rubber roller into frictional 
contact with the surface of the photosensitive material 
while applying a bias voltage (Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publications Nos. 149669/1988 and 267667/1989). According to the above-mentioned charging method 
based upon the frictional contact, however, the presence 
of foreign matters such as dust, paper powder, etc. 
between the electrically conducting rubber roller and 
the photosensitive material impairs the uniformity in 
the charging, and makes it difficult to stably carry out  
 
the charging. In forming the image, furthermore, when 
the surface of the photosensitive material is not so 
clean permitting the toner to stay thereon, then the 
residual toner may stick to the surface of the 
photosensitive material to deteriorate the durability of 
the photosensitive material. To carry out the uniform 
charging, furthermore, application of the DC bias 
voltage only is not sufficient and an AC bias voltage 
must be applied in combination. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the 
present applicant has previously proposed a method of 
effecting the frictional charging by bringing a flexible 
and electrically conducting sheet into frictional 
contact with the surface of the photosensitive material 
by using a charging apparatus equipped with an 
electrically conducting brush roller while applying a DC 
voltage to the above roller (see Japanese Patent 
Application No. 68148/1992). The charging apparatus 
used for the above charging method usually comprises an 
ele
