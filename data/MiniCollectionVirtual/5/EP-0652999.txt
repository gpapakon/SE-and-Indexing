<ABSTRACT>
A permanently-installed form-drain (10) including hollow, foraminous planks (12) and connectors (16, 18) for joining two or more of the planks in a continuously arranged concrete barrier. The instant improvements include an adapter (20/21), which serves as a straight connector, grooved plank (19) with interlocking stake (13/14), integral connector-stake and adapter-stake device (16/14, 20/14) and a tri-functional, generally rigid bracket and bracket-stake (22 and 22/22x) element, used to space and restrain/constrain the planks and/or to hold (support) reinforcement bars.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED PERMANENTLY INSTALLED BUILDING FOUNDATION FORMThis is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. Patent Application S.N. 592,398 filed on October 3, 1990.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to structural footing forms and footing drains, and in particular, to a permanent concrete footing/foundation form having integral drain means and diverse connector elements. The instant invention improves on the connector elements of the genre.2. Relevant Art DiscussionForms comprising a plurality of planks, of varying lengths and having therein a plurality of foramens, are joined in straight or angular relationships to initially lay out the periphery of a building foundation or footing. It is a primary purpose of the forms in this invention to provide a containment for concrete which is to be poured as the footing or foundation of a building. Generally, two peripheral forms are used in spaced-apar , parallel array and the concrete disposed therebetween. Such is the thrust of my prior U.S. patent application Serial No. 592,358, filed on October 3, 1990, hereinafter incorporated by reference. To aid in the establishment of a structurally rigid footing/foundation form having integral drainage means, I have since improved the entire ensemble by 

providing adjunct mechanisms for the discrete connecting elements and by providing alternate spacer/constraining apparatus, the latter to be used with a full form ensemble, i.e. an inner and an outer form arrayed as aforesaid.Prior to my initial introduction of the integral foundation form-drain, some work had been done in the field to provide the tradesman with a permanently-installed footing or foundation form. U.S. Patent No . 3,613,323, issued to Hreha in 1971 inculcates a combination footing and drainage form in which the drainage means is integral with the essentially planar form. Hreha teaches the mitering of the forms so as to define and set out a completed, continuous building form. Holding the forms in place is accomplished by ordinary stakes which are literally driven through the conduit means of the ensemble by means of holes therein. Hreha teaches no particular technique which will accomplish the rapid spacing of the opposing foundations forms. The presence of staking holes further limits the Hreha teaching. In 1962, Smith was issued U.S. Patent No. 3,017,722 for his teaching of a hollow stringer element which could suffice as a partial foundation form and aid in the footing drainage scheme. Like Hreha, whom he

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A hollow multi-elemental, permanently installed concrete form-drain comprising: a plurality of hollow, essentially rectilinear and elongate planks, said planks being foraminous at one side thereof, nonforaminous at the other side, essentially continuous at a top and bottom thereof and having interior symmetry about a horizontal central plane; and at least one hollow, non-plank connecting element for joining two or more planks in an end-to-end configuration, said connecting element possessing a cross- sectional symmetry adapted for fitting it to a plank end, whereby connection of multiple planks with multiple connecting elements results in a continuous form having an inner peripheral structure and an outer peripheral structure for containment of concrete between the structures while, concomitantly, said connection provides continuous drainage through and about the structures.
2. The form-drain of Claim 1 wherein the connecting element is essentially straight.
3. The element of Claim 2 further comprising a straight, rectangular cross-sectioned, plank-shaped sleeve adapted to slide into a plank end.
4. The sleeve of Claim 3 further having a collar means transversely disposed peripherally and approximately midway 


thereabout.
5. The collar means of Claim 4 further comprising a stake.
6. The form-drain of Claim 1 wherein the connecting element is not straight.
7. The element of Claim 6 further comprising a stake.
8. The form-drain of Claim 1 further comprising an ιι-Lr ιι
shaped stake and planks and/or connecting elements having a continuous longitudinal groove, at least on the top thereof, for accepting thereinto a portion of the stake.
9. The stake of Claim 8 further characterized by a ledge means disposed between a head and tip of the stake.
10. A hollow multi-elemental, permanently installed concrete form-drain comprising: a plurality of hollow, essentially rectilinear and elongate planks, said planks being foraminous at one side thereof, nonforaminous at the other side, essentially continuous at a top and bottom thereof and having interior symmetry about a horizontal central plane; and at least one hollow, non-plank connecting element for joining two or more planks in an end-to-end configuration, said connecting element possessing a cross- sectional symmetry adapted for fitting it to a plank end. 



whereby connection of multiple planks with multiple connecting elements results in a continuous form having an inner peripheral structure and an outer peripheral structure for containment of concrete between the structures while, concomitantly, said connection provides continuous drainage through and about the structures; and a bracket means having essentially an "H" shape, the lateral portions thereof possessing a rectilinear shape adapted to partially circumscribe and enclose a portion of a plank so as to hold two said planks in essentially spaced-apart, parallel relationship.
11. The bracket of Claim 10 wherein at least one outside lateral portion is extended to effect a stake.
