<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to open transmission line 
systems of the kind used for determining the location of 
objects, things or people moving along a pathway and is 
especially applicable to so-called "guided radar" intrusion 
detection systems which use leaky cables as a transducer to 
detect human intrusions. Aspects of the invention are applicable whether the 
objects, things or people carry a radio transmitter, a 
receiver, a transponder or no electronics whatsoever. Known perimeter security sensors or intrusion detection 
systems utilizing open transmission lines incorporate a source 
of radio frequency energy as a component of the system. This 
can be used to set up a field around a transmission line which 
is monitored by a second parallel line or to set up a field 
from a central antenna which is monitored by an open 
transmission line. Guided radar type of intrusion detection 
systems have been developed using leaky coaxial cables. In 
most guided radar systems there are two parallel cables. One 
is used to distribute an electromagnetic field along the 
desired pathway and the parallel receive cable is used to 
monitor the field coupling between the two cables and thereby 
to detect movement of people or objects which disturb the 
coupling. Both continuous wave (cw) and pulsed type guided 
radars using leaky coaxial cables have been developed. 
Canadian patents numbers 1,216,340 and 1,014,245 by Keith 
Harman et al, both of which are incorporated herein by 
reference, describe two such guided radar systems. An alternative form of guided radar which uses a leaky 
coaxial cable to monitor the field set up by a central antenna 
is disclosed in Canadian patent No. 1,169,939, by Keith Harman 
et al. In order to minimize the number of nuisance or false 
alarms, this system tracks the phase angle which changes as 
the intruder crosses the cable.  A disadvantage of both such systems is that the 
transmitter which generates the field is part of the system 
and in general requires radio regulatory approval. The present invention seeks to overcome this disadvantage 
and to this end contemplates the use of an independent 
transmitter, for example an existing commercial radio or 
television station, as the source of the field which is 
subsequently used to detect intruders or other moving objects. According to one aspect the invention comprises an open 
transmission line system for locating a mobile entity along 
a defined pathway, said system being adapted to utilize 
transmissions from a remote
