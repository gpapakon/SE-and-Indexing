<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cigarette paper tube with filter tip for producing home-made cigarettes, which is characterised in that a further filter plug (10) is provided in the paper tube (2), its diameter being adapted to that of the paper tube in a manner such that the further filter plug (10) bears sealingly on the inner surface of the paper tube but is axially displaceable therein by gentle pressure when the paper tube is filled with a tobacco portion, and a method for producing such a cigarette paper tube, in which the further filter plug is arranged in the end of the paper tube opposite the filter tip, which method is characterised in that a strand of cigarette tube paper (2) is produced with consecutively arranged filter rods (4) bonded to the paper tube and unbonded filter rods (10), these filter rods having twice the length of the desired filter plugs of the finished cigarette paper tube, and a through cut being made in each case at the centre of the bonded filter tip rods and of the displaceable filter rods.

Cigarette paper tube with filter tip for making your own cigarettes, said paper
tube being manufactured on a cigarette paper tube machine, in which the

filter tip is formed from a first filter plug (4), which is connected by a glue
coating (6) at the mouth-side end to the inner surface of the paper tube (2),

whose outer surface is surrounded by a tip wrapper (8) projecting from one
tip end optionally to over and beyond the area of the first filter plug (4), a

further filter element being provided, characterized in that the further filter
element comprises one or more filter plugs (10) located in the paper tube (2)

and whose outer diameter is 0.05 to 0.2 mm smaller than the inner diameter
of the cigarette paper tube and is thereby adapted to that of the paper tube in

such a way that the further filter plug or plugs (10) tightly engage on the
inner surface of the paper tube, but by slight pressure on filling the paper

tube with a tobacco portion are axially movable into said tube, and that one
of the movable filter plugs (10) is located in the end of the paper tube (2)

opposite to the filter tip.
Cigarette paper tube according to claim 1, characterized in that one movable
further filter plug (10) is located at a distance of 2 to 15 mm from the first

filter plug (4) in the tube; (fig. 2).
Cigarette paper tube according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the paper
tube (2) has, at a distance of 2 to 15 mm from the filter tip (4), a constriction

or indentation (16) arranged in circular manner, which give a slight reduction
of the internal diameter of the paper tube and which are optionally widenable

by the movable further filter plug (10). 
Cigarette paper tube according to claim 3, characterized in that the
constriction or indentation (16) is provided on the area of the wrapper (8)

projecting over and beyond the first filter plug (4) or in the marginal area
thereof.
Cigarette paper tube according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the tip
wrapper (8) has in the vicinity of the filter tip (4) and/or in the spacing area

between the filter tip and the indentation or constriction (16) perforations
(14) for the entry of secondary air.
Cigarette paper tube according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the tip
wrapper has perforations in the vicinity of the filter tip and/or in the spacing

area between the filter tip and the movable filter plug (10) located therein.
Method for producing a cigarette paper tube according to claim 1,
characterized in that a cigarette tube paper strand is produced with

successively arranged filter rods glued to the paper tube und unglued filter
rods, said filter rods having twice the length of the desired filter plug of the

finished cigarette paper tube and is in each case cut through in the centre of
the glued filter rods and the movable filter rods which correspond to the

movable filter plugs (10) located in the end of the paper tube (2) opposite to
the filter tip.
