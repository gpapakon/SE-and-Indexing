<ABSTRACT>
Fluorinated alkene compounds useful for and methods of controlling nematodes, insects, and acarids that prey on agricultural crops. Polar compounds, for example, 3,4,4-trifluoro-3-butene-1-amine or 3,4,4-trifluoro-3-butenoic acid, are particularly useful for systemic control of pests. Novel method and intermediates for the preparation of 3,4,4-trifluoro-3-butene-1-amine are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain
fluoroalkenyl compounds, including, mono, di, and
trifluoroalkenylamines, trifluoroalkenylcarboxylic
acids, their derivatives and salts, and formulated
compositions thereof. It also related to methods of
controlling pests that prey on agricultural crops, such
as nematodes, insects, and acarids. A novel method of
preparing a trifluoroalkenylamine and novel
intermediates for this method are also provided.Fluorinated alkenes have long been known to
control nematodes and insects when applied to the soil.
U.S. Patent Numbers 3,510,503, 3,654,333, and 3,780,050
all disclose such compounds. More recently, U.S. Patent
Number 4,952,580 disclosed polyhaloalkenes useful as
nematocides, some of which were said to have some
downward systemic activity, that is, would control to
some extent nematode infestation of the root system
after application to the plant foliage. The majority of
the compounds disclosed by these patents are nonpolar,
which is a desirable characteristic for soil-applied
pesticides, providing longer effective periods, but is
much less effective for foliar application to achieve
systemic effects. U.S. Patent Number 4,950,666
discloses some polar difluoroalkenylalkane compounds
useful as systemic insecticides and nematocides.
However, there remains a need in the art for nematode,
insect, and acarid control agents having improved
systemic mobility, and desirably with low effective
levels of use. The present invention provides compounds, useful
for controlling nematode, insect, and acarid infestation
of a plant, having the structure

wherein
n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11;Q is CH2NHR6, CH2NO2, CH2N=CHR2, CH2N=C=O, CH2N+R3R4R5W-,
or (C=O)-R11;X, Y, and Z are independently H or F, provided that at
least one of X and Y is F, and further provided
that when Q is (C=O)-R11 each of X, Y, and Z is F;W- is an agronomically acceptable anion;R2 is an aromatic group;each of R3, R4, and R5 is independently hydrogen; a lower
alkyl group, optionally substituted with at least
one group selected from hydroxy, alkoxy, halo,
nitro, amino, thiol, alkylthio, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl,
and phenyl; one of R3, R4, and R5 is
hydroxy and the other two are hydrogen; or R3, R4,
and R5 taken together with the nitrogen of Q form
a cyclic quaternary ammonium group;R6 is hydrogen; an aliphatic group, optionally
substituted with at least one group selected from
hydroxy, alkoxy, halo, nitro, amino, thiol,
alkylthio, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, and phenyl;
an amino acid amide of Q; (C=O)-R7; C1-C12
