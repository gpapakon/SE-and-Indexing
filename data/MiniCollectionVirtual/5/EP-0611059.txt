<ABSTRACT>
A DC restorer device for restoring the DC and non-zero 
average components of a serially transmitted binary signal which has 

been AC coupled. The device comprises an input port for receiving the 
binary signal, a clamping circuit, a feedback network, a summing node, 

and an output port. The input port is connected to a capacitor for AC 
coupling the binary signal to the summing node. The clamping circuit 

is also connected to the summing node. The feedback network 
includes an input and an output which are also connected to the 

summing node. The clamping circuit clamps the positive and 
negative peaks of the AC coupled binary signal which exceed a 

predetermined range. The feedback network latches the AC coupled 
binary signal and produces a feedback current. For a binary signal 

which is within the predetermined range, the clamping circuit exhibits 
a very high input impedance, thereby causing the feedback current to 

charge the coupling capacitor. The coupling capacitor produces a 
voltage which is added to the AC coupled binary signal at the 

summing node. The output port which is part of the feedback network 
takes the restored AC coupled binary signal and converts it to digital 

logic levels using a comparator. In another embodiment, the clamping 
circuit includes a current sensor for producing an amplitude signal 

which is indicative of the amplitude of the AC coupled binary signal. 
The amplitude signal is fed to an automatic gain controller which 

produces a gain control voltage for controlling the operation of a high 
frequency equalizer. The second embodiment of the present invention 

provides a DC restorer which can be merged with an automatic gain 
controller to provide an integrated cable equalizer in which the DC 

restorer and high frequency equalizer co-operate to produce a matched 
and high performance cable equalizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to direct current (DC) restoration
of serially transmitted binary signals. More particularly, the invention
relates to a hysteretic bipolar clamp DC restorer circuit particularly
suited for use with automatic co-axial cable equalizers.In signal transmission applications where the average or
DC component of a serially transmitted binary signal is non-zero, the
DC component of the signal must be restored at the receiver in order
to achieve accurate data reproduction. Where the transmission
medium is a coaxial cable which includes AC coupling methods for
signal transmission, there are two steps required to recover the
transmitted data. The first step involves high frequency equalization
to compensate for losses during transmission in the cable. The second
step involves DC restoration of the equalized signal to recover the low
frequency and DC components which are lost through the coupling
circuits.Quantized Feedback (QFB) is the standard technique for
DC restoration of an AC coupled binary signal. The Quantized
Feedback method has been utilized in practical implementations for
cable equalizers for serial digital transmission applications. However,
the Quantized Feedback method is sensitive to variations in the
amplitude and rise time of the input waveform. As will be appreciated
by one skilled in the art, this sensitivity places considerable emphasis
on the performance of the high frequency equalizer because as the
length of the transmission cable increases, the signal losses become
more severe and precise equalization will eventually be impossible.As 
a result of this sensitivity, the Quantized Feedback method
can introduce jitter into the restored waveform.The present invention provides a new approach to DC
restoration which, unlike the Quantized Feedback technique,
can operate correctly over a wide variation of input signal
quality, and therefore is inherently better suited for the
role of DC restorer in cable equalizers.In a first aspect, the present invention provides a
device for restoring a binary signal having a DC value, the
binary signal being coupled to said device by a capacitor,
said device comprising: an input port coupled to the capacitor
for receiving the binary signal and producing a coupled binary
signal; clamping means for clamping the coupled binary signal
when said coupled binary signal exceeds a predetermined range,
said clamping means being connected to the capacitor; means
for generating a signal component, said means for generating
being coupled between the
