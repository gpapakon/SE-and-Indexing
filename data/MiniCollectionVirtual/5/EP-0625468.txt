<ABSTRACT>
A two-component aerosol can, in particular for two-component foams, having a valve, an outer container (1) for a first component and propellent, and an inner container (23) which is closed off in relation to the outer container for the second component and possibly a further propellent, wherein a tubular element (21) extending in the direction of the can bottom (17) is arranged in the outer container (1) below the valve plate (6) and wherein the inner container (23) is fixed releasably to the lower end of the tubular element (21) and is sealed off hermetically by a sealing element (36) relative to the interior of the tubular element (21), the valve tube (12) having, on its part which protrudes through the valve element (9) into the outer container (1), an engagement element (26) which engages in a receiving fixture (30), of complementary design, of a threaded element (22), and the threaded element (22) engages with an external thread (31) into an internal thread (32) of the tubular element (21), arranged above the inner container (23), so that a rotary movement of the valve tube is transmitted via the engagement element (26) to the threaded element (29), and the downward movement of the threaded element (28), thus caused, shoots the inner container (21) off.

Two-component aerosol can, in particular for 2-component foams, 
comprising a valve, said valve comprising a valve body and a valve tube, an 

outer container (1) for a first component and foaming agent and an inner 
container (23), sealed against the outer container, for the second component 

and optionally additional foaming agent, in which at the outer container (1) 
underneath the valve disk (6) is arranged a tube (21) extending toward the 

bottom (17) of the can, and at the bottom of the tube (21) is affixed in a 
detachable manner the inner container (23), and is hermetically sealed by a 

gasket (36) against the inside of tube (21), the valve tube (12) having a 
contact element (26) on its section (15) extending through the valve body (9) 

into the outer container (1), that meshes into a complementary shaped 
recess (30) of an assembly (22), the downward movement of which separates 

the inner container (23), characterized in that the assembly (22) is formed 
as a screw assembly (22) and engages with an outside thread (31) into an 

inside thread (32) of the tube (21) provided above the inner container (23), 
so that a rotary motion of the valve tube is transmitted by the contact 

element (26) to the srew assembly (22). 
Aerosol can according to claim 1, characterized in that the tube (21) rests in 
a concentric flange (20) of the valve disk (6) that extends into the inside of 

the can, whereby a recess running prallel to the inside edge of the tube (21) 
engages into the flange (20) of the valve disk (6). 
Aerosol can according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the tube (21) 
comprises at its valve-facing end an inside groove for the engaging of a 

concentric flange (19) of the valve body (9).  
 
Aerosol can according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, charcterized in that the 
tube comprises openings (24) in the wall near its valve-facing end. 
Aerosol can according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
contact element (26) is housed vertically displaceable in the recess (30). 
Aerosol can according to anyone of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
contact element (26) consists of a hexagon (26) arranged at the disk (15) of 

the valve tube (12), and that it engages into a hexagonal recess (30) in the 
screw assembly (22). 
Aerosol can according to claim 6, characterized in that the disk (5) of the 
valve tube (12) engages into a circular widening (28) of the srew assembly 

(22), and that it is provided with an outside gasket (33) that presses agaisnt 
the circular widening (28). 
Aerosol can according to anyone of claim 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
srew assembly (22) is provided with a gasket (34) in the wall region above 

the thread (31), that presses against the inside wall of the tube (21). 
Aerosol can according to claim 8, characterized in that the inner container 
(23) is inserted at its top into the tube (21), whereby between the outer wall 

of the inner container (23) and the inside wall of the tube (21) is provided a 
gasket (36) that presses against the inside wall of the tube (21). 
Aerosol can according to anyone of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the 
valve tube (12) is provided with a handling aid to boost the rotary motion.
