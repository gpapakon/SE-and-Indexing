<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a moulding device comprising a moulding block (1) having a moulding cavity (2) therein. A chamber (5) is connected to the cavity (2) in which a piston (4) slides. There is a closing means (6) provided between the chamber (5) and the cavity (2) which is moveable from a first position in which the mouth of the chamber (5) is sealed to allow the chamber (5) to be charged with a molten substance whilst the piston (4) is retracted, to one or more further positions which allow the molten substance to be injected directly into the cavity (2) when the piston (4) is activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to moulding
devices, in particular, high pressure die casting
machines and is particularly, although not
exclusively, concerned with the production of metal
castings having low porosity.There are a number of high pressure die casting
devices/machines in use but many produce cast
articles which have a high degree of porosity. If
the level of porosity is allowed to rise above
certain limits, the pores can adversely affect the
properties of the component so as to lead to the
failure or deterioration of the cast article during
use (most porosity remains internal; only if the die
castings are machined is the porosity usually
exposed). Therefore, in any high pressure die
casting device, an object will be to reduce the
porosity levels as close to zero as possible.A high pressure die casting (hpdc) machine
which is used extensively is the "cold chamber" hpdc
machine which manufactures aluminium alloys. This
machine operates by transferring molten metal from a
shot sleeve into a die cavity by means of a high
velocity piston or plunger. The molten metal is
forced along a series of channels or a runner system
and through a fixed, narrow gate or opening into the
die cavity. The liquid metal is then effectively
sprayed through the gate to produce a first coating
over the surface of the die cavity and then the
remainder of the liquid metal is introduced into the
cavity to complete the cast article. The first
coating of liquid metal commonly produces a very fine
grain surface layer having a very smooth surface 
finish. However, the cold chamber hpdc process
suffers from two major disadvantages. First, because
the molten metal has to flow through a runner system
of channels, its temperature will fall by the time it
reaches the narrow gate and consequently, it will
freeze around the narrow gate which reduces the
pressure which can be transmitted effectively from
the runner and gate onto the metal in the die
cavity. The reduction in pressure transmission will
produce die castings which are notoriously porous and
may, therefore, not be heat treatable for fear of
blistering. Furthermore, subsequent machining
operations will expose the porosity which causes a
high rejection rate. Secondly, the cold chamber hpdc
process is commonly only about 33% efficient because
approximately 50% of the cast metal (i.e in the
runner and gate sections) needs to be removed from
each casting for remelting. Moreover, since there is
an additional casting scrap rate of 5-15% the
efficiency of the cold chamber hpdc

A moulding device comprising a moulding
block (1) defining a moulding cavity (2) therein, a

chamber (5) connected to the cavity (2) in which a
piston (4) is slidable, and a closing means (6)

between the chamber (5) and the cavity (2), the
closing means being moveable from a first position, in

which the mouth of the chamber (5) is sealed to allow
the chamber to be charged with a molten substance

whilst the piston (4) is in a retracted position, to
one or more further positions which allow the molten

substance to be injected directly into the cavity (2)
when the piston (4) is activated, characterised in

that the closing means (6) is moveable to a second
position in which the closing means is less open than

when the closing means is in the or each said further
position, and the closing means is spaced at a small

distance from the mouth of the chamber (5) to define a
narrow orifice (7) which allows a fine spray or jet or

film of molten substance to be forced through the
orifice and be deposited on the inner surface of the

cavity (2) when the piston is activated.
A device as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the closing means (6) can be

moved into a third position which allows a less
restricted entry of molten substance into the cavity

(2).
A device as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the closing means (6) slides

through a wall of the cavity (2).
A device as claimed in Claim 3,
characterised in that the closing means (6) slides 

through a wall of the cavity (2) opposite to the mouth
of the chamber (5) into the cavity (2).
A device as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4,
characterised in that when the closing means (6) is

fully retracted it forms part of the inner surface of
the cavity (2).
A device as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that the closing means (6) is

provided with channels which allow evacuation of gas
from the moulding cavity (2).
A device as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that the closing means (6) is a

pillar which is slidable in a sleeve (8).
A device as claimed in Claim 7,
characterised in that a copper alloy collar is

provided between the pillar (6) and sleeve (8) to
increase conduction of heat away from the device.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim
for use in high-pressure die casting or indirect

squeeze casting of metals.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the moulding cavity (2)

comprises a plurality of moulding sub-cavities.
A method of moulding an article in a
moulding device according to any one of the preceding

claims, the moulding device comprising a moulding
block (1) defining a moulding cavity (2) therein and a

chamber (5) connected to the cavity (2) in which a
piston (4) is slidable, comprising the steps of

closing the mouth of the chamber (5), charging the 
chamber (5) with a molten 
substance, and opening the
mouth to the block (1) to directly inject the molten

substance into one or more moulding cavities (2)
within the moulding block (1) by moving the piston (4)

mouth to the block (1) is partially opened to define a

A method as claimed in Claim 11 or Claim 12,
