<ABSTRACT>
In a roller chain for drawing in webs of material, in particular into a web-fed rotary printing machine, the object is to provide a light roller chain for drawing in a web of material, which roller chain has good spatial mobility despite using straps. According to the invention, this is achieved in that a leaf spring-like strap (6), which holds the pins at a particular distance from one another, is provided between running rollers (2,3) of a pair of running rollers arranged in each case on one pin (4).

<CLAIMS>
A roller chain using plates (6, 14, 33) and pins (4), there 
being mounted on the pins (4) both rollers (2, 3; 18, 19) and the 

plates (6, 14, 33), which are provided with bearing bores (9) at 
their ends (7, 8), the rollers (2, 3; 18, 19) being mounted in 

each case in pairs on the pin (4), that in each case two adjacent 
spaced pairs of rollers (2, 3; 18, 19) are connected by means of 

at least one plate (6; 14; 33) of the leaf-spring type arranged 
between the rollers (2, 3; 18, 19), characterized in that the 

plates (6; 14; 32) are constructed to be fork-shaped at their 
first end (7) and flat at their second end (8), and in that in 

each case the second, flat end (8) is mounted in the fork-shaped 
end (7) of the next pair of rollers (2, 3; 18; 19) on the pin 

(4). 
A roller chain according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the plate (6; 14; 33) has a cutout (11) extending in the 

direction (10) of its longitudinal axis. 
A roller chain according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that provided between the bearing bore (9; 16) in the plate 

(6; 14), in the direction of the ends (7, 8) of the plate (6; 
14), is a slot (17) which is open at one side and which has a 

width which is smaller than the diameter of the bearing bore 
(16).
