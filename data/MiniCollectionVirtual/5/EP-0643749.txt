<ABSTRACT>
A composition comprising a colour pigment component and a light conditioning component characterized by being a transducing material having the ability to absorb light and reflect at least part of the light absorbed, thereby modifying the light in the coating resulting from the application of the composition. Such light conditioning component includes any material having the ability to partially absorb light. Preferred are neutral grey pigments in the form of grey powders having a minimal colour producing effect. The pigments can be in the form of ground grey powders such as powders taken from granite, feldspar, quartz or limestone or in the form of spherical metallic particles such as metallic zinc. In one embodiment the grey powder is in physical admixture with the colour pigments and serves to space the pigments apart from one another. In a variant the grey powder and the colour pigments are contained in respective superposed layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Light-modifying composition. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to surface coatings such as paints. In particular, the invention, in its simplest form, relates to a composition comprising a colour pigment component and a light conditioning component characterized by being a transducing material having the ability to absorb light and reflect at least part of the light absorbed, thereby modifying the light in the coating resulting from the application of the composition. Such pigment spacing component includes any material having the ability to partially absorb light. Preferred are neutral grey pigments in the form of grey powders having a minimal colour producing effect. The pigments can be in the form of ground grey powders such as powders taken from granite, feldspar, quartz or limestone or in the form of spherical metallic particles such as metallic zinc. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe coating industry is one of considerable importance in the industrialized world. It has ramifications extending in various technological areas. Hence, paints have been designed for the protection and decoration of masonry coatings, ferrous metals, non- ferrous metals, wood substrates and the like. Also, paints have been designed to provide special properties to the surface on which they are applied. Examples include the pigmentation of anti-foulants, electrocoatings, flame resistant and intumescent paints, heat-resistant paints and fluorescent paints. Pigments have also been used to prepare inks and to colour paper goods. Other examples of use of coatings include the pigmentation of rubbers, plastics, cosmetics, magnetic tapes, food, textiles, adhesives and ceramics. 

 ith current technology, almost any type of coating composition prepared comprises binders, pigments and extenders which are combined to obtain the desired result. The most commonly used pigment is titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is insoluble in all liquids, with the exception of concentrated sulphuric acid and hydrofluoric acid. Titanium dioxide molecules produce a highly reflective white powder. The paint industry has by far the most widely diversified manufacturing requirements because each basic paint type such as flat, semi-gloss and enamel require different kinds and amounts of treatments using titanium dioxide. Still, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment by a large number of major industries such as paints, paper, plastics, rubbers, floor coverings, printing inks, ceramics, coated fabrics and roofing granules.
