<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a mould, according to the preamble
of claim 1.The mould according to this invention is employed to
produce thin slabs, and also advantageously medium slabs,
suitable for subsequent rolling for the production of sheet
or strip (coils).The mould according to the invention has the purpose of
producing slabs from 800 mm. to 3000 mm., or more, wide with
thicknesses which may vary from 30 mm. to 90 mm. in the case
of thin slabs and from 90 mm. to 150 mm. in the case of
medium slabs.Moulds for the continuous casting of thin slabs are
disclosed in the state of the art.US-A-2,564,723 teaches the inclusion of a casting chamber
in an intermediate position in the wide sides of the mould;
this casting chamber has a surface conformed as a rhombus
and not only enables a reserve of liquid metal to be formed
which can thus feed the zone of the narrow sides but also
enables the discharge nozzle of the tundish to be inserted
so as to discharge liquid metal below the meniscus.Next, it is necessary in the field of the rolling of sheet
or strip that rolling campaigns should be carried out with
different widths so as to meet market requirements.US-A-4,134,441 therefore teaches the displacement of the
narrow sides of the mould during the casting process so as
to produce programmed widths of thin slabs.SU-A-143.215 and JP-A-51-112730 disclose casting chambers
with a curved peripheral development so as to prevent
lengthwise cracks due to the sliding of the solidification 
skin, which has to take up substantial developments to
arrive at the outlet section.EP-C-149.734 includes the teachings of all these documents
of the prior art and sets them forth in a coordinated manner
so as to arrive at the same identical purposes.All these documents of the prior art and also the present
existing state of the art regarding thin slabs, namely slabs
with a thickness of about an average value of 50 to 60 mm.,
provide for the casting chamber to extend vertically by
about a quarter to a third, or by a maximum of a half, of
the length of the mould. This condition, however, retains
considerable problems of stress and strain on the skin while
leaving the casting chamber and adapting itself to the
surrounding walls.So as to lessen these problems partly, very long and
gently curved connecting portions have been provided in the
zone of the change of direction, but these proposed
embodiments do not obviate the existence of great
metallurgical problems which reduce the withdrawal speed and
the quality of the resulting product
