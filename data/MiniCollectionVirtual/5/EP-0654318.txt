A machine for fine machining the tooth profiles of gear-shaped
workpieces (W) with an internally toothed tool (T),

with

a) a machine bed (2) and a drivable horizontal slide (7),
displaceable thereon and controlled for that purpose, for

moving a tool head (13) in the X-direction, i.e. at right
angles to the axis (C2) of the workpiece (W) to be machined,

the tool head (13) serving to hold the internally toothed tool
(T) so that it is drivable rotationally, and being angularly

adjustable in a circular guide (12) about an axis (A) lying in
the X-direction,
b) a headstock (3) and a tailstock (4) for holding the
workpiece (W) to be machined so that it is drivable

rotationally, the said headstock and tailstock being provided
on either side of the tool head (13) on the machine bed (2),

wherein

b1) the tailstock (4) is movable on the machine bed (2) in the
Z-direction, i.e. in the direction of the workpiece axis (C2),

and wherein
b2) a controllable relative movement between the tool head
(13) and the headstock (3) or tailstock (4) in the Z-direction

and automatic feed and removal of the workpieces (W) or a
dressing tool instead of a workpiece (W) is provided,

characterised in that
c) the horizontal slide (7) is arranged directly on the
machine bed (2) and carries a vertical slide (9) which has the

circular guide (12) and which is displaceable in the Y-direction,
i.e. perpendicularly to the X- and Z-direction, and

is drivable for that purpose, and
d) the headstock (3) is also movable in the Z-direction and is
drivable for that purpose and the tailstock (4), appropriately

controlled, is able to follow, both in order to effect the
relative movement between the tool (T) and the workpiece (W)

in the Z-direction and to handle the tool (W) and the dressing 
tool.
A machine according to claim 1, characterised by an
integral handling system (25) for conveying a workpiece (W) to

be machined into a transfer position (24) laterally adjacent
to the tool head (13) and for removing a machined workpiece

(W) from this position (24) or for conveying and removing the
dressing tool, wherein the workpiece (W) or the dressing tool

in the transfer position (24) may be received or released by
clamping devices (17, 18) which belong to the headstock (3)

and the tailstock (4) which are movable an appropriate
distance in the Z-direction for the handling operation, with a

frame (26) connected to the machine frame (1) and devices (28)
displaceably guided thereon for picking up, conveying and

delivering the workpieces (W) or the dressing tool, these
devices (28) being arranged close to the side of the

horizontal slide (7) directed towards the headstock (3) and
being displaceable parallel to the X- and/or Y-direction on

the frame (26) in a U-direction or V-direction.
