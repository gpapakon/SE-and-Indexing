<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a regiospecific process for the 
preparation of 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-propan-2-ol 

derivatives of the general formulas I and Ia: 

 
wherein: 

R
is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl optionally 
substituted by one or more same or different halogen 

groups; and 
X
is the anion of a strong acid; 
 
 
comprising reacting an oxirane acid salt of the general 
formula II:  
 
wherein R and X are as defined above; or reacting an oxirane 
of the general formula II': 


wherein R and X are as defined above, under acidic 
conditions, with 4H-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole of the 

formula III: 

and optionally deaminating a compound of the formula Ia 
to form a compound of formula I.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a regiospecific
process for the preparation of 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-propan-2-ol
derivatives.More particularly, the present invention relates to an
improved process for the preparation of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1,3-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propan-2-ol,
which is also known by the generic name fluconazole (IV):

and which is useful in the treatment of fungal infections in
animals and in humans.The preparation of fluconazole (IV) by alternative
processes has been described in British Patent
No. 2,099,818.A first process involves reacting a compound of the
formula V: 

where Q is a facile leaving group, with 1,2,4-triazole
wherein Q is Cl or Br.A second possible process is reacting an oxirane of the
formula VI:

with 1,2,4-triazole.In both cases, these reactions are not regiospecific
and two isomers are observed in the product mixture. In
British Patent 2,099,818 it is stated that, "the product
will generally be contaminated with the isomer in which one
of the triazole rings is attached to the adjacent CH2 via
the 4-position." Therefore, the process of British Patent
2,099,818 discloses the need for column chromatography to
isolate the desired product from the side product
iso-fluconazole.This lack of regiospecifity in the fluconazole process,
as described in British Patent 2,099,818, leads to the 
following disadvantages: low overall yield; requirement for
column chromatography; lack of suitability for usual
industrial production conditions, and final product
contamination with iso-fluconazole.In contradistinction to the teachings of said British
patent, there has now been surprisingly discovered,
according to the present invention, a regiospecific process
for the preparation of 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-propan-2-ol
derivatives of the general formulas I and Ia:

wherein:
Ris alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl optionally
substituted by one or more same or different halogen
groups; andXis the anion of a strong acid;
comprising reacting an oxirane acid salt of the general
formula II: 

wherein R and X are as defined above; or reacting an oxirane
of the general formula II':

wherein R and X are as defined above, under acidic
conditions, with 4H-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole of the
formula III:

and optionally deaminating a compound of the formula Ia
to form a compound of formula I.In preferred embodiments of the present invention the
process will be carried out with an oxirane acid salt of the
general formula II as defined above rather than with an
oxirane of the general
