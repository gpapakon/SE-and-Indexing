<ABSTRACT>
Carborane substituted porphyrin compounds selectively inhibit viral aspartyl proteases, and are useful in treating infections such as AIDS as well as uses in treating solid tumors. Particularly preferred treatments in accordance with the invention use the dipotassium salt of 2,4-bis-((alpha),(beta)-(1,2-dicarbaclosododecaborane carboxy)ethyl)deuteroporphyrin complexed with a metal or a transition metal, which is well solubilized in water, and is suitable for oral administration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
porphyrins, and more particularly to porphyrins with
hydrophobic glycol derivative substituents at pyrrole
ring positions 2 and 4 and that are complexed with
metals and to its use in the preparating of a medicament effective
for the treatment of retroviral diseases.U.S. Patent 4,959,356, issued September 25,
1990, inventors Miura and Gabel describe boronated
porphyrin compounds for use in boron neutron capture
theory (BNCT). Similar compounds are discussed in an
article by Miura et al. Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 31,
No. 16, pp. 2247-2250 (1990). The boronated porphyrins
described by Miura have vinyl carborane moieties that
she reports as not being water soluble. Thus she must
open the borane cages. But by opening those borane
cages, one encounters significantly more toxicity for
the compounds. Moreover, the resultant open-cage
compounds are still not sufficiently water soluble to
enable administration without the use of adjuvant
substances (e.g., polyethylene glycol). Also the
compounds which Miura et al. describe are (at most) 19%
boron by weight in the physiologically useful (K+-salt) 
form. This is a disadvantage since limiting human doses
may well be determined by the amount of porphyrin unit
doses which may be tolerated.In addition to neutron capture therapy (NCT)
generally and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) more
specifically, additional uses of porphyrins in cancer
therapies are those therapeutic strategies generally
referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). A review
article by Delaney and Glatstein in Comprehensive
Therapy, pp. 43-55 (May 1988) describes this therapeutic
strategy where a light-activated photosynthesizer can
interact with ground state molecular oxygen to yield
reactive oxygen species (via singlet oxygen). Since
porphyrins of many structural types localize in a wide
variety of malignant tumors, this localization has
formed the basis for treatment of at least 3000 patients
in the United States alone (twice that worldwide) over
the past several years through PDT. Complete response
(disappearance of tumor or biopsy proven) has occurred
in a high percentage of patients in relatively advanced
stages of skin, bladder, and lung cancers, and cancers
of the reproductive system through photodynamic therapy.The rapid spread of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), believed the causative agent of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), throughout the world
has prompted an intense search for anti-retroviral
therapeutics. Des Jarlais et al. have
