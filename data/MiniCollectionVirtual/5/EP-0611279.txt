<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plant raising device for use in
supplying water and nutrients to growing plants. The
invention is particularly effective when used with a growing
bag, and the invention extends to a method of raising plants
in a growing bag.Growing bags are widely used for growing a variety of crops
such as tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers and are used by both
professional nurserymen and amateur gardeners. Growing bags
comprise a plastic (usually polyethylene) bag containing a
compost-like growing medium. To use the bags, they are laid
on a flat surface, holes are cut in one wall of the bag to
expose the growing medium, and a plant is planted in the
growing medium.The term 'growing bag' as used in this specification
includes any type of bag-like structure which contains a
moisture retaining medium in which plants can be grown. The
moisture retaining medium may be compost or may be some
other medium to which plant nutrients can be added as
necessary.Growing bags have been successful because they offer an
easily locatable and easily replaceable growing medium. The
gardener can place them wherever he chooses.There are however problems arising from the use of growing
bags. Firstly, when the growing medium is watered, there is
a tendency for some of this medium to be washed out of the
top of the bag and onto the surrounding ground. Secondly,
watering takes a long time and is imprecise, since the water
can only be applied over a relatively small area of the
growing medium. Thirdly, the plant roots tend to grow 
towards the most moist part of the growing medium and
therefore they tend to work towards the surface of the
growing medium, rather than extending down into the medium.It is known from WO84/02827 to make holes in one face of a
growing bag and to insert in these holes plant containers in
which plants can grow. In this case, the plants have to be
watered directly into these plant containers, onto the top
of the plant growing medium.According to the present invention, there is provided a
plant raising device, the device comprising a body,
an opening through the body for receiving plant growing medium,
a water trough surrounding the opening with holes for the
passage of water formed through the walls of the trough, and
a downwardly extending annular wall arranged beneath the
trough, radially outside the holes through the walls of the
trough.The device is preferably moulded from plastics material, and
to assist the moulding process, the walls form, when seen in
cross-section, a generally

<CLAIMS>
A plant raising device, the device comprising a body,
an opening through the body for receiving plant growing

medium, a water trough (32; 62) surrounding the opening with
holes (36) for the passage of water formed through the walls of the

trough (32), and a downwardly extending annular wall (38) arranged
beneath the trough (32; 62), radially outside the holes (36).
A plant raising device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the bottom edge of the wall has bag wall cutting or

perforating means.
A plant raising device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim
2, wherein the inner wall of the water trough bounds the

opening and is higher than the outer wall of the trough.
A plant raising device as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the opening is surrounded on all sides by the

trough.
A plant raising device as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the trough is annular.
A plant raising device as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein 
the body is moulded in one piece from
plastics material.
A plant raising device as claimed in Claim 6, wherein
the walls of the trough form, when seen in cross-section,

generally frusto-conical shapes.
A plant raising device as claimed in Claim 7, wherein
the walls have steps formed in them with the steps lying

generally normal to the axis of the body, with the holes 
being formed in the steps, and thus parallel to the axis of

the body.
A plant raising device as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the open top of the trough is provided with

a covering of a mesh or the like.
A plant raising device as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the water trough includes water volume

measuring means.
A method of raising plants in a growing bag, wherein a
hole is cut in a top panel of the bag, a plant raising

device which has a water trough surrounding an opening in
which a plant can be grown and a downwardly extending

annular wall arranged beneath the trough is placed in the
hole to extend downwardly into the growing bag and the water

trough is arranged so that water can flow from the trough
into the hole.
A method as claimed in Claim 11, wherein the water
trough has a known volume and is arranged so that the water

can flow out of the trough at a slower rate than it can be
poured into the trough.
