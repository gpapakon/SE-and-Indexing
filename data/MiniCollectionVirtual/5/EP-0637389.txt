<DESCRIPTION>
 INJECTION MOLDED OPTICAL COUPLING ELEMENTSTECHNICAL FIE PThe present invention relates generally to optical couplers, and more specifically to injection molded optical elements having molded optical junctions with at least an integrally formed input or output portion projecting outwardly from the coupler body defining an angle less than about twenty five degrees with the propagation axis of the element and a continuous waveguiding profile, that is, free from lateral discontinuities.BftCKgRPUNP OF INVENTIONPassive devices for coupling optical signals are well- known to those of skill , in the art. U. S. Patent No. 4,590,619 to einer discloses a star coupler for an optical data bus system including a plurality of incoming and outgoing optical waveguides. In one embodiment, the coupler includes a mixing plate fitted with parallel oriented input and output fibers.U. S . Patent No. 4,995,692 discloses and claims an optical star coupler based on a curved optical ribbon as the mixing element. Optical fibers are optically connected to the ribbon element by way of a multi-apertured block.U. S. Patent No. 4,484,794 to Witte et al. shows a multi-layer star coupler wherein optical fibers are optically coupled by preparing three multi-layer structures followed by cementing them together. Similarly, a multi- 

piece mixing element may be found disclosed in U. S. Patent No- 4,653,845 to Tremblav et al.Optical mixing elements having a rectangular body with a thickness approximately equal to that of an optical fiber have been suggested in U. S. Patent No. 4,449,783 to Witte. Such elements are reported to have relatively low insertion loss, but may in fact be as tedious to fabricate as the bundle- ype star coupler taught by Coutandin et al., See U. S. Patent No. 4,919,851.In International Publication No. WO 90/08030 there is disclosed a star coupler partially made by way of an injection molding process. In accordance with the '030 publication, a coupler is molded in the negative in the sense that channels are defined by way of a molded body, which channels are then filled with a suitable optically clear material. In use, the material filling the channel is operative as a waveguide core material and the injection molded body is intended to function as cladding.Despite substantial improvements in the field, known optical signal couplers tend to have unacceptably high losses, nonuniform signal distribution, or are inordinately difficult to fabricate.
