 PIPERAZINE AND PIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES, AND THEIR USE AS ANTIPSYCHOTICS■r The present invention relates to a group of piperazine and piperidine derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical ^* compositions containing them and to their use in therapy, in particular in the treatment of psychotic disorders.Receptors for the chemical messenger dopamine are known to be located in the striatum and the li bic brain area and such receptors have been classified as D. and D. based on receptor binding studies and on the presence or absence of a positive coupling between the receptor and adenylate cyclase activity. Activation of the D- -receptor is associated with stimulation of adenylate cyclase, whereas the D„-receptor mediates dopaminergic effects that do not involve direct stimulation of this enzyme (see Kebabian & Calne, Nature. 1979, 227. .93 and Harrold et al, J. Med. Chem.. 1987, 30, 1631). Although the distinct functions of the D.- and D.-receptors are not clear cut, a strong correlation is believed to exist between D„-receptor antagonism and antipsychotic activity (see Seeman, Pharmacol. Rev.. 1981, ,32, 229, Seeman et si, Biochem Pharmacol.. 1985, 2 . 151, Creese et al, Science. 1976, 192. 481 and Leysen in Clinical Pharmacology in Psychiatry: Neuroleptic and Antidepressant Research: Eds Usdin, Dahl, Gram and Lingjaerde, Mac illan: Basingstoke, 1982; pp35-52).The chemical messenger 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT) occurs widely in the central nervous system and is known to be involved in the control of behavior. A number of different 5-HT receptors and receptor sub-types have been identified. In addition to the blockade of D_-receptors, it has been postulated that 5-HT_ receptor antagonism is ' ~ also desirable in an antipsychotic agent (see Janssen et al, J. Pharm. and Exper. Ther.. 1988, 244(2). 685). In particular it has been- postulated that blockade of central dopamine D_-receptors may control1% the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. delusions and hallucinations) whilst blockade of 5-HT„ receptors may assist in the amelioration of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. apathy 

and social withdrawal) . It has also been suggested that blockade of the 5-HT„ receptor results in a reduction of the extrapyramidal side effects which are known to occur in the case of neuroleptic maintenance therapy with many known antipsychotic agents.Psychotropic benzisothiazoles and benzisoxazoles are described inUS4968792, EP0357134 and EP0196132.
