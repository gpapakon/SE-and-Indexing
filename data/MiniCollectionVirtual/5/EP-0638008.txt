<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for laser-welding superposed sheets of metal (3, 4) which are held together by a movable clamp (5). When the clamp (5) is closed, the feed distance is measured and, from this measurement, the thickness of the sheet-metal packet (3, 4) calculated and output. The welding power required is set as a function of the measured packet thickness. This can be done by an automatic control unit which sets the power supply (11) independently. The welding head (2) is designed as a laser focussing unit and can be integrated in the clamp (5) and moved with the clamp.
