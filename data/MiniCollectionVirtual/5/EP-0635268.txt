<ABSTRACT>
Wortmannin and certain of its analogs are 
inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The compounds 

are particularly useful for inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase in mammals and for treating phosphatidylinositol 

3-kinase-dependent conditions, especially neoplasms, in 
mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in a 
lysed or whole cell by contacting the lysed or whole cell with a 
compound known as wortmannin or one of certain wortmannin 
analogs. Such compounds also can be used to selectively inhibit 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in mammals, particularly humans, 
and to treat phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent conditions, 
particularly neoplasms, in humans. The metabolism of inositolphospholipids is believed to 
be an essential part of the receptor-mediated signal 
transduction pathways in response to various hormones and growth 
factors [see, e.g., Berridge, M.J., et al., Nature, 312: 315-321 
(1984); Nishizuka, Y., Science, 225: 1365-1370 (1984)]. In this signaling pathway, two intracellular second 
messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol are 
generated through the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate 
by phospholipase C. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
releases Ca²⁺ from intracellular Ca²⁺ stores leading to the 
activation of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase; diacylglycerol 
activates protein kinase  
 
C. Following breakdown, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
is rapidly resynthesized by stepwise phosphorylation of 
phosphatidylinositol by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and 
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinase. These 2 kinases appear 
to play important roles in the production of second messengers 
(see, e.g., Duell, T.F., US Pat. No. 5,001,064 (1991); 
Shibasaki, F., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266 (13): 8108-8114 
(1991). More recently, the existence of another 
phosphatidylinositol kinase has been identified and associated 
with certain activated tyrosine kinases [Courtneidge, S.A., etal., Cell, 50: 1031-1037 (1987); Kaplan, D.R., et al., Cell, 50: 
1021-1029 (1987)]. This kinase, identified as 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been found to phosphorylate 
the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 
to form phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI-3P) [Whitman, D., 
et al., Nature, 332: 664-646 (1988). In addition to PI, this enzyme also can phosphorylate 
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate 
and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP₃), 
respectively [Auger, K.R., et al., Cell, 57: 167-175 (1989)]. PI 3-kinase physically associates with tyrosine 
kinases such as pp60v-src, polyoma middle T/pp60c-src, platelet-derived 
growth factor receptor, colony
