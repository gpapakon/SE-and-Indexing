<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for body care provided 
with a handpiece (1), on one end of which a treatment means is 

provided, which 
can be driven by means of a motor connected to said handpiece, a line 

(7) for 
the supply of pressurized air being connected to an air channel (8) 

provided 
in said handpiece and a line (9) for supplying a liquid being connected 

to 
a liquid channel (13) provided in said handpiece, whereby said air 

channel and 
said liquid channel terminate near said treatment means, whereby a 

non-return 
valve (12) is provided near the connection of the liquid channel and 

the liquid supply line, which non-return valve (12) only allows liquid 
to flow 

in the direction of the treatment means, whilst an additional line for 
the supply of pressurized air is provided, which opens into the liquid 

channel just downstream of said non-return valve. The invention 
furthermore relates to a method of operating the above device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for body care provided 
with a handpiece, on one end of which a treatment means is provided, which 
can be driven by means of a motor connected to said handpiece, a line for 
the supply of pressurized air being connected to an air channel provided 
in said handpiece and a line for supplying a liquid being connected to 
a liquid channel provided in said handpiece, whereby said air channel and 
said liquid channel terminate near said treatment means. Devices of this type are for example used by dentists 
and/or pedicures, whereby the treatment means is for example a cutter, 
a polishing means or the like for treating the teeth and/or the skin. A fine mist or spray of liquid droplets, generally water 
droplets, is thereby formed near the treatment means by mixing the jet 
of liquid exiting from the liquid channel near the treatment means during 
operation with an air jet exiting from the air channel, which air jet 
intersects the exiting jet of liquid at an angle. The construction of known devices of this type is 
thereby such that when the drive of the treatment means is stopped, the 
supply of liquid and air is also interrupted automatically. A problem which 
occurs thereby is the fact that when the supply of pressurized liquid is 
interrupted, a certain amount of liquid is still present in the liquid 
channel extending through the device. As a result of this liquid will 
continue to drop for some time after the drive of the treatment means has 
been stopped, which not only is inconvenient, but which may also imply 
a risk of infection. In order to overcome this drawback it has been proposed 
to provide the device with a return suction valve, by means of which part 
of the liquid remaining behind in the liquid channel can be sucked back. 
When the treatment means is put into action again this sucked-back liquid 
is sprayed again. This constitutes a great risk of infection, however. The object of the invention is to obtain a device of 
the above kind, wherein the above-described drawbacks of the known devices 
can be avoided. According to the invention this may be achieved in that 
a non-return valve is provided near the connection of the liquid channel 
and the liquid supply line, which non-return valve only allows liquid to  
 
flow in the direction of the treatment means, whilst an additional line 
for the supply of pressurized air is provided, which opens into the liquid 
channel just downstream of said non-return valve. By using the construction according to the

<CLAIMS>
A device for body care provided with a handpiece, 
on one end of which a treatment means is provided, which can be driven 

by means of a motor connected to said handpiece, a line for the supply 
of pressurized air being connected to an air channel provided in said 

handpiece and a line for supplying a liquid being connected to a liquid 
channel provided in said handpiece, whereby said air channel and said 

liquid channel terminate near said treatment means, characterized in that 
a non-return valve is provided near the connection of the liquid channel 

and the liquid supply line, which non-return valve only allows liquid to 
flow in the direction of the treatment means, whilst an additional line 

for the supply of pressurized air is provided, which opens into the liquid 
channel just downstream of said non-return valve. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said non-return valve is provided near the motor within the device. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a valve is incorporated in said additional line for the supply 

of pressurized air, said valve shutting off said line during normal 
operation of the device and briefly releasing the passage through said 

additional line when the motor is being turned off. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that 
a valve is provided in the line for the supply of pressurized air being 

connected to the air channel that terminates near said treatment means, 

said valve releasing the passage through the air line in question when 
the device is put into operation and shutting off the air line in question 

after the motor has been turned off, at least substantially at the exact 
moment that the passage through said additional air line is shut off. 
A method of operating a device for body care provided 
with a handpiece, on one end of which a treatment means is provided, which 

can be driven by means of a motor connected to said handpiece, a line for 
the supply of pressurized air being connected to an air channel provided 

in said handpiece and a line for supplying a liquid being connected to 
a liquid channel provided in said handpiece, whereby said air channel and 

said liquid channel terminate near said treatment means, characterized 
in that during operation the liquid is supplied via a non-return valve 

provided near the connection of the liquid channel and the liquid supply 
 

line, which non-return valve only allows liquid to flow in the direction 
of said treatment means, and that the supply of liquid is interrupted when 

the device is being stopped and pressurized air is supplied into said 
liquid channel via an additional line just downstream of said non-return 

valve.
