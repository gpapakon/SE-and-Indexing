<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism for driving the hands (10, 11) comprises, for each hand, a motive rotor (5, 6) driving an intermediate runner (3, 4), the latter in turn driving a centre runner (1, 2). At least, the intermediate runners (3, 4) are identical and interchangeable and are mounted head-to-tail between a plate (7) and a wheelwork bridge (8).

Mechanism for driving the hands of a timepiece
comprising, arranged between a bottom plate (7) and bridge

(8), a first rotor-motor (6) driving a plate (15) of a
first intermediate wheel carrying a pinion (16) driving a

first centre wheel (2), this latter comprising a plate
(17) meshing with said pinion (16) and a pipe (18) upon

which is pressed a hand (11) displaying a first unit of
time, and a second rotor-motor (5) driving a plate (18) of

a second intermediate wheel (3), said second intermediate
wheel carrying a pinion (19) driving a second centre wheel

(1), coaxial to the first, said second centre wheel
comprising a plate (20) meshing with said pinion (19) and

a shaft (21) passing through the pipe (18), a hand (10)
displaying a second unit of time being pressed onto said

shaft, characterised in that the first and second
intermediate wheels (4, 3) are identical and

interchangeable and in that they are arranged head to tail
between the bottom plate (7) and the bridge (8).
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in
that the first and second rotor-motors (6, 5) are

identical and interchangeable.
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in
that the plates (17, 20) of the first and second centre

wheels (2, 1) are made in an identical manner insofar as
concerns both the diameter and number of teeth, and the

central bore (23, 24) which they exhibit.
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in
that the plates (15, 18) of the first and second

intermediate wheels (4, 3) are arranged in a median plane 
(22) situated at equal distances between the bottom plate

(7) and the bridge (8).
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in
that the first and second rotor-motors (6, 5) form part of

a sole single stator motor (12) fitted with a single coil
(25).
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in
that the first and second rotor-motors (6, 5) each form

part of an independent motor fitted with a stator and a
coil.
Mechanism according to claim 4, characterised in
that the plates (17, 20) of the first and second centre

wheels (2, 1) are situated on either side of the median
plane (22) and at equal distances from the latter, so that

said wheels may be used as wished with the hands (11, 10)
situated on the bottom plate (7) or on the bridge (8).
Mechanism according to claim 7, characterised in
that the end (26) of the shaft (21) not carrying a hand is

mounted so as to rotate in a through bearing (9) driven
into the bottom plate (7) or into the bridge (8) and in

that said pipe (8) passing through the bridge (8) or
bottom plate (7) respectively is fitted so as to rotate in

one of said bottom plate or bridge, the external diameter
(27) of said bearing (9) being substantially equal to the

external diameter (28) of said pipe where it passes
through the bridge (8) or the bottom plate (7).
Chronograph watch fitted with a mechanism
according to claim 1 or 2, comprising two hands (11, 10)

capable of displaying, in response to the actuation of a
control device, either the time of day indicating the hour

and minute, or a measured time indicating the minute and
the second.
