<ABSTRACT>
Wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for a vehicle wheel. The wheel hub (6) has a region (a) of closely spaced V-shaped ridges (10) and troughs (11). The brake disc (8) has a central hole with corresponding V-shaped troughs (13) and ridges (14) for non-rotational locking of the disc to the hub.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel hub and brake disc 
arrangement for a vehicle wheel according to the preamble of 
claim 1. Brake discs for disc brakes have previously predominantly been 
attached to their hubs in either of two ways, namely either by 
being manufactured as an integral part of the hub or by being 
securely screwed to a circular flange on the hub. The former 
method is essentially restricted to brakes for lighter 
vehicles, whilst the latter is also suitable for medium-sized 
trucks, for example trucks up to 16 tonnes in weight. For the 
heaviest class of truck, drum brakes have until now been almost 
exclusively used due i.a. to the extremely high braking torque 
(around 2000 kpm) in combination with the brake shoes which 
apply the braking effect creating problems. More specifically, 
these problems are due to, on the one hand, the intense heating 
up of the brake disc as a result of the high braking force 
causing the disc to warp or upset because of its rigid 
attachment to the hub to thereby affect its alignment with the 
brake caliper and, on the other hand, the force applied to the 
disc causing warping of the stub axle assembly, which also 
affects the alignment of the brake disc with respect to the 
brake caliper. Both of these factors contribute to large 
stresses in the disc and wear to both the disc and brake pads. 
With conventional attachment of the brake disc to a wheel axle, 
it is possible that with heavier vehicles the deformation of 
the wheel axle which can arise during cornering can result in 
such misalignment between the disc and brake caliper that wear 
occurs. A wheel hub and brake disc arrangement which at least partially 
addresses some of the above-mentioned negative effects of a 
rigid attachment between the brake disc and the hub when 
subjected to intense heating, has previously been proposed for 
e.g. use in competition, i.e. for light vehicles. An 
arrangement of this type is shown and described in DE-OS 1 800 
161 in which a three or four cornered transmission ring is  
 
attached to the hub, with the corners engaging in corresponding 
recesses in the central hole of the brake disc. In addition to 
the advantage that, during heating, the disc can expand 
radially without warping, the arrangement also allows the disc 
to be quickly replaced, a not insignificant advantage for 
competition use. DE-A-29 19 128 discloses a wheel axle and brake disc 
arrangement for trailers and the like, wherein the axle and the 
periphery of a hole in the brake disc

<CLAIMS>
Wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for a vehicle 
wheel, comprising a carrier (6) presenting an outwardly 

facing region in the form of closely spaced V-shaped ridges 
(10) and troughs (11), and a brake disc (8) which is carried 

by said region of the carrier, said brake disc having a 
central hole, the edge of which is formed with correspondeing 

ridges (14) and troughs (13) to thereby provide a mutually 
non-rotational attachment of the brake disc to the carrier 

while providing an axial slip fit between the carrier and the 
disc, 
characterized in
 that the carrier is a wheel hub (6) 
rotatably journalled on a shaft portion (5) and that the 

depth of the troughs (11,13) is somewhat greater than the 
height of the ridges (10,14) so as to ensure surface contact 

over the entire flank surface (17) of the ridges. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that 
the lead angle (β) of the flanks of the ridges (10, 14) lies 

between 40° and 65°. 
Arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that 
the lead angle (β) of the flanks of the ridges (10, 14) is 

approximately 52°. 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in
 that uniformally spaced axial bores (18, 21) 
are provided around the central hole of the disc radially 

externally of at least certain troughs (13) in the disc and 
communicate with the base of respective adjacent troughs via 

slots (19) in the disc. 
Arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that 
an axial bore (18, 21) is provided in the disc radially 

inside of each trough (13) and in that certain uniformally 
spaced bores (18) communicate with an adjacent trough (13).  

 
Arrangement according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in
 
that at least certain of said axial bores communicate with 

ventilation passages (20) in the disc. 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in
 that, on at least one side, the disc 
cooperates with an axially resilient element (26) carried by 

the hub, which element permits restricted axial movement of 
the disc relative to the hub. 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized in
 that the disc is symmetric. 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 

characterized in
 that a circular channel (23), open on one 
side of the hub, is provided in the hub (6) radially inside 

of the region provided with ridges and troughs.
