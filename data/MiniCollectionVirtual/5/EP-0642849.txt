<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of highly dewatered, possibly contaminated sediments and/or possibly contaminated fine sediments (silt) separated off therefrom, in the form of constructional units for underwater filling-in of water bodies to be drained, in particular harbour basins. The constructional elements produced according to the invention comprise a highly compressed, highly dewatered, homogeneous shaped body of possibly contaminated sediments and/or possibly contaminated fine sediments separated off therefrom which is enclosed on all sides by a deformable water-permeable packaging casing. The constructional elements may be transported and sunk in the water without releasing pollutants. After they have been laid in the water bodies to be drained or filled in, the constructional elements, under load deformation, form a monolithic whole having relatively high strength in which the pollutants are incorporated so as to be immobile. With proper installation, the creation of buidling land from water bodies to be drained (land reclamation) is ensured with simultaneous environmentally compatible land filling of the possibly contaminated sediment or the possibly contaminated fine sediment separated off therefrom.

Use of by pressing extensively drained, if necessary
contaminated sediments and/or if necessary contaminated

fine segments or silt separated therefrom in the form of
constructive members, which comprise compressed moulded

bodies, surrounded by a packaging wrapping, for submarine
filling of bodies of water to be dried out, particularly

harbour basins.
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that
sedimented industrial and slurry muds, or mixtures

thereof are used as sediment deposits in natural or
artificial bodies of water.
Use according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that there is used as sediment excavator material from

harbours and/or rivers and/or the fine sediment separated
therefrom or the harbour or river silt.
Constructive member according to claims 1 to 3, for
submarine filling of bodies of water to be dried out,

particularly harbour basins, characterised in that it
comprises an by pressing intensely condensed to a large degree

drained, homogeneous moulded body (7) made of if
necessary contaminated sediment or fine sediments if 

necessary contaminated, separated therefrom, which is
surrounded on all sides with a deformable water-permeable

packaging wrapping.
Constructive member according to claim 4,
characterised in that the packaging wrapping comprises a

textile, preferably a nonwoven material.
Constructive member according to claim 4,
characterised in that the packaging wrapping is a

contaminant filter, which comprises a needled, stitched
and/or stitch-bonded nonwoven/nonwoven composite or a

textile/nonwoven composite, in which there are
incorporated between the two textile layers one or a

plurality of materials absorbing and adsorbing
contaminants.
Constructive member according to claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that cavities or the interspaces between

the fibres of the textile layers are entirely or partly
filled with sediments, silt, mineral clay or materials

absorbing and/or adsorbing contaminants.
Constructive member according to claim 7,
characterised in that the entirely or partly filled

textile layers are kept moist or are sealed over the 
entire surface with a water-soluble adhesive on the side

coming to lie outwards, or on both sides.
Constructive member according to claims 4 to 8,
characterised in that the packaging wrapping surrounds

the moulded body (7) conforming closely thereto.
Constructive member according to claims 4 to 9,
characterised in that the moulded body (7) comprises

contaminated excavated material and/or contaminated silt
separated therefrom.
Constructive member according to claims 4 to 10,
characterised in that it has the shape of a cylinder,

preferably with a diameter of 1.25 m and a length of 5 m.
Method of manufacturing the constructive members
according to claims 4 to 11, charcterised in that a sediment

and/or a fine sediment cake obtained by pressing is pressed,
preferably with further water removal, to form a moulded

body (7) and the moulded body (7) obtained is surrounded
on all sides by a deformable, water-permeable packaging

wrapping.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that
the pressing of the cake is effected by means of a piston 

press or another hydraulically operating large-scale
press.
Method according to claim 12 and 13, characterised
in that the moulded body (7) is pressed directly into the

packaging wrapping.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that
the packaging wrapping is produced by spiral winding with

an endless nonwoven strip and subsequent capping of the
ends of the moulded body (7) .
Method according to claims 12 to 15, characterised
in that the packaging wrapping surrounding the moulded

body (7) is subjected to a thermal shrinkage process.
Device for carrying out the method according to
claims 12 to 16, characterised in that it presents a

piston press provided with a packaging wrapping device,
and the compression cylinder (3) of which is connected on

the one hand to a filling hopper (2) for the sediment or
fine sediment cake, and on the other hand is provided

with a tapering section (4), the tapering section (4)
being connected to a shaping tube (4a).
Device according to claim 17, characterised in that
the tapering section (4) is conical in shape. 
Device according to claim 17 and/or 18,
characterised in that the tapering section (4) is

provided for devices for emergence of the expelled water.
