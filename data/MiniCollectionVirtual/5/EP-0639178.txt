<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a novel genus of diaryl 
compounds, with processes for their preparation, with medicaments 
containing them and with their use as therapeutic agents, particularly 
in the prophylaxis and treatment of atherosclerosis. The enzyme acyl coenzyme A - cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) is 
known to be involved in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and 
in the accumulation of cholesterol as cholesterol esters in the 
arterial wall. Thus compounds which inhibit ACAT have the potential 
of demonstrating both potent hypocholesterolaemic activity and a 
decrease in arterial cholesterol deposition. A group of compounds known collectively as 'fibrates' which give rise 
to a modest decrease in LDL-cholesterol, a significant decrease in 
triglycerides and a marked elevation of HDL-cholesterol in the plasma 
have been found useful in the treatment of Type IIA, IIB, III, IV and 
V hyperlipidaemias. The increase in the level of HDL-cholesterol is 
particularly important since it facilitates the removal of free 
cholesterol from the arterial wall for return to the liver ('reverse 
cholesterol transport'). It follows that a drug combining the hypocholesterolaemic/anti-atherosclerotic 
properties of an ACAT inhibitor with hypolipidaemic/HDL-enhancing 
properties would be particularly useful in the prophylaxis 
and treatment of atherosclerosis, the enhanced HDL-cholesterol level 
induced giving rise to an increase in the capacity of the reverse 
cholesterol transport mechanism to remove the free cholesterol 
resulting from ACAT inhibition in the arterial wall. Such a drug 
would be especially beneficial to Type IIA and Type III patients 
having both high serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels who are at 
particular risk of contracting coronary heart disease. US-A-4623662 relates to urea and 
thiourea compounds, and their use in the treatment 
of atherosclerosis.  
 On the basis of the foregoing, we have disovered a series of novel 
compounds having potential hypolipidaemic/hypocholesterolaemic 
activity. According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a 
compound of formula (I) 
 
wherein 
Ar isa mono- or bicyclic aromatic group optionally containing one or 
two heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and 
sulphur, said group being optionally substituted by one or more 
atoms or groups independently selected from halogen, nitro, 
amino, -NRR1 where R and R1 are independently selected from 
hydrogen, C1-8 alkyl and C1-8 alkanoyl, cyano,
