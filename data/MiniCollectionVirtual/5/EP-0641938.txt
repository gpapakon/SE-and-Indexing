<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
high-temperature gas blower impeller, a gas blower device
equipped with such impeller, and a high-temperature gas
circulating furnace equipped with such gas blower device,
and more particularly to a technique relating to
improvements in the material of vanes or blades of the
impeller.An blower or fan is used to blow a gas of a
relatively high temperature in various industrial furnaces
such as heat treating and heating furnaces. Such a
high-temperature blower is utilized, for example, to stir or
circulate a high-temperature atmosphere or gas of around
800°C within a furnace. Since the blower is used in such
severe thermal environment, a rotating impeller of the
blower is usually made of a heat-resistant steel capable of
withstanding a reaction force and a centrifugal force which
are produced during an operation of the blower to circulate
the atmosphere. However, the upper limit of the operating
temperature of the impeller made of a heat-resistant steel
is about 850°C, above which the impeller does not have a
sufficient strength. Also, the strength of the impeller
limits the operating speed of the impeller to 1000 r.p.m. or
so. To obtain a desired capacity or gas quantity, therefore,
the gas blower device must be relatively large-sized.
Whereas, it is desired to minimize the size of the gas
blower device, particularly where the device is built in a
furnace, such as a gas circulating furnace adapted to
circulate a high-temperature gas within a heating chamber.
In this case, an increase in the size of the blower device
will undesirably lead to an accordingly large size of the
furnace body.US-A-4,029,477 discloses a coated NiCr dispersion modified alloy,
consisting of a metal base including 15 to 30 % by weight
of Cr, 0,1 to 10 % by weight of oxides selected from rare earth
element oxides, up to 1 % by weight of elements selected from Ti
and Al with the balance essentially being Ni and impurities. In
this base alloy 0,1 to 10 % by weight of oxides of the rare
earth elements, preferably oxides selected from those of Th, Y,
La are dispersed.US-A-4,371,312 discloses a bucket formed of an alloy material
comprising a conventional dispersion-strengthened Fe-Cr-Al alloy
containing about 64,5 to 75,5 % by weight of Fe, 15 to 25 % by
weight of Cr, 3 to 8 % by weight of Al, 0,1 to 1 % by weight of
Ti, 0 to 3 % by weight of Co, 0 to 1 % by weight of Y or Ce as
well as 0,1 to 1,5 % by weight of yttrium oxide or aluminum
oxide.However, further improvements regarding oxidation
