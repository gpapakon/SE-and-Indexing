<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of digesting recycled paper at a concentration between 8 and 15 % in a closed container, supplying gas or steam at an overpressure between 0.2 and 4 bar and at temperatures between 90 and 150  DEG C and subsequently diluting to a concentration between 3 and 5 % and separating the usable material from the unusable by mixing in a rotating perforated-sheet drum - preferably with a horizontal axis - into one end of which the digested recycled-paper suspension is blown.
