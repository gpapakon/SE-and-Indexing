<ABSTRACT>
A sintering process is described using a glass-ceramic slurry 
containing an alloy powder or flakes selected from a group of 

alloys consisting of: 

Fe-Cr
Cu-Ti 
Fe-Cr-Ni
Ag-Ti 
Cr-Al
Nb-Al 
Ni-Cr
Cu-Al 
Ni-Al
Cu-Al-Cr 
Fe-Al
The slurry is molded and later is sintered in a steam 
atmosphere at a temperature of about 1000°C to yield a glass-ceramic 

substrate toughened against crack propagation and 
useful in the packaging of semi-conductor device chips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the fabrication of 
glass ceramic substrates for the packaging of semiconductor 
device chips and, more particularly, to the toughening of the 
brittle glass-ceramic substrates in a manner compatible with 
existing substrate processing cycles including high 
temperature sintering in the presence of oxygenating 
ambients. As is well understood, the toughness of a ceramic is a 
material property which is a measure of the resistance 
against crack propagation when the ceramic is stressed. 
Glass ceramics, particularly based on cordierite, are not as 
tough as other structural ceramics such as alumina, silicon 
nitride, silicon carbide, zirconia, etc. It is desirable to 
enhance glass-ceramic toughness for certain applications and 
techniques have been proposed to achieve that end. It is 
known, for example, that fibers of metallic glass ribbon 
reinforcement of glass ceramic matrix provide improvement in 
the fracture toughness of the glass-ceramic matrices formed 
by heat treatment of the composites. This is described in 
papers by R. U. Vaidya and K. N. Subramanian, "Reinforced 
Glass-Ceramic Matrix Composites", Journal of Materials 
Science, 25 (1990), pp. 3291-3296 and "Elevated Temperature 
Mechanical Properties of Continuous Metallic Glass Ribbon-Reinforced 
Glass-Ceramic Matrix Composites", Journal of 
Materials Science, 26 (1991) pp. 1391-1394. The described 
toughening techniques reportedly include laying out the 
metallic glass ribbons within glass powders in a steel die, 
pressing the composite specimens at 3000 p.s.i., heating to 
200°C to drive out organic binder and then sintering and 
devitrifying at 400°C and 450°C, respectively. The problem 
of the toughening of glass ceramic substrates subjected to  
 
more rigorous high temperature (up to 1000°C) sintering in 
steam was not addressed. Brownlow, et al., U.S-A-4,474,731, discloses the steam 
sintering of ceramic materials containing conductive pathways 
suitable for the packaging of semiconductor device chips. 
This patent teaches a steam sintering cycle for glass-ceramic 
in which nickel or palladium is added to the glass-ceramic 
green sheets as catalysts for carbon removal by oxidation. 
NiO and Pd (NO₃)₂ were used as the catalytic agents. 
Material properties of the sintered ceramic, such as 
toughness and strength are not discussed. One object of the present invention is to provide a 
toughened glass ceramic and glass plus ceramic substrates 
utilizing a slurry compatible with state-of-the-art 
semico
