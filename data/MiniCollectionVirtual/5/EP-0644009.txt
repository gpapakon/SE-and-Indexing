<ABSTRACT>
A method of finishing the tooth flanks of gear-shaped workpieces using an abrasive tool in the shape of an internal gear is presented in which the tool is dressed with a dressing wheel in the same set-up after each workpiece or after several workpieces. The tooth system of the dressing wheel corresponds to that of the gear-shaped workpieces and its tooth flanks are covered with extremely hard abrasive grains. To improve the tool geometry, the dressing of the tool in the shape of an internal gear is to be effected with single- or double-flank contact between the dressing wheel and the tool in the shape of an internal gear and with electronic positive guidance of the rolling and relative movements between the dressing wheel and the tool in the shape of an internal gear, and the finishing is to be effected in the free or instantaneously guided double-flank engagement between the tool in the shape of an internal gear and the workpiece.

A method of finishing the tooth flanks of gear-type workpieces using an
abrasive, internally toothed tool which, after each workpiece or after a

plurality of workpieces, is dressed in the same mounting using a dressing
wheel, the toothing of which corresponds to that of the gear-type

workpieces, and the tooth flanks of which are coated with extremely
hard abrasive grains, wherein finishing is carried out with free or load-controlled

dual-flank engagement between the internally toothed tool
and the workpiece, characterised in that dressing of the internally

toothed tool takes place with single- or dual-flank contact between the
dressing wheel and the internally toothed tool and with electronic

positive control of the rolling and relative movements between the
dressing wheel and the internally toothed tool, and in that, during

dressing, an additional rotation is superimposed on the rotatory part of

the positively controlled rolling movement in such a manner that the
dressing wheel generates a predetermined helix angle on the tool in the

contact zones between the tooth flanks of the tool and the dressing
wheel.
