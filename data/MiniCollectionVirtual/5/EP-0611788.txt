<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a powdery and granular polymer having a sharp
particle size distribution and a high bulk specific
gravity.Hitherto, various investigations have been made
on a method for improving the powder characteristics of a
powdery and granular polymer obtained in recovering the
polymer from a polymer latex. For example, United States
Patent No. 4,897,462 discloses a method of coagulating a
graft copolymer latex containing many elastic backbone
polymers at the particular concentration of a coagulating
agent. Also, a method of adding a coagulating agent in
two or more steps, and a method of adding a hard resin,
inorganic compound, etc. for modification to the resulting
coagulated particle are disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Kokai No. 59-91103 and United States Patent
No. 4,275,178.In the method of coagulating at the particular
concentration of a coagulating agent, there is a case
where the coagulation does not occur at all depending
upon the kind and amount of a surface active agent
present in the latex, or a case where a powdery and 
granular polymer having improved powder characteristics
is not obtained even if the coagulation is carried out so
that the uncoagulated latex remains in only few amounts.
Therefore, an acid or salt is added in large amounts in
order to bring the coagulation to completion. This
method, however, has a defect that it exerts adverse
effects on the thermal stability of the powder as an
article, and therefore that in order to solve the adverse
effects, the coagulated slurry needs to be neutralized
with an alkaline substance before solidification, which
makes the coagulation process complicated.The method of adding a coagulating agent in two
or more steps has a defect that, when this method is used
to coagulate the latex containing only a surface active
agent unstable to acids, it locally brings the coagulation
to completion even if the amount of the coagulated
polymer and pH are controlled, because of which a good
powdery and granular polymer is not obtained. Further,
when the temperature is raised too high in a second
coagulation vessel and vessels subsequent thereto, the
coagulated particles are undesirably likely to aggregate.Also, the method of modifying the surface of
the coagulated particle by adding a hard resin or
inorganic compound in order to raise the bulk specific
gravity of the resulting powdery and granular polymer,
intends to make dense the packing structure of the
particle group, thereby raising the bulk
