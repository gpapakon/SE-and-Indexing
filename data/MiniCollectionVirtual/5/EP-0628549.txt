<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new 1-phenylmethylbenzimidazole
piperazine derivatives, a process for
preparing the same and their addition salts with
pharmaceutically acceptable acids. In particular, new
compounds of formula (I)

are described wherein R1
can be a halogen atom, a short chain alkyl group, nitro and
hydroxy,
and R2 can be a hydrogen atom,
a halogen atom, a short chain alkyl group, a nitro group,
and a hydroxy group. The short chain refers to a 1 to 3
carbon atom radical, linear or branched, the halogen
atoms can be Cl, Br, F or I. This invention similarly
comprises the addition salts of these compounds with
inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic,
phosphoric and sulphuric acids, and organic acids such as
acetic, fumaric, tartaric, oxalic and benzoic acids.Certain benzimidazole derivatives containing
piperazine at position 2 in the benzimidazole are known
which structurally resemble the compounds of the present
invention. Thus, US Patent 4,093,726 describes compounds
of formula (A) with hypotensive activity:

wherein R is an H atom or a methyl group; R' is an alkyl
group, an acyl group, an aryl group, an alkoxy carbonyl
group, a tetrahydrofuroyl group, a dialkyl aminocarbonyl 
group or a furoyl group; R'' is a hydrogen atom or a
methoxy group. Similarly, patent EP 0,079,545 describes
benzimidazole piperazines with antihistaminic activity of
general formula (B)

wherein R'' is hydrogen or a short chain alkyl group and
R' is a short chain alkyl group, an allyl group, a
propargyl group or a phenyl group.Though structurally akin, the foregoing compounds
differ from the compounds of the present invention in
that the substituent at N 1 in benzimidazole is the
phenylmethyl group in all cases. The compounds of the
present invention are moreover always free
piperazines, viz. piperazine is never substituted other
than by a hydrogen atom at position 4. Both of these
facts are very significant from the standpoint of 5HT3
antagonist activity of the new derivatives described in
the present invention. The document EP-A 0 512 939 discloses 1-phenylmethyl 2-piperazinyl benzimidazol
derivatives having the above formula (I), wherein the R1 and R2 substituents are simultaneously
hydrogen, i. e. wherein the phenylene residue bears no substituent. The process for preparing the said compounds
basically comprises reacting a halogenated derivative of
general formula (II)

wherein R1
can be a halogen atom, a short chain alkyl group, nitro and hydroxy,
and R2 can be hydrogen, a short chain alkyl
group, a
