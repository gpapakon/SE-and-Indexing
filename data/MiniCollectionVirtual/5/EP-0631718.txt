<ABSTRACT>
A hand tool (10) having a pair of elongated 
members (12, 14) spring-biased to an open position also 

includes a resilient lock (68) functioning to secure 
members (12, 14) in closed position. The lock (68) 

comprises a button (70) having a resilient head (72) and 
a shank (74) projecting from head (72) and connected to a 

resilient cap (78) by a fastener (82). Head (72) and cap 
(78) have respective concavely-shaped faces (76, 80) 

which are effectively in contact with tool (10) along 
annular regions (79, 85).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tools of the type 
which are resiliently biased to an open position, and 
that have a locking mechanism to keep these tools in a 
closed configuration. Hand-held garden tools such as pruning shears 
of the pass-by or anvil-type, wire snips, pliers, and 
certain other cutting implements such as scissors include 
a spring mechanism for urging the handles in the "open" 
position. These implements also usually include a lock 
mechanism functioning against the action of the spring to 
maintain the blades in closed position. Conventional locks for hand-held cutters 
include a pivoting member secured to one of the cutting 
jaws, pivotable into abutting relationship with the 
opposing jaw. Other devices employ a pivoting ratchet 
mechanism which can be moved from a locked to an unlocked 
position by the user's thumb. Examples of such locks for 
pruning implements are described in U.S. Patents No. 
4,156,311, issued on May 29, 1979 to Wallace, et al.; No. 
4,268,963, issued on May 26, 1981 to Harrison; and No. 
4,341,016, issued July 27, 1982 to Harrison, et al. As 
more particularly disclosed in these patents, the locking 
mechanism comprises a pin slidably positioned in a slot 
formed in one of the pivoted members to engage a recess 
or protrusion formed in the other member.  
 Other locking mechanisms comprise a spring 
biased stationary pin extending into a mating cavity when 
the tool is in closed configuration. Examples of such 
locking means are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 3,357,287 
issued on December 12, 1967 to Wertepny, and No. 
4,947,553 issued on August 14, 1990 to Bendickson et al. These conventional latching mechanisms have 
various limitations. For example, certain locking 
mechanisms of the slidable type do not readily retain 
their positional adjustment. The slidable pin tends to 
slide away from its selected position during normal 
operation of the implement and may impair normal 
operation of the tool. Other conventional mechanisms 
which are more reliable are of rather complex 
construction necessitating several parts, thereby 
increasing the cost of the tool, and possibly rendering 
these tools less durable. Thus, it is desirable to provide an inexpensive 
lock mechanism for items such as pruning shears or the 
like which can alleviate the problems associated with 
conventional latch mechanisms, i.e., which has improved 
positional retention properties, and which requires only 
a limited number of components of simple configuration to 
facilitate manufacturing

<CLAIMS>
A hand tool (10) comprising:
 
   first and second working pieces (32, 34) 

disposed for cooperative engagement about a pivot point 
(16);
 
   first and second members (12, 14) secured to a 

respective one of the working pieces (32, 34) and 
resiliently biased to an open position, the members (12, 

14) having respective first and second slots (86, 88) 
formed therethrough and being substantially in 

registration when the working pieces (32, 34) are in 
closed position; and
 
   a resilient lock (68) slidable within the slots 

(86, 88) for securing the working pieces (32, 34) in the 
closed position;
 
   characterized in that the lock (68) includes a 

button (70) having a yieldable head (72) merging into a 
shank (74) extending through the slots (86, 88), the lock 

(68) further including a cap (78) joined to the button 
(70) by the shank (74),
 
   and in that the head (72) and the cap (78) each 

have a face (76, 80) concavely shaped so that the head 
(72) and the cap (78) are effectively in contact with the 

tool (10) in a respective annular region (79, 85) of each 
of the faces (76, 80), and further in that the area of 

the regions is proportional to the degree of compressive 
force applied to the lock (68), thereby determining the 

degree of frictional, locking, engagement of the faces 
(76, 80) with the tool (10). 
The tool of claim 1 further characterized 
in that the shank (74) has a bore (83), and the lock (68) 

further comprises a fastener (82) engaging the bore (83) 
to permit adjustment of the degree of frictional, 

locking, engagement of the faces (76, 80) with the tool 
(10).  

 
The tool of claim 1 further characterized 
in that the head (72) comprises a central driver-engageable 

recess (77) suitably formed for engagement by 
a driver tool. 
The tool of claim 1 further characterized 
in that the face (80) of the cap (78) has a centering 

recess (84) matingly engaging the free end of the shank 
(74). 
The tool of claim 1 further characterized 
in that the head (72) of the button (70) and the cap (78) 

are substantially identically shaped thereby rendering 
the lock (68) ambidextrous. 
The tool of claim 1 further characterized 
in that the head (72) and the cap (78) are substantially 

circular thereby rendering the lock (68) non-directional. 
The tool of claim 1 further characterized 
in that the button (70) and the cap (78) are made out of 

nylon. 
The tool of claim 2 further characterized 
in that the pivot point (16) has the same design as lock (68) and 

is comprised of a button 
(70), a cap (78), and a fastener (82). 
The tool of claim 1 wherein the first slot 
(86) is an elongated slot formed in spaced relationship 

to the pivot (16) and substantially parallel to the 
longitudinal axis of the tool (10), and the second slot 

(88) is substantially L-shaped, the lower portion of the 
L-shaped slot (88) being substantially parallel to the 

axis when the tool (10) is in closed position. 
A resilient lock (68) for securing 
together a pair of cooperatively-engaging pivoted  

 
elongated members (12, 14) having outer surfaces (28, 

30), the lock (68) characterized in that it comprises: 

(a) a resilient button (70) having a head 
(72), disposed adjacent the outer surface (28) of one of 

the members (12), and a shank (74) projecting from the 
head (72) and extending through a pair of lock-receiving 

slots (86, 88) formed in a respective one of the members 
(12, 14) in spaced relationship to the pivotal area, the 

shank (74) further including a bore (83), the head (72) 
having a face (76), the face (76) being concavely shaped 

so that the head (72) is effectively in contact with the 
outer surface (28) in an annular region (79) of the face 

(76); and 
(b) a yieldable cap (78) having a concavely 
shaped face (80) so that the cap (78) is effectively in 

contact with the outer surface (30) of the other of the 
members (14) in an annular region (85) of the cap face 

(80), the cap (78) being compressively joined to the 
button (70) by a fastener (82) engaging the bore (83) to 

permit adjustment of the compressive force applied to the 
lock (68) and thereby determine the degree of frictional, 

locking, engagement of the faces (76, 80) with the outer 
surfaces (28, 30).
