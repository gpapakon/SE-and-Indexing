<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical communication system. It is well known to use, for example, an infra-red source to pass 
information, for example, a television remote control apparatus, or an infra-red 
transmission system in a theatre for transmitting signals to a handset receiver for 
use, for example, by people with impaired hearing. Optical free-space transmission 
is the new alternative to radio and microwave communications for future mobile 
computer networks. It is capable of offering far greater bandwidth and, where it is 
used inside rooms where it is used, it does not interfere with other systems. 
These new infra-red communications systems could be based on very low-cost 
consumer opto-electronic components such as 850nm sources and silicon 
detectors. The projected cost of optical free-space wireless systems is therefore 
much lower than microwave-based systems. Low cost is fundamental to mass 
exploitation of communication systems for use with mobile computers. European 
patent application EP-A-0398181 discloses a device which is used to transmit an 
optical signal to terminal equipment in a domestic environment. The device is set 
at the end of an optical fibre cable and couples the optical signal from the cable, 
scattering the light throughout a room. The scattering element may be a lens or a 
short length of optical fibre having high scatter loses. The terminal equipment 
includes a receiver for the scattered light. There are, however, several problems with such systems. Firstly they 
require power to be provided to the transmitter itself, and secondly, in some 
circumstances, it may be possible by the use of a lens, for example a binocular 
lens, (the diameter of the lens is defined in the standard to be 50mm) to focus the 
infra-red radiation from the transmitter onto the skin, or worse still, the retina and 
to possibly damage the skin or retina. An important factor is the size of the optical source - the lens of the eye 
may focus the light from a point source to a small intense spot on the retina, 
whilst the same optical  
 
energy from a large area source will give a much larger 
spot on the retina and will thus result in less of a 
hazard. Various national and international standards on the safety 
of lasers (such as IEC825 [2]) specify what optical 
emission levels from lasers should be considered as safe. 
In these standards, products are classified according to 
the hazard, with class 1 being defined as inherently safe 
(even when viewed with optical instruments such
