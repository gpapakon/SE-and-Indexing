 TΓΓLEMethod for Removing Olefinic Impurities from HydrochlorofluorocarbonsFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to purifying a hydrochlorofluorocarbon which contains an olefinic impurity.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are widely used as solvents, cleaning agents, blowing agents, and refrigerants. It is desirable that the hydrochloro¬ fluorocarbon which is selected for such uses possess stability and freedom from toxic impurities. Olefinic impurities which are often present as impurities in the hydrochlorofluorocarbon may be toxic and/or unstable. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons have been produced by methods such as the chlorination of fluorohydrocarbons, fluorination of hydrochlorocarbons, exchange reactions between hydrogen fluoride and hydrochlorocarbons, or the addition of chlorine, fluorine, hydrogen chloride, or hydrogen fluoride to halogenated olefins. In several of these known methods, the resultant hydrochloro¬ fluorocarbon typically contains at least traces of olefinic impurities even after fractional distillation.Known methods for purifying hydrofluorocarbons containing olefinic impurities include reaction with aqueous potassium permanganate, amines, oxygen, sulfuric acid, or hydrogen fluoride. Each of these methods has significant disadvantages for hydrofluorocarbon purification such as requiring extensive operations, producing undesirable residues, and/or destroying undesirable amounts of the compound to be purified. These methods are at least as disadvantageous for purifying hydrochlorofluorocarbons because hydrochlorofluorocarbons are generally more subject to undesirable side reactions.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for treating an impure mixture containing at least one hydrochlorofluorocarbon and at least one olefinic impurity by contacting the mixture with a source of hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. During such contacting the olefinic impurity is converted to a hydrogenated form which is saturated. The treated mixture contains the hydrogenated form of the impurity, the original hydrochlorofluorocarbon(s), and 

 optionally a hydrofluorocarbon which may be the hydrodechlorinated product of the original hydrochlorofluorocarbon. The hydrogenated form of the olefin is usually more stable and relatively non-toxic. The hydrogenated form of the olefin, which is now saturated, is generally a more acceptable impurity and the presence thereof may be permissible for certain end-use applications. However, if
