<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
2-formyl-1,4-butanediol by hydroformylating 2-butene-1,4-diol 
by reaction with hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the 
presence of a catalyst. 2-Formyl-1,4-butanediol can be 
introduced, upon hydrogenation, into 2-methylol-1,4-butanediol, 
which is valuable as a starting material for 
polymers such as polyesters, as well as medicines, and, upon 
oxidation, into 2-carboxy-1,4-butanediol, which is useful as 
a starting material for polymers such as polyurethanes. Reaction of olefinically unsaturated organic compounds 
with hydrogen and carbon monoxide to obtain aldehydes, 
called hydroformylation or oxo-reaction, is known as an 
industrially valuable synthesis process. For this reaction, 
catalysts of cobalt compounds or rhodium compounds are 
generally used. In particular, rhodium compounds are well 
known as being superior to cobalt compounds in the catalytic 
activity for hydroformylation and the selectivity for the 
resulting aldehydes. However, rhodium carbonyl is unstable 
and hence used in forms modified with a ligand containing 
phosphorous, arsenic or antimony, among which organic 
phosphorous compounds such as triphenyl phosphine are  
 
preferably used. Butenediol is readily obtainable by partial hydrogenation 
of butynediol, which is manufactured from acetylene by 
Reppe reaction on a large scale. Butenediol can also be 
obtained by hydrolyzing diacetoxy-2-butene, which is 
synthesized from butadiene. U.S.P. 3,859,369 discloses hydroformylation of 
butenediol by using a catalyst of rhodium or the like with a 
ligand of a phosphine. It is, however, difficult to achieve a high yield in 
obtaining the desired compound of 2-formyl-1,4-butanediol in 
accordance with the process disclosed in U.S.P. 3,859,369. 
This is because that the reaction in this process 
necessarily causes 4-hydroxy-2-methylenebutyraldehyde in a 
considerably large amount or that the reaction itself 
terminates midway to cause a large amount of the starting 
material butenediol to remain unreacted. While it is necessary, in order to obtain the desired 2-formyl-1,4-butanediol 
in a high yield, to maintain the 
reaction temperature at a low level, the use of a phosphine 
as described in this U.S.P. then results in a markedly low 
reaction rate. For the purpose of avoiding the above 
problems and achieving a satisfactory reaction rate on an 
industrial basis, it may be considered to use a large amount 
of a rhodium catalyst. Since rhodium catalysts are very 
expensive, their
