<ABSTRACT>
A tetrode type electrophoretic display (10) includes local anode lines (32) electrically grouped into groups having the width of a character. In operation, the local anode (32) may be used to blink selected characters by applying appropriate voltages to the various electrodes of the display (10) in the proper sequence. Sequencing is controlled by a computer and associated software.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophoretic display panel
apparatus and methods of operation and, more particularly, to multi-electrode
electrophoretic display panels which permit the blinking of displayed
characters.Electrophoretic displays (EPIDS) are now well known. A variety
of display types and features are taught in several patents issued in the names
of the inventors herein, Frank J. DiSanto and Denis A. Krusos and assigned
to the assignee herein, Copytele, Inc. of Huntington Station, New York. For
example, U.S Patent Nos. 4,655,897 and 4,732,830, each entitled
ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY PANELS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS
describe the basic operation and construction of an electrophoretic display.
U.S. Patent No. 4,742,345, entitled ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY
PANELS AND METHODS THEREFOR, describes a display having improved
alignment and contrast. Many other patents regarding such displays are also
assigned to Copytele, Inc. The following issued patents and pending
applications by the inventors herein and assigned to CopyTele, Inc. and which
may have some relevance to the present invention are: U.S. Patent No.
5,276,438, filed November 20, 1991, entitled ELECTROPHORETIC
DISPLAY PANEL WITH INTERNAL MESH BACKGROUND SCREEN;
DUAL ANODE FLAT PANEL ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY
APPARATUS, U.S. Patent No. 5,053,763, issued October 1, 1991;
ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY WITH SELECTIVE LINE ERASURE,
U.S. Patent No. 5,066,946 issued November 19, 1991; SEMITRANSPARENT
ELECTROPHORETIC INFORMATION DISPLAYS (EPID) EMPLOYING
MESH LIKE ELECTRODES, U.S. 5,041,824 issued on August 20, 1991; 
U.S. Patent No. 5,223,115 (EP-A-0 601 075) filed on August 23, 1991 entitled
ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY WITH SINGLE CHARACTER
ERASURE, which is a continuation of Serial No. 699,216 filed on May 13,
1991 having the same title;
EP-A-0 575 475
entitled ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY PANEL WITH PLURAL
ELECTRICALLY INDEPENDENT ANODE ELEMENTS, each of which are
indicated below.The display panels shown in the above-mentioned patents
operate upon the same basic principle, viz., if a suspension of electrically
charged pigment particles in a dielectric fluid is subjected to an applied
electrostatic field, the pigment particles will migrate through the fluid in
response to the electrostatic field. Given a substantially homogeneous
suspension of particles having a pigment color different from that of the
dielectric fluid, if the applied electrostatic field is localized it will cause a
visually observable localized pigment particle migration. The localized pigment

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a tetrode-type electrophoretic
display of the type having a plurality of parallel cathode lines

(18) arranged in a given direction, a plurality of parallel grid
lines (20) insulated from said cathode lines (18) and perpendicular

thereto to form an X-Y addressing matrix, a plurality of
local anode lines (32) deposited upon said grid lines (20), perpendicular

thereto and insulated therefrom by insulator strips, a

remote anode separated from said local anode lines with the space
therebetween accommodating an electrophoretic dispersion including

pigment particles suspended in a fluid and an electrically
conductive mesh screen allowing said pigment particles to pass

therethrough, including the steps of:

(a) applying an alternating current to said mesh screen;
(b) supplying individual voltages to selected cathode
and grid intersections and to said local anode lines (32) to fully write

characters to said display;
(c) selecting one of said characters written to said
display for blinking;
(d) applying a first potential bias of a given polarity
between a group of cathode and grid intersections, said group

corresponding to a displayed character area occupied by the character
selected during said selecting step, and at least one associated

anode line long enough to cause pigment particles to
move relative to said intersections and to thereby erase the

selected character;
(e) applying a second potential bias of an opposite
polarity between said associated anode segment and said group of

cathode and grid intersections for a period of time sufficient to
rewrite the selected character to said displayed character area;
(f) sequentially alternating between steps (c) and (d)
until a different character is selected for blinking.
The method according to claim 1, wherein a character
is selected for blinking during said selecting step by depressing

a key.
The method of claim 1, wherein steps (c) through (e)
are performed under the control of a computer program.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said anode lines
are arranged in a plurality of groups, each group

including a plurality of parallel, electrically coupled line elements.
The method according to claim 4, wherein each of said
groups has an overall width corresponding to the width of a

displayed character area.
The method of claim 1, wherein each anode line element
preferably has four tines with spaces there between for at

least a portion of the length thereof.
The method of claim 4, wherein the number of said
groups is twenty-four, each of said groups having twenty-six line

elements.
