<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing polyoxyalkylene high molecular 
weight compounds having an average molecular weight of 

more than 20,000 and being soluble in solvents and moldÂ­
able by addition-polymerizing ethylene oxide alone or a 

mixture of alkylene oxides containing ethylene oxide to an 
organic compound having at least 2 active hydrogen groups 

to produce a polyhydroxyl compound having an average 
molecular weight of not less than 1,000, and esterifying the 

polyhydroxyl compound with a polycarboxylic acid, its 
anhydride or its lower alkyl ester.
