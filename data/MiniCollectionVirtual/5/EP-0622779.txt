<ABSTRACT>
An active adaptive noise canceller (100) that does not 
require a training mode and operates over an extended noise 

bandwidth. The canceller partitions the noise bandwidth 
into frequency sub-bands, and multiple adaptive filter 

channels (120, 140) are employed, one for each sub-band, to 
cancel noise energy in the respective sub-bands. Each 

channel includes bandpass filters (121, 130) to restrict 
the channel to operation over only the particular sub-band, 

and delays are inserted in the operation of the filter 
weight updating. Because each channel is stable over its 

sub-band, the canceller operates over the extended noise 
bandwidth of all the sub-bands.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention as it is defined in the appended claims relates to active noise cancellation
systems, and more particularly to systems having
extended frequency stability regions so as to permit the
suppression of broader bandwidth disturbances.The objective in active noise cancellation is to
generate a waveform that inverts a nuisance noise source
and suppresses it at selected points in space. In active
noise cancelling, a waveform is generated for subtraction,
and the subtraction is performed acoustically, rather than
electrically.In a basic active noise cancellation system, a noise
source is measured with a local sensor such as an accelerometer
or microphone. The noise propagates acoustically
over an acoustic channel to a point in space where noise
suppression is desired, and at which is placed another
microphone. The objective is to remove the acoustic energy
components due to the noise source. The measured noise
waveform from the local sensor is input to an adaptive
filter, the output of which drives a speaker. The second
microphone output at the point to be quieted serves as the
error waveform for updating the adaptive filter. The
adaptive filter changes its weights as it iterates in time
to produce a speaker output that at the microphone looks as
much as possible (in the minimum mean squared error sense) 
like the inverse of the noise at that point in space.
Thus, in driving the error waveform to have minimum power,
the adaptive filter removes the noise by driving the
speaker to generate inverted noise in order to suppress it.Many previous active noise cancelers use the filtered-X
LMS algorithm, which requires a training mode. The
function of the training mode is to learn the transfer
functions of the speaker and microphones used in the system
so that compensation filters can be inserted in the feedback
loop of the LMS algorithm to keep it stable. As the
physical situation changes, the training mode must be reinitiated.
For example, in an automobile application to
suppress noise within a passenger compartment, the training
mode may need to be performed again every time a window is
opened, or another passenger enters the compartment, or
when the automobile heats up during the day. The training
mode can be quite objectionable to passengers in the
vehicle.U.S. Patent 5,117,401 describes an active adaptive noise canceller which
does not require a training mode. The insertion of a time
delay in the computation of the updated weights modifies
the frequency stability regions of the canceller.
