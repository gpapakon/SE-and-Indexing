<ABSTRACT>
Antiviral nucleoside analogues contain a substituted benzimidazole base attached to a carbocyclic ring in a place of the conventional sugar residue. Particularly preferred compounds include those in which the 2-,5- and 6- positions of the benzimidazole base are substituted by halogen. The compounds have activity against herpes virus especially cytomegalovirus and also hepatitis B virus infections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to purine nucleoside analogues containing a carbocyclic ring in
place of the sugar residue, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, and their use in
medical therapy, particularly for the treatment of certain viral infections.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA containing virus which infects humans. It is a
member of the class of closely related viruses known as the hepadnaviruses, each member of
which selectively infects either mammalian or avian hosts, such as the woodchuck and the
duck.Worldwide, HBV is a viral pathogen of major consequence. It is most common in Asian
countries, and prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The virus is etiologically associated with
primary hepatocellular carcinoma and is thought to cause 80% of the world's liver cancer. In
the United States more than ten thousand people are hospitalized for HBV illness each year,
an average of 250 die with fulminant disease.The United States currently contains an estimated pool of 500,000-1 million infectious carriers.
Chronic active hepatitis will develop in over 25% of carriers, and often progresses to cirrhosis.
it is estimated that 5000 people die from HBV-related cirrhosis each year in the USA, and
that perhaps 1000 die from HBV-related liver cancer. Even when a universal HBV vaccine is
in place, the need for effective anti-HBV compounds will continue. The large reservoir of
persistently infected carriers, estimated at 220 million worldwide, will receive no benefit from
vaccination and will continue at high risk for HBV-induced liver disease. This carrier
population serves as the source of infection of susceptible individuals perpetuating the instance
of disease particularly in endemic areas or high risk groups such as IV drug abusers and
homosexuals. Thus, there is a great need for effective antiviral agents, both to control the
chronic infection and reduce progression to hepatocellular carcinoma.Clinical effects of infection with HBV range from headache, fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting,
anorexia and abdominal pains. Replication of the virus is usually controlled by the immune
response, with a course of recovery lasting weeks or months in humans, but infection may be
more severe leading to persistent chronic liver disease as outlined above. In "Viral Infections of Humans" (second edition, Ed., Evans, A.S. (1982) Plenum Publishing
Corporation, New York), Chapter 12 describes in detail the etiology of viral hepatitis
infections.Of the DNA viruses, the herpes group is the source of many common
