<ABSTRACT>
Modular metering device, making it possible to supply metered quantities of any pasty or viscous substance, comprising a main body (10) in which are arranged a fitting socket (12), a closure pin (13) and a metering piston (17), arranged opposite each other in the said socket (12), thus defining a metering chamber (4), an inlet channel (14) and an ejection channel (15), at least one control unit (31) making it possible to move the metering piston, actuation means (20) making it possible to move the said closure pin and the said piston simultaneously with respect to the said main body, so as to release access either to the inlet channel (14), or to the ejection channel (15), the main body (10), the closure pin (13) and the metering piston (17) constituting an interchangeable module (1).

Metering device, characterised in that it comprises a main body (10),
in which an adjusting socket (12) is disposed delimiting a bore passing through

said body, a stopping pin (13) disposed partially and movably in said socket, a
metering piston (17), disposed partially and movably in said socket opposite

the stopping pin (13), a metering chamber (4), movable and of variable volume,
being delimited by the inner wall of the socket (12), the pin (13) and the piston

(17), at least one admission channel (14) and one ejection channel (15), each
connected independently to the metering chamber (4) in order to allow the

admission and the expulsion of the substance to be metered, at least one
control unit (31) allowing the metering piston (17) to be displaced in order to fill

or empty said chamber (4), actuating means (20) allowing said stopping pin
and said piston to be displaced simultaneously with respect to said main body

so as to free the access either to the admission channel (14) or to the ejection
channel (15), and in that the main body (10), the stopping pin (13) and the

metering piston (17) constitute an interchangeable module (1) fixed to the
actuating means by means of detachable assembling means (2).
Metering device according to claim 1, wherein said assembling means
(2) are screw-type means.
Metering device according to one of the claims 1 or 2, wherein said
actuating means (20) comprise a movable support (25) actuated by lateral

displacement means (26) serving to displace laterally the stopping pin (13) and
the metering piston (17), and where a fastening body (21) keeps said main

body fixed during this displacement.
Metering device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein the
control unit (31) is fixed to the movable support (25).
Metering device according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
said lateral displacement means (26) are of the pneumatic type. 
Metering device according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
said control unit (31) is of the pneumatic type.
Metering device according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the
stopping pin (13) and the piston (17) co-operate with the actuating means (20)

owing to the detachable insertion of driving heads (19a, 19b) of each of these
elements in the positioning slots (24) made on fixing blocks (27) of the movable

support (25).
Metering device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a regulating nut (16) is disposed between each piston (17)

and the control unit (31), allowing the stroke of each piston to be changed
independently.
Metering device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that it comprises a single interchangeable module (1).
Metering device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that it comprises more than cne interchangeable module (1).
