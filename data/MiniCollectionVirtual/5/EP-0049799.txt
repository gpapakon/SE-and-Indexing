<ABSTRACT>
A photomask (B) is fabricated by forming, in a photo­
mask (hard mask) produced by forming a patternized film 

(3a) of a masking material such as metallic chromium, a 
chromium oxide, a chromium nitride, metallic silicon, a 

silicon oxide or a mixture thereof on a transparent substrate 
(1), a metallic film (2) of a translucent and electroconductive 

material selected from Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti, V, W, Cr, Au and Zr 
between the masking film (3a) and the transparent substrate 

(1). At the time of pattern transferring by photolithography, 
dropping off of parts of the pattern of this photomask does 

not occur even when it includes isolated island-like parts, 
and, at the time of inspection by electron-beam exposure, 

the precision of inspection does not lower. The photomask, 
by further comprising a chemically resistant and translucent 

protective film (5) between the electroconductive film (2) and 
the masking film (3a), is free of destruction of the electrocon­

ductive film (2) during the repeated washing between the 
repeated use of the photomask.

<DESCRIPTION>

 PHOTOMASK BLANK AND PHOTOMASK
 This invention relates generally to photomask blanks and photomasks for use in the production of semiconductors, integrated circuits (IC), large-scale integrated circuits (LSI), and like electronic components. More specifically, this invention relates to photomasks of the type generally called hard masks and to their blanks.


 In general, a photomask blank is fabricated by forming on an outer surface of a transparent substrate a thin metal film or, in place thereof, a thin film of a masking material by a process such as vacuum evaporation or sputtering. By applying a photolithographic process including the steps of forming a photoresist film, pattern exposure to light, and etching to this photomask blank, a film of the above mentioned metal or masking material is left in the form of a pattern such as a pattern of a circuit for an IC or an LSI on the transparent substrate thereby to produce a photomask.


 This photomask is superposed on a semiconductor wafer and thus used for pattern transfer exposure, but since the photomask is actually an expendable article, the common practice at present is to fabricate beforehand a master mask or, further, a sub-master mask and, with the use of this master mask or sub-master mask, to fabricate masks for transferring patterns onto semiconductor wafers. For reasons of cost, photomasks having a silver emulsion film as a light-screening or masking film are frequently used as photomasks for pattern transfer.


 A circuit pattern on the above mentioned hard mask comprises a film of a material such as metallic chromium or chromium oxide in scattered state on a glass plate.


This film is not necessarily continuous over its entire expanse, there being parts existing in isolated island-like state on the glass plate. A problem arises in the following two cases as described below. The first case is that wherein this hard mask is used as a master mask or a  sub-master mask and caused to contact a mask blank having a silver emulsion film, onto which the circuit pattern of the master mask is transferred. The second case is that wherein the circuit pattern of a mask is caused to contact a semiconductor wafer which has been coated with a resist thereby to transfer the circuit pattern.


 In each of these cases, static electricity is generated by friction at the time of intimate contact and peeling off, and a discharge phenomenon occurs between the pattern parts of the hard mask. Consequently, particularly at the peripheral parts of the film
