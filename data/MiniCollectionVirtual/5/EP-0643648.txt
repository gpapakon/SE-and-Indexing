<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle driveline including a control system subject to operator demand, and a continuously-variable-ratio transmission (CVT) including a variator of torque-controlled type, in which the control system includes a performance "map" of optimum relationships between engine torque and speed over a range of values of those two quantities, and in which the control system regulates both the energy input to an engine and also the reaction torque at the variator so as to seek a state in which the mapped optimum relationship between engine torque and speed is maintained. The variator may be of the toroidal-race rolling-traction type, reaction torque within it being regulated by controlling the operating force applied to the variator rollers. The control system may act so as to compute the variator reaction torque with relation to two alternative calculations based on the transmission input and output torques respectively, and may choose for operation at any given time the calculation yielding the lesser value of that variator reaction torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control systems for drivelines 
including continuously-variable-ratio transmissions (CVT's). By 
a driveline I mean a combination of components comprising in 
sequence a prime mover or other engine, the CVT, and a driven 
output connectable to a point of use. The invention applies 
especially but not exclusively to drivelines for automotive 
vehicles, in which the output will be connected directly or 
indirectly to driven wheels of the vehicle. More particularly, 
it can apply to drivelines in which the CVT includes a variator - 
that is to say a ratio-varying component - of torque- controlled 
type, especially one where the variator is of the toroidal-race 
rolling-traction type and the torque transmitted by the rollers 
is controlled by an operating force generated by hydraulic 
pressure, applied to a piston or like operating member to which 
each such roller is connected. Examples of such variators are 
described, for instance, in Patent publication WO90/05860, from which the features 
outlined in the preamble of claim 1 are known. In a contemporary vehicle driveline including a variator of 
the toroidal-race rolling-traction type, the key component can be 
expected to be a computerised control system, programmed to 
receive inputs of two kinds. The first such input is the drivers 
demand, typically for engine power and typically communicated by 
way of the throttle pedal. The second such input comprises a 
multiplicity of electronic signals, of both command and 
responsive type. The essential command signal will be an input 
representing an engine "map", that is to say a desired and 
programmed relationship ("control line") of engine output torque 
(TE) and engine output speed (NE), over the effective working 
range of the engine. Thus engine power (T) can be inferred from 
either torque (TE) or speed (NE) values for operation on the 
control line. The "responsive" input signals continuously supply 
the control system with the instantaneous values of quantities 
such as the actual value of NE, the actual speed NO delivered by  
 
the CVT output to the driven wheels or other point of use, and 
the reaction torque TR being transmitted across the variator. 
Appropriate processing of these inputs, by means well known in 
the art, enable the control system to compute other key 
measurements including the instantaneous ratio R being 
transmitted by the variator, TE and the instantaneous torque TO 
at the CVT output. In practice the control system will also 
receive further inputs

<CLAIMS>
A driveline comprising a control system (5) subject to operator demand, and a 
continuously-variable-ratio transmission (CVT) (2) driven by a prime mover or other 

engine (1), and having an output connectable to a point of use, the energy input to the 
engine (1) being subject to variable regulation by the control system, in which the CVT 

includes a variator (3) - that is to say a ratio-varying component - of torque-controlled type 
and in which the control system (5) is operable to regulate the reaction torque experienced 

within the variator (3), in which the variator (3) is of the toroidal-race rolling-traction type, 
and the control system (5) regulates the variator reaction torque by controlling the operating 

force applied to the variator rollers, in which the roller operating force is exerted 
hydraulically, the hydraulic control pressure being regulated by the control system (5), 


characterised in that
 the control system (5) is adapted continually to compute the variator 
reaction torque (T
R
) with relation to alternative calculations based on the transmission 
input (T
E
) and output torques (T
O
) respectively, and in that the system chooses for 
operation the calculation yielding the lesser value of variator reaction torque (T
R
) and 
applies a related hydraulic control pressure. 
A driveline according to Claim 1 in which the control system (5) includes first and 
second closed-loop control systems each responsive to operator demand (6), a first such 

system correlating engine speed (N
E
) to engine output torque (T
E
), and the second such 
system relating to the variator operating force to the torque load (T
E'
) which the variator (3) 
imposes on the engine (1) 
characterised in that
 response of the second closed-loop of the 
control system (5), to an operator demand for higher engine speed (N
E
) and thus increase 
in fuel supply, results in sequence in a relatively rapid fall in the torque load (T
E'
) imposed 
upon the engine by the variator until the variator (3) operating force reaches a value 

appropriate to the demanded speed, after which the torque load (T
E'
) and engine speed 
(N
E
) both rise until both quantities attain the values predicated by the optimum relationship 
in operation. 
A driveline according to Claim 2 
characterised in that
 response of the two 
closed-loops of the control system, to an operator demand for higher engine speed and thus 

an increase in fuel supply, is altered by modifying the correlation of torque load (T
E'
) and 
demanded speed (N
E
), whereby the initial rapid increase in engine torque resulting from  
 

the operation of the first control loop is shared between increasing both engine torque (T
E
) 
and the torque load (T
E'
) imposed upon the engine (1) by the variator (3), after which 
engine speed (N
E
) rises and engine torque (T
E
) and the torque load (T
E'
) both fall until 
engine speed (N
E
), engine torque (T
E
) and torque load (T
E'
) together attain the values 
predicted by the optimum relationship in operation.
