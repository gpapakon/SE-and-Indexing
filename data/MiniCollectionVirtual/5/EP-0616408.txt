<DESCRIPTION>
Because battery is portable and mobile, it is widely 
used for various kinds of appliances, such as electric 
vehicles, etc. But the kind of storage, or fuel, or thermal, 
or sun-power battery has physical basic voltage. Generally 
speaking, we shall choose its voltage and capacity by means 
of its multiple series and supply it in accordance with the 
need of load by means of graded voltage, or control it by 
serial linear members, or operate it by chopped wave 
switches. This is an efficient circuit design mainly to 
provide a multi-output graded multi-voltage, and further by 
means of the action time difference between solid switch 
members and electromechanic switch members, the switching 
functions of low heat loss and non-sparkle multi-voltage can 
be attained. FIG 1 is a view of two-knife and two-throw switch 
multiple series diode for multi-voltage switch according to 
an embodiment of the invention. FIG 2 is a view of linear adjustment voltage wave of 
multi-voltage. FIG 3 is a view of chopped wave adjustment voltage wave 
of multi-voltage. FIG 4 is a view of multi-voltage switch circuit of 
two-knife and two-throw switch.  FIG 5 is a view of multi-voltage switch circuit of 
single-knife switch. FIG 6 is a view of using tree-branch switch circuit and 
series diode to form a multi-voltage circuit. Now referring to FIG 1, a view of an embodiment of low 
heat loss, non-sparkle, graded multi-voltage control circuit 
for battery or multiple unit independent DC power supply, 
mainly by means of battery and serial two-throw (C) contact 
switch, it forms a multi-voltage output composed of 
alternative switch, and when outputting, it will make switch 
contact multiple series connect to segmented diode's two 
ends so as to eliminate diode's direct voltage reducing and 
thermal loss, and it can further combine with current 
inspection device and linear or switch-mode solid switch 
member, and combine with a central control unit (CCU) to 
accept operation order of input device instruction so as to 
control electric-mechanical switch and solid switch member 
for adjusting output voltage current flow or adjusting the 
output constant voltage, or set the limits of output current 
value, or constant current and "by means of linear 
adjustment or solid switch member of PWM adjusting control 
which is disposed serially in battery and diode and between 
their on-off switches of switch multi-voltage output, the 
low pressure becomes valley and high pressure of second 
section becomes peak for the circuit of linear

<CLAIMS>
A power supply comprising a plurality of batteries 
(V1-V6) arranged in a sequence between positive and 

negative output terminals, with switching means (SW101-SW105) 
between each battery and the next in sequence and 

with computer control means (CCU) for operating the 
switching means, characterises in that the switching 

means each comprise a double-pole double-throw switch 
arranged either to connect each battery to the next in 

series, or to connect the poles of two consecutive 
batteries each to the output terminal of like polarity. 
A power supply according to claim 1 in which each 
battery pole other than the endmost is connected through 

a diode (101a - 105b) to the output terminal of like 
polarity, the sense of the diode being such as to conduct 

current from the battery to the output terminal, whereby 
the diodes provide a path for transient currents on 

opening or closing of the switch contacts. 
A power supply according to claim 1 or claim 2 
including a current sensor (CT100) and/or a voltage 

sensor (VT00) providing input signals to the computer 

control means to control the operation of the switches 
so as to provide a required output waveform. 
A power supply according to claim 3 further 
including solid sector switching means (SSS100) connected 

in series with the output terminal and controlled by the 
computer control means to provide a continuously 

controlled output voltage or current.
