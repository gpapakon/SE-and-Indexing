<ABSTRACT>
In a process for accelerating the setting and 
hardening of a material which contains a hydraulic binder 

or which consists of a hydraulic binder there is used a 
setting accelerating mixture which is free of alkali 

metals and free of chlorides. Said setting accelerating 
mixture contains at least one water soluble sulfate of a 

polyvalent cation and a further constituent which is 
selected from the group consisting of calciumaluminate, 

calciumsulfoaluminate, basic aluminum salts, mixtures 
thereof or mixtures containing at least one of said 

constituents and a further component. 
If the water soluble sulfate of the polyvalent 
cation is aluminumsulfate then said compound has to 

contain crystal water in order to provide the water solubility 
of said product. 
With the setting accelerating mixtures a fast 
gaining of strength of a corresponding mortar or concrete 

is achieved and the finally hardened product has better 
mechanical characteristics than corresponding products 

prepared without the adding of any set accelerating admixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for 
accelerating the setting and hardening of a material 
which contains a hydraulic binder or a latent hydraulic 
binder or which consists of a binder with or without a 
latent hydraulic binder by adding a mixture which contains 
at least one component which is selected from the 
group consisting of calcium aluminate, calcium sulfoaluminate 
and basic aluminum salts. The set accelerating 
mixtures are free of chlorides and free of alkali metal 
ions. It is well known in the art that the setting 
and hardening of a hydraulic binder or of a mixture which 
contains a hydraulic binder can be accelerated through 
the adding of a setting accelerator or hardening accelerator. 
Typical examples of binders are cement, like Portland 
cement, lime, slake limes, gypsum and mixtures 
thereof and typical examples of mixtures which contain 
such a binder and further components are mortar and concrete. The most commonly used setting accelerators 
however are substances with strongly alkaline properties, 
like alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, 
alkali metal silicates and alkali metal aluminates. Substances 
with strongly alkaline properties however are undesired  
 
due to health risks which they can cause when 
persons are handling such substances, and specially etching 
of the skin of the worker, harmful effects onto the 
respiratory system, specially the lungs, and irritation 
of the eyes and even an etching of the cornea can occur. Furthermore the introduction of alkali metal 
ions into mortar or concrete has an adverse effect onto 
the properties of the construction material. For example, 
through the incorporation of strongly alkaline setting 
accelerators into concrete, the final compressive 
strength of the hardened construction material is lowered, 
and the shrinkage is increased, which may result in 
the development of cracks in the construction material. 
Thus the stability and the lasting quality and durability 
of the building is deteriorated. A further group of frequently used setting 
accelerators and hardening accelerators contains chlorides 
like alkaline earth metal chlorides. Any chloride 
containing materials however are undesired at a construction 
site because they have a corrosive effect onto the 
different equipments used at the construction site and 
also the corrosion of reinforcing bars and nets is increased 
through chloride ions. Furthermore it is well known in the art that 
any set accelerators which contain chlorides reduce the 
che
