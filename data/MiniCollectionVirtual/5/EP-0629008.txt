<ABSTRACT>
This diode is used for a liquid crystal display of an active matrix type. The parasitic capacitance of the diode 
can be reduced, and a film with a large area and an even thickness can be formed, making it possible to fabricate a 

large liquid crystal display. An MIM diode has a structure made up of a metal layer for the lead-in electrode which is 
connected to a data bus, an ITO layer for the transparent electrode for forming a pixel, a metal layer for an electrode 

connecting the metal layer for the lead-in electrode, and the ITO layer, and an insulating layer between the metal 
layers for the lead-in electrode and connecting electrode. In this diode, a layer of porous aluminium oxide p-Al₂O₃ is 

formed between the insulating layer and the metal layer for connecting electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to active matrix type of liquid 
crystal display (LCD) and, more particularly, to metal-insulator-metal 
(MIM) diode structure used as switching elements for liquid 
crystal display and the method for manufacturing the same. A liquid crystal display, using liquid crystal material 
having light transmission index and refraction index which are 
changed according to changes in electric field, magnetic field 
or temperature, is small and light, can be operated by low 
voltage and has a relatively low power consumption; hence, it has 
various applications. In order for the liquid crystal to display precise pictures, 
it requires plurality of pixels and therefore, the liquid crystal 
display is constructed as matrix type, which is composed of 
plurality of signal electrodes (X electrodes) and scanning 
electrodes (Y electrodes). The X and Y electrodes are arranged 
to intersect each other and at intersection points, liquid 
crystal molecules are selectively lit with time differences by 
applying voltage between both electrodes. However, this simple matrix type has a limitation: the duty 
cycle can not be increased and therefore, can not display precise 
pictures because of the so called cross-talk phenomena i.e. 
voltage is applied to non-selected intersection points according  
 
to increase of the number of scanning electrodes. In order to overcome this limitation, it has been developed 
a liquid crystal display of an active matrix type in which 
switching elements for switching liquid crystal molecules are 
arranged as matrix shape. The active matrix type is generally 
divided into two types, one type using thin film transistor and 
the other type using diode. MIM diode structure is widely 
utilized for the diode type. The MIM diode structure utilizes the property that a thin 
film comprising tantalum oxide (Ta₂O₅) shows very nonlinear 
current-voltage property. An shown in Fig. 1, MIM diode D 
switches to cause liquid crystal molecules corresponding to 
selected pixels excited only when the pixels to become are 
selected by signal electrodes X arid scanning electrodes Y and are 
applied by greater voltage than the threshold voltage. The 
resistance of non-selected pixels becomes high, so that liquid 
crystals serve as capacitors and accordingly, this structure has 
memory capability to store the picture until the next operating 
voltage is applied. An active matrix type of liquid crystal display using 
conventional MIM diode structure is illustrated in Fig. 2. As 
shown in Fig. 2, a
