<ABSTRACT>
Blends of colorants with styrene-acrylonitrile 
types of copolymers are rendered homogenous by the 

presence of a low molecular weight ester. The blends 
are useful as color concentrates for let down into 

acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene graft copolymer 
compositions. The blends resist separation of the 

colorant from copolymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic color 
concentrate compositions which are blends of a 
thermoplastic resin and a colorant, and more 
particularly relates to thermoplastic color 
concentrate composition which are blends of a 
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and an organic 
colorant. Blends of a thermoplastic styrene-acrylonitrile 
copolymer and a colorant have been previously used as 
color concentrates for let down into natural color 
thermoplastic materials. However, such blends can 
experience separation of the colorants from the 
thermoplastic resin during transport, fluidization or 
during rest under vibratory conditions. 
Additionally, these prior blends can experience 
uneven distribution of the colorants dispersed 
therein which can result in surface blemishes in the 
final molded parts obtained after let down of the 
color concentrate blends into additional 
thermoplastic resin. Consequently, there is a need for providing 
color concentrate compositions in the form of blends 
of styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers with colorants 
wherein the compositions exhibit homogeneity as 
evidenced by uniform dispersal of colorant in the 
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, and which exhibit  
 
resistance to separation of the colorant from the 
styrene acrylonitrile copolymer during transport, 
fluidization or during rest under vibratory 
conditions. The invention provides a thermoplastic color 
concentrate composition, which comprises a blend of:
 
   a thermoplastic resin, preferably a styrene-acrylonitrile 
copolymer;
 
   a colorant, preferably an organic colorant; and
 
   a low molecular weight ester having a molecular 
weight of between 200 and 1000 gram per mol, and more 
preferably an alkyl aryl phthalate. The thermoplastic color concentrate compositions 
are ternary blends characterized in part by 
homogeneity of the composition and uniform dispersal 
of the colorant therein, and resistance to separation 
of the colorant from the thermoplastic resin upon 
experience to vibratory conditions. The compositions 
are useful for let down into natural color 
thermoplastic materials so as to provide the desired 
colored molding resin for making molded thermoplastic 
articles, or extruded articles, requiring defect free 
surface appearance and uniform color over large 
quantities of colored thermoplastic. The thermoplastic resin composition of the 
present invention is useful as a color concentrate 
(colorant premix) for uniform coloration upon let 
down into natural color thermoplastic molding and 
extr
