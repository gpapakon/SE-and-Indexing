<ABSTRACT>
Optical time domain reflectometry methods and 
apparatus are proposed in which the back-scattered 

optical radiation used to produce output signals is 
restricted to that resulting from Rayleigh scattering 

of light launched into a fibre 2 at a first wavelength 
and that in an anti-Stokes spectral band resulting from 

Raman or Brillouin scattering of optical radiation at 
the first wavelength. A first set of output signals 

produced in dependence upon the anti-Stokes back-scatter 
may be normalised to the geometric mean of a 

second set of output signals, produced in dependence 
upon the Rayleigh back-scatter at the first wavelength, 

and a third set of output signals, produced in 
dependence upon Rayleigh back-scatter resulting from 

light launched into the fibre at the anti-Stokes 
wavelength. Growth in the intensity of optical 

radiation in a first Stokes (Raman or Brillouin) 
spectral band may be inhibited, so as to suppress 

stimulated scattering, for example by making the fibre 
2 high loss at the Stokes wavelength and/or launching 

into the fibre 2, simultaneously with the pulse at the 
first wavelength, an additional pulse at a third 

wavelength equal to that of a Stokes spectral line 
resulting from inelastic scattering of optical 

radiation at the first Stokes wavelength. The first 
wavelength may be chosen so as to minimise the 

transmission loss, in view of the average losses at the 
first and detected wavelengths or the increase with 

wavelength of the launch power which can be used before 
stimulated scattering has a specified effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical time
domain reflectometry (OTDR) methods and apparatus for
carrying out such methods.In OTDR light at a first wavelength (λ0) is
launched into one end of an optical fibre and optical
radiation back-scattered along the fibre is measured.
In distributed sensing using OTDR the back-scattered
radiation is used to measure respective values of a
physical parameter at different locations along the
fibre, which is deployed in a region of interest. In
optical time domain reflectometers, which are used for
characterising fibres in their production environments
or in installed cables, the back-scattered optical
radiation is used, for example, to locate faults in the
fibre or to measure the attenuation characteristics of
the fibre.The back-scattered signals may result from either
elastic or inelastic scattering processes. Rayleigh
scattering produces elastically scattered signals with
a wavelength distribution substantially the same as the
injected signal (λ0). Brillouin and Raman scattering
on the other hand are inelastic scattering processes
which each produce pairs of spectral bands. Each pair
of first order bands comprises one (the Stokes band)
centred on a longer wavelength (λ+1) than that of the
injected signal (λ0) and the other (the anti-Stokes
band) centred on a shorter wavelength (λ-1) than that
of the injected signal, such that the pair is centred
on the injected signal wavelength. The spectrum would
normally contain several successive orders (at
wavelengths λ±n, where n=1,2,3...) resulting from a
particular scattering process, the intensity of the
bands decreasing as the order increases. In some
silica-based materials the Raman spectrum contains more
than one band of significant intensity, for example, in 
a binary P2O5.SiO2 glass, P2O5 has a band around
1390cm-1 in addition to the main silica band at around
440cm-1.For an injected signal of 904nm in silica,
Brillouin anti-Stokes and Brillouin Stokes
back-scattered signals are shifted by about 0.05nm from
the injected signal, and the first order Raman Stokes
and Raman anti-Stokes back-scattered signals are
shifted by about 34nm. The wavelength shifts for the
Brillouin and Raman scattered signals are respectively
about 0.058nm and 50nm for a 1.06µm signal, and about
0.084nm and 100nm for a 1.53µm injected signal in
silica.The Brillouin and Raman back-scattered signals
have intensities dependent on physical parameters, such
as temperature. Typically for silica fibres at room
temperature, the Raman Stokes and
