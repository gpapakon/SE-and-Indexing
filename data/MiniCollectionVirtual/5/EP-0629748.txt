<ABSTRACT>
Dual-control flush mechanism, able to allow either complete or partial emptying of the cistern (R) of the type including:   - a substantially vertical overflow tube (13), a submersible float (15) arranged at the base of the said tube and provided at its lower end with a valve (19) for shutting off the emptying orifice (12) of the said cistern (R), the tube/float assembly (13/15) being movable in axial translation under the effect of a drive mechanism, with respect to a fixed bell housing; - a valve (17) which is movable under the effect of the said drive mechanism, in axial translation with respect to the said tube/float assembly (13/15), between a first position of closing off the lower opening (16) at the base of the said float (15), and a second opening position allowing water to enter into the said float (15); - a first and a second control buttons (23, 24) associated with the drive mechanism, the said first button (23) making it possible to order complete emptying and the said second button (24) allowing partial emptying; - characterised in that it includes at least one electromechanical actuation element (28) linked to the said drive mechanism and capable of being actuated by the first and second control buttons (23, 24) by means of an electric/electronic control circuit (29-42).
