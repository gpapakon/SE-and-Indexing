<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastener feeder 
apparatus for fastener driving devices and in particular, 
but not exclusively, for fastening devices used in 
continuous production lines having a feeding mechanism for 
feeding successive fasteners into the drive track of the 
device. Conventional staple feeding mechanisms must perform 
the task of feeding and holding the staples in the drive 
track. In certain devices, sticks of staples are loaded 
onto a magazine that is angled downward so that the force 
of gravity aids in pulling the staples down to the nose of 
the device and into the drive track to be driven therefrom. 
However, in certain applications, the fastening device may 
need to be horizontally disposed or disposed at an upward 
inclination, thus, the force of gravity alone is 
insufficient to feed and hold the staples in the drive 
track. To increase the force on the staples at the nose of 
the device, a mechanism having a friction clutch and a 
wheel connected to an electric motor has been used. Thus, 
as the motor turns, the clutch maintains a certain torque 
on the wheel which in turn keeps a constant forward force 
on the staples. When a staple is driven, the remaining 
staples are fed and held forward toward the drive track. 
Although this type of feed mechanism works well for its 
intended purpose, it requires an extra power source to be 
connected to the device, and is inefficient and expensive. Other conventional feed mechanisms employ a spring 
biased pusher which contacts the rearmost staple of the 
staple stick urging the staples forward along a guide to 
the drive track. The device is effective in feeding and  
 
holding the staples in the drive track, however, when a 
staple stick has been exhausted, the pusher must be 
retracted to allow another staple stick to be placed on the 
guide. In a continuous production line, such interruptions 
can be disruptive and costly due to lost productivity. The present invention seeks to provide fastener feeder 
apparatus having advantages over known apparatus. According to the present invention there is provided 
fastener feeder apparatus for supporting a fastener package 
within fastener driving apparatus and for moving successive 
leading fasteners of the fastener package in a feeding 
direction along a feed path into a drive track to be driven 
by a fastener driving element during the drive stroke 
thereof and outwardly of the drive track into a workpiece, 
characterised by first support means for supporting a 
plurality of resilient
