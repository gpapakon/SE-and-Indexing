<ABSTRACT>
An automatic transmission mechanism having multiple 
ratio gearing and clutch and brake elements operated by 

fluid pressure operated servos for changing speed ratio in 
the transmission and a controller for actuating and 

releasing the clutches and brakes in response to operating 
demands determined by sensed variables such as vehicle 

speed, engine torque, manual valve position, transmission 
turbine speed, and engine temperature, and means for 

achieving improved control of a synchronous downshift event 
by electronically regulating the exhaust pressure from an 

off-going friction element of the clutch and brake 
structure, thus controlling the torque-carrying capacity of 

that off-going element during the downshift interval.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic transmission and
particularly relates to a multiple ratio transmission
mechanism for use with an automotive vehicle having an
internal combustion engine and fluid pressure operated
clutches and brakes for establishing speed ratios determined
by the powertrain operating requirements.This invention relates to a transmission control system
of the kind shown in EP-A-0626528.Transmission gearing mechanism capable of being
controlled by the control system of our invention may be
seen by referring to U.S. Patent No. 4,938,097.This invention includes features that are common to the
control system described in U.S. Patent No. 5,157,608,
issued to B.G. Sankpal, J.A. Daubenmier, L.J. Kurdziel, J.F.
Carnago, W. Lewis, Jr., and R.S. Williams. The '608 patent
also is assigned to the assignee of our invention.Each of the transmission structures disclosed in the
reference patents and in the copending patent application
mentioned above has four-speed ratio transmission gearing in
which the high speed ratio is an overdrive. Each describes
also gearing having a single reverse ratio. When a shift is
made from the third ratio, which is a direct-drive ratio, to
the next underdrive ratio, which is the second speed ratio,
it is necessary to disengage a clutch and to engage a break
in synchronous fashion.Both the clutch and the brake are friction elements.
Each is operated by a fluid pressure operated servo. Thus,
the downshift event requires a synchronous disengagement of
a clutch and engagement of a brake. Because of differences
in temperature and in friction coefficient due to wear, and
because inertia forces differ depending on the speed at
which a 3-2 downshift occurs, calibration of the 3-2 
downshift to achieve optimum smoothness presents a design
challenge. Even if the downshift can be properly calibrated
for a given set of operating conditions, that calibration
may not be appropriate at a later time when operating
conditions are dissimilar.The improved valve system of this invention overcomes
shift quality concerns of the kind described in the
background discussion above. It is capable of providing
better control of a synchronous downshift event, both a 4-2
downshift and a 3-2 downshift. Electronically regulating
the exhaust pressure of the off-going friction element,
according to our invention, will appropriately control the
torque-carrying capacity of that element during a downshift,
thus improving the timing of the shift synchronization and
achieving maximum shift smoothness.A
