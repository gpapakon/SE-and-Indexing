<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to ion selective electrodes, and ion selective
sensors, and more specifically to a solid contact
material for use in such devices.In many settings, for example the clinical laboratory or the analytical or industrial
chemical laboratory, the need for rapid analysis of the concentration of a variety of ionic
species or analytes in solution exists. Conventionally, in such analyses, an ion selective
electrode is brought into contact with a test solution into which a reference electrode is
also immersed. The ion selective electrode and the reference electrode are connected via
a voltmeter and a potentiometric determination of the activity of a particular analyte in
solution is made. The activity measurement may be correlated to the concentration of
the analyte in solution using reference solutions or standard solutions of known
concentration.Typically, ion selective electrodes have been fabricated according to the following
designs. One conventional design consists of an internal redox couple reference
electrode, an ion-selective membrane, and an internal liquid electrolyte contacting the
reference electrode and the membrane. The ion selective membrane is advantageously
fabricated so as to include therein a particular molecule selectively complexing the ion
to be analyzed, and the electrolyte advantageously includes a relatively high concentration
of the ion to be analyzed and the anion of the redox couple, for example chloride in a
silver/silver chloride reference. The potentiometric determination is based upon the
principle that the electromotive force detected by the voltmeter is proportional to the 
logarithmic concentration of analyte in solution. Standard solutions of known analyte
concentrations are typically used and a calibration curve is established in such analyses,
and the concentration of analyte in the test sample is determined by comparison with the
calibration curve. However, such a system requires maintenance of the electrode in an
environment in which the electrode is not permitted to dry out, and is not amenable to
electrode significant miniaturization, for example in the fabrication of planar electrodes.Hydrogels, that is, neutral polymeric matrices incorporating salts, have been
employed in ion selective electrodes in a manner similar to that of the above-described
liquid electrolyte. However, hydrogels tend to swell unacceptably during use. Such
swelling may have several detrimental effects, one of which is physical disruption,
ultimately rupture,
