<ABSTRACT>
The tube exhibits moduli (moduluses) in tension, measured at 23@C, in the longitudinal direction and in the transverse direction, of at least 3000 MPa and an external diameter/thickness ratio lying between 10 and 100. This tube is particularly suitable for producing large-diameter pipelines for transporting using gravity and distributing fluids under pressure.
