<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing ceramic prostheses, which can be employed to manufacture ceramic prostheses (endoprostheses and exoprostheses) with the same variety of shapes and the same accuracy as metallic prostheses.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of highly accurate and
three dimensionally complex ceramic endo- and

exoprostheses comprising

(a) forming a porous ceramic blank of the following
composition (in weight percent) zirconium oxide

and hafnium oxide 94,8% up to 95,3%, yttrium
oxide 4% up to 5,2%, any further oxide less than

0,1% with a monoclinic proportion of below 5%
working over this blank by means of dense

sintering or filtration to form a semi-finished
product,
(b) working over the semi-finished product to final
dimensions of a prosthesis by means of a rotating

tool comprising metallically bound diamond grains

at a speed of rotation of between 10'000 and
50'000 revolutions per minute, an infeed rate of

between 0,1 and 0,7 millimeters per minute, a
feed rate along the workpiece of between 0,3 and

3.0 centimeters per second and surface speeds of
the tool of between 0,5 and 9.0 meters per

second.
A process according to claim 1 
characterised
 thereby
that the blank is shaped as a disk.
A process according to claim 1 
characterised
 thereby
that the blank is formed by way of slip casting,

dried, roasted, subjected to hot isostatic post-compacting,
and then subjected to oxidizing posttreatment

to form the semi-finished product. 
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 3

characterised
 thereby that the working over operation
to form a prosthesis is effected by means of digital

detection and calculation of the dimensions of a
prosthesis pattern input of the detection and

calculation data into a data processing control means
and output of the data to a machining means movable in

three co-ordinates for moving the tool
