<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for reproducing images on a silver halide light-sensitive 
material for medical X-ray diagnosis 
for use as a hardcopy of electronically 
stored images. There is a trend in medical diagnosis to provide hardcopies of 
images, produced by electronic diagnostic techniques such as 
computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound etc., by 
means of a digital laser imager, replacing rapidly the older 
technology of CRT printers due to several advantages. As opposed to 
the said analog CRT camera's, a laser images is a digital system 
containing a high performance digital computer. Instead of just 
printing the images, the incoming images can be stored temporarily 
in an electronic memory and the data as well as the lay-out of the 
images can be manipulated before actually being printed on a film. 
This electronic memory offers the possibility to buffer the incoming 
data from several diagnostic modalities by means of an image 
network, which is a real advantage in comparison with e.g. CRT 
imaging wherein the hard copy is exposed image by image. In that 
case, while one examination is taking place, the imager is 
unavailable for others and as a result, each diagnostic unit 
requires a separate CRT imager. The photographic hardcopy material, used in the laser imagers, 
combines an excellent image quality with the appropriate physical 
properties, necessary for an error free filmhandling by the imager. 
With regard to image quality, the photographic material preferably 
has high sharpness, a good image tone of the developed silver, and 
the appropriate contrast values to allow a high maximum density and 
crisp alfanumerics. Another trend in medical imaging is the demand for rapid access 
of the photographic images. Especially when implemented in an image  
 
network, the access time of the laser hardcopy material should be as 
short as possible. Factors responsible for delayed rates at which 
the process proceeds may be the exposure time of the film by the 
laser, the transport time before exposure to the system and after 
exposure to an automatic processor, and the processing time, dry-to-dry, 
of the hardcopy material. Whereas the exposure time and 
transport time are dependant on specific features of the laser 
source, the mechanical construction of the system and the dimensions 
of the hardcopy material, the processing time is especially 
determined by the film characteristics and the chemicals used in the 
processing cycle. Typical modern processors have
