<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an electrotherapy apparatus with at least two electrodes between which the tissue to be treated is placed. The electrodes are powered by a low-frequency (for instance 1 Hz) a.c. supply with a superimposed beat frequency of, for instance, about 10 Hz, which represents a voltage envelope of about 4000 Hz.

Electrotherapy device with electrodes, between which a tissue 
to be treated can be arranged, an alternating voltage (13) with 

a frequency f
s
 of between 1 Hz and 100 Hz being present between 
the electrodes, characterised in that this alternating voltage 

(13) is the envelope of an alternating field (U
M
) with a 
frequency of approximately 4000 Hz, and in that an alternating 

voltage (12) with a frequency f
g
 of between 0.1 and 5 Hz is 
linearly superimposed, where f
g
 
<

alternating voltage (13) with the frequency f
s
 is no greater than 
the amplitude of the alternating voltage (12) with the frequency 

f
g

Electrotherapy device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the alternating voltage (12) with a frequency f
g
 of between 
0.1 and 5 Hz is a sinusoidal or cosinusoidal alternating voltage. 
Electrotherapy device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the alternating voltage (13) is a beat voltage which is 

formed by the superimposition of two voltages with frequencies 
which are close together and are at approximately 4000 Hz, for 

example 4000 Hz and 3990 Hz. 
Electrotherapy device according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the superimposition is carried out in a mixer (22) which is 

supplied with the output voltages of a first and a second 
oscillator (20, 21). 
Electrotherapy device according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the output of the first mixer (22) is transmitted to a 

second mixer (24) which is also supplied with the output signal 
of an alternating-voltage generator (27) having a frequency of 

between 0.1 and 5 Hz.  
 
Electrotherapy device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that an amplifier (23) is provided between the first mixer (22) 

and the second mixer (24). 
Electrotherapy device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the output of the second mixer (24) is connected to a 

regulable amplifier (25), the output of which is connected to the 
electrodes (1, 2). 
Electrotherapy device according to Claim 1 and Claim 3, 
characterised in that the amplitude (U
G

G/2
) of the 
alternating voltage (12) with the frequency of between 0.1 and 

5 Hz is approximately twice as large as the antinode (U
S
) of a 
beat. 
Electrotherapy device according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the amplitudes of the two superimposed voltages are of the 

same size.
