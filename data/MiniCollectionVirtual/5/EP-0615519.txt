<ABSTRACT>
A structure (10 or 100) useful for separating contaminants from fluids or exchanging heat between two fluids includes a fused single crystal acicular ceramic support (12 or 112) having a discriminating layer (38 or 128) disposed on at leat part of the support. The support has at least one channel that extends entirely through the body. If the structure is used as a filter, the discriminating layer is suitably a sintered, porous alpha-alumina membrane or other porous membrane. If the structure is used as a heat exchanger, the discriminating layer is impermeable. The support is preferably composed of a non-stoichiometric acicular mullite. The support may be in either a dead-end or cross-flow configuration. The structure may include plugs (22 and 23) to close off one end or the other of the channels in the support. The structure preferably includes end caps (118) over the ends of the support. The end caps should be of the same ceramic as used in the support. The ceramic material used in the support, plugs and end caps is interlocked, thereby connecting the plugs and end caps to the support. The filter is preferably covered by a fired, enamel glaze on the outside of the support and the end caps. A method for making the filter includes the step of converting a green ceramic support in situ into acicular ceramic particles, preferably into whiskers. The method preferably entails affixing the support, plugs and end caps together by interlocking them by the conversion step.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STRUCTURE FOR A FILTER OR A HEAT EXCHANGER AND A METHOD FOR MAKING THE STRUCTU RETechnical Field-. This invention relates generally to a ceramic structure for filtering of, or heat exchange between, fluids, either liquids or gases. Background of the InventionCeramic filter media are commonly used in a wide range of fluid handling procedures, including filtration, diffusion, recovery, transfer, mixing and foaming. Ceramic,.0 filter media are also employed as catalysts themsel es, or as carriers for catalysts. Ceramics possess several advantages as media for fluid handling over alternatives such as organic or metallic filter media. One advantage is a superior resistance to deterioration from heat or chemical exposure.Ceramic filter media are most often used in the form of an aggregation of .. ceramic particles, either loose or bound to one another. The ceramic particles can be formed as spheres, platelets or needles. The particles are routinely obtained by crushing and classifying (that is, sorting by size) a previously manufactured mass of the desired material. This method of manufacture is subject to some drawbacks, however. Crushing a formed material can degrade some desirable structural characteristics of the material, such as its impact strength,-n mechanical strength, rigidity, porosity or aspect ratio.Even if ceramic particles can be successfully classified, subsequent aggregation of the particles to attain rigidity or improve a physical or mechanical property may require sintering or the use of a bonding agent. Alternatively, the particles may be aggregated by placing them in a metal container. The containers can, however, be expensive and may not be... completely resistant to the gas or liquid being treated. It can also be difficult to achieve a good seal between the metal container and the particles If a good seal is not obtained, fluid may leak around and bypass the particles.Ceramic filter media have also been used as supports for discriminating layers such asfluorocarbon polymers or sintered ceramic membranes. These supports have typically 

 been made from previously fired spherical particles of alpha-alumina (Î±-A^O.) orcordierite. The particles have then been lightly sintered to bond them together and give them mechanical strength. Unfortunately, many of the resulting supports did not have possess sufficient strength, particularly against impact or against the pressure of fluid flowing through them. The resulting supports typically had a porosity of no more than about 30% (or 70% of
