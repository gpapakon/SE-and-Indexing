<ABSTRACT>
An electrical switch has a contact point which is composed of a moving contact piece (12) and a stationary contact piece (13) and is located in an antechamber in front of an arc splitter stack. The stationary contact piece is connected via a connecting conductor (18) to a connecting terminal, the connecting conductor covering the antechamber plate and running partially parallel to that arc guide rail which is opposite the arc guide rail to which the stationary contact piece (13) is fitted. Located between the antechamber and the connecting conductor (18) is an antechamber plate (28) which engages by means of a wall piece (29) into the intermediate space between the subregion (22) and the arc guide rail (26), in order to insulate them from one another. An optimum blowing effect onto the arc (30) during a switching operation is produced as a result of the arrangement of the connecting conductor above the antechamber plate and the parallel-running subregion (22).

<CLAIMS>
Electrical circuit breaker having a contact point 
(12, 13) which is accommodated in an antechamber space 

and has a stationary contact element (13) and a moving 
contact element (12) which interacts therewith and is 

fitted on a contact lever (10) which can pivot, having a 
first arc guide rail (16) which is connected to the 

stationary contact element (13) and having a second arc 
guide rail (27) on which one root of an arc (30) forming 

during a switching operation jumps, which guide rails 
(16, 27) hold an arc extinguishing chamber, for example 

an arc splitter stack, between them at their end, having 
chamber plates (27a) which are arranged on both sides of 

the antechamber space and bound the said space on both 
sides, and having a connecting conductor (18, 17a, 22) 

which runs partially parallel to the second arc guide 
rail between the stationary contact element (13) and one 

of the connecting terminals, characterized in that the 
connecting conductor (17, 17a, 22) covers the antechamber 

space and in that one of the chamber plates (28), which 
is arranged between the connecting conductor (18) and the 

antechamber space, is arranged with a wall attachment 
(29) running perpendicular to it between the second arc 

guide rail (27) and that subelement (22) of the connecting 
conductor (18, 17a, 22) which runs parallel thereto. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that one of the antechamber plates, 

preferably that having the wall part (29), is formed from 
insulating material which emits gas. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that, on its side facing away from the  

 
antechamber, the antechamber plate (28) has grooves for 

accommodating the connecting conductor (18) outside the 
antechamber.
