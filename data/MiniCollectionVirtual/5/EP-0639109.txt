<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides in a combustion effluent. The inventive process generally involves treating urea under conditions effective to form a urea hydrolysate; introducing the urea hydrolysate into the effluent (50), under conditions effective to form ammonia and produce an ammonia-containing effluent; and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides in the effluent by passing the ammonia-containing effluent through a catalysis zone (30) comprising a catalyst effective for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in the presence of ammonia.

 DESCRIPTIONPROCESS FOR THE CATALYTIC REDUCTION OF NITROGEN OXIDESRelated ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. Patent Application entitled "Nitrogen Oxides Reduction Using a Urea Hydrolysate", having Serial No. 07/820,907, filed in the names of von Harpe, Pachaly, Lin, Diep, and egrzyn on January 16, 1992; and U.S. Patent Application entitled "Catalytic/Non-Catalytic Combination Process for Nitrogen Oxides Reduction", having Serial No. 07/626,439, filed in the names of Luftglass, Sun, and Hofmann on December 12, 1990, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a process for reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx, where x is an integer, generally 1 or 2) in the effluent from the combustion of carbonaceous fuels and other organic matter by a catalyzed reaction. The process involves the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides in an efficient, economical, and safe manner not heretofore seen. 

 Carbonaceous fuels can be made to burn more completely, and with reduced emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons, when the oxygen concen¬ trations and air/fuel ratios employed are those which permit high flame temperatures. When fossil fuels are used in suspension fired boilers, such as large utility boilers, temperatures above about 2000°F and typically about 2200°F to about 3000°F are generated. Unfortunate¬ ly, such high temperatures, as well as hot spots of higher temperatures, tend to cause the production of thermal NOx/ the temperatures being so high that free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen are formed and chemically combine as nitrogen oxides.Nitrogen oxides can also be formed as the result of the oxidation of nitrogen containing species in the fuel, such as those found in heavy fuel oil, municipal solid waste, and coal. NO^ can form even in circulating fluidized bed boilers, which operate at temperatures typically ranging from 1300°F to 1700°F.Nitrogen oxides are troublesome pollutants which are found in the combustion effluent streams of boilers and other combustion units when fired as described above, and comprise a major irritant in smog. It is further believed that nitrogen oxides contribute to tropospheric ozone, an acknowledged threat to health, and can undergo a process known as photochemical smog formation through a series of reactions in the presence of sunlight and hydrocarbons. Moreover, nitrogen oxides comprise a significant contributor to acid rain, and have been implicated as
