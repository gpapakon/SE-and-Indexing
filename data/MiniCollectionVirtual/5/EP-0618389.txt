<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diaphragm valves and more 
particularly to a diaphragm valve with a single inlet port 
and two outlet ports. It is often necessary in fluid process piping systems 
to divert the flow of fluid from one stream to another. 
This can be accomplished through the use of a diverter 
(three way) valve or using two valves connected to each 
other through a tee or wye branch fitting. At this time, 
there does not exist a diverter valve in a weir style 
hermetically sealed configuration which can accomplish this 
end. The current practice then is to use two weir style 
diaphragm valves connected with a tee or wye as described 
above. The problem in such an arrangement, in addition to 
the more installation space required, is that fluid will 
stagnate, contaminants will accumulate, or micro-organisms 
will grow in the branch flow passage when the valve 
connected to that passage is closed. These same conditions 
can occur when the valve connected to the wye or tee pipe 
line is closed and the fluid diverted through the branch 
passage. Accordingly, the problem of eliminating dead legs which 
contribute to the accumulation of contaminants and growth of 
micro-organisms is overcome by the diverter valve of the 
invention. An object of the invention is to provide a diaphragm 
valve for diverting the flow of fluids from a single branch  
 
port to one or the other of two branch ports. According to the broader aspects of the invention, the 
diaphragm valve is configured so as to direct the flow of 
fluid coming from the inlet port into a single chamber and 
then from this chamber across one of two weirs located at 
opposite ends of the chamber through to a corresponding 
outlet port. Other objects, aspects, and features of the invention 
will become more fully apparent from the following detailed 
description of the preferred embodiment, the appended 
claims, and the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a partial cross-sectional view of the 
diverter valve according to the invention; Figure 2 is a top view taken along line 2-2 of Figure 1 
with a partial cross-sectional view of a corner of the 
valve; Figure 3 is a planar end view of the valve body taken 
along line 3-3 of Figure 1; and Figure 4 is a view taken along line 4-4 of Figure 1 
with the valve body shown in cross-section. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a unitary formed 
valve body 10, which may be cast or machined from iron, 
bronze, or stainless steel, or molded from a suitable 
plastic or plastic composite material.

<CLAIMS>
A diverter valve comprising: 
   a unitary formed valve body; 

   an inlet port and a chamber located on one side of said 
body adjacent said inlet port and extending the length of 

said body; 
   first and second weirs located at opposite ends of said 

body and chamber; 
   first and second outlet ports being located in said 

body on a side opposite said inlet port, each said ports 
being centrally displaced on either side of the axis of said 

inlet port; 
   said first and second outlet ports having associated 

first and second channels formed in said body and directed 
toward said first and second weirs respectively; 

   said body having first and second end faces parallel to 
said first and second weirs and perpendicular to the axis of 

each said inlet and outlet ports; and 
   first and second diaphragms mounted to said first and 

second end faces of said body for selectively engaging one 
said associated first and second weirs, such that when said 

first diaphragm is closed against said first weir, fluid 
flow is prevented from said chamber to said first channel 

and outlet port, and when said second diaphragm is open and 
away from said second weir, fluid flow is directed from said 

chamber over said second weir and through said second 
channel and outlet port. 
The diverter valve according to claim 1 including: 
   first and second stem means respectively coupled to 

said first and second diaphragms; and 
   first and second bonnets for mounting respectively 

therein said first and second stems. 
The diverter valve according to claim 2 including: 
   first and second actuator means mounted respectively on 

said first and second bonnet means for engaging and moving 
said first and second stem means to effect corresponding 

movement of said first and second diaphragms against or away 
from the respective first or second weir. 
A diverter valve for fluids comprising: 
   a valve body having a chamber extending therethrough 

and an inlet port connected to said chamber; 
   a first weir located at a first end of said body 

transverse to said chamber and formed between said chamber 
and a first channel and exit port in said body; 

   first operating means including a first diaphragm 
movable toward and away from said first weir, such that when 

said first diaphragm is positioned against said first weir, 
said chamber and first channel and exit port are isolated to 

prevent fluid flow therebetween; 
   a second weir located at a second end of said body 

opposite said first end and transverse to said chamber, said 
second weir formed between said chamber and a second channel 

and exit port in said body; 
   second operating means including a second diaphragm 

movable toward and away from said second weir, such that 
when said second diaphragm is positioned against said second 

weir, said chamber and said second channel and exit port are 
isolated to prevent fluid flow therebetween. 
The diverter valve according to claim 4 wherein when 
said first diaphragm is positioned away from said first 

weir, said inlet port and chamber is in fluid connection 
with said first channel and exit port; and

 
   when said second diaphragm is positioned away from said 

second weir, said inlet port and chamber is in fluid 
connection with said second channel and exit port. 
A valve for diverting the flow of fluids from a single 
inlet port to one or the other of two outlet ports 

comprising: 
   a unitary formed valve body defining a through chamber 

connected to said inlet port; 
   said body having at a first end a first channel 

connected to a first outlet port, and a first weir formed 
between said chamber and said first channel; 

   a first closure means for selectively sealing against 
said first weir to prevent fluid communication between said 

chamber and said first channel; 
   said body having at a second end opposite said first 

end a second channel connected to a second outlet port, and 
a second weir formed between said chamber and said second 

channel; and 
   a second closure means for selectively sealing against 

said second weir to prevent fluid communication between said 
chamber and said second channel. 
The valve of claim 6 wherein said first closure means 
includes a first diaphragm which is sealingly secured to the 

first end of said body for sealing against said first weir 
in one position and, in another position, away from said 

first weir forms the wall of a first passage permitting 
fluid flow between said chamber and said first channel. 
The valve of claim 7 wherein said second closure means 
includes a second diaphragm which is sealingly secured to 

the second end of said body for sealing against said second 
weir in a first position and, in a second position away from 

 
said second weir forms the wall of a second passage
