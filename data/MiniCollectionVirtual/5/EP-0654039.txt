<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for
extracting hemoglobin from erythrocytes and purifying
hemoglobins. The methods of the present invention are
particularly suitable for the extraction and purification
of hemoglobin from erythrocytes on a commercial scale.Advances have occurred in recent years in the
development of hemoglobin-based blood substitutes. Such
transfusional fluids serve as alternatives to whole blood
or blood fractions for use as oxygen carriers and plasma
expanders.The use of whole blood and fractions thereof
has grown increasingly disfavored because of the risk of
immune or non-immune reactions and infections, such as
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Even if it were
possible to reduce these risks to an acceptable level,
a need would still exist for non-native hemoglobin-based
blood substitutes because of the chronic short supply of
human-based products. To meet the demand for
transfusional fluids, researchers have sought to develop
a hemoglobin-based blood substitute free of the risks
associated with whole blood and whole blood products.Initial efforts were directed to developing
hemoglobin solutions free of stromal components. Stromal
components had been identified as a cause of coagulopathy
and associated renal failure. Rabiner et al., J. Exp.
Med., 126, 1127 (1967), used centrifugation and
ultrafiltration procedures to prepare stroma-free
hemoglobin solutions. Stroma-free hemoglobin solutions
were prepared by re-crystallization by DeVenuto et al.,
J. Lab. Clin. Med., 89, 509 (1977).The need to remove stromal phospholipids from
hemoglobin-based blood substitutes is well-known. See,
e.g., Bolin et al., "Advances In Blood Substitute 
Research," Prog. Clin. Biol. Res., 122, 117 (1983). In
addition, hemoglobin-based blood substitutes must have
a low oxygen affinity and a long transfusion half-life,
and be substantially free of endotoxins, DNA and non-heme
proteins and polypeptides.Stromal contamination results from proteolysis
during the separation of hemoglobin from erythrocytes.
In PCT Patent Application No. WO 91US/09615, this problem
was addressed by dialyzing the erythrocytes under
slightly hypoosmotic conditions that rendered the cell
membranes permeable to hemoglobin with a minimum of
lysis. Nevertheless, unwieldy multiple chloroform
extractions and centrifugations were still needed to
reduce the stromal phospholipids to safe levels.Endotoxins are found as a result of bacterial
contamination. A synergistic toxicity between hemoglobin
and endotoxin was recognized as early
