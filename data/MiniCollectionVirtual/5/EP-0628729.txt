<ABSTRACT>
A directional control valve (10) and a valve assembly for 
incorporating a plurality of control valves (10) is disclosed, in 

which use of a manifold base, subplates and the like is 
unnecessary. A supply 

port (P) for a pressurized fluid, output ports (A,B) and 
exhaust ports (EA, EB) which open into a valve hole (26) are 

defined in a main valve body (20) constituting the directional 
control valve (10). The main valve body (20) has linking surfaces (20,24) 

thereon for linking together a plurality of control valves (10) 
in a valve assembly. The supply port (P) and the exhaust 

ports (EA,EB) penetrate in a direction in which the main 
valve bodies (20) are linked together at positions deviated from 

an opening position of the valve hole (26). In addition, the 
output ports (A,B) open through output passages (48,50) on one side 

surface (28) of the main valve body (20) perpendicular to the linking 
surfaces (20,24). Connecting grooves (42,44) are defined on upper and 

lower 
surfaces of the main valve body (20). A plurality of the main 

valve bodies (20) thus constituted are disposed in a linking 
manner between a pair of end plates (12,14), and tie rods (88,90) are 

inserted into the connecting grooves (42,44) so as to clamp the main 
valve bodies (20) between the end plates (12,14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a directional control valve
according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a valve assembly
employing a plurality of individual directional control valves
which are connected together in a linked construction whereby
a desired number of individual valves can be linked together
without using a manifold base, subplates and the like.The document MACHINE DESIGN, Vol. 56, April 1984, Cleveland,
Ohio, USA "Scanning for Ideas", page 44, "Slotted Valve
Bodies" discloses valve bodies according to the preamble of
claim 1. These valve bodies include isolator plates completely
separating and preventing fluid flow in any direction through
the valve channels on opposite sides of the isolator plate.Further, there have been previously known valve structures in
which a plurality of directional control valves are installed
on an integrated manifold base having a supply passage and an
exhaust passage for a fluid, whereby the valves are capable
of mutual communication with each other in a linking manner
in order to collectively supply and exhaust a pressurized
fluid to the plurality of directional control valves.However, when a plurality of directional control valves are
installed on a manifold base or subplates, as described above,
problems arise in that time and labor are required for 
installation of the directional control valves on the manifold
base or subplates, and the manifold or subplates 
require the directional control valves to occupy a large
space and height. Further, difficulties arise in that it
becomes necessary to prepare the manifold or subplates
taking into account the number of directional control valves
which are to be linked together, so that the manifold or
subplates correspond to the length of the so-linked
directional control valves. As a result, the number of
required parts increases, and an inconvenience arises in
that production cost for the directional control valves and
the valve assembly thereof increases.In order to solve such problems, there has been proposed
a valve assembly in which a plurality of directional control
valves are stacked together, and in which supply ports and
exhaust ports to be mutually communicated by such a linking
construction are connected by bolts and nuts passing through
connecting holes which extend through the directional
control valves.Such directional control valves and valve assemblies
have advantages in that time and labor for installing the
directional control valves are decreased, and the space and
height required for
