<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a floating-calliper disc brake. To avoid tangential oblique wear, the brake shoes (8, 9) and the brake calliper (1) or a pressure plate (13) arranged on the actuating-side brake shoe (8) are "decoupled" from one another to ensure corotation with the brake disc (5). The brake shoes (8, 9) are supported on a brake anchor plate (7) only on the exit side of the brake disc, whereas the calliper (1) and, if required, the pressure plate (13) are supported on the brake anchor plate (7) only on the disc entry side and therefore counteract deformation of the brake and the associated oblique wear with a "pulling" action.

Disc brake with torque plate (7) a brake disc (5), a brake pad on the actuating unit 
side (8) and a brake pad on the wheel side (9), a brake caliper (1) with a leg on the 

wheel side (3) floating axially to the brake disc (5), a locking device (11AF) 
preventing the wheel side brake pad (9) from rotating with the brake disc (5) by 

anchoring the brake pad (8) on the actuating unit side against the torque plate (7) and 
a locking device (15, 16) to prevent the caliper leg (3) from rotating with the rake 

disc (5) by anchoring the caliper leg (3) against the torque plate (7), characterised by 
the wheel side brake pad (9) and the wheel side caliper leg (3) being allowed to float 

on a plane parallel to the brake disc (5) and that the locking device (11AF) for the 
wheel side brake pad (9) anchors the brake pad (9) only on the brake disc run out side 

against the torque plate (7), whereas the locking device (15, 16) for the caliper leg (3) 
only anchors the caliper leg (3) on the run-in side of the torque plate (7). 
Disc brake according to claim 1, characterised by the locking device (11AB) for the 
brake pad (8) on the actuating unit side anchoring the brake pad (8) only on the brake 

disc run-out side against the torque plate (7). 
Disc brake according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by a pressure plate (13) for 
pushing the brake pad (8) of the actuating unit side against the brake disc (5), 

whereby a locking device (19, 119) anchoring the pressure plate (13) against the 
torque plate (7) is utilised to prevent the pressure plate (13) from rotating with the 

brake disc (5) and that the locking device (19, 119) anchors the pressure plate (13) 
against the torque plate (7) only on the brake disc run-out side. 
Disc brake according to claim 3, characterised by the pressure plate (13) opposite 
brake pad (8) on the actuating unit side, floating on a plane parallel to the brake disc 

(5). 
Disc brake according to claim 4, characterised by the fact that the pressure plate (13) 
and the brake pad (8) on the actuating unit side do not float against each other 

parallel to the brake disc (5). 
Disc brake with torque plate (7), a brake disc (5), a brake pad (8), a locking device 
(11AB) anchoring the brake pad (8) against the torque plate (7) thereby preventing it 

from rotating withe brake disc (5) and a pressure plate (13) to force the brake pad 
(8) against the brake disc (5), characterised by brake pad 8) and pressure plate (13) 

floating on one plane parallel to the brake disc (5) and a locking device (11AB) for 
the brake pad (8 anchoring the brake pad (8) only on the run-out side of the brake 

disc against the torque plate (7), whereas the locking device (19, 119) for the pressure 
plate (13) 
anchors the pressure plate (13) only on the brake disc run-in side of the 
torque plate (7). 
Disc brake according to claim 6, characterised by a locking device (11AF) for the 
wheel side brake pad (9) anchoring the brake pad 9) against the torque plate (7) only 

on the brake disc run-out side.

abutment surface (1 2, 123) of the locking device (119, 10EB) for the pressure plate 

(13) and / or the brake pad (8) being positioned only partially against the normal 
plane surface of the brake disc (5) therefore running on an angle opposite the
