<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a furnace and 
method for drawing an optical fiber capable of drawing 
an optical fiber having only a slight variation in the 
outer diameter. An optical fiber is in general formed by drawing 
while heating and melting a transparent glass mass or 
tube called an optical fiber preform (preform) in an 
optical fiber-drawing furnace. Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of an optical fiber-drawing 
furnace according to the conventional 
technique. Drawing furnaces as shown in Fig. 1 are 
disclosed in, for instance, Japanese Patent 
Application Publication No. 62-138340. As seen from Fig. 1, a furnace body 11 made of 
stainless steel is in general provided therein with a 
heater 13 for heating and melting an optical fiber, 
preform 12. A furnace core tube 14 in which the 
foregoing preform 12 is inserted through the top 
thereof is positioned inside the heater 13. The furnace core tube 14 is in general composed of 
a carbon material and fixed to the furnace body 11 at 
both upper and lower ends of the latter. The furnace 
core tube 14 comprises an upper cylindrical part 14a, 
a funnel-like part 14b and a lower cylindrical part 
14c. The upper cylindrical part 14a is composed of a  
 
cylinder having a diameter slightly greater than that 
of the preform 12. The lower cylindrical part 14c has 
a diameter which is smaller than that of the preform 
12 and permits the passage of a drawn optical fiber 
15. The funnel-like part 14b is positioned between 
the upper and lower cylindrical parts 14a and 14c, 
thus serves to connect the upper cylindrical part 14a 
to the lower cylindrical part 14c and has a shape 
whose diameter is gradually reduced from the upper 
portion to the lower portion thereof along the molten 
portion at the lower end of the preform 12 which is 
drawn into the optical fiber 15. An annular thermal insulating material 16 
comprising, for instance, a carbon felt material is 
disposed between the furnace body 11 and the heater 13 
so as to prevent any external diffusion of the heat 
radiated from the heater 13. Moreover, an upper cylindrical member 17 which is 
communicated with the upper end of the furnace core 
tube 14 is disposed on the top of the furnace body 11. 
This upper cylindrical member 17 is usually made of 
stainless steel and the upper opening thereof is 
covered with a cap member 18. Further the upper 
cylindrical member 17 is provided with a gas 
introduction part 17a at an upper portion thereof. On 
the other hand, a lower cylindrical member 19 is 
positioned
