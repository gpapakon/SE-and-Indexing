<DESCRIPTION>
Subject of the present invention is a new process
for the synthesis of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxy methyl) guanine
(acyclovir) a purine derivative having the following
structure (I)
Of the purine and pyrimidine derivatives having an
open oxygenated chain at nitrogen atom, and can be
considered nucleoside analogues with open sugar
substituent, 9-(2-hydroxyethoxy methyl) guanine was
found particularly effective in the treatment of
diseases due to viral agents such as herpes simplex
virus, herpes zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus. More
recently its usefulness was ascertained, in combination
with other drugs, for the management of pathologies
originated by retrovirus.9-(2-hydroxyethoxy methyl) guanine was claimed by
the British Patent no. 1523865 in 1974. Its
preparation, described in Example no. 6 of the
foregoing patent, is carried out by refluxing overnight
guanine with a very large excess of
hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) (59 moles of HMDS per 1
mole of guanine), to obtain a 2,6,9-trimethylsilyl 
guanine derivative. The reaction is favoured by the
presence of ammonium sulphate in a more than catalytic
quantity (0.86 moles).The HMDS excess is rendered indispensable by the
nearly total guanine insolubility, only slowly and
gradually dissolving as it reacts with HMDS. The excess
of HMDS must then be eliminated by vacuum distillation,
leading to extensive degradation, such as to hinder its
recovery.The raw silyl derivative is dissolved in benzene;
elimination of ammonium sulphate is then carried out by
filtration; triethylamine in benzene and 1 mole of 2-benzoyloxyethoxymethyl
chloride are then added (II)
Cl-CH2-O-CH2CH2-O-CO-Ø
and the mixture is allowed to reflux overnight.
Following evaporation of the solvent 2,6-bis
(trimethylsilyl)-9-benzoyloxyethoxymethyl-guanine is
obtained and the silylated protection groups are
therefrom eliminated by brief reflux in ethanol. 9-benzoyloxyethoxymethyl
guanine (III), obtained by
evaporation of the ethanol, must be thoroughly washed
with water, dried and twice crystallized, first from
methanol and then from water.
The resulting derivative is finally treated in a 
pressure reactor with methanolic ammonia at 80°C, so 9-(2-hydroxyethoxy
methyl) guanine (I) is obtained, to be
recrystallized from methanol.All in all the process is very long and time
consuming: its complicated method entails the use of
several reactors, even under pressure, and of various
solvents, wasting of a costly reagent (HMDS), the
necessity to crystallize the intermediate (III) twice,
from methanol and from
