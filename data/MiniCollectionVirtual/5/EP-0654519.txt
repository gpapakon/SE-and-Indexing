<ABSTRACT>
A combined catalytic cracking and olefin production process uses a coked 
catalytic cracking catalyst as a dehydrogenation catalyst to dehydrogenate an alkane 

feed and form an olefin rich product. The method uses a staged backmixed regeneration 
system to form the dehydrogenation catalyst and to fully reactivate deactivated 

cracking catalyst for reuse in the cracking reaction. The catalyst preferably comprises a 
crystalline tetrahedral framework oxide component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined catalytic cracking and olefin producing
process.The emergence of low emissions fuels has created a need to increase the
availability of olefins for use in alkylation, oligomerization, MTBE and ETBE synthesis. In
addition, a low cost supply of olefins continues to be in demand to serve as feedstock for
polyolefin production.Fixed bed processes for light paraffin dehydrogenation have recently attracted
renewed interest for increasing olefin production. However, these type of processes typically
require a high capital investment as well as a high operating cost. It is, therefore, advantageous
to increase olefin yield using processes which require only a minimal amount of capital
investment. It would be particularly advantageous to increase olefin yield in catalytic cracking
processes.U.S. Patent US-A-4,830,728 discloses a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit
which is operated to maximize olefin production. The FCC unit has two separate risers in
which different feed streams are introduced. The operation of the risers is designed so that a
certain catalyst will act to convert a heavy gas oil in one riser and a different catalyst will act to
crack a lighter olefin/naphtha feed in the other riser. Conditions within the heavy gas oil riser
are modified to maximize either gasoline or olefin production. The primary means of
maximizing production of the desired product is by using a specified catalyst.EP-A-0325437 discloses a process for regenerating a coke-contaminated fluid
cracking catalyst in a regeneration zone at a pressure in the range from above 240 kPa to
446 kPa and a temperature in the range from 650°C to 815°C while injecting the regeneration
zone with enough oxygen-containing regeneration gas to maintain a dense fluid bed of
regeneration catalyst, and regenerate the catalyst before returning it to a fluid cracker,
comprising, 
a) withdrawing a controlled stream of the regenerator catalyst and introducing it
into a dehydrogenation zone at a temperature below those prevailing in the
regeneration zone, the dehydrogenation zone being located in a catalyst cooler,
externally relative to the cracker and regenerator, the amount of the stream
being sufficient to supply the endothermic heat of reaction for dehydrogenation
of alkanes in the dehydrogenation zone,b) introducing a feedstream of the alkanes into the dehydrogenation zone in an
amount sufficient to maintain hot withdrawn catalyst in a state of fluidization in
the catalyst cooler, the state of fluidization existing
