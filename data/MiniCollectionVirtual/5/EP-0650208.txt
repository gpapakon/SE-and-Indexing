<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is an electrode for an electrochemical generator containing a first electronic conductive compound and a second ionic conductive compound which is a sulphur-containing polymer in which the elemental unit comprises a polyether and may contain an ionisable salt, characterised in that the said polymer contains, in the main chain, bonds which make it capable of being oxidised and reduced in a reversible manner. The said elemental unit is preferably a polyether containing two sulphur-containing ternary amine end group functions, of the form:
