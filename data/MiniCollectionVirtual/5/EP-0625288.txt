WOK-lÎ²ll PCT/-S93/011 .Optical Fiber Rare Earth Ion Upconversion Laser SystemBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to laser sources and amplifiers that produce coherent radiation that has a shorter wavelength than the wavelength of the pumping radiation through an upconversion process, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for such upconverting laser sources and amplifiers that operate with a rare earth doped solid state lasing medium that may be pumped with infrared radiation under ordinary ambient temperature conditions to provide upconverted laser radiation in the blue portions of the optical spectrum.Laser systems that produce wavelengths in the shorter wavelengths of the portion of the optical spectrum are highly desirable for a variety of applications. These applications include laser based video display systems and optical systems wherein the higher resolutions afforded by short optical wavelengths are important, such as optical storage systems.Although laser systems have been developed that produce outputs in the shorter wavelengths of the optical spectrum, the value of such systems have been diminished by one or more factors that include high cost, critical alignment and high maintenance. For instance, rare gas ion lasers have both a high purchase price and a high degree of maintenance. Frequency doubling or summing lasers that employ a nonlinear element require critical alignment and high maintenance.A laser source or amplifier that uses solid state components throughout is a desirable configuration for a low cost, low maintenance system, but such lasers have never been able to achieve operation in the shorter wavelengths of the optical spectrum under normal ambient temperature operating conditions. Furthermore, the prior art has not been able to achieve such operation with a continuous or quasi-continuous pumping source.Summary of the InventionThe invention comprises a solid state laser system with a lasant material that comprises a host doped with an activator material that produces coherent radiation in the shorter wavelengths of the optical spectrum when pumped by a single band 

 93/I6511infrared pumping source that provides radiation within the range of approximately 1100 to 1300 nanometers. The infrared pumping source conveniently comprises a solid state infrared laser source such as a laser diode. In the preferred embodiment, for a source of optical radiation, the invention comprises an upconversion process for generating sustained, relatively short wavelength,

What is claimed is:
1. An upconversion process for generating sustained, relatively short wavelength, substantially coherent radiation in the optical spectrum from energy supplied by relatively long infrared radiation under ambient operating conditions, comprising the steps of: circulating substantially single band infrared radiation that has a spectrum within the range of approximately 1080 to 1300 nanometers in wavelength into an active lasant material comprising a glass host and an activator comprising a concentration of rare earth activator ions in said host to provide successive transfers of energy from said infrared radiation to said activator ions to raise their energy state from a ground level to a highest level; recirculating radiation that has a wavelength substantially shorter than said infrared radiation from said active lasant material that is produced by the radiative decay of the energy state of said activator ions in said highest level back to said ground level to stimulate development of relatively short wavelength coherent radiation; and extracting at least said a portion of said relatively short wavelength coherent radiation that passes through said lasant material.
2. An upconversion process for amplifying sustained, relatively short wavelength, substantially coherent radiation in the optical spectrum from energy supplied by relatively long infrared radiation under ambient operating conditions, comprising the steps of: circulating substantially single band infrared radiation that has a spectrum within the range of approximately 1080 to 1300 nanometers in wavelength into an active lasant material comprising a glass host and an activator comprising a concentration of rare earth activator ions in said host to provide successive transfers of energy from said infrared radiation to said activator ions to raise their energy state from a ground level to a highest level; 


 93/16511
injecting relatively coherent radiation that has a wavelength substantially shorter than said infrared radiation into said active lasant material to stimulate production of additional relatively short wavelength coherent radiation that is produced by the radiative decay of the energy state of said activator ions in said highest level back to said ground level; and extracting said relatively short wavelength coherent radiation that passes through said lasant material. 3. An upconversion system for generating sustained, relatively short wavelength, substantially coherent radiation in the optical spectrum from energy supplied by relatively long infrared radiation under ambient operating conditions, comprising: means for circulating substantially single band infrared radiation that has a spectrum within the range of approximately 1080 to 1300 nanometers in wavelength into an active lasant material comprising a glass host and an activator comprising a concentration of rare earth activator ions in said host to provide successive transfers of energy from said infrared radiation to said activator ions to raise their energy state from a ground level to a highest level; means for recirculating radiation that has a wavelength substantially shorter than said infrared radiation from said active lasant material that is produced by the radiative decay of the energy state of said activator ions in said highest level back to said ground level to stimulate development of relatively short wavelength coherent radiation; and means for extracting at least said a portion of said relatively short wavelength coherent radiation that passes through said lasant material.
