<ABSTRACT>
A user interface of simplifying selection of speaker volume level and power conservation level in a computer system. An icon is presented for setting the speaker volume which includes a bar graph of relative speaker volume. By depressing left or right arrow keys the graph moves and the volume level of the speaker is changed. By depressing the down arrow key when setting the volume level, the speaker is beeped to allow for a level check during the setting process. A series of icons are used to indicate and select power conservation level. Each icon includes a battery with a faucet attached to the side of the battery. Different water flow rates indicate the various conservation levels. A human figure is located adjacent the faucet to indicate the user-customerized conservation level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to computer systems, and
more particularly to a user interface for allowing the
user to easily and intuitively set
power conservation levels in a battery-powered
computer.Personal computers are being utilized with greater
and greater frequency. With the rise of new software
applications, such as graphical user interface
applications, more and more people are beginning to use
personal computers. Many of these people have not had
experience using or operating personal computers.
These new users are not in a group which has been using
computers for many years and became experienced with
applications which use command lines for entry and
control, such as those applications under operating
systems such as CP/M or MS/DOS or on mainframe
applications, where complicated command structures and
input requirements are common. To properly utilize
those operating systems or computers the user had to
become familiar with the complicated commands that were
required. As a user became experienced, the command
structures became familiar. However, these commands
were often a great struggle for neophyte users and
therefore limited the actual use of the computer and
its various features and functions for those novice
users. Thus there was and is a major interest in 
developing interface capabilities which are much more
intuitive and easier to use without requiring reference
to bound manuals.This ease of use has been one of the large moving
forces behind the increased trend towards the graphical
user interface as popularized by the Apple Computer,
Inc. Macintosh personal computer. The user interface
was designed to be very intuitive, so that very little
reference to a written manual was actually needed but
instead most of the instructions and operating
techniques could be developed directly from the user
interface itself, sometimes just merely by a common
arrangement and at other times by referencing on-screen
help. This graphical user interface has migrated to
personal computers compatible with the IBM PC with the
development of the Windows program by Microsoft Corp.
and to UNIX-based machines through the Open Look and
X Windows standards.It is desirable to continue this trend to other
functions available in personal computers. One type of computer that is becoming very popular
is the battery powered notebook computer. These are
relatively small computers not much larger than a sheet
of paper and which weigh in the range of 4 to 8 pounds.
They contain liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, hard
disk

of a faucet (74,76) projecting from the battery

representation; and
means (82,84) to indicate selection of a change in the
plurality of displays and related power conservation level,
one (70) of the displays having a representation of a
first, high level of water flowing from the faucet and

being related to a lowest level of power conservation, one
(86) of the displays having a representation of a second,

lower level of water flowing from the faucet and being
related to an intermediate level of power conservation, and

one (94) of the displays having a representation of a user
located adjacent the faucet and being related to a user

selected level of power conservation; and
means coupled to the displays for selecting a change
in the display being presented and the related power

conservation level.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein one (94) of
the displays has a representation of a third, lowest level

of water flowing from the faucet and is related to a
highest level of power conservation.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the means
for selecting a change includes left arrow and right arrow

keys.
A method for selecting and indicating the power
conservation level of a battery-powered computer system,

the method comprising: 

presenting a plurality of displays (70,86,94), each
display including:
a representation of a battery (72), a representation
of a faucet (74,76) projecting from the battery

representation; and
means (82,84) to indicate selection of a change in the
plurality of displays and related power conservation level,
one (70) of the displays having a representation of a
first, high level of water flowing from the faucet and

being related to a lowest level of power conservation, one
(86) of the displays having a representation of a second,

lower level of water flowing from the faucet and being
related to an intermediate level of power conservation, and

one (94) of the displays having a representation of a user
located adjacent the faucet and being related to a user

selected level of power conservation; and
selecting a change in the display being presented and
the related power conservation level.
