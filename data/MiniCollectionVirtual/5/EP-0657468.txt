<ABSTRACT>
The polypeptides of the present invention is produced and secreted in pro-B 
cells, so it may be used for diseases relating to undergrown or abnormal 

proliferation of hematopoietic cells, neuronal enhancement or depression, 
immunological enhancement and depression, for example, inflammatory 

diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis etc.), hematopoietic 
stemcytopenia after bone marrow transplantation, leukocytopenia, 

thrombocytopenia, B lymphopenia and T lymphopenia after chemotherapy, 
anemia, infectious diseases, cancer, leukocytosis, AIDS, neurodegenerative 

diseases (Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis etc.), prevention or treatment of neuronal 
injury, prevention or treatment of disorder of bone metabolism (osteoporosis etc.) 

or tissue repair. The DNA of the present invention may be utilized as an important 
and essential template in preparing the polypeptide of the present invention 

which is expected to possess various use or for diagnosis of and in the treatment 
of gene diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to novel polypeptides produced by human
pro-B cell line and DNAs encoding them. EP-A-0 607 054, which is a prior-art document under Article
54(3) and (4) EPC, discloses a process for constructing a cDNA
library which has a selectivity for signal peptides, that
makes it possible to efficiently identify unknown and useful
polypeptide comprising a signal peptide. A novel polypeptide
consisting of 89 amino acids (including a signal peptide)
produced by a stroma cell line, which is useful as an agent
for preventing or treating, for example, anemia, leukopenia or
infections and the like, and DNAs coding for said polypeptide,
have been identified using said process.Science 261, pp. 600 - 603 (1993) discloses a method to clone,
without the use of specific functional assays, complementary
DNAs (cDNAs) that carry specific amino-terminal signal
sequences, such as those encoding intercellular signal-transducing
molecules and receptors. The vector used in this
system directed the cell surface expression of interleukin-2
receptor fusion proteins when inserts with signal sequences
were cloned in-frame with the correct orientation. An
expression cDNA library was constructed from a bone marrow
stromal cell line, which contained 5' portion-enriched cDNAs
(the average size was 400 base pairs). Two cDNAs that encoded
putative cytokine molecules, stromal cell-derived factor-1α
(SDF-1α) and SDF-1β, which belong to the intercrine-macrophage
inflammatory protein superfamily, were cloned.In Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, Vol. 91, pp. 2305-2309 (1994)
it is taught that generation and proliferation of early B-cell
progenitors have been known to require stromal cell-derived
molecules. A stromal cell line, PA6, was found to produce a
soluble mediator, which was distinct from interleukin 7 (IL-7)
and stem cell factor and supported the proliferation of a 
stromal cell-dependent pre-B-cell clone, DW34. A cDNA clone
encoding this DW34 growth-stimulating factor was isolated by
expression cloning. The nucleotide sequence contained a
single substantial open reading frame of 267 nucleotides
encoding an 89-amino acid polypeptide. The amino acid
sequence of this cytokine, designated pre-B-cell growth-stimulating
factor (PBSF), revealed that it is a member of
intercrine α subfamily. Recombinant PBSF stimulated the
proliferation of DW34 cells for itself and, furthermore,
synergistically augmented the growth of DW34 as well as bone
marrow B-cell progenitors in the presence of IL-7. The present invention is related
