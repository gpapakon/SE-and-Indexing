<ABSTRACT>
A disc cartridge misinsertion preventing mechanism which 
comprises:

 
   a cartridge holder 121 into which the disc cartridge 101 

having a notch 109 for determining an insertion direction formed 
at a corner on one side thereof is insertable and holdable 

therein; and
 

   misinsertion detection means 48 having a misinsertion 
detection portion 93 which is urged by a the disc cartridge 101 

to move in an outer direction of a cartridge holding portion of 
the cartridge holder 121 when said disc cartridge is inserted 

into said cartridge holder 121 and which is engaged with the disc 
cartridge 101 for preventing said disc cartridge 101 from being 

inserted into said cartridge holder 121 when said disc cartridge 
101 is misinserted, and

 
   characterised in that said misinsertion detection portion 93 

of said misinsertion detection means 48 has a width W₁ larger 
than an opening width W₂ of a recess 110 provided on the side of 

the disc cartridge 101 on which the notch 109 is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical disc
recording apparatus for recording information signals upon a
magneto-optical disc housed in a cartridge, and in particular
to a disc cartridge misinsertion preventing mechanism for
preventing a disc cartridge from being misinserted into a
cartridge holder which forms a disc cartridge loading mechanism
for loading the disc cartridge into a disc loading portion
provided in a recording apparatus.Magneto-optical discs including a signal recording layer
in which so called perpendicular magnetization is possible have
been proposed. In order to record information signals on the
magneto-optical disc, an area of the signal recording layer on
which information signals are recorded is heated to a temperature
not less than the Curie temperature by focusing a laser beam and 
irradiating it thereto and an external magnetic field is
applied to this area.Since the signal recording layer which has been heated to
a temperature not less than Curie temperature substantially loses
its coercive force, the magnetization direction is reversed
along the line of the external magnetic field. By reversing the
magnetization direction of the signal recording layer in such a
manner, recording of digital information signals can be
performed.A magneto-optical disc recording apparatus which writes
information signals on such a magneto-optical disc, comprises a
rotary driving device which holds and rotates the magneto-optical
disc, an optical pick-up device for irradiating the
signal recording layer of the magneto-optical disc with a laser
beam and an external magnetic field generator which applies an
external magnetic field upon the signal recording layer. The disc cartridge which houses the magneto-optical
disc and is used for this type of magneto-optical
disc recording apparatus is formed as shown in figures 1
and 2 of the accompanying drawings.The disc cartridge 101 comprises a square main cartridge
body 102 which is formed by abutting upper and lower halves 102a
and 102b so that they are engaged with each other and a magneto-optical
disc 103 which is rotatably housed in the main cartridge
body 102 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A magnetic head opening 104
and an optical head opening 105 are provided in a position which
is middle in a lateral direction of the upper and lower halves
102a and 102b, respectively, which form a main cartridge body 102
in which the magneto-optical disc 103 is housed and is offset to
the front side of the main cartridge body 102. A part of the
signal

A disc cartridge misinsertion preventing mechanism
comprising:


a cartridge holder (121) for receiving and holding disc
cartridges, into which is insertable standard 3½-inch magnetic

disc cartridges (201) having a notch (109) for determining an
insertion direction formed at a corner on one side thereof;
misinsertion detection means (48) having a misinsertion
detection portion (93) which is arranged such that it is urged

by the notch (109) on a standard 3½-inch magnetic disc
cartridge (201) to move in an outer direction of a cartridge

holding portion of the cartridge holder (121) when the disc
cartridge is inserted into said cartridge holder (121) in the

correct orientation and it engages with the standard 3½-inch
magnetic disc cartridge (201) to prevent the disc cartridge

(201) from being further inserted into said cartridge holder
(121) when the disc cartridge (201) is inserted in an incorrect

orientation, and

   characterised in that said misinsertion detection portion
(93) of said misinsertion detection means (48) has a width (W
1
)
larger than an opening width (W
2
) of the recess (210) provided
on the side of the standard 3½-inch magnetic disc cartridge

(201) such that said misinsertion detection portion (93) is
prevented from moving into said recess (210).
A disc cartridge misinsertion preventing mechanism
according to claim 1, wherein said cartridge holder (121) is

provided with a rotatable shutter opening and closing means 
(45) for opening and closing a shutter (107) of the disc

cartridge (101) inserted into said holder (121) and is provided
with a spring member (129) having one end thereof mounted on

said shutter opening and closing means (45) and the other end
thereof mounted on said misinsertion detection means (48).
A disc cartridge misinsertion preventing mechanism
according to claim 2, wherein said misinsertion detection means
