<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas barrier films,
and more particularly to films which are formed from a
mixture containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and a partially
neutralized product of poly(meth)acrylic acid, insoluble
in water, excellent in oxygen gas barrier property, and
scarcely colored, and a production process thereof. The
films according to the present invention are excellent in
water resistance and oxygen gas barrier property and free
of any chlorine atom, and are hence suitable for use as
food packaging materials.A PVA film is generally formed by a casting process
making use of water as a solvent, or an extrusion process.
The PVA film features that it is flexible and antistatic,
and moreover has the best oxygen gas barrier property
among general synthetic resin films in a dry state.
Therefore, the use of the PVA film has heretofore been
intended to develop to the field of packaging materials,
for which good oxygen gas barrier property is required,
making good use of this gas barrier property. However,
the oxygen gas barrier property of the PVA film greatly 
depends on humidity and are hence impaired to a great
extent due to moisture absorption under high-humidity
conditions. Further, the PVA film is easy to dissolve in
boiling water.A PVA film has hitherto been used in the form of a
laminate film of a multi-layer structure having at least
two layers of the PVA film and another film when using it
for a purpose in which practical oxygen gas barrier
property is required, whereby the influence of humidity
has been lessened as much as possible. In the method
forming the laminate film, however, moisture resistance
and water resistance are still insufficient. There are
thus demands for improving the water resistance of the PVA
itself and allowing the PVA film to satisfactorily keep
the good oxygen gas barrier property even under high-humidity
conditions.In order to solve the above problems involved in the
PVA film, various investigations such as, for example,
those described below have heretofore been made.It has been known to convert hydroxyl groups in PVA
into a form of acetal with aldehydes. However, this
method has a disadvantage that although water insolubility
can be imparted to PVA, the oxygen gas barrier property of
the resulting films is markedly lowered if absorbing 
water.In U.S. Patent No. 2,169,250, it has been proposed
to form films and fibers from an aqueous mixture
solution containing PVA and a polycarboxylic acid, and
heat the formed products to react the hydroxyl groups in
PVA
