<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in
general, to a motility stimulating peptide and
compositions comprising the same. In particular, the
present invention relates to a purified form of the
peptide, for example, autotaxin (ATX); a DNA segment
encoding autotaxin; recombinant DNA molecules
containing the DNA segment; cells containing the
recombinant DNA molecule; a method of producing
autotaxin; antibodies to autotaxin; and methods of
cancer diagnosis and therapy using the above
referenced peptides and DNA segments.Cell motility plays an important role in
embryonic events, adult tissue remodeling, wound
healing, angiogenesis, immune defense, and
metastasis of tumor cells (Singer, S.J. and Kupfer,
A. (1986) Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 2, 337-365). In
normal physiologic processes, motility is tightly
regulated. On the other hand, tumor cell motility
may be aberrantly regulated or autoregulated. Tumor
cells can respond in a motile fashion to a variety
of agents. These include host-derived factors such
as scatter factor (Rosen, E.M. et al., (1989) In
Vitro Cell Devel. Biol. 25, 163-173) and growth
factors (Kahan, B.W. et al., (1987) Cancer Res. 47,
6324-6328; Stracke, M.L. et al., Biochem. Biophys.
Res. Comm. 153, 1076-1083; Tamm, I., et al., (1989) 
J. Exp. Med. 170, 1649-1669; Wang, J.M., et al.
(1990) Biochem. Bipohys. Res. Comm. 169, 165-170;
and Jouanneau, J., et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 88, 2893-2897), components of the
extracellular matrix (McCarthy, J.B., et al. (1984)
J. Cell Biol. 98, 1474-1480), and tumor-secreted or
autocrine factors (Liotta, L.A., et al. (1988)
Cancer Surveys 7, 631-652; Ruff, M., et al. (1985)
Clin. Immunol. Immunopath. 37, 387-396; Atnip, K.D.,
et al. (1987) Biochem. Biochys. Res. Comm. 146, 996-1002;
Ohnishi, T., et al. (1990) J. Neurosurg. 73,
881-888; Silletti, S., et al. (1991) Cancer Res. 51,
3507-3511.; and Watanabe, H., et al. (1991) J. Biol.
Chem. 266, 13442-13448).Many types of host-derived soluble factors
act in a paracrine fashion to stimulate cell
locomotion. Motility-stimulating proteins called
"scatter factors" have been identified which are
produced by embryonic fibroblasts and by smooth
muscle cells (Stoker, M., et al. (1987) Nature 327,
239-242). Scatter factors stimulate random and
directed motility by epithelial cells,
keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells and
carcinoma cells (Stoker, M., et al. (1987) Nature
327, 239-242; Rosen, E.M., et al. (1990) Proc. Soc.
Exp. Biol. Med. 195, 34-43; and Weidner, K.M., et
al. (1990) J. Cell. Biol. 111, 2097-2108),
