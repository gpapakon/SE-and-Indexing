<ABSTRACT>
In drainage systems in buildings and excavations there is waste and ground water with a high dissolved material content. These mainly inorganic substances often cause the build-up of hard deposits in the water conveying parts of the drainage systems, e.g. waste water pipes. These deposits reduce the drainage cross section of the drainage systems thus preventing the water from flowing freely and thus causing back-ups which can result in considerable damage. The current processes for removing these deposits are electro-mechanical cleaning and high-pressure rinsing or abrading with water. These processes are laborious, expensive and cause interruptions in operation. It is the aim of the invention to prevent the formation of such deposits. To this end, a conditioning agent in aqueous form is added via a metering installation at one or more points in the drainage system. The conditioning agent is mixed with the water arriving at the next channel and prevents the dissolved substances from separating out and causing deposits.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preventing the formation of deposits in drainage systems
of tunnel structures, barrages, retention basins or hydroelectric power plants,


characterized in that
 one or more conditioning agents selected from the group
consisting of N-containing phosphonates, in particular aminoalkylenephosphoric

acids, phosphonocarboxylic acids, succinic acid amide, polysaccharides,
polyoxycarboxylic acids and their copolymers, proteins, in particular

polyaspartic acid, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyacrylamides, copolymers
of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and acrylamide, sulfomethylated or

sulfoethylated polyacrylamides and copolymers or terpolymers with acrylic acid
and maleic acid esters, maleic acid anhydride polymers and copolymers and

ethercarboxylates, are added from a dosage unit (16) via a feed line (15) into
the drainage system at the highest point of the seepage pipe (13) in the form of

an aqueous solution in an amount of from 0.1 to 100 g/m
3
 of infiltration or
ground water in dependence on the amount of water present at the end of the

drainage system. 
The process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the conditioning
agent(s) is (are) added in an amount of from 0.5 to 50 g/m
3
 of infiltration or
ground water.
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in
that
 a dosage unit (16) having a service water inlet (14) to enable the conditioning
agent to be diluted in any ratio with service water for subsequent feeding

into the drainage system is used.
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 further additives are added to the infiltration or ground water.
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
that
 a mixture of phosphonocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids in the
form of their water-soluble salts is added to the infiltration or ground water in

the form of an aqueous solution in amounts of from 0.50 to 50 g/m
3
 of infiltration
or ground water.
