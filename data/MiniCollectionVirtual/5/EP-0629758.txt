<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a remote-control system for actuating units in a motor vehicle. According to the invention, a shaping circuit (202) exhibits a threshold level set as a function of a predetermined functional range area so as to enable a function ordered by the sender only if the latter is within the said functional range area.

<CLAIMS>
Remote-control system for actuating electromechanical
members in a motor vehicle, comprising:


a portable sender (10) for sending coded signals, the
said sender comprising a set of function keys (102),
a receiving module (20) placed in the vehicle, comprising
a processor (203) for processing the coded signals

received, and a circuit for processing electromechanical
members of the vehicle (204),
characterised in that
 the processor (203) is programmed
in such a way that the same key or combination of keys

of the portable sender (10) makes it possible to trigger
several different functions depending on the area

around the vehicle in which the sender is located.
Remote-control system according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 the processor (203) includes a
circuit for formatting demodulated signals (202), incorporating

a means for control of the threshold for
detection of the signals of the said circuit (202), so

as to define several functional-range areas around the
vehicle.
Remote-control system according to Claim 2,

characterised in that
 a key or combination of keys activated
in a functional area close to the vehicle makes

it possible to control functions of a security nature,
such as locking/unlocking, whereas the activation of

this same key or combination of keys in a functional
area remote from the vehicle makes it possible to control

user-friendliness functions.
Remote-control system according to Claim [sic] 1

to 3, 
characterised in that
 the sender (10) transmits a
coded signal formed from at least two parts the first

of which is intended to allow identification of the
sender (10) and the second of which is intended to allow 

detection of the level of the signals received by
the receiving module (20).
Remote-control system according to Claim [sic] 1

to 3, 
characterised in that
 the processor (203) includes
a means for switching over the detection threshold

of the formatting circuit (202), in response to the
reception and to the decoding of the first part so as

to determine in which area around the vehicle the
sender is located.
Remote-control system according to Claim 5,

characterised in that
 the processor (203) drives the
detection threshold by default to its low level, and 
in
that
 the detection threshold switches over successively
from a low level to the next high level.
