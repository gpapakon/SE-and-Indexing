<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control for a heating device and a heating device with a control, preferably to a bathroom radiator with an electric or electronic circuit, with at least one temperature-measuring device, with a regulating device for controlling an energy flow, in particular electric current, which can be converted into heating power, and also with a heating apparatus, preferably a heating element or a heating cartridge, in which arrangement, according to the invention, at least one throttling device for reducing or cutting off the flow of the heating medium is disposed in the supply and/or return of the heating device and the circuit opens, throttles or cuts off the supply and return of the heating medium from and to a central heating system by means of the throttling device as a function of a preset target temperature for the heating device and as a function of the temperature of the heating medium which can be detected in the supply of the heating device, the circuit cutting off the supply and/or the return of the heating medium by means of the throttling device to and from the central heating sytem if the supply temperature falls below a set temperature value.

<CLAIMS>
A control device for a radiator, preferably a bathroom 
radiator (10), 


having an electric or electronic circuit (32), 
having at least one temperature measurement device 
(28) for the room temperature, 
having a regulating device for controlling an energy 

flow, in particular electric current, which can be 
converted into calorific output, with an electric 

heating device, preferably an electric heating bar 
or an electric heating cartridge (24), 
having at least one throttling device for opening or 
interrupting the flow of the heating medium for 

arrangement in the supply and/or return (14, 16) of 
the radiator (10); 
the circuit (32) causes the opening or interruption 
of the supply and/or return of the heating medium 

from or respectively to a central heating system by 
means of the throttling device (18), 
characterised by
 the following features: 

a) the circuit (32) may also cause a throttling of the 
supply and/or return of the heating medium from or 

respectively to the central heating system by means 
of the throttling device, with the opening, 

interruption or throttling operation occurring in 
dependence on a preset set or target room 

temperature for the radiator (10) and in dependence 
on the temperature of the heating medium at the 

supply of the radiator (10) via a further 
temperature measurement device (22) to be disposed 

there; 
b) the circuit (32) controls the supply and/or the 
return of the heating medium by means of the 

throttling device (18, 20) to or respectively from  
 

the central heating system (12) when the supply 
temperature drops below a predetermined temperature 

value. 
A control device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 an input device (36) is provided to 
input control parameters, in particular the target or set 

room temperature. 
A control device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the control device can be connected 
to a battery and/or to the power supply and a monitoring 

circuit is preferably provided, which indicates when the 
battery is run down to a predetermined value, and if 

necessary switches over to the power supply in order to 
charge the battery and preferably keeps the control 

device operative. 
A control device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the present control signals can be 
repeated by the control device after the expiry of a 

predetermined time interval so as to minimise 
disturbances. 
A control device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the heating device or respectively 
the heating bar is provided with zones of varying 

calorific output or respectively varying resistance in 
its longitudinal direction, with the calorific output or 

respectively the resistance preferably increasing in one 
direction. 
A control device according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 a pressure equalisation tank is 
connected to the radiator (10).  

 
A radiator (10), preferably a bathroom radiator, having 
a control device, with the following features: 


an electric or electronic circuit (32), 
at least one temperature measurement device (38), 
a regulating device to control a flow of energy, in 
particular electric current, which can be converted 

into calorific output, with an electric heating 
device, preferably an electric heating bar or an 

electric heating cartridge (24), 
a throttling device for opening or interrupting the 
flow of the heating medium, which is disposed in the 

supply and/or return (14, 16) of the radiator (10); 
the circuit (32) brings about the opening or 
interruption of the supply and/or return of the 

heating medium from or respectively to a central 
heating system by means of the throttling device 

(18), 
characterised by
 the following features: 

a) the circuit (32) may also bring about a throttling 
of the supply and/or return of the heating medium 

from or respectively to the central heating system 
by means of the throttling device, with the opening, 

interruption or throttling operation occurring in 
dependence on a preset set or target room 

temperature for the radiator (10) and in dependence 
on the temperature of the heating medium at the 

supply of the radiator (10) via a further 
temperature measurement device (22) disposed there; 
b) the circuit (32) controls the supply and/or return 
of the heating medium by means of the throttling 

device (18, 20) to or respectively from the central 
heating system (12) when the supply temperature 

drops below a predetermined temperature value. 
A heating device according to Claim 7,
characterised by
 a control device having the features 
according to one of Claims 2 to 6.
