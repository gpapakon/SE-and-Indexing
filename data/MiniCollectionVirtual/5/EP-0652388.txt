<ABSTRACT>
This device (1) comprises several tubular wall elements (2, 3, 2', 3') which flare out in their axial direction (XX') and are fitted one inside the other, and are placed head-to-tail so that the non-flared end edge of one element is bearing against the flared end edge of the adjacent element. Equipment for vehicles, particularly motor vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Shock absorber device comprising several tubular wall 
members (2, 3, 2', 3') flaring in their axial direction 

and nesting one inside the other, characterised by the 
fact that said members are placed top to bottom such 

that the edge of the non-flared end of one member is 
resting against the edge of the flared end of the 

adjacent member, the common axis of the tubular wall 
members (X, X') forming the axis of rotation of the 

device and being oriented substantially in the 
direction of the envisaged shock (F), such that said 

wall members work in compression while they are being 
crushed. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact 
that the outer member (2) flares in the direction of 

the envisaged shock (F). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised 
by the fact that the stack of wall members is provided 

at at least one of its ends with a closing plate (70, 
71). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
by the fact that the assembly of wall members 

constitutes a one-piece unit, produced for example by 
swaging sheet metal. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
by the fact that the various wall members are fixed 

together at their adjacent edges, by bonding or 
welding. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
by the fact that the assembly of wall members are of 

the same length.  
 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
by the fact that all the wall members are not of the 

same length. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterised by the fact 
that it is provided with wedges (8, 8') for holding the 

stack. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
by the fact that it contains filling material (9). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
by the fact that at least one of the wall members has 

means for monitoring its deformation, for example, 
openings (11, 12). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised by the fact that the wall members are in 

the shape of a truncated cone. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised by the fact that the assembly of wall 

members have the same conicity. 
Device according to Claim 11 or 12 intended for an 
automotive application, characterised by the fact that 

the angle at the vertex (u, u', v, v') of the wall 
members is comprised between 10 and 60 degrees, 

preferably between 10 and 30 degrees. 
Device according to Claim 12, characterised by the fact 
that the assembly of wall members are produced by 

cutting up a single tube in the shape of a truncated 
cone.
