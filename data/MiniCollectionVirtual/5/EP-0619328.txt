<ABSTRACT>
There is a need for polymers which are utilized 
in automotive interiors which offer increased heat and 

ultraviolet light resistance. It is particularly 
critical for polymers which are utilized in making 

skin compounds for automotive instrument and door 
panels to display excellent heat and ultraviolet light 

resistance. This invention discloses a rubbery 
polymer which can be blended with polyvinyl chloride 

to make leathery compositions having good heat and 
ultraviolet light resistance, said rubbery polymer 

being comprised of repeat units which are comprised of 
(a) butyl acrylate, or optionally a mixture of butyl 

acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate containing up to 
about 40% 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, (b) at least one 

member selected from the group consisting of methyl 
methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, and 

ethyl acrylate, (c) acrylonitrile, (d) styrene, (e) a 
half ester maleate soap, and (f) a crosslinking agent. 

Such leathery compositions offer an excellent 
combination of properties for utilization in making 

skin compounds for panels used in automotive 
applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
Automotive instrument panels and door panels are 
typically composites which are made of a rigid backing 
which supports a semi-rigid urethane foam with the 
semi-rigid urethane foam being covered with a skin 
compound. Such skin compounds are typically blends of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with a nitrile rubber (NBR). 
The nitrile rubber is included in such blends as a 
permanent modifier for the PVC which provides it with 
a higher degree of flexibility. The automotive industry is currently moving 
toward more aerodynamic body designs which typically 
include larger glass areas. Such design changes have 
significantly increased the heat and ultraviolet light 
aging requirements of automotive interiors. This has 
in turn significantly increased the demands put upon 
the polymers which are utilized as skins in automotive 
interior panels. Heat and light stabilizers can be employed to 
improve the heat and ultraviolet light aging 
characteristics of conventional PVC/NBR blends which 
are utilized as skins for automotive interior panels. 
However, the degree to which the aging characteristics 
of such blends can be improved by the addition of 
additives is limited. In fact, there is a demand for 
performance characteristics in such applications which 
heretofore has not been realized by the utilization of 
heat and light stabilizers. For instance, it would be 
highly desirable for the skins used in automotive 
panels to resist discoloration and cracking under 
conditions of high heat and intense ultraviolet light 
throughout the life of the vehicle. NBR/PVC blends offer an array of physical 
properties which make them useful as a skin  
 
composition for automotive panels. The NBR acts as a 
permanent flexibilizing monomer for the PVC. It also 
acts as a shrinkage control agent, and embossing aid, 
and improves grain retention. The NBR in such blends 
further provides vacuum forming gauge control and 
exhibits low fog characteristics. NBR is highly 
compatible with PVC and has the capability of being 
recycled. It is essential for any polymer which is 
substituted for NBR to display these essential 
characteristics. The present invention relates to a rubbery 
polymer which can be blended with PVC to make leathery 
compositions. These compositions are particularly 
useful in manufacturing skins for automotive interior 
panelling. Skin compositions which are made utilizing 
this rubbery polymer provide a higher level of 
resistance to heat and ultraviolet light than those 
made utilizing conventional NBR/PVC
