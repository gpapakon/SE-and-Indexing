<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
as set out in appended claims 1 - 18
for
preparing porous spherical silica particles as set out in claim 19
substantially consisting in emulsifying an acidic
silica sol in a dispersing media, gelifying the
microdrops of the sol in the emulsified state and
submitting the resulting gel to heat treatment in the
presence of the emulsifying liquid and of the sol
gelation base; the invention also relates to the so
obtained silica xerogels with spherical shape, which
can find wide applications as catalyst carriers such
as, e.g., the suitable catalysts for olefin
polymerization; in particular, the spherical shape of
the particles combined with a narrow distribution of
diameters is particularly suitable for carrying out
catalytic processes in gas phase on fluidized bed.Finally, silica xerogels characterized by a
specific surface area comprised within the range of
from 200 to 600 m2/g, by a pore volume of >1 cm3/g and
a pore diameter comprised within the range of from 80
to 250 Å (Ångstrom), with such xerogels being useable
as carriers for catalytic systems for olefin
polymerization, are a further object of the present
invention.These and still other features of the invention
will become clearer from the following disclosure.The process for preparing porous spherical silica
particles according to the present invention
essentially comprises the following steps: 
(A) preparing a colloidal silica solution by
hydrolizing a silicon alkoxide in an aqueous
media in the presence of mineral or organic
acids;(B) possibly dispersing of fumed silica in the
colloidal silica solution prepared as disclosed
under (A);(C) mixing the pure (A) or hybrid (B) silica sol in
an organic media constituted by higher alcohols
having 8 or more carbon atoms;(D) emulsifying the so obtained mixture;(E) gelifying the pure or hybrid silica sol by
bringing the above obtained emulsion with a basic
solution constituted by the emulsifying liquid
containing dissolved inorganic bases (e.g.,
ammonia) or, preferably, organic bases, such as,
e.g., amines;(F) heat treatment (T>50°C) of the gel in the form of
spherical particles, in the presence of the
emulsifying liquid and of the sol gelifying base;
the so obtained product is finally submitted to
finishing treatments, such as: filtration,
washing, drying and calcination at a temperature
of >400°C under an oxidizing atmosphere.It is well known that the granulometric
characteristics of particles with spherical shape, in
particular their average diameter and
