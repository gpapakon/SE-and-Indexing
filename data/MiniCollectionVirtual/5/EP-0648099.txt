<ABSTRACT>
Device including at least three transmitters (S1-S8) and at least two receivers (R1-R3) fitted to the part of the organ to be analyzed, to a data acquisition camera, and/or to a plotting probe and/or to a stationary support, a pulse clock (18) connected to a pulse generator (19) causing the different transmitters (S1-S8) to emit in sequence, and to the receivers (R1-R3) in order to indicate to which transmitter corresponds the received signal, a converter (20) for transforming the information received by each probe into a numerical value, a computer (22-23) for determining the coordinates of each transmitter in relation to each receiver, storing the information according to each image, and deriving, based on one of the images serving as a reference, correlations of each image in relation to the reference image, in order to obtain a three-dimensional image of an organ. Application in odontology.
