<ABSTRACT>
This device includes: a plurality of access terminals (1701 to 1705) for users having information to transmit to a certain destination with a certain data rate, at least one connecting terminal (201) for one of the points of access to the said network, a plurality of service circuits (C1 to CM) equipped with queueing elements (205, 3051 ... 305p-1) for storing user data, a common data line (200) interconnecting the data outputs of the said service circuits with the said connection terminal. It further includes: a unit (210) for allocating access time to the said common line (200) for the queueing elements, equipped with an allocation table (212) containing destination codes defining the destinations, distributed according to the data rate to be transmitted and with a table reading unit (217) for picking up the said destination codes at a defined rate, and a decoding assembly (410) for analysing the said destination codes in order to control access by the data line to the queueing element involved with one of the said codes. Application to A.T.M. networks.
