<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOLOGICAL ANALOGS FOR CAPTANFIELD OF THE INVENTION Hydrolytically stable immunological analogs for captan and captafol.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Standard for use in testing for captan.Environmental testing requirements call for the determination of lo levels of the fungicide captan and the related captafol. These compounds a readily hydrolyzed and thus unstable in aqueous media. This instability makes very difficult to devise standards for detecting small amounts of these materia by immunoassay. Captan has the structure THPD-S-CCI3 and captafol has t structure THPD-S-CCI2-CH.CI2, wherein THPD is the cis-1 .2.3. tetrahydrophthalimido moiety. In order to carry out immunoassay tests f captan, which type of assay is most useful in detecting very small amounts of unknown material, it would be necessary to provide a water stable analog captan which is reactive with the antibody used in the method. It has been fou by the work disclosed and claimed herein, that such a standard can be provid by a material having the structureTHPD-(CH2)x-(R3)y-R1 (I) wherein THPD is cjs_-1 ,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimido, x is an integer from 1 to 1 R selected from the group consisting of -COOH, -NH2, -N02, -SH and -OH, R3 an aryl moiety and y is 0 or 1. Several compounds within this general structu wherein R1 is carboxyl are reported in the literature, in particular those where x has the value 2, 1 , 3, and 5. The method of synthesis involves t condensation of tetrahydrophthalic anhydride with an equimolar amount of t corresponding amino alkanoic acid. The literature however appears to be sile on any immunological relationship between compounds of formula (I) and capt or captafol.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There is provided a standard for use in testing for captan in immunoassays. This standard has the structureTHPD-tCH^-tR^y-R (I) wherein THPD is cjs_-1 ,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimido, x is an integer from 1 to 10, R1 selected from the group consisting of -COOH, -NH2, -NO2, -SH and -OH, R3 is an aryl moiety and Î³ is 0 or 1. Compounds of this general structure are known, but heretofore it has not been known that in an immunoassay they mimic the immunological reaction of captans which are not stable in water and thus cannot be satisfactorily used as standards in testing for the presence and level of presence of captans.There is also provided a method of carrying out such testing, utilizing such standards. In this methodology the standard (I) is coupled to a large protein, that is to say one large enough to
