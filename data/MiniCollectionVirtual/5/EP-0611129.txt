<ABSTRACT>
Substrate material is molded directly to semiconductor 
chips (14) and other electrical components (20) that are positioned for 

integrated circuit module fabrication. Chips (14) having contact pads 
are placed face down on a layer of adhesive supported by a base (10). A 

mold form is positioned around the chips. Substrate molding 
material (24) is added within the mold form, and the substrate 

molding material (24) is then hardened. A dielectric layer (12) 
having vias 

aligned with predetermined ones of the contact pads and having 
an electrical conductor extending through the vias is situated on 

the hardened substrate molding material (24) and the faces of the 
chips (14). A thermal plug (34) may be affixed to the backside of a chip 

(14) before substrate molding material (24) is added. A connector frame 
may be placed on the adhesive layer before substrate molding 

material is added. A dielectric layer may be placed over the 
backsides of the chips before the substrate molding material is 

added to enhance repairability. A portion of the chips (14) and 
substrate molding material (24) may be removed after the substrate 

molding material (24) is hardened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fabrication of substrates
for multi-chip modules and other integrated circuit modules, and,
more particularly, to fabrication of a substrate for an integrated
circuit module by molding material around semiconductor chips,
except for chip surfaces containing contact pads.Conventional high density interconnect (HDI) processes
often use cavities formed into a substrate base for the placement of
chips so that the top surfaces of the chips are essentially planar
with the surface of the substrate. The substrate is generally a
ceramic or a composite structure. The conventional HDI
technique for fabricating cavities in the substrate is to
mechanically machine or mill out the cavity material with a
computer-controlled diamond tooled bit. This time consuming
process does not always provide the desired chip cavity depth and
can result in cracks which render the substrate unusable. In the conventional HDI process, chips are placed into
cavities on multiple drops of die attach adhesive for mechanical,
thermal, and electrical mounting. Chips placed with this process
often are displaced during further processing because there are
non-uniform surface tension forces at the chip-to-die attach
adhesive inter-face. This displacement reduces precision in chip
location, and further processing steps are required to adapt each
electrical interconnection to the chip misalignment.Eichelberger, U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,769, issued Feb. 25, 1992,
describes an integrated circuit package formed by placing
integrated circuit chips backside down on a substrate,
encapsulating the faces and sides of the chips, fabricating vias
and interconnections through the encapsulant to the contact pads
for testing and burn in procedures, and removing the encapsulant
after testing. When chips of differing thicknesses are used in a
single multi-chip module (MCM), their pads are not situated in a
common plane, so this method requires either that some of the
chips be thinned or that the vias be of varying depths.
Additionally, this technique involves a step of mechanical
grinding for planarizing the surface and the use of an
encapsulant material which is removed after testing. C.-L. Chen et al. IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids and Manufacturing
Technology 15(4), 451 (1992) discloses an integrated circuit module, comprising a
plurality of chips, each of said chips having a face side and a backside, and contact pads
located on said face sides on a common plane, hardened substrate molding material
