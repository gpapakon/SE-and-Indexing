<ABSTRACT>
A hull structure of nonmetallic material, in 
particular of a reinforced plastics material, for boats, 

ships, minesweepers and the like, comprises a preferably 
one-piece shell (1) and at least one deck (2, 2') and has 

a plurality of ribs (3) which are distributed along the 
length of the hull and extend across the corresponding 

transverse section of said shell (1) and a plurality of 
transverse members (4, 4') (known as beams) which extend 

directly underneath the deck (2, 2'). In order to give 
the hull greater structural strength and make it lighter, 

the invention provides that each transverse rib (3) 
joined to the shell (1) is connected (103, 203) to a 

corresponding transverse member (4, 4') joined to the 
deck (2, 2') and to continuous fore and aft members (15) 

(girders) passing in the manner of bulkheads, so as to 
form a single one-piece frame with the keel member. The 

invention achieves the aforesaid object to a still 
greater degree by means of additional improvements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hull structure of nonmetallic
material, in particular of a reinforced plastics material,
for boats, ships, minesweeper and the like, which structure
comprises a preferably one-piece shell and at least one deck
and has a plurality of ribs which are distributed along the
length of the hull and extend across the corresponding
transverse section of said shell, and a plurality of
transverse beam members which extend directly underneath the
deck and in which hull structure, according to the preamble
of claim 1:
a) in each transverse rib joined to the shell is
connected to a corresponding transverse beam member joined
to the deck so as to form a single one-piece frame, with
fore and aft members situated underneath the forecastle
deck, upper deck and 'tween deck,b) the transverse ribs extend across the entire
transverse section of the shell and are connected at their
free upper ends to the members joined to the upper deck,c) there are a plurality of decks one above the other,
to each of which a plurality of transverse members are
joined, one transverse member of each respective deck being
connected to each individual tranverse rib.
A hull structure of this kind is known from the
document: Transactions of the SNAME, Vol. 73, 1965, pages 
428-430; K. Spaulding "Fiberglass Reinforeced Plastic
Minesweepers", Figures 7, 8 and 9.Engine rooms bounded by vertical bulkheads wherein the
engines are suspended by annular engine cradles and fixed to
the bulkheads and to the deck are per se known from the
document GB-A-2161773, in which are shown also annular beams
surrounding a deck opening. The hull structure known from
the document GB-A-2161773 is however a metallic structure
and constructively different from the hull structure
according to the preamble of claim 1.The object of the invention is to provide a hull
structure of the above-described type, which by means of an
extremely simple structural design has greater structural
strength and less weight without affecting the qualities of
the hull made of nonmetallic material, in particular of
reinforced plastics materials.The invention achieves the above objects with a hull
structure of the above described type, characterized -
according to the characterizing part of claim 1 - by the
combination of the following features:d) the hull structure comprises an engine room which is
bounded by vertical bulkheads, while each engine is
suspended by an annular engine cradle fixed to the bulkheads
and to a deck overhead which forms the upper surface of the
