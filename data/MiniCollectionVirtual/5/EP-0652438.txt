<ABSTRACT>
Seal (gasket) for (rolling) bearing with data sensor, in which a fixed ring and a rotating ring have races (rolling tracks) in contact with rolling bodies and in which the rotating ring carries an encoder element mounted so as to move in front of a data sensor element (6) carried by the said seal (7) having an internal reinforcement (8) and mounted on the fixed ring (1) of the bearing, characterised in that the sensor element (6) is in contact with an insulating film (11) carrying conductive tracks and electronic elements mounted jointly on the reinforcement (8) and covered by the constituent material of the seal.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing gasket for an information sensor bearing in which a fixed 
ring (1) and a rotary ring (2) comprise raceways in contact with rolling bodies (3) 

and in which the rotary ring (2) bears an encoding member (5) mounted to run in 
front of an information sensor member (6) borne by the sealing gasket (7) with an 

inner armature (8) mounted on the fixed ring (1) of the bearing, characterised in that 
the sensor member (6) is in contact with an insulating film (11) bearing conducting 

tracks (12) and electronic components mounted jointly on the armature (8) and 
covered by the material forming the gasket. 
A sealing gasket as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
conducting tracks (12) are connected, on the one hand, to at least one exposed Hall 

member and, on the other hand, via connection terminals (13), to a supply cable (14). 
A sealing gasket as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the 
armature (8) has a cut-out port (17) located in the vicinity of the insulating film (11) 

in order to enable the passage of cable and connection means. 
A sealing gasket as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the edge 
of the armature port (17) is adjacent to a tongue (20) formed by cutting out from the 

port and covered by the insulating film (11) bearing the conducting tracks (12). 
A sealing gasket as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the 
connection means are formed by lateral pins (18). 
A sealing gasket as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the material forming the gasket locally coats the cable and connection means 

(14, 18). 
A sealing gasket as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that one of its 
surfaces bears a lateral connection bushing (25). 
An information sensor bearing, in which a fixed ring (1) and a rotary 
ring (2) comprise raceways in contact with rolling bodies (3) and in which the rotary 

ring (2) bears an encoding member (5) mounted to run in front of an information 
sensor member (6) borne by the sealing gasket (7) with an inner armature (8) 

mounted on the fixed ring (1) of the bearing, as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7.
