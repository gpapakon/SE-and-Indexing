<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistive head includes a magnetoresistive 
element (22) set back from the front end face of the 

head confronting a record medium for converting changes 
in a signal magnetic field leaking out from the record 

track (35) of the record medium (34) into changes in resistance. 
The magnetoresistive element is connected to a pair of 

terminals (28a,28b) and a sense region (22a) is defined between both the 
terminals. The magnetoresistive element is magnetically 

coupled to a front flux guide (24), one end of which is exposed 
in the front end face of the head, at the other end 

of the same. The front flux guide is virtually in the 
form of a rectangle elongated in the direction of the 

width of the record track of the record medium so as to 
exceed the sense region of the magnetoresistive element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin-film
magnetic head for use in magnetic recording and reproducing
apparatus such as magnetic disk apparatus and magnetic
tape apparatus and, more particularly, relates to a
magnetoresistive head for reproducing recorded information
on a record medium by the magnetoresistive effect.Recently, with the advancement in magnetic disk
apparatus smaller in size and higher in density, there
are demands for implementation of contact
recording/reproduction during which the head slider has a
reduced flying height, i.e., the slider floats above a
record medium very little or the slider contacts the
record medium.When the velocity of a magnetic disk (relative
velocity between the head and medium) is decreased according
as the magnetic disk is made smaller in diameter,
a conventional magnetic inductive head reproduces a
deteriorated output. Therefore, a magnetoresistive head
(hereinafter briefly referred to as "MR head") which 
reproduces an output not dependent on the velocity and
provides a high power output even when the disk is rotated
at low velocity is desired to be developed.An MR head supplies a constant sense current to
a magnetoresistive element to convert changes in magnitude
of a signal magnetic field leaked out from the
record track of a record medium into changes in resistance
and thereby reproduces information recorded on the
record medium as changes in voltage. In conventional MR
heads, a magnetoresistive element has been exposed in the
surface of the head confronting the medium. Therefore,
the recording and reproducing through very low flying
height or contacting have been very difficult to realize
while using a combination of such a head and a metallic
record medium because of a short or discharge occurring
in between.Accordingly, the present inventors proposed in
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Hei 5-114119 a
flux-guided type magnetoresistive head in such an arrangement
that the magnetoresistive element is not exposed
in the surface of the head confronting the medium
and a leakage magnetic field from the medium is guided by
a flux guide formed of a soft magnetic material to the
magnetoresistive element. The MR head disclosed in the above laid-open
patent publication includes a magnetoresistive element of
Ni-Fe set back from the front end face of the head confronting
a record medium and a pair of terminals connected
with the magnetoresistive element defining a sense
region of the magnetoresistive element therebetween, and
a constant sense current is
