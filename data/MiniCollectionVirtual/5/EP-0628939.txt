<ABSTRACT>
A multi-lane monitoring system provides identification of vehicles in all lanes. The system has a scanning sensor system mounted on a tower (2l) that covers a diagonal area (3l). A similar scanner (25) is mounted on the other side. Cameras photograph the front (4r, 4l) and the rear (5r, 5l). The combination of sensor signals and camera information allows vehicles in each of the lanes to be identified.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the unequivocal assignment of non-positional
measurement results obtained with a first measuring set-up (2) from

multi-lane road measurements, to individual vehicles at different
locations, where further non-positional measurements are performed

with at least a second measuring set-up (2l) with which the same
ambiguities cannot occur, so as to determine the location of the

vehicle to which the respective measurement refers.
A set-up for the unequivocal assignment of measurement
results from multilane road (1) measurements to individual vehicles

at different locations, with a measuring set-up (2r, 4r) which is
able to perform non-positional measurements in every travel lane

(1r, 1m, 1l), but is unable to assign these unequivocally when two
or more vehicles appear simultaneously, characterized in that a

second measuring set-up (2l, 4l) is available, which is also able
to perform non-positional measurements of vehicles in every travel

lane, and is also unable to assign these unequivocally when two or
more vehicles appear simultaneously, and that the type and the

reciprocal configuration of the two measuring set-ups is chosen so
that the same ambiguities cannot occur with the two measuring set-ups

(2r, 4r; l, 4l), in order to determine the location of the
vehicle to which the respective measurement refers.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the
(fist) measurements and the subsequent measurements are of the same

type, but differ from each other by the configuration of the
measuring set-up.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the
measurements consist of vehicle identity determinations. 
A set-up as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the
(first) and the second measuring set-ups are of the same type, but

measure from different sides of the street.
A set-up as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the
measuring set-ups also contain devices for acquiring vehicle

identities.
A set-up as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the
measuring set-ups also contain cameras (4r, 4l) for determining

vehicle locations.
