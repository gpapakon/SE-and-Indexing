<ABSTRACT>
A can has a bottom (16), a casing (12) and a lid (14). An opening member (18) is arranged on the lid (14) or on the casing (12) near the lid (14) and a second opening member (18) is arranged on the bottom (16) or on the casing (12) near the bottom (16). Both opening members (18) are identically designed as known ring-pull opening members (18) or tear-off strip opening members (18), so that the bottom (16) and the lid (14) may be completely or largely detached from the casing (12) with little effort and the casing (12) open at both ends may be squeezed with little effort.

<CLAIMS>
Can with a base (16), a casing (12) and a top (14), wherein the base (16) and the top (14) 
close off the casing (12) above and below and wherein the can (10) features at the top (14), or on 

the casing (12) in the vicinity of the top, an opening device (18), and at the base (16), or on the 
casing (12) in the vicinity of the babe (16), a second opening device (18), whereby the first and 

second opening devices are identically designed, and by this can (10) is characterised as a tin 
can and that the two opening devices (18) are designed as familiar ring-pull opening devices with 

an in-built suitable breaking line (25) on the outer periphery of the base (16) and of the top (14), in 
such a way that the base (16) and the top (14) are completely or extensively removable from the 

casing (12) with minimum of effort and that the casing (12) having been opened at both ends can 
be folded up with minimum of effort. 
Can in accordance with the specifications of Claim 1, and by this the can (10) is characterised 
as a tin can and that the two opening devices (18) on the casing (12) in the vicinity of the base 

(16) and of the top (14) are designed as familiar tear-off strip-opening devices with a tear-off 
strip 

(26) running around the casing (12), in such a way that the base (16) and the top (14) are 
completely or extensively removable from the casing (12) with minimum of effort and that the 

casing (12) having been opened at both ends can be folded up with minimum of effort.
