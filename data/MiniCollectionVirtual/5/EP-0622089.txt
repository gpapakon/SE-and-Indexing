<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
implantable pacing lead for use with a cardiac 
pacemaker, and more specifically, to a pacing lead 
having lead body wherein the conductors are protected 
from being crushed by the subclavian bone and muscle 
structure. Clinical evidence suggests that certain upper 
extremity activities are contraindicated for persons 
with permanent pacemakers because they require 
movements that can cause damage to leads. Currently, 
leads used in cardiac stimulation are often implanted 
transvenously or transthoracically with the result 
that the lead body can be physically crushed by either 
bones (i.e. "first rib-clavicle") or by tissue 
(costoclavicular ligament complex, subclavius muscle) 
and by anchoring sleeves which are tied-down so 
tightly that the lead body can be crushed or damaged. 
The result of these crushing or constrictive stresses 
can be severe damage to the conductors within the lead 
body which, in turn, can result in failed conductors 
and/or failed insulation. Some leads and central venous catheters placed by 
percutaneous subclavian venipuncture have developed a 
number or problems that are apparently associated with 
the costoclavicular region near the superior thoracic 
aperture. Catheters or leads implanted by subclavian 
venipuncture can be damaged by bony compression or 
impingement by dense tissues as the lead passes 
through the vein beneath the clavicle, over the first 
rib, and into the thorax just lateral to the 
sternoclavicular joint. Studies suggest that an  
 
overriding clavicle can crush leads against the first 
rib with a "pincherlike" action. Leads can also be 
compressed within the costoclavicular ligament 
complex. Conductor mechanical damage including fractures 
and/or insulation breaks occur in about 2% to 3% of 
all implanted leads. In patients who are not 
pacemaker dependent, the event is usually not life-threatening, 
but can require invasive corrective 
procedures with potential complications. Mechanical 
damage is defined as coil deformation, coil fracture, 
mechanically induced insulation breeches, and 
insulation wear observed individually or in 
combination. Pacing lead coils under compression are 
characterized by flattened helical conductors. 
Fatigue fractures resulting from repeated cyclic 
compressive loading usually initiate at the outer 
surface of the coil. In view of the foregoing, it has been proposed 
that the percutaneous subclavian venipuncture approach 
should be abandoned because the incidence of lead 
fractur
