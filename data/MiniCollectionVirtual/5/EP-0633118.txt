<ABSTRACT>
A two-piece injection molding nozzle seal (42). The 
inner piece (76) through which the melt duct (40) extends is formed 

of a highly thermally conductive material to enhance heat 
transfer during the thermodynamic cycle. The surrounding 

outer retaining piece (78) which extends from the heated nozzle (12) 
into contact with the cooled mold (14) to provide the necessary 

seal is formed of a substantially less conductive material 
to avoid undue heat loss.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to injection
molding apparatus according to the precharacterizing portion
of claim 1.One piece nozzle seals and gate inserts having
various configurations to be seated in the front end of a
heated nozzle are well known. The applicants' U.S. Patent
Number 4,043,740 which issued August 23, 1977 shows a
nozzle seal which fits into a matching seat in the front
end of the nozzle and has a portion which tapers inwardly
around the gate. U.S. Patent Number 4,981,431 to Schmidt
which issued January 1, 1991 discloses a nozzle seal having
an outer sealing flange which is screwed into place in a
seat in the front end of the heated nozzle. The 
applicants' U.S. Patent Number 4,875,848 which issued
October 24, 1989 describes a gate insert which is also
screwed into place, but has an integral electrical heating
element U.S. Patent Number 5,028,227 to Gellert et al.
which issued July 2, 1991 relates to a gate insert having
a circumferential removal flange to allow it to be pried
out of place in the seat in the front end of the nozzle.From US 4,787,836 which was filed June 30, 1987 a nozzle seal is known which
comprises an outer cap member of less thermally conductive material and an inner
torpedo member insert of highly thermally conductive material with a torpedo shaped
member fitted thereon and being extended into the melt passage of the outer cap
member. The melt passage of said nozzle seal is formed in the inner torpedo member
insert and outer cap member.While these previous nozzle seals are satisfactory for many
applications, when molding materials having a narrow
temperature window such as Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)
it is very desirable to provide faster heat transfer along
the nozzle seal without excessive heat loss to the
surrounding cooled mold.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an injection molding
nozzle seal with an improved heat transfer characteristic to prevent undue heat loss. According to the present invention this objective is performed in
accordance with claim 1.Preferred embodiments of the invention are laid down in the dependent claims.Hereinafter the present invention is illustrated and explained in greater detail by means
of preferred embodiments with the accompanying drawings wherein: 
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a portion of a
multi-cavity injection molding system showing a two-piece
nozzle seal according to a first embodiment,Figure 2 is an exploded isometric view showing
the inner and outer pieces of the nozzle seal seen in

<CLAIMS>
Injection molding apparatus having at least one heated nozzle (12) and at least
one nozzle seal (42), the at least one heated nozzle (12) having a rear end (48), a

front end (52), and a central melt bore (38) extending therethrough from the rear
end (48) to the front end (52), the at least one heated nozzle (12) being seated in

a surrounding cooled mold (14), with an insulative air space (30) extending
between the at least one heated nozzle (12) and the surrounding cooled mold

(14) and the central melt bore (38) of the nozzle (12) extending in alignment with
a gate (44) to a cavity (46), the at least one nozzle seal (42) having a rear end

(82), a front end (84) and a central melt duct (40) extending therethrough from the
rear end (82) to the front end (84), the rear end (82) of the at least one nozzle

seal (42) being mounted in a threaded seat (54) in the front end (52) of the at

least one nozzle (12) and the front end (84) of the at least one nozzle seal (42) in
sealing contact in an opening (112) in the mold (14) around the gate (44) to

bridge a insulative air space (30) with the melt duct (40) through the at least one
nozzle seal (42) extending in alignment with the melt bore (38) through the at

least one nozzle (12), the at least one nozzle seal (42) comprises of a hollow
inner piece (76) of highly thermally conductive material and an outer retaining

piece (78) of less thermally conductive material, the outer retaining piece (78)

securely retain the 

inner piece in place, 
characterized in that
, the inner piece (76) is positioned
between the central melt duct (40) and the retaining piece (78) over the entire

length of the at least one nozzle seal (42) between the rear end (82) and the front
end (84) thus keeping the central melt duct (40) from contacting the outer

retaining piece (78). 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim 1
wherein the outer surface (80) of the inner piece (76)
