<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally concerned with the purification 
of liquids. Of particular interest is the treatment of water which contains 
dissolved salts, such as seawater, brackish water or hard water. Such 
waters may be purified by forcing the water through a semipermeable 
reverse osmosis membrane, leaving behind the contaminants or salts 
which do not pass through the membrane. A reverse osmosis membrane typically rejects a high 
fraction of the dissolved salts. It is also important that such membranes 
pass a relatively large amount of water (i.e., have a high water flux) 
through the membrane at relatively low pressures. In addition, the 
membrane must be tolerant to chlorine, if added as a disinfectant. 
Although pretreatment to remove the chlorine is often employed to 
protect the membrane, the treatment may not always be effective and 
some chlorine tolerance is desirable. Many U.S. patents describe membranes which are useful 
in desalination processes, see for example, those cited and discussed in 
US-A-4,830,885 to Tran et al. One of the earliest patents to 
describe membranes of the type used in the present invention is 
US-A-3,744,642 to Scala et al. The semipermeable membrane used in the desalination 
process ordinarily will be thin in order to maximize the water flux. Thus 
the membrane often is formed on a porous support to provide strength, 
the combination being referred to as a thin film composite (TFC) 
membrane. The supports should have pores which are sufficiently large 
so that the water (permeate) can pass through the support without 
reducing the flux of the entire composite. Conversely, the pores should 
not be so large that the thin semipermeable membrane will be unable to 
bridge the pores or will fill up or penetrate too far into the pores. Scala  
 
et al. suggest that with pores above about 8 microns 
(8000 nm) the rejection of impurities is reduced. In general, those skilled in the art have 
preferred to use primary amines to form thin film 
composite membranes by reaction with aromatic polyacyl 
halides. This is despite the belief that chlorine will 
attack the hydrogen in the amide group -CO-NH-, as 
suggested in US-A-3,951,815. Based on such 
reasoning, secondary amines have been suggested in 
US-A-4,259,183, which employed aliphatic or 
cycloaliphatic secondary amines, preferably piperazine. The patentee of the '183 patent also claimed 
in US-A-4,277,344 that primary amine groups 
should be used with aromatic substrates rather than 
secondary amine groups and noted
