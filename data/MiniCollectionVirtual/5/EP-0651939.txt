<ABSTRACT>
A harvesting machine possesses a conveying device (60) for picking up a crop from the ground and for transferring it, for example into a press chamber (56). The conveying device (60) carries on a rotating spring-tine structure, on a plurality of axes extending parallel to one another, spring tines (74) which move between strippers (100). The strippers (100) possess an upper leg, on which the conveyed material slides and which contains an ascending portion (110) following a front region (108).

<CLAIMS>
A stripper (100) of a conveyor device (60) of a harvesting machine (10) with a front region
(108) disposed on the receiving end with a curved shape and an upper limb which includes a

straight first section (110) rising in the conveying direction, along which the conveyed material
slides, characterized in that the upper limb includes a curved second section (114) following

thereon in the conveying diretion, shaped like a mirror image of the front region (108).
A stripper (100) according to claim 1, characterized in that the straight first section (110)
adjoins the front region (108) tangentially and/or the second section (144) adjoins the straight

first section (110) tangentially.
A stripper (100) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a lower limb (112) opposite
the upper limb adjoins the front region (108) and runs divergently in the conveying direction

relative to the first section (110) of the upper limb.
A harvesting machine (10) in the form of a round baler with a conveyor device (60) for
receiving harvested material from the ground and passing it to a baling chamber (56), which

comprises spring tines (74) rotating about an axis and strippers (100), which leave a gap
therebetween, through which the tines (75) of the spring tines (74) are moved, characterized in

that the strippers (100) are formed in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 3.
A harvesting machine according to claim 4, characterized in that it includes a lower roller (40),
on which a bale (62) formed from the harvested material can be supported directly or via belts

(42), and in that the curved second section (114) so adjoins the roller (40) that a space holding
the conveyed material in engagement with the roller (40) results therebetween.
A harvesting machine according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that at least one movable belt
(42) is provided, which receives the conveyed material from the conveyor device (60) and

passes it on, wherein the belt surface and the surface of the straight first section (110) always
include an obtuse angle.
A harvesting machine according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the spring tines (74) are retained on tine bars, which extend parallel to a drive shaft (68) of the 

spring tines (74), are held on an adjusting plate (102) and rotate with the drive shaft (68).
A harvesting machine according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the drive shaft (68) is coaxial with the axis of curvature of the front region (108).
A harvesting machine according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that the spring tines (74) can
be brought into differently inclined positions in particular by an eccentric arrangement of the

tine bars on the adjusting plate (102).
A harvesting machine according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized by an
arrangement of the strippers (100) relative to the spring tines (74) or the adjusting plate (102)

carrying them, such that their tines (75) extend in the front region (108) nearly completely
beyond the strippers (100) and in the region of the second curved section (114) on the inside or

substantially on the inside of the strippers (100).
A harvesting machine according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the plane of the first straight section (110) guiding the conveyed material runs tangentially or

substantially tangentially to the roller (40).
