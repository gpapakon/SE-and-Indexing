<ABSTRACT>
A multichannel imaging spectrometer for airborne geological, geophysical and environmental surveys in a moving vehicle. An optical scanner (123) employs a rotating polygon (20) allowing reduced scan optics with increased data acquisition efficiency. Multiple spectrometers (122) integrally registered allow channelization of the received signal to optimize noise performance in the range from ultraviolet through infrared. Output data is in a form for recording and real time display. A staring mode configuration provides enhanced sensitivity by using a two-dimensional detector array (320, 330) and adjustable mirror orientation. A scanning mode embodiment employs a two-dimensional detector array with time delay integration and three-dimensional storage of temporal spatial data and spectral wavelength and intensity. Thus, all channels are acquired simultaneously, resulting in perfect band-to-band registration with continuous spectral curves over the field of view.

 AIRBORNE MULTIBAND IMAGING SPECTROMETERBackground Of The Invention1. Field of the InventionThe invention relates generally to spectrometers, and more particularly to an apparatus for narrowband radio- metry and for real time detection, recording, and display of mineralogic spectra in the form of radiated and reflected emissions for airborne geological investigations.2. Description of the Prior ArtIn U.S. Patent No. 5,149,959 invented by . E. Collins, et al and issued to the assignee of the present invention there was disclosed a multichannel imaging spectrometer for low speed, low altitude airborne geological, geophysical and environmental surveys, particularly adapted to provide detector limited noise threshold. An optical scanner employed a rotating polygon mirror allowing reduced scan optics with increased data acquisition efficiency. Scan speeds from 5 to 50 scan/sec with up to 2048 pixels per scan are available. Multiple spectrometers integrally registered allow channelization of the received signal to optimize noise performance in the range from ultraviolet through infrared. Output data is in a form for recording and real time display. All channels are acquired simultaneously, resulting in perfect band-to-bance registration with continuous spectral curves for each pixel.The Collins invention utilized a technique referred to as line or one-dimensional spectroscopy in which radiated or 

reflected energy ranging from ultraviolet to infrared emanation from a terrain under observation is collimated and dispersed by diffraction gratings to provide a line image spectral display. There is a direct correlation between the detected line images and the physical configuration of the radiation source. By scanning over the surface of the terrain in a moving vehicle, preferably an aircraft, a spectral map can be obtained.A rotating mirror is disposed to form a line image transverse to the flight path of an aircraft carrying the apparatus. For maximum spectral resolution, a plurality of spectral bands with corresponding line array detectors are provided. However, as the bandpass of a given spectral band is narrowed to provide enhanced resolution, there results an increase in attenuation of the perceived spectral energy.Further, the scanning mirror intercepts only a fraction of the available energy at any instant, thereby limiting the threshold sensitivity of the apparatus.The present invention provides means for generating a line image with the mirror fixed at a predetermined angle with respect to the observed
