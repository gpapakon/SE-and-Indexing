<ABSTRACT>
A nuclear fuel assembly includes a fuel 
assembly support plate with a round orifice for the 

passage of a flow stream and having a rectangular or 
square channel entry area immediately below the fuel 

assembly. The assembly includes a transition piece for 
coupling the flow stream from the orifice to the channel 

entry area. The transition piece has a first cylindrical 
portion with a constant diameter at least as large as the 

diameter of the orifice and disposed immediately above 
the orifice for allowing the flow stream from the orifice 

to fully enter the first portion and attach to the inner 
sides of the first portion. A second portion is included 

for coupling to the channel entry area. The second 
portion has a rectangular or square upper section and a 

round lower section. A conical third portion is included 
for connecting the first portion with the round lower 

section of the second portion for allowing controlled 
expansion of fluid in said transition piece. The conical 

portion has a cross-sectional diameter which increases in 
the flow direction from the first portion to the second 

portion for allowing controlled expansion of fluid in the 
transition piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to the application entitled 
"Method for Modifying Existing Transition Pieces in 
Bottom Entry Nuclear Assemblies for Reducing Coolant 
Pressure Drop" filed simultaneously herewith. The present invention relates to coolant flow 
transition pieces in bottom entry fuel assembly type 
nuclear reactors and, in particular, a modified design of 
such transition piece to reduce coolant pressure drop. Figure 1a illustrates a bottom entry fuel 
assembly 10 of the prior art typically used in BWR 
reactors. The assembly includes a number of nuclear fuel 
rods 11 disposed between upper and lower tie plates 12 
and 13. The assembly includes at the bottom of the lower 
tie plate a transition section 15 for directing coolant 
into the fuel assembly. The transition section 15 is 
better shown in Figure 1b with reference to the fuel 
assembly support plate 18. The transition section, 
hereafter referred to as the transition piece 15, may be 
either separate from the lower tie plate grid or it may 
be integral with the grid, dependent on the designed 
interface with the fuel channel.  Referring to Figure 1b, the transition piece 15 
between the fuel assembly and the fuel supporting plate 
18 in such bottom entry fuel assemblies is subject to 
certain constraints. The top portion 16 must interface 
with a channel in a prescribed manner and is generally 
square in shape. The portion which goes from round to 
square is indicated as A and in one prior art arrangement 
was about 69 mm. The portion 17 of the transition piece 
extending downward to the fuel assembly support plate 18 
in Figure 1b is generally round and must seat in a 
specific diameter opening of specific depth. The 
distance between the fuel assembly support plate and the 
fuel assembly itself is defined. In the prior design as shown in Figures 1a and 
1b, the lower end of the transition piece 15 comprises a 
three-prong lead in finger 19 which is located just above 
the orifice 20 when the transition piece 15 is seated on 
the fuel assembly support plate 18. This prior 
arrangement allowed uncontrolled expansion of the coolant 
flow which resulted in a time varying jet of fluid from 
the orifice. This in turn contributed to fuel rod and 
water rod vibration which resulted in failure of lower 
end caps. In this prior design, in particular, as the 
flow field passes through the opening in the fuel support 
plate, it narrows in diameter and then expands. The 
primary portion of the flow field remains at a velocity 
typical of the orifice cross
