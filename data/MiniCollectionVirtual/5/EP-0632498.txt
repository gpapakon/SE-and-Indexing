<ABSTRACT>
A housed integrated circuit unit package is provided with a heat sink for 
removal and dissipation of heat from electronic circuits housed in packages. The heat 

sink, mounted on an outer surface of the package, includes a plurality of pins secured 
at one end with a retainer and flared out at the other end into a starburst or bouquet 

configuration, the pins being in the form of rods selected from solid cylinders and 
tubes. The bottom of the retainer-bound end is coated with a securing substance, 

such as solder or a heat-conducting adhesive, which is planarized to facilitate 
positioning of the heat sink on the package. The heat sink is secured to the package 

by means of solder or a heat-conducting adhesive. The heat sink is produced by 
securing a plurality of elongated rods by retainers placed at intervals corresponding 

to a height of the heat sink, cutting off said rods adjacent to one side of the retainer, 
and flaring the rods at the other free end of the cut-off rods into a starburst-like 

configuration. The retained ends of the rods are dipped into a solder or heat-conducting 
adhesive and planarized to provide a planar surface for mounting the heat 

sink on the surface of the package.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a heat sink for removal and dissipation of heat 
from electronic circuits, such as housed in packages. Integrated circuit units, such as integrated circuit chips (ICs) and hybrid 
integrated circuit (HIC) modules, are conventionally housed in suitable plastic or 
ceramic packages to protect them mechanically, electrically and chemically. 
However, such packages are not always capable of efficiently dissipating the heat 
generated by the circuits. In order to overcome this problem, a given package is 
provided with a heat sink that is attached to its outer surface. Typically a heat sink 
utilizes an array of elongated fins arranged on a common platform. The heat sink is 
often used in conjunction with a cooling fluid, such as air, circulating through the 
spaces between the fins for conducting the heat away from the circuit. One example 
of a prior art pin-fin heat sink, 61, mounted on a pin grid array package, 62, is shown 
in FIG. 6. In FIG. 7 is shown another version of a prior art channeled-fin heat sink, 
71, mounted on quad flatpack package 72. A drawback of the prior art heat sink is 
its relative high cost. A pin-fin heat sink is made by a costly process of machining 
out of a block of metal a plurality of square pin fins. Furthermore, a channeled fin 
heat sink is highly dependent on the direction of the cooling fluid flow. The fluid 
flowing through the channels between the fins of the channeled-fin heat sink removes 
heat much more efficiently than the fluid flowing transverse to the heat sink. This invention embodies a heat sink for removal and dissipation of heat 
from electronic circuits housed in IC packages. The heat sink, mounted on an outer 
surface of the package, includes a plurality of pins secured at one end with a retainer 
and flared out at the other end into a starburst or bouquet configuration. The bottom 
of the retainer-bound end is coated with a securing substance, such as solder or a 
heat-conducting adhesive, which is planarized to facilitate positioning of the heat 
sink on the package. The heat sink is secured to the package by means of solder or a 
heat-conducting adhesive. The heat sink is produced by securing a plurality of 
elongated rods by retainers placed along the rods at intervals corresponding to a 
height of the heat sink, cutting off said rods adjacent to one side of the retainer to 
form pins of the heat sink, and flaring the rods at the other free end of the cut-off 
rods into a starburst-like configuration. The retained ends of the
