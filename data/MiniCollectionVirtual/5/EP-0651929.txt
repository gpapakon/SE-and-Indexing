<ABSTRACT>
A system for detecting and automatically correcting X-Y errors in displayed image data. In a specific implementation, the invention (6, 10) includes a display driver (12, 14, 16, 4) for commanding the display (2) to display a picture element of an image at a predetermined position on a display screen thereof. The actual position of the displayed picture element is detected (6) and used to calculate a set of correction factors which are used in real time to correct the positioning of picture elements of actual image data (20, 24, 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to display systems.
More specifically, the present invention relates to
systems for improving the image quality of large screen
display systems.Image registration and distortion are critical
issues in large screen display design. DE-A-3 311 786, US-A-4 099 092, EP-A-0 474 420, U.S. Patent Nos. US-A-4,683,467,
issued July 28, 1987 to Macaulay et al., and
US-A-5,020,116, issued May 28, 1991 to Macaulay,
describe image registration systems which incorporate a
photodetector arrangement to align color images in large
screen displays. Barrel distortion and pin cushion distortion are two
well known examples of the effects of X-Y image
distortion. X-Y image distortion is due to many factors
including nonlinearities in deflection circuits and
mechanisms and leakages in deflection yokes.The conventional technique for correcting for
distortion in large screen displays is to overlay a grid
on the screen and project a test pattern on the screen.
A human operator then uses a cursor to move pixels that
are out of place to a proper position as determined by
the grid. The degree of movement required to position
the pixel is stored and used as a correction factor to
position pixels of actual image data.Unfortunately, this process is tedious and error
prone. The correction factor may vary with each operator
and, in the case of direct view cathode ray tube
displays, movement of the operator's head may change the
viewing position and introduce parallax error. Also, no
reference element is commonly provided so that linearity
can not be established accurately.In the case of projection displays, a carefully
ruled calibration reference screen is required. Some
mechanism is required to install such a screen on a
temporary basis during the convergence and linearity
adjustment process. The physical layout of the viewing
theater may make even temporary installation difficult or
impractical. In addition, there is often no safe
vantage point for a human operator.Thus, there is a need in the art for an automatic
system and technique for correcting image distortion in
large screen display systems which minimizes the need for
operator involvement. The need in the art is addressed by the present
invention which provides a display system having correction
of X-Y image positioning errors, and an associated method,
as claimed in claims 1 and 9 hereinafter. In a specific
implementation, the invention includes a display driver for
commanding the display to display a picture element of an
image at a predetermined
