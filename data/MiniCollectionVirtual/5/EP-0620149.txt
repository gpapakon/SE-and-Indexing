<ABSTRACT>
A shackle lock holder is provided. A support (10) is attached 
to a stay (5) of a load-carrying platform (4) of a bicycle. 

The support (10) includes a member (19) and a slider (24) 
which engage both ends of shackle (8) for holding a shackle 

lock(7) . The member (19) is secured to the support (10). 
The slider (24) is slidable along the support (10), and urged 

toward the member (19) by the force of a spring. The slider

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for a shackle lock. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to a holder 
securing a shackle lock, which locks a wheel of a bicycle, a 
motorbike, etc., to the vehicle, when the shackle lock is not 
in use. A shackle lock is employed as locking means for preventing a 
bicycle, etc., from being stolen. The shackle lock is formed 
by a shackle having a U-shape and a lock bar for joining ends 
of the shackle. When the ends of the shackle are inserted 
into holes formed in the lock bar, the shackle is locked by 
the lock bar so as to fasten the bicycle to an installed 
equipment. The shackle and lock bar can be separated for unlocking. Figs. 6 and 7 show a holder 32 for holding a shackle lock 
which is not in use. The holder 32 is mounted to a vertical 
pipe 31a of a bicycle frame 31. The holder 32 is made of an 
elastic resin material. As shown in Fig. 7, the holder 32 
includes a pipe fastener 36 and a clamp 37. Two opposed 
protrusions 36a are formed at the outside of the fastener 36. The fastener 36 opened by splitting the both protrusions 36a, 
can be mounted on a vertical pipe 31a. After the fastener 
36 is mounted on the pipe 31a, the protrusions 36a are  
 
fastened to each other by a pair of bolts 39, such that a 
holder 32 is secured to the pipe 31a. A pair of protruding 
plates 37a is formed at the outside of the clamp 37. A clamp 
37b for seizing an end a shackle 34 extends outwardly from the 
top of each plate 37a. A lever 38 is rotatably mounted to the 
plate 37a by way of the pins 38a. When the lever 38 is 
rotated to the position indicated by a double dotted line to 
release the binding of the plates 37a, an end of a lock bar 
35 joined with the shackle 34 is inserted into the clamp 37. 
The end of the shackle 34 is positioned within the clamp 37b. 
Subsequently, the lever 38 is rotated to the position 
indicated by the solid line for tightly fastening the plates 
37a each other. Therefore, a shackle lock 33 is secured to 
the holder 32. However, the holder 32 is elastically deformable. The end of 
the shackle lock 33 is secured to the holder, such that the 
holder 32 supports entire weight of shackle lock 33. 
Therefore, securing condition of the shackle lock 33 becomes 
loose which is caused by vibration, etc., generated while the 
bicycle is running. Thus, there is a fear that the shackle 
lock 33 may fall out from the holder 32.
 
The length of the frame pipe 31a may differ according to a 
type of bicycle. There is a drawback that the
