<ABSTRACT>
Casing for a filter cartridge including a cylindrical vessel (7) capable of being screwed onto a carrier which may receive a removable lid (8). According to the invention the vessel comprises a noncontinuous internal flange (17) and the lid has studs (19) which interact with this flange to prevent a rotation of the lid. A locking ring (22) partially covers the lid and comprises an internal edge (26) which has indentations (27) into which are clipped resilient hooks (21) of the lid and each of which comprises two notches (29) at their ends to receive the hook while defining two marked angular positions of the ring in relation to the lid, namely a locked position where the ring retains the lid on the vessel and an unlocked position where the said ring releases the lid.

Casing for filter cartridge (2), comprising a cylindrical 
trough (7) which may be screwed on to a support (11), said 

cylindrical trough having a free edge (7
1
) which can receive 
a movable lid (8) which has a central member (14 ) for 

screwing the trough on or off, characterised in that : 

the free edge (7
1
) is extended by a discontinuous shoulder 
(17) projecting outwards, and comprising at least two stubs 

(18); 
the lid (8) has, on the trough (7) side, at least one pin 
(19) which can co-operate angularly with the shoulder (17) 

of the trough in order to prevent rotation of the lid 
relative to the trough, and an annular partition (20) which 

can fit in a sealed manner in the trough, the lid also 
comprising, opposite the trough, at least two hooks (21, 40) 

which have noses (21
1
, 40
1
) oriented radially outwards, and 
resiliently movable towards the interior; 
the said casing also comprises a locking ring (22) having 
on the one hand a collar (23) which partially covers the lid 

(8) and on the other hand a substantially cylindrical skirt 
(24) which can engage on the exterior of the free edge of 

the trough (7), said skirt comprising internal bosses (25) 
adapted to penetrate axially between the stubs (18) of the 

shoulder of the trough, then to engage under said stubs by  
 

means of rotation of the ring relative to the trough, in 
order to provide axial locking of the lid on the trough; 
the collar (23) of the ring comprises an internal edge 
(26) upon which there are clip-fastened hooks (21, 40) of 

the lid, enabling angular displacement of the ring relative 
to the lid, the noses (21
1
, 40
4
) of the hooks locally 
covering the collar (23) of the ring in order to prevent 

axial separation of the ring and of the lid; 
said casing comprises indexing means (21, 29; 40, 29'
1
, 
29'
2
), which define two indexed angular positions of the 
ring (22) relative to the lid (8), i.e. a locked position 

and an unlocked position, the unlocked position permitting 
simultaneous axial penetration of the internal bosses (25) 

of the skirt of the ring and of the pin (19) of the lid 
between the stubs (18) of the edge of the trough, and the 

internal bosses (25) being engaged beneath the stubs (18) of 
the edge of the trough in the locked position, the ring and 

the lid being retained in a reversible fashion in their 
indexed positions by indexing means. 
Casing according to claim 1, in which the internal edge 
(26) of the collar of the ring has at least one fillet (27) 

in the shape of the arc of a circle, which is concentric 
with the skirt and in which there is clip-fastened one of 

the hooks (21), said fillet extending circumferentially  
 

between two substantially radial stops (28) which co-operate 
with said hook in order to limit the angular displacement of 

the ring relative to the lid, said fillet also comprising 
two notches (29) close to its stops (28) for receiving in a 

reversible manner the hook (21) clip-fastened in said 
fillet, thus defining the two angular indexed positions of 

the ring (22) relative to the lid (8). 
Casing according to any one of claims 1 and 2, in which 
the discontinuous shoulder (17) of said trough has a flap 

(18
1
) which extends axially along the trough (7). 
Casing according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which the discontinuous shoulder (17) is reinforced by 

punched indentation (30) provided on the free edge (7
1
) of 
the trough. 
Casing according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which the internal bosses (25) of the skirt of the ring are 

constituted by clefts, each forming a graduation towards the 
interior of the skirt. 
Casing according to claim 5, in which the ring has a 
diameter which is sufficiently small to be held in the hand, 

and the clefts (25) form grasping means appropriate to co-operate  

 
with the fingers of the hand in order to rotate the 

ring (22) relative to the lid (8). 
Casing according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which the collar (23) of the ring is supported on the lid in 

an annular zone (23
1
) close to the skirt (24). 
Casing according to claim 7, in which the internal edge 
(26) of the collar of the ring is raised relative to the 

annular contact zone (23
1
) between the ring (22) and the lid 
(8), and the hooks (21) of the lid extend substantially 

axially from the level of the said annular contact zone to 
the level of said internal edge. 
Casing according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which each notch (29) of the fillet of the ring is separated 

from the rest of the fillet by a slanting slot (31) forming 
an obtuse angle with the said notch (29). 
Casing according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which the lid has a peripheral rim (32) made in such a way 

as not to interfere with the internal bosses (25) of the 
skirt of the ring during axial fitting of the ring (22) on 

the lid (8).  
 
Casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
further comprising blocking means (40) for blocking the ring 

(22) in its locked position, and unblocking means (41) which 
may be actuated in order temporarily to neutralise the 

action of the blocking means. 
Casing according to claim 11, in which the blocking 
means are constituted by a blocking member (40) movable 

between a blocking position and an unblocking position, said 
blocking member being urged by resilient means (42) towards 

its blocked position, the unblocking means being constituted 
by an actuating member (41) which can shift the blocking 

member towards its unblocked position against the action of 
the resilient means (42), the casing further comprising a 

stop member (43) which can co-operate with the blocking 
member (40) in order to block the ring (22) in its locked 

position, one of either the blocking member (40) and the 
stop member (43) being integral with the ring (22), and the 

other of the blocking member and the stop member being 
integral with the lid (8) or with the trough (7) of the 

casing. 
Casing according to claim 12, in which the resilient 
means (42) are constituted by a radially-deformable 

resilient finger which extends axially from the lid (8) to a  
 

free end comprising the blocking member (40), the actuating 
member (41) being a pusher which permits the resilient 

finger (42) to yield radially inwards, bringing it into its 
unblocking position, and the stop member (43) being 

constituted by a radial slot on the internal edge (26) of 
the collar (23) of the ring, said radial slot abutting 

angularly against the blocking member (40) when the latter 
is in its blocking position. 
Casing according to claim 3, in which the internal edge 
(26) of the collar of the ring comprises a fillet (27') 

which extends angularly between two notches (29'), these two 
notches comprising a first notch in which a blocking member 

engages when the ring is in its locked position, and a 
second notch in which the blocking member engages when the 

ring is in its unlocked position, the first notch being 
separated from the rest of the fillet (27') by a first 

radial slot (43) of the internal edge (26) of the collar, 
this first radial slot constituting the stop member which 

co-operates with the blocking member (40) in order to 
prevent rotation of the ring towards its unlocked position, 

the second slot being itself separated from the rest of the 
fillet (27') by a second slot (31') of the internal edge of 

the collar, the blocking member (40) projecting radially 
outwards from the free end of the resilient finger (42) and  

 
comprising a face (40
1
) which is oriented towards the skirt 
(23) of the ring, and which comprises a blocking surface 

(40
2
) and a cam surface (40
3
), the blocking surface 
extending axially and radially, and being capable of 

abutting against the first slot (43) when the ring is in its 
locked position, the resilient finger (42) being 

sufficiently flexible to enable the said blocking surface to 
pass above the skirt (26) when the pusher (41) is pressed, 

and the cam surface (40
3
) being an inclined surface which 
extends angularly from the blocking surface (40
2
), away from 
the lid (8), the cam surface being capable of sliding on the 

second slot (31'), causing the resilient finger (42) to 
yield sufficiently to pass above the skirt (26) when the 

ring is displaced from its unlocked position to its locked 
position. 
Casing according to claim 14, in which the second slot 
(31') is a slanting slot forming an obtuse angle with the 

second slot (29'). 
Casing according to claim 14 or claim 15, in which the 
face (40
1
) of the blocking member, which is oriented towards 
the collar (26), further comprises two flattened portions 

(40
4
) which frame the blocking surface and the cam surface, 
one at least of said flattened portions partially covering  

 
the collar (26) when the ring (22) is in its locked position 

or in its unlocked position, the blocking member (40) and 
the resilient finger (42) thus constituting one of the hooks 

which retain the ring (22) on the lid (8). 
Casing according to any one of claims 13 to 16, in which 
the blocking member (40) forms part of the indexing means of 

the ring relative to the lid.
