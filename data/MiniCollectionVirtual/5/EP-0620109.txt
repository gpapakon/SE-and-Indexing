<ABSTRACT>
A structure is disclosed comprising a layer 
of polyurethane foam bonded to at least one layer of 

another material, especially a layer of fibreglass 
matte, a layer of cellulosic material e.g. cardboard, 

and/or a layer of polyurethane foam. The layers are 
bonded together with an adhesive of polyethylene or 

polypropylene that has been grafted with an 
ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or 

anhydride thereof, the adhesive containing at least 
0.03% by weight of said acid or anhydride. The 

structure exhibits a temperature for heat-fail 
resistance in shear of at least 90°C. In embodiments, 

the polyurethane foam is a rigid polyurethane foam, and 
the polyethylene and polypropylene have been grafted 

with fumaric acid, maleic acid or maleic anhydride. As 
an example, the structure is comprised of a layer of 

fibreglass matte, at least one layer of polyurethane 
foam and a layer of fibreglass matte, the layers being 

bonded together with the adhesive. The structure may 
be used as so-called headliners in automobiles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laminates of 
polyurethane foam and especially to laminates of 
polyurethane foam with fibreglass matte, cellulosic 
structures e.g. cardboard, and/or polyurethane foam. 
In particular, the invention relates to such laminates 
having a temperature for heat-fail resistance in shear, 
a measurement of the temperature at which delamination 
of a laminate occurs, of at least 70°C. Laminates of polyurethane foams with fibreglass 
matte and/or cardboard are used in a number of 
end-uses, particularly in the form of liners for 
passenger compartments of automobiles i.e. as so-called 
headliners. Such liners are often multi-layered 
structures, usually having an outer layer of a fabric 
material for aesthetic reasons. The traditional 
adhesive for such structures is a polyurethane 
adhesive, which has given liners of acceptable 
structural properties. However, polyurethane adhesives 
are increasingly in disfavour because of environmental 
and occupational health objections to the use of 
isocyanate-containing adhesives. Thus, alternate 
adhesives are required that do comply with 
environmental and occupational health requirements, as 
well as meet product specifications for the resultant 
bonded structure. Moreover, any such adhesive should 
be economical. As used herein, a "rigid foam" is defined 
according to the specifications in ASTM D1566-82 
entitled "Definitions of Terms Relating to Rubber". As used herein, "temperature for heat-fail 
resistance in shear" is measured according to the 
procedure of ASTM D4498 entitled Heat-Fail Temperature 
in Shear of Hot-Melt Adhesives, except that the weight 
used was 300g; use of heavier weights may result in 
physical failure of the polyurethane foam layer.  It has now been found that polyethylene and 
polypropylene grafted with an ethylenically unsaturated 
dicarboxylic acid or anhydride, optionally in the form 
of grafted polymer blended with ungrafted polymer, may 
be used in the bonding of polyurethane foam structures, 
without the use of isocyanates. Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
structure comprising:
 
a layer of polyurethane foam bonded to at least one of 
a layer of fibreglass matte, a layer of cellulosic 
material and a layer of polyurethane foam;
 
said layers being bonded together with an adhesive of 
polyethylene or polypropylene that has been grafted 
with an ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or 
anhydride thereof, or derivative thereof, said adhesive 
containing at least about 0.03% by weight
