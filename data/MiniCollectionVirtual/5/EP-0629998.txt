<ABSTRACT>
A heterogeneous thin film structure (10) including a 
discontinuous layer (15) of ferromagnetic material deposited 

on an insulating substrate (13) and overcoated with a layer 
(17) of nonmagnetic electrically conductive material exhibits 

giant magnetoresistance in saturation fields on the order of 
350 Oersteds. A layer of ferromagnetic material is deposited 

on a heated insulating substrate by evaporation techniques to 
form a layer of isolated ferromagnetic particles and 

overcoated with a nonmagnetic conductive material to form a 
plurality of ferromagnetic particles embedded in a nonmagnetic 

conductive matrix. As the ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic 
materials are deposited separat
ely, it is not required that 
the two materials be immiscible and subsequent annealing is 

not required to induce phase separation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to magnetic transducers 
for reading information signals recorded in a magnetic medium 
and, more particularly, to a magnetoresistive film, to a method 
of fabricating said film and to a magnetoresistive sensor 
employing said film. It is well-known in the prior art to utilize a magnetic 
read transducer referred to as a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor or 
head for reading high density recorded data from magnetic media. 
An MR sensor detects magnetic field signals through the 
resistance changes of a read element fabricated of a magnetic 
material as a function of the strength and direction of magnetic 
flux being sensed by the read element. These prior art MR 
sensors operate on the basis of the anisotropic magnetoresistive 
(AMR) effect in which a component of the read element resistance 
varies as the square of the cosine (cos²) of the angle between 
the magnetization and the direction of sense current flow 
through the read element. A more detailed description of the 
AMR effect can be found in "Memory, Storage, and Related 
Applications", D.A. Thompson et al., IEEE Trans. Mag. MAG-11, 
p. 1039 (1975). U.S. Patent No. 4,896,235 entitled "Magnetic Transducer 
Head Utilizing Magnetoresistance Effect", granted to Takino et 
al on January 23, 1990, discloses a multilayered magnetic sensor 
which utilizes the AMR and comprises first and second magnetic 
layers separated by a nonmagnetic layer in which at least one of 
the magnetic layers is of a material exhibiting the AMR effect. 
The easy axis of magnetisation in each of the magnetic layers is 
set perpendicular to the applied magnetic signal such that the 
current in the MR sensor element provides a magnetic field in 
the magnetic layers parallel to the easy axis thus eliminating 
or minimizing Barkhausen noise in the sensor. "Thin Film MR  
 
Head for High Density Rigid Disk Drive" by H. Suyama et al, IEEE 
Trans. Mag., Vol. 24, No. 6, 1988 (pages 2612-2614) discloses a 
multilayered MR sensor similar to that disclosed by Takino et 
al. A second, different and more pronounced magnetoresistive 
effect has also been described in which the change in resistance 
of a layered magnetic sensor is attributed to the spin-dependent 
transmission of conduction electrons between ferromagnetic 
layers via a nonmagnetic layer separating the ferromagnetic 
layers and the accompanying spin-dependent scattering at the 
layer interfaces. This magnetoresistive effect is variously 
referred to as the "giant magnetoresistive" or "spin
