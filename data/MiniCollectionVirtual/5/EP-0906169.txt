<ABSTRACT>
A machine and method for corrugating preformed plates that form the core element (50) of a heat exchanger (10). A fold forming mechanism (112) imparts an initial fold in the deformable links (28, 30) joining a series of preformed plates received from an external source. A gathering mechanism (132, 134) gathers the folded series of preformed plates to produce a flow of pairs of mating plates (140). Precut lengths of corrugated fins (45) are then inserted between joined adjacent pairs of mating plates (140) and a cut-off mechanism (156) severs the deformable links (28, 30) of preselected pairs of links joining pairs of mating plates to separate individual core elements (50) from the flow of plates (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEAT EXCHANGER CORE METHOD AND APPARATUSTechnical FieldThe invention is related to the field of folded plate heat exchangers and, in particular, to a machine for making the core element of a folded plate heat exchanger.Background ArtFolded or corrugated plate heat exchangers are well known in the art. In these types of heat exchan¬ gers, elongated plates are joined together to define a plurality of fluid passageways therethrough. Each of the passageways is formed between the inwardly facing surfaces of a joined pair of mating plates. The interi- ors of these joined mating plates define fluid passage¬ ways through which a refrigerant, a fluid or a gas to be cooled may flow. It is also known in the art to insert conductive fins between adjacent pairs of mating plates to enhance the heat exchange between the fluid flowing through the internal passageways and a fluid, such as air flowing between the adjacent pairs of mating plates. Heat exchangers of this type have particular utility as evaporators for air conditioning systems, oil coolers, condensers, radiators, and the like.Typically, folded plate heat exchangers are manufactured by stacking individual plates together to form a plurality of adjacent pairs, then interleaving the pairs of mating plates with conductive fins to form a stacked plate structure. End plates are then placed at opposite ends of the stacked plate structure to form 

a heat exchanger core. The assembled heat exchanger core is then brazed in a furnace to complete the manu¬ facturing process.Assembly of a heat exchanger core in this manner is a labor-intensive process requiring human assemblers to physically stack the individual plates with each other to form the heat exchanger core prior to being brazed.Methods which increase productivity m fabn- eating corrugated plate heat exchangers are disclosed m U.S. Patent No. 3,258,832 and 3,344,925, which are incorporated herein by reference. These patents dis¬ close a method of making heat exchanger cores m which a plurality of individual plates are stamped from a single strip and interlinked to each other. The inter¬ linked plates are then folded m a zig-zag (W type) configuration to form the desired stacked plate struc¬ ture .Disclosure Of The InventionThe invention is directed to a machine for continuously stacking a strip of preformed plates to generate a connected string of mating plates, for inserting the conductive fins between adjacent pairs of mating plates, and for severing the connecting links to separate a desired number of
