<ABSTRACT>
A method for supplying printing ink in the vibrating inking unit of a printing machine, in which the supply takes place transversely relative to the printing direction in a zonally varying manner in each case by adjusting a film thickness gradient of the printing ink directed towards the printing forme, is to be improved in such a way that, especially in the case of a small proportion of the surface of the printing forme to be printed, the fewest possible balancing sheets in relation to a steady-state inking level can be achieved relative to the next steady-state inking level. According to the invention, this is achieved in that, in at least one zone and at least for a specific duration, a delivery of printing ink takes place by adjusting a film thickness gradient directed in the opposite direction. This can be achieved, for example, in that no supply of printing ink takes place in specific zones and the return flow of ink present in these zones is balanced by an increased supply of printing ink in other zones with a correspondingly steeper film thickness gradient.

Method for supplying printing ink in the ductor inking 
unit of a printing press, particularly a sheet offset 

printing press, wherein during the printing the supply 
transverse to the printing direction takes place 

differentially zonewise in each case by adjustment of a 
fall in layer thickness directed in the direction of the 

printing forme dependent on the ink requirements of the 
printing forme characterised in that at least in one 

zone and at least for a certain amount of time a reverse 
transport of printing ink takes place by adjustment of 

an oppositely directed fall in layer thickness and in at 
least one further zone a compensation of the oppositely 

transported printing ink takes place by an increased ink 
supply. 
Method according to claim 1 characterised in that in 
certain zones no supply of printing ink takes place. 
Method according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
zones via which no supply of printing ink ought to occur 

are determined with respect to the proportion of the 
surface of the printing forme to be printed. 
Method according to claim 2 or 3 characterised in that a 
printing ink supply takes place in respectively 

alternate zones and in intermediately lying zones no 
printing ink supply takes place. 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 4 characterised in 
that at the beginning of printing in place of a 

preadjustment of an inking unit on the basis of a 
sensing of the printing plate in prescribed zones the 

printing ink supply is suppressed and in the remaining  
 

zones the ink supply is adjusted to fixed prescribed 
values 
Method according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the zonal supply of printing ink 

with the ductor continuing to run is wholly interrupted 
for a given period of time. 
Method according to claim 6 characterised in that with 
the ductor continuing to run the zonal supply as well as 

the total interruption of the zonal supply takes place 
periodically repeated in each case for a given period of 

time. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that with the ductor inking unit 

continuing to run with unchanged zonal ink supply a 
reduction of printing ink in the inking unit takes 

place. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that with a ductor inking unit with 

adjustable ductor rhythm the smallest possible ductor 
rhythm, i.e. smallest reduction of the ductor relative 

to the press, comes to be adjusted. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that with a ductor inking unit with 

adjustable ductor strip width the largest possible 
ductor strip width comes to be adjusted. 
Method according to claim 2, 3, 4 or 5 characterised in 
that coprinted on to the material to be printed in each 

zone are photoelectrically interrogatable measuring 
fields, wherein from the actual values of these in 

combination with predetermined desired values the 
respective quantities of printing ink to be supplied  

 
zonally are determined in each case, and that the supply 

of printing ink in the zones without printing ink supply 
takes place by a corresponding adjustment of the 

printing ink supply in neighbouring zones, wherein the 
adjustment of the corresponding quantities of the 

printing ink to be fed in the zones with printing ink 
supply takes place on the basis of a desired-actual 

comparison of the measured values in the zones with and 
without printing ink supply.
