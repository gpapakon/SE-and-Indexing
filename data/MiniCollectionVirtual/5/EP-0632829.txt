<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to novel, biologically active molecules which bind to and inhibit the thrombin receptor. The molecules of this invention are characterized by a portion which binds to the "hirudin-like" domain of the thrombin receptor (amino acids 52-69). These thrombin receptor antagonists are further characterized by their ability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation without affecting the catalytic activity of thrombin. More specifically, the thrombin receptor antagonist of this invention comprises the formula: Y-A1-W-X1-X2-X3-X4-A2-Z; wherein Y is hydrogen, a peptide of from 1 to 10 amino acids, either the same or different, or an acyl or alkyl chain comprising from 1 to 30 backbone atoms; each of A1 and A2, either the same or different, are selected from the group consisting of a positively charged amino acid and an acyl or alkyl chain comprising from 1 to 10 backbone atoms and a positively charged side group; W and each X is any amino acid, either the same or different; and Z is OH, a peptide of from 1 to 11 amino acids, either the same or different, or an acyl or alkyl chain comprising from 1 to 33 backbone atoms, with the proviso that at least one of W, X1 and X2 is not a basic amino acid; and wherein said antagonist is optionally cyclized by a covalent bond between Y and Z. This invention also relates to compositions and methods which employ these molecules for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes.

 THROMBIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTSTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel, biologically active molecules which bind to and inhibit the thrombin receptor. The molecules of this invention are characterized by a portion which binds to the "hirudin- like" domain of the thrombin receptor (amino acids 52-69) . These thrombin receptor antagonists are further characterized by their ability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation without affecting the catalytic activity of thrombin. More specifically, the thrombin receptor antagonist of this invention comprises the formula: Y-A,-W-X,-X2-X3-X4-A2-Z; wherein Y is hydrogen, a peptide of from 1 to 10 amino acids, either the same or different, or an acyl or alkyl chain comprising from 1 to 30 backbone atoms; each of A,and A2, either the same or different, are selected from the group consisting of a positively charged amino acid and an acyl or alkyl chain comprising from 1 to 10 backbone atoms and a positively charged side group; and each X is any amino acid, either the same or different; and Z is OH, a peptide of from 1 to 11 amino acids, either the same or different, or an acyl or alkyl chain comprising from 1 to 33 backbone atoms, and wherein said antagonist is optionally cyclized by a covalent bond between Y and Z; with the proviso that at least one of W, X, and X2 is not a basic amino acid. This invention also relates to compositions and methods which employ these molecules for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. 

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThrombin is a naturally occurring protein which has several bioregulatory roles [J. . Fenton, II, "Thrombin Bioregulatory Functions", Adv. Clin. Enzymol.. 6, pp. 186-93 (1988)]. In addition to being intimately involved in blood coagulation, thrombin is also known to play a role in platelet and endothelial cell activation, smooth muscle cell and neuroblast proliferation and bone resorption. Thrombin exerts its various biological effects through one of two mechanisms. The first is purely enzymatic, involving only the catalytic activity of thrombin. This is the mechanism by which thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, the final step in the coagulation cascade.The second mechanism of thrombin action is mediated through a cell surface receptor. This receptor has recently been cloned [T.-K. H. Vu et al., "Molecular Cloning of a Functional Thrombin Receptor Reveals a Novel Proteolytic Mechanism of Receptor Activation", Cell. 64, pp. 1057-68 (1991)]. It is believed that thrombin activates cells via
