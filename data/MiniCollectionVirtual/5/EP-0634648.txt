<ABSTRACT>
A detection unit (20), used as a scan box for the optronic inspection of a surface (12) along a sequence of mutually shifted parallel strips, especially for classification of rapidly moved work-pieces (11) such as planed timber sections, has a housing (19) having a light chamber (21.3) and a sensor chamber (21.4), extending parallel to the light chamber, for holding a sensor (15) substantially in the form of a linear-array camera having a long focal length. The imaging aperture (22.5), passed through orthogonally by the reception direction, (16) and the light aperture, (22.6) passed through orthogonally by the irradiation direction (17), in the housing (19) are closed by means of glass plates (24) which include an obtuse angle between each other, so that the strip-shaped beams intersect one another at a focus on the surface (12), which surface, in the orthogonal reception direction, thereby experiences an oblique irradiation direction (17), in order more reliably to detect low-contrast surface defects such as troughs, peaks and openings of holes through which direct viewing is not possible, by small shadow edges. The light source (18) can be equipped with high-frequency-supplied fluorescent tubes (32) in front of a cavity reflector (31) of extended trough shape; however it may more expediently be equipped with at least one point-like (or with an extended) DC-driven halogen lamp having a reflector. Preferably, beam deviation is carried out in the light chamber (21.3) in order to obtain a large separation between the lamp (33) and glass plate (24), and to make it possible to remove the dissipated heat by means of a fan (35) for forced air circulation (40) through the chambers (21) within the explosion-proof encapsulated housing (19).
