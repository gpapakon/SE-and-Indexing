doped semiconductor in which at least one MOS transistor (7, 

8) is formed, having its gate control input (12) linked to 
an input pad (13). The protection device (6) comprises a

connected between the said gate control input (12) and a 

reference terminal (9) of the integrated circuit. A 
thyristor (16) formed on the substrate is connected between 

the input pad (13) and the reference terminal (9). The 
control electrode (26) of this thyristor consists of a 

region of the substrate in such a way that the thyristor 
(16) can be fired by a current of charge carriers produced 

in the substrate by avalanche when a voltage rise occurs 
between the substrate and the terminal (17) of the turned-off 

MOS transistor (14) connected to the said gate control 
input (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the protection of the
inputs of integrated circuits against electrostatic discharges
(ESD) which may appear when they are handled.
The integrated circuits to be protected are MOS
circuits, i.e. including a substrate made of doped semiconductor
on which MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor)
transistors are formed, some of the transistors having
their gate control input linked to an input pad of the circuit.
The invention applies especially to CMOS (complementary
MOS)-type circuits.When the circuit is handled, electrostatic charges
may appear on the input pad and risk causing a discharge
(typically a few thousand volts for a few nanoseconds)
capable of destroying the gate oxide of the
transistors.The MOS transistor uses the effect of the electric
field through a thin oxide to bring about a conversion
into current of the voltage present on the gate. The growing
integration of technology leads to this oxide thickness
being reduced in order to obtain a better amplifying
power for the transistor, to the detriment of its capacity
to withstand high voltages. The inputs of CMOS integrated
circuits generally consist of control gates of MOS
transistors and exhibit both high impedance and great
sensitivity to electrostatic discharges.In orderto satisfy the laws of integration, thinner and
thinner gate oxides are produced nowadays, in which
the breakdown voltages from now on are less than 20
volts for the most advanced technology.The first protection devices used the avalanche regime
of diodes mounted in reverse mode between the
input pads and the Vss and Vcc power supply terminals.
As long as the avalanche voltage of these diodes remains
lower than the breakdown voltage of the gate oxide
of the MOS transistors, the energy of the electrostatic
discharge was able to be dissipated in the diodes. Unfortunately,
with technical evolution, the avalanche voltages
of these diodes have not fallen as much as the
breakdown voltages of the gate oxides of the transistors.
One solution frequently adopted is then the addition, in
series between the input pad and the gate of the transistor,
of a resistor which will form a time constant with
the capacitance of the MOS transistor.The use of turned-off MOS transistors in parallel
with the input also constitutes an interesting alternative.
During the electrostatic discharge, the voltage rises on
the drain, up to the avalanche regime of the junction. In
the case of a N+ diffusion for the drain, the holes thus
created by avalanche diffuse into the substrate.
