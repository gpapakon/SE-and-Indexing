<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a blood filter which is intended to be implanted in the circulation system for the purpose of trapping blood clots. This filter presents an axis (6) and comprises elastic flaps (4, 14) in the form of loops of flexible wire(s) which each define a surface area, these flaps issuing from a head (2) and being able to expand radially with respect to the axis. This filter is characterised in that its flaps define a first and a second series of flaps, the second series covering the first series. The surface area defined by any one of the loops (14) of the second series of flaps completely or partially covers at least the surface area defined by a subjacent loop (4) of the first series which it covers. The invention applies particularly to temporary filters and facilitates the opening and the withdrawal of the said filters.
