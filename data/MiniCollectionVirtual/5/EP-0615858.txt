<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to transparent sheets suitable for receiving images.
More specifically, the present invention is directed to transparent recording sheets particularly,
but not exclusively, suitable for use in electrophotographic imaging processes.Materials for transparencies, coatings for recording sheets and various imaging
processes are disclosed in the patent literature, see for example US-A-s: 5,118,570; 5,006,407;
5,145,749; 4,526,847; 3,619,279; 3,561,337; 3,493,412; 3,488,189; 4,956,225 and 4,997,697.
While those known materials and processes are suitable for their intended purposes, a need
remains for improved transparent recording sheets. In addition, a need remains for
transparent recording sheets particularly suitable for use in conjunction with electrostatic
toners. Further, there is a need for transparent recording sheets containing anti-static
components and exhibiting improved adhesion of an electrostatic toner image to the
recording sheet surface. Additionally, there is a need for transparent recording sheets
containing anti-slip components and exhibiting improved adhesion of an electrostatic toner
image to the recording sheet surface. There is also a need for transparent recording sheets
wherein both an anti-static component and an anti-slip component are contained in a single
coating layer of the sheet. Further, there is a need for transparent recording sheets wherein
the sheets exhibit superior transparency characteristics subsequent to formation of an image
thereon.EP-A-444,950 describes a transparent recording sheet coated with a mixture comprising a cellulose and a
non-cellulosic component.An object of the present invention is to strive to provide transparent recording sheets
with the above advantages.Accordingly, the present invention provides a recording sheet and an imaging
process in accordance with any one of the appended claims.In a preferred embodiment the transparent recording sheets are particularly suitable
for use in conjunction with electrostatic toners.In various embodiments of the present invention transparent recording sheets are
provided containing anti-static and/or anti-slip components and exhibiting improved adhesion
of an electrostatic toner image to the recording sheet surface.In one embodiment of the present invention transparent recording sheets are
provided wherein the sheets exhibit superior transparency characteristics subsequent to
formation of an image thereon.In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a transparent
