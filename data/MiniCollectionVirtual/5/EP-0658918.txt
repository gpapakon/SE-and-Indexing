<ABSTRACT>
In a plasma processing apparatus, wherein a power 
application electrode for generating plasma and an electrode 

opposed thereto are disposed in a process chamber which can be 
exhausted to attain a predetermined vacuum pressure, an 

electric power is applied to the power application electrode 
to generate the plasma from a process gas introduced between 

the electrodes, and intended plasma processing is effected on 
a substrate mounted on one of the electrodes in the plasma, 

the apparatus includes a particle discharge duct which 
surrounds a periphery and a rear side of the power application 

electrode and has an opening at a position neighboring to the 
periphery of the power application electrode, and an exhaust 

device connected to the duct at a position corresponding to a 
central portion of the rear side of the power application 

electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plasma processing 
apparatus such as a plasma chemical vapor deposition apparatus 
and a plasma etching apparatus, which are used for 
manufacturing semiconductor devices such as various kinds of 
sensors using semiconductor materials, thin film transistors, 
solar batteries and others, and for these purposes, are 
operable to form a film on a substrate or effect etching on a 
deposited film in accordance with a predetermined pattern, for 
example, for forming a wiring pattern. In the specification and the appended claims, the plasma 
chemical vapor deposition is referred to also as "plasma-CVD". Various types of plasma-CVD apparatuses have been known. As a typical example, a parallel plated plasma-CVD 
apparatus will be described below with reference to Fig. 9. 
This apparatus has a process chamber 1, in which electrodes 2 
and 3 opposed to each other are arranged. The electrode 2 also 
serves as a substrate holder for mounting a substrate S1 to be 
processed thereon. The electrode 2 is generally a ground electrode, and is 
provided with a heater 21 for heating the substrate S1 mounted 
on the electrode 2 to a deposition temperature. If radiated 
heat is used to heat the substrate S1, the heater 21 is  
 
separated from the electrode 2. The electrode 3 is a power application electrode for 
applying a radio-frequency power or a direct-current power to 
the deposition gas introduced between the electrodes 2 and 3 
for forming plasma from the gas. In this illustrated example, 
the electrode 3 is connected to a radio-frequency power source 
32 via a matching box 31, and is electrically isolated from 
the process chamber 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the electrode 3 includes 
as its component a gas nozzle 33 and a perforated electrode 
plate 34 provided at the opening of the nozzle 33. The 
perforated electrode plate 34 is provided with a large number 
of gas supply ports of about 0.5mm in diameter, through which 
a gas supplied from the gas nozzle 33 is discharged entirely 
into a space between the opposed electrodes. This structure is 
suitable for deposition of a film on a large area of the 
substrate. In the specification and the appended claims, "radio-frequency" 
may be referred to as "rf", and "radio-frequency 
power" may be referred to as "rf-power". The process chamber 1 is also connected to an exhaust 
pump 52 via a valve 51, and the gas nozzle 33 is connected to 
a gas supply 4 via a piping. The gas supply 4 includes one or 
more gas sources 441, 442, ...
