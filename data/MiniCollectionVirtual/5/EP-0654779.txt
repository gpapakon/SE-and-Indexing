<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multimedia system for 
the control and generation of music and two-and 
three-dimensional animation in real time, controlled by 
movement detectors. Various types of computerized electronic systems for 
generating and controlling sounds and images are known at 
present, as are such systems applied to the control of light 
effects, particularly for controlling discotheque equipment 
or for concert stage design. All these known systems are 
controlled by programs which, although they can be 
randomized, have no relation to the movements of one or more 
subjects on the stage. The present invention is intended to permit direct 
interaction between the movement executed by a subject on a 
"stage" and a set of sound, light and animation effects 
obtainable in real time. The subject of the present invention is therefore a 
multimedia system for the control and generation of music 
and two- and three-dimensional animation in real time, 
comprising: sensor means for movement detection; a unit for 
the acquisition and pre-processing of data detected by the 
said sensors; a unit for processing the acquired data, and 
one or more sound generation, and/or image generation and/or  
 
control, and/or light effects control units, controlled by 
the said data processing unit. The sound generation unit and the systems for image 
generation and light effects may be controlled directly by 
the acquisition and pre-processing unit. Advantageously, the said movement detection sensors may 
be thermal, electromagnetic, mechanical, infrared, 
ultrasonic or laser sensors, or an image acquisition system, 
singly or in combination with each other. Further advantages and characteristics of the present 
invention will be more clearly understood from the following 
detailed description of some preferred embodiments of the 
invention, shown by way of non-limiting example in the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the components 
of the system according to the present invention; Figure 2 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of the 
system according to the present invention. Figure 3 is a block diagram of a second, simplified 
embodiment of the system according to the invention, and Figure 4 is a block diagram of a third embodiment of the 
system according to the invention. With reference to the drawings, Figure 1 shows 
schematically the components used in one embodiment of the 
system of the invention. The number 1 indicates the sensors, 
for example
