<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to a method for 
polymerizing C₄-C₄₀ α-olefins alone or with other 

α-olefins in one or more steps using a Ziegler-Natta 
catalyst composition comprising a procatalyst, in 

which on a spray-crystallized support formed by a 
magnesium halide and a lower alcohol is deposited a 

titanium compound and an internal donor comprising 
an ester of a carboxylic acid with a long-chain alkyl 

group, said alkyl group being subjected to transesterification, 
and a cocatalyst made from a metallic 

compound of the I-III group of the periodic system 
of elements, and possibly including an external 

electron donor compound. The homo- or copolymer 
obtained by virtue of the method can be used for 

producing films, sheets, pipes, bottles and large 
containers. It is also suited for use in lubricating oils 

as a viscosity-reducing component. Further use of the 
polymer is found in coating, adhesive and cosmetic 

product formulas. The polymer is suited for use in 
different kinds of fuels and oils including such 

products as candles and similar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a method for polymerizing or copolymerizing C₄-C₄₀ 
α-olefins alone or with other α-olefins in one or more steps with the help of an 
transesterificated Ziegler-Natta catalyst composition comprising a titanium compound 
(called the procatalyst) deposited on spray-crystallized support formed by a magnesium 
halide and a lower alcohol and a cocatalyst made from a metallic compound of the I-III 
group of the periodic system of the elements. Conventionally, α-olefins have been polymerized with the help of different kinds of 
Ziegler-Natta catalyst compositions into solid polymers with a high molecular weight 
varying from several thousands to several millions. In general, the catalyst composition 
is formed by a procatalyst comprising a transition metal compound of the IV-VI subgroup 
of the periodic system of elements and a cocatalyst comprising an organometallic 
compound of the I-III major group the periodic system of elements. The transition 
metal conventionally is titanium, zirconium, vanadium and/or chromium, while in some 
cases also other metallic compounds of the above-mentioned groups are used alone or 
as different compositions. The cocatalyst metal conventionally is aluminum, and particularly 
the alkyl or alkyl halide compound of aluminum are frequently used. The 
transition metal compound may occur deposited onto an inert support which 
conventionally is an inorganic oxide such as silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, 
magnesium oxide, titanium oxide, chromium oxide or another inorganic salt or a 
mixture thereof. The support can also be a metal halide or organometallic compound 
such as, e.g., dialkyl or alkyl halide. Here, particularly magnesium compounds are 
conventionally used. The support can in its entirety or partially be formed by a fully 
organic compound such as a polymer including polyethene, polypropene and so on. A 
magnesium halide, particularly magnesium chloride or a derivative thereof is 
particularly suitable. The catalyst composition may also include other compounds which are incorporated in 
the catalyst as essential components thereof including different catalyst activity  
 
increasing substances or catalyst stereospecificity improving components, the most 
important of such being compounds called electron donors. Two types of the latter 
exist: compounds called internal donors, which are added during the preparation of 
procatalyst compositions, and compounds called external donors, which are added in 
conjunction with the cocatalyst to the
