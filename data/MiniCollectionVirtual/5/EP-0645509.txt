<ABSTRACT>
A lock for a trailer coupling which operates to 
secure the coupling against operation without any 

positive locking steps being taken. The lock 
comprises a spool (16) in a housing (10). The spool is 

urged by a spring (22) into the locking position where 
a bolt (18), axially aligned with the spool projects 

from end (14) of the housing (10). The lock is released 
by a key received in a keyhole at the other end of 

the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lock and more 
particularly, but not exclusively, a lock for use 
with trailer couplings and the like. Thefts of trailers whether coupled or uncoupled now 
present a serious security problem. One proposal 
for dealing with that problem is to make provision 
for some kind of lock such as a padlock to be fitted 
to the coupling which prevents the coupling being 
operated to detach the trailer from a vehicle and 
hitch it to another vehicle. The aforesaid 
proposals have been only partially successful in 
reducing trailer thefts because locking of the 
coupling requires some positive action on the part of 
the trailer owner, such as fitting the padlock and 
turning a key. Even these minimal tasks are 
frequently seen as being too irksome and hence thefts 
of trailers still occur. There is, therefore, a need for some locking 
provision which will secure a coupling without the 
need for any positive operation on the part of the 
user. The present invention has been made in order 
to solve this problem. According to the invention there is provided a lock  
 
comprising a housing, a locking spool movable in said 
housing between a locking position and an unlocked 
position, means for urging the spool into the locking 
position, means for releasably locking the spool to 
the housing in the locking position and a locking 
bolt fixed to the spool and extending outwardly 
through the housing, whereby movement of the spool 
causes corresponding movement in the same direction 
of the locking bolt. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the 
housing and the spool are of corresponding cross-section 
which is preferably circular although other 
shapes can be adopted if required. The housing 
preferably takes the form of a cylinder which is open 
at one end to permit partial withdrawal therefrom of 
the spool. The locking bolt is fixed at the end of 
the spool adjacent the closed end of the cylinder and 
extends through an aperture in said closed end. 
Preferably the locking bolt is co-axially mounted on 
the spool. Preferably means may be provided for 
limiting the extent of travel of the spool within the 
housing. In addition means may also be provided for 
preventing the spool from rotating within the 
housing. The lock of the invention is particularly suitable 
for use with trailer couplings. It can be mounted  
 
on a part of the coupling housing so that the locking 
bolt is receivable in an aperture in the coupling 
mechanism thereby preventing the coupling mechanism 
from being

<CLAIMS>
A lock comprising a housing, a locking spool 
movable in said housing between a locking position 

and an unlocked position, means for urging the spool 
into the locking position, means for releasably 

locking the spool to the housing in the locking 
position and a locking bolt fixed to the spool and 

extending outwardly through the housing, whereby 
movement of the spool causes corresponding movement 

in the same direction of the locking bolt. 
A lock as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the housing 
and spool are of complimentary cross-section which is 

preferably circular. 
A lock as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein 
the housing is open at one end to permit at least 

partial withdrawal of the spool. 
A lock as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the locking 
bolt is fixed to the other end of the spool. 
A lock as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
means are provided for preventing rotation of the 

spool in the housing. 
A lock as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
 

the means for releasably locking the spool to the 
housing is key operated. 
A lock as claimed in any preceding claim in 
combination with a trailer coupling. 
The combination as claimed in Claim 7, wherein 
the trailer coupling includes a housing and a 

coupling mechanism and wherein the lock is mounted on 
the housing for engagement with the trailer 

mechanism.
