<ABSTRACT>
This is a device intended to inform the users of a bus network about the waiting times for buses at the stops of the network, which devices comprise a central set capable of transmitting radio signals relating to the actual instantaneous positions of the buses and portable receiver units (1) capable of displaying the waiting times on screens (4). Each unit can itself serve as ticket or travel pass, it carrying for this purpose (at 10) a "validity" datum (corresponding to a sum of money or to an end-of-subscription date) which can be inspected remotely by ticket-validating machines (9) and which can itself be "reloaded" remotely from the central set.

<CLAIMS>
An installation for enabling users of a transport 
network to pay sums corresponding to trips performed by 

the users on board vehicles travelling over the network, 
the installation comprising firstly travel tickets (1) 

made available to users in return for payment, each of 
the tickets including means for recording thereon 

quantifiable validity data or the equivalent 
corresponding to the payment made, and means responsive 

to remotely transmitted signals making it possible to 
implement successive reductions in the validity data, if 

quantifiable, until it has been reduced to zero, or else 
to consult said data; and also at least one ticket-stamper 

(9) located close to a passage giving access to 
the network, which ticket-stamper includes means 

responsive to presentation by a user of one 
of said tickets for authorizing a given trip over 

tne network, for remotely checking the validity state of 
said ticket and for remotely subtracting a quantity 

corresponding to the trip in question from the validity 
data recorded in the ticket, if said data is 

quantifiable, the installation being characterized in 
that it further comprises, on each ticket, coded 

identification means for said ticket and coded means 
lending themselves to renewing validity data remotely 

into said ticket in response to receiving suitable 
electromagnetic signals, and, at a central station (2), 

means suitable for transmitting electromagnetic signals 
(S) to the tickets to be renewed, which signals are 

generated in such a manner as to enable them to be 
automatically selectable by said tickets and being 

suitable for remotely renewing the validity data in said 
tickets. 
An installation according to claim 1, applicable to a 
bus network, comprising firstly portable appliances (1) 

for receiving electromagnetic signals (S) and organized  
 

so as to display waiting times for a bus to be caught, 
and secondly a central station (2) suitable for 

generating and transmitting to the appliances 
electromagnetic signals that convey data relating to said 

waiting times, the installation being characterized in 
that the renewable tickets are constituted by the said 

appliances themselves. 
An installation according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it is applied to paying tolls for a motorway 

network. 
An installation according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each ticket includes key means 

enabling use of the ticket during ticket-stamping to be 
subject to the user keying in a secret code.
