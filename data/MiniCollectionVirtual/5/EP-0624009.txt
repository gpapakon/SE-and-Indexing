<ABSTRACT>
An automatic offset control circuit comprises a 
differential output preamplifier (102) having an offset 

adjustment function, further comprising an average detector 
(106), a peak detector (107), and a differential input amplifier 

(108). The average detector (106) generates a reference voltage 
representing an average value of a positive output (V+) and a 

negative output (V-) of the preamplifier (102). The peak 
detector (107) outputs a peak voltage representing a peak of the 

negative output (V-) of the preamplifier (102). The 
differential input amplifier (108) compares the peak voltage 

with the reference voltage to output an offset adjustment signal 
to the preamplifier (102). The offset adjustment signal is 

obtained based on a difference between the reference voltage and 
the peak voltage. A bottom detector (109) may be used instead of 

the peak detector (107), provided a bottom value is detected 
using the positive output of the preamplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic offset 
control circuit for a digital receiver in a digital transmission 
system such as an optical subscriber transmission system, an 
optical local area network (LAN), or an optical interconnection 
apparatus. In general, an optical digital receiver is comprised of a 
photodetector module and a monolithic integrated circuit for 
receiving the detected signal to regenerate it. Since the 
integrated circuit includes amplifiers which are direct-current 
coupled, it is very important to solve the offset-voltage 
problem stemming from variation of its power supply voltage and 
ambient temperature. Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a 
conventional optical receiver for continuous signals which is 
widely used. The signal detected by the photodetector 1 is 
amplified by a differential output preamplifier 2 and then 
regenerated by a regenerating circuit 3. The optical receiver 
employs an automatic offset control circuit comprising peak 
detectors 6 ,7 and a differential input amplifier 6. The peak 
detectors 6 and 7 detect peak values of positive and negative 
output voltages of a preamplifier 2, respectively. The  
 
differential input amplifier 6 receives the peak values and 
outputs the difference voltage between these values to the 
preamplifier 2 to cancel out an offset voltage thereof. However, the above-mentioned control is inappropriate for 
burst signals as shown in Figure 9A with power level subject to 
more rapid changes than the time constant of the automatic 
offset control circuit. The reason is that the offset control 
is properly performed only for pulse series having the maximum 
power level within a period equal to the time constant of the 
automatic offset control circuit as shown in Figure 9B, so that 
other pulse series may have a high probability of being 
recognized as space by the regenerating circuit 3. Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating a conventional 
basic structure of an optical receiver suitable for burst 
signals. Figure 3 is a block diagram showing a conventional 
embodiment of such an optical receiver. The receiver shown in 
Figure 2 employs an automatic offset control circuit comprising 
the peak detector 4, a bottom detector 8 and the differential 
input amplifier 6. The peak detector 6 detects a peak value of 
negative output of the preamplifier 2 and the bottom detector 8 
detects a bottom value of positive output thereof. Such an offset control is suitable for a burst signal with 
a power level
