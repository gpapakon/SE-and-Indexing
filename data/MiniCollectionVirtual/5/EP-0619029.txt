<ABSTRACT>
An electro-optical system according to the preamble of claim 1 is described in which the angle  psi  formed by the polarization device on the inlet side with the liquid cristal molecule directors on the first substrate surface is optimized to achieve high contrast and/or high brightness and/or contrast and chromaticity which are highly independent of viewing angle.

Electro-optical system comprising 

a twisted nematic liquid-crystal layer between two 
substrates provided on the inside with electrode 

layers and alignment layers thereon, where the 
liquid crystal has a homeotropic or parallel edge 

alignment, the latter with a twist angle of 
0° ≤ β ≤ 600°, and 
one or more compensation layers based on a sequence 
of optically positive layers, and 
at least one device for linear polarization of the 
light in such an arrangement that the light passes 

through a polarization device at least once before 
entering and at least once after exiting the liquid-crystal 

layer, 
 
characterized in that the compensation layer is based on 

a material having three optical refractive indices, of 
which one is lower than the other two, where the axis 

corresponding to the lower refractive index forms an 
angle of 2° ≤ τ ≤ 60° with the electrode surface so that 

the angle between the optical axis of the compensation 
layer and the addressable liquid-crystal layer passes 

through a minimum on application of a voltage, and the 
plane set up by the other two refractive indices forms an 

angle of between 30° and 150° with the directors of the 
liquid-crystal molecules of the liquid-crystal layer at  

 
the surfaces facing one another. 
Electro-optical system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the compensation layer is based on 

a sequence of optically positive layers with alternating
