<ABSTRACT>
A rotor mounted on a stand (10, 15) and placed under the outlet 
section of a spray nozzle (11) for cooling tower is described, which 

uniformly distribute the water which goes out from said outlet 
section. 
The substantially conical rotor rotates by the action of the water 
which goes out from said outlet section urging a series of fins (3) 

present on its surface; the rotor main body (4) is provided, 
starting from the external edge, with one or more series of 

equidistant cavities (5, 6, 7, 8) having different depth and an 
arc profile similar to the fins one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a spray nozzle for a cooling tower comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1. Such as
spray nozzle
allows an unform distribution of the water coming out from the
nozzle outlet on the inner section of the tower and in particular on
the upper surface of the heat exchange element normally contained in
a cooling tower in order to increase the water/air contact surface
and then the cooling efficiency.A cooling tower is a particular cooling plant used in numerous
fields of technics and industry (thermoelectric, petrochemical etc.)
to dissipate the heat present in the cooling water.In the cooling towers the water to be cooled is sprayed on the tower
top and during its falling it meets an air stream to which it
transfers a heat quantity by partially vaporizing.Said air stream may be generated by one or more sucking fans placed
on the tower top and/or by one or more blowing fans placed on the
cooling tower bottom, or this air stream could be generated by the
natural draught due to air density differences.The evaporation allows to cool the water to a temperature lower than
the air inlet temperature. In order to increase the air/water
contact surface, and then the cooling tower efficiency, the tower
casing is at least partially filled with one or more layers of a 
"honeycomb" material (or of another equivalent material) which
foresees an upper chamber where a plurality of spray nozzles are
placed and a lower chamber where a sink for collecting the cooled
water is placed.Coooling towers provided with spray nozzles having means suitable
for more uniformly distribute water which has to be cooled on the
whole inner section of the tower are known in the art.In a possible embodiment (e.g. as described in US-A-5 143 657) said
distributing means comprises at least a disk-shaped mobile element,
showing a plurality of fins on both sides, which is rotated by the
water to be cooled coming out from the nozzle and urging the fins
present on one side; in this case the centrifugal force spreads out
said water on a larger surface. Said known distributing elements are
quite expensive and complicated since for instance the mobile
element is kept by means of a fixed element receiving a part of the
water to be cooled through a hole placed in the center of the mobile
element. In this case, a part of the water urging the fixed element
is further dispersed and the balance is deviated towards the fins
present on the other side of the mobile element; these fins spread
out the coming water by means of the
