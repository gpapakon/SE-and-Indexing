Process for the purpose of cross folding
sheets, having a leading half (44) and a trailing half

(47), to form signatures (42) in a folder, having a
collecting cylinder (9) and a jaw cylinder (11), which

sheets are retained on the collecting cylinder (9), in
the initial region (43) of their leading half (44), by

retaining devices (17) of said collecting cylinder, and
are then additionally retained by a folding blade (14)

penetrating into folding jaws (21) of the jaw cylinder
(11), characterized in that the end (48) of the

trailing half (47) of the sheet is always kept free on
the collecting cylinder (9), in that, in a region (Â±e)

of the point of intersection (S) of an imaginary plane
(41) connecting the axes of rotation of the cylinders

(9, 11) and a tangent (T) to the circumference of the
collecting cylinder (9), in each case a trailing half

(47) of the signatures (42) is gripped, and secured, on
the jaw cylinder (11) in its end region (48) by a

controllable securing device (23; 49) of the jaw
cylinder (11), in that subsequently in each case the

initial region (43) of the first, leading half (44) of
the signatures (42) is released by the retaining

devices (17) of the collecting cylinder (9) at the
latest when the latter is at zero speed, or near zero

speed, and then remains free, in that thereafter, the
start (43) and end (48) of the signatures (42) retained

in folding jaws (21) in each case are located more or
less one above the other, and in that, finally, in each

case the securing device (23, 49) of the jaw cylinder
(11) releases the trailing half (47) of each signature

(42) on the jaw cylinder again.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the securing device (23, 49) grips in each case

the trailing half (47) of the signatures (42), as seen
in the direction of rotation (A) of the jaw cylinder

(11), as it passes the point of intersection (S) of the
plane (41) and the tangent (T). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the securing device (23, 49) grips in each case

the trailing half (47) of the signatures (42), as seen
in the direction of rotation (A) of the jaw cylinder

(11), into [sic] a region (e plus) after it passes the

point of intersection (S).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the securing device (23, 49) grips in each case

the trailing half (47) of the signatures (42), as seen
in the direction of rotation (A) of the jaw cylinder

(11), into [sic] a region (e minus) before it passes

the point of intersection (S).
Process according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the retaining devices (17) of the

collecting cylinder (9) release in each case the start
(43) of the leading half (44) of the signatures (42) at

the earliest after the folding blades (14) have
penetrated fully into the folding jaws (21) of the jaw

cylinder (11).
Process according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the controllable securing device

(23) grips in each case an end (48) of the trailing
half (47) of the signatures (42) in the vicinity of the

end border (51) of said half.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the controllable securing device

(49) grips in each case an end (48) of the trailing
half (47) of the signatures (42) in the region of the

side borders (52, 53) of said half.
Process according to Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that, in the run-out interstice of the

collecting cylinder (9) and jaw cylinder (11), the
leading end (44) is guided along a product-directing

device (26).
Folding apparatus for carrying out the process
according to Claims 1 to 8,
 it being the case that
controllable grippers (23, 49), which act on the region

of the end border (51) of the second half (47) of the
sheets (42), are assigned to the folding jaws (21) of 

the jaw cylinder (11) at an arcuate distance (b), on
the jaw-cylinder circumference, behind the folding jaws

(21) in each case, as seen in the direction of rotation
(A) of the jaw cylinder (11), characterized in that a

side-framework-mounted product-directing device (26)
for a leading half (44) of the sheet is provided in the

run-out interstice of the collecting cylinder (9) and
jaw cylinder (11).
Apparatus for carrying out the process
according to Claim 9, characterized in that the

product-directing device (26) can be adjusted.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the form of the product-directing device (26)

can be changed.
