<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic brush development 
apparatus (10) for applying developer material to a latent 

image on a moving image carrying member (12) 
includes a housing (14) having a 

portion defining a sump (S) adapted to contain a supply of 
developer material, and a magnetic brush (36) located 

within the housing (14) in spaced relation to 
the sump portion (S) for applying developer material to the 

latent image. A feed mechanism (60) including a metering 
assembly (50) located within the housing (14) between the sump 

portion (S) and the magnetic brush (36) transports developer 
material from the sump (S) to the magnetic brush (36), and a 

mechanism (26) located in the sump portion (S) agitates 
developer material and transports developer material to 

the feed mechanism (60). A take-off skive (74) for stripping 
development material from the magnetic brush (36) after 

application to a latent image and directing such 
material to the sump portion (S) is mounted so that the 

skive (74) is self-adjustably supported between the metering 
assembly (50) and the magnetic brush (36). In order to enhance 

the mixing of developer material, flow of developer 
material is directed from the wall of the housing 

adjacent to the sump portion back into the agitating 
and transport mechanism. Further, developer material in 

the sump portion (S) is replenished by a device which 
includes a reservoir (72) for replenishment material 

adjacent to the sump portion (S), a flow communication path (18a) 
between the reservoir (72) and the sump portion (S) and a 

selectively rotatable roller (90) located relative to the 
path to control flow of replenishment material through 

the path. Measuring the 
level of replenishment material in the reservoir is 

facilitated by the material monitor (94) located in the 
bottom of the reservoir (72) immediately upstream of the 

flow communication path. Still further, a 
shield (44) is located upstream of the development zone 

between the housing (14) and the image carrying member (12) for 
containing developer material within the development 

zone to substantially prevent escape of airborne 
particulate material from the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to electrostatographic 
reproduction apparatus, and more particularly 
to an improved magnetic brush development 
apparatus for an electrostatographic reproduction 
apparatus. Magnetic brush development apparatus for 
applying developer material to a latent image in an 
electrostatographic reproduction apparatus are well 
known in the art. Such apparatus may include a housing 
having a sump portion which contains a supply of 
developer material. When the developer material 
comprises a mixture of magnetic carrier particles and 
smaller pigmented marking particles, the material in 
the sump is agitated to triboelectrically charge the 
material prior to delivering it to a magnetic brush 
where it can be brought into association with, and 
transferred to, an electrostatic latent image to 
develop such image. U.S.-A-4,671,207 discloses a magnetic 
brush development apparatus particularly suitable for 
use with developer material having pigmented marking 
particles and permanent magnetic carrier particles. 
More particularly, the disclosed apparatus include a 
ribbon blender that is used for agitating (mixing), 
feeding and triboelectrically charging such material in 
the sump portion of a magnetic brush development 
apparatus, and a feed mechanism that delivers material 
from the sump portion to a magnetic brush. The 
material delivered to the magnetic brush is applied to 
the latent electrostatic image in a development zone to 
develop the image. The ribbon blender is constructed to 
provide uniform flow distribution of developer 
material across the length of the apparatus so that a  
 
sufficient supply of material is delivered to the 
magnetic brush over its full extent to uniformly 
develop the entire latent electrostatic image. A 
take-off skive, in contact with the magnetic brush 
downstream of the development zone, strips excess 
developer material from the magnetic brush and returns 
such material to the sump portion. Since the pigmented marking particles are used 
during image development, replenishment of the 
developer material must be periodically effected. 
Typical replenishment devices include a reservoir for 
replenishment material with a flow communication path 
between the reservoir and the sump of the of the 
development apparatus. A selectively actuable member, 
such as a roller, controls flow of replenishment 
material through the path. It has been found that under 
certain conditions the set up latitude between the 
replenishment roller and the flow
