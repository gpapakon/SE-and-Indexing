<ABSTRACT>
A cooling system for reducing the temperature of an 
exhaust-impinged structural panel includes an upper, primary 

cooling panel having boundary layer film-forming openings 
therein, a middle, secondary cooling panel having openings for 

directing a flow of cooling fluid into impingement with the 
primary cooling panel, and a lower cooling panel. The lower and 

upper panels together delimit a truss structure which 
structurally reinforces the cooling system, and the lower panel 

forms with the upper panel channels for conducting pressurized 
fluid first to the openings of the secondary cooling panel and 

then to the openings of the primary cooling panel. A method is 
also disclosed and claimed for fabricating the upper and lower 

cooling panels unitarily with the middle cooling panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus
for cooling panel structures, and more particularly to a method
and apparatus for the cooling of aircraft structures located
rearwardly of the engine bay doors in the flow of hot, corrosive
jet engine exhaust gases.Typically, exhaust impinged aircraft structures located
rearwardly of engine bays in the flow of hot, corrosive jet
engine exhaust are subjected to acoustic, pressure and thermal
loads not ordinarily encountered in either conventional airframe
designs or in engines. The design of exhaust impinged structures, contrasted
with hot sections of engines, is dependent on thermal and
geometric constraints. For example, exhaust-impinged structures
are typically exposed to temperatures in the range of from about
538°C (1000° F) for a bomber to about 1613°C (3000°F) for a fighter. Moreover,
engine sections can generally be designed to minimize the thermal
stresses, while design of the hot exhaust-impinged structures
have configurations which rely on other considerations, such as
infrared signature (IR) or Radar Cross Section (RCS) constraints.
And as a rule, exhaust-impinged structures are required to
conform to the surrounding aircraft structure. Such constraints
increase the thermal stresses that lead to failure. Non-uniform
heating and relatively low thermal conductivity aggrevate the
thermal stress distribution, and additional problems are
encountered, including low-cycle fatigue and increases in the
mean stresses and buckling. Exhaust-impinged structures are used in a complex and
demanding service environment. At the surface exposed to the
engine exhaust stream, the environment may be oxygen-depleted
with respect to air, but it is still an oxidizing environment.
Fuel additives may increase the corrosivity of the exhaust stream
for the particular propulsion system. The temperature of the aft
deck substructure varies from the ambient air temperature before
takeoff to the temperature of any cooling air used or to
temperatures approaching those of an uncooled deck, and therefore
significant thermal gradients occur within the structure.Material characteristics, too, place substantial
constraints on the aircraft engine and airframe system
integration capability. For example, without cooling, the
baseline material typically used, Ti-6Al-4V, has insufficient
high temperature strength, creep resistance, fatigue resistance
and resistance to cyclic oxidation. The fatigue resistance of a
structure cycled to high temperatures, with uneven heating, is
related
