<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for making 
polycarbonate by phosgenating a mixture of bisphenol 

and phenolic chain-stopper under interfacial reaction 
conditions in the presence of a phase transfer 

catalyst. A polycarbonate is obtained which is 
substantially free of diarylcarbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to copending application RD-22,333
(USSN 08/066,382) and RD-22,841 (USSN 08/066,381) filed
concurrently herewith.The present invention relates to a method
for making phenolic chain-stopped polycarbonate which
is substantially free of diarylcarbonate. More
particularly, the present invention relates to the
employment of a phase transfer catalyst during the
phosgenation of bisphenol to produce chloroformate
terminated polycarbonate, followed by the addition of
an amount of phenolic chain-stopper substantially
equivalent to the chloroformate terminal groups.Experience has shown that during the
preparation of polycarbonates by the phosgenation of
bisphenols under interfacial reaction conditions
utilizing aromatic hydroxy chain-stoppers, such as
phenol, diarylcarbonate is often formed as a by-product.
Because diarylcarbonate can plate out during
injection molding procedures, it represents an
undesirable contaminant in certain polycarbonate
applications, such as CD grade polycarbonate.As shown by U.S. patents 4,737,573,
4,743,676 and 5,043,203, various techniques have been
used to minimize the formation of diaryl carbonates
during phosgenating procedures for making end-capped 
polycarbonates. In one procedure, a bischloroformate
oligomer is prepared utilizing an excess of 1.1-3.0
moles of phosgene, per mole of bisphenol. A phenolic
chain-stopper, such as phenol, and a condensation
catalyst can be added to the mixture. In another
procedure, a phenolic chain-stopper is added to a
bischloroformate oligomer to produce a partially
capped bischloroformate, followed by the addition of
an interfacial polycarbonate condensation catalyst. A
further procedure for making aromatic polycarbonate
substantially free of diarylcarbonate is by forming an
oligomeric bisphenol monochloroformate, and then
incorporating an end-capping phenol, tertiary organic
amine and additional alkali metal hydroxide into the
mixture.Although several prior art procedures have
been found effective for minimizing diarylcarbonate
formation, experience has shown that an excessive
amount of phosgene or chloroformate end groups are
necessarily consumed before polycarbonate molecular
weight build-up can be achieved. It would be
desirable therefore to provide a method for making
polycarbonates substantially free of diarylcarbonate
without excessive consumption of phosgene,
chloroformate end groups or both.The present invention is based on the
discovery that polycarbonate substantially free of
diarylcarbonate can be made by substituting

<CLAIMS>
A method for making polycarbonate having
a predetermined molecular weight which is substantially

free of diarylcarbonate, which comprises,

(1) adding phosgene to a bisphenol under
interfacial reaction conditions at a pH in the range of

10 to 12 in the presence of an amount of a phase
transfer catalyst which is effective for catalysing

reaction between the phosgene and the bisphenol until 1
to 70 mole % of phosgene has been added, based on the

total moles of available arylhydroxy of the bisphenol,
(2) lowering the pH of the mixture of (1),
to a value in the range of 8.0 to 9.0, and while

maintaining such pH range, continuing to add phosgene
to the mixture until up to a 2 mole % excess of

phosgene has been introduced which is at least adequate
to generate sufficient chloroformate end groups capable

of reacting with available bisphenol hydroxy groups
and the calculated moles of hydroxy in the phenolic

chain-stopper hydroxy groups sufficient to provide a
polycarbonate having a predetermined molecular weight,
(3) introducing into the resulting mixture,
the calculated moles of phenolic chainstopper

sufficient to achieve the desired polycarbonate
molecular weight range,
(4) raising the pH of the phosgenation
mixture to a value in the range of 10 to 12, and
(5) eliminating any excess chloroformate
groups in the resulting mixture.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the bisphenol is bisphenol A.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the phase transfer catalyst is

tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium
bromide or tetrabutylammonium chloride.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the chain-stopping phenol is cumyl phenol.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where in step 5, the reaction mixture is further

agitated, or phenols are added to effect removal of
chloroformates.
