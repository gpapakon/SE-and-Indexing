<ABSTRACT>
System and method for digitally generating a pulse 
width modulated (PWM) signal with dither based on a command 

signal, the signal having a pulse width proportional to the 
command signal. In the preferred embodiment, the PWM signal 

with proportional dither energizes a load, such as a 
variable force solenoid, with a desired electrical current. 

The system includes a base signal generator (30) for 
generating a base signal having a pulse width which is based 

on a command signal representing the desired electrical 
current. The system also includ
es a dither signal generator 
(32) for digitally generating a dither signal having a pulse 

width proportional to the command signal, and a summer (50) 
for combining the base signal and the dither signal to 

obtain the pulse width modulated signal with proportional 
dither.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pulse width modulated
signals for driving solenoids and, more particularly, to
proportional low frequency modulated signals for driving
solenoids.Many existing vehicular control modules include an
analog driver circuit, frequently referred to as the
variable force solenoid (VFS) driver circuit, used in
conjunction with automatic transmission variable force
solenoids. In some embodiments, the VFS driver is a
separate analog integrated circuit located apart from the
digital input/output (I/O) chip. As is known, the analog
driver circuit essentially provides a variable duty cycle
output signal to the solenoid, in response to a binary
command word from a microprocessor. For example, the pulse
width modulated (PWM) signal may have a range of 5-15 kHz
with about 5% - 95% duty cycle. Typically, the duty cycle
is 5% - 55%.Fixed PWM has associated problems, because of
hysteresis effects in the solenoid. To remedy this problem,
and to improve linearity, a "dither" signal is added to the
PWM signal. For example, the VFS driver circuit typically
adds a low frequency (e.g. 200 Hz) signal that is
approximately 10% of the desired solenoid current.US 5 079 498 A
issued to Cleasby
et al., discloses a combination analog/digital (i.e. hybrid)
PWM generator with dither for current control. The
reference teaches the use of analog circuits and digital
circuits to generate a square wave PWM voltage drive to a
load. The resulting current is sensed and a corresponding
voltage is fedback and compared with two zone boundary
voltage levels, which are spaced equally above and below a
signal representing the desired output current. Based on
the comparison (i.e. when the voltage feedback reaches
either boundary level), a switching circuit is switched from
ON to OFF. When dither is incorporated, the zone width is 
based on stored half-zone width values which are selected
based on the dither phase. The Cleasby et al. reference
however, does not teach use of an entirely digital circuit
to generate a dither signal that is proportional to the
desired output signal.As future generation vehicular control modules are
developed and control of the vehicle operation becomes more
precise, the number of VFS driver circuits required is
expected to increase. Additionally, the trend in future
generation controllers is to employ all digital I/O chips.
Continued use of conventional analog solenoid drivers, and
hybrid drivers such as that described in the '498 reference,
will present problems due to the difficulty of
