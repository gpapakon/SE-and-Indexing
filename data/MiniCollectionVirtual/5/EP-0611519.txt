<ABSTRACT>
The transplanting machine includes, grouped together on one and the same chassis (1) forming a module, a vertical chute (10) in which the blocks (earth balls) (6) are located. These blocks (6) are taken up by means of a system of radiating grippers (7) at the lower part of the chute. The first block is held at the lower part of the chute (10) by means of a limit stop (14) and a retaining member (15) in a form of a flexible strip compresses the block (6) against a fold (12) made on the face of the chute. The limit stop (14) and the retaining member (15) are operated by one and the same lever (17) which is actuated by a system of cams (24) of the dual-acting type, by means of a rocker member (23) and of a link rod (21) which transmits the movement.

<CLAIMS>
A transplanter for seedling blocks, of the type comprising - a distribution chute
(10) in which are juxtaposed in column the said blocks (6), - means for picking-up the first

block at the downstream extremity of the chute, in the form of rotary claws (7), whose motion
is synchronised to the forward motion of the machine, - means whose operation is

synchronised to immobilise the blocks in the said chute, comprising a removable stop (14)
arranged at the extremity of the chute to retain the first block of the said column and a

retaining unit (15) arranged above the said removable stop to act from the second block of the
chute, characterised in that on the one hand, the chute (10) exhibits a U-shaped section

completed, at least at its downstream section, by folds (12) formed at the extremity of the
lateral branches of the said U and oriented inwards, to cover partially the top section of the

blocks on both sides of the seedling, and in that, on the other hand, the retaining unit (15)
which is formed as a flexible blade, is arranged at the bottom (13) of the said chute, to

compress the blocks from the second block at least against the said folds (12) of the chute.
A transplanter according to claim 1, characterised in that the stop (14) and the
control means of the retaining unit (15) are gathered on the same lever (17) articulated round

an axis (18) transversal and horizontal, situated at the lower rear section of the chute (10),
whereas the said lever (17) comprises a crank (22) actuated via a rod (21) using a system of

cams (24), whose motion is synchronised to that of the claws (7).
A transplanter according to claim 1, characterised in that the control means of the
retaining unit (15) are arranged on a lever (17) articulated round a transversal horizontal axis

(18) and situated at the lower rear section of the chute (10), and in that the stop (14) is
interconnected to an axis (48) arranged at the same level as the axis (18), at the rear, whereby

the said stop (14) is mobile under the effect of a cam control system, using a cam (49)
interconnected to the axis (18), actuated by the crank (22) of the lever (17), and which enables

to delay the motion of the stop (14) with respect to the actuation of the retaining unit (15).
A transplanter according to any of the claims 2 or 3, characterised in that the lever
(17) consists of an extension in the form of a pusher which actuates the retaining unit (15) via 

a compression spring (16) and recalls the said unit (15) via a pin (20) situated at the extremity
of a spindle (19) serving to guide the said spring, whereby the said spindle (19) is

interconnected to the said unit (15).
A transplanter according to claim 2, characterised in that it comprises a system of
cams (24) consisting of a centre plate (241) and of an external crown (242), concentric and

coplanar, assembled by bridges (28), delineating with respect to one another, a path (29)
whose profile makes up the cam properly speaking, and in which is guided a follower (27).
A transplanter according to claim 5, characterised in that the lever (17) is
controlled by the follower (27) installed on a toggle lever (23) and by a rod (21) interposed

between both of them.
A transplanter according to claim 5, characterised in that the claws (7) and the
system of cams (24), are arranged on the same axis (8) placed at the centre and at the upper

section of the chassis (1).
A transplanter according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that it
comprises, at each planting module, a chute (10) vertical, interconnected to a chassis (1)

comprising :

a front wheel (2) serving as a reference on the ground;
a ploughshare (3) situated under the said chute (10) and under the pick-up means in the form
of irradiating claws (7);
stamping wheels (5) arranged at the rear serving to adjust the planting depth of the blocks;
linking means with a main frame (30) which may contain several planting modules.
A transplanter according to claim 8, characterised in that the linking means of the
chassis (1) with the main frame (30) consist of a rigid beam (31) articulated on the chassis (1)

round a horizontal transversal axis (32) and on the frame round a similar axis.
A transplanter according to claim 9, characterised in that it comprises means to
raise the module, in the form of an additional arm (34), arranged parallel to the beam (31)

between the frame (30) and the chassis (1), with sufficient clearance to clear the chassis (1)
during the planting phases.
