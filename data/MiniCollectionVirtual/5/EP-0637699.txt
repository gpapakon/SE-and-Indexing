<ABSTRACT>
An elastic block (1) made from an elastic material and having elongated cavities (2) which are arranged in pairs in a plurality of planes, and are situated opposite one another and open at one end. Such elastic blocks are used for mounting and suspending machines, motors or similar technical apparatuses. The known elastic blocks frequently tend to buckle or stiffen, or can be produced only with a high outlay. The novel elastic block is intended to be simpler to produce and to guarantee sufficient insulation from structure-borne sound and sufficient resistance to buckling in conjunction with a continuously rising elastic characteristic. For this purpose, the novel elastic block has as damping channels cavities (2) which are open at one end, narrow towards the opening, are of conical or drop-shaped design and whose longitudinal axes extend parallel to one another.

A resilient body (1) of an elastic material, whose main 
loading direction lies parallel to its central axis (3) and 

all of whose cavities (2) lying perpendicularly to the 
central axis (3) are elongate and arranged in several planes 

lying at right angles to the central axis (3), characterised 
in that all these cavities (2) are open on one side and 

arranged opposite each other in pairs in each plane and taper 
towards the opening in such a way that they are of conical or 

tear-shaped construction, such that, when they are loaded in 
the main loading direction, the internal walls, opposing each 

other in this direction, of each of these cavities come into 
contact, and in that the longitudinal axes (L) of all these 

cavities (2) extend parallel with each other. 
A resilient body (1) according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the cavities (2) of one plane are staggered with 

respect to the cavities (2) of an adjacent plane by half the 
distance (A) between the longitudinal axes (L) of the 

cavities (2) of one plane. 
A resilient body according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the respective central cavities (2) of 

one plane are shorter than the outer cavities (2). 
A resilient body according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the inner ends of the cavities (2) are hemispherical in 

shape and the middle points (M) of the hemispherical ends are 
concentric with respect to the central axis (3) of the 

resilient body (1).  
 
A resilient body according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it has a hole (4) running through it 

which is arranged at right angles to the longitudinal axes 
(L) of the cavities (2). 
A resilient body according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the hole (4) is cylindrical and comprises inwardly 

projecting, hemispherical support points (5) distributed over 
the circumference.
