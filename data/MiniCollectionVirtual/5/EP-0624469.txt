<ABSTRACT>
A print head device is used in 
continuous ink jet printing. The device comprises a 

resonator means and ink supply body having a solid 
formed of high acoustic Q material. Transducer 

means are attached to the resonator means. The 
transducer means are energized at a desired drop 

frequency. Damping means (38) are provided for 
suppression of undesired interfering vibration modes 

of the resonator means and ink supply body, to 
achieve a desired mode. The damping means (38) are 

placed in regions having relatively high stress in 
the interfering modes and relatively low stress in 

the desired mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink jet
drop generators and, more particularly, to an
improved structure for an ink jet drop generator.In continuous ink jet printing, ink is
supplied under pressure to a manifold region that
distributes the ink to a plurality of orifices,
typically arranged in a linear array(s). The ink
discharges from the orifices in filaments which
break into droplet streams. The approach for
printing with these droplet streams is to
selectively charge and deflect certain drops from
their normal trajectories.In the field of ink jet printers, it is
desirable from the standpoint of throughput to
utilize long arrays of ink jets. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 4,999,647 discloses a drop generator for
use with a long array of holes such that the length
is larger than the height. A plurality of slots
were employed to insure uniform vibration amplitude
of the longitudinal mode (height direction) across
the orifice plate face. Co-pending, commonly
assigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
07/891,492, filed May 29, 1992,
defines an improved drop generator in
which the fluid cavity length is established to
suppress pressure waves in the fluid cavity. Such
pressure waves in the fluid can interfere with
stimulation produced by the resonator-induced motion
of the orifice plate.With longer array devices or higher
frequencies, it becomes more difficult to excite the
desired vibration mode without exciting other modes 
adversely affect stimulation uniformity. For example, in
the equation
An = Bn/[(fn 2 - f2) + c],
An is the vibration amplitude of mode n, Bn is a constant
depending on the mode shape, fn is the resonant frequency
of node n, f is the driving frequency, and c is a small
value related to attenuation. To drive the nth mode while
trying to avoid driving the n+1th mode, the resonator is
driven at a frequency of f = fn. The amplitude An would
reach its maximum value of Bn/c. The amplitude of An+1
would be Bn+1/((fn+1 2 - fn 2) + c). As the desired
frequency or the resonator length increase, the separation
between the resonant modes, fn+1 - fn, decreases. As the
mode separation, fn+1 - fn, decreases, the ratio of their
amplitudes An/An+1 decreases. It is therefore harder to
excite the mode n without also exciting the n+1 mode.Even with judicious design of the drop generator to
insure that the desired mode is uniform, the undesirable
excitation of an adjacent resonant mode can produce
unacceptable stimulation uniformity across the array.
Furthermore, the degree to which the undesirable modes
