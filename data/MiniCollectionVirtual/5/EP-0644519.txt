<ABSTRACT>
A system comprises mobile units and virtual 
beacons/radio beacons (VB). An arrangement determines 

whether a mobile unit passes an affected beacon. A unit 
(BLT) extracts a first position information produced by 

the system for the current virtual beacon. Elements are 
arranged to determine if the said passage exists or not 

in dependence on a comparison function with the second 
position information relating to the position of the 

mobile and extracted from an external position determining 
system (EPD).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement
for determining, in a system which includes, on the one
hand, mobile units, for example a road transport information
system (RTI), and, on the other hand, virtual
beacons (radio beacons), the passage of a respective
mobile unit past a respective beacon.From American Patent Specification 5,043,736, it
is already known to utilize a cellular locating system.
The system consists of a portable locating unit which can
be used both as mobile telephone and for global positioning.
The unit has a receiver for receiving signals from
a global positioning system (GPS) and circuits for
calculating the position. The position thus obtained is
then transmitted via a mobile telephone system to the
central unit. In the central unit, there is a possibility
for correlating the position obtained with a stored
digital map for placing the user on the actual location
on the map.In American Patent Specification US 4,701,760, a
method for positioning vehicles and for providing communication
between the vehicles and a central unit is
described. Coordinates of the vehicles are determined
with the aid of an omega network and corrected when
passing control beacons.In European Patent Application 242,099, a method
for locating a vehicle, for example when a car is stolen,
is shown. A unit in the vehicle calculates the position
of the vehicle with the aid of a GPS system. This position
is transmitted to a central monitoring station via
a mobile telephone system if a break-in is detected or if
a change of the position is detected.The publication "Integrated Land and Coastal
Navigation Using a Differential GPS receiving System, the 
Third International Conference On Beacle Navigation and
Information system, N Cheong, 1991, Volume 1, pages 380-386"
discloses an integrated navigation system based on
differential GPS. The system is intended for both sea and
land vehicles and utilizes the base stations in a
cellular mobile telephone system for transmitting the
DGPS signals to the user on land.The above references thus show different possibilities
for determining the position of a vehicle, for
example a mobile unit, with the aid of external positioning
systems together with a communications system which
can be of the mobile type.A beacon is a location where short-range data
transactions for RTI (Road Transport Informatics) can be
carried out. The range of a beacon is 10 - 500 metres
depending on the technology used. Beacon systems are not
continuous and do not operate with handover capability.
The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for determining, in a system comprising
mobile units (M), for example a road transport

information system (RTI), and virtual beacons (radio
beacons VB), the passage of a respective mobile unit past

a respective beacon, characterized in that said arrangement includes a unit (BLT)
which is arranged to extract a first position information (I1)

produced by the system for a current virtual beacon (VB),
and that said arrangement includes comparison-effecting elements (6), which are arranged to determine whether

there is a passage or not in dependence on a comparison
with a second position information (I2) relating to the

position of the mobile and extracted from an external
position determining system (EPD).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the external position determining system (EPI)

consists of a system known per se, for example the global
positioning system GPS, the differential global positioning

system DGPS, the said systems in combination with
dead reckoning, and so forth.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the unit (BLT) serves a part area (2, 3, 4

or 5) which is covered by the mobile system and thereby
specifies positions, produced by the mobile system, for

the virtual beacons (VB) in a respective part area, and
that the mobile system is- arranged with a master unit

(MBLT) which controls a number of part area units (BLT).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that a respective part area unit (PLT) in

table form specifies virtual beacons within the part area
(2, 3, 4 or 5) and that the table concerned is updated

with a real and/or virtual beacon address.
Arrangement according to claim 3, characterized in that the master unit (NBLT) is
provided with or has stored access telephone numbers and

positions of virtual beacons, whereby a simple changeability
is produced in that the virtual beacons of the

system can be moved, increased, shut down etc., which
changeability is intended also to occur preferably during 

operation of the system, and that said changes can be
downloaded in a respective part area unit (BLT).
Arrangement according to any of the preceding

claims, characterized in that a said comparison-effecting
element (6) is intended to effect a difference signal or

parameter (AUP) on comparison, and that a predetermined
value or predetermined magnitude of the difference signal

indicates whether a passage exists at the virtual beacon
concerned.
Arrangement according to Claim 6, characterized
in that a certain predetermined position difference is

also calculated and that all values of the signal or
parameter below the predetermined value or within a

current value range indicate a passage.
Arrangement according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that the allowed signal value or parameter

difference is arranged to be adjustable.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that when a passage of a current

beacon has been established, the mobile unit/vehicle
obtains data from the system, and that the mobile unit

reports the traffic situation on the distance just
travelled to the current beacon for enabling the beacon

system to update the traffic situation, in addition to
which an individual transaction or individual transactions

for a range of applications can be carried out.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that processor and display units

known per se can be used for both real and virtual beacon
access.
