<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fabric especially 
useful for ballistic protection wherein the fill fibers in 
the fabric are chosen to be tougher and to have higher 
elongation to break than the warp fibers in the fabric. Canadian Patent Number 1,034,842, issued July 18, 
1978 on the application of Weinberger, discloses a fabric 
useful for ballistics protection which has dissimilar 
fibers in the warp and weft directions. The apparent 
reason for the dissimilar fibers in that patent, however, 
was to achieve dissimilar patterns of corrugation on 
opposite fabric surfaces. The fibers are desired to be 
"spongy" in the weft and "relatively hard" in the warp, 
with no further indication as to the meaning of "spongy" 
and "relatively hard". It appears that the improvement in 
the fabric resides in the different corrugations on 
opposite sides of the fabric. European Patent Application 310,199, published 
April 5, 1989 on the application of Hoogenboom et al., 
discloses a ballistic fabric wherein the warp and fill 
yarns are made from different polymers and, moreover, the 
warp yarn is selected to exhibit a higher elongation to 
break than the fill yarn. The present invention provides a woven fabric of 
balanced ballistics properties comprising a warp of fibers 
with elongation to break greater than about 2.2% and as 
much as about 6.0% ; and a fill of 
fibers with elongation to break greater than that of the 
warp fibers. High tenacity fibers have long been used in 
weaving fabrics which exhibit good ballistics performance.  
 
Of course, there is a constant search for improvements in 
such fabrics; and this invention relates to such 
improvements. The fabrics of this invention exhibit 
ballistics performance which is improved over the 
ballistics performance of similar fabrics known before 
this invention. For the purpose of understanding this invention, 
"warp" means the yarns in a woven fabric that run 
lengthwise and parallel with the selvage and are 
interwoven with the fill yarns. By "fill" is meant the yarns in a woven fabric that 
run widthwise and from selvage to selvage and are 
interwoven with the warp yarns. It has been the belief that fibers which exhibit a 
high elongation to break exhibit improved ballistics 
protection performance for a given tenacity. In the 
present invention, in addition, it has been discovered 
that ballistics performance of a woven fabric can be 
improved by using fibers having a higher elongation to 
break in the fill (transverse) direction than in the warp 
(machine)
