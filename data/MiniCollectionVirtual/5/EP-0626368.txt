<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing pure, distilled isocyanates by reacting the corresponding amines with phosgene in a suitable solvent and multistage workup by distillation to provide pure isocyanates, pure solvent and a proportion of residue, this residue being continuously worked up. The workup is characterised in that the residue obtained from the distillation process, together with 2-50% by weight of high-boiling hydrocarbons, preferably bitumen, which are inert under the distillation conditions, is continuously fed to a heated product-agitating vacuum drier having a horizontal shaft, the proportion of isocyanates still present in the residue is continuously distilled off at temperatures of 160 to 280@C under pressures of 2 to 50 mbar and the remaining residue is continuously discharged as flowable non-dust forming granules, cooled if necessary and, if necessary after grinding, incinerated.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of pure, distilled
isocyanates by reaction of the corresponding amines

with phosgene in a suitable solvent and multistep
working up, by means of distillation, of the resulting

isocyanate solution into pure isocyanates, pure
solvent and a portion of residue, characterised in

that the residue obtained from the distillation
process is passed continuously together with 2 to

50 wt.% of high-boiling hydrocarbons, preferably
bitumen, which are inert under the distillation

conditions, to a heated vacuum dryer having a
horizontal shaft where the product is agitated, the

portion of isocyanates still present in the residue is
distilled off continuously at temperatures of from

160°C to 280°C and at pressures of from 2 to 50 mbar
and the remaining residue is discharged continuously

as flowing, dust-free granular material, is optionally
cooled and removed for combustion after optional

grinding.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the residue separated by the hydrocarbons is passed in

several split streams to the dryer.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that
part of the residue mixed with the hydrocarbons is

passed to the dryer and the remaining residue is
passed in one or more split streams to the dryer.
The use of a device comprising a continuously
operating, heated vacuum dryer having a horizontal

shaft where the product is agitated and several
product inlets distributed along the length of the 

dryer for the removal of the isocyanates from residues
from the distillation of isocyanates.
