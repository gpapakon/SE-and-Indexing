<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring elongated plastics profiles, in particular tubes. The device comprises a measuring (test) chamber (7), which is under a vacuum and/or filled with water and has an inlet and outlet which are sealed with respect to the plastics profile (10). At least one receptacle (16) which has a window (18) provided in its floor and pointing towards the measuring chamber (7) is provided in the housing (11) of the measuring chamber (7). Adjustably seated in this receptacle is an insert member (20) which has a measuring head (24), arranged removably therein, of an ultrasonic sensor. By adjusting the insert member, the measuring head (24) can be brought with its exposed transmitter and receiver side (24a) into a measuring position in front of the window (18). However, by being adjusted it can also be brought into a mounting position in which the window (18) is closed by the insert member (20), with the result that the measuring head (24) can be removed without impairing the relationships in the measuring chamber (7).

A device for the measuring of elongate plastics
profiles (10), more particularly tubes having a liquid-filled

measuring chamber (7) under negative pressure which
has an inlet and an outlet each sealable in relation to a

plastics profile and is equipped with at least one
ultrasonic sensor whose measuring head (24) has an exposed

transmitter and receiver side (24a) and which is disposed
in an insert member (20-23) releasably inserted in a

receptacle (15, 17) in the casing wall (11) of the
measuring chamber (7), characterised in that the receptacle

(16, 18) for the insert member (20-23) takes the shape of a
recess formed in the outside of the casing wall (11) and

having a window (18) which points towards the interior of
the measuring chamber (7) and with which in the measuring

position of the insert member (20-23) the exposed
transmitter and receiver side (24a) of the measuring head

(24) can be brought into registration, so that the coupling
liquid in the measuring chamber (7) arrives as far as the

exposed transmitter and receiver side (24a), said window
being closed by the insert member (20-23) following an

adjustment thereof into an assembly position.
A device according to Claim 1 characterised in that
the receptacle (16, 17) takes the shape of a blind bore and

the insert member (20-23) can be adjusted after the fashion
of a revolver cartridge cylinder by rotation into the

measuring and assembly position.
A device according to Claims 1 or 2 characterised in
that the water-filled measuring chamber (7) is disposed 

between a vacuum cooling chamber (4) with calibration
sleeve (5) and a vacuum cooling chamber (8) and is

connected sealing-tight to said chambers (4, 8), the
measuring chamber (7) having an overflow (15) discharging

into one (4) of the cooling chambers.
