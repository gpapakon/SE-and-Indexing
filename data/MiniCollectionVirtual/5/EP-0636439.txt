<ABSTRACT>
A tundish baffle (40) having a plurality of 
fluted openings (56-100) is provided. The fluted 

openings (56-100) interrupt and remove inclusions from 
molten metal passing through the baffle (40), using a 

plurality of obstructive peaks (104) and valleys (102) 
located at the perimeters of the openings (56-100). 

The fluted openings (56-100) also include central 
portions which are not obstructed by the flutes, 

through which molten metal can flow in a regular 
fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to baffles for
controlling the flow of fluids in vessels. More
specifically, the invention is directed to baffles for
controlling the flow of molten metal, and for helping
to purify the molten metal, in metallurgical vessels
such as tundish vessels used in the iron and steel
industry.During the continuous casting of steel, for
example, molten metal is transferred from large ladles
into intermediate pouring vessels called tundishes.
From these tundishes, the molten metal is poured into
ingots, or other molds, to cast the molten metal.While in the tundishes, impurities (called
"inclusions") in the molten metal float to the top,
forming a "slag" layer of impurities, and the pure,
substantially "inclusion-free" metal exits from the
bottom. Depending on the size of the tundish, and the
flow rate of molten metal, the molten metal may not
always have enough residence time in the tundish to
permit the impurities to float to the top. To increase
the residence time in tundishes, and regulate the flow
of molten metal, baffles having flow control openings
have been developed. One such baffle is disclosed in
U.S. Patent 4,667,939, issued to Luyckx.Impurities entrained in the molten metal may 
affect the final cast product. Processing of the metal
may be thereby hampered, or the finished product may be
less pure, less structurally sound or have poor
finishing quality. These impurities originate from
several sources. For example, impurities may include
metallic impurities such as alkaline and/or alkaline
earth metals, dissolved entrained gases and occluded
tundish surface oxide films which have broken up in the
molten metal. In addition, inclusions may originate
from non-metallic sources such as carbides or borides
and eroded furnace and trough refractories. Effective
removal of these impurities, with the aid of apertured
baffles and other flow control devices, as appropriate,
is an important aspect of molten metal processing.As described in the above-referenced U.S.
Patent 4,667,939, tundish baffle openings or apertures
are typically round. The apertures may be formed
straight through the tundish baffle in a horizontal
orientation, or may be slanted at an angle to direct
the molten metal (and inclusions) somewhat upward.
Also, the apertures may be cylindrical or frustoconical
(i.e. tapered).One of the problems existing in prior art
apertured tundish baffles is that non-metallic
inclusions tend to collect or "cake" around the outer
circumferences of the round apertures. As this occurs,
the
