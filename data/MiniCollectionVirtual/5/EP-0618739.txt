<ABSTRACT>
In order to achieve a digital video camera 
apparatus which decreases the number of components and 

facilitates connection with a digital VTR, a luminance 
signal Y and a color signal C input form external input 

terminals (110, 118) are converted into digital signals 
by A/D converters (136, 138) by sampling these signals 

respectively at the sampling frequency of a digital 
recording/reproduction device (113) and a frequency 

four times the subcarrier frequency, the digital 
signals are selected by selectors (135, 137) together 

with signals Y and C from a digital signal processing 
circuit (106), and the selected signals are supplied to 

the digital signal recording/reproduction device (113). 
Color-difference signals are supplied after their 

frequency is converted into the sampling frequency of 
the digital signal recording/reproduction device (113) 

by frequency converters (139a, 139b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal recording device and to a digital video camera comprising such a signal recording device.Figs. 1A and 1B show a conventional video camera
apparatus for A/D-converting an analog signal output
from a solid-state image pickup element, and performing
signal processing in a digital form. Referring to
Figs. 1A and 1B, a video signal obtained via a lens
element 1, a solid-state image pickup device 2, a
correlation double sampling circuit 3, and a gain
adjustment circuit 4 is sampled by an A/D converter 5
to be converted into a digital signal.The sampled digital signal is supplied to a
digital signal processing circuit 6. The digital
signal processing circuit 6 generates a digital
luminance signal and digital color-difference signals
from the input digital signal. The digital luminance
signal generated by the digital signal processing
circuit 6 is converted into a band-limited analog 
luminance signal via a D/A converter 12 and a low-pass
filter 13.The digital color-difference signals are converted
into band-limited analog color-difference signals via
D/A converters 35 and 36 and low-pass filters 37 and
38. Furthermore, the analog color-difference signals
are supplied to a modulation circuit 39 to be converted
into an analog chrominance signal. The analog
chrominance signal is supplied to a digital signal
recording device 21 together with the analog luminance
signal. The processing so far is executed at the
sampling frequency of the image pickup element.When YC-separated input signals are externally
input as a video signal, these signals are respectively
input to switch circuits 8 and 9. When a composite
video signal VIDEO is input, the signal VIDEO is
separated into luminance and chrominance signals by a
luminance/chrominance separation circuit 7, and the
separated signals are input to the switch circuits 8
and 9. One of these YC-separated input signals and the
composite video signal is selected by the switch
circuits 8 and 9.The analog luminance and color-difference signals
from a camera and externally input analog luminance and
color-difference signals are selected by switch
circuits 14 and 15. The frequency band of the analog
luminance signal is limited by a low-pass filter 17. 
The band-limited analog luminance signal is supplied to
an A/D converter 18 to be converted into a digital
luminance signal.The analog chrominance signal is converted into
analog color-difference signals by a demodulation
device 40, and the analog color-difference signals are
then
