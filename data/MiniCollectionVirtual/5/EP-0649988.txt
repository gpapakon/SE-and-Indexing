<ABSTRACT>
When a solenoid proportional valve (91A) of a 
direction control valve (8A) is left open due to failure 

and an operator makes a reverse lever operation for 
operating an operation lever (4A) in an x₂ direction, a 

low level signal is outputted from an operation position 
sensor (30A₂) and a high level signal is outputted from 

operation position sensors (30A₁, 30B₁, 30B₂). Since 
the output of an AND circuit (6b₂) becomes a low level 

signal and the output of an AND circuit (6b₁) becomes 
a high level signal, a change-over signal is outputted 

from an amplification circuit (6h) to a solenoid change-over 
valve (121), so that the solenoid change-over valve 

(121) is switched to a right side position in the figure to 
allow a pilot line (51) to keep communicating with a tank 

(97). The change-over signal is not outputted from the 
amplification circuit (6h) to a solenoid change-over valve 

(122), and the solenoid change-over valve (122) is kept 
at a left side position in the figure. Accordingly, the pilot 

line (52) keeps communicating with a pilot pump (96). 
At this time, a driving signal from a metering calculation 

portion (6a) is inputted to a solenoid proportional valve 
(92A) of a direction control valve and the solenoid 

proportional valve (92A) is excited, so that a secondary 
pilot pressure is given from the solenoid proportional 

valve (92A) to a pilot operation portion (22A) of the 
direction control valve (8A). Because a primary pilot 

pressure to the solenoid proportional valve (91A) is 
reduced by the solenoid change-over valve (121) to the 

tank pressure, the direction control valve (8A), that has 
existed at the left side position in the figure, is switched 

to the left and can be easily returned to a neutral position.
