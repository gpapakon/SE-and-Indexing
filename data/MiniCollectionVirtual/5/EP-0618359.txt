<ABSTRACT>
An ignition system for internal combustion engines with a magnet generator which, in dependence on the rotational position of the machine, induces an alternating charge voltage for an energy storing element which in order to trigger ignition is discharged by an ignition switch which is actuated synchronously with the alternating voltage, with a timer module which responds to the alternating voltage with the production of an actuation inhibit signal for the ignition switch for the duration of a first time interval which corresponds to an upper rotational speed limit for the internal combustion engine, the timer module responding to the alternating voltage with the production of a separate delay signal for the delayed actuation of the ignition switch for the duration of a second longer time interval which corresponds to a lower rotational speed limit, preferably to the idling rotational speed of the machine.
