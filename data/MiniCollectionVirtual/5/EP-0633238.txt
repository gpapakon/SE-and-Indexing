<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of U. S. 
Patent Application Serial No. 07/369,895, filed June 
22, 1989. The present invention relates to improved 
asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation of α-arylpropenoic 
acids to yield the corresponding α-arylpropionic acid 
in high enantiomeric excess. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to asymmetric catalytic 
hydrogenation of α-arylpropenoic acids utilizing 
asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts under conditions of 
low temperature and, optionally, high pressure. The 
improved asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation process of 
the present invention is particularly suited for use 
in the synthesis of naproxen. Accordingly, the 
present invention more particularly relates to a novel 
synthetic route for preparing 2-(6'-methoxy-2'-naphthyl) 
propionic acid (naproxen) and to intermediates 
prepared and utilized in such synthetic route. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal compound having 
anti-inflammatory, nonnarcotic analgesic and antipyretic 
activities. It belongs to a group of compounds, 
generally classified as arylpropionic acids or 
arylalkanoic acids, which group includes naproxen, 
ibuprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, suprofen, 
flurbiprofen, benoxaprofen, pirprofen and carprofen. 
Each of the compounds of this group are related in 
that they are propionic acid derivatives. Many synthetic routes for producing 
arylpropionic acids and, in particular, naproxen have 
been proposed. The first synthetic routes produced a 
mixture of optical isomers or enantiomorphs. Thus,  
 
such routes required resolution of the mixture to 
obtain the more active isomer, such as with cinchonidine 
or glucamine. These resolution procedures, 
however, require numerous recrystallizations and are, 
therefore, not commercially attractive. More recently, attempts have been made for 
preparing the pharmaceutically useful optical isomer 
in excess of the physiologically inactive isomer so 
that the resolution procedure could be simplified. 
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,542,237 discloses a 
process for preparing α-arylpropionic acids and, in 
particular, a process for preparing naproxen, which 
involves a noncatalytic rearrangement of a ketal or 
thioketal of 2-hydroxy-1-(6'-methoxy-2'-naphthyl)propan-l-one 
by activating the α-hydroxy moiety with 
an esterifying agent to form the corresponding alkyl 
aryl ketal or thioketal ester substrate. Concomitant 
or sequential hydrolysis of the ester produces the 
corresponding arylpropionic acid, 2-(6'-methoxy-2' 
naphthyl)propionic acid. See also
