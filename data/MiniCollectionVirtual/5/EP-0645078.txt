<ABSTRACT>
An improved bag 20 for the cultivation of mushroom spawn has front and 
back walls 22, 24 having a plurality of openings 26 disposed therethrough, a top 28 

and a bottom 30, and left and right sides 32, 34. A plurality of gas permeable 
sealing strips 36, 38 are sealed to the walls 22, 24 and cover each of the openings 26. 

The openings 26 are arrayed in a pair of parallel rows 42, 44 proximate respectively 
the top 28 and the bottom 30 of the bag 20 so as to provide more uniform 

breathability of the mushroom spawn through the gas permeable sealing strips 36, 38, 
the openings 26 and the gas permeable sealing strips 36, 38 being constructed and 

arranged so as to reduce dry spots in the mushroom spawn and improve spawn yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to plastic bags and more particularly
to a novel air permeable bag suitable for use in the cultivation of mushroom spawn.It has been customary in the past to produce mushroom in plastic bags.
This is accomplished by pasteurising a substrate, inoculating the substrate with
mushroom spawn seeds, transferring the mixture into plastic bags and after a suitable
method of incubation, collecting the mushrooms at maturity. The inoculation is
performed by mixing the substrate and the fungus seeds in the open air. This
operation also requires for the pasteurisation room to remain open for several hours.
Moreover, since it is highly desirable to prevent contamination of the mushroom from
contact with microbes in the air, the transfer of inoculated, pasteurised substrate from
one container to plastic bags involves some difficulty.US Patent No. 2851821 discloses mushroom spawn grown in a plastic bag.
The bag is closed by turning the ends of the bag and forming a chimney, and it is
sealed by placing a wad of cotton or the like in the chimney thus formed. In another
embodiment, a tube is inserted in the top of the bag and the bag gathered around the
tube of the string, A filter plug is then placed in the tube.Another method is described in US Patent No. 4027427 wherein the spawn
is grown in a plastic bag provided with a temporary filter cover. This bag is provided 
with a removal closure mechanism for filling the bag and maintaining sterility during
the processing steps.US Patent No. 4977702 discloses a bag for the production of eatable
mushrooms which is provided with a number of gas exchange surfaces or membranes
which are impervious to outside micro organisms, thereby avoiding contamination of
the nutrient substrate by outside micro organisms. Inoculation can be performed by
injection of the inoculum in suspension trough the plastic bag. The gas exchange
membranes of the bag may be made of Dupont Tyvek ® spun bonded polyolefin. US
Patent No. 4311477 teaches a bag for cultivating mushrooms constructed, at least in
part, from a micro-porous film having gas permeability, but which does not pass
bacteria and infectious microbes.Although it has been found that the above-listed bags are suitable for the
production of mushroom spawn, it has also been found that the growth of the spawn
is hindered within the bags by the lack of adequate airflow and direction of the
airflow at an appropriate volume to the substrate within the bags.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention

<CLAIMS>
A bag for cultivation of mushroom spawn, said bag comprising a front wall
(22) having a plurality of openings (26) disposed therethrough, a back wall (24), a

top (28) and a bottom (30) and left and right sides (32,34) and a plurality of gas
permeable sealing strips (36,38) sealed to said front wall (22) and covering each of

said openings, characterised in that said openings (26) are arrayed in a pair of parallel
rows (42,44) proximate respectively said top (28) and bottom (30) of said bag (20),

and that said sealing strips cover said rows (42,44), each sealing strip (36,38) having
a length sufficient to cover all of the openings (26) in the row (42 or 44) that it covers

and a width less than the distance between said top (28) and bottom (30) of said bag
(20), said openings (26) and said sealing strips (36,38) being constructed and arranged

so as to reduce dry spots in said mushroom spawn and improve spawn yield.
A bag according to claim 1, wherein said openings (26) are of substantially
equal size, laterally arrayed trough said front wall (22) of said bag (20) inwardly of

said left and right sides (32,34), said openings (26) further comprising an upper row
(42) and a lower row (44) spaced apart from said upper row (42), said upper row (42)

being parallel to said top (28) of said bag and said lower row (44) being parallel to
said bottom (30) of said bag whereby air is permitted to circulate more freely trough

said bag.
A bag according to claim 2, wherein said upper row (42) of openings (26)
is spaced approximately 15 cms (six inches) from said top (28) of said bag and one 

of said strips (36,38) has a top edge spaced approximately 14 cms (five and one half
inches) from said top (28) of said bag.
A bag according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said lower row (44) of openings
(26) is spaced approximately 12.5 cms (five inches) from said bottom (30) of said bag

and one of said strips (36, 38) is spaced approximately 11.4 cms (four and one half
inches) from said bottom (30) of said bag.
