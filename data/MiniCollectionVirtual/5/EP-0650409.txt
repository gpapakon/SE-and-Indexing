Method for regulating the individual layer
thicknesses (dA, dB, dC, dD) of a plurality of layers

(A, B, C, D) of a multi-layer plastics sheet (100)
which is to be produced by coextrusion, with at least

two plastics melt streams being melted separately in
one or several extruders and the individual melt

streams being brought together in an adapter and placed
one on top of the other in layers to form a web, and

the multi-layer web formed in this way being supplied
to a wide slit tool (2) for shaping the multi-layer

plastics sheet (100), and with there being provided
means for controlling the flow of the individual melt

streams directly before said melt streams are brought
together in the adapter by altering the flow cross-sections

in order to influence both the thickness
distribution of the layer which is formed by each melt

stream and placed on the web during the bringing
together and also by the rate of flow, characterised in

that the layer thicknesses (dA, dB, dC, dD) of the
individual layers (A, B, C, D) of the multi-layer web,

which layers correspond to the various melt streams,
are established before the exit from the wide slit tool

(2), and the measurement data obtained are evaluated
and digitalised, and the measurement signals

accordingly obtained are compared with likewise
digitalised nominal value entries for the thicknesses

of the individual layers (A, B, C, D), and in the case
of deviations of the nominal/actual-value comparison,

the result is used to alter the flow cross-sections
(63, 73, 83) for the individual melt streams (B, C, D)

directly before the said melt streams are brought
together to form a web.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the layer thicknesses of the layers, which are

formed by the various melt streams and brought together 
in a web, i.e. are placed one on top of the other, are

established by means of ultrasound pulses according to
the pulse echo principle, from the delay time

differences.
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the amplitude differences or

frequency differences of the echo signals which are
received are additionally evaluated.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that ultrasonic probes for emitting

ultrasound pulses and receiving the echo pulses
reflected by the object or the layers are used to

detect the layer thickness of the individual layers (A,
B, C, D).
Method according to claim 4, characterised in
that the ultrasonic probes are brought directly into

contact with the surface of the outermost layer of the
web to be measured, in particular ending snug with the

wall of the flow channel for the web in the adapter or
wide slit tool.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that a thickness profile is

established at right angles to the flow direction (P)
for each layer (A, B, C, D) by means of several

measurement points, which are distributed over the
width of the web.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the layer thicknesses of the

layers of the multi-layer web are established directly
after the uniting with the last of the layers, while

still inside the adapter region, before the web enters
into the wide slit tool.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the layer thicknesses of the

layers of the multi-layer web are established directly
after entry of the web into the wide slit tool. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the layer thicknesses of the

layers of the multi-layer web are established in the
region of the forward zone of the wide slit tool.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the layer thicknesses of the

layers of the multi-layer web are established in the
region of the nozzle-lip zone of the wide slit tool
Method according to one of the claims 2 to
10, characterised in that the ultrasonic probe is

provided with a control device for controlling the
ultrasound pulses which are to be emitted and a signal

processing unit for detecting and evaluating the echo
pulses reflected by the object, and the ultrasound

pulses which are emitted are incident upon at least two
reflecting surfaces which are at different distances

from the emission location, and the signal processing
unit is capable of comparing, for an ultrasound pulse

which has been emitted, the magnitudes of at least two
associated echo pulses which originate from reflecting

surfaces at different distances from the emission
location, and as a function of the comparison generates

a measurement signal, which is a measure of the
thickness of the layer detected in each case, and the

measurement signal obtained in this way is compared, in
digitalised form, with digitalised nominal entries in a

computer, and in the case of deviations of the
nominal/actual-value, the result is used to alter the

flow cross-sections (63, 73, 83) in partial regions or
the whole of the melt streams in the adapter and to

alter the throughput of the individual extruders for
the melt streams of the individual layers (A, B, C).
