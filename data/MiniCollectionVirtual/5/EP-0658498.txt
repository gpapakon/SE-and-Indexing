<ABSTRACT>
In an accumulation conveyor chain (F) which is composed of a link chain (H) having alternating inner and outer plates (1, 2) which are coupled via hollow or solid joint pins (5, 6) and in which the bushes (3, 4) are fixed in the inner plates (2) and the joint pins (5, 6) passing rotatably through the bushes (3, 4) are fixed in the outer plates (1), and in which large-diameter conveying rollers (R) are mounted on bushes (4) predetermined along the chain length and smaller running rollers (L) are mounted on both sides on joint pins (6) extended outwards beyond their bushes, the joint pins (5) in bushes (3) free of conveying rollers (R) are made non-extended and free of running rollers (L). The conveying chain consists of few parts, can shift aside during operation and can be used universally with chain wheels for normal-link chains or for long-link chains.

<CLAIMS>
An accumulation conveyor chain (F) comprising a link chain 
(4) with alternating inner and outer link plates (1, 2, 2') 

coupled via hollow or solid hinge bolts (5, 6) in which the 
sleeves (3, 4) are fixed in the inner link plates and the hinge 

bolts rotatably traversing the sleeves are fixed in the outer 
link plates, large-diameter conveyor rollers (R) being mounted 

on sleeves (4) predetermined along the chain length and smaller 
rollers (L) being mounted at both sides on hinge bolts (6) 

extended outwardly beyond their sleeves, 
characterized in
 that 
the hinge bolts (5) are located in sleeves (3) free from 

conveyor rollers (R) in unextended fashion and free from 
rollers (L). 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to claim 1, 

characterized in
 that in each case an inner link plate or a 
pair of inner link plates (2, 2') is disposed in the 

longitudinal center of the two sleeves (3, 4) adjacent in the 
longitudinal direction of the chain at a distance from the 

outer link plates (1) and that a conveyor roller (R) is 
disposed between the inner link plate or the pair of inner link 

plates (2, 2') and the outer link plate (1) on at least one 
outer side of the inner link plate or the pair of inner link 

plates (2, 2'). 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to at least one 
of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that one conveyor roller (R) 
each is provided at both sides of the inner link plate or the  

 
pair of inner link plates (2, 2') and that, preferably in a 

hollow bolt link chain (H) with normal link pitch, two conveyor 
rollers (R) and two rollers (L) are disposed at each second 

hinge bolt (6). 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to claim 2, 

characterized in
 that the contour of the inner link plate or 
the pair of inner link plates (2, 2') overlaps the contour of 

the conveyor roller (R) on the sleeve (4) on the next following 
inner link plate or pair of link plates (2, 2'). 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to at least one 
of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that the ends (9) of the 
shorter hinge bolts (5) are disposed directly at the outer 

sides (10) of the outer link plates (1) and are preferably 
located whtin the chain wheel engagement areas (11) and 

possibly the chain guide engagement areas (11) of the rollers 
(L). 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to at least one 
of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that, for the pull-off 
protection of each roller (L), the free end of the longer hinge 

bolt (6) is formed directly at the front side (8) of the roller 
(L) in thickened fashion by means of cold forming, e.g. 

upsetting, riveting, or the like. 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to claim 6, 

characterized in
 that the free end (7) is cold formed by means 
of upsetting in at least two diameter planes (12) being 

staggered with respect to each other about the axis of the 
hinge bolt, e.g. multiple roof riveting.  

 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to claims 1 to 7, 

characterized in
 that liners or sleeves of materials with self-lubricating 
properties, e.g. plastics, ceramics or sintered 

material, are provided between the components of the 
accumulation conveyor chain (S), which are movable relative to 

each other. 
An accumulation conveyor chain according to claim 2, 

characterized in
 that the inner link plate or the pair of 
innner link plates (2') with the two sleeves (3', 4') is a one-partite 

shaped part manufactured by pressing, extruding, 
forging, swaging, sintering and the like.
