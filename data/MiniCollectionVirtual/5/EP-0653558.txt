<ABSTRACT>
The process concerns an engine which has at least one cylinder (5) and is provided with a forced-induction set comprising a turbine (8) and a compressor (2). During the compression stroke, the cylinder is supplied by the forced-induction set with fresh air, into which fuel is injected towards the end of the compression stroke. Of the quantity of exhaust gas formed in the cylinder during each combustion process, an amount between at least 5 and at most 40 per cent by weight, preferably no more than 20 per cent by weight, is retained in the cylinder (5). This retained quantity of exhaust gas mixes with the fresh air flowing in during the next compression stroke and the oxygen concentration in the cylinder is thereby reduced.

A process for reducing the nitrous oxide content in the
exhaust gas of a two-stroke large Diesel engine comprising at

least one cylinder (5), which is provided with a
supercharging group consisting of a turbine (8) and

compressor (2), with which during the compression stroke the
cylinder is charged with fresh air by the supercharging

group, into which fuel is injected towards the end of the
compression stroke,
characterised in that
 from the quantity of exhaust gas
produced in the cylinder (5) during a combustion operation,

an amount lying between at least 5 and at most 40 percent by
weight, preferably at most 20 percent by weight, is retained

in the cylinder (5),

in that this retained amount of exhaust gas forms a mixture
with the fresh air flowing in during the next compression

stroke,
and in that
 during at least one part of each compression
stroke water is injected into the fresh air/exhaust air

mixture in the cylinder.
A process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the retention of the quantity of
exhaust gas occurs by reducing the charging of the cylinder

(5) with fresh air. 
A process according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the reduction of the fresh air charging
occurs by conveying a partial quantity of the exhaust gas

leaving the cylinder (5) past the turbine (8).
A process according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the energy of the partial quantity of
the exhaust gas conveyed past is utilised in an active

turbine (10).
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 water is also injected into the fresh
air/exha
ust gas mixture in the cylinder (5) during the
combustion operation.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the air compressed in the compressor
(2) is cooled before entering the cylinder (5).
A two-stroke large Diesel engine for performing the process
according to one of Claims 1 to 6.
