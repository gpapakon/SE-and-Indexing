<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhanced sterilization with improved material compatibility. The
following enhancements have been made. First, repeated venting , evacuation, and plasma

treatments can be performed in the pre-plasma stage. Second, a lower power level can be
used in the post-plasma stage than in the pre-plasma stage. Third, after the post-plasma-stage,

the chamber can be held at atmospheric pressure or sub-atmospheric pressure for a
period of time after venting, before re-evacuating the chamber, rather than evacuating after

the chamber is vented to atmospheric pressure or sub-atmospheric pressure. Any of the three
enhancements may be used separately, and it is not necessary to practice all three

enhancements to obtain at least some of the benefits of enhanced sterilization with improved
material compatibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of enhancing sterilization with a sterilant vapor and
plasma with improved material compatibility.Some new commercial systems for sterilizing medical instruments and the like utilize
low-temperature reactive gas plasma to achieve rapid, low-temperature, low-moisture
sterilization of medical items. Low-temperature gas plasma is sometimes described as a reactive
cloud which may contain ions, electrons, and/or neutral atomic particles. This state of matter
can be produced through the action of electric or magnetic fields, or through other external
forces such as high-energy particle flux. In general, an electric field can be in any frequency
range (an example of a naturally occurring plasma is the aurora borealis or the northern lights).
One commercial embodiment of plasma sterilization is the STERRAD (Trade Mark) Sterilization Process, as
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,643,876.The STERRAD Sterilization Process is performed in the following manner. The items
to be sterilized are placed in the sterilization chamber, the chamber is closed, and a vacuum is
drawn. An aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is injected and vaporized into the chamber so
that it surrounds the items to be sterilized. After reduction of the pressure in the sterilization
chamber, a low-temperature gas plasma is initiated by applying radio frequency energy to create
an electrical field. In the plasma, the hydrogen peroxide vapor is dissociated into reactive
species that collide/react with and kill microorganisms. After the activated components react
with the organisms or with each other, they lose their high energy and recombine to form
oxygen, water, and other nontoxic byproducts. The plasma is maintained for a sufficient time to
achieve sterilization and remove residuals. At the completion of the process, the RF energy is
turned off, the vacuum is released, and the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by the
introduction of High Efficiency Particulate -Filtered Air (HEPA).The above-described sterilization system can safely process medical items currently
sterilized by ethylene oxide and steam, with the exception of linens and other cellulosic 
materials, powders, and liquids. Sterilized items are ready to be used in a little over an hour
after starting the sterilizer. The process requires no aeration, and there are no toxic residues or
emissions. Preparation of instruments for sterilization is similar to current practices: cleaning
the instruments, reassembly, and wrapping. The system
