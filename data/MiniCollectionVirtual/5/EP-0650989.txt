<ABSTRACT>
A novel polyisocyanate which is liquid and room temperature 
stable and has an isocyanate group content of from 10 to 30% by weight 

is prepared by reacting: 

a) an isocyanate mixture of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 
2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and an amount of an 

isocyanate having an isocyanate functionality of more than 
2, selected from homologs of diphenylmethane diisocyanate 

having a functionality of at least 3 and modified 
diphenylmethane diisocyanates, such that the total 

isocyanate mixture a) has an average isocyanate 
functionality of from 2.02 to 2.50, and 
b) a polyol mixture comprising 

1) one or more diols having molecular weights of from 
1000 to 5000,

 
and 
2) one or more triols having molecular weights of from 
1000 to 6000, 


 
wherein the weight ratio of diol to triol is from 10:1 to 1:10. 
When used in a RIM process, parts are produced which 
have excellent low temperature impact properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
Diisocyanates which are liquid at room temperature have
numerous advantages over solid diisocyanates. The most commercially
important diisocyanates which are solid at room temperature are 4,4'-diphenyl-methane
diisocyanate and 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate.
Numerous patents have issued relating to the liquification of diphenyl-methane
diisocyanates ("MDI").One common route to liquification of MDI is through carbodiimidization.
Typical of this process are the processes described in U.S.
Patents 3,152,162, 3,384,643, 3,449,256, 3,640,966, 3,641,093,
3,701,796, 4,014,935, 4,088,665, 4,154,752, and 4,177,205.Other less common techniques include reaction with N,N-di-(2-hydroxypropyl)aniline
(U.S. Patent 3,394,165) and heating with N,N'-disubstituted
thioureas (U.S. 3,674,828).The most common technique used to liquify MDI is through
reaction with various hydroxyl functional materials. Thus, the prior art has
described several types of liquid isocyanates:
1) reaction products of MDI with poly-1,2-propylene ether
glycols having molecular weights of from 134 to 700 (U.S.
3,644,457);2) reaction products of MDI with a mixture of alkylene glycols
containing at least three carbon atoms (U.S. 3,883,571 and
4,229,347);3) mixtures of i) 30 to 80% by weight MDI, ii) 5 to 25% by
weight MDI uretonimine-containing derivatives, iii) 20 to 
50% by weight reaction products of MDI with diols or
mixtures of diols having molecular weights of less than 175,
and iv) 0 to 10% by weight polymethlyene poly(phenylisocyanates)
(U.S. 4,031,026);4) reaction products of polyoxyethylene glycols of molecular
weight of from 200 to 600 and polymethylene poly(phenylisocyanates)
containing from 65 to 85% by weight of MDI,
with the balance being higher homologues (U.S. 4,055,548);5) reaction products of MDI with polyols having molecular
weights of from 240 to 1500 and functionalities of from 2.7
to 3.3 (U.S. 4,102,833);6) reaction products of MDI (of various 2,4'-isomer contents)
with propylene glycol or poly-1,2-propylene ether glycols
(U.S. 4,118,411) or with polyoxyethylene glycols (U.S.
4,115,429);7) mixtures of i) 50 to 90% by weight reaction products of MDI
and blends of 50 to 100% by weight of polyoxypropylene
diols or triols having equivalent weights of from 750 to 3000
and 0 to 50% by weight polyoxyethylene diols or triols
having equivalent weights of from 750 to 3000, and ii) 10 to
50% by weight of polymethylene poly(phenyl isocyanate)
containing 30 to 65% of diphenylmethane diisocyanate
(U.S. 4,261,8520;8) mixtures of i) reaction
