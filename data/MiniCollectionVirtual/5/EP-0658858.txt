<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the hardware of the graphics computer in 
size and reduce the cost of the hardware by uniting the 

frame buffer and the main memory into one to process 
graphics data in the CPU. The frame buffer is 

arranged in the main memory, and a DMAC used to read 
pixel data from the frame buffer for display, a display 

used to receive the pixel data and display it on a 
display device such as an LCD, etc., and memories used to 

store the procedure used by the CPU to draw the pixel 
data in the said frame buffer are provided for the said 

graphics computer. Especially, the said memories are 
formed so that the single function procedure and the 

multifunction procedure can be selected to suit the 
drawing object in them. In addition, the single function 

procedure includes the line drawing procedure that uses 
data tables and the multivalue expansion procedure that 

uses a pattern table and a mask table. Since the frame 
buffer and the main memory are united into one, the CPU 

has come to process graphics data. Thus, the graphics 
computer hardware has been reduced in size and the cost 

of the hardware has been reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to graphics computers that
process images to draw graphics data such as characters
and graphic elements, and image data processing systems
or graphics computers that use such an image processor.
Especially, this invention is related to an image data
processing system that expands and processes binary data
of characters, symbols, etc. in a low-price and compact
graphics computer, as well as to the memory configuration
and control method to shorten the drawing time.The graphics computer that stores character codes
and graphic elements and draws, displays, or prints out
graphics data on the basis of them uses frame buffers to
store the said data corresponding to the pixels to be
displayed on screen (hereafter, to be referred to as
pixel data).When drawing graphics data, drawing processings and
display processings are needed. The drawing processing
includes computing of pixel positions and pixel data
itself from character codes and graphic elements and
writing the pixel data in the frame buffer according to
the pixel positions. The display processing includes
repetitive and sequential reading of pixel data from the
frame buffer corresponding to the pixels displayed on the
screen synchronously with the raster scanning in the 
display device to display stable images on the screen.In this section, the conventional technology related
to display data will be explained first. In order to
reduce the price of a graphics computer, a well-known
method is adopting a configuration in which the frame
buffer is arranged in the large capacity main memory.
Such the embodiment is disclosed in the graphics
processing system described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No.84192/1992, and by the display architecture designed
by Robert P. Colwell and described in "IEEE 1st
International Conference on Computer Workstation",
(pp.30-37) (Nov., 1985), which is a scientific journal
published in the United States. In those devices, a high
access mode for DRAM, etc. used as a memory is used for
display, reducing the display processing load. In other
words, the horizontal direction of the frame buffer is
aligned to the direction of the column addresses in the
DRAM, etc.When drawing pixel data, however, accesses to
addresses of different rows are often accessed in the
frame buffer even for continuous pixels in the
2-dimensional coordinate system. For example, when
drawing a line, which is almost vertical, those addresses
are separated from each other as much as the width of the
frame buffer horizontal memory even

<CLAIMS>
A microcomputer (001) provided with:

a CPU (010) that computes data to be displayed on a
raster scanning type display unit, first address bus

(071) connected to memories (002) used to store said
data, a second address bus (171) connected to said CPU

and used to specify the destination of the said data,
registers (151, 1570, 1571, 1573) used to store address

conversion data (MXC, TA, YS, XS) set by said CPU and an
address converter (158) that converts addresses from said

second address bus and outputs them to said first address
bus;

   
characterised in that
: said address converter (158)
is provided with first information (TA) that specifies an

area in the said memory to which to convert addresses
according to the address conversion information stored in

said registers;

   said address converter (158) converts addresses
according to said first information (TA), when addresses

are generated on the second address bus (171).
The microcomputer (001) described in Claim 1,

   wherein said address converter (158),
is further provided with second information (YS) used to

distinguish the second field (C) of the YS bit from the 
third field (D) and third information (XS) used to obtain

the first field (E) of the XS bit from the lower part of
the address according to the address conversion

information stored in said registers; and said address
converter exchanges said second and said third fields in

order to convert addresses.
The microcomputer described in Claim 2, wherein said

   address converter exchanges
the second and third fields when an address is generated

on said second address bus according to said first
information.
