<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tricyclic 
heterocyclyl compounds which have excellent activity in 
the inhibition of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase. Atherosclerosis is an important cause of ischemic 
cardiac insufficiency such as angina, myocardial 
infarction and the like. It has been considered that a 
major cause of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of 
cholesterol esters by foam cells which are present under 
the endodermis cell layer of blood vessels. Inhibitors of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 
(hereinafter referred as ACAT) inhibit the synthesis of 
cholesterol esters in the foam cells and they diminish the 
accumulation of cholesterol esters, thereby inhibiting the 
formation and development of atherosclerosis caused by the 
accumulation of cholesterol esters. It has also been established that atherosclerosis is 
linked with hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterols in food 
are absorbed as free cholesterol in the intestinal mucosal 
cell tract, esterified by ACAT and then enter the blood. 
Therefore, an inhibtor of ACAT will also prevent a rise in 
the cholesterol concentration in the blood by inhibiting 
the absorption of food cholesterol into the blood. For this reason, compounds which are active in the  
 
inhibition of ACAT are useful for the treatment and 
prophylaxis of atherosclerosis. Tricyclic heterocyclyl compounds which inhibit ACAT 
are known and, for example, a compound having the formula: 
has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Application 
No. Hei 2-6457. However, it is still desired to develop a therapeutic 
agent having more potent activity. The present inventors have studied the synthesis of a 
series of tricyclic heterocyclyl compounds and the 
pharmacological activity thereof for many years. As a 
result, they have discovered that tricyclic heterocyclyl 
compounds having specific substituents exhibit excellent 
activity in the inhibition of ACAT, and thus the present 
invention was accomplished. Tricyclic heterocyclyl compounds according to the 
invention have a general formula I: 
In the above formula, R¹ and R² are the same or 
different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower 
alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a halogen atom or a 
halogeno-lower alkyl group;
 
   R³ represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group;
 
   R⁴ represents a phenyl or naphthyl group, which has 
1 to 3 substituents and may optionally be condensed with a 
5- or 6-membered heterocyclyl group (the said substituent 
represents a lower alkyl, halogeno-lower alkyl, lower 
alkoxy
