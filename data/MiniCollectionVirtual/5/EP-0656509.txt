(5, 6) 

mechanically joined to the housing (1), each of the said bleed-pipes being connected at one end to cavities of the differential

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automatic devices 
to check furnace devices of various designs, mainly power 
boiler furnaces, and more specifically, devices for 
checking flame for presence. Up to now to check principle burners and ignition devices 
for flame presence, use has been made of electronic 
and opticoelectronic means, such as ionization indicators 
of burning that employ effects of conductivity variations 
and the valve effect of a burning zone, the generation of 
the burning zone radiation, the effects of absorbtion 
changes in various sections of the spectrum, luminosity 
fluctuations and thermoelectromotive forces. All the means mentioned above display an insufficient 
reliability. Thus, for instance, ionization devices 
are equipped with electroinsulated electrodes, inserted 
into flame. The deposits of soot, dust on the electrodes 
and insulators, precipitation of moisture on insulators 
with the ionization currents being specifically small, make 
the operation of said devices unreliable. The opticoelectronic 
indicators feature a low reliability because 
of a short service life of emitters and radiation receivers, 
sensitivity to contamination and low selectivity 
in flame checking. The main idea of the present invention is realization 
of a flame presence ckecking procedure, based on 
utilization of gas-dynamic effects, taking place during 
interaction of streams, flowing into the furnace volume, 
with the burning zone; as this takes place the stream 
flow can be either specially formed, or a stream flow of 
a burner device, like of an ignition nozzle, used. At the 
base of the invention is, in particular, a static pressure 
variation effect in the close-to-the-axis part of the 
twisted stream when it flows into the burning zone, and, 
namely, disappearance of rarefaction in the close-to-the  
 
axis part of the twisted stream during burning. Known is a device for flame checking, a stream flame 
detector, at the base of which is the dependence of 
the pneumatic throttle resistance on the temperature of 
the working mass with the consumption of said working 
mass being metered, for instance, by another throttle 
(SU- A- 1152324). Said device features a number of advantages over the 
ionization and opticoelectronic devices, and among other 
things, a high selectivity in flame checking and a zero 
sensitivity to radiant thermal flows. The indicated device for flame checking comprises a 
heat exchanger with an intershroud cavity and a heat-exchanging 
pipe, two throttles, one of which is
