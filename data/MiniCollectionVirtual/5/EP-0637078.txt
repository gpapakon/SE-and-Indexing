<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
semiconductor devices, and more specifically, to 
semiconductor devices with improved heat dissipation 
capabilities. Semiconductor devices inherently generate heat 
during operation. The heat must be dissipated so that 
the semiconductor device is maintained at an acceptable 
operating temperature. Many modern semiconductor devices 
have increased power dissipation which is directly 
related to the amount of heat generated. For example, 
high frequency analog amplifiers used in modern 
telecommunication circuits tend to be very high power 
devices. Similarly, the powerful microprocessors 
emerging in the industry tend to be high power and 
generate a great deal of heat. Additional heat dissipation issues arise in the 
case where the semiconductor device is configured as a 
"flip-chip". In flip-chip configuration, the surface of 
a semiconductor die which has an electronic device formed 
in it directly opposes a die attach substrate. The 
semiconductor die is typically attached to the die attach 
substrate only by conductive bumps which lead to the 
bonding pads of the semiconductor die. Typically, 
electrical traces printed on the die attach substrate 
lead from the bumps to provide interconnection to other 
circuit components. The described flip-chip configuration gives rise to 
heat dissipation problems because most of the heat 
generated by a semiconductor device is generated at the  
 
die surface containing the electronic device. In the 
flip-chip configuration, this surface is sandwiched 
against a die attach substrate which is typically a 
ceramic insulator that is a relatively poor heatsink. 
The majority of the heat generated by a flip-chip is 
conducted away from the flip-chip only through the 
conductive bumps and associated traces. The conductive 
bumps provide an extremely small surface area through 
which the heat must be dissipated. This results in 
undesirable localized hot points and heat gradients. What is needed is a semiconductor device with 
improved heat dissipation capability. A configuration 
would be desirable wherein a much greater surface area is 
utilized for conducting heat away from the surface of a 
semiconductor die. With regard to a flip-chip 
configuration, it would be desirable to efficiently 
couple the semiconductor die to the die attach substrate 
for maximized heat transfer. Briefly stated, the present invention comprises a 
semiconductor device with improved heat dissipation. The 
present invention comprises a
