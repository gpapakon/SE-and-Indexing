<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nonwoven fabrics made from 
melt-spun fibers. The fibers are made from melt-processable 
copolymers of monomers that contain acrylonitrile and 
methacrylonitrile in amounts such that the copolymers contain 
the acrylonitrile moiety of at least 30 weight percent, 
usually at least 50 weight percent acrylonitrile. The fibers 
can contain the acrylonitrile moiety in amounts as high as 
90 weight percent. For the purposes of this invention a fiber and a 
filament are synonymous. The fabrics of the present invention are made from 
fibers created by extruding a melt, as opposed to a solution, 
of the melt-processable copolymers through an orifice. This 
is usually accomplished in a spinarette, an assembly of 
multiple orifices, as will be understood by those skilled in 
the art. The copolymers used in the present invention are 
polymers of the addition polymerization of acrylonitrile (AN) 
and methacrylonitrile (MAN) and optionally other monomers 
having C=C double bonds that result in copolymers with the 
AN and MAN by addition polymerization. The copolymers of the present invention are melt-processable 
because of the way they are made. Previously, 
polymers formed by the addition polymerization of over 
20 weight percent AN with less than 80 weight percent MAN 
were unstable and subject to decomposition if worked as a 
melt. See Ball etal. U.S. patent 3,565,876 dated 
February 23, 1971. Briefly, one is enabled to make the melt-processable 
and stable polymer used in the present invention by 
copolymerizing the monomers in a polymerization zone to which 
are added the monomers, each at a substantially constant rate 
designed to form a copolymer of the desired composition, 
while keeping composition of the unreacted monomer mixture in  
 
said polymerization zone substantially constant. This is the 
key to avoiding long chains of the acrylonitrile moiety in 
the polymer molecule and consequently making the polymer that 
is melt-processable and stable at extrusion temperature and 
pressure conditions. This polymerization process in the 
polymerization zone can be effected in bulk, suspension, 
solution or emulsion polymerization systems, although 
suspension or emulsion polymerization are now preferred; a 
major reason for such preference is the superiority and 
economy of water as a heat transfer medium. In general we 
also now prefer emulsion polymerization to suspension because 
emulsion polymerization results in a faster polymerization 
rate using the monomers employed in making
