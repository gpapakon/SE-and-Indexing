<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a miniature potentiometer of 
the type including: 
a) an insulating vessel-shaped casing made of 
thermoplastic resin molded on a first sub-assembly 
comprising an electrically insulating support which 
supports an electro-resistant track having an incomplete 
annular shape with two extensions of electrically 
conductive material linked to a pair of connection 
terminals and extending outwardly from said casing and a 
collector plate having at least one connection terminal 
extending therefrom; b) a second subassembly housed in said casing and 
including a wiper integral with a wiper-holder having 
notches to facilitate rotation of said second sub-assembly, 
said first and second sub-assemblies being attached to one 
another by a tubular shaft of electrically conductive 
material which thereby establishes electrical contact 
between said wiper and said collector plate. The invention refers likewise to a process for 
automatically producing miniature potentiometers of the 
above type which proposes: 
a) for performing the first sub-assembly, a first 
continuous metallic laminar band, providing connection 
terminals and a collector plate and to an electro-resistant 
track, on which said casings are molded; b) for performing the second sub-assembly, a second 
metallic continuous band, including the wipers, on which 
the wiper-holders are molded; c) to perform the mechanical connection between the 
two sub-assemblies and the electrical contact between the 
collector plate and the wiper, a third band including 
connection parts in the form of metallic tubular shaft. As backgrounds of the invention we can mention 
following patents: GB 1.367.839 which deals with a process which  
 
comprises the steps of: 
advancing a continuous metallic laminar band 
hauled by a longitudinal conveying line with 
step-by-step forward movement, in which the 
terminals are initially shaped using dies, and 
further molding a housing body member about 
portions of the terminals members in respective 
unit lengths of the strip while leaving resilient 
contact portions of some contact fingers and end 
portions of the terminal members protruding from 
the body member and integral with the strip; producing rotors with conductive and resistive 
members thereon, and producing housing cover 
members; assembling a rotor and a cover member to 
respective body members and severing the 
potentiometers from the strip by shearing the 
terminal members adjacent the strip. US 2.958.839 which describes a potentiometer

folded 180 degrees against the bottom of said wiper-holder 

(19) thus defining a blunt fold length (38), said second 
part (33) further comprising a slight, medially located 

cross fold (33a) in opposite sense to said fold length 
(38) and at a distance thereof, which causes said second

(18) has several radial, peripheral protuberances (30) 
adapted to keep said wiper (18) connected to a strip (40) 

during a mounting process, said peripheral protuberances 
(30) being easily shearable by applying perpendicular 

stress to said strip (40) thus facilitating separation at 
the moment said wiper (18) is incorporated into the 

potentiometer. 
A miniature potentiometer, according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said annular plate (29) of said wiper 

(18) includes a large central opening (31) and through-holes

wiper-holder (19), during a molding operation. 
A miniature potentiometer, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said at least one connection terminal 

(17a, 17b) of said collector plate (16) comprises two 
terminals (17a, 17b) extending outwardly from said casing 

(10) in opposite directions, and wherein one of said 
terminals (17a or 17b) includes a 90-degree elbow extending 

parallel to said tubular shaft (21) to thereby define a 
fixed stop which engages a moving stop (25) radially 

protruding from the bottom of said shaft (21). 
A miniature potentiometer, according to claim 4 
characterized in that said moving stop (25) comprises a 

double wall portion (23) obtained by folding a strip-like 
portion( 26b) of a laminar plate connected to the bottom of 

said tubular shaft (21), said portion (26b) ending in a 
crown-shaped part (26a), against the bottom of said shaft 

(21), said crown-shaped part having grooves (24) formed 
therein. 
A miniature potentiometer, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said extensions (13) of said electro-resistant

both sides of said pair of connection terminals (14, 15), 
one end of each appendage (14b, 15b) being in contact with 

said resistant track (12) while the other end of each 
appendage (14
c, 15c) being in contact superimposed on said 
appendage ends (14b, 15b) provides retention, to thereby 

firmly secure said resistant track (12) to said pair of 
connection terminals before said casing (10) is molded. 
A process for automatically producing miniature 
potentiometers as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising the steps of: 


forming a first fixed subassembly including a 
casing (10), a resistant track (12), a collector (16) and terminals (17), 

in the form of a first continuous metallic laminar 
band, hauled by a longitudinal conveying line, with a 

step by step forward movement, in which the terminals 
are initially shaped using dies; 
configurating a second movable subassembly including 
a wiper (18) and a wiper-holder (19), on a second step by step 

advancing continuous band; 
coupling both subassemblies as to define a third 
continuous step by step advancing band, and 
mechanically and electrically checking 
potentiometers connected to said third continuous 

band, 
characterized
 in that 

a) said initial shaping of the terminals on said first 
band (39), includes before molding said casing, 

cutting two pairs of appendages (14b, 14c) (15b, 15c) 
in opposite areas at both sides of a section of said 

terminals (14, 15) which remains embedded in said 
casing (10) proximate a side wall thereof, one of said 

appendages (14b) being longer than the other, bending 
both appendages to a fork-shape to accommodate 

extensions of said resistant track (12), folding the 
longer appendage (14b) thereafter, under pressure, 

onto said extensions and folding said second appendage 
(14c) onto said first appendage (14b), thereby locking 

the appendages in place; and  
 
b) said step of coupling said two sub-assemblies is 
obtained using a third metallic continuous band (41), 

and further comprises the steps of gradually die 
cutting said third metallic band to form a tubular 

shaft (21) having an extension (26a), said extension 
being connected to a bottom of said shaft (21), said 

extension (26a) comprising a narrow strip-like portion 
(26b) which terminates in an annular portion (26a) 

with cross grooves (24); and producing a fold in 
approximately the middle of said strip-like portion 

(26b), so that said annular portion (26a) overlaps 
concentrically with the bottom of said shaft (21) and 

a radial extension of double wall is obtained by two 
contacting sections of said strip-like portion (26b), 

said process further comprising the steps of attaching 
the three bands (39, 40, 41), by superpositioning of 

said second and third bands (40) and (41) on opposite 
sides of said casing (10) and connecting the bands 

using said tubular shafts (21).

further comprising the steps of: 

folding said annular extension (33) concentrically 
over said annular plate (29), and 
providing a slight medial fold (33a) in said annular 
extension (33) so that the two arcuate arms (35, 36) 

project away from the center of said annular plate, said 
steps of folding and providing being conducted while said 

plate (29) and annular extension (33) remain connected to 
said second band (40).
