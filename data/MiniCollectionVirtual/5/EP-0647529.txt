<ABSTRACT>
An automatic print speed control for a barcode 
printer is shown, the printer includes a printhead 

to which power is applied during a strobe time to 
cause the printhead to print. The printer also 

includes a stepper motor that is responsive to a 
periodic drive signal for advancing a web of labels 

or the like past the printhead for printing 
thereon. The control is responsive to a number of 

measured operating variables of the barcode printer 
to adjust the printhead strobe time. The adjusted 

strobe time is compared to the period of the 
stepper motor drive signal in order to adjust the 

speed of the stepper motor if necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a barcode printer for
printing on a web of record members, said printer comprising:
a printhead to which power is supplied during a strobe
time to cause the printhead to print, a stepper motor responsive to a periodic drive signal for
advancing said web past said printhead for printing, means for measuring a plurality of operating variables
including the temperature of a heat sink on which the printhead
is mounted and the battery voltage, means responsive to said operating variables for
adjusting said printhead strobe time for printing on a record
member. Such a barcode printer is known from GB-A-2 138 190. That prior
art is concerned with the technical problem to apply substantial
constant energy to the print elements and maintain substantially
constant print density.The present invention is directed to an automatic print speed
control for a barcode printer that prints on tags,
labels and so like.Known barcode printers that are battery powered are typically
designed for worse case operating conditions including low
battery voltage, high printhead resistance, low printhead
temperature, etc. In particular, these known barcode printers
operate at one print speed under all operating conditions where
the print speed is selected so that the printer will adequately
print under the worse case operating conditions. Such barcode
printers have low throughput, as well as short battery operating
cycles.In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages of
prior battery powered barcode printers have been overcome. The
barcode printer 
of the present invention automatically adjusts the
print speed based on a number of measured operating
variables without utilizing, or minimizing the need
to utilize, lookup tables. Because the control of
the present invention does not utilize multiple
layers of nested lookup tables, the control
requires a minimum amount of memory; is easier to
program into software; and is easier to modify.More particularly, the barcode printer of the
present invention includes a printhead to which
power is applied during a strobe time to cause the
printhead to print. The barcode printer also
includes a stepper motor that is responsive to a
periodic drive signal for advancing a web of record
members such as tags, labels or the like past the
printhead for printing on the record members. The
automatic print speed control measures a number of
operating variables of the barcode printer. In
response to a plurality of those measured operating
variables, the

<CLAIMS>
A barcode printer (10) for printing on a web of record
members, said printer (10) comprising:


a printhead (12) to which power is supplied during a
strobe time to cause the printhead to print,
a stepper motor (14) responsive to a periodic drive
signal (15) for advancing said web past said printhead for

printing,
means (26, 28) for measuring a plurality of operating
variables including the temperature of a heat sink on which the

printhead is mounted and the battery voltage,
means (16) responsive to said operating variables for
adjusting said printhead strobe time for printing on a record

member, characterized by
means (16, 18, 20) for comparing said adjusted strobe
time to the period of said stepper motor drive signal (15) to

adjust the speed of said stepper motor if said strobe time is
within a given range of the period of the stepper motor drive

signal.
A barcode printer (10) according to claim 1,
characterized in said adjustment means includes means for

generating for one of said measured variables an offset value to
be added to a strobe time value, said offset generating means

determining the difference between a measured value and a
reference value for said one variable and applying a linear

relationship to said difference value to generate the offset
value for said one variable. 
A barcode printer according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that


said means for comparing said adjusted strobe time to the
period of said stepper motor drive signal determine whether said

adjusted strobe time is greater than or equal to a predetermined
percentage of the period of said stepper motor drive signal; and
means are provided responsive to said comparing means to
reduce the speed of said stepper motor if said adjusted strobe

time is greater than or equal to said percentage of the period
of said stepper motor drive signal.
A barcode printer according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized by


means for storing information representing a linear
equation for each of a plurality of said operating variables,

each of said equations defining how said strobe time is linearly
related to said respective operating variable; and
means for varying said strobe time according to each of a
plurality of said linear equations in response to each of a

plurality of respective measured operating variables.
A barcode printer according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized by means for comparing said adjusted

strobe time to a time value that varies with the speed of said
motor to determine whether said motor speed should be reduced.
