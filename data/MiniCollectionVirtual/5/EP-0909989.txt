<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing
method and an apparatus usable for the method. More
particularly it relates to a processing method that
can apply the desired patterning to semiconductors,
metals, insulators, etc., and an apparatus that can be
used for such patterning.One of important techniques in the fabrication
of semiconductor devices is photolithography. In the
photolithography, a complicated and cumbersome process
comprising the steps of resist coating, pattern
exposure, development, etching, resist removing, etc.
has been in wide use.In recent years, as typified by semiconductor
memory devices, there is a rapid progress in providing
devices with a larger capacity and their functions
with a higher performance. With such a progress,
circuit patterns are being made finer and also the
structure of circuits is being more complicated. As
for display devices such as liquid-crystal display
devices and plasma-display devices, they are being
made larger in size and device functions thereof are 
being made more complicated. Fabrication of these
devices by the use of the above processes may result
in an increase in cost because of the processes that
may be made more complicated, and may bring about a
decrease in yield because of an increase in generation
of dust to cause an increase in cost as a whole.Thin-film devices are mainly fabricated by a
process comprising the steps of forming on a substrate
a thin film of a metal, a semiconductor, an insulator
or the like, and finely processing the thin film to
have the desired pattern. In recent years, as
typified by semiconductor memory devices, there is a
rapid-progress in providing devices with a larger
capacity and their functions with a higher
performance. With such a progress, circuit patterns
are being made finer and also the structure of
circuits is being more complicated. As for display
devices such as liquid-crystal display devices and
plasma-display devices, they are being made larger in
size and device functions thereof are being made more
complicated. For this reason, film formation and also
etching for applying fine processing, which had been
carried out by a process making use of a solution, are
now mainly carried out by what is called a dry process
making use of plasma or excited gas in vacuum or in
pressure-reduced gas. The photolithography commonly 
used for applying the desired fine processing,
however, requires a complicated and cumbersome process
comprising the steps of resist coating, pattern
exposure, development, etching, resist
