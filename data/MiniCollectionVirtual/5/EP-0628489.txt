<ABSTRACT>
In this pallet box, the bottom section (7) of the container consists of a dihedral-shaped added element, comprising two articulated panels (7a-7b) forming a dihedral (10) with its edge parallel with the walls (4) of the body, these two panels (7a-7b) respectively adjoining the walls (4) by a section (8a) glued or stapled to these walls (4) and articulated to the associated panel (7a-7b) by a folding line disposed at the base of these walls (4) and extending over the entire length of this base. One of the panels (7a- 7b) is fixed by gluing or stapling to the angles, which are themselves fixed by gluing or stapling to the upper face of the pallet (1).

A box pellet comprising a container (2) of a semi-rigid 
material such as corrugated cardboard and a single rectangular pallet 

(1) of wood, with respect to which the container is fixed, said 
container comprising a bottom portion (7) which is fixed with respect 

to the pallet and a body (3) adjoining said bottom portion and capable 
of being folded flat into the plane of the upper surface of the pallet, 

the body (3) of the container being of a parallelepipedic shape of a 
cross-section substantially equal to the upper surface of the pallet 

and comprising four walls which are pivotally connected together by 
fold lines which, in the position of use of the box pallet, form edges 

which are perpendicular to the upper surface of the pallet, two 
parallel walls (5) of said body further comprising a central fold line 

(6) which is parallel to said edges and which divides them into two 
equal portions (5a-5b) so that they can be folded in an accordion 

configuration between the other two walls which are also parallel to 
each other; the body (3) of the container is open at its lower portion 

and the bottom portion (7) being formed by an added element in the form 
of a dihedron, comprising two flaps (7a-7b) which are pivoted so as to 

form a dihedron with an edge (10) parallel to the walls (4) of the body 
which do not have a central fold line and disposed in the same plane as 

the central fold lines (6) of the other two walls (5), said two flaps 
(7a-7b) respectively adjoining the walls (4) which do not have central 

fold lines by way of a portion (8a) which is glued or fastened on said 
walls (4) and pivoted on the associated flap (7a-7b) by a fold line 

disposed at the base of said walls (4) and extending over the entire 
length of said base; one of the flaps (7a-7b) of the dihedron forming 

the bottom portion (7) being laterally fixed by glueing or fastening 
with respect to two angle portions (9) of which one limb rests on the 

pallet perpendicularly to the edge (10) of the dihedron over 
substantially the entire length of the corresponding side of the pallet 

while the other limb thereof is perpendicular to the upper surface of 
the pallet so that in the position of use of the box pallet said limb 

is applied laterally against the base of the walls (5) of the body of  
 

the container comprising central fold lines (6); the angle portions (9) 
and possibly a flap (7b) of the bottom portion in the form of a 

dihedron which is fixed with respect to said angle portions are fixed 
by glueing or fastening on the upper surface of the pallet (1); said 

two flaps (7a, 7b) of the bottom portion of the container (2) are 
applied in the storage position of the box pallet against each other 

between the two angle portions (9) and the body (3) of the container is 
folded flat on the flaps (7a, 7b), also between the two angle portions 

(9). 
A box pallet according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
walls (5) of the body of the container which are divided into two equal 

portions (5a, 5b) by a central fold line (6) are internally lined by a 
reinforcing flap (12) adjoining the contiguous wall (4) by way of a 

fold line and fixed by glueing or fastening with respect to the 
contiguous portion (5b) of the wall (5) comprising the central fold 

line (6).
