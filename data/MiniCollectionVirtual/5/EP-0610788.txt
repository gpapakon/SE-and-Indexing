<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a countertop oven (10) having 
an upper member (12) and a lower member (11) which together 

define a cooking chamber, a rack (29) disposed within said 
cooking chamber for supporting food to be cooked, heating 

means (42, 78) for heating the air within said cooking 
chamber, and a blower (13, 41, 43), said blower comprising 

a blower wheel (43) located within said cooking chamber, 
characterised in that there is provided a hinged 

interconnecting member (14, 15, 17), said interconnecting 
holding said upper member and said lower member together 

during operation and permitting said upper member to be 
hingedly pivoted upwardly to provide access to the interior 

of said cooking chamber when the blower is not in 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cooking devices and 
more particularly to cooking devices using a high velocity 
air current to rapidly cook food product. A wide variety of cooking devices have been provided in 
the past. The conventional oven is illustrative of such 
cooking devices. Simple Ovens in various forms have been in 
use for centuries in homes, commercial bakeries, institutional 
kitchens and restaurants. Conventional ovens have been provided in a variety of 
models and sizes, for example, a permanent, built-in style, 
mounted in cabinetry, together with or independent of a stove 
top unit. Conventional ovens have also been provided of a 
portable design. While the conventional oven remains a basic 
essential cooking unit in the home as well as restaurants or 
the like, conventional ovens do have their shortcomings. 
Conventional ovens, for example, tend to cook slowly and thus 
consume a good deal of the user's time. Attempts have been made to overcome this problem; for 
example, microwave ovens have become popular. While 
microwave ovens cook rapidly, they too have their shortcomings. 
For example, it is difficult to brown food in a 
microwave oven. Other attempts at solving the slowness of conventional 
ovens has been to include a circulating fan to move the air 
in the oven. While such circulating fans have provided more 
rapid cooking, the time required is still very substantial.  
 
Such existing ovens perform their tasks in a similar way. 
The majority of such cooking devices consist of a rectangular 
oven, usually equipped with a plurality of racks, much like 
that found in conventional in-home ovens. Often at the rear 
of the oven is a squirrel-cage type blower which draws the 
air through a hole in the interior rear wall and blows the 
air out to the sides, where is it directed to perforations in 
the two interior side walls. This pressurized air is then 
forced through the perforations toward the rear center of the 
oven enclosure, where it is drawn into the blower intake hole 
and re-circulated, thereby completing a closed loop. An oven 
produced by Rair follows the above pattern with the exception 
of circulating the air through a cylindrical chamber with its 
axis positioned horizontally. Air velocities within the cooking chamber of such ovens 
vary widely, depending on the proximity to the blower intake 
and the air inlet holes. The velocities are generally the 
highest just in front of the blower intake. A typical 
average airspeed found in a commercial restaurant convection

<CLAIMS>
A countertop oven (10) having an upper member (12) and 
a lower member (11) which together define a cooking 

chamber, a rack (29) disposed within said cooking 
chamber for supporting food to be cooked, heating 

means (42, 78) for heating the air within said cooking 
chamber, and a blower (13, 41, 43), said blower 

comprising a blower wheel (43) located within said 
cooking chamber, characterised in that there is 

provided a hinged interconnecting member (14, 15, 17), 
said interconnecting holding said upper member and 

said lower member together during operation and 
permitting said upper member to be hingedly pivoted 

upwardly to provide access to the interior of said 
cooking chamber when the blower is not in operation. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 further 
comprising a safety switching mechanism (68) which 

renders the blower inoperative when said upper member 
is pivoted upward. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 wherein said 
upper member comprises a circumferential wall (31), a 

generally planar top wall (32), and an arcuate wall 
connecting together the circumferential wall and the 

top wall. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 3 wherein said 
top wall has an opening (32') in the centre thereof, 

said blower and said heating means being mounted in 
said
 opening. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1, further 
comprising at least one extension ring which may be 

selectively inserted between the upper and lower 
members so as to increase the height of the cooking 

chamber. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 5 wherein said 
interconnecting member comprises at least one 

extension segment which may be selectively added to 
increase the height of the interconnecting member in 

an amount equal to the increase in height of the 
cooking chamber. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 wherein said 
interconnecting member comprises a substantially L-shaped 

lower frame bracket (14) attached to the lower 
member, a substantially L-shaped upper frame bracket 

(15) attached to the upper member, said upper and 
lower frame brackets being pivotable with respect to 

each other. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 7 wherein said 
interconnecting member further comprises a pin (17) 

 
for pivotally connecting together said upper and lower 

frame brackets. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 wherein said 
upper and lower members are made of plastic. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 wherein said 
blower comprises a second blower blade (63) which 

draws fresh air over the motor so as to cool the motor 
and expels said fresh air over an upper surface of the 

upper member so as to cool the upper member. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 wherein said 
lower member comprises an upwardly opening bowl-shaped 

member and said upper member comprises a downwardly 
opening bowl-shaped member. 
A countertop oven according to Claim 1 wherein said 
interconnecting member may be separated from said 

upper and lower members for cleaning or storage.
