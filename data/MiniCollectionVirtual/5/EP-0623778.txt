<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for testing pipes for internal leakages, having two sections (1,2) which are arranged in a mirror-inverted manner with respect to one another and of which each exhibits at least one clamping device (3,4) and at least one pair of rollers, as well as a pneumatic pressure-fluid source (P), an inspection arrangement, a sealing arrangement and a control arrangement. Each section exhibits an outer cylinder (6,7), at least one central cylinder (8,9) which is concentrically mounted in said outer cylinder such that it can be displaced, and at least one inner cylinder (10,11) which is concentrically mounted in said central cylinder such that it can be displaced. The two inner cylinders of the two sections are connected to the common pneumatic pressure-fluid source in order thus to use the pneumatic energy for the internal-pressure testing also for the hydropneumatic advancement of the two sections, which can be moved with respect to one another.
