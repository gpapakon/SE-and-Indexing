<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speed change
control method for an automotive automatic
transmission.An automotive automatic transmission is
generally provided with a controller for determining,
in accordance with a shift pattern set beforehand, a
gearshift position suitable to a running condition of
a vehicle, based on detected pieces of information
such as throttle opening, vehicle speed, and a
gearshift position currently established. The
transmission is operable to automatically establish an
optimum gearshift position under the control of the
controller. In a typical shift pattern, a group of
upshift lines for upshift operations from lower
gearshift positions to higher gearshift positions, and
a group of downshift lines for downshift operations
from higher gearshift positions to lower gearshift
positions, are set as a function of throttle opening
and vehicle speed, as exemplarily shown in Figs. 1 and
2. When the vehicle running condition changes from a
region indicated by numeral "1" in Fig. 1 to a region
indicated by numeral "2," for instance, an upshift
operation from the first speed to the second speed
takes place. Also, a downshift operation from the
fifth speed to the fourth speed takes place when the 
vehicle running condition changes from a region
indicated by numeral "5" to a region indicated by
numeral "4," for instance. Likewise, an upshift or
downshift operation between other regions also takes
place.In this manner, the shift pattern is set such
that a gearshift position for higher speed is selected
at a lower vehicle speed region if the throttle
opening is small, whereas a gearshift position for
lower speed is selected in a higher vehicle speed
region if the throttle opening is large. Thus, even
if a vehicle runs on a descending road, a gearshift
position for higher speed by comparison with vehicle
speed is selected when the throttle opening is made
small, so as to operate an engine in a lower
rotational speed region. That is, an upshift can take
place when the throttle is restored during the vehicle
running on a descending road. Thus, engine braking is
sometimes refused to work effectively when the vehicle
runs on a descending road. In this case, the vehicle
speed increases, and hence a braking force is needed,
so that a driver is required to operate a foot brake,
or operate a select lever for switching drive ranges
so as to cause engine braking to exercise.To obviate such a drawback, an automatic
transmission has been proposed, in which a downshift
takes place when it is determined
