amplifier having a non-inverting input terminal, an 

inverting input terminal and an output terminal with an 
RC active filter connected across the output terminal 

and the inverting input terminal, means for supplying

resistor (R1R), of which one end is connected to the 

second audio signal input terminal, respectively, and a 
third resistor (R3) connected between the connection 

node of the first and the second input resistors and a 
reference potential source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
audio signal processing circuit, and more particularly 
to a low frequency audio signal intensifying circuit. Previously, it has been found to be desirable to 
intensify low frequency sound signals in TV receivers, 
stereo sets and other such devices to enjoy a powerful 
sound. Figure 1 shows a conventional audio signal 
processing circuit for intensifying a prescribed low 
band audio signal. In the drawing, reference numeral 1 
denotes an input terminal to which a left channel audio 
signal 50L is input. Reference numeral 2 denotes 
another input terminal to which a right channel audio 
signal 50R is input. These left and right channel 
audio signals 50L and 50R applied through the left and 
right channel input terminals 1 and 2 are then applied 
to adders 4 and 5, respectively, and also to an audio 
signal mixing circuit 6. This audio signal mixing 
circuit 6 mixes the left and right channel input audio 
signals 50L and 50R with each other to form a monaural 
audio signal 51 and leads this monaural audio signal to 
a band-pass filter 7. As this band-pass filter 7 
admits only audio signals in the band around the 
resonance frequency (fo) of the left and the right 
loudspeakers (not shown) to pass through it, only a 
band component 52 out of the monaural signal 51 is 
output from the band-pass filter 7 and then led to the 
adders 4 and 5. Therefore, the adder 4 adds the low frequency 
audio signal 52 output from the band-pass filter 7 to 
the left channel audio signal 50L and outputs the 
resulting left channel audio signal to a left channel 
output terminal 8. Further, the adder 5 adds the low 
frequency audio signal 52 also output from the bandpass 
filter 7 to the right channel audio signal 50R and 
then outputs the resulting right channel audio signal  
 
to a right channel output terminal 9. As a result, the 
left and right channel audio signals having the 
frequency characteristic curve b as shown in Figure 2 
are obtained from the adders 4 and 5. The low 
frequency audio signal 52 output from the band-pass 
filter 7 has the frequency characteristic curve b with 
its band component around the loudspeaker's resonance 
frequency Fo being intensified in contrast to the 
frequency characteristic curve a of the input audio 
signals 50L and 50R, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the detail of the audio signal 
mixing circuit 6 shown in Figure 1. The left and the 
right channel audio input signals 50L and 50R are 
applied to the inverting (-) input
