<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates generally to a method of increasing creatine supply depot of mammals having no disorders in the creatine metabolism, viz. healthy, thereby increasing muscular strength, shortening the period of re-establishment of phosphorous compounds in energy after work and increasing the body of the muscles. This is achieved by the administration of creatine to the mammals in an amount of at least 15 grammes, or 0.2 - 0.4 g/kg body weight or preferably about 0.3 g/kg body weight, per day for at least 2 days. The invention describes the use creatine for the manufacturing of a preparation to increase the muscle performance ability in an amount which supplies a daily dose as stated above and a method.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD OF INCREASING CREATINE SUPPLY DEPOTDescription of the invention.The invention relates generally to a preparation for increasing the muscle performance ability in mammals having no disorders in the creatine metabolism, and thereby increasing muscular strength, shortening the period of re-establishment of phospho¬ rous compounds in energy after work and increasing the body of the muscles. This is achieved by the administration of creatine to the mammals in an amount of at least 15 grammes, or 0.2 - 0.4 g/kg body weight or preferably about 0.3 g/kg body weight, per day for at least 2 days. The invention describes the use of creatine for the manufacturing of a prepare- tion comprising creatine in an amount which supplies a daily dose as stated above, as well as a method to increase the muscle per- formance ability in mammals having no disorder in the creatine metabolism by supplying a daily dosage of at least 15 grammes, or 0.3 g/kg body weight, optionally divided in several doses.It is well established that creatine phosphate is the substrate in muscular tissue which gives the fastest resynthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and through this is used at maximum or nearly maximum power production. The resynthesis speed of ATP is nearly twice as high from creatine phosphate than from glycogen (the carbohydrate in muscle) and we have been able to show that muscle contraction with maximum power empties the creatine phosphate supply (Hultman et al Biochem. Soc. Trans 1991; 19, 347-354). Even the oxidative resynthesis of energy substrate after work is effected positively by increased creatine amounts in the muscle tissue. It has therefore been suggested that a positive relationship exists between the amount of creatine in the muscle and the power production on repeated work with short breaks for resting. 

Creatine is not sythesized in muscle tissue but is supplied to the muscle via the blood stream - partly from synthesis in liver, kidney and pancreas, and partly from the intake via food. The blood concentration of creatine is in the order of 50 μmol per liter blood and from this level a creatine uptake to the muscle tissue takes place via an active transport. The creatine excre¬ tion in the form of creatinine varies with the size of the muscle mass and reaches 0.2-2 g per day in a normal weight person.Attempts have been made to improve the muscle power by in¬ creasing the creatine content in muscle. Creatine has been administered in different forms and in combination with other substances in
