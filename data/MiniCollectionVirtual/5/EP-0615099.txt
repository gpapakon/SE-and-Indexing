<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fluid distribution network comprising a flow and pressure controller. According to the invention, the device comprises a member (74), to which a force representative of the flow is applied, and a member (71), to which a force representative of the difference in pressure at the limits of use is applied. These two members are joined together so that one of them closes or opens at least partially a control branch pipe (6) between fluid feed pipe and fluid return pipe as a function of the difference in these two forces, more precisely to keep said flow and said pressure difference constant.

Fluid distribution system including a source (1) 
of fluid, a set (2) of fluid circuits, each including at 

least one fluid convector apparatus through which the 
said fluid flows, a fluid delivery conduit (3) joining 

the outlet of the source and the inlet of the set of 
circuits, a fluid return conduit (4) joining the outlet 

of the set of circuits and the inlet of the source (1), 
and a regulating device including a variable flow-rate 

regulating conduit (6) joining the delivery conduit (3) 
and the return conduit (4), the regulating conduit (6) 

enclosing a movable member for controlling flow-rate (71) 
which is sensitive to the pressure difference between two 

of the points (C, D) in the said regulating conduit, and 
the member for controlling flow-rate (71) being movable 

between a position of closing of the regulating conduit 
(6) and a position of maximum opening of this 

regulating conduit, a fluid distribution system characterized 
in that the regulating device includes a conduit 

for measuring (5) flow-rate, fitted as a bypass on the 
delivery conduit (3), in that the movable member for

pressure difference between two points (A, B) in the said 
conduit for measuring flow-rate is connected to the 

conduit for measuring (5) flow-rate, and the member for 
controlling flow-rate (71) is movable as a function both 

of the pressure difference between the said two  
 

points (A, B) in the measuring conduit (5) and of the 
pressure difference between the said two points (C, D) in 

the regulating conduit (6), so as to keep constant the 
flow-rate in the part of the delivery conduit to which 

the measuring conduit is fitted as a bypass, and the 
pressure at the terminals of the regulating conduit.
