<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to equipment for
changing, weakening or destroying biological structures
in vivo and in vitro by means of a magnetic gradient
field.Magnetism and magnetically responsible particles
have been used for a long time in various biochemical and
medical applications. When paramagnetic materials are exposed
to an externally alternating homogeneous magnetic
field, heat is generated due to hysteresis. This generation
of heat, in particular in combination with superparamagnetic
nanoparticles, is used in cancer therapy and
is then referred to as magnetic fluid hyperthermia (1).
A cancer cell normally has a higher temperature than a
healthy cell and therefore does not tolerate as high a
temperature rise as a healthy cell. Thus, the cancer
cells can be selectively destroyed or weakened without
affecting the host organism. An alternative method is
that the composition of the superparamagnetic particles
is of such type that cancer cells are made to take in
said particles into the cell, whereby the temperature is
raised more efficiently in the cancer cell without any
considerable heat loss to the environment. This type of
therapy has been found to be promising, which is described,
inter alia, in the patent literature (2, 3, 4,
5), even if there is no clinically approved magnetic
equipment for this purpose for the time being.A cell membrane is, inter alia, composed of lipids
and fatty acids, which both have poor thermal conductivity,
which makes it difficult to fight the target cell
efficiently with only extracellular heat generated by
hysteresis.Document US-A-4 662 359 discloses a cancer treatment
method and device which utilize a helical coil surrounding
the organism for producing a high fequency alternating electromagnetic
field in combination with means for producing a static field. According to the present invention, a device is provided
which solves the above-mentioned problems. Thus, a
device is provided for increasing the thermal and/or kinetic
energy of magnetically responsible particles, said
device containing at least two magnetic field generating
means, of which at least one is a coil, between which
means an alternating magnetic gradient field can be generated
in a spatially defined area, into which spatially
defined area human or animal tissue can be introduced,
said alternating magnetic gradient field causing an increase
of the thermal and/or kinetic energy of magnetically
responsible particles which have been added to said
tissue, the increased thermal and/or kinetic energy
