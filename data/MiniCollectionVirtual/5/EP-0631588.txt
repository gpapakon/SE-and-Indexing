<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to adhesives containing low-colour 
hydrocarbon resins with good compatibility with styrenic 
block copolymers, such as SIS and SBS, and to resin/block 
copolymer blends having good properties as an adhesive 
composition. These compositions may be used in adhesive 
label or sanitary (diaper) applications. Mixed olefinic/aromatic tackifier resins have been prepared 
from a wide variety of feedstocks including 
(a) Cut piperylene (piperylene concentrate) of which 1,3-pentadiene 
is a main component and C5 olefins are a 
minor component. (b) Steam cracker olefins: mainly composed of Pentene-2, 2-methyl-butenes 
1,2 and cyclopentene. Steam cracker 
olefins is predominantly mono-olefinic. (c) Heart cut distillate containing vinyltoluenes and 
indene as main components but also containing styrenics 
such as styrene and alpha-methylstyrene. Some 
styrenics have a lowering effect on softening point.  
 (d) Other aromatics (especially Indenics) tend to increase 
softening point. (e) Cyclopentadiene and dicyclopentadiene which have a 
broadening effect on molecular weight distribution and 
tend to increase the softening point. Specific disclosures include : Tackifiers for SBS with relatively low molecular weights 
prepared by using a Friedel-Crafts catalyst and polymerising 
a mixture of C5/C6 (di)olefins and C8/C10 aromatics are 
disclosed in US-A-4078132 (Lepert) and EP-A-23456 (Evans). 
The softening points are low in EP-A-23456 (Evans). In Lepert Example 12 molecular weights and aromaticity are 
high. However the material does not tackify SBS satisfactorily. 
Ball tack is 4 to 30 cm and so is too high. In Evans such high amounts of chain transfer agent (mono-olefins) 
are used that the softening point is very low. The 
product will not provide a good adhesive/cohesive performance 
in SBS blends. The liquid resin serves to substitute the oil 
in hot melt adhesive (HMA) but cohesive performance is 
reduced. US 3784 530 (Goodyear) describes a hydrocarbon resin tackifier 
having a softening point of from 60 to 110째C prepared by 
polymerizing piperylene, 2-methyl-2-butene, dicyclopentadiene 
and alpha-methyl styrene. The polymerization uses Friedel-Crafts 
catalyst systems. At least 15% of 2-methyl-2-butene is 
used in the feed stream which also contains appreciable 
amounts of piperylene and dicyclopentadiene components and an 
aromatic component in the form of the alpha-methyl styrene.  
 The resulting resin is not hydrogenated. It is said to be 
suitable for tackifying natural and

<CLAIMS>
An adhesive composition comprising 12 to 35 wt % of an 
SBS and or SIS blockcopolymer and 65 to 30 wt % of a low-colour 

hydrocarbon resin of a softening point of from 
75 to 110째C and an Mw/Mn as determined by GPC of less 

than 2 prepared by: 

(1) preparing a resin from a feed containing a 
piperylene stream and an olefinic cracker stream 

to provide a diolefin/olefin ratio (D/O) of from 
1/10 to 1/1 and a heart cut distillate stream 

containing C

 aromatics to provide at least 
5 wt % of indenic feed material using Friedel-Crafts 

catalyst to provide a resin having an 
aromaticity of at least 25 preferably at least 

30%; and 
(2) hydrogenating the resin to an extent whereby less 
than 80% of the aromatic structures are 

hydrogenated so as to provide an aromaticity of 
from 15 to 25% equivalent wt % styrene as 

determined by the number of aromatic protons using 
proton NMR. 
An adhesive according to claim 1 in which the feed 
contains from 5 to 30 wt % of the piperylene stream; 

30 to 60 wt % of the olefin cracker stream and 
from 65 to 10 wt % of the heart cut distillate; and 

optionally no more than 15 wt %, preferably 10 wt % of 
a separate branched chain olefin stream said wt % being 

calculated on the total weight of feedstream excluding 
an inert solvent.  

 
An adhesive according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which 
the hydrogenation is at 180 to 200째C in continuous or 

batch form. 
An adhesive according to any of 1 to 3 which the 
hydrogenated resin has a melt viscosity at a shear rate 

of 50 sec

than 300 in mPa.s at 160째C. 
An adhesive according to any of the preceding claim in 
which the blockcopolymer has a styrene content of from 

20 to 60 wt %, preferably from 25 to 50 wt %. 
An adhesive according to any of the preceding claims in 
which the blockcopolymer contains no more than 5 wt %
