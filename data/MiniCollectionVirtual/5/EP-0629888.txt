<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement is proposed which consists of a flat board (1) having a multiplicity of V-grooves (7) and a lid (2) having a multiplicity of V-shaped grooves (8), in the case of which arrangement the board (1) and the lid (2) are joined and adjusted with respect to each other such that the grooves (7, 8) form channels of rhombus-shaped cross-section. The sharpened optical fibres (4) are slid into these channels up to a stop (9, 10) and are then automatically adjusted to form a laser array (3) arranged on the board (1).

<CLAIMS>
A device for the precisely adjusted coupling of a plurality of optical
waveguides to a laser array (3), comprising a flat plate (1), a flat cover (2), and

means (5, 6) for their precise adjustment relative to one another, wherein the
plate and the cover are provided with an identical number of V-shaped grooves

(7) which form rhombic channels following the fining together of plate and cover,
characterised in that


a) those ends of the rhombic channels which face towards the laser array
taper in conical fashion and
b) between the ends of the rhombic channels and the laser array there is a
gap which is formed by a space between the plate and the cover and is

delimited by the surfaces of the plate and cover which are flat in this
region.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the adjusting means
consist of at least three truncated-cone-shaped recesses (5) which are arranged in

the plate and the cover and each of which contains a ball (6).
A device according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that plate (1) and
cover (2) consist of silicon in which the grooves (7, 8) and the recesses (5) are

formed by anisotropic etching.
A device according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the balls (6)
consist of glass.
