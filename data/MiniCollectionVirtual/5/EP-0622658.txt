<ABSTRACT>
Pixel electrodes in the periphery of a thin film transistor array 
(peripheral part of the display screen) of an active matrix type liquid 

crystal display device are directly electrically shortcircuited with 
signal lines (3), whereby an alternating current signal is always 

applied to the pixel electrodes without being passed through a thin film 
transistor (1) as a switching element. Thereby the liquid crystal 

arranged on the peripheral part of the display screen is driven in a 
static state resulting in a high stability against the display 

characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active matrix 
type liquid crystal display device used in a liquid crystal 
display panel or a liquid crystal light valve, etc. Today, display devices using liquid crystal (liquid 
crystal display devices) have been applied in various kinds 
of field such as finders of video cameras, pocket TVs, highly 
fine projector-type TVs, and personal computers, word 
processors or the like data display terminals. The development 
and commercialization of the above display devices are 
proceeded lively. Particularly, an active matrix type liquid 
crystal display device of all draws a passionate attention, 
because it ensures high quality of the image. The active 
matrix type is a contractive driving method of liquid crystal 
to the conventionally-employed simple matrix type. More 
specifically, in the active matrix driving method, each pixel 
electrode disposed on the matrix is provided with a switching 
element, to which is independently supplied an electric signal 
to control the optical characteristic of the liquid crystal 
through the switching element. Therefore, the active matrix  
 
driving method can maintain high contrast even at the time of 
a large-capacity display, without accompanying crosstalk, not 
alike the conventional simple matrix method. Currently, a thin film transistor is mainly used for 
the switching element in the active matrix driving method. 
Fig. 3 is a schematic equivalent circuit diagram of an active 
matrix type liquid crystal device using a thin film transistor 
array according to the prior art. As indicated in Fig. 5, a thin film transistor (TFT) 
1 as a switching element provided for each pixel electrode 
supplies an electric signal of a signal line 3 to the subject 
pixel electrode when the transistor 1 is selected by a 
scanning line 2. The signal line 3 is electrically insulated 
from the pixel electrode when the thin film transistor 1 is 
not selected. When the scanning line 2 makes no selection, 
the pixel potential is held by a liquid crystal capacitor 5 
formed between the pixel electrode and a counter electrode 4 
confronting the pixel electrode via a liquid crystal layer. 
Therefore, it is generally practiced that a storage capacitor 
6 is formed at the side of the TFT 1 parallel to the liquid 
crystal capacitor 5 via the pixel electrode and the insulating 
layer so as to improve the voltage retention efficiency of the 
pixel electrode when the scanning line 2 does not select the 
transistor. The stability of the pixel potential
