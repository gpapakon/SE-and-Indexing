<ABSTRACT>
A lock for a sliding door, the lock having at least 
one locking bolt adapted in use to be moved between an open 

position and a locking position by activation of an 
operating member which rotates a pinion which engages a pair 

of drive racks to cause movement of the locking bolt 
generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bolt and 

in a direction parallel to a leading edge of a door in which 
the lock is mounted, the locking bolt being adapted when 

moved to its locking position to move into locking 
engagement with a staple-like keep mounted on a frame for 

the door when the door is in a closed position, there being 
a key operated deadlock facility which will prevent 

activation of the operating member. Preferably, the lock is 
also fitted with a safety mechanism so that it cannot be 

damaged if the door to which it is fitted is closed when the 
lock is in a locking position, and it is also possible to 

provide both an automatic latching and a panic feature on 
the lock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lock for a sliding door. 
Although the lock has been specifically designed for sliding 
doors such as patio doors, it could be used for other 
sliding members, such as cupboard doors, windows, and the 
like. Traditionally, locks for sliding doors have hook type 
bolts or mushroom headed bolts which protrude from the 
leading edge of the lock stile of the door and when the door 
is moved to a closed position, these bolts are either swung 
in an arc or slid bodily in a vertical direction to engage 
with a suitable keep member mounted in the door frame. In 
the case of a hook bolt, the keep member could be in the 
form of a bar, or an eye or staple, and in the case of a 
mushroom headed bolt, the keep member is normally a keyhole 
slot with the enlarged portion being sufficiently large to 
accommodate the head of the bolt, which is then slid behind 
the narrow portion of the keyhole slot. While such styles 
of lock operate satisfactorily and provide a secure closure, 
they suffer from the major disadvantage that they protrude 
from the lock stile at the leading edge of the door and can 
cause injury, catch on clothing, and generally look 
unsightly. The present invention seeks to provide a lock which 
does not suffer from the above disadvantages. Very often door locks of the above-described prior art 
types are fitted with an anti-slam device which is in the 
form of a further member projecting from the leading edge of 
the lock stile and so long as this remains in its projecting 
position, the lock is prevented from being moved to a 
locking position. Normally, when the sliding door is moved 
to a closed position, the projecting member will be caused 
to move against a spring bias so that it no longer projects 
from the lock stile and this then allows the lock to be 
moved to a locking position. Apart from suffering from the  
 
disadvantages mentioned above, anti-slam devices of the 
above-described known type also suffer from the disadvantage 
that they are difficult to fit due to the normal tolerances 
experienced between a sliding door and its frame and in 
practice this means that the projecting member of any anti-slam 
device fitted to a door has to be purpose made for the 
door, otherwise when the door is closed it may be moved into 
a lock stile by an insufficient amount (or it may be moved 
into the stile too far) to prevent satisfactory operation of 
the lock. As a preferred feature, the lock of the present 
invention is so designed that even if the lock has been 
move
