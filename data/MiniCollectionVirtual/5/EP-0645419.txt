<ABSTRACT>
A porous polyvinylchloride (PVC) material with a cellular, 5-98 percent cross-linked structure is obtained by 
aggregation treatment of a powder, emulsion-like, or microsuspension PVC material with subsequent 

heating at 190-300 
o
C 
for 3-15 min. Aggregation treatment includes forming the PVC material at 0.5-400 MPa and 

20-170 
o
C up to a density of 0.85-1.38 
g/cm³, or granulation of the PVC material with subsequent separation of the fraction with the 

size of granules from 0.2 to 
4.0 mm and its pressure-free forming in the form of a layer with the height of 4-16 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to porous polyvinylchloride (PVC)
materials and their production methods.It is known, that light porous PVC materials with
improved physical and mechanical properties, e.g. high
elasticity and thermostability, very often are multicomponent
systems, including a number of specially aimed additives:
foaming, stabilizing and cross-linking agents, fillers,
lubricants, etc. However, introduction of specially aimed
additives, which improve some properties, causes worsening of
other ones and increase of the materials cost.There is known a porous material, consisting of PVC
without any additive, which is characterized by a total
porosity of 48-49% and by a pore max. diameter of 18-22 microns
(The USSR Inventor's Certificate No. 651014, C O8 J 9/24// B
29 D 27/08,published in 1979).Reproduction of this material
showed, that it has a corpuscular pore structure,
characterized by an apparent density of 0.72 g/cu.cm, an open
porosity of 49% an average diameter of open pores of 15 microns and
absence of cross-linking (the insoluble fraction amount is
zero); its elasticity (measured as a minimal diameter of the
roller, around which the material bends without failure) is
35 mm. The material destruction rate under vacuum at 175°C,
which characterizes its thermostability, is 1.25.10-6 mg
HCl/g PVC.s. The relation of breaking stress at tension to
apparent density is 4.3 MPa.cu.cm/g.From this reference there is known the method of porous
material production by molding PVC powder in a cold state by
a roller, the lower layer of not treated PVC and upper layer
of PVC preliminary thermally treated at 100-150°C, or the
lower and the upper layers, of thermally treated PVC and the
interfacial layer of not treated PVC, are being applied on
the backing with the following heating at 200°C for 3 mins.
or at 280°C for 1 min.The proximate to the suggested material according to the
technical concept is the known porous material of PVC
(unspecified) containing no additives, characterized by a total
porosity of 49-50% and pore a max. diameter of 25-30 microns,
which has an elasticity (determined by the above mentioned
method) of 30 mm and a tensile strength of 3.5-5.0 MPa (The USSR
Inventor's Certificate No. 439497, C O8 J 47/08, published in
1974). Reproduction of this material showed, that it has a
corpuscular pore structure, characterized by an apparent density
of 0.70-0.72 g/cu.cm, an open porosity of 50%, an average diameter 
of open pores of 20 microns and absence of cross-linking (the
insoluble fraction is
