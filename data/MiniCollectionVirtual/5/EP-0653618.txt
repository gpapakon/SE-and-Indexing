<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an instrument for measuring
the viscoelastic properties of rubber and like materials. More
particularly, the invention relates to an instrument having two
opposed dies adapted to contain between them under pressure a sample
of material to be tested, means to apply an oscillatory rotary torque
to one of said dies, means for measuring said torque or the torque
induced in the other die, and means for deriving information on the
properties of the material from such measurements. Examples of such
instruments are described in GB-A-1247371, US-A-4552025 and
US-A-4584882.Using an essentially sinusoidal oscillatory torque, useful parameters
for characterising viseoelastic materials derivable from such
measurements are the elastic or storage modulus S', the viscous or
loss modulus S" and the tangent of the loss angle (delta) which is
the ratio S"/S'. S' can be calculated from the torque measured at
maximum displacement, while S" can be calculated from the torque at
zero displacement, or alternatively by taking multiple samples of
torque during each cycle and extracting S' and S" using Fourier
transform calculations as described in European Patent EP-B 0313540.Such instruments have been developed mainly to monitor the change in
properties of vulcanisable rubber compounds during vulcanisation. In
a typical test, a sample of the rubber compound is held under
pressure between the dies at a fixed temperature appropriate to the
rubber under test. As crosslinking of the rubber proceeds during
vulcanisation, it is usual for the sample to contract. Such 
contraction can lead to slippage between the sample and the dies and
hence to incorrect values for the torque measurements. The problem
is most likely to occur towards and after the end of vulcanisation,
and can therefore be serious if information on the behaviour of the
rubber at that period is required. The problem can be alleviated by
suitable design of the dies. For example, the die system described
in US-A-4552025 has discontinuous annular protrusions, while the dies
in a commercial instrument have radial grooves. A proposal for
dealing with the problem of slippage is made in CA-A-833240 with
reference to a rheometer instrument in which shear is applied to a
sample of test material by means of an oscillating rotor embedded in
the sample in a pressurised cavity. It is pointed out that in
addition to slippage due to crosslinking, slippage can also occur
when the temperature of the sample is reduced. The proposal of
CA-A-833240 is

<CLAIMS>
A method for the characterization of viscoelastic
materials in which a sample of material is held under

pressure and temperature between two opposed,
temperature-controlled dies (33, 51) and in which the sample

is subjected to an oscillatory, rotary shearing force by
oscillatory rotation of one of said dies (33, 51) relative

to the other, and a torque which is indicative of the
response of the sample to the shearing force is measured,


characterised in that
 at least once during its residence
between the dies (33, 51) the sample is (i) cooled at least

20° C and, if necessary, the resultant pressure drop is
limited to avoid slippage between the sample dies (33, 51)

and (ii) reheated, and information on the viscoelastic
characteristics of the sample is derived from the torque

measurements at least during the cooling.
A method according to claim 1 in which the sample is
cooled to 30°C or below.
A method according to claim 1 in which the average
rate of reheating is at least 1°C per second.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3 in which
the material is a vulcanisable elastomer composition and the

sample is initially cooled and reheated at least once before
the onset of vulcanisation, and torque measurements are

continued during a final cooling of the sample after
vulcanisation is complete.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4 in which
the torque values are corrected in response to changes in a

gap (62) between the dies (33,51).
Apparatus for testing a sample of viscoelastic
material comprising two opposing, relatively-rotatable dies

(33, 51) which are moveable between an open position and a
closed position, and which are adapted, when in a closed

position, to be separated by a gap (62) and to hold between
them a sample under pressure in a cavity defined by the

opposing faces of the dies (33, 51) and a peripheral seal
(35, 35'), means for heating the dies (47, 54), means for

controlling the temperatures of the dies, means for sensing
the temperature of the dies, means for sensing the pressure in

the cavity, means for effecting an oscillatory rotation 
of one of the dies to apply an oscillatory rotary shearing

force to a sample of material in the cavity, means for
measuring a torque which is indicative of the response of

the sample to the shearing force, and means for limiting the
maximum size of the said gap (62), 
characterised in that
 the
dies (33, 51) have the form of a flanged, closed end

cylinder on at least one of the dies, the flanged portion
having several radial passageways (52) from the inner edge

to the outer edge of the flange which permit the passage of
a cooling fluid from an inlet end at the inner edge to an

outlet end at the outer edge of the flange, the
cross-section of the outlet end being greater than the

cross-section of the inlet end of each passageway.
Apparatus according to claim 6 in which the
oscillatory rotating die (51) having an exterior face

adapted to cooperate with a corresponding face of the
opposing die (33) to mould and hold the sample, and the

passageways (52) are passageways through the cylindrical
body.
Apparatus according to either of claims 6
and 7 in which the oscillatory rotating die (51) has an

integral annular flange (36') surrounding the open end of
the cylindrical body, and the passageways (52) extend

through the cylinder body and through the flange (36').
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the
die (51) through which the oscillatory rotary shearing force

is applied to the sample is mounted at one end of a drive
shaft (6), and the compensation means acts through the said

drive shaft (6).
