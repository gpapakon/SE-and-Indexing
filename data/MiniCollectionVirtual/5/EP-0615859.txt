<ABSTRACT>
A thermosensitive recording material having an 
enhanced color-developing property and a high persistency 

of the resultant colored images formed thereon, is 
provided with a thermosensitive colored image-forming 

layer formed on a substrate sheet and comprising a 
substantially colorless dye precursor and a color 

developing agent comprising at least one aromatic 
compound of the formulae (I) and (II): 


wherein X and Y are an oxygen or sulfur atom, R¹ is an 
alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group or a hetero 

atom-containing alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkenyl group having 
at least one hetero atom included in a backbone group 

thereof, R² is an aryl or aralkyl group or a substituted 
aralkyl group having at least one hetero atom 

substituent, R³ is an unsubstituted aralkyl group or 
substituted aralkyl group having at least one hetero atom 

substituted in an aliphatic hydrocarbon group thereof, 
and R⁴ is an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl group, 

unsubstituted aralkyl group, aryl group, substituted 
alkyl group, or substituted aralkyl group having at least 

one hetero atom substituted in an aliphatic hydrocarbon 
group thereof, an aromatic hydrocarbon ring group 

included in each of the groups represented by R¹ to R⁴ 
optionally having at least one substituent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
thermosensitive recording material on which colored
images are formed by heating. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a thermosensitive recording
material capable of forming thereon colored images
resistant to fading and thus exhibiting a high degree of
persistency during extended storage thereof.The thermosensitive recording material of the
present invention has a high whiteness and is capable of
recording thereon colored images exhibiting an excellent
resistance to moisture, heat, oily and fatty substances,
and plasticizers, and thus has superior persistency when
stored over a long period of time, and therefore is
useful as colored image-recording sheets, sheets for use
in facsimiles, word processors, CRT image printers and
cash dispensers, as passenger tickets, commuter passes,
labels such as POS labels, cards such as prepaid cards,
and as transit passes.It is known that a conventional thermosensitive
recording material comprises a supporting substrate, for
example, a paper sheet, synthetic paper sheet, or plastic
resin film and a thermosensitive colored image-forming
layer formed on a surface of the supporting substrate and
comprising an electron-donative dye precursor, for
example, a leuco basic dye, an electron-acceptive color-developing
agent consisting of an organic acid substance,
for example, a phenolic compound, and a binder. When the
thermosensitive colored image-forming layer is heated
imagewise, colored images are recorded thereon by a
reaction of the dye precursor with the color-developing
agent. This type of thermosensitive recording material
is disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication
Nos. 43-4,160 and 45-14,039 and Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication No. 48-27,736, and is widely employed
in practice.Namely, the thermosensitive recording material
is advantageous in that colored images can be easily
formed by heating alone, and the recording apparatus can
be made compact and small in size, has a relatively low
price, and can be easily maintained. Therefore, this
type of thermosensitive recording material is appreciated
as a useful information-recording material for recording
outputs of printers used with, for example, computers,
facsimile machines, automatic ticket-vending machines,
scientific measurement recorders, and CRT medical
measurement recorders.Nevertheless, the conventional dye-forming type
thermosensitive recording materials in which the
thermosensitive colored image-forming layer comprises a
