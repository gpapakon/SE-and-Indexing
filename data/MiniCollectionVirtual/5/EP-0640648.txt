<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyolefin compositions. More 
particularly, this invention relates to polyolefin 
compositions having improved coating adhesion, processability, 
shrinkage and impact resistance at low temperatures. Polypropylene-based resins have high stiffness, heat 
resistance and processability. However, in applications which 
require high impact resistance, low temperature performance, 
dimensional stability and paintability, such as automotive 
parts and domestic appliances, polypropylene-based resins fall 
short. Therefore, attempts have been made to improve the 
above short comings of polypropylene-based resins, for 
example, adding copolymers of ethylene with alpha-olefins. U.S. 5,001,182 describes a resin composition comprising 
a crystalline propylene-ethylene block copolymer, which 
contains a propylene polymer component, a propylene-ethylene 
copolymer component and an ethylene copolymer component; (b) 
a non-crystalline ethylene-C3-6 alpha-olefin random copolymer 
component; and (c) a talc or calcium carbonate component. In EP 0 519 725 disclosed is a thermoplastic polymer 
composition comprising a thermoplastic polymer component 
comprising an ethylene-propylene rubber, and ethylene 
copolymer and a propylene polymer, which is blended with talc. 
A similar composition is disclosed in EP 0 496 625. Accordingly, this invention provides a polyolefin 
composition having improved paintability at high flexural 
modulus, low shrinkage, lower coefficient of linear thermal 
expansion, higher gloss and improved processability comprising 
(A) a crystalline propylene homopolymer or a crystalline 
copolymer of propylene and ethylene or a C4-8 alpha-olefin, (B)  
 
an olefin polymer composition, and optionally either, (C) a 
propylene polymer composition or (D) an olefin polymer rubber. All parts and percentages used in this application are by 
weight unless otherwise specified. Ambient or room 
temperature is approximately 25°C. The polyolefin composition of the present invention 
comprises: 
I. (A) from 10 to 80%, preferably 10 to 70% and most 
preferably 30 to 60%, by weight, of a crystalline 
propylene homopolymer or of a crystalline copolymer 
of propylene and ethylene or a C4-8 alpha-olefin and 
(B) from 10 to 80%, preferably 10 to 70%, and most 
preferably 30 to 60%, by weight of an olefin 
polymer composition; or II. (A) from 10 to 80%, preferably 10 to 70%, and most 
preferably 30 to 60%, by weight, of a crystalline 
propylene homopolymer or of a crystalline copolymer 
of propylene
