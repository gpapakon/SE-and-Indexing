<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating a site of systemic infection which includes administering a therapeutic compound entrapped in liposomes. Also included is a liposomal composition and a method of preparing a liposomal composition for use in concentrating a therapeutic compound to an infected region via the bloodstream. The liposomes, which contain the agent in entrapped form, are composed of vesicle-forming lipids, a vesicle-forming lipid derivatized with hydrophilic biocompatible polymer, and have sizes in a selected size range between 0.07 and 0.2 microns. After parenteral administration, the liposomes are selectively taken up by the infected region within 24-48 hours, for release of entrapped compound into the infected region.

<CLAIMS>
The use of a liposomal composition (i) 
composed of vesicle-forming lipids including an 

amphipathic vesicle-forming lipid derivatised with a 
hydrophilic biocompatible polymer of a size and in a 

molar amount effective to extend liposome blood 
circulation time, measured 24 hours after 

injection, of the liposome composition 
severalfold over that achievable in the 

absence of the hydrophilic polymer, (ii) having a 
selected mean particle diameter in the size range 

less than 
0.20 microns, and (iii) 

containing in liposome-entrapped form, a therapeutic 
compound effective against the source of the 

infection, for the manufacture of a medicament for use 
in treating a systemic infection which is localized at 

a site other than the fixed macrophages residing in 
the liver or the spleen.  

 
The use according to claim 1, wherein the 
hydrophilic biocompatible polymer is selected from 

polyethylene glycol , polyglycolic acid (PGA), 
polylactic acid (PLA), a copolymer of PGA and PLA and 

polyvinyl alcohol. 
The use according to claim 2, wherein the  
 

hydrophilic biocompatible polymer is a polyethylene 
glycol having a molecular weight between about 300 and 

5,000 daltons. 
The use according to any one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the infection is bacterial in origin and 

the therapeutic compound is an antibiotic. 
The use according to claim 4, wherein at 
least about 60% of the antibiotic is in liposome-entrapped 

form. 
The use according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
wherein the antibiotic is an aminoglycoside, the 

concentration of which entrapped in the liposomes is 
greater than 20 µg compound/µ-mole liposome lipid. 
The use according to any one of claims 4 to 
6, wherein the infection site is lung, the source of 

the infection is 
Klebsiella
, and the therapeutic agent 
is gentamicin.
