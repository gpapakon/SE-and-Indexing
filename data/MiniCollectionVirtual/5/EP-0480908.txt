<ABSTRACT>
A relay, having a magnet system consisting of a yoke and an armature, in which the armature is supported on the yoke, and having a coil, the armature and the yoke engaging by means of a limb into the coil. In the case of such a relay, in order to find the extension with as few air gaps as possible, it is provided that the armature (7) is constructed in an L-shape and is supported by means of its shorter limb (8) on the longer limb (4), which runs on the outside of the coil (2), of the U-shaped yoke (1), which is of integral construction, the shorter limb (3) of the yoke (1) engaging in the interior of the coil (2).

Relay having a magnet system comprising a yoke 
(1) and an armature (7), in which the armature (7) is 

mounted on the yoke (1), and a coil (2), the armature (7) 
and the yoke (1) engaging with a limb into the coil, the 

armature (7) being of L-shaped design and being mounted 
with its shorter limb (8) on that limb (4) of the U-shaped, 

integrally designed yoke (1) which is longer and 
runs at the outside of the coil (2), and the shorter limb 

(3) of the yoke (1) engaging into the interior of the 
coil (2), characterized in that the longer limb (9) of 

the armature (7) is designed as a lever with two arms by 
supporting on the inside wall of the coil (2) or, respectively, 

of the coil body. 
Relay according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the armature (7) is mounted on the yoke (1) with the edge 

(10) facing away from the end face (6) of the coil (2). 
Relay according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the armature (7) is mounted on the yoke (1) with an 

end face (25), of convex design, of its shorter limb (8). 
Relay according to Claim 1 or 3, characterized in 
that the armature (7) engages with its shorter limb (8) 

into a recess (23) of the limb (4) running on the outside 
of the coil (2). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the armature (7) is mounted with its 

shorter limb (8) in walls of a housing, projections (11), 
which engage into recesses (12) of the walls of a housing 

(13), laterally protruding from the shorter limb (8) of 
the armature (7). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that the shorter limb (8) of the armature 

(7) has a width which is at least equal to the width 
of that limb (4) of the yoke (1) which runs on the 

outside of the coil (2), the width of this limb (4) of 
the yoke (1) being greater than the width of that limb 

(9) of the armature (7) which engages into the interior 
of the coil (2). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the armature (7) is pressed against the 

limb (4) of the yoke (1) with its shorter limb (8) by 
means of a spring (24) which acts on the armature (7) and 

on that limb (4) of the yoke (1) which is positioned on 
the outside of the coil (2). 
Relay according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the spring is designed as a leaf spring (24) which is 

bent in a U-shaped manner and engages, at least partly, 
around the longer limb (4) of the yoke (1) and the 

shorter limb (8) of the armature (7).
