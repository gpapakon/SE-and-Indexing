<ABSTRACT>
Diskette liner (10, 11) with reduced tendency to have 

debris at cut edges because perimeter impregnated with 
polymer binder to bind loose fibers. Binder applied by 

flexographic printing process to fabric web.
 

Advantages: binder applied only as diskette liner 
perimeter pattern where it is cut from a larger web, so 

that the part which wipes the diskette is not made 
stiff; and the polymer binders work on rayon and other 

fabrics which are not thermoplastic (and thus not as 
amenable to thermal bonding).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of magnetic 
recording diskettes, more specifically to diskettes 
having a jacket or shell lined with material for 
cleaning or wiping the magnetic recording surface. Magnetic recording diskettes, particularly in the 
nominal 3.511 size, are commonly used for word 
processing and personal computer applications where 
relatively inexpensive, random access data storage is 
desired. These diskettes generally comprise a flexible disk 
of magnetic recording material with a central hub, 
substantially enclosed in a plastic shell. The shell, 
comprising two opposing halves joined together, has a 
circular opening to accommodate the diskette hub and a 
rectangular head access window. The shell is designed 
to protect the magnetic recording surface from exposure 
to contaminants such as dust, smoke, hair and 
fingerprints which can disrupt the operation of the 
head. Some contaminants manage to enter the shell 
through the aforementioned openings. For this reason, 
a diskette liner can be adhered inside each half of the 
shell by means known to the art in order to wipe the 
disk surface as it rotates. The liner is typically a 
soft nonwoven fabric piece cut to fit inside the shell 
and allow head access to the recording medium. An 
effective liner must have the ability to clean the disk 
surface (remove and hold stray particles and 
contaminants) while not causing scratching or excessive  
 
wear to the disk over millions of revolutions in the 
drive. Equally important, the liner should not itself 
be a source of debris and thus contribute to the 
possibility of signal error or loss of data. A number of methods for forming diskette liners 
are known. Liners may be made from nonwoven fibers 
bonded together with an adhesive binder. Such liners 
typically contain between 20-50% by weight of binder to 
maintain fabric integrity. In another chemical bonding 
approach, U.S. Patent 5,060,105 describes a diskette 
liner formed of a web impregnated with a relatively low 
concentration of polymeric binder. The binder is 
evenly distributed throughout the web. Binders can 
stiffen the fabric and cause abrasion of the magnetic 
layer of a diskette. Liners are cut from nonwoven web to the correct 
shape for installing in a diskette jacket or shell. A 
significant number of loose fibers, or stringers, can 
be generated at the cut edge of the liner. Once the 
liner is inside the assembled diskette, the loose 
fibers can detach from the liner and migrate to the 
magnetic recording surface.

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a diskette liner 
comprising the steps of: 


A. applying a binder polymer liquid to a fabric 
web in an outline pattern which corresponds to the 

perimeter of the diskette liner; 
B. drying the binder on the web; 
C. cutting the dry web into a shape suitable for 
use as a diskette liner, such that the cut edges of the 

fabric lie at least partly within the outline pattern. 
The method of claim 1 wherein step A is 
performed by means of a flexographic printing process 

in which the binder is printed on the fabric web by 
conta
cting the web with a polymeric printing plate 
having raised image areas corresponding to the outline 

pattern. 
The method of claim 2 wherein the image areas 
of the polymeric printing plate have a multiplicity of 

grooves of sufficient depth and in sufficient number to 
improve transfer of the liquid polymer binder to the 

fabric web over such transfer in the absence of such 
grooves. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the image areas 
of the polymeric printing plate have a multiplicity of 

grooves about 0.1 - 1.0 mm deep and at a spacing of 
about 6 - 14 grooves per centimeter. 
A diskette liner for use in cleaning a 
magnetic recording medium surface comprising a fabric 

web having incorporated therein a binder material in an 
outline pattern, said pattern corresponding, at least 

in part, to the perimeter of the diskette liner, the 
binder being present in sufficient quantity to reduce 

 
generation of loose fibers from cut edges of the liner 

by comparison to such a liner without such a binder in 
a pattern, provided that the cut edges are at least 

partly within the outline pattern. 
The diskette liner of claim 5 wherein the 
binder material is a polymer, useful in binding fibers 

together, and selected from the group consisting of 
vinyl acetate polymers, acrylic polymers, vinyl 

chloride polymers, nitrile rubbers, styrene butadiene 
copolymers, and polyvinyl alcohol. 
The diskette liner of claim 5 or 6 in which the 
fabric is a non-woven fabric. 
The dinette liner of any of claims 5 to 7 wherein the 
fabric is made of a fiber material selected from the 

group consisting of: rayon, acrylic, polyester, nylon, 
polypropylene, cotton, wool, and combinations thereof. 
A fabric web on which is imprinted a 
plurality of outline patterns, which comprise polymer 

binder, on the fabric web in sufficient quantity to 
reduce generation of loose fibers from cut edges of the 

fabric web by comparison to such a fabric web without 
such a binder imprinted thereon, provided that the cut 

edges are at least partly within the outline pattern. 
The fabric web of claim 9 wherein the outline 
pattern corresponds, at least in part, to the perimeter 

of a diskette liner.
