<ABSTRACT>
A method for dispersing a pigment is disclosed, 
wherein the pigment is dispersed in a medium solution by 

using sintered zirconia beads having an average particle 
diameter of 40 to 192 µm, a density of 5.9 g/cm³ or more, and 

a sphericity of 1.07 or smaller. The method is particularly 
useful for providing an excellent coating gloss when the 

medium solution is a binder for forming a paint or a coating 
composition or a binder for forming an ink composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
dispersing pigments using a ball mill, a pebble mill, a sand
mill; a high-speed agitating mill, a vibration mill, etc.Previously, the present inventors proposed a method
for dispersing a pigment in a medium solution (vehicle),
characterized in that a sintered zirconia ball having an
average particle diameter of about 200 to 350 µm, preferably
in the vicinity of 250 µm is used in the dispersing step
using a ball mill, a pebble mill or a sand mill, as disclosed
in JP-B-5-46248. (The term "JP-B" as used herein means an
"examined Japanese patent publication".)At this stage, however, it was never noticed that a
medium such as the sintered zirconia ball greatly affected on
the specular gloss degree on a coated surface of a paint
which was provided by using the medium.Furthermore, in order to obtain a Gs (60°) value of
100 or more as the surface gloss degree of the coating, it is
necessary to conduct at least seven or eight mill passes in
the production of a paint. Such a large number of steps
necessitates much operation time and thereby causes to
contaminate the surface and increases costs.EP-A-0 483 808 discloses a method for milling using an agitating mill. The
milling media may be formed from zirconia beads having an average particle
diameter of 0.1 mm and which have a density around 6.0 g/cm3. An object of the present invention is to provide a
novel method for dispersing a pigment which is capable of
remarkably increasing the surface gloss degree of a coated
surface of a paint obtained thereby while also minimizing the
number of mill passes.As a result of earnest studies on obtaining a coating
which is excellent in the surface gloss degree while
requiring only a small number of mill passes in a method for
dispersing a pigment in the production of a coating
composition, ink composition, etc., the present invention has
been completed.According to the present invention, there is provided
a method for dispersing a pigment comprising dispersing the
pigment in a medium solution by using zirconia beads having
an average particle diameter of 40 to 192 µm, a density of
5.9 g/cm3 or more; characterized in that the zirconia beads
are sintered zirconia beads having a sphericity of 1.07 or
smaller and an average particle diameter standard
deviation, y, represented by the following equation:
y ≤ -9.515x10-5x2 + 7.248x10-2x + 2.915
   where x is the average particle diameter of the
sintered zirconia beads in µm.In the present invention, the medium solution is
preferably
