<ABSTRACT>
To minimise the aerodynamic drag during the flight of a fin stablised 
sub caliber projectile and  thereby its velocity decay, the length of 

the section of threads (28) or group of grooves (22) arranged on the 
cylindrical body (10) for engaging a mating configuration on a 

discardable sabot (16,18,20) is limited. By locating the section of 
threads (28) or the group of grooves (22) aft of the point of natural 

transition (38,40) of the laminar boundary layer to turbulent boundary 
layer and adjacent the fin assembly (14), maximum benefit can be 

obtained from the low friction coefficient of the laminar boundary 
layer. A modified 60° STUB AMCE thread can be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an armor piercing, fin stabilized discarding sabot projectile 
according to the preamble of patent claim 1. While proceeding along their trajectory from gun to target, such projectiles experience a 
reduction in velocity due to the action of aerodynamic drag. Since terminal effectiveness of 
such kinetic energy ammunition, typically used as armor piercing ammunition, is in the first 
order a function of the impact velocity at the target, a reduction of the velocity decay during 
flight to the target is a powerful way to improve their performance, particularly at extended 
target ranges. A typical fin stabilized armor piercing projectile with its discarding  
 
sabot, for example, has been described in U.S. Patent 
4,901,646. Since the launched projectile is a subcaliber projectile, 
which implies that all its cross-sectional dimensions, 
including the span of the fins, are less than the bore diameter 
of the gun barrel, the projectile comprises a sabot; the latter 
is needed to support the subcaliber projectile during travel in 
the barrel. Upon exit from the muzzle of the barrel, the sabot is 
discarded and the subcaliber projectile is free to travel along 
its trajectory to the target. A subcaliber, fin stabilized, long rod projectile is comprised of 
a cylindrical columnar main body, having an essentially conical 
nose configuration at the front end and a stabilizing fin assembly 
attached to its rear. To achieve the desired performance the 
body of the projectile preferably consists of a high density, 
high strength alloy such as tungsten heavy metal or depleted 
uranium. Characteristically, the fin assembly consists of four or 
more fins systematically arranged around the main body of the 
subcaliber projectile. The finned subcaliber projectile is contained 
coaxially within the sabot, forming with the latter the 
projectile to be accelerated in the barrel of the gun and 
travelling along the axis of the gun barrel during launch. In 
addition to centering and radially supporting the subcaliber 
projectile, the sabot transmits the longitudinal acceleration 
caused by the gas pressure of the burning propellant to the 
subcaliber projectile. To allow this transmission, the subcaliber projectile 
and the sabot are provided with mating acceleration transfer 
interfaces, so that each of the generatrics of the main body 
comprise a plurality of grooves; to this end, the body is 
provided with a series of annular grooves which engage an 
equivalent mating section within
