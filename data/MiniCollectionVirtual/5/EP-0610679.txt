<ABSTRACT>
A number of embodiments of induction system for internal 
combustion engines employing multiple intake valves. The 

induction systems are designed so as to provide substantially 
unrestricted charging and axial flow into the cylinder bore 

when running under high-speed, high-load conditions. A 
control valve (68) is provided which changes the effective 

configuration of the induction passages so as to provide a 
slant tumble action under lower speed and load conditions. 

Various arrangements are disclosed for altering the amount of 
slant action and providing slant actions in opposite or the 

same direction. In addition, a single control valve element (68) 
is provided for achieving this effect in a three poppet valve 

per cylinder engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an induction system for an internal combustion engine
according to the preamble of claim 1 and more particularly to an improved
induction system that improves the performance of the engine at low and mid-range
conditions without deteriorating high-speed performance.As is well known, the induction system of an internal
combustion engine is extremely important in determining the
performance of the engine. Also, with conventional induction
systems, the induction system is designed so as to provide a
compromise between the requirements of high-speed and low-speed
performance. That is, to achieve maximum high-speed
performance, the induction system should be designed so as to
permit maximum charging of the cylinder. This can be
achieved by providing relatively large unrestricted flow
passages and in which the intake charge enters the cylinder
in a direction so as to flow generally parallel to the axis
of the cylinder bore.Although the described type of induction system provides
high power outputs, the unobstructed flow and large flow
areas tend to reduce the flow velocity entering the cylinder
when the engine is operated at low and mid-range speeds.
Under these conditions, it is desirable to have the flow
velocity entering the chamber to be more rapid and also to
introduce some turbulence so as to improve the flame
propagation and combustion. However, these turbulence
increasing devices can significantly reduce the breathing
ability of the engine and its high-speed performance.Therefore, conventional induction systems provide a
compromise between these two extremes with an emphasis on the
condition which is more frequently encountered.There have been proposed, however, a number of devices
for cooperation with the induction system so that it can
accommodate more readily the requirements of the engine at 
both high and low speeds as well as providing proper conditions during mid-range
performance, For example, in EP 0 500 124 Al there is disclosed an
arrangement for a four valve engine which includes a control valve that is
movable between an unrestricted position so as to provide maximum engine
charging and a flow redirecting position wherein different
types of flow patterns and different turbulence inducing
arrangements may be accomplished in the engine. That system
is extremely effective in improving the engine performance.In the various embodiments shown in that application,
there are constructions which are designed so as to provide,
in addition to normal, unrestricted charging,

<CLAIMS>
An induction system (29) for an internal combustion engine having a cylinder bore
(23) defining in part a combustion chamber, induction passage means for

delivering a charge to said combustion chamber, said induction passage means
being configured so that the charge introduced thereby into said combustion

chamber is generally unrestricted and flow is generally axially into said cylinder
bore (23), and control valve means (68) in said induction passage means and

movable between a first position wherein the flow of the charge into the
combustion chamber is generally unrestricted and in a generally axial direction

and a second position to redirect the flow into the combustion chamber in a
direction to generate a tumble flow with the charge flowing in a tumble motion

around an axis transverse to the axis of the cylinder bore
characterized in that
said induction passage means comprises a center intake passage (48) and two
side intake passages (46,47), each leading to an intake valve respectively, and

said control valve means (68) extends through the side intake passages (46,47)
and the center intake passage (48),
wherein the control valve means (68) protrudes further into the center intake
passage (48) than it does into the side intake passages (46,47),
whereby in said second position the tumble flow from said side intake passages is
stronger than that from the center intake passage, so that a slant tumble action in

opposite directions from opposite sides of the cylinder bore results.
Induction system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the intake
valves are poppet valves (52,53,54) for controlling the flow through the

intake ports.
Induction system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
intake ports are disposed at different distances from a plane containing 

the cylinder bore axis (x) and the axis of rotation of the output shaft of
the engine (21).
Induction system according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the control valve means (68) comprises a single control valve
element passing through the induction passage means (35).
Induction system according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
that
 the control valve means (68) is a generally cylindrical rotary valve.
Induction system according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
that
 the control valve means (68) is provided with cutouts (71,72,73) in
its cylindrical portion passing through the intake passage means for

redirecting the flow path when the control valve element is in its second
position.
Induction system according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in
that
 the side valve seats (42,43) are closer to a plane containing the
cylinder bore axis (x) than the center valve seat (44). 
Induction system according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
that
 one of the side valve seats
(42,43) generates a greater amount of tumble action than the other side

valve seat (43,42).
