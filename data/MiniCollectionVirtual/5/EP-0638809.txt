<ABSTRACT>
An analysis method and apparatus (20) comprises feeding a stream of fluid 
capsules (TP1) in a fluid conduit (134) for flow therethrough by forming a film of 

isolating liquid (IL) on an inner surface of the conduit and randomly accessing each of a 
plurality of liquids selected from a sample liquid (S1,SL,...), reagents (R1,R2,...) and a 

magnetic particle suspension to form 
a plurality of isolated segments from the plurality of liquids in each capsule in the 

conduit. The fluid capsules flow in at least one longitudinal direction of the conduit 
and the suspended magnetic particles are selectively magnetically retained from one 

segment in one capsule at a given location for placement of the magnetic particles 
in another segment in the one capsule during the flow of the one capsu
le through the 
conduit. The fluid capsules are then measured in the conduit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a capsule chemistry sample liquid analysis system and
method which, although suitable for application to a wide variety of analyses on a
wide variety of sample liquids, are particularly adapted to the automated clinical
analyses in turn of pluralities of human biological sample liquids.A large number of ligand binding assays, such as immunoassays and DNA probe
assays, are carried out on a solid phase. This allows separation of the target analyte
species from interfering species, reduction in background signal and measurements
of analytes in physiological specimens at very low concentration levels.In automated instruments, magnetic particles are the most desirable solid phase.
However, these automated instruments tend to be more complex because of the
additional mechanism required for the washing and separation of the magnetic
particles.US 4,141,687 discloses a method and apparatus for automatic assay of fluid samples,
particularly immunoassays, in which a reaction product of the assay is bound to a
magnetically attractable particle and separated from the reaction mixture by use of a
magnetic trap. M. Cassaday et al. "Capsule Chemistry Technology for High-Speed Clinical
Chemistry Analyses", Clin. Chem. 31/9, 1453-1456, 1985 disclose the encapsulation
of sequential micro-aliquots of sample and reagents within an inert fluorocarbon
liquid. The resulting test capsule is introduced into a single analytical flow path,
composed of fluorocarbon, where the sample is incubated, mixed, reacted, and
measured as a moving series of individual tests. The physical interaction between the
liquid an the solid fluorocarbon carrier materials effectively prevents detectable
carryover of aqueous constituents between successive test capsules.The main object of the present invention is to provide for the washing and separation
of the magnetic particles in an automated instrument.Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple structure for an
automated instrument for magnetic particle-based assays which has built-in wash
cycles which require no additional mechanisms and hardware.These and other objects of the present invention are 
achieved in accordance with the present invention by adapting
the magnetic particle-based assays to capsule chemistry
technology.The above and other significant objects and
advantages of the sample liquid analysis system and method of
our invention are believed made clear by the following
detailed description thereof taken in conjunction with the
accompanying
