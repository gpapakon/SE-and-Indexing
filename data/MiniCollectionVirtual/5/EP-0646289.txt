<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit arrangement comprising a pair of insulated-gate transistor devices connectible in series, the first transistor of said pair being operable as a depletion-mode device whilst the second transistor of said pair serves as an enhancement-mode device. A separately-biasable gate electrode permits the threshold voltage of the depletion-mode transistor to be adjusted independently.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor devices and, in particular, to the fabrication
of thin film transistors and integrated circuits incorporating such transistors.In designing circuits for integrated electronics it is an advantage to have more than
one type of active device available - for example CMOS has n and p channel and most
n-MOS integrated circuit fabrication processes allow selective variation of threshold
voltage and in particular fabrication of enhancement and depletion mode devices
simultaneously. For an n-channel enhancement mode device the minimum current (off
state) flows with zero applied gate voltage and is increased by applying a positive gate
voltage (on state). Conversely for a depletion mode device a negative gate voltage is
applied to turn the device off whilst at zero gate voltage the device is in the on state.In n-MOS circuits use of enhancement-depletion circuitry gives improved
performance when compared with enhancement-only circuits, in terms of switching speed,
output voltage levels, and power consumption.As indicated above, improved circuit performance is possible if depletion mode
devices are also available. Possible ways to produce depletion type thin film active devices
are to increase the semiconductor film thickness for the depletion devices as compared to
the enhancement, or to selectively add n-type dopant material into the channel region of the
depletion devices. In either case additional process steps would be needed, involving the
use of extra mask layers, and hence increased cost and reduced yield. Such devices are
shown in Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 57180177 and 3066159 and in US Patent
4803530. Depletion and enhancement devices may also be produced by using different
geometries for the CdSe layers without an additional mask step.We have devised a process using cadmium selenide which produces a double gated
n-channel enhancement mode device, combining the desirable characteristics of high speed
operation due to the high carrier mobility, high on current and low off current.It has been found possible to produce depletion-mode TFTs without any additional
processing steps by biasing one of the gates of the device to control the threshold voltage
of the device so that it has a suitable (negative) value. Thus the TFTs can be made to be
enhancement or depletion types as required, with both types co-existing in the same circuit. No alterations to the fabrication process are needed, and no additional mask layers,
merely a small variation in mask design to
