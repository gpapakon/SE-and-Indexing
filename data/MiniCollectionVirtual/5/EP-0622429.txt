<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-based ink with
which recording can be made on not only coated paper, but
also on non-coated paper generally used in offices and
homes, i.e., so-called plain paper, at high printing density
and quality. This invention further relates to an ink jet
recording method using the ink, as well as equipment using
the ink.An ink jet recording technique is advantageous in that
less noise is generated during recording, and recording
images of high resolution are obtained at a high speed by
using heads with a high degree of integration. Such an ink
jet recording technique employs, as a recording liquid, ink
that is prepared by dissolving various water-soluble dyes in
water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent. However,
the use of water-soluble dyes often causes a problem in
light resistance of recorded images because the water-soluble
dyes are inherently poor in light resistance. Owing to the fact that ink is water-soluble, there also
occurs a problem in water resistance of recorded images. In
other words, if recorded images are moistened with rain,
sweat or drinking water, they are likely to blur or disappear.Meanwhile, because of similar problems with respect to
stationery usages involving such needs as ball pens employing
dyes, various types of water pigment inks for stationery
have been proposed with a view to solving the problems of
resistance against light and water. From the standpoint of
using water pigment inks, proposals for achieving dispersion
stability, preventing ink from solidifying at ball points,
and preventing abrasion of balls used in ball pens are
discussed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 58-80368,
No. 61-247774, No. 61-272278, No. 62-568, No. 62-101671, No.
62-101672, No. 1-249869, and No. 1-301760. Recently, ball
pens, markers and the like using water-based pigment inks
have been sold on the market. As ink jet recording ink
using water pigment ink, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 56-147859,
No. 56-147860, etc. propose ink using a particular
water-soluble solvent and a high-molecular dispersant.
Further, ink using both a pigment and a dye is proposed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-57859, No. 4-57860, etc.However, conventional water-based pigment ink has a
disadvantage in that printing quality and density are remarkably 
deteriorated depending on the types of paper used,
especially when recording is made on plain paper (such as
copying paper and bond paper widely used in offices). In
general, since the surface condition of plain paper is
