<ABSTRACT>
There is described a barrier, especially for stadium stands and halls in which events are staged, comprising a barrier arrangement (10) which has at least two substantially vertically running brace elements (11a, 11b) which can be anchored by their bottom end (11a', 11b') in a foundation (2) and which are connected in their upper region by at least one cross-brace element (12, 12a). According to the invention, provision is made for a seat arrangement (20) having at least one seat (20') to be receivable in the barrier arrangement (10), for the seat (20') to be pivotable from a first position in which it is disposed substantially orthogonally to a plane defined by the brace elements (11a, 11b, 12) of the barrier arrangement (10), into a second position in which the seat (20') is disposed substantially in the plane defined by the strut elements (11a, 11b, 12) of the barrier arrangement (10), and for the seat (20') to be lockable in this second position by a latching device (14).

A barrier structure for stadium grandstands and event
halls, with a barrier device (10), which has at least two

essentially vertically extending strut elements (11a, 11b), which
can be anchored in a base (2) with their lower end (11a', 11b'),

and which are connected in their upper area by at least one
transverse strut element (12), and with a seating device (20)

received in the barrier device (10), which has at least one seat
(20'), which can be pivoted from a first position, in which it is

essentially disposed orthogonally in respect to a plane defined in
the
 barrier device (10) by the strut elements (11a, 11b, 12), into
a second position, in which the seat (20') is essentially disposed

in a plane defined in the barrier device (10) by the strut
elements (11a, 11b, 12), and can be arrested in this second

position against an unintended or impermissible actuation by means
of a locking device (14), characterized in that the seat (20') of

the seating device (20) has a pivot shaft (21) disposed in the
area of its rear edge (20b), which is pivotably seated in bearings

(14a, 14b) of the vertically extending strut elements (11a, 11b)
of the barrier device (10).
The barrier structure in accordance with claim 1,
characterized in that the locking device (14), which arrests the

seat (20') in its second position in the barrier device (10), has
a bolt (18), which is acted upon by a spring (17), and that the

seat (20') has a detent depression (16), which cooperates with the
bolt (18) of the locking device (14).
The barrier structure in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the spring (17) of the locking device (14)

is dimensioned in such a way that the unlocking of the seat (20') 
by moving back the bolt (18), on which the spring (17) acts, is

only possible by employing auxiliary means.
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the seating device (20) has a

further transverse strut element (12a), which acts as a backrest.
The barrier structure in accordance with claim 4,
characterized in that the locking device (14) is arranged on the

further transverse strut element (12a).
The barrier structure in accordance with claim 4,
characterized in that the distance between the pivot shaft (21)

and the front edge (20a) of the seat (20') is less than the
distance between the pivot shaft (21) and the lower edge (12a') of

the further transverse strut element (12a).
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 6, characterized in that the barrier device (10) has a detent

element (19), which limits the pivot movement of the seat (20').
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 7, characterized in that the seat (20') can be supported by

cables (23a, 23b) or chains acting on the barrier device (10).
The barrier structure in accordance with claim 1,
characterized in that the seating device (20) has more than one

seat (20').
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 9, characterized in that the barrier device (10) has 

connecting elements (24) for connecting it with at least one
further barrier device (10).
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 10, characterized in that the seat (20') of the seating

device (20) is made of wood, plywood, metal or plastic.
The barrier structure in accordance with claim 11,
characterized in that the seat (20') is provided with a frame and

has a plate inserted therein as the seating surface.
The barrier structure in accordance with one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the thickness of the seat

(20') is equal to or preferably less than the corresponding size
of the cross section of the longitudinal strut elements (11a,

11b).
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 13, characterized by its employment in a stadium or a hall.
The barrier structure in accordance with one of claims
1 to 14, characterized by its employment as a seating element.
