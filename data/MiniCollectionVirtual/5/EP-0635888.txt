<ABSTRACT>
A power MOSFET is created from a semiconductor body 
(2000 and 2001) having a main active area and a peripheral 

termination area. A first insulating layer (2002) of 
substantially uniform thickness lies over the active and 

termination areas. A main polycrystalline portion 
(2003A/2003B) lies over the first insulating layer largely 

above the active area. First and second peripheral 
polycrystalline segments (2003C1 and 2003C2) lie over the 

first insulating layer above the termination area. 
A gate electrode (2016) contacts the main 
polycrystalline portion. A source electrode (2015A/2015B) 

contacts the active area, the termination area, and the 
first polycrystalline segment. An optional additional 

metal portion (2019) contacts the second polycrystalline 
segment. 
The MOSFET is typically created by a five-mask 
process. A defreckle etch is performed subsequent to 

metal deposition and patterning to define the two 
peripheral polycrystalline segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the structure and fabrication of semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to power MOSFETs and associated termination structures.Power MOSFET devices are employed in applications such as automobile electrical systems, power supplies, and power management applications. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical structure for an N-channel power MOSFET. An N-epitaxial silicon layer 1 formed over an N+ silicon substrate 2 contains deep P+ regions 3 and 4, P body regions 5 and 6, and N+ source regions 7 and 8 for two MOSFET cells in the device. A continuous source-body electrode 12 extends across certain surface portions of epitaxial layer 1.The N-type drain for both cells is formed by the portion of N- epitaxial layer 1 extending to the upper semiconductor surface in Fig. 1. A drain electrode (not separately shown) is provided at the bottom of N+ substrate 2. An insulated gate structure comprising gate oxide 16 and gate polysilicon 18 lies over the channel and drain portions of the body.Many different processes have been used to fabricate power MOSFET devices. These fabrication processes generally employ deep diffusion. For example, in a process disclosed in Lidlow et al, UK Patent Publication 2,033,658A, a deep P-type region is about 4 µm deep, and a P-type body region is about 3 µm deep.A commercially available power MOSFET is the SMP60N05 product made by Siliconix, Inc. The SMP60N05 device has a specific on-resistance of 3.5 milliohms/cm2. The technology used to fabricate the SMP60N05 product typically achieves junction depths of 2.5-5.0 µm for the P body region, 5.0-6.0 µm for the P+ body contact zone, and 0.5-1.0 µm for the N+ source regions.A further MOSFET and its process of manufacturing are disclosed in EP492991.The present invention as claimed in claims 1, 17 and 26 furnishes a unique termination structure for a power MOSFET created from a monocrystalline semiconductor body divided into a main active area and a peripheral termination area.In a first aspect of the invention, a first insulating layer of substantially uniform thickness overlies the active and termination areas. The thickness of the first insulating layer preferably is 100-1000 angstroms (1µm=104Å). The first insulating layer constitutes the gate dielectric for the power MOSFET.A peripheral polycrystalline semiconductor segment is situated over the first insulating layer above the termination area. A second insulating layer overlies the peripheral polycrystalline segment. A source electrode for the MOSFET contacts the
