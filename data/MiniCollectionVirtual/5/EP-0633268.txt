<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provide a gene present in a 
commonly deleted region of a chromosome in breast and 

ovarian cancers and encoding a novel protein, the 
protein ("MDC protein") encoded by the gene, a method 

for the diagnosis of cancer by using an antibody 
combinable to the protein, and others. 
A detailed genetic map of human chromosome 17 was 
constructed to analyze the chromosome in breast and 

ovarian cancer tissues, and a gene encoding a novel 
protein was cloned and its structure was determined. 

As a result of gene analysis using DNA probes derived 
from the gene, a gene mutation was confirmed in breast 

cancer tissues. Moreover, a transformant carrying a 
plasmid containing the gene was grown to obtain the 

MDC protein. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody was 
prepared by using the protein as antig

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to MDC proteins,
DNAs encoding the same, and gene analysis methods
using the DNAs. The present invention can be utilized
in such fields as medical treatment and diagnosis.The opinion that mutations in cellular proteins
play an important role in the onset of cancer has been
known for long. Recent advancement in genetic
engineering enables analysis of gene mutations in
tumor cells, and has brought about a marked progress
in the field of cancer research.Up to this time, the analysis and identification
of oncogenes have made such progress that the number
thereof has amounted to several tens. On the other
hand, attention has been focused on tumor suppressor
genes for these several years. The tumor suppressor
genes which have been discovered thus far include the
Rb gene for retinoblastoma (Friend, S.H. et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 9095, 1987), the p53 gene 
(Lane, D.P. et al., Nature, 278, 261, 1979) and the
APC gene (Kenneth, W.K. et al., Science, 253, 661,
1991) for colorectal tumor, the WT1 gene for Wilms'
tumor (Call, K.M. et al., Cell, 60, 509, 1990), and
the like. In the case of the p53 gene, some families
are known to be inheriting mutations in the gene
["Li-Fraumeni syndrome" (Makin, D. et al., Science,
250, 1233, 1990; Srivastava, S. et al., Nature, 348,
747, 1990)]. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly
clear that defects in multiple genes, and not in a
single gene, contribute to the progression of the
malignant phenotype of cancer, and it is believed that
there exist much more unidentified oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes. The discovery and elucidation of
them are expected by not only investigators and
clinicians, but also common people in all the world.Breast cancer is classified into hereditary
(familial) breast cancer and nonhereditary (sporadic)
breast cancer, and hereditary breast cancer is
classified into early-onset and late-onset diseases
according to the age of onset. It has been revealed
by linkage analyses that, at least early-onset
familial, breast cancer linked to a very small region
on chromosome 17 (Hall, J.M. et al., Science, 250,
1684-1689, 1990). Moreover, it has been shown that 
hereditary ovarian cancer is also linked to the same
region (Narod, S.A. et al., Lancet, 338, 82-83, 1991).Accordingly, it is believed that a tumor
suppressor gene is present in this region and protein
deficiency or mutation induced by an allelic deletion
or mutation of the gene is one of the causes of breast
and ovarian cancers.It is believed that in the onset
