<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of aqueous solutions and gels of chitosan in which chitosan and an acidic chelating agent are dissolved in water. Such solutions can be drastically increased in viscosity or converted into highly viscous gels by adding salts of polyvalent metals and acids in which chitosan is only moderately soluble or is insoluble. From such solutions, salt-like chitosan/chelating agent adducts can be obtained by removing water or by precipitation using an organic solvent.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing high-viscosity chitosan
gels, characterized in that salts of polyvalent metals

and acids in which chitosan is insoluble or only
moderately soluble are added to aqueous solutions

comprising chitosan and an acid chelating agent.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the carbonates, sulfates, phosphates or oxalates

of calcium or magnesium are added.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the salts are added to solutions which

comprise chitosan and chelating agents in a mass ratio
of from 1:0.3 to 1:5 in water at a total content of

from 0.1 to 25% by weight.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the chelating agent used is

nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, triethylenetetraaminehexaacetic

acid or diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic
acid.
Process for preparing salt-like adducts of
chitosan and chelating agents, characterized in that


a) a solution according to one or more of Claims 1 to
4 is prepared, and
b) the salt-like adducts of chitosan and chelating
agents are obtained from this solution by removal

of water

   or

   by precipitation using an organic solvent.
