<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an asynchronous machine having a squirrel-cage rotor which is borne by means of roller bearings such that it can rotate. Damage to the grease-lubricated bearings of the machine while the machine is starting in a temperature range below or around the freezing point is avoided in that a voltage is applied to the stator winding (1) of said machine, with the rotor (2) at the same time being blocked, before starting of the machine, as a function of the temperature prevailing on the machine, the magnitude of which voltage is such that a multiple of the machine rated current flows and such that, on reaching a specific temperature on predetermined machine parts or after the voltage has acted for a specific time, said voltage is turned off and the blocking of the rotor (2) is removed.
