<ABSTRACT>
A thermoelectric conversion member(1) formed of a 
thermoelectric conversion element has a split ring shaped 

transverse cross section. There are disposed electrodes(5,6) 
on ring ends of the thermoelectric conversion member(1) 

facing each other. A magnetic field generating unit(2) 
generates a magnetic field H in a direction perpendicular to 

the transverse cross-sectional plane of the thermoelectric 
converssion member(1). A heating unit(3) for heating one 

side of an annular wall of the thermoelectric conversion 
member(1) and a cooling unit(4) provided on the opposite 

side of the annular wall of the thermoelectric conversion 
member(1) produces a temperature gradient ▿T in a 

direction radially of the thermoelectric conversion 
member(1). 
 
Electric field is induced in the direction 
perpendicular to both directions of the magnetic field H and 

the temperature gradient ▿T, that is in the circumferential 
direction of the ring of the thermoelectric conversion 

member(1) under the Nernst effect, enabling an electric 
voltage to be taken out at the electrodes(5,6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoelectric power 
generating device and more particularly to a thermoelectric 
power generating device which generates electric power under 
the Nernst effect. If a metal piece or a n-type thermoelectric  
 
semiconductor piece having free electrons is heated at its 
one end, the electrons at a high-temperature side are 
increased in their kinetic energy and diffused towards the 
low-temperature side, such that the electron density at the 
high-temperature side and that at the low-temperature side 
are decreased and increased, respectively, as a result of 
which a potential difference is produced. In case of a p-type 
thermoelectric semiconductor having holes as carriers, 
a potential difference is generated in the reserve 
direction. This phenomena is called the Seebeck effect on which 
the principle of a thermoelectric generation is based. An 
voltage is taken to outside by combining p-type and n-type 
thermoelectric semiconductor. Referring to Fig. 7, a radio isotope thermoelectric 
power generator(RTG), as an example of a conventional 
thermoelectric generator is explained. In this connection, 
reference is also had to " Thermal Semiconductors and their 
Applications" by K. Uemura and I. Nishida, issued by NIKKAN 
KOGYO SHIMBUN-SHA, December 1988, page 127. Fig. 7 shows a schematic diagram of a conventional 
thermoelectric generator of a Π-type structure employing a 
radio isotope (RI) as a heat source. Referring to Fig. 7, an n-type thermoelectric 
material formed of an n-type semiconductor and a p-type  
 
thermoelectric material formed of a p-type semiconductor 
have their one ends connected to each other via a heat-collecting 
metal plate (p-n junction electrode) and have 
their other ends mounted with heat-radiating metal plates 
(low-temperature electrode). The heat-collecting metal plate 
is heated by the heat-source to a higher temperature. The 
heat transmitted from the heat-collecting metal plate to the 
low-temperature electrodes provided at the opposite ends of 
the p-type and n-type semiconductors is radiated via a heat 
radiator, not shown. The plus(+) electrode of the p-type 
thermoelectric material and the minus(-) electrode of the n-type 
thermoelectric material are connected to a constant 
voltage unit for outputting a constant voltage to outside. With the conventional thermoelectric generator, the 
thermoelectric semiconductor is evaluated by its figure of 
merit, or efficiency. The conventional thermoelectric 
generators suffer from a lower
