<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for the removal of tertiary 
butyl chloride from a hydrocarbon stream, wherein the 

hydrocarbon stream is contacted at a temperature of from 
about 130° to about 170°C with a particulate calcium 

oxide containing from 1 to 10 mole % of a Group 3 or 4 
compound and the hydrocarbon stream is recovered 

containing a reduced level of tertiary butyl chloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The manufacture of butyl rubber involves the 
polymerization, in methyl chloride, of a mixture of 
isobutylene and isoprene. The product from the reactor 
is sent to a flash tank where it is contacted with hot 
water and steam to vaporize the methyl chloride and 
unreacted isobutylene and isoprene all of which are 
recycled by passage through a drier and by distillation. 
During the process some tertiary butyl chloride is 
formed which remains with the isoprene from the 
distillation step. The recycled isoprene contains small 
amounts of tertiary butyl chloride and cannot be re-used 
in the polymerization process and is difficult to 
dispose of because of the presence of the tertiary butyl 
chloride. A number of techniques are known for the removal of 
halogenated organic compounds from hydrocarbons but so 
far no one procedure is satisfactory, technically and 
economically, for the removal of tertiary butyl chloride 
from isoprene so that the isoprene can be re-used in the 
polymerization process. Chemical Abstracts Vol. 30, 
25477 describes that when n-butyl chloride is heated 
with calcium oxide, butene is formed. The temperature 
initially is 275 to 285°C but after some calcium 
chloride has been formed the temperature can be reduced 
to 225°C. Chemical Abstracts Vol. 29, 28743 shows that 
compounds of formula CnH2n+1Cl yield the hydrocarbon 
CnH2n and hydrogen chloride when heated in the presence 
of catalysts such as aluminum oxide, thorium oxide and 
calcium chloride. U.S. Patent 2 920 122 describes 
addition of tertiary butyl chloride to a bed of calcium 
zeolite A which is then sealed and allowed to stand 
overnight following which, after removal of the excess  
 
tertiary butyl chloride, is heated to recover 
isobutylene. Chemical Abstracts Vol. 51, 15547 e 
describes the use of a heating element maintained at 
800° to 1100°C immersed in halogenated hydrocarbons 
causes removal of hydrogen chloride and shows that for 
tertiary butyl chloride 87% is converted to isobutylene. 
U.S. Patent 4 921 924 describes the removal of tertiary 
butyl chloride from an olefin monomer mixture by 
contacting the monomer mixture with alumina. U.S. 
Patent 3 864 243 teaches that hydrocarbons containing 
organically combined chlorine are treated by passage 
through high surface area, porous alumina to adsorb the 
chemically combined chlorine onto the alumina. I have discovered that unsaturated mono- and di-olefinic 
hydrocarbons containing tertiary butyl chloride 
as an impurity are purified by passage over
