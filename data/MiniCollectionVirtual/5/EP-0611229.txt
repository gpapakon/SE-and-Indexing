<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an improved flywheel 
for damping vibrations in a coating roll. The improved 

flywheel has an inner plate (50) and an outer plate (52) and 
sandwiched between the two plates are alternating rings (56) 

of a solid body material such as aluminum or steel and 
conventional vibration damping material (54). Typically, 

the flywheel is attached to the coating roll outside of 
the bearing mounting block. The flywheel is designed 

such that axial movement of the inner and outer plates 
relative to each other works to compress and expand the 

damping material sandwiched between the two plates (50,52). 
This compression and expansion of the damping material 

results in the absorption and dissipation of 
vibrational energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
which damps natural vibrations of a rotary shaft. In the coating process known as bead coating 
and described in U.S. patent 2,761,791, multiple liquid 
layers flow down a slide hopper and are deposited on a 
moving web supported by a coating roll. In this 
process, the hopper lip is in close proximity to the 
moving web. In the space between the hopper lip and 
the web, a liquid bridge is formed. This liquid bridge 
is extremely sensitive to spacing changes. Vibration 
of the coating roll dynamically changes the spacing 
between the coating roll and the hopper lip. These 
spacing changes in turn cause nonuniform coatings to be 
made. The vibration of the coating roll is routinely 
detected in the uniformity of products coated using the 
bead coating process. A flywheel attached to a coating roll has 
been found to provide assistance in maintaining a 
constant speed and a reduction in the largest vibration 
of the coating roll. It has also been shown that 
without a flywheel, a coating roll exhibits a single 
natural frequency mode. Installation of a standard 
flywheel creates two natural frequency modes which have 
lower amplitudes than the single natural frequency mode 
found without a flywheel. The addition of the flywheel 
does not increase the damping of the coating roll since 
the amplitude of the two smaller peaks is approximately 
equal to the amplitude of the single peak. It has also 
been shown that the relative heights of each peak can 
be adjusted by adding or removing weight to the  
 
flywheel, but their total amplitude always equals the 
amplitude of the single peak. The present invention is a device which damps the 
vibrational energy of a coating roll and thereby reduces 
the total vibrational amplitude of the coating roll. DE-U-72,19981 discloses an apparatus for damping 
vibrations relative to an axis but solves only in part, the 
above mentioned problems. The present invention is an apparatus for damping 
vibrations relative to an axis of a rotating or stationary 
member. The apparatus includes a first plate element, a 
second plate element, and a means for fixing the first and 
second plate elements to the rotating or stationary member 
at locations along and transverse to the axis of the 
rotating or stationary member. Relative rotation between 
the member and the first and second plate elements about 
the axis is prevented. At least one layer of damping 
material is captured between and contacts each of the first 
and second plate
