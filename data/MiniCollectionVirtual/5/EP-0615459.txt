<DESCRIPTION>
 VASOOCCLUSION COIL WITH ATTACHED FIBROUS ELEMENT (S)DescriptionTechnical Field This invention is in the field of vasoocclusion devices. More particularly it relates to a vasoocclusion coil to which fibrous elements are attached.Background Vasoocclusion devices are surgical implements that are placed within vessels, typically via a catheter to block the flow of blood through the vessel. One type of vasoocclusive device is a helical wire coil that has windings that are dimensioned to engage the walls of the vessels. Fibers are laid crosswise through the windings to provide a substrate for embolization within the vessel. Coils of such structure are available commercially from Cook, Inc.U.S. 4,994,069 describes a vasoocclusive coil that assumes a linear helical configuration when stretched and a folded convoluted configuration when relaxed. The stretched condition is used in placing the coil at the desired site and the coil assumes its relaxed configuration—which is better suited to occlude the vessel—once the device is so placed.A principal object of the present invention is to provide a helical vasoocclusion coil to which fibrous elements are attached in a manner that ensures they will not be dislodged from the coil and enhances the ability of the coil to facilitate embolization. 

 Disclosure of the InventionThe invention is a vasoocclusive device comprising:(a) a helical coil having a multiplicity of windings extending between a first end and a second end;(b) at least one fibrous element having a first end attached to one of said windings in the region of the first end of the coil, a second end attached to another of said windings in the region of the second end of the coil, with the portion of the element intermediate said ends extending axially along the coil in a generally serpentine configuration composed of a plurality of loops having maxima that extend radially outwardly and minima that extend radially inwardly and are threaded about individual windings at spaced intervals along the coil.Brief Description of the DrawingsFigs. 1 to 11 are fragmentary elevational views (not to scale) of embodiments of the helical coil of the invention. Figs. 1 and 2 show the specific manner of connecting the fibers to the coils.In the drawings, like structures are referred to by the same reference numeral.Modes for Carrying Out the InventionFig. 1 depicts one embodiment, generally designated 10, of the vasoocclusive coil of the invention. The device 10 has two components: a helical coil 11; and a fibrous element
