<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for automatically undertaking power reduction of a 
monitor in a computer system make use of the fact that, when the computer system is 

active, synchronization pulses will be transmitted to the monitor. In the method and 
apparatus herein, it is insured that when the computer system is inactive, transmission 

of those synchronization pulses ceases. Within the monitor, the reception of these 
synchronization pulses is detected, and in the absence of synchronization pulses, steps 

are taken to reduce the power consumption by the monitor. Power can be discontinued 
to different portions of the monitor as the length of time for which the synchronization 

pulses are absent increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for automatically 
turning off a computer monitor when its associated computer is temporarily not in use, 
and for automatically turning the monitor on when use of the computer is resumed. Computer systems generally consist of a computing unit 1 (which may have built-in 
storage devices like floppy disks, hard disks and tape drives), a keyboard 2 and a 
monitor 3, as schematically shown in Figure 1. The computing unit 1 may also be 
connected with a printer and other peripheral devices. These types of computing devices are often referred to as PC's (Personal 
Computers). Another type of computing system is shown in Figure 2, In this type of system a 
main computer 9 is connected to several terminals 10, such as by connection to the 
respective monitors 3, each with its own keyboard 2. The main computer 9 itself is 
typically more powerful than that of Figure 1 in order to handle the workload from the 
combined group of terminals/monitors. Several other configurations exist including a combination of Figures 1 and Figure 
2, where each terminal 10 in Figure 2 actually consists of a computing device as shown 
in Figure 1. This combination of centralized main unit and de-centralized 
PC-units is 
quickly gaining popularity among many data system users. All these systems draw energy, and in many cases, the monitor itself uses a 
significant amount of energy to run properly. Typically, these systems stay on during the 
entire workday, even when they are not in active use. This means waste of energy. For  
 
a company with, approximately 500 employees each with his or her own PC, this power 
waste may easily reach many kilowatts every day. Heretofore, this has been accepted, 
but it is to be expected that much stricter requirements are going to be put on power 
conservation in computer systems in the future. This will be done both to save cost and 
also to protect the environment. Although operators can be trained to turn the computer system off every time they 
leave their desk, most people will not find this practical. Therefore, system should be 
designed to perform this task automatically, and in a way which causes few, if any, 
problems or delays for the operator. In principle, automatically saving energy by turning off the computer system is fairly 
easy. Small portable computers (laptop computers) have had such features for several 
years. The computer itself is designed so that if there is no activity from the keyboard or 
from other external
