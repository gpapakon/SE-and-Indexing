<ABSTRACT>
A crosslinkable plastisol comprising (1) an epoxy 
group-containing vinyl chloride resin, (2) a triazine 

compound, (3) a plasticizer, and (4) an optional amino 
group- and/or thiol group-containing silane compound. The 

plastisol is capable of providing a shaped article or a 
laminated article, which has good heat distortion 

resistance, chemical resistance, resistance to whitening due 
to water, adhesion, transparency and thermal resistance on 

processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates a crosslinking vinyl chloride
resin plastisol. More particularly, it relates to a crosslinking
vinyl chloride resin plastisol used as a paste vinyl
chloride resin for shaped articles and laminated articles,
which have good heat distortion resistance, chemical
resistance, resistance to whitening due to water, adhesion
and thermal resistance on processing.Laminated articles having a laminate structure
comprised of a shaped article and a surface protective layer
of a vinyl chloride resin (said layer may be hereinafter
called as "top layer"), formed on the shaped article, have
heretofore been widely used, wherein the shaped articles
include, for example, (1) a shaped article made of a
synthetic resin such as a vinyl chloride resin or
polyurethane, (2) a steel plate or sheet, an aluminum foil,
a metal plate or sheet, plaster, a wooden article, or paper,
(3) a printed article having a printed image formed on a
substrate such as exemplified in the above (2), and (4) an
organic or inorganic fibrous or textile article.As typical examples of such laminated articles, there
can be mentioned floorings, (1) wall materials and
cushioning materials, which have a foamed substrate made of
a vinyl chloride resin or polyurethane, (2) a metal plate or
sheet having a surface protective or decorative layer, and
(3) flat articles which are comprised of a sheet-form
material made of nylon, a polyester resin, a glass fiber or
paper, and a surface coating of a vinyl chloride resin.The formation of a top layer on various shaped
articles is intended to give some physical and chemical
properties to the shaped articles, such as tenacity,
abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, resistance to
whitening due to water (i.e., resistance to whitening or 
loss of transparency due to water-absorption or moisture-absorption),
and flame retardancy, whereby the shaped
articles are protected to enhance the practical performance,
or a decorative effect is given to the shaped articles to
enhance the commercial value.Thus, a vinyl chloride resin is laminated on shaped
articles to obtain a protective or decorative effect.
However, a vinyl chloride resin is thermoplastic and is
incorporated with a plasticizer in view of hand and feeling
in the field of the above-listed laminated articles.
Therefore the vinyl chloride-coated articles have a problem
such that the softening point is low and the thermal
resistance is poor.To solve this problem, attempts have been made to
crosslink a vinyl chloride resin. A typical example of the
