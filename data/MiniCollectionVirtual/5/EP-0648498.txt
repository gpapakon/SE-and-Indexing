<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a physiologically 
active peptide composition and, more particularly, to a physiologically 
active peptide composition containing a 
physiologically active peptide such as a peptide hormone, 
a physiologically active protein or an enzymatic protein 
and having high stability in the form of a preparation 
and improved absorbability into the body, for example, 
when administered nasally. Physiologically active peptides such as calcitonin 
and insulin are polymers which are extensively employed 
in therapeutical treatment for various medical usage due 
to their specific physiological activity. These physiologically active peptides, however, 
can little be absorbed intact from the mucous membrane of 
the intestine because they are likely to be decomposed 
with proteases existing in the digestive system or are 
high in molecular weight and polarity. Hence, they cannot 
be administered orally and they can be administered only 
through injection. The injectable administration cannot 
be said to be preferable because the injection causes 
pain at the site of injection to patients. In addition, 
particularly, when the injection should be repeated at 
constant intervals, such pain is repeated whenever they 
are injected and it may often become too severe for 
patients to endure. Therefore, strong demand has been 
made to develop a method for administering the 
physiologically active peptide via a non-injection route 
and, more preferably, a method which enable patients to 
administer it by themselves, which further should be 
safe, simple in administration and administrable with 
less frequency.  As one of such methods for administering the physiologically 
active peptides, an aerosol in the form of a 
suspension, which uses a fluorinated hydrocarbon as a 
spouting agent, has been developed for nasally 
administering, for example, calcitonin. As another means 
for nasal administration, a spraying agent has been 
proposed as a nasally administrable liquid preparation, 
which is a preparation in which calcitonin is formulated 
with a surface-active agent as an absorption promoter. 
Furthermore, recently, there have been proposed some 
nasally administrable powdery preparations having 
improved absorbability, which are prepared by adsorbing 
calcitonin onto a polysaccharide such as cellulose. The 
various techniques for nasal administration, which have 
recently been actively developed, are said to be in 
principle superior as methods for administering such 
physiologically active
