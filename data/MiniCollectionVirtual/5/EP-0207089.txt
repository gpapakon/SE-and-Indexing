<ABSTRACT>
A device for exactly determining the colour of a dental prosthesis to be applied, or of the material to be used in dental pluggings, so as to make it perfectly identical to the colour of the patient's teeth. Comprising a light source (1), which sends light rays over a monochromator (2), which, by means of an optical switcher or chopper (3), separates the monochromatic light rays into at least two parallel circuits (4, 4a, 5, 5a), the one (4, 4a) including a housing or cell (6) for at least one of the patient's teeth (9), the other, (5, 5a), comprising a reference cell (7), which includes a white-coloured reference sample (28). Said circuits head up at a device (8) that detects and compares the rays coming from cell (7) and those that have passed through cell (6) and the tooth or teeth (9), providing a sequence of signals that are applied to a detector (8), which are then duly amplified and applied to a digital-analogical convertor (12), which is hooked up to a data processor or computer (10), which provides the coded identification data on the colour as identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
A SPECTRUM-PHOTOMETER DEVICE FOR EXACTLY DETERMINING THE COLOUR OF A DENTAL PLATE AND OF DENTAL PLUGGINGSThe invention concerns a spectrum-photometer device that can be used by dental medical doctors and by dental surgeons or by dental technicians working in dental laboratories to exactly determine the colour of one or more of the patient's teeth, so as to be able to obtain a dental prosthesis or dental fillings/identical in colour to the natural colour of the patient's teeth.Up until now this identification of the colour was done in a very approximative manner by placing in close proximity to the patient's teeth a support bearing a series of teeth of various colours and estimating, by eye, but with a very limited approximation to the actual colour, the colour of the prosthesis tooth or teeth being considered nearest to the colour of the natural teeth, either to make invisible dental fillings or to obtain a partial reconstruction of a natural tooth.This invention envisions a device for detecting, immediately and with the greatest precision, the colour of the patient's teeth, which device includes as its principal part a UV/VIS spectrum-photometer of any suitable kind, a device that in itself is already known, but that, according to this invention, is outfitted with special means whose purpose is the specific one 

indicated above.As is known, spectrum-photometers can detect the colour of an object or of a part of an object with extreme speed and" reliability, making no mistakes. The device comprises substantially a light source and means for obtaining a monochromatic pencil of rays that are made to pass through two parallel circuits. In one of these said two circuits there is a housing within which at least one tooth may be inserted, whose colour is to be measured, and in the other circuit a cell is inserted, which contains a reference white sample, from which an information signal is generated for making the comparison of the two colours picked up, with signals of the various UV/VIS wave lenghts. The two circuits channeling the beam of monochromatic rays that has crossed over the tooth and the one that has crossed over the sample contained in the reference cell, end up at a device that compares the two signals and provides, in code form, visual or printed information of the colour detected, after processing the input data.The invention envisions that the cell, assigned to housing the tooth or teeth being observed, be perfectly screened from the entrance of any possible external light, as well as from
