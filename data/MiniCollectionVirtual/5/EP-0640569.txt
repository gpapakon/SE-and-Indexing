<ABSTRACT>
This process consists in bending the glass sheet(s) in at least two stages, the first consisting in the action of gravity producing a blank of the definitive shape, and the last, producing the definitive shape, consisting of combined actions, simultaneous or otherwise, of gravity and of at least one additional mechanical force. The invention also proposes a device.

Process for bending on a frame (1) of at least one glass sheet (20),
during which the stacked glass sheet or sheets, placed on a bending frame

in a horizontal position, are raised to the deformation temperature and are
bent in at least two stages, the first consisting of the action of gravity

on the glass sheet or sheets, which are supported along a first peripheral
line and leading to a blank of the final shape, and the final stage leading

to the final shape of the glass sheet or sheets, which are supported along
a second peripheral line having a different curvature and which is substituted

for the first, characterized in that the final shape is reached
during the final stage by the simultaneous or non-simultaneous combination

of the actions of gravity and at least one additional mechanical force.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the additional
mechanical force is a pressure force.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the additional
mechanical force is a resistance force permitting a shaping of the glass

sheet (20).
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the first bending stage consists of producing at least one blank of the

transverse curvature.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
in the first bending stage bending essentially takes place according to the

transverse curvature and according to the longitudinal curvature located
for the latter in the median portion of the glass sheet or sheets (20) and

in that in the final stage the complimentary, essentially longitudinal
bending takes place, which is located on the peripheral portion of the

glass sheet or sheets.
Process according to claim 1 to 5, characterized in that the peripheral
lines are at least partly distinct from one another.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the substitution
relates to the lateral portions of the first line. 
Process according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that the substitution
consists of raising the level of at least one portion of the second

line.
Process according to one of the claims 5 to 8, characterized in that
the first peripheral line is such that the angle formed by any vector

tangential to said line with the horizontal plane is below 20° and preferably
below 15°.
Device for bending on a frame of at least one glass sheet (20) comprising
a frame (1), whereof at least one portion is duplicated so as to

permit two positions, the first leading to a shape blank and the second to
the final shape, characterized in that it comprises at least one shaping

part (8) used for the formation of the final shape, and means (5, 22, 23)
permitting a relative approach of the shaping part and the frame.
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that during the formation
of the final shape, at least one portion of the frame (1) moves in

the direction of at least one stationary shaping part (8).
Device according to one of the claims 10 or 11, characterized in that

at least the end, lateral portions of the frame (1) are duplicated.
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 12, characterized in that
the duplicated portion of the frame (1) extends over virtually the entire

periphery of the frame.
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 13, characterized in that
the duplicated portions of the frame (1) are implemented by pivoting

elements (4, 30) fixed to a blank frame and which can be substituted for
portions of said blank frame for the formation of the final shape.
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 14, characterized in that
the first position of the frame (1) is such that the angle formed by any

vector tangential to said frame with the horizontal plane is below 20°
and preferably below 15°. 
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 15, characterized in that
the second position of the frame (1) is such that the angle formed by a

vector tangential to the lateral end of the widest portion of the frame
and the horizontal plane exceeds 50°.
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 16, characterized in that
at least one shaping part (8) is such that an at least punctiform contact

is brought about with the glazing (20).
Device according to claim 17, characterized in that the contact between
the shaping part (8) and the glazing (20) is at least linear.
Device according to claim 18, characterized in that there is surface
contact between the shaping part (8) and the glazing (20).
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 19, characterized in that
