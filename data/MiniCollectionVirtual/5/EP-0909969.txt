<ABSTRACT>
A laser scanning optical system includes a light
source, a polygonal mirror for deflecting a light beam

emitted by the light source, and a scanning lens system
for guiding the light beam deflectively reflected by

the polygonal mirror to a surface to be scanned. The
scanning lens system has a spherical lens, and a toric

lens which is formed of a plastic material having a
positive refractive power in both main scanning and

sub-scanning directions. At least one surface of the
toric lens has an aspherical shape which is

substantially perpendicular to a light beam, which has
been transmitted through the spherical lens, in a main

scanning section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser scanning
optical system and an image forming apparatus using the
same and, more particularly, to a laser scanning
optical system suitable for an image forming apparatus
such as a laser beam printer (LBP), digital copying
machine, or the like, which has, e.g., an
electrophotography process for recording image
information by deflecting and reflecting a light beam
(laser beam) emitted by a light source means comprising
a semiconductor laser using a light deflector
comprising a rotary polygonal mirror (polygonal
mirror), and then scanning the light beam on the
surface to be scanned via a scanning lens system (f-
lens) having f- characteristics.Conventionally, for example, Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 3-231218 proposed a laser
scanning optical system, which periodically deflects a
light beam emitted by a light source means by a light
deflector comprising, e.g., a rotary polygonal mirror,
focusing the light beam into a spot shape on the
surface of a photosensitive recording medium 
(photosensitive drum) via a scanning lens system, and
scanning the light beam on that surface to record an
image. Figs. 1 and 2 are respectively a main scanning
sectional view and a sub-scanning sectional view of the
laser scanning optical system proposed by that
reference.In Figs. 1 and 2, a light beam (laser beam)
emitted by a light source means 101 comprising a
semiconductor laser is converted into a nearly
collimated light beam by a collimator lens 102, that
light beam (light amount) is limited by a stop 103, and
then enters a cylindrical lens 104 having a
predetermined refractive power in only the sub-scanning
section. The nearly collimated light beam that enters
the cylindrical lens 104 leaves the cylindrical lens
104 in fact in the main scanning section. However, in
the sub-scanning section, the nearly collimated light
beam converges and forms a nearly line image on a
deflection surface 105a of a light deflector 105
comprising a rotary polygonal mirror. The light beam
deflected and reflected by the deflection surface 105a
of the light deflector 105 is focused on the surface of
a photosensitive drum 108 as the surface to be scanned
via a scanning lens system (f- lens system) 111, which
is comprised of a spherical lens 106 having a positive
refractive power, and a toric lens (plastic toric lens)
107 formed of a plastic material having a positive 
refractive power in both the main scanning and
sub-scanning directions. By rotating the light
deflector 105 in the direction
