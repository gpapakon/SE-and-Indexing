Restraint system for tiltable backrests in motor vehicles, in particular passenger
vehicles, comprising a detachable, tear-resistant belt (2), which can be

tensioned and extends from the upper region (18) of the backrest (6) above the
loading space and/or the loading space cover to the vehicle rear and is

anchored there on the inner face of the tailgate (10).
Restraint system according to claim 1, characterised in that the belt (2) extends
inside the vertical vehicle longitudinal centre plane and/or parallel thereto.
Restraint system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that if the backrest
(6) is divided only one belt (2) is used.
Restraint system according to claim 3, characterised in that the part of the
backrest (6) not restrained by the belt (2) is fixable to the restrained part by

means of a bolt.
Restraint system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the belt (2) is tensioned by an automatic rolling-up device (1).
Restraint system according to claim 5, characterised in that the automatic
rolling-up device (1) is fixed below the backrest (6) to the vehicle chassis.
Restraint system according to claim 6, characterised in that the automatic
rolling-up device (1) is disposed on a reinforcing part, preferably in the form of

a cross-member (8).
Restraint system according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the automatic
rolling-up device (1) is disposed outside the passenger space and/or outside

the loading space. 
Restraint system according to one of claims 5 to 8, characterised in that the
automatic rolling-up device (1) is encapsulated.
Restraint system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the belt (2) is passed inside the backrest (6) from its upper region (18)

downward.
Restraint system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the belt (2) is anchored on a cross-member (7) incorporated in the tailgate

(10).
Restraint system according to claim 11, characterised in that the cross-member
(7) extends over the entire width of the tailgate (10).
Restraint system according to claim 12, characterised in that the part of the
tailgate frame (21) associated with the body is supported in the region of the

cross-member end point by reinforcing elements (26) extending roughly in the
longitudinal direction of the body.
Restraint system according to claim 13, characterised in that the reinforcing
elements (26) are connected to the tailgate frame (21) on the one side and to a

vehicle side wall (28) and/or a rear wheel case (27) on the other side.
Restraint system according to claim 13 or 14, characterised in that the part of
the support profile (26) associated with the rear is formed as a catch element.
Restraint system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the belt end associated with the rear is connected detachably to the

tailgate (10). 
Restraint system according to claim 16, characterised in that on a cross-member
(7) integral with the tailgate (10) a belt lock (11) is fixed, into which a

belt lock tongue disposed on the belt end associated with the vehicle rear is
locatable.
Restraint system according to claim 17, characterised in that the belt lock (11)
is pivotable about a horizontal axis (22) extending transverse to the direction of

travel.
Restraint system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that in the contact region of the belt (2) with the vehicle ceiling (15) and/or the

tailgate frame upper edge arising when the tailgate is pivoted up an abrasion-resistant
plastics wear protection (16) is mounted.
Restraint system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the belt hand (2) is the same as that of a conventional safety belt.
