A method of producing profiles (3) of definite length from an 
elastomer material comprising at least one protruding sealing lip (12) of 

differing contour (32) over the profile length, said sealing lip (12) being 
extruded with a maximum cross-section and subsequently reduced to the 

predetermined contour profile (32), characterized in that by means of two 
needles (10, 11) affecting said sealing lip (12) on the side, which are 

controlled in their engaging height (a) by a cam disk (5), said given contour 
profile (32) in the corresponding profile region (12) is nicked groove-shaped 

and the excess profile section (38) is parted off after the following 
vulcanization. 
The method as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that by means 
of protruding indexer pimples (15) on said cam disk (5) vertical nicks (37) 

of a corresponding predetermined length of a profile (3) are applied in said 
profile (3) and subsequently the continuous profile (3) is parted at said 

nicks (37) into profiles of definite length. 
An apparatus for producing profiles (3) of definite length from an 
elastomer material comprising at least one protruding sealing lip (12) of 

different contour (32) more particularly in accordance with the method as 
set forth in claim 1, comprising an extruder (2) and means for reducing 

said sealing lip (12) to said predetermined contour profile (32), 
characterized in that in a variator (4) arranged vertically shiftable upstream 

of the orifice (1) of said extruder (2) two hard metal needles (10, 11) are 
arranged, oriented inclined to each other and in that said variator (4) is 

actively connected spring-loaded via a vertical follower (6) to a cam disk 
(5) reproducing said predetermined contour (32) of the corresponding 

profile region (12). 
The apparatus as set forth in claim 3, characterized in that said 
variator (4) is directly secured to said orifice (1) of said extruder (2). 
The apparatus as set forth in claim 3, characterized in that the 
rotary speed of said cam disk (5) is controllable as a function of a  

 
measuring wheel (21) for establishing the dispensing rate of said extruded 

profile (3). 
The apparatus as set forth in claim 3, characterized in that said 
variator (4) is followed by a vulcanization section (22) and subsequently 

two parting rolls (23) for parting said protruding profile section (38) nicked 
by said hard metal needles (10, 11). 
The apparatus as set forth in claim 3, characterized in that one 
revolution of said cam disk (5) corresponds to the length of one profile of 

definite length and in that said cam disk (5) comprises on its 
circumference a protruding indexer pimple (15), the corresponding 

impressions (37) of which on said profile (3) are readable downstream of 
said parting rolls (23) by a light barrier (27), the signal of which is 

evaluatable for signal control of a subsequent means for cutting to length.
