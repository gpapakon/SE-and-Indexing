<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method for the thermal
cleaning of objects, in particular for removing materials
such as plastics and such from metal objects, whereby the
objects to be cleaned are placed in a room and are heated
by a heating means, the temperature of the objects to be
cleaned being controlled by means of a control system
provided with a temperature sensor with which the
temperature is sensed. It is known that during the removal of plastics from
metal objects by means of a thermal process, it is a
problem to keep the temperature of the metal objects
under strict control.As the objects are often expensive, such as tools or
machine parts, for example from the fibres industry,
such as moulds in which plastics have congealed, a
strict temperature control is very important, however,
during a thermal cleaning, since the metal can lose its
good mechanical properties when the temperature is too
high, as a result of which the above-mentioned objects
are damaged or lose much of their quality.Moreover, in case of a non-homogenous temperature
distribution over the metal object, damages may occur
due to the ensuing tensions arising in the metal.Cleaning furnaces are already known in which the
temperature is controlled. However, the known
embodiments show several disadvantages and defects.In certain pyrolysis furnaces, the pyrolysis process is
kept under control by injecting water in the furnace
room when the temperature in the furnace gets too high. A major disadvantage hereby is that the objects therein
are subject to strongly varying temperatures and often
start to corrode. With some objects there is also the
disadvantage that, due to the periodical injection of
water in certain places, the temperature in the objects
to be treated is not homogenous, as a result of which
damages may occur.In other furnaces, called vacuum furnaces, a vacuum is
created in the furnace during the first part of the
cleaning cycle. During said first part of the cleaning
cycle, the furnace room is slowly heated, such that at
first, the main part of the plastics which are present
on the object to be cleaned is melted off. This melted-off
plastics are carried off to a receiver outside the
heated furnace room, where the plastics congeal again.Afterwards, the furnace temperature is further increased
up to a value at which the plastic residues on the
object to be cleaned can pyrolyse, for example at 400°C
to 450°C. The vacuum in the furnace is then maintained
for a certain time, to make sure that the plastic
residues which
