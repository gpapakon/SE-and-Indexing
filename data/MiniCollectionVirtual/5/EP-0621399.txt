<ABSTRACT>
Method for driving an auxiliary device (6) of an internal combustion engine after the latter has stopped, using controlled circuit-breaker means (4, 8) acting on the electrical supply circuit (16) of the auxiliary device (6), characterised in that the circuit-breaker means (4, 8) act in response to control signals sent out on the one hand by the engine management system (1) from a first output stage (2) and, on the other hand, by actuation of the ignition key, the said first output stage (2) of the engine management system (1) also emitting control signals used to control the operation of a second auxiliary device (3).
