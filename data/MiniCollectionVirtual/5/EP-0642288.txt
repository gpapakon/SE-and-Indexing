<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an optical switching
system, and more specifically to a wavelength time division multiplexed
optical switching system in which optical signals are multiplexed both in
time and wavelength domains to provide switching between time slots
and between wavelengths.A prior art time and wavelength division multiplexed optical
switching system described in JP-A-158661/84 is
made up of a first time switching stage, an intermediate, wavelength
switching stage and a second time switching stage, with the successive
stages being interconnected by optical links. However, the use of two
time switching stages requires a substantial amount of optical switching
elements. In addition, the time-wavelength-time switching
configuration lacks the ability to implement a multistage configuration
having a capacity exceeding beyond the capacity of "n x m" multiplex.Another prior art system is a time and wavelength division
multiplexed system for transmission of a desired program from a central
source to subscriber terminals. This involves the use of a substantial
amount of optical components such as wavelength selectors and
photodiode arrays and electronic components such as time division
selectors and electrooptical converters.JP-A-96893/86 discloses a light exchange device
with a time switch to exchange a time slot in
correspondence to the wavelength of the multiplex light
signal, a wavelength converter, and a space switch.SMPTE JOURNAL, USA, vol. 96, no. 7, July 1987 ISSN 0036-1682,
pages 660-666, OLIPHANT A ET AL 'An optical routing system for
tomorrow's television studio centers' ", discloses a TWDM optical routing
system according to the preamble of claim 1. It is an object of the present invention to provide a time
and wavelength switch having reduced optical components and
which allows a multistage configuration. This object
is achieved with the features of the claims.The present invention will be described in further detail with reference
to the accompanying drawings, in which:

division multiplexed switching system, and Fig. 1B is an illustration for
describing the operation of the prior art system;Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a prior art time and wavelength
