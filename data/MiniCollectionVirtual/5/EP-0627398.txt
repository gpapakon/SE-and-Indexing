<ABSTRACT>
Ortho esters of the structure 

wherein R₁ and R₂ are different or the same alkyl moieties and 
can be a saturated, unsaturated, branched, unbranched or cyclic 

alkyl moiety of 1-3 carbon atoms, are prepared by first 
anhydrously reacting hydrogen cyanide or a hydrogen cyanide 

derivative with a secondary alkanol and hydrogen chloride in the 
presence of an inert organic solvent. Upon the formation of the 

resulting imino ether hydrochloride, more secondary alkanol is 
added to form the ortho esters (I). 1,1-Dialkoxycycloalkanes of 

the structure 

wherein R₁ and R₂ correspond to R₁ and R₂ of structure (I), and n 
is an integer from 4 to 9, are prepared by reacting with the 

imino ether hydrochloride more secondary alkanol and a 
cycloalkanone having 5 to 10 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a "one-pot" preparation of
ortho esters. The ortho esters are
compounds of the structure (I)

wherein R1 and R2 are different or the same alkyl moieties and
can be a saturated, unsaturated, branched, unbranched or cyclic
alkyl moiety of 1-3 carbon atoms.The ortho esters defined by structure (I) are useful water
scavengers in organic reaction and solvents. The ortho esters
can be used to generate an anhydrous medium for reactions or
other processes where the presence of water can be a detriment. 
The compounds defined by
structure (I) are also useful intermediates in the
manufacture of pharmaceutical, photographic or agricultural
products.In the process of the invention, compounds of the structure
(I) are prepared by first preparing an imino ether hydrochloride
by reacting hydrogen cyanide with a secondary alkanol and
hydrogen chloride in the presence of an inert organic solvent.
Compounds of structure (I) are then prepared by further addition
of secondary alkanol to the reaction mixture.It is known (from S. Patai, Chemistry of Functional Groups,
Chemistry of Amidines and Amidates, Wiley, 1975, p. 389-394) that
when an organic acid nitrile is reacted with a primary alcohol
and hydrogen chloride an imino ether hydrochloride is formed.
This reaction scheme, generally known as the "Pinner" reaction,
involves two steps for the preparation of ortho esters. First,
an organic acid nitrile, primary alcohol and hydrogen chloride
are reacted to prepare an imino ether hydrochloride. Second, the
imino ether hydrochloride is separated from the reaction mixture
by crystallization, washed for purification and subsequently
subjected to alcoholysis with additional primary alcohol to
afford the ortho ester.Thus, the Pinner reaction is discontinuous by virtue of the
purification step and expensive because of the large amount of
solvent required. Without the purification step, however, the 
ortho ester is not formed to a significant extent. Further,
in this process, the yield of the ortho ester obtained
fluctuates. The ortho ester of the primary alcohol thus
obtained can be reacted with a secondary alcohol in the
presence of an acid catalyst to obtain the ortho ester of
structure (I).In the method of the invention, however, the preparation
of orthoesters of structure (I) is continuous because the
purification and transesterification are removed. The ortho
ester obtained consistently exceeds 70% in yield and 99% in
purity.It is known from US-A-2567927 to produce aliphatic
orthoformic esters
