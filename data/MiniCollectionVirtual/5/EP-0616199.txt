<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a load cell for 
electrically detecting a load imposed on a strain inducing element of a 
specific configuration, by the utilization of an electric characteristic of 
a strain detecting element such as, for example, a strain gauge, 
mounted on the strain inducing element, and a weighing apparatus such 
as an electronic scale using the load cell. The load cell used in an electronic scale generally is 
employed in the form of a strain inducing element as shown in Fig. 12 
and comprises fixed and movable rigid bodies a1 and a2 opposite to 
each other and a pair of parallel beams b1 and b2 extending between 
the fixed and movable rigid bodies a1 and a2. All of those elements a1, 
a2, b1 and b2 are defined by forming a cave c in a generally rectangular 
cubic metal block so that the fixed and movable rigid bodies a1 and a2 
occupy respective opposite end portions of the metal block while the 
parallel beams b1 and b2 occupy respective opposite side portions of 
the metal block. The cave c is so shaped and so configured as to leave 
pairs of thin walled strain generating areas d1 and d2, d3 and d4, the 
strain generating areas d1 and d2 of one pair being defined at 
respective junctions of opposite ends of the beam b1 with the fixed and 
movable rigid bodies a1 and a2 while the strain generating areas d3 and 
d4 of the other pair are defined at respective junctions of opposite ends 
of the beam b2 with the fixed and movable rigid bodies a1 and a2. The prior art strain inducing element A is so designed and 
so structured that, when a load W is applied to the movable rigid body 
a2, a considerable deformation occurs at the thin-walled strain generating  
 
areas d1 to d4 as shown by the phantom line, causing the movable 
rigid body a2 to undergo a parallel downward motion relative to the 
fixed rigid body a1. In other words, the strain generating areas d1 to 
d4 generate respective strains in a quantity proportional to the applied 
load W to reduce any possible adverse influence brought about by a 
bending moment. In practice, the fixed rigid body a1 of the strain 
inducing element A is rigidly secured to a base E of the electronic 
scale while the movable rigid body a2 is coupled with a scale table F. 
Strain detecting elements G such as, for example, strain gauges, are 
immovably placed on respective surfaces of the strain inducing element 
A in alignment with at least two of the strain generating areas d1 and 
d2 (or d3 and d4) so that a tensile strain and a
