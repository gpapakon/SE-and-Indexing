<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical recording medium in
which a data area is constituted by a pit string made up of pits
formed along the track center scanned by a laser beam and lands
(mirror surface sections) and in which the pit string in the data
area is read with pre-set clocks so as to be reproduced as
information signals, a method for reproducing data recorded on
the optical recording medium, and a data recording device or
laser cutting device employed for producing the optical recording
medium.An optical recording medium, such as one run into rotation
at CAV (constant angular velocity), referred to herein as an
optical disc, has a recording format, such as a recording format
for a data area as shown in Fig.21, in which pits P are formed
along a track center Tc, with a pit width d of 0.5 µm and a pit
length per clock of 0.86 µm and at a track pitch Tp of 1.6 µm
along the disc radius, and are aligned in their positions along
the track direction. The portions devoid of the pits are lands
left as mirror surface regions.For reproducing information signals from the optical disc 
having the above-mentioned recording format, the disc is rotated
at CAV and a playback laser beam is radiated on the track center
Tc for relative scanning with a laser spot BS.The laser beam reflected from the optical disc is caused to
fall on a light receiving element and converted into detected
signals as electrical signals having a signal level corresponding
to the reflected light volume. The detected signals are further
demodulated by a signal demodulating circuit for producing
playback information data.The reflected light falling on the light receiving element
after reflection by the mirror surface region is the light which
has undergone substantially total reflection by the mirror
surface. Thus the reflected light volume is abundant so that a
detection signal having a high signal level is outputted from the
light receiving element. On the other hand, the light volume of
the reflected light modulated by the pit is lesser than that of
the reflected light from the mirror surface region, so that a
detection signal having a low signal level is outputted from the
light receiving element.In a downstream signal processor, detection signals
outputted in series by the light receiving element are sampled
with pre-set clock signals and thereby converted to bi-level data
having a pulse amplitude corresponding to the signal level. The
bi-level data is processed for decoding error-correction codes,
such as parity codes or
