<ABSTRACT>
In order to damp the vibrations in a specified location subjected to a primary field of vibrations, a vibrational wave is generated which is intended to interfere with the primary field at this location, through adaptive filtering of a reference signal. The device comprises n processing channels each having a digital filter (14) for feeding an actuator (16), fed with a sinusoidal signal of frequency specific to the filter and corresponding to a concentration of vibrational energy of the primary field. The coefficients of the filter can be adapted by a specific loop which receives an error signal (e) and the input signal of the digital filter, filtered by a loop filter (18). The outputs from the channels are added together and applied to the actuator.

A method for active damping of vibration at at least
one predetermined location subjected to a primary vibration

field, comprising generating avibratory wave for interfering
with the primary field at said location, by adaptive

filtering of a reference signal; measuring the residual

plurality of substantially sine-shaped individual reference

signals (x
