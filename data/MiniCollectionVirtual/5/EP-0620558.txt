<ABSTRACT>
In a boiling water reactor fuel bundle (B), a three 
dimensional debris catching grid construction is placed within 

the flow volume defined by the lower tie plate assembly (T) between 
the inlet nozzle and upper fuel rod supporting grid (G). A 

perforated plate is utilized having round holes as small 
consistent with the prevention of inadvertent closure due 

crudding and a hole pitch consistent with mechanical integrity 
requirements. The perforated plate is placed in a three 

dimensional construction such as a dome (44), cylinder (60), pyramid, 
inverted pyramid (80) or corrugated construction (100) spanning the flow 

volume of the lower tie plate assembly (T). As a consequence of 
this three dimensional grid construction, the total flow 

through area of the perforations in the metal plate does not 
introduce appreciable pressure drop in the lower tie plate 

assembly (T) between the inlet nozzle and the rod supporting grid (G). 
Fluid movement at the debris restraining holes of the grid 

construction has a low flow velocity and a change in flow 
direction before passing through the holes to discourage debris 

from finding its way through the grid holes. Finally, it is 
possible to incorporate debris traps (72,95) within the flow volume of 

the lower tie plate assembly (T) that can cause trapping and 
subsequent removal of trapped debris upon fuel bundle 

replacement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a boiling water nuclear reactor
fuel bundle including a debris catching arrangement
for incorporation within the flow volume between
the inlet nozzle and the rod supporting grid of the lower
tie plate assembly.Boiling water nuclear reactors operate for many
years. Commencing with their initial construction and
through their service lives, these reactors may accumulate
debris in their closed circulation moderator systems.
This debris can become an operating hazard if the debris
is allowed to enter into the fuel bundle containing
core region having the heat generating fuel rods. In order
to understand this problem, a summary of reactor
construction as it relates to the accumulation of debris
in the core needs first to be given. Thereafter, fuel bundle
construction will be set forth. Emphasis will be given
to the need to preserve substantially unchanged the regions
of pressure drop within the fuel bundles. Thereafter,
the effects caused by debris entering into the fuel
rod region of the fuel bundles will be summarized.Boiling water nuclear reactor construction can be
simply summarized for purposes of understanding the
debris entrainment problem. Such nuclear reactors are
provided with a large, central core. Liquid water coolant/moderator flow enters the core from the bottom and exits
the core as a water steam mixture from the top.The core includes many side-by-side fuel bundles.
Water is introduced into each fuel bundle through a fuel
bundle support casting from a high pressure plenum
which is situated below the core. Water passes in a distributed
flow through the individual fuel bundles, is heated
to generate steam, and exits the upper portion of the
core as a two phase water steam mixture from which
the steam is extracted for the generation of energy.The core support castings and fuel bundles are a
source of pressure loss in the circulation of water
through the core. This pressure loss assures the substantially
even distribution of flow across the individual
fuel bundles of the reactor core. When it is remembered
that there are as many as 750 individual fuel bundles in
a reactor core, it can be appreciated that assurance of
the uniformity of flow distribution is important. To interfere
with the pressure drop within the fuel bundles could
effect the overall distribution of coolant/moderator within
the fuel bundles of the reactor core.Having set forth the construction of the boiling water
nuclear reactor in so far as is appropriate, attention can
now be directed to the
