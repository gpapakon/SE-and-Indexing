<ABSTRACT>
An improved redundancy architecture is provided for 
an array of flash EEPROM cells which permit repair of 

defective columns of memory cells in the array with 
redundant columns of memory cells on a sector-by-sector 

basis. The redundancy circuitry includes a plurality of 
sector-based redundancy blocks (2-8) each having redundant 

columns of memory cells extending through the 
plurality of sectors. Sector selection transistors 

(Q1,Q2) are provided for dividing the redundant columns 
into different segments, each residing in at least one of 

the plurality of sectors and for isolating the different 
segments so as to allow independent use from other 

segments in the same redundant column in repairing 
defective columns in the corresponding ones of the 

plurality of sectors. Addressable fuse storage circuitry 
(314a,314b) is used for storing sector-based redundancy 

column addresses, each defining a column address 
containing the defective column of memory cells in the 

plurality of sectors in association with one of the 
different redundant column segments to be used in 

repairing the defective column.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor integrated 
circuit memory devices such as floating gate 
memory devices such as an array of flash electrically 
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) cells 
with redundancy architecture. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to an improved redundancy 
architecture for an array of flash EEPROM cells which 
permit repairing of defective columns of memory cells in 
the array with spare redundant columns of memory cells on 
a sector-by-sector basis. As is generally well known, semiconductor memory 
devices are manufactured with a memory array of elements 
which are accessed by a row decoder and a column decoder 
to address a particular memory element or row of memory 
elements in the memory array. A sense amplifier is built 
in the semiconductor chip for sensing the memory state of 
the selected memory element when addressed by the row 
decoder and column decoder. In recent years, the density 
of the memory array on a semiconductor chip has increased 
to over 1 million memory elements. As the density of the 
memory array on a semiconductor chip increases, it 
becomes a significantly more difficult task to produce 
perfect semiconductor memory chips. In an effort to 
improve production yields and memory chip reliability,  
 
spare or redundant columns of memory cells have been 
included on the semiconductor chip so as to allow for 
repairing or replacing defective columns of memory cells 
in an array. The semiconductor memory is generally first tested 
while it is still in a semiconductor wafer joined with 
other semiconductor memory chips to determine whether it 
operates properly. If a faulty area is located, extra 
memory circuits can then be substituted for the defective 
elements in this faulty area on the primary memory array 
of memory elements. Typically, circuitry is required for 
selectively deactivating the defective column of memory 
cells when repair is desired and for activating a 
redundant column of memory cells to replace the 
deactivated column. In order to be able to repair a 
defect anywhere in the array, the redundant column is 
required to run the entire length of the array. 
Previously, column repair was realized in flash EEPROM 
arrays only on an array-based redundancy where only one 
defective column in the entire array could be repaired by 
the redundant column. Accordingly, there has arisen a need for utilizing 
the redundant column on a more efficient and effective 
manner. There has been discovered by the
