<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display system comprising a first 
display member (30) overlying a second display member (31). 

Each member comprises two transparent layers (32,33) (such 
as glass), coated with polariser (34,35),(38,39) and 

separated by a layer of liquid crystal. Each member has a 
set of individually actuable display elements (21,52,53). 

The display elements in the second member, and are visible 
through the first member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display system such as a 
liquid crystal display (LCD) system. A typical display system is of the kind having a 
number of selectively actuable display elements which can 
be actuated individually to generate a number of different 
display patterns. Such systems are hereinafter referred to 
as of the kind described. A problem which can arise in some circumstances in 
connection with display systems is where it is required 
that the display system has a very large number of 
individually actuable display elements. Each element needs 
to have its own actuating wire and the wires must be 
connected from the element to drive circuitry. This makes 
it very difficult to pack a large number of display 
elements into a small area. GB-A-2046494 describes an LCD which provides analogue 
and digital readings which overlap each other and are still 
distinguishable on the same display. The display comprises 
a stack with a rear polariser, three glass layers with a 
liquid crystal layer between each of the two interfaces, 
and a front polariser. The rear liquid crystal layer is actuated by 
electrodes to provide a digital display, and the front 
layer provides an analogue display. The display must be manufactured as a single unit, and 
the analogue and digital layers cannot be manufactured or 
operated separately. US-A-4,952,036 discloses another display comprising two 
liquid crystal cells; the two cells are stacked and aligned so 
that each active display element of the first cell is in 
alignment with an inactive area of the second cell and vice 
versa. In the case of this prior art display only a single 
polarizer is disposed between the two liquid crystal cells so 
that the whole system comprises three polarizers.  
 In accordance with the present invention, a display 
system comprises a first display member having a set of 
individually switchable display elements and a second 
display member having a set of individually switchable 
display elements, the first member overlying the second 
member; wherein each member comprises a liquid crystal layer contained between two transparent 
substrates, and each 
transparent substrate is at least partially coated with a polarising layer; and 
wherein the display elements of the second member are laterally 
offset from the display elements of the first member 
and wherein the four polarising layers are arranged such that the display elements of 
the second member 
are visible through the first member.  
 In this case, a large number of

<CLAIMS>
A display system comprising a first display member 
(30) having a set of individually switchable display elements 

(21) and a second display member (31) having a set of 
individually switchable display elements (52,53), the first 

display member overlying the second member; wherein each 
member comprises a liquid crystal layer contained between two transparent substrates (32,33) 

and each transparent substrate is at 
least partially coated with a polarising layer (34,35;38,39); and wherein 

the display elements of the second member are laterally offset from 
the display elements of the first member and wherein the four polarising layers are arranged such that the display elements of the second member are visible 

through the first member. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein different 
portions of the areas of the first and second display 

members are not coated with a polarising layer. 
A system according to claim 2, wherein the area of 
each display member containing a polarising layer 

substantially corresponds to the area in the other layer 
with no polarising layer, whereby the display elements in 

each layer are visible through the other layer when 
actuated. 
A system according to claim 3, wherein the two 
polarising layers on each member polarise light in parallel 

directions. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein the four 
polarising layers (34',35')(38'39') overlap in selected 

regions to provide fixed indicia (40). 
A display system according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the first display member comprises a number 

of substantially identical, individually switchable display 
elements (21) arranged side by side; and control means (64) 

for selectively and simultaneously actuating a block of 
adjacent display elements, and for simulating movement of 

the block by actuating the next leading display element 
in the direction of movement and deactuating the trailing 

element while maintaining actuation of a display element or display elements 
between the leading and trailing display element.  

 
A system according to claim 6, wherein the control 
means deactuates at least one central display element (24) of the 

block. 
A system according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein each 
block comprises an odd number of display elements, for 

example 5 or 7. 
A system according to any of claims 6 to 8, wherein 
the display elements are arranged partially or completely 

around a circular arc. 
A system according to any of claims 6 to 9, further 
comprising indicia (25) arranged alongside the display 

elements, the indicia defining values of a parameter. 
A system according to any of claims 6 to 10, wherein 
the second member has a number of digital display elements 

(52,53).
