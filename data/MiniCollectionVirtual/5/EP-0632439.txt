<ABSTRACT>
A method of regulating the transverse position of a running magnetic 
tape (4) comprising steps of generating a unidirectional 

travelling-surface-wave by ultrasonic oscillation on a surface of an 
oscillator (62A,62B;65;66A,66B), and pressing the surface of the 

oscillator against a surface of the magnetic tape (4) so that the 
travelling direction (B,D) of the surface wave on the oscillator 

(62A,62B;65;66A,66B), has a component directed in transverse direction 
of the magnetic tape (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of and a system for regulating
the transverse position of a running magnetic tape.As is well known, in a videotape recorder, or an audiotape
recorder the magnetic tape is conventionally run by a capstan
and a pinch roller rotated at constant speed. However, when a
thin magnetic tape such as a long-playing tape is driven by such
a driving system, the magnetic tape is apt to twist or meander
to adversely affect running of the tape, or is sometimes
stretched by tension, thereby making it impossible to effect
accurate tracking.SU-A-670 974 discloses a magnetic tape piezo-electric driving
system using two types of piezo elements. A transverse movement
element with a slot operates at the center with two alternately
operating tape pressure elements on both side of a housing.
Control pulses operate pressure element first pressing the tape
against the slot side. The transverse element pulls the tape.
Second pressure element removes the slack moving the tape
forward. This driving system offers relative high speed and
uniformity of tape movement.JP-A-58-196653 discloses a magnetic tape guide device in which
a piezo electric element vibrates in the width direction of the
tape so that the protrusions at the upper and lower edges
thereof abut to the tape edges and thereby the tape is guided to
a predetermined position in the width direction.From FR-A-2 522216 a motor device using an ultrasonic device
for driving a tape in its running direction is known. This
device generates an ultrasonic surface wave at the surface of
an oscillator for driving the tape.It is the object of the invention to provide an improved method
and an improved system for
regulating the transverse position of the running magnetic tape.This object is solved according to the invention by a method as
claimed in claim 1 and by a system as claimed in claim 2. In accordance with the present invention, a unidirectional
travelling-surface-wave by ultrasonic oscillation is generated
on a surface of an oscillator, and a magnetic tape position is
regulated in the direction transverse to the travelling
direction of the tape by pressing the surface of the oscillator
against a surface of the magnetic 
tape. As the oscillator, an electrostrictor or
a magnetostrictor is used.That is, in the present invention, the principle of
an ultrasonic motor which generates a surface wave (flexure
vibration) by ultrasonic oscillation by the use of
an electrostrictor or a magnetostrictor is applied. As for
the ultrasonic motor, see, for
