<ABSTRACT>
In telescopic crane jibs with a basic jib body (2) and several telescopic sections (3, 4) which can be extended in a telescoped manner from the basic jib body (2) via a hydromechanical telescoping device (7, 8) connected to it, the jib as a rule is telescoped either fully hydraulically or hydraulically in combination with ropes. In the process, several telescopic parts, for example, can in each case be extended in synchronism. An improvement is achieved with the concept of using the stroke of a hydraulic telescoping device (7, 8) in the one direction for the direct extension of one telescopic section (3) and in the other direction - after locking the telescopic section - for the indirect extension, effected via a rope (11), of a further telescopic section (4). The relevant design provides for a movable telescoping cylinder (8) of the telescoping device to be capable of being locked to one telescopic section (3) and for the telescopic sections (3, 4) to be capable of being locked to one another as well as to the basic body (2) in their respective end positions, and for a telescoping rope (11) to be run between the base of the telescoping cylinder (8) and the base of the second telescopic section (4) via a deflection pulley (10) at the tip of the preceding telescopic section (3) and for a return rope (12) to accordingly be run the other way round.
