<ABSTRACT>
A support leg comprising an upstanding member (12) and securing means (18) for securing an elongate member (44) to the upstanding member (12). When the elongate member is secured to the upstanding member, a planar member (42A to 42E) can be supported on the elongate member to define at least a part of a platform (40). The securing means is movable from a securing position to secure the elongate member (44) to the upstanding member (12) and a non-securing position where member can be removed from the upstanding member. The support leg is suitable for use in forming a platform (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to platforms with support legs. It is often necessary for plasterers and builders to 
use some form of platform to reach, for example, ceilings. Specification No. FR-A-559494 discloses a support 
for scaffolding. Various other forms of platform are used. For 
example a trestle may be used upon which the workman can 
stand, or, in cases where trestles are not available, a 
make-shift platform may be constructed using, for example, 
milk crates and planks of wood. However, the prior art 
constructions are unsatisfactory since, they are unstable 
and lacking in strength. It is an object of the present invention to obviate 
and/or mitigate these disadvantages of the prior art. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a platform comprising a support leg, an elongate 
member which can be secured to the support leg and a 
platform member which can be supported on the elongate 
member, the support leg comprising support means, and 
securing means for securing the elongate member to the  
 
support means, the securing means being movable from a 
securing position to secure the elongate member to the 
support means and a non-securing position where the 
elongate member can be removed from the support means, 
characterised in that the securing means comprises a 
projecting element adapted to engage said platform member 
when the securing means is in the securing position, 
thereby to hold the platform member on the elongate 
member. The projecting element may be elongate and may 
extend transversely from the upstanding member when the 
securing means is in the securing position. Preferably, the securing means is adapted to receive 
the elongate member. The securing means may be in the 
form of a substantially U-shaped member adapted to receive 
an end portion of the elongate member. The U-shaped 
member may be curved to receive substantially cylindrical 
elongate members. Alternatively, the U-shaped member may 
be square or rectangular to receive elongate members 
having a substantially square or rectangular 
cross-section. The U-shaped member may be provided with a threaded 
aperture to receive a bolt therein, to engage an elongate  
 
member received in the U-shaped member. The bolt may be 
of a configuration having a first threaded portion and a 
second portion extending transversely from the first 
threaded portion. Preferably, the second portion 
constitutes said projecting element. Preferably, the bolt 
is substantially L-shaped. The invention is particularly
