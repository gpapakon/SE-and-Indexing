<ABSTRACT>
A mounting is provided for securing a roller shutter 
at an appropriate opening, such as in a cabinet. The 

mounting comprises a pair of brackets for securing on 
respective walls of the cabinet interior near the top of 

the opening. The roller shutter is mounted to each 
bracket 1 by way of an arm 20 which has an aperture 28 

for engaging a spindle of a roller core. Each arm 20 is 
pivotally mounted in an aperture 10 in a bracket. The 

arm 20 is capable of tilting under the influence of the 
weight of shutter drawn from the roller so as to displace 

the core of the roller towards the opening (8 or 8'). In 
this way, the shutter assembly may be used effectively 

without the need for a separate guide roller for guiding 
passage of shutter from a storage roller to the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mountings and brackets for 
a roller assembly of the kind commonly found in shuttered 
cabinets and similar structures. Roller assemblies for cabinets in which a slatted 
shutter or the like is arranged for covering an opening 
in the cabinet, are well known. The shutter is wound 
onto a core of a storage roller and arranged such that it 
is capable of being drawn therefrom over the cabinet 
opening into a closed position, and of being wound back 
onto the core of the storage roller into an open 
position. For such applications, the shutter is typically 
wound on a storage roller which incorporates a cross 
sectionally square ended spindle. The spindle is spring 
biassed rotationally so that it will contribute to 
winding up of the shutter. In such a cabinet the edges of the shutter covering 
the opening of the cabinet are generally accommodated in 
guide tracks, running alongside this opening. The 
storage roller core, which is quite bulky, will generally 
be fixedly mounted in the top of the cabinet and offset  
 
from the opening. A separate guide roller is usually 
disposed at the top of the cabinet and adjacent the 
opening. The guide roller assists engagement of the 
shutter in the guide tracks alongside the cabinet opening 
as the shutter is wound from and onto the storage roller 
core. Thus, when constructing such cabinets, it is often 
necessary to install both a storage roller and a guide 
roller in order to ensure smooth running of the shutter 
in its guide tracks alongside the opening. However, the 
need for both a guide roller and a storage roller may 
make installation time consuming and complicated. It 
also adds to the bulkiness of the shutter assembly. In 
many applications it would be desirable to reduce the 
bulk of the shutter assembly, so as to leave more useful 
space available inside the cabinet. The present invention seeks to alleviate such 
problems by providing a mounting for a roller assembly 
which may be relatively compact and easy to install. The 
invention also seeks to provide a mounting which may 
assist in guiding the path of the shutter released from 
the storage roller. Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention 
provides a mounting for securing a roller shutter at an  
 
opening, the mounting comprising first and second 
brackets to be secured near the opening and means for 
mounting a core of a roller shutter between the brackets, 
characterised in that the mounting means are arranged to 
effect displacement of the roller core with

A mounting for securing a roller shutter at an 
opening, the mounting comprising first and second 

brackets and means for mounting a core of a roller 
shutter between the brackets, characterised in that the 

mounting means are arranged to permit displacement of the 
roller core with respect to the brackets and towards the 

opening under the influence of the weight of shutter 
drawn from the roller. 
A mounting according to Claim 1 wherein the mounting 
means for the roller core are adapted to engage a spindle 

of a roller which is spring biassed in the rotary sense 
to contribute to winding up of the shutter. 
A mounting according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
mounting means for the roller core are arranged to be 

pivotally movable about an axis offset from the core so 
as to effect angular displacement of the roller core as 

shutter is drawn therefrom. 
A mounting according to Claim 3 having means for 
limiting the extent of angular displacement of the roller 

core. 
A mounting according to Claim 4 wherein a bracket 
has a sectorial well and a mounting means for the roller 

core comprises an arm accommodated in the well and 
arranged to be pivotally movable between radii of the 

well so as to effect angular displacement of the roller 
core. 
A mounting according to Claim 5 wherein the arm has 
one or more flanges arranged to overlie the bracket at 

the well so as to resist release of the arm from the 

bracket. 
A mounting according to any preceding claim wherein 
the mounting means for the roller core are releasably 

securable to a bracket. 
A mounting according to any preceding claim wherein 
a bracket is recessed to accommodate an edge of a roller 

core and shutter wound thereon. 
A mounting according to any preceding claim wherein 
a bracket includes a guide track which defines a path for 

the shutter released from the roller core and the 
mounting means are arranged to allow displacement of the 

core of the roller towards the guide track as shutter is 
unwound therefrom. 
A mounting according to Claim 9 wherein a bracket 
includes two spaced guide tracks and the mounting means 

for the roller core are adapted to permit displacement 
towards either selected guide track.
