<ABSTRACT>
In a fluid valving system, binary fluid control lines are 
connected in parallel between a common fluid inlet and a common 

fluid outlet. Each line has a binary valve and a metering 
orifice for passing a predetermined rate of fluid flow. The 

rates are in a geometric progression in factors of two. An 
analog fluid control line is connected in parallel with the 

binary lines, and has a continuously adjustable flow rate 
regulator for passing any selected rate of fluid flow up to a 

maximum at least equal to the largest increment of rate change 
in the binary lines. The regulator is formed of a miniature 

solid state device. A controller sets each binary valve open or 
closed, and sets the regulator for a selected flow rate, such 

that cooperative settings provide for a smoothly variable rate 
of total fluid flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valving system for varying fluid rates as claimed in the
preamble of claim 1. The system especially relates to the varying of fluid flow
rates and, particularly, to the breed of binary and analog control of fluid flow
rates.There are many requirements as well as metering devices for
maintaining and changing fluid flow rates. For example, in
certain applications it is necessary to turn on or shut off a
preset fluid flow over a short period of time. Another type of
application is where a flow rate must be selected with
precision, for example, for carrier gas in atomic absorption
spectrometric instruments, or in gas or liquid chromatography.
In such instruments with electronic and computerized controls,
the older conventional methods such as motors connected to
conventional flow meters for setting and changing flows have
become cumbersome and not readily adaptable, particularly where
precision is required.Most conventional flow meters are adjustable continuously over
the operational range of flow rates and may not have the
required precision. Another class of flow controllers utilizes
an arrangement of binary flow control devices. These place a
plurality of fluid lines in parallel, each having an on-off
valve in series with a fixed flow control such as a precision
orifice. The orifice is a different size in each line, or in at
least some of the lines, so that combinations selected with the
valves select fluid flow rate in increments. In one type of
system, each fixed flow line passes fluid at a rate that is a
factor of two greater than a preceding line in a sequence of the
lines, as disclosed in U.S. patent Nos. 2,999,482, 3,726,296, 
3,746,041 and 4,768,544. Other relative orifice sizes may be
combined, for example as disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,030,523
to attain steps in increments of 10% of the maximum flow, and
U.S. patent No. 4,628,961 which discloses a stepper valve with
equal flows.A more recent class of devices for controlling fluid flow rates
are formed in miniature solid state semiconductor chips and
other materials using techniques similar to those of forming
integrated electronic circuits. Such devices and techniques are
described in detail in U.S. patent No. 4,821,997. A specific
device is a Fluistor" as described in an article "The Fluistor
Microstructure is Poised for Commercialization", (no author),

a common fluid inlet (20) receptive of fluid input, and a common
fluid outlet (22) for discharging a total flow;

predetermined rates of flow and being connected in parallel

between the common fluid inlet and the common fluid outlet, the
binary lines each having therein a binary valve (24, 26, 28, 30)

and a metering means (42, 44, 46, 48) for passing a
predetermined rate of fluid flow to the common outlet, the

predetermined rates being chosen cooperatively such that
sequentially selected binary lines separately or in combination

provide for sequentially increased rates of total fluid flow in

binary lines between the common fluid inlet and the common fluid

outlet, the analog line having therein a continuously adjustable
flow rate regulator (52) for passing any selected rate of fluid flow

up to a maximum rate at least equal to the largest increment; and
controller means (58) for setting each binary valve in a selected
open or closed position, and for setting the f
low rate regulator for
a selected rate of fluid flow through the analog line, such that

cooperative settings provide for a smoothly variable and
selectable rate of total fluid flow,

an additional fluid line (102) connected in parallel with the binary lines

(20) and the common fluid outlet (22), the additional line having therein
an additional metering means (104) for passing an additional

predetermined rate of fluid flow to the common outlet, the additional line
being normally open so as to pass a minimum flow to the common fluid

outlet at the additional predetermined rate.

rate of flow not more than any of the predetermined rates for the
secondary lines.

secondary line is twice the predetermined rate for its preceding binary

predetermined rates.
The system of claim 1, wherein the binary lines comprise a primary line
and one or more secondary lines, the binary lines have a sequential

order of increasing predetermined rates, the primary line has a primary

increment equal to twice the primary rate.
