<ABSTRACT>
Transfer equipment in a simulator or a press has two transfer rails (9) which extend in the press feed direction and can be moved along two or three axes. One or more carrier rails (11, 13) are attached releasably to each transfer rail. For the change, the carrier rails (11, 13) can be deposited on deposition supports (8) of the sliding table (6). Catch and fastening means (17, 18, 20) are provided between the transfer rails (9) and the carrier rails (11, 13) and these means permit a coupling and decoupling process brought about by the movements of the carrier rails (9) along the axes.

<CLAIMS>
Transfer device for the transporting of
workpieces in simulators, presses and similar setting-up

or processing machines, having at least one
transporting rail, which extends in the path running

through the press, is movably mounted transversely with
respect to the path running through the press, in the

lifting/lowering direction and horizontally in the
transfer direction and can be driven, at least one

carrier rail (11, 13) being provided for receiving
gripping tools (12), which rail can be fixed on the

transporting rail (9, 13) by means of centring and
fastening means (17, 18, 20) for the operation of the

transfer device and can be exchanged, characterized in
that the carrier rail (11, 13) can be snap-fitted on

the sliding table (6), on setting-down supports (8),
for the exchange during a tool change, in that each of

the carrier rails (11, 13) comprises an angle section
with a web part (15) angled away in the horizontal,

into which a plurality of bolts (17) are fixedly
provided over the length of the carrier rail (11, 13),

with a vertically upward-protruding centring part, in
that a plurality of resilient bolts (20) are provided

in a vertically upright side part of the transporting
rail (9), for receiving in an upwardly open groove (21)

in the carrier rail (11, 13), and with a head part
which is wider than the groove (21), and in that on the

underside of the transporting rail (9) there is
arranged at least one resiliently mounted lug (18), 

which for the operating state engages under the web
part (15) angled away into the horizontal.
Transfer device for the transporting of
workpieces in simulators, presses and similar setting-up

or processing machines, having two transporting
rails, which extend over the path running through the

press, are movably mounted at least in the
lifting/lowering direction and horizontally in the

transfer direction and are driven, having at least one
carrier rail (11, 13) for each transporting rail (9),

it being possible for the operation of the transfer
device for the carrier rail (11, 13) to be fixed on the

transporting rails (9) by means of centring and
fastening means (17, 18, 20) and to be exchanged,

characterized in that the carrier rails (11, 13) can be
snap-fitted on the sliding table (6), on setting-down

supports (8), for the exchange during a tool change,
and are suitable for receiving one or more cross-members

(23), in that each of the carrier rails (11,
13) comprises an angle section with a web part (15)

angled away in the horizontal, into which a plurality
of bolts (17) are fixedly provided over the length of

the carrier rail (11, 13), with a vertically upward-protruding
centring part, an that a plurality of

resilient bolts (20) are provided in a vertically
upright side part of the transporting rail (9), for

receiving in an upwardly open groove (21) in the
carrier rail (11, 13), and with a head part which is

wider than the groove (21), and in that on the
underside of the transporting rail (9) there is

arranged at least one resiliently mounted lug (18),
which for the operating state engages under the web

part (15) angled away into the horizontal.
Transfer device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that setting-down supports (8) are

arranged on the sliding table (6) for the snap-fitting
of the carrier rails (11, 13) on the sliding table (6),

in that the setting-down supports (8) are assigned to
the regions of the bolts (17) on the carrier rail (11, 

13), in that the setting-down supports (8) have bars
(16) which can be moved by motor, engage behind a

formation on the bolt (17) and can be unlocked from the
latter, and at the same time interact with a resilient

lug (18) in the sense of unlocking the carrier rail
(11, 13) from the transporting rail (9).
