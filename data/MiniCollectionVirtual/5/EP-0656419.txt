<ABSTRACT>
A method of highly purifying human serum albumin (HSA) which comprises bringing a fraction containing HSA produced 
by gene manipulation into contact with a chelate chromatography carrier having copper ions combined therewith and eluting 

the HSA adsorbed on the carrier by using a buffer having a pH of 5 to 7 and containing ammonium chloride as an antagonist. 
This method can provide a highly pure HSA free from yeast-origin components which have been dificult to remove satisfactorily 

by the conventional method of purifying HSA produced by gene manipulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for highly
purifying human serum albumin, which is characterized by
subjecting human serum albumin produced by genetic engineering
to Cu-chelating chromatography.An albumin, particularly human serum albumin (hereinafter
also referred to as HSA) is an important component constituting
protein in plasma. This protein is produced in liver, and is
mainly responsible for sustaining normal osmotic pressure of
blood flow. Also, it functions as a carrier for various serum
molecules. HSA is administered in a variety of clinical
situations. For example, when HSA is administered to a patient
suffering from shock or ambustion, it functions to recover blood
volume to its original level, thereby improving some symptoms
relating to trauma. For this effect, HSA is frequently
administered. Also, patients suffering from hypoproteinemia or
fetal erythroblastosis may need treatments with HSA.As exemplified, the basic significance of HSA
administration is prominent in the treatment of symptoms
accompanying loss of fluids from blood vessels, as in surgery,
shock, burn, or hypoproteinemia which causes edema.At present, HSA is produced mainly by fractionation of
blood. This production method is uneconomical, and besides, it 
poses a problem that the supply of the blood is not always
assured. Moreover, the blood may contain undesirable
substances such as hepatitis viruses. Accordingly, the
development of a substitute raw material for HSA will be
greatly advantageous.In the meantime, the advent of the recombinant DNA
technique has enabled production of various useful polypeptides
by microorganisms, and many mammalian polypeptides have been
already produced by various kinds of microorganisms. A
technique permitting large-scale production of HSA by utilizing
genetic engineering and purification thereof is being
established.Methods for isolating and purifying HSA from plasma have
been variously studied and have seen practical application. For
example, Cohn's ethanol fractionation, PEG fractionation and
ammonium sulfate fractionation are known. In recent years, a
combined method of treatment with anion exchanger and heat
treatment at 60°C for 10 hours (Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 191226/1990), and a combined method of treatment
with anion exchanger, treatment with cation exchanger and heat
treatment at 60°C for 10 hours (Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 17123/1991) have been developed.While the purification of recombinant HSA (r-HSA) obtained
by genetic engineering
