<ABSTRACT>
The slats (1) of the shading device exhibit, in at least one of their two main surfaces (2,3), at least two undercut grooves (1e,1f) which extend over their length. Identical or different functional elements (6), which cover over at least virtually half of a main surface (2,3), can be inserted into said grooves.

<CLAIMS>
Lamella which is intended for a shade-providing 
device, comprising a multiplicity of identical lamellae, 

and which has, on at least one of its main surfaces, at 
least two undercut grooves (1e, 1f) which extend over the 

length of the lamella and into which it is possible to 
insert identical or different functional elements (6), 

which cover at least approximately half a main surface, 
characterized in that the lamella (1) is formed with a 

central part (5), extending essentially over the length 
of the lamella and projecting beyond at least one of the 

main surfaces, and has at least one of the undercut 
grooves in the form of a clearance (1f) in the central 

part (5) and at least another of the undercut grooves in 
a border web (1e) of the lamella (1), and in that the 

lamella is provided for a shade-providing device comprising 
horizontal lamellae. 
Lamella according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the central part (5) is provided with a longitudinal 

duct, it being possible to insert bearing journals (7) 
into the end-side openings of said duct. 
Lamella according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the bearing journals each have an inner section 

(7a), which can be inserted into the longitudinal duct in 
a rotationally fixed manner in different rotary-angle 

positions, and an outer section (7) which adjoins said 
inner section eccentrically. 
Lamella according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one functional element (6) 

is a reflector plate, preferably a mirror plate. 
Lamella according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that the reflector plate (6) is provided, on the surface 
facing the light incidence, on that side of the central 

part (5) which, when the lamella is in the open position, 
faces the area for which the shade is to be provided. 
Lamella according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one functional element is 

a solar cell, preferably a thin-layer solar cell. 
Lamella according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one functional element (6) 

is a heat-insulating panel or a bulletproof panel. 
Shade-providing device comprising a multiplicity 
of lamellae according to one of Claims 1 to 7. 
Shade-providing device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the lamellae (1) are held in 

horizontal alignment by way of gather-up carrying 
elements, and a pulling device which can gather up the 

screen formed from the lamellae (1) acts on the lowermost 
lamella (1). 
Shade-providing device according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the lamellae (1) can each be 

pivoted, around a stationary longitudinal axis (4), 
between a closed position and an open position and can be 

fixed in each pivot position.
