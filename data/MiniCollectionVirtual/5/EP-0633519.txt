<ABSTRACT>
Known processorsystems comprising a processor and memory fields for 
containing human computer interfaces each having a number of elements 

each representing a function are little flexible systems. The processorsystem 
according to the invention is a very flexible system, by receiving a user code 

and generating an adjustable code which is allocated to an element and which 
depends upon the user code. This adjustable code can be a transmissioncode 

representing transmission information or can be a displaycode like an elementcode 
representing a displayelement being enabled or disabled or an 

elementparameter representing a number of times a displayelement has been 
activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a processorsystem comprising a processor
and a memory field for containing a computer interface, the
computer interface comprising a display screen being able to display a
number of screen display elements, each representing a function.Such processorsystems are of common general knowledge, for
example a Personal Computer (PC) or a workstation. The computer
interface has a number of elements each representing a function, for
example an icon (function: for example file transfer), a menubar
(function: for example menu item choise), a window (function: for
example editing of text or sharing computer application data), a
videowindow (function: for example display of image) or a number of
required videowindows (function: for example required number of images
to be displayed simultaneously). The processorsystem is adapted for
displaying one or more elements directly on a screen, like four icons,
one menubar including menu-items and two videowindows, and for
displaying other elements indirectly on the screen, like two other
icons and a pull-down-menu-item (these can be displayed for example by
selecting a menu-item on the displayed menubar). Other elements are
never displayed on the screen, like the number of required videowindows.These known processorsystems are little flexible systems, which
is disadvantageous.It is an object of the invention, inter alia, to provide a more
flexible processorsystem as defined by the preamble.Thereto, the processorsystem according to the invention is
characterised in that the processorsystem comprises means for
receiving a user code from a user, and for generating adjustable
element codes in response to the user code, each adjustable code being
allocated to a display element and enabling or disabling said element
to be displayed on the screen dependent of the value of the element
code, moreover, comprising a further memory field for containing a
further computer interface comprising a further number of display
elements, each representing a function, the processorsystem being 
adapted for selecting one of the memory fields in dependence of the
user code.A user code is sent by a user to the processorsystem, for
example via a password or a smart card. In dependence of this user
code an adjustable code is generated, for example by selecting a part
of the user code or by converting a part of the user code and defining
this converted part as being the adjustable code, or by using the part
of the user code for addressing a processormemory and reading out the
ad
