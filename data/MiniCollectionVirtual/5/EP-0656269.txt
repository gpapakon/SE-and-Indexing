<ABSTRACT>
For indicating tire inflation, an essentially two-dimensional 
array of sensors is used to determine the distribution of contact 

forces over the footprint of a pneumatic tire. A neural network may 
be employed to classify the patterns of force sensed in this manner, 

and to closely estimate the actual tire inflation pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for determining 
pressure of a pneumatic tire mounted on a vehicle. Pneumatic tires for carrying vehicles should be maintained at 
the proper pressure in order to achieve optimum conditions for either 
safety, comfort, road handling, fuel economy, and longer tire wear, or 
combinations thereof. Often an under-inflated tire primarily bears its load at the 
shoulders of the tread, in which case its road-engagement pattern is 
somewhat concave between those shoulders. Under such conditions 
continued use of the tire over the road causes excessive wear at the 
shoulders, because an appropriate frictional contact in the central 
portion is not maintained. This results in less than normal lifetime 
and obviously uneven wear. Alternatively, an over-inflated tire 
sustains considerable wear in the central tread area between the 
shoulders, and less-than-normal wear at the shoulder portions. Either 
situation results in wastefulness, since the total potential of the 
tire is not being used. In other instances, there is a greater 
tendency to skid or slide. In addition, undue stresses and strains, 
particularly in the instance of under-inflation, are applied to the 
sidewalls of the tire carcass, causing it to deteriorate before its 
time. Tire manufacturers provide specifications for the operation 
of tires. Automobile manufacturers also specify tire inflation  
 
characteristics. However, both of these specifications, even if 
followed religiously, do not necessarily mean that the tire-operating 
condition is particularly correct for that tire on that vehicle. The 
ideal conditions, therefore, will be seen to exist when the air 
pressure in the particular tire is just sufficient to produce full 
road-engagement contact across the entire width of the tread, so that 
the weight of the car is borne equally in the road-engagement area 
between the shoulders and across the central portion of the tire. 
Under such circumstances the tire tread will wear evenly, and the 
tread life and maximum safety results from maximum gripping or friction 
of the tire on the roadway. In the past, vehicle operators or gas station attendants have 
to some degree relied on visual inspection of the tire under a load to 
appraise inflation. A tire wearing too much at the shoulders becomes 
bald therearound due to the under-inflation of the tire. However, 
when the bald condition is visible or observable, it may already be 
too late to do much to rectify the situation. Contrariwise, the 
over-infla

<CLAIMS>
A system for determining the pressure of a pneumatic 
vehicular tire while mounted on the wheel of a vehicle, comprising: 


an array of load sensors for providing a pattern of the force 
distribution exerted by said tire when in contact with said sensors; 
a computer which is programmed (programmed computer) to 
determine said tire inflation pressure from said data independently of 

the make or model of said tire and said vehicle; and 
means for displaying said pressure; 
 
characterized in that the array of load sensors is a two-dimensional 

array (20,24,25) for providing a two-dimensional pattern of the said 
force distribution exerted by the tire while the vehicle is moving, or 

at rest, on the array. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said load sensors 
(20,24,25) are piezoelectric and/or piezoresistance elements. 
The system of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said load 
sensors (20,24,25) are monitored in the driveway approaching or 

adjacent to a gasoline service pump. 
The system of any preceding claim, wherein said pressure 
display means is a visual display in proximity to said vehicle. 
The system of any preceding claim, wherein said computer 
determines a mean contact pressure from said force distribution data. 
The system of any preceding claim, wherein said computer 
program includes a neural network.  

 
The system of claim 6, wherein said tire pressure is 
determined by said computer by neural network recognition. 
The system of claim 7, wherein said neural network is 
trained on inputs that are insensitive to the position of tire on said 

sensors. 
The system of any one of claims 6 to 8, wherein said 
neural network is trained on pseudopressure, summation of forces, 

midpoint pressure, force-width data, or aspect ratio, or combinations 
of two or more thereof. 
The system of any preceding claim, wherein differences in 
the pattern of forces are used to indicate differences in the 

inflation pressure of tires.
