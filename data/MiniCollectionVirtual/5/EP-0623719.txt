<ABSTRACT>
In a lock cylinder (10), the keyway (16) and correspondingly also the key shank (18) each have a near-breast profile region (B) with an axis-parallel near-breast mid-plane (BM) and a near-spine profile region (R) with an axis-parallel near-spine mid-plane (RM). Notches (20) are worked into the near-breast profile region (B) from the breast edge face (18b). In the basic rotational position (key-insertion and key-withdrawal position), the near-spine mid-plane (RM) forms an acute angle (- alpha ) with the tumbler plane (Z), whilst the near-breast mid-plane (BM) coincides essentially with the tumbler plane (Z).
