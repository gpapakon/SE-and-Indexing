Method of preventing or reducing the discoloration 
of coating films which occurs after stoving 

when these films have been prepared by cathodic 
deposition of aqueous electrodeposition coating materials 

which are contaminated with transition metal ions, 
especially iron ions, and which contain as binder 


A-1 at least one cationic, amine-modified epoxy resin 
which contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-2 at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-3 a mixture of at least one cationic, amine-modified 
epoxy resin which contains active hydrogen atoms and 

at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, and as crosslinking 

agent 
B at least one aliphatic or cycloaliphatic blocked 
polyisocyanate which is part of the amine-modified 

epoxy resin or part of the cationic polyacrylate 
resin or is present as a separate component or is 

both part of the amine-modified epoxy resin and/or 
cationic polyacrylate resin and is present as a 

separate component, 
 
characterized in that at least one ester of 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 

acid and an aliphatic 
monoalcohol is incorporated into the electrodeposition 

coating materials. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butylhydroxyphenyl)propionate 

[sic] is incorporated into the electrodeposition 

coating materials.  
 
Electrodeposition coating materials which are 
contaminated with transition metal ions, especially iron 

ions, and which contain as binder 

A-1 at least one cationic, amine-modified epoxy resin 
which contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-2 at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-3 a mixture of at least one cationic, amine-modified 
epoxy resin which contains active hydrogen atoms and 

at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, and as crosslinking 

agent 
B at least one aliphatic or cycloaliphatic blocked 
polyisocyanate which is part of the amine-modified 

epoxy resin or part of the cationic polyacrylate 
resin or is present as a separate component or is 

both part of the amine-modified epoxy resin and/or 
cationic polyacrylate resin and is present as a 

separate component, 
 
characterized in that they contain at least one ester of 

3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and 
an aliphatic monoalcohol. 
Electrodeposition coating materials according to 
claim 3, characterized in that they contain octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate. 
Use of esters of 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 
acid and aliphatic monoalcohols for 

preventing or reducing the discoloration of coating films 
which occurs after stoving, when the films have been 

prepared by cathodic deposition of aqueous electrodeposition 
coating materials which are contaminated with 

transition metal ions, especially iron ions, and which 
contain as binder  

 

A-1 at least one cationic, amine-modified epoxy resin 
which contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-2 at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-3 a mixture of at least one cationic, amine-modified 
epoxy resin which contains active hydrogen atoms and 

at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, and as crosslinking 

agent 
B at least one aliphatic or cycloaliphatic blocked 
polyisocyanate which is part of the amine-modified 

epoxy resin or part of the cationic polyacrylate 
resin or is present as a separate component or is 

both part of the amine-modified epoxy resin and/or 
cationic polyacrylate resin and is present as a 

separate component. 
Use according to claim 5, characterized in that 
octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propiona
te 
is employed.
