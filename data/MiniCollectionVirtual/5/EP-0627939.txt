<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides compounds which are covalent conjugates of deferoxamine and biotin or derivatives thereof. The subject compounds are capable of binding metal ions and avidin or streptavidin, and accordingly are useful in two-step radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy. Methods for the synthesis of the deferoxamine-biotin conjugates are also provided by the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides biotin derivatives 
suitable for radiolabeling and useful in two-step 
radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy. In 
particular, the present invention is directed to 
covalent conjugates of biotin and deferoxamine which are 
stable invivo and suitable for radiolabeling. In the 
two-step approach, radiolabeled biotin derivatives are 
used to deliver radionuclides suitable for imaging and 
therapy to target-bound streptavidin or avidin 
conjugated antibodies or other cell-targeting agents. 
Radioimaging and radiotherapy utilize cell or tissue 
specific targeting agents as delivery systems for 
radioactive, paramagnetic or cytotoxic agents. Any 
agent which is specific for a lesion or site of interest 
can potentially act as a targeting agent. For example, 
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be produced 
which exhibit considerable specificity for certain cell 
or tissue types. Many other agents, including toxins 
such as diphtheria toxin, exhibit cell specificity and 
can be used to deliver diagnostic or therapeutic agents. 
The technique of delivery of monoclonal antibodies 
(MAbs) has been investigated for cancer therapy as well 
as for diagnosis of cancer, thromboembolism and cardiac 
myopathy. For successful radioimmunoimaging, sufficient 
labeled MAb must localize at the target site to provide 
enough signal for detection. Target-to-background 
ratios must be high in order to achieve adequate 
contrast between target-bound radioactivity and  
 
background levels in other organs, tissues and blood. 
A major obstacle to successful radioimmunoimaging is the 
high background activity of free circulating 
radiolabeled MAbs due to prolonged circulation and 
accumulation in liver and spleen, the normal metabolic 
sites for Abs. Furthermore, the toxic effects of high 
radiation doses must be considered in both 
radioimmunotherapy and radioimmunoimaging. Such 
obstacles are also a consideration for methods utilizing 
targeting agents other than monoclonal antibodies. To overcome such obstacles, "pre-targeting" or 
"two-step" approaches have been investigated. In the 
conventional one-step method the radionuclide is linked 
to the MAb either directly or via a bifunctional 
chelating agent. In the two-step approach the antibody 
is unlabeled. Unlabeled antibody is administered, and 
antibody which does not localise to the target site is 
allowed to clear from circulation before the 
administration of radioactivity. The radioactivity is 
then administered in a chemical form
