<ABSTRACT>
A closed package for combining a group of articles, such as beverage containers, comprises:   - a first part which consists of a central region which defines a horizontal wall and of two other sections (130, 140) which define first and second essentially vertical walls located opposite one another, - a second part (200) which is firstly separate from the first part and consists of a central region (210) which defines a further horizontal wall and of two other sections (230, 240) which define third and fourth essentially vertical walls located opposite one another and connect the first essentially vertical wall to the second essentially vertical wall, - reciprocal locking elements which are provided in the region of two opposite ends of one of the parts and in the central region of the other part.

Closed pack for collating a group of objects, such as for example beverage 
containers, which consists of a first part (100), which has a central area (110) 

that defines a horizontal panel and two other sections (130, 140) that form first 
and second panels which are essentially vertical and are located opposite each 

other, a second part (200), which is originally separate from the first part and 
which has a central area (210) that forms a further horizontal panel and two 

other sections (230, 240) that define third and fourth panels which are 
essentially vertical, are located opposite each other and connect the first 

essentially vertical panel with the second essentially vertical panel, and mutual 
locking elements (112, 262), which are provided in the area of two opposite 

ends of the one part (200) and in the central area of the other part (100), 

wherein
 each of the first and second essentially vertical panels (130, 140) is 
provided at its side edges with flaps (160), which extend inwards against the 

side edges of the said third and fourth panels (230, 240) and each of which has 
a locking opening (162) that one of the locking tabs (270a) is able to engage 

which are provided in the second part (200) close to the third / fourth 
essentially vertical panel (230, 240). 
Pack according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the central area (210) of the second part 
(200) forms a top panel of the pack, the sides of this top panel being provided 

with two flaps that form front panel sections (220), 
wherein
 flaps (250) are  
 

provided at the side edges of the third and fourth essentially vertical panels 
(230, 240) at least to some extent and keep the front panel sections (220) 

folded internally against the said third and fourth essentially vertical panels, 

wherein
 essentially triangular intermediate areas (270) are provided between 
the said flaps to form the front panel sections and the said flaps (250) to hold 

the front panel sections in position, and 
wherein
 the locking tabs (270a) are 
located as extensions to the intermediate areas (270). 
Pack according to claim 2, 
wherein
 the locking tab (270a) is defined by two 
cut lines (257a, 257b) that start from an oblique folding line (256) and extend 

to the free edge of the second part (200). 
Pack according to claim 3, 
wherein
 each of the locking openings (162) which 
the locking tabs (270a) engage is limited by a straight edge (162c) that extends 

essentially parallel to the oblique folding line (256). 
Pack according to claim 4, 
wherein
 each of the locking openings (162) is 
limited by a further straight edge (162a) that extends along a folding line (145) 

which joins the flap (160) to the essentially vertical panel (140).
