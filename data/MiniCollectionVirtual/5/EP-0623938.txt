<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
material used for various kinds of electronic parts, and
a method of manufacturing the same.A conventional magnetic material has been
manufactured in the following manner.First, ferrite raw powder is previously
sintered, thereafter, the sintered mass is crushed.
Particles obtained by the crushing operation are
thereafter compressed in metallic dies. The compact
removed from the metallic dies is sintered. Thus, the
magnetic material is obtained. However, it is a well-known
fact that the magnetic material manufactured in
the above-described manner inevitably shrinks during the
sintering process, and consequently, the magnetic
material is designed considering this shrinkage so that
it will have a slightly larger size than a desired size
when it is sintered. Therefore, after the sintering
process, the magnetic material must be cut to have the
desired size and shape. However, since the magnetic 
material after sintered is extremely hard, a cutting
blade wears considerably, and it must be replaced with a
new one frequently. As a result, the manufacturing cost
increase.Consequently, there was suggested a magnetic
material whose shrinkage during sintering was
substantially prevented so that the above-mentioned
cutting operation would not be required (cf. JP-A-1-264959).
This magnetic material is manufactured by
mixing magnetic powder with filling powder which is one
kind selected from silicon, titanium and aluminum,
compressing this mixture by metallic dies, and
thereafter sintering the compact, which has been removed
from the metallic dies, in an oxygen atmosphere or in a
nitrogen atmosphere. In the case of this conventional
magnetic material, oxidization expansion or nitrogenization
expansion of the above-mentioned filling powder can
decrease shrinkage of the magnetic material during
sintering to an extremely small degree. However,
silicon, titanium, aluminum or the like which is a non-magnetic
material is mixed in the magnetic powder, and
consequently, there arises a problem that the magnetic
property as the magnetic material is deteriorated.Thus, an objective of the invention resides in
providing a magnetic material whose dimensional change
due to sintering is small and whose magnetic property is
not deteriorated. In order to achieve the above object, according to the
invention, there is provided a magnetic material as laid down
in claim 1 and a manufacturing method as laid down in claim
16, respectively. Preferred embodiments of the invention are
claimed in the
