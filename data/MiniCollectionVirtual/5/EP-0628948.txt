<ABSTRACT>
An automatic gain controlling circuit is associated 
with magnetic heads (L1/ L2) for recording and reproducing 

pieces of video data information on a magnetic tape (MT), 
and an in-phase current component is eliminated from a 

recording current flowing into one of the magnetic heads 
(L1/ L2) through a differential amplification between two 

input voltage levels produced from the recording current 
with the in-phase current component so that a gain control 

voltage signal is free from a relative accuracy between 
circuit components (R4/R5/ R41) causative of the in-phase 

current component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated 
circuit and, more particularly, to an automatic gain 
controlling circuit for a recording and reproducing unit 
associated with a magnetic head. The automatic gain controlling circuit is 
incorporated in a recording and reproducing unit for a 
video tape recording system, and a typical example of the 
automatic gain controlling circuit is illustrated in figure 
1. The prior art automatic gain controlling circuit is 
formed from a semiconductor integrated circuit device 1 and 
discrete circuit components, i.e., resistors R1, R2 and R3, 
condensers C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6 and first and second 
heads L1 and L2, and a horizontal synchronous signal HS1, a 
shift signal SH1 for a magnetic head and a shift signal SH2 
between a recording mode and a reproducing mode are 
supplied to a controller 1a incorporated in the 
semiconductor integrated circuit device 1 for starting and 
controlling the recording/ reproducing operations.  First, description is made on the circuit arrangement 
available for the recording operation. In the recording 
mode, the controller 1a is responsive to the shift signal 
SH2 so as to enable voltage-controlled amplifiers 1b and 
1c, an adder 1d for calculating the sum of the outputs of 
the voltage-controlled amplifiers 1b and 1c and a current 
amplifier 1e. The controller 1a makes a first switching 
element SW1 open, and allows a second switching element SW2 
and a third switching element SW3 to enter into conductive 
state. At least the second and third switching elements 
SW2 and SW3 are implemented by switching transistors, 
respectively. The first voltage-controlled amplifier 1b amplifies a 
low-band converted color signal CL1 supplied to a terminal 
TR1 with a gain corresponding to a controlling voltage 
applied to a terminal TR2 Similarly, the voltage-controlled 
amplifier 1c amplifies a frequency-modulated luminance 
signal LM1 supplied to a terminal TR3. The adder 3 adds 
the output of the voltage-controlled amplifier 1b to the 
output of the voltage-controlled amplifier 1c, and the 
output signal indicative of the sum is transferred to a 
terminal TR4. A voltage-to-current convertor 1f is implemented by a  
 
series of the condenser C1 and the resistor R1, and is 
coupled in between the terminal TR4 and a terminal TR5. 
The input impedance at the terminal TR5 is much smaller 
than the impedance of the voltage-to-current converter 1f, 
and the amount of current flowing into the input node IN3 
is approximately equal to the
