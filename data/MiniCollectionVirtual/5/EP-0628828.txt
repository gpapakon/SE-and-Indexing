<ABSTRACT>
The metering device comprises a standard alternating power meter (13) and a conversion circuit (12). The conversion circuit measures the voltages (V+, V-) and the currents (I+, I-) of an installation incompatible with the operational characteristics of the meter. The conversion circuit supplies alternating voltages and currents to the meter conforming to the latter's specifications. The total power supplied to the meter is proportional, with a known scale factor, to the total power measured on the network. This device is applied to the measurement of electric power in DC networks and in AC networks of frequency and form incompatible with standard power meters.
