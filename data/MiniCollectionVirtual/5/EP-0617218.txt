<ABSTRACT>
A line connection (1) exhibits, on a knob-like temperature sensor (3), a single connection flange (10) for two connection portions (7, 8), inserted in parallel, of a capillary tube (5) and of a filling tube (6). The flange casing (15) is pressed into the gap between the connection portions (7, 8) in the manner of a tongue and groove joint, with the result that it forms connection sleeves, which are separated in the manner of goggles, but are configured in one part, and a spacer member (18) therebetween. The connection flange (10) bears a securing means (30) which is located at a distance from it and is intended for protecting the capillary tube (5) from buckling and securing it in a self-reinforcing manner against being pulled. A high degree of functional safety is thus obtained, along with compact and simple production.
