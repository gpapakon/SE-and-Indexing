<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a
porous carbon article comprising the steps of forming a workpiece
with transport porosity and forming nanopores in said
workpiece by thermochemical treatment. The invention also
relates to an article produced by said method.From "Application of tubular articles in cryoadsorption
pumps//Carbon adsorbents and their application in industries.",
Breslavets K.S et al, Moscow, Science publishers,
1983, p. 243, a method for producing a porous carbon article
is known. The method comprises a step of forming or extrusion
of a paste consisting of silicon carbide powder and commercial
synthetic resins as a binder in order to produce a desired
article. In this case, transport porosity of the material
is formed with pore size above 100 nm. Then a carbonization
in an inert medium is carried out in order to strengthen
the article and make its structure more uniform. Further the
article undergoes a thermochemical treatment by chlorine at
900 - 1000°C for transformation of carbide into carbon. In
this step, in the volume of the article a nanoporous structure
with pore size less than 10 nm is formed.Use of a polymeric resin as a binder is an obstacle for obtaining
high mechanical strength, because of the low mechanical
strength of carbonized resin. Resin destruction accompanies
formation of carbon which also takes part in the process
of forming nanoporosity, but the size of this porosity is
practically uncontrollable. As a result, it is impossible to
produce materials with predetermined adsorption properties
with the known method. An article produced by means of the known method is a carbon
material binded with products of resin carbonization with
porosity of 65 to 75 vol%. In this case, a part of the pores,
30-32 vol% are transport pores having size greater than 100
nm, while other pores have size less than 10 nm.Application of articles obtained by the known method is restricted
because it gives no possibility to obtain controllable
size of pores as well as controllable volumetric content
of both transport porosity and nanoporosity.A number of so called activated carbons with a high content
of nanoporosity is known, but the pore size distribution for
these materials is very wide and uncontrolled, c.f. "Carbon",
John Wiley & Son, N.Y. 1988,USA.It is thus a need for a method in which the porosities of a
porous carbon material which comprise two types of pores can
be controlled. The two types are pores of a size less than 10
nm providing adsorption ability and pores
