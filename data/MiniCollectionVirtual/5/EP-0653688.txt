<ABSTRACT>
A compliant hard fusing pressure roller (51) for reducing media (12) 
curl and wave in electrophotographic printers (10) as part of an improved fuser 

apparatus. The improved fuser consists of the standard components of a fuser, 
namely of a heated fuser roller (26) and one or more pressure rollers (51). The 

pressure roller (51) is constructed with a central rotation shaft (53) with a 
cylindrical deformable material (52) such as silicone rubber is formed around the 

central rotation shaft. However, a cylindrical hard outer shell (54) is formed 
around the deformable material (52). The compliant hard pressure roller exerts 

a tangential force toward the fuser roller (26). Because the outer hard shell (54) 
of the compliant hard pressure roller (51) is formed from a malleable type 

material, it provides some compliance and therefor deforms slightly from 
roundness for small, sharp errors in the fuser roller (26) or media (12). Larger 

errors such as out of roundness, or miss alignment between the compliant hard 
pressure roller (51) and the fuser roller (26), are absorbed by the cylindrical 

deformable material (52). Both the pressure (51) and heated fuser rollers (26) 
are rotated about their respective axis. The printed media (12) is compressed 

between the pressure roller (51) and the heated fuser roller (26) thereby fusing 
the image onto the printed media (12) while the media (12) is transported within 

the printer (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrophotographic printing also
known as laser printing and more particularly to an improved fusing roller for use
in the output paper path of the desk top type laser printer. This arrangement is
useful to reduce curl and wave produced by the fuser system used in these
printers.With present technology laser printing systems, it is common practice
to pass the printed media or paper with the just printed text or graphics
between a fuser roller and idler pressure roller to burn in or fuse in the text or
graphics on the media. This eliminates the possibility of smearing the media
thus enhancing the permanent nature of the generated document. As the media
leaves the surface of the photoconductive drum and transfer rollers, it is guided
into the fuser. In the fuser the media is compressed between a pressure roller
and a fuser roller. The fuser roller is heated to a temperature of about 180
degrees Celsius. At this temperature, the toner liquefies thereby fusing to the
media. To insure high print quality, the toner must be evenly fused to the
paper.To allow for machining tolerances and assembly errors in the fuser
roller itself, the pressure roller has generally been, prior to the present
invention, made of a compliant material. Because the pressure roller is made of
such material it tends to deform as it presses against the fuser roller. As the
paper passes between the fuser roller and a pressure roller, a fixed amount of
the media is held in contact with the fuser roller. This point of contact is also
known in the art as nip.While the compliant pressure roller may reduce manufacturing
tolerances in the fuser roller itself, it also tends to widen the nip width on the
printed media. If a completely non-compliant pressure roller is used, the nip
width can be reduced to a minimum. However, with this arrangement the
necessary manufacturing tolerance on the fuser assembly makes the system unmanufacturable 
in mass quantities. If the tolerances are not accounted for, the
pressure seen by the media may vary significantly both longitudinally and
laterally along the media thus, the print quality is adversely affected.As the nip width increases, the amount of the print media in contact
with the hot fuser roller increases. This translates into a proportional amount of
the print media being subjected to the curvature of the fuser roller. Thus the
print media is simultaneously exposed to high temperature and curve. As the
print media and toner cool, the media is susceptible to
