<ABSTRACT>
Antigenic and/or immunoregulatory material derived from Mycobacterium vaccae is useful in the treatment of mental diseases associated with an autoimmune reaction initiated by an infection and/or the auto immunologically mediated consequences (other than uveitis) of chronic infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of mental 
diseases associated with an autoimmune reaction which may have been 
initiated by an infection. British Specification No. 2156673 describes 
immunotherapeutic agents comprising killed cells of 
Mycobacterium vaccae. These agents are useful in the 
immunotherapy of mycobacterial disease, especially tuberculosis 
and leprosy. It is stated that use of this immunotherapeutic 
agent facilitates the removal of the persisting bacilli 
responsible for tuberculosis or leprosy which, as is well 
known, it is difficult to remove by chemotherapy alone. It is 
suggested in the specification that the immunotherapeutic agent 
is believed to act by presenting the "protective" common 
mycobacterial antigens to advantage and by containing immune 
suppressor determinants which are active in regulating 
disadvantageous immune mechanisms. As a consequence, 
"persister" bacilli are recognised by the immune system by 
their content of common mycobacterial antigens and effective 
immune mechanisms are directed against them, in the absence of 
the tissue necrotic form of immunity usually present in 
mycobacterial disease. International Patent application no. WO 85/05034 (PCT/GB85/00183) 
describes compositions for the alleviation of the symptoms of, 
and for the treatment or diagnosis of, arthritic diseases which 
comprise as active ingredient the whole organism of M. vaccae. 
It is stated that the preparations of M. vaccae are useful for 
the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and especially  
 
arthritic conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis or Reiter's syndrome. International Patent application no. WO 91/02542 (PCT/GB90/01318) 
discloses that compositions which comprise M. vaccae as active 
ingredient are useful in the treatment of other pathological 
conditions in which the patient shows an abnormally high 
proportion of agalactosyl IgG and also in the treatment of 
chronic inflammatory disorders caused or accompanied by an 
abnormally high release by macrophages of interleukin-6 and/or 
tumour necrosis factor. The specification refers in particular 
to the treatment of Crohn's disease, reactive arthritis, 
primary biliary cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, 
psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (especially when 
accompanied by Sjogren's syndrome), multiple sclerosis, 
Guillain-Barre syndrome, primary diabetes mellitus, and some 
aspects of graft rejection. International Patent application no. WO 91/01751 (PCT/GB90/01169)
