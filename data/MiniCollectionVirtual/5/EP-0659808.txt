<ABSTRACT>
According to the present specification there is 
disclosed a porous film having a number of throughholes 

extending from one side to the other side, obtained by molding 
into a sheet form a resin composition comprising an 

ethylene-α-olefin copolymer, a thermoplastic elastomer and an 
inorganic filler and then subjecting the sheet to stretching 

for orientation. Said porous film has excellent flexibility, 
stretchability and moisture permeability. These properties 

are made possible by using individual components in particular 
proportions, molding the resulting composition into a 

sheet form and then stretching the sheet to form fine throughholes 
therein so as to have a moisture permeability of 

2,000 g/m².24 hr or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous film 
having excellent flexibility, moisture permeability and 
stretchability, as well as to a process for production thereof. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
porous film which is made of a composition comprising a 
particular ethylene-α-olefin copolymer, a particular thermoplastic 
elastomer and an inorganic filler and which has 
excellent flexibility, moisture permeability and stretchability, 
as well as to a process for production thereof. The applications of porous films include a back 
sheet of disposable diaper. The porous film used in such an 
application is required to have the following properties. 
Firstly, the porous film must have good moisture permeability 
in order to prevent damp when a disposable diaper using said 
film is worn. Secondly, the porous film is required to have 
good touch and be flexible so as not to prevent the movement 
of a person wearing the paper diaper. Further, the porous 
film is required to have a small residual strain after elongation, 
i.e. good stretchability, because a porous film 
having a large residual strain does not regain its original 
size after elongation, gives no feeling of fitness, and slip 
down. Various methods have been proposed in order to 
obtain a polyolefin porous film having flexibility. The 
methods are largely divided into two methods, i.e. a method A 
which comprises adding a rubber-like component and a waxy or 
liquid component to a polyolefin resin and a method B which  
 
comprises employing a low modulus of elasticity resin as the 
matrix resin. Typical examples of the method A include the followings. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,472,328 discloses a method for 
obtaining a moisture-permeable film having flexibility by 
orientation of a film or sheet made from a composition comprising 
a linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resin, a 
filler and a waxy or liquid hydrocarbon polymer. This moisture-permeable 
film or sheet, however, has no flexibility and 
stretchability as intended by the present invention. Japanese 
Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 295649/1988 
discloses a method for obtaining a film of high strength and 
low unevenness of stretching by adding, to a linear low-density 
polyethylene, an olefin terpolymer such as ethylene-propylene-diene 
copolymer or the like. The film has flexibility 
and moisture permeability owing to the addition of an 
olefin terpolymer, but has no sufficient stretchability.
