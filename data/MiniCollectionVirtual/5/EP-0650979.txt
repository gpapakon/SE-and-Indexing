<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of free-radical-crosslinkable copolymers by polymer-analogous reaction of     A) a copolymer (A) comprising   a1) from 20 to 85 mol % of a monomer (a1) containing the methacrylic acid structural unit and a2) from 15 to 80 mol % of another free-radical-polymerising monomer (a2), where a3) from 5 to 50 mol % of the total amount of the monomers (a1) and (a2) are monomers (a3) carrying functional groups which are capable of a condensation or addition reaction,  with B) an olefinically unsaturated monomer (B) carrying a functional group which is complementary to that of the monomers (a3), characterised in that the polymer-analogous reaction is carried out at from 90 to 150 DEG C and at a mean residence time of from 3 to 20 minutes in highly concentrated solution or in bulk. The free-radical-crosslinkable copolymers which can be prepared by this process are used as binders for powder coatings (paints).

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a copolymer crosslinkable by
a free radical method and having a number average molecular

weight M
n
 of from 1500 to 10,000, by polymer-analogous reaction,
in an extruder, of


A) a copolymer (A) which is composed of


a1) from 20 to 85 mol% of a monomer (a1) having the
structural element of methacrylic acid and
a2) from 15 to 80 mol% of another monomer (a2) which undergoes
free radical polymerization,
a3) from 5 to 50 mol% of the total amount of the monomers
(a1) and (a2) being monomers (a3) which carry functional

groups and whose functional groups are capable
of undergoing a condensation or addition reaction,

with
B) an olefinically unsaturated monomer (B) which carries a
functional group which is complementary to that of the

monomers (a3),

wherein the polymer-analogous reaction is carried out at from
70 to 150°C in an average residence time of from 3 to 20 minutes,

the copolymer (A) being used in solution with a solids
content of at least 60% by weight.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polymer-analogous
reaction is carried out in a self-purging multi screw extruder. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein, in an extruder,

I. in a first zone, the copolymer (A) is fed in and transported,
II. in a second zone, the copolymer (A) is heated to 90-150°C
and the olefinically unsaturated monomer (B) is added

and is mixed homogeneously with the copolymer (A),
III.in a third zone, the homogeneous melt is freed from
volatile components and
IV. the devolatilized melt is then discharged from the extruder.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 2, wherein the
preparation of the copolymer (A) is carried out by free radical

mass or solution polymerization of the monomers (a1) to
(a3) at from 140 to 210°C in an average residence time of

from 2 to 90 minutes.
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein pigments, crosslinking
catalysts, stabilizers, dulling agents, leveling agents,

devolatilization assistants or light stabilizers are added
during the extrusion.
Use of the copolymer prepared as claimed in any of claims 1
to 5 as a crosslinkable binder component for the production

of UV-curable coatings.
