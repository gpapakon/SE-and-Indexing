<ABSTRACT>
An implant 20 comprising a specially adapted bone screw 
having a threaded shank portion 22 and a sleeve 42 which 

mates with and operates in cooperation with the threaded 
shank portion 22 is provided. Also provided is a driver 60 

specially adapted for inserting and removing the implant 20 
of the invention. A method of compressing a fracture in a 

bone is also provided. The implant 20 generates bone 
compression by itself and can be used either alone or with 

plates and washers. It is easily inserted into a fracture 
and also is easily removed from the fracture. The driver 60 

which is specially adapted to be used in combination with 
the implant 20 of the invention aids in the ease of 

insertion and removal of the implant 20.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to drivers for screws, and relates more particularly to 
a specially adapted device for inserting the implant claimed in EP-B-0574517. In the prior art, many types of screw are known. More recently, in the field of 
orthopaedics, various developments have taken place. A number of these are described in 
an article by Raymond G Tronzo MD, entitled 'Hip Nails For All Occasions', Orthopedic 
Clinics of North America - Vol 5, No 3, July 1974. However, despite these developments a 
continuing need exists for improvements in bone screws and for drivers for inserting those 
screws, in particular for bone screws that are useful for fractures in small bones. US-A-2,312,869 discloses a surgeon's bone screw driver which is provided with 
means for retaining a conventional bone screw during insertion of the screw. Only one 
driving means is provided. The bone screw implant claimed in EP-B-0574517 is a variable length implant 
comprising in a non-removably connected relationship: 
(a) a threaded shank having: (1) a distal threaded shank portion having a distal end and 
(2) a proximal threaded shank portion having a proximal end and having threading with a 
diameter d'; (b) a sleeve having a head with a diameter D larger than d' and having a distal end and a 
proximal end and having an inner threading which threads with said proximal threaded 
shank portion, resulting in an implant having a maximum implant length and a minimum 
implant length; and (c) a connector means which non-removably connects said sleeve near said distal end of 
said sleeve with said proximal threaded shank portion near said proximal end of said 
proximal threaded shank portion but which permits said sleeve to move longitudinally with 
respect to said distal threaded shank portion after said maximum implant length is reached. According to the invention, a device for inserting an implant comprises: 
(a) a inner rod having a distal rod end and a proximal rod end and having a first driver 
means positioned at said distal rod end; (b) an outer cylindrical portion having a distal cylindrical end and a proximal cylindrical 
end and having a further cylindrical portion integrally attached to said proximal cylindrical 
end and having a second driver means positioned at said distal cylindrical end; and (c) locking means for locking said proximal rod end and said proximal cylindrical end 
with respect to each other in a fixed position, in which said second driver means is proximal 
to said first driver means, as desired
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (60) for inserting an implant (20), said 
device (60) comprising: 


(a) an inner rod (64) having a distal rod end (82) and a 
proximal rod end and having a first driver means 

positioned at said distal rod end (82); 
(b) an outer cylindrical portion (74) having a distal 
cylindrical end (76) and a proximal cylindrical end 

and having a further cylindrical portion integrally 
attached to said proximal cylindrical end and having 

a second driver means (78) positioned at said distal 
cylindrical end (76); and 
(c) locking means (66, 68, 70) for locking said proximal 
rod end and said proximal cylindrical end with 

respect to each other in a fixed position, in which 
said second driver means (78) is proximal to said 

first driver means, as desired but allowing said 
outer cylindrical portion (74) to move with respect 

to said inner rod (64) when said locking means (66, 
68, 70) is not locked. 
A device (60) according to Claim 1, wherein said 
first driver means comprises a structure adapted to engage 

with a proximal end (36) of a threaded shank portion (24) of 
an implant (20). 
A device (60) according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
second driver means (78) comprises an end portion of a 

cylinder which is adapted to engage with a slot (56) in a 
proximal end of a sleeve (42) of an implant (20) and wherein 

said rod (64) fits within said cylinder. 
A device (60) according to Claim 1 which is adapted 
for inserting and removing an implant (20) having a threaded 

shank portion (24) which threads with a sleeve (42) having a 
head (52), said device (60) further comprising a handle (62); 

said first driver means fitting within said sleeve (42) of 
said implant (20) and mating with a proximal end (36) of said 

threaded shank portion (24) of said implant (20), said  
 

inner rod (64) being connected at said proximal rod end to 
said handle (62). 
A device (60) according to Claim 4, wherein said 
outer cylindrical portion (74) is adapted to house 

therewithin said inner rod (64) and said locking means (66, 
68, 70) are located at said proximal cylindrical end and are 

adapted for locking said outer cylindrical portion (74) with 
said handle (62) when desired. 
A device (60) according to Claim 4 or Claim 5, 
wherein said second driver means (78) mates with a recess 

(56) in said head (52) of said sleeve (42) of said implant 
(20).
