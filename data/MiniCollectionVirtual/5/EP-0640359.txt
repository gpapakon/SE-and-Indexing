<ABSTRACT>
A multiple sensor cardiac pacemaker 10 blends the 
outputs from a fast-reacting Activity sensor 20 and a 

slower-reacting Minute Ventilation sensor 82, 100 to 
achieve an optimally desirable pacing rate. The 

pacemaker conserves battery energy by forcing the Minute 
Ventilation sensor 82 output to be at its minimum value 

by disabling the Minute Ventilation algorithm for a 
predetermined time period when the Activity sensor is at 

its minimum observed value. Power is conserved because 
the Minute Ventilation sensor 82 and associated 

algorithms which normally consume power to operate the 
circuitry, and to measure impedance are disabled 

temporarily only during selected periods where the 
Activity sensor is at its minimum observed value, 

thereby maintaining optimal blending of the pacemaker 
sensor outputs in achieving the desired pacing rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to implanted battery
operated cardiac pacemakers employing battery energy
saving features.Rate responsive pacemaker systems are widely
available in the art. Rate responsive systems contain
means for monitoring at least one patient variable and
for determining an indicated pacing rate as a function
of such sensed pacing variable, so as to control pacing
rate optimally in terms of the patient condition. Such
rate responsive pacemakers have gained wide acceptance
as providing an improved response to the patient's
physiological needs, as compared to programmable fixed
rate pacemakers.A number of patient variables or rate control
parameters have been suggested in the technical
literature and used commercially. One physiological
parameter utilized for rate control is patient activity
level. Activity sensors have been widely utilized for
detecting the general activity level of a patient with a
pacemaker, and for controlling the pacing rate or escape
interval in response to detected activity level such as
that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,428,378 issued to
Anderson et al.Recent approaches to optimizing rate
responsiveness use dual or plural sensors, in order that
the drawbacks or deficiencies of a given sensor and/or 
algorithm may be compensated by the use of a second or
other sensors having different characteristics. This
approach is set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,527,568
issued to Rickards, which discloses switching control of
rate responsiveness from one monitored parameter to
another control parameter. There are many other
examples of multiple sensor approaches in the
literature, and reference is made to U.S. Patent Nos.
5,101,824, 4,926,863 and 4,905,697. These references
are characterized by designs which switch control from
one sensor to another, or from one algorithm to another,
depending upon monitored values of the rate control
parameters.Many rate responsive, multiple sensor cardiac
pacemakers including some of those discussed above,
achieve a reduction in energy consumption in order to
improve battery longevity, through the use of rate
optimization. In addition, energy saving circuitry
measures have reduced the pacemaker's power consumption.
The development of modern electrodes that build up very
small polarization voltages has also contributed to
reducing the energy required for pacing. In U.S. Patent
No. 4,979,507 to Heinz et al., an energy saving cardiac
pacemaker is disclosed which is based on optimizing
stimulus thresholds. EP-A-0191404 discloses a cardiac
pacema
