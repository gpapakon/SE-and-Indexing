<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process 
for recycling waste cellulosic material to 
produce a bleachable cellulosic fiber pulp. The 
invention is especially concerned with recycling waste 
corrugated paperboard. Corrugated containers are normally produced 
with linerboard and a corrugating medium. High yield 
softwood Kraft is usually the pulp used to produce 
linerboard, while high yield semi-chem hardwood is the 
normal pulp for making corrugating medium. The common 
characteristic of these pulps is their high lignin 
content. Linerboard pulps contain about 10% lignin, 
corresponding to a kappa of about 70. Corrugating 
medium pulps have about 18% lignin, corresponding to 
about 120 kappa. The lignin content of corrugated 
containers is therefore of the order of 12-14%, 
corresponding to about 90 kappa (% lignin ≅ kappa x 
0.15). Old corrugated containers (OCC) have traditionally 
been considered paper waste, which usually 
ends up in a landfill site. The extent of recycling 
of OCC for making recycled linerboard and corrugating 
medium paper products is currently at 40% at most. 
The strength of old corrugated containers, due to 
their usage and recycled fiber content, is known to be 
very low, corresponding to a viscosity of about 28 to 
32 by TAPPI T-230 Method. For reference purposes, the 
TAPPI viscosities of virgin linerboard and corrugating 
medium pulps are as high as 50 to 60. In order to increase the percentage of OCC 
which can be recycled and used in the manufacture of 
high quality linerboard, a method of delignifying OCC  
 
with oxygen in the presence of an alkali has been 
proposed by A. de Ruvo, P.A. Farnstrand and N. Hagen 
in an article presented at the 1985 TAPPI pulping 
conference. The proposed oxygen delignification of 
OCC was said to result in substantial loss of the OCC 
viscosity. As illustrated in this publication, when 
the kappa of OCC was reduced from 70 to 28, with 
oxygen delignification, the viscosity of OCC was as 
low as 265 by SCAN C15:62 method, which is equivalent 
to 3.0 by TAPPI T-230 method. Markham et al in 872 TAPPI Journal 71 (1988) 
Dec. No. 12, pages 168-174 'Oxygen bleaching of 
secondary fiber grades' describe prior chemical 
treatments for upgrading secondary fiber including 
oxygen delignification. Markham et al teach that such 
recycled fiber can be used in the manufacture of 
linerboard. In order to economically bleach high kappa 
virgin pulp rejects such as knots, shives, chops and 
partially cooked chips, U.S. -A- 4,435,249 proposes 
to delignify
