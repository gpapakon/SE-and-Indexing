<ABSTRACT>
A shroud for use in a dual inner and outer cyclonic 
vacuum cleaner (10) is described. The shroud has a 

cylindrical section (50c, 132) adjacent an inner surface 
15b, 111b) of a cyclonic container (15,111) and 

preferably comprises a combined shroud disc unit (50). 
The combined shroud and disc unit fits on the outside 

surface (20c) of the inner cyclone (20) and aids in 
removal of first and fibrous matter from the airflow in 

the outer cyclone (15). Improved airflow between the 
outer cyclone (15) and inner cyclone (20) is achieved 

because of the shroud and disc unit (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved shroud 
for a dual cyclonic cleaning apparatus. In particular, 
the present invention relates to a shroud which has a 
perforated section that is parallel with and spaced from 
the inside surface of the outer cyclone or container and 
which allows air to pass into a frusto-conically shaped 
inner cyclone without plugging the inlet openings to the 
inner cyclone within the apparatus. Cyclonic vacuum cleaning apparatus are shown in our 
US Patents Nos. 4,573,236; 4,593,429; 4,571,772; 
4,643,748; 4,826,515; 4,853,011 and 4,853,008. Our US 
Patent No. 4,853,008 describes dual cyclonic cleaning 
apparatus wherein a combined disc and shroud unit is 
mounted on the outside of the inner cyclone in order to 
retain dirt in the outer cyclone. The shroud has a 
perforated lower section adjacent and above the disc 
which is parallel to the conical outside surface of the 
cyclone. The perforated section acts as an air inlet to 
the inner cyclone while the disc retains large dirt 
particles and fibrous matter in the outer cyclone. The 
combined disc and shroud work well; however, there was a  
 
need for an improved design which would prevent the 
shroud perforations from being filled with dirt before 
the outer cyclone was full of separated dirt. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide improved cleaning apparatus wherein the 
shroud is designed to substantially reduce the tendancy 
for dirt particles and fibrous matter to obstruct the 
shroud openings leading to the inner cyclone air inlet. 
This and other objects will become increasingly apparent 
to those skilled in the art and by reference to the 
drawings. The invention provides shroud means for use in 
cleaning apparatus as set out in claim 1. The invention 
further provides cleaning apparatus as set out in claim 
18. Further advantageous features of the invention are 
set out in the dependent claims. It is unexpected that the perforated section could 
be arranged directly facing the parallel inside wall of 
the container and have a relatively close spacing of 0.6 
inches to 1.4 inches (1.5 cm to 3.6 cm) with respect to  
 
the inside wall and still be so effective in dirt 
separation. For upright vacuum cleaners as shown in 
Figures 1 and 2, the preferred diameter of the 
cylindrical section of the wall of the shroud and the 
diameter of the inside surface of the container is about 
4.3 inches and 6.4 inches (10.9 and 16.3 cm), 
respectively. For tank type vacuum cleaners as shown in 
Figure
