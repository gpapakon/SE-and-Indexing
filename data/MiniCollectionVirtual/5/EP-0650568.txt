<ABSTRACT>
An improved structure for pivotal fluid valves is disclosed wherein an elongated pivot arm (22) is pivotally mounted through a flexible, resilient corrosion-resistant diaphragm (24) that serves to support and balance the pivot arm (22) and as a frictionless pivot support. One end of the pivot arm provides modulated restriction on an orifice inside the valve chamber (14) to control the fluid flow. the opposite end of the pivot arm (22) is linked to suitable motive power (38) for actuating the pivot arm (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PIVOTAL DIAPHRAGM. FLOW CONTROL VALVEThe present invention relates generally to an improvement in pivotal fluid valve assemblies, and more particularly, to a valve assembly in which an elongated pivot arm supporting the valve head is pivotally mounted through a flexible, resilient diaphragm seal that serves to pivotally support and balance the pivot arm at its pivot axis so that the valve head can be moved into and out of contact with a valve seat.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pivotal fluid valve assemblies are well-known in the art for a large variety of applications. For example, the prior art shows valve configurations in which an elongated arm, pivotal about a ball-and-socket arrangement, is connected at its distal, interior end to a valve-sealing head located inside the valve chamber. By manipulating the proximal, exterior end of the elongated arm, the arm can be caused to pivot about an intermediate point resulting in the valve-sealing head either engaging or disengaging a valve seat forming an inlet to or outlet from inside the valve chamber. Fluid flows freely through the valve chamber when the valve head is disengaged from the valve seat, but is stopped from flowing when the valve-sealing head engages the seat so as to seal off the orifice. Representative of the prior art in this field is U.S. Patent No. 2,313,128 (Densten). The Densten patent shows a fluid control valve for a water faucet in which an elongated arm 7 (see Figs. 1-4), connected at one end to a spherical valve member 16, pivots about an intermediate semi-spherical pivot 6 that mates with a cupped washer or sealing element 5 made of rubber or similar elastic material. This is essentially a ball-and-socket arrangement which wears causing increasing mechanical tolerances which can ultimately result in the failure of the valve. Accordingly, instead of only two-directional (forward and back) pivoting, the Densten configuration permits essentially 360 degree rotation of arm 7 which, according to Densten, is advantageous because the valve element can "present a number of different surfaces to its seat and thus this valve element will not become gouged out or deformed due to repeated bearing at one point on said valve," (col. 1, lines 12-16). U.S. Pat. No. 3,785,563 (Maple) shows a shut-off device for a traveling sprinkler system. As best seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the valve portion of this device comprises an elongated arm 34, connected at one end to a spherical valve member 32, wherein arm 34 pivots about an intermediate spherical pivot 36
