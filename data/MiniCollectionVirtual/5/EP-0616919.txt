<ABSTRACT>
At a torque converter characteristic assuming unit, 
during non gear shift, gear ratio and an input shaft 

torque are assumed and also during gear shift, accessory 
torque is assumed. So as to correct the accessory torque 

a deviation between pump torque and engine torque is 
learned and this value is given to the accessory torque, 

thereby the input shaft torque can be executed and 
assumed. A drive shaft torque is obtained from a drive 

shaft torque calculating unit, a control period of the 
drive shaft torque is determined, a reference drive shaft 

torque is determined during torque control period from a 
reference drive shaft torque setting unit. A deviation 

between the reference drive shaft torque and the drive 
shaft torque is obtained from a torque deviation 

executing unit. An engine controlling unit varies the 
engine torque by controlling an ignition period so as to 

decrease substantially zero the deviation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive shaft 
torque controlling apparatus and a method therefor for 
use in a vehicle having a power transmission mechanism 
for converting a driving force from an engine through an 
automatic transmission and transmitting the driving force 
to a wheel shaft of the vehicle. The present invention relates to a drive shaft 
torque controlling apparatus and a method therefor for 
controlling a drive shaft torque for use in a vehicle in 
which an engine is connected to a multi-stepped automatic 
transmission through a torque converter, in particular 
to the drive shaft torque controlling apparatus in which 
a torque fluctuation (gear shift jolt) caused during the 
gear shift can be reduced. In a prior art technique, in an automobile 
comprising a system for converting a rotation speed of an 
engine through an automatic transmission (AT) and for 
transmitting to a wheel shaft of the automobile, using an 
input shaft speed of the automatic transmission  
 
the above converting system is controlled. In the above controlling apparatus, a disc having a 
groove which is carved at its outer periphery is mounted on 
an input shaft of the automatic transmission, a rotation 
period etc. of the groove is detected by an 
electromagnetic pickup (turbine sensor) and the input 
shaft speed of the automatic transmission is measured. 
Further, using the measured input shaft speed, the engine 
and the automatic transmission can be controlled. In this prior art technique, since it is necessary 
to provide the disc and the turbine sensor so as to 
detect the input shaft speed of the automatic 
transmission, 
the cost for manufacturing the automobile is high and the 
weight of the automobile increases. So as to overcome the above drawbacks, a 
method is considered of using the information of 
a throttle opening degree and an engine speed etc., 
several characteristic maps and further the executing 
formulas, to thereby estimate the input shaft 
speed. However, in the above stated method, when a torque 
being required for driving an engine accessory, for 
example with a compressor and an alternator of an air-conditioning 
means and a hydraulic pressure pump for use 
in a power steering etc., the accessory torque is 
changed in response to a load fluctuation of the engine.  
 
Accordingly the engine torque is 
not equal to an input torque (pump torque) of the torque 
converter. As a result, there arises the problem that the 
the lower the speed and the load operation area of 
the automobile, the
