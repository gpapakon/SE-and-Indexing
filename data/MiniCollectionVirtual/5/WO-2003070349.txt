<ABSTRACT>
A voraxial separator and analyzer apparatus includes a composite fluid passing tube (20) having an upstream rotation acceleration vane member (22) rotationally mounted within the tube (20) and oriented to deliver angular acceleration to a composite fluid within the tube (22) for separating the fluid into radially stratified component layers within the tube (22) in the order of component density and to propel the fluid through the tube (20) downstream; a first vane drive mechanism (62) drivably connected to the vane member (22); a downstream rotation maintenance member (32) rotationally mounted within the tube (20) and oriented to deliver angular acceleration to a composite fluid within the tube (22) about the tube's longitudinal axis for maintaining the rotational velocity of the fluid; and a second vane drive mechanism (62) drivably connected to the rotation maintenance vane member (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS WITH VORAXIAL SEPARATOR AND ANALYZERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention:The present invention relates generally to the field of oil reclamation devices. More specifically the present invention relates to a voraxial separator and analyzer apparatus for separating and reclaiming oil from water, such as in the aftermath of a tanker ship oil spill, and for separating and reclaiming pure water from industrial contaminants. The apparatus includes a composite fluid passing tube containing a first set of rotation vanes referred to as rotation acceleration vanes connected to vane rotation means. The set of rotation acceleration vanes is oriented to deliver angular acceleration to a composite fluid within the tube about the longitudinal axis of the tube to a given rotational speed at which the component fluids making up the composite fluid separate into radially stratified layers according to their densities. A second set of rotation vanes referred to as rotation maintenance vanes is inventively provided within the tube downstream of the rotation acceleration vanes which preferably provide just enough angular force to sustain the rotation of the stratified component fluids against the force of friction at the tube wall and against fluid viscosity, and thus to prevent turbulence resulting from transition to a lower angular speed which would result in loss of the fluid stratification.A second key feature of the present invention is the 

provision of an analyzer system including an integrated package uniting two motors with two systems . A feedback loop in communication with a computer monitor and a method of spinning fluid are provided. A tachometer is connected to the set of rotation maintenance vanes to measure fluid rotation rate, and is wired to the feedback loop. 2. Description of the Prior Art:Millions of gallons of precious fuel oil are obtained from wells each year, and yet great quantities of sludge and water often mix with this fuel oil and must be removed to make the oil usable. In some areas of the world drinking water is in short supply and must be separated from contaminants. Major sources of drinking water contamination are chemicals and particulate matter mingling with cleaning water used during metal finishing and other chemical etching processes. Separation of such contaminants represents an economic burden and more often a loss of precious drinking water. In Europe the rising cost of water and water processing plants which use existing purification methods such as
