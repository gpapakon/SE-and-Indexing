<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to compounds of formula I 

wherein the substituents have various significances. 
They can be prepared by conventional methods, e.g. coupling, substitution, 
deprotection or protection reactions. 
 
They possess interesting pharmacological properties and are thus indicated for use 
in the treatment of retroviral infections, particularly as HIV proteinase inhibitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to 4-amino-3-hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives. It concerns 
the compounds of formula I 
wherein 
A and B independently represent a bond or an optionally substituted amino acyl moiety; 
R₁represents hydrogen; an amino protecting group; or a group of formula R₅Y- wherein 
R₅ represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkinyl, aryl, 
arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heterocyclyl or heterocyclylalkyl group; and  Y represents -CO-; -NHCO-; -NHCS-; -SO₂-; -O-CO-; or -O-CS-; R₂represents the side chain of a natural amino acid; an alkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl 
or cycloalkylalkyl group; or trimethylsilylmethyl, 2-thienylmethyl or styrylmethyl; R₃represents halogen, alkyl, alkoxy or hydroxyalkoxy; and R₄represents 2(R)-hydroxyindan-1(S)-yl; (S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethyl; or 2-hydroxybenzyl 
optionally substituted in 4 position by methoxy; in free form or salt form;
 
hereinafter briefly named "the compounds of the invention". To date, there is a definite need for finding compounds which effectively inhibit 
retroviruses in a human infected by such a virus, and thus treat or prevent diseases 
caused thereby, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  One approach for effecting retroviral inhibition is the use of an inhibitor of a viral 
proteinase essential for processing viral polypeptide precursors by proteolytic maturation, 
e.g. the HIV proteinase. The compounds of the present invention are antivirally active. They inhibit the HIV 
proteinase. They have particularly beneficial pharmacological properties, especially oral 
bioavailability, making them better suited for that use than structurally similar 
compounds. R₁ preferably is hydrogen, 2-pyridylmethoxycarbonyl, benzyl-CH(OH)-carbonyl, 
phenoxymethylcarbonyl or an amino protecting group such as tert-butoxycarbonyl or 
benzyloxycarbonyl; it especially is tert-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl, even more 
preferably benzyloxycarbonyl. When A is an optionally substituted aminoacyl moiety, it preferably is an optionally 
substituted α-aminoacyl moiety such as alanine, leucine, isoleucine, asparagine, valine, 
tert-butylglycine, tert-leucine or histidine. It preferably is the optionally protected moiety 
of a natural α-amino acid, preferably of an amino acid which is a normal constitutive part 
of proteins, or tert-leucine. A especially is L-valine, L-tert-leucine or a bond, even more 
preferably L-tert-leucine. R₂ preferably is the side chain of a natural amino acid, preferably of an α-amino 
aci
