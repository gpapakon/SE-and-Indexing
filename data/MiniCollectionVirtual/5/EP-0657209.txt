<ABSTRACT>
A process for making liquid polymers by condensing 
monomers and/or oligomers, mixing them with a catalyst where 

required, and dispersing the mixture via an atomising device (16) to 
form small droplets suspended in a reaction chamber (18). The 

reagents are caused to polymerise in the dispersed state. The 
process is preferably carried out in a spray dryer (10) using an 

atomising device (16) and is particularly useful for polymerising 
organosilicon compounds by condensation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a process for
polymerisation, more particularly a process using a reactor
in which liquid polymers are formed within small droplets
after atomising monomers and/or oligomers. It is more
particularly related to the process of polymerisation which
occurs through condensation reactions, especially for
siloxane polymers.Polymerisation reactors have been known for a long
time. They generally take the form of a kettle in which
the mixing of the ingredients is easily performed. Where
continuous polymerisation units are required, tubular
systems using appropriate mixing means e.g. baffles or
kneaders, may also be used. In existing systems residence
time of the reagents may be quite extended, especially
where efficient distribution of a catalyst and heat
transfer are essential. In many systems there is also a
danger that the polymer will build up on the walls of the
reactor, thus reducing the efficiency of the unit. There
is a continuing need to provide a polymerisation process
which will allow the formation of polymers in an improved
manner.We have now found that where the reagents for the
polymerisation reaction are fed into certain reactors with
an atomising device, and caused to form small droplets in
suspension, improved polymerisation efficiency results if
the polymerisation is taking place inside the small
droplets. The present invention is restricted to those
polymerisation systems where condensation reactions occur
and a by-product is formed with higher volatility than that
of the reaction product.Atomising devices are known and have been used for a
number of applications. They are particularly known for 
coating equipment (e.g. spray guns) and for spray drying
equipment, in which a liquid composition e.g. a dispersion
or a slurry, is dried to form a powder material. Equipment
of this latter type has been used e.g. in the manufacture
of powder detergent compositions.Atomising devices have also been disclosed in
relation to polymerisation but not where liquid polymer
production is envisaged. For example U.S. specification
4,435,261 discloses a process for free radical polymerisation
of liquid monomers into thermoplastic polymers,
comprising the introduction of at least one monomer into a
chamber of a cell of an electrostatic atomising device
having a discharge spray means and injecting an electric
charge through said liquid monomer in the chamber, the
electric charge being sufficient to generate free excess
charge in the liquid monomer to initiate polymerisation of
