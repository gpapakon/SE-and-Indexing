A device for converting the rotary motion of 
an eccentric (6) driven by a motor shaft (4) into a reciprocating 

motion parallel to a first direction (y-y'), 
with a drive member (10) that converts the circular motion 

(A) of the eccentric (6) into a translational motion 
parallel to the first direction (y-y') by providing for 

relative engagement of the eccentric (6) and the drive 
member (10) by means of a drive pin (8) and a slide slot 

(12) extending transversely to the first direction (y-y'), 
and with an implement as, for example, a cutter of a 

shaving apparatus or a toothbrush of a dental cleansing 
device, which is adapted to be coupled to the drive member 

(10) directly or indirectly, with the slide slot (12) 
being bounded by at least two flexurally elastic portions 

(22, 24), and with the drive pin (8) deflecting the 
flexurally elastic portions at least in sections as the 

eccentric (6) rotates, 
characterized in that
 the flexurally 
elastic portions (22, 24) include each a non-deflectable 

first end (26, 30) and a deflectable second 
end (28, 32), so that the deflectability of each flexurally 

elastic portion (22, 24) increases progressively 
from the respective first end (
26, 30) thereof to the 
respective second end (28, 32) thereof, and that the 

flexurally elastic portions (22, 24) are arranged such 
that a respective deflectable end (28, 32) lies opposite 

a respective non-deflectable end (26, 30). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the flexurally elastic portions (22, 24) are each 
of a rod- or leaf-shaped configuration, and that the respective 

first end (26, 30) of the flexurally elastic 
portion (22, 24) is formed on the drive member (10). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the flexurally elastic portions (22, 24) are 
aligned parallel to each other, and that the second free 

ends (28, 32) of the flexurally elastic portions (22, 24) 
(22, 24) extend into opposite directions. 
A device as claimed in any one of the claims 1 
to 3, 
characterized in that
 the slide slot (12) formed 
by the flexurally elastic portions (22, 24) has one end 

thereof open.  
 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the drive member (10) is of 
a plate-shaped configuration, and that the flexurally 

elastic portions are arranged in the plane of the plate-shaped 
drive member (10). 
A device as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized 
in that
 the plate-shaped drive member (10) includes a 
cutout (14) into which the respective flexurally elastic 

portion (22, 24) extends from opposite ends of the 
cutout, such that the two flexurally elastic portions 

(22, 24) are arranged at a relative distance and extend 
parallel to each other in opposite directions. 
A device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized 
in that
 the cutout (14) is provided on the drive member 
(10) configured as a drive arm (76). 
A device as claimed in any one of the claims 1 
to 4, 
characterized in that
 the flexurally elastic portions 
(22, 24) extend out of the plane formed by the 

drive member (10). 
A device as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized 
in that
 the first flexurally elastic portion (22) extending 
away from the drive member (10) and a rigid wall 

member (50) aligned parallel thereto are provided on the 
drive member in the longitudinal direction (x-x) of the 

slide slot (12), and that at the end of the rigid wall 
member remote from the drive member (10) the second flexurally 

elastic portion (24) is provided which is parallel 
to, yet spaced from the wall member and extends in the 

direction of the drive member (10), said second portion 
lying opposite the first flexurally elastic portion (22), 

thus providing the slide slot (12) between said two flexurally 
elastic portions. 
A device as claimed in any one of the claims 1 
to 9, 
characterized in that
 the drive member (10) is a 
component part of an oscillator (18; 42; 60). 
A device as claimed in claim 10, 
characterized 
in that
 the oscillator (18; 42; 60) is formed by at least 
two elastic legs (20; 44; 58) and at least one rigid 

basic member (16; 40; 62) connecting said elastic legs, 
and that the drive member (10) is connected with said 

rigid basic member (16; 40; 62). 
A device as claimed in claim 11, 
characterized 
in that
 the drive member (10) is centrally arranged between 
the elastic legs (20; 44).  

 
A device as claimed in claim 11, 
characterized 
in that
 the drive member (10) has one side thereof 
arranged at one end of the basic member (62) outside the 

elastic legs (58). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the flexurally elastic portion(s) 
is (are) supported by a spring means. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the flexurally elastic portions 
(22, 24) are aligned such that the flexural rigidity 

increases in the acceleration area of the drive pin 
(8).
