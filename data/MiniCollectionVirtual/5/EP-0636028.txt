<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of oligonucleotide
delivery and gene therapy. In particular this invention is
directed to a self-assembling polynucleotide delivery
system comprising components aiding in the delivery of the
polynucleotide to the desired address which are associated
via noncovalent interactions with the polynucleotide. The
components of this system include DNA-masking components,
cell recognition components, charge-neutralization and
membrane-permeabilization components, and subcellular
localization components.Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a fatal recessive genetic
disease characterized by abnormalities in chloride
transport (McPherson & Dorner, 1991). The locus of the
disease has been traced to mutations in the gene encoding
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR). J.R. Riordan et al., Science (1989) 245:1066-1073;
B. Kerem et al., Science (1989) 245:1073-1080. Correction
of the underlying gene defect by complementation or
replacement of the defective CFTR is the ultimate cure for
CF. Gene therapy, the in vivo delivery and expression of
genes, is a fast-developing science that can be used to
replace defective genes.Gene therapy is already feasible. T. Friedmann,
Science (1989) 244:1275-1281; M. Bluestone, Biotechnol
(1992) 10:132-134. Systems and polymers for delivery of
polynucleotides are known in the art. P.L. Felgner, Adv
Drug Delivery Rev (1990) 5:163-187. Adenoviral vectors
have been used to transfer CFTR to the cotton rat lung in
vivo. M.A. Rosenfeld et al., Cell (1992) 68:143-155.
Although high levels of transfection in vivo have been
reported with the adenoviral vectors, non-viral delivery
systems have a number of advantages and should be 
vigorously developed. Rosenfeld et al., supra; M.A.
Rosenfeld et al., Science (1991) 252:431-434.During the past decade, a number of methods have been
developed to introduce functional genes into mammalian
cells in vitro. These techniques are applicable to gene
therapy if the target cells can be removed from the body,
treated, and the transfected cells amplified and then
returned to the patient. This option is not possible for
CF patients. At present the best in vivo transfection
efficiencies are obtained with retroviruses (Bluestone,
supra) and adenoviruses (Rosenfeld et al., supra). However
the efficiency is variable and a concern is that virus
based gene delivery might cause viral infection or cancer.
Initial human clinical trials have revealed no acute
complications of retroviral vectors but the possibility of
long-term
