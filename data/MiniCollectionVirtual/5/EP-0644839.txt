Steering device for a hovercraft having two engines (2,3) 
arranged next to each other at the stern to drive it and 

an engine to provide an air-cushion which can be generated 
below the craft, and in which a jet deflection device is 

located in the air jet downstream of the two adjacent 
engines (2,3) in order to control the direction of travel, 

characterised in that the jet deflection device comprises 
a Vee stream deflector (7) with a negative Vee arrangement 

and rudder elements (11,12) which can be operated in opposite 
directions, that the Vee stream deflector (7) is 

arranged in such a way that each engine (2,3) is assigned 
a limb of the Vee stream deflector (7), provided with a 

rudder element (11;12), which runs diagonally through the 
axis of symmetry of the respective engine (2,3), and that 

the Vee stream deflector (7) displays a middle section 
which is designed as a stabilising nose (8). 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per Claim 1, characterised 

in that the air jet of the engine (2;3) on the inside 
of the curve can be deflected both in the direction of 

the curve and upwards at the same time.  
 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per Claim 1, characterised 
in that the air jet of the engine (2;3) on the 

outside of the curve can be deflected both in the direction 
of the curve and downwards at the same time. 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per one of the prior 
Claims, characterised in that the air jet of the engine 

(2;3) on the inside of the curve can be deflected in the 
direction of the curve and upwards at the same time and/or 

that the air jet of the engine (2;3) on the outside of the 
curve can be deflected in the direction of the curve and 

downwards at the same time. 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per one of the Claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the rudder elements (11;12) 

extend across the entire diameter of the engines (2;3). 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per one of the Claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that the Vee stream deflector (7) 

is fitted directly to the exhaust diffusors of the engines 
(2;3). 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per one of the Claims 
1 to 6, characterised in that at least the roof edge-shaped 

middle section of the Vee stream deflector (7) protrudes 
beyond the contour of the hovercraft. 
Steering device for a hovercraft as per Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the bottom edges of the Vee stream 

deflector (7) blend into the side of the hovercraft bodywork 
(1) in arch form.
