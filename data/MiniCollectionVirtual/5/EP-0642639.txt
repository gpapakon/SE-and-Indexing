<DESCRIPTION>
 AN INTRAVENOUS TUBE HOLDERBackground of the Invention:This invention relates generally to the medical field and more particularly to intravenous (IV) tubes and their use. The delivery of medicines and fluids to a patient is one of most critical aspects of intensive medical treatment. This delivery is typically via the use of a intravenous feed line which communicates the therapeutic liquid (whether the liquid is saline water or medicine) from a bottle/bag to a hollow needle via a flexible tubing. The hollow needle is inserted into the patient's vein for the slow application of the therapeutic liquid.Although the procedure is well established and normally operates without flaw, there are situations which make the monitoring of these fluids and their delivery very difficult. At least three times a day the nursing staff is relieved by the next shift. Since it is the nursing staff which monitors the IV delivery, each new shift must become familiar with the multitude of patients and the variety of IV drugs being administered.A floor nurse can have responsibility for up to forty different patients, each of them having anywhere from one to eight different IV drugs being administered. Currently, adhesive tape is added to the IV tube permitting the nurse to write information about the drug and its delivery. This means though that the nurse must adjust the often curled tape so that it can be read. Additionally, if there is a variety of IV drugs being administered, their respective tubing often becomes entangled and confused. This entanglement may become life threatening if it takes the nurse time to identify which tube connects to which IV bottle. In an attempt to clear away the confusion, a variety of inventions have been developed which try to keep the tubing orderly. One such approach is described by United States Patent number 4, 160, 473, entitled "Plastic Container with Auxiliary Tube Retention Means" issued to inchell on July 10, 1979. This device wraps the IV tube around the bag/bottle to take up the slack. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not assist in marking of the IV tube. Further, this arrangement can injure the patient when the patient rolls or moves; the IV tube cannot "give" or expand so the needle is pulled out of the patient.Other approaches have attempted to secure the IV tube through the use of a clamp or support type of mechanism. Examples of these approaches include: United States Patent number DES 260, 850, entitled Medical Flexible Tube Support" issued to Greenblatt on September 22,

What is claimed is:
1. An intravenous tube holder for securing an intravenous tube, said intravenous tube holder comprising a body member having positioned along one edge thereof a plurality of clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube, a male attachment means located on a first end of said body member, and a female receptacle means for receiving said male attachment means, said female receptacle means located on an opposing second end of said body member.
2. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 1 further comprising a labeling surface on a side opposite said plurality of clip means.
3. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 2 wherein said labeling surface is textured to accept ink.
4. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 2 wherein said female receptacle is also clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube.
5. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 4 further including an orifice in said body member for totally encircling said intravenous tube.
6. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 5 wherein said body member is color-coded.
7. An intravenous tube holder for securing an intravenous tube, said intravenous tube holder comprising a body member having, a) positioned along one edge, a plurality of clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube, b) a labeling surface on a side opposite said plurality of clip means, c) a male attachment means located on a first end of said body member, and d) a female receptacle means for receiving said male attachment means, said female receptacle means located on an opposing second end of said body member.
8. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 7 wherein said labeling surface is textured to accept ink. 


 9. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 8 wherein said female receptacle is also a clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube
10. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 9 further including an orifice in said body member for totally encircling said intravenous tube.
11. The intravenous tube holder according to claim 10 wherein said body member is color-coded.
12. A gang of intravenous tube holders for securing an intravenous tube from a plurality of intravenous bottles, each of said intravenous tube holders comprising a body member having, a) positioned along one edge, a plurality of clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube, b) a labeling surface on a side opposite said plurality of clip means, c) a male attachment means located on a first end of said body member, and d) a female receptacle means for receiving said male attachment means, said female receptacle means located on an opposing second end of said body member and wherein selected ones of said male attachment means are interlocked with a female receptacle of a different intravenous tube holder.
13. The gang of intravenous tube holders according to claim 12 wherein said labeling surface is textured to accept ink.
14. The gang of intravenous tube holders according to claim 13 wherein said female receptacle is also a clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube.
15. The gang of intravenous tube holders according to claim 14 further including an orifice in said body member for totally encircling said intravenous tube.
16. The gang of intravenous tube holders according to claim 15 wherein said body member is color-coded. 


 17. An intravenous delivery system comprising: a) at least one intravenous bottle having a therapeutic fluid therein; b) a hollow needle inserted into a patient; c) an intravenous tube communicating said therapeutic fluid to said hollow needle and the patient; and, d) at least one intravenous tube holder, each of said intravenous tube holders having,
1) positioned along one edge, a plurality of clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube,
2) a labeling surface on a side opposite said plurality of clip means,
3) a male attachment means located on a first end of said body member, and 4) a female receptacle means for receiving said male attachment means, said female receptacle means located on an opposing second end of said body member.
18. The intravenous delivery system according to claim 17 wherein said labeling surface is textured to accept ink.
19. The intravenous delivery system according to claim 18 wherein said female receptacle is also a clip means for securing said body member to the intravenous tube.
20. The intravenous delivery system according to claim 19 further including an orifice in said body member for totally encircling said intravenous tube.
21. The intravenous delivery system according to claim 20 wherein said body member is color-coded based upon said therapeutic fluid.
