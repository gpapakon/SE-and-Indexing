<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for separating a blood material 
into blood components by centrifugation, wherein when 

a multiple blood bag unit including a plurality of flexible 
blood bags (a) (at least one of the flexible blood bags 

containing a blood material) liquid-tightly connected to 
at least one leukocyte-removing filter device (b) through 

flexible tubes (c) in a predetermined order is accommodated 
in a centrifuge bucket (3), at least the blood material containing 

flexible blood bag or bags are inserted in the 
centrifuge bucket (3) while placing at least the leukocyte-removing 

filter device (b) outside of the centrifuge bucket (3), 
wherein the leukocyte-removing filter device (b) is directly 

or indirectly secured relative to the rotor (2) and a center 
of the filter device (b) is located at a distance from an 

axis of the rotation shaft (1) which is smaller than a distance 
between a pivotal axis of the turning of the centrifuge 

bucket (3) and an axis of the rotation shaft (1) at a 
portion thereof which has the rotor connected thereto. A 

centrifugal apparatus for practicing the method is also 
disclosed. By the method and apparatus of the present 

invention, the centrifugal force to be applied to the 
filter device (b) is reduced to a minimum due to the location 

of the filter device (b) at a reduced distance from the 
rotation shaft (1), so that the danger of damaging or adversely 

affecting the filter device (b) due to the centrifugal 
force is extremely reduced or eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
separating a blood material into blood components by 
centrifugation. More particularly, the present invention 
is concerned with a method for separating a blood 
material into blood components by centrifugation, 
wherein a multiple blood bag unit, which includes a 
plurality of flexible blood bags (at least one of the 
flexible blood bags containing a blood material) liquid-tightly 
connected to at least one leukocyte-removing 
filter device through flexible tubes in a predetermined 
order, is accommodated in a centrifuge bucket of 
a centrifugal apparatus in which the centrifuge bucket 
is swingably attached to a rotor fixedly connected to a 
rotation shaft, and the rotation shaft is rotated to 
rotate the rotor and turn and orient the centrifuge 
bucket in a direction of a centrifugal force exerted, 
thereby performing separation of the blood material 
into blood components by centrifugation, and wherein 
when the multiple blood bag unit is accommodated in the 
centrifuge bucket, at least the blood material-containing  
 
flexible blood bag or bags are inserted in the 
centrifuge bucket while placing at least the 
leukocyte-removing filter device outside of the centrifuge 
bucket, wherein the leukocyte-removing filter 
device is directly or indirectly secured relative to 
the rotor and a center of the filter device is located 
at a distance from an axis of the rotation shaft which 
is smaller than a distance between a pivotal axis of 
the turning of the centrifuge bucket and an axis of the 
rotation shaft at a portion thereof which has the rotor 
connected thereto. The present invention is also concerned with a 
centrifugal apparatus for practicing the method of the 
present invention. By the method and apparatus of the present invention, 
the centrifugal force to be applied to the filter 
device is reduced to a minimum due to the location of 
the filter device at a reduced distance from the rotation 
shaft, so that the danger of damaging or adversely 
affecting the filter device due to the centrifugal 
force is extremely reduced or eliminated. Further, 
since the filter device is placed outside of the centrifuge 
bucket, the centrifuge bucket can have an 
enough room for accommodating the blood bags. Therefore, 
not only can insertion of the blood bags into and  
 
taking-out thereof from the centrifuge bucket be readily 
performed with no difficulty, but also, even when 
the filter device has an angular portion or a projection, 
there is no danger of
