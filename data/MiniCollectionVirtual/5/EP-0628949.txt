<ABSTRACT>
In a metal-in-gap magnetic head, a pair of magnetic 

core halves made of ferrite are arranged to oppose to each 
other, and metallic magnetic films are applied to each of 

opposing surfaces of the pair of magnetic core halves. A hard 
glass layer and a chromium layer are applied to a gap plane 

of the magnetic head as a gap layer. A gap is formed so as 
to abut on the chromium layers between a pair of the gap 

layers. The hard glass layer includes borosilicate as a main 
component and it has Vickers hardness of the same as that of 

said metallic magnetic films or less and softening temperature 
of 550 °C or higher. Thus, a magnetic head does not generate 

a spacing loss when a tape slides thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic head
used for a magnetic recording apparatus such as a video
cassette recorder, a digital audio tape recorder, a floppy
disk drive or a hard disk drive for recording and reproducing
information at a high density for a magnetic recording medium
comprising a pair of magnetic core halves made of ferrite and
arranged to oppose to each other, metallic magnetic films
being applied to each of opposing surfaces of the pair of
magnetic core halves.Previously, a magnetic head made from a ferrite is
used for a magnetic recording apparatus such as a video
cassette recorder. However, in order to record and reproduce
information at a higher density, it is needed to increase the
coercive force (hereinafter referred to as Hc) of a recording
medium, and a metal tape of Hc of 80 kA/m or higher is used
to increase coercive force. In order to avoid magnetic
saturation, a magnetic head is developed to have a part of a
magnetic core made of a metallic soft magnetic material such
as a Sendust alloy, a cobalt based super-structured alloy or
an iron-based nitride alloy having a high saturation magnetic
flux density (hereinafter referred to as Bs) and a high
magnetic permeability. In a prior art metal-in-gap (MIG) head (USP
5,001,590), a pair of metallic magnetic films of high Bs are
formed on opposing planes of magnetic cores made of ferrite
to form a gap between them. Then, SiO2 layers and barrier
layers are formed successively to cover each of the metallic
magnetic films as a main-gap layer. Then, the gap is adhered
by fusing an adhesive glass between the opposing barrier
layers abutted on each other. (As disclosed in Japanese
Patent laid open Publication No. 276410/1989, a chromium layer
as the barrier layer is preferable for suppressing the
reaction between the metallic magnetic films and SiO2.) When
a magnetic tape slides on such a magnetic head having SiO2 as
a main gap material, the metallic magnetic films are abrased
selectively on sliding planes and a space is generated
eventually between the magnetic tape and the magnetic gap.
Then, the output signals of the magnetic head decrease due
to a spacing loss caused by the selective abrasing.The US patent specification 5,155,645 discloses a magnetic head as mentioned above.
This magnetic head has a pair of magnetic core halves opposed to each other with a nonmagnetic
material posed therebetween to form a magnetic gap. A first ferromagnetic thin
film is formed on said opposing surfaces and a second ferromagnetic thin film is formed
