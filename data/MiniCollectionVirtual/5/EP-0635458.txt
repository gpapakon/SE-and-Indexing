<ABSTRACT>
Process for the purification of acidic or alkaline wastewaters and liquid crude condensates, in particular condensates from flue gases of fossil-fuelled combustion plants, of their alkaline and heavy metal and iron contaminants, in which the wastewater or liquid crude condensate is treated with the aid of a pelletized reagent which develops a basic reaction product and acid, in which reagent the reaction takes place with a homogeneous mixture containing hydroxylcarbonates and/or carbonates of metals of the second main group of the Periodic Table of the Elements, in particular magnesium salts, further iron oxide and/or aluminium oxide, of which the carbonates serve in a first neutralization stage for neutralization and separation of the heavy metal and iron contaminants contained in the wastewater or liquid condensate and the iron oxide or aluminium oxide is reacted to form iron hydroxide or aluminium hydroxide in a second reaction stage displaced with respect to time, which effects in the nascent state the back-neutralization of the wastewater or of the liquid crude condensate.
