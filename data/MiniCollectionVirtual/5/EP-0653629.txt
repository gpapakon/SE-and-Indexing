<ABSTRACT>
A photo-ablation technique is used to create apertures 
(4) in a layer (2) of electrically insulating material and 

allow electrically conducting material (3) exposed through the 
apertures to create a microelectrode. The microelectrode can 

be used for assay methods and in an assay unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method of making 
an electrode (in particular a microelectrode), an electrode 
made by the method, an assay method for the determination 
of the presence of a redox species (e.g. a heavy metal) in 
liquid carrier media using the electrode and redox species 
detection equipment designed to utilise the assay method. Microelectrodes provide many advantages in electrochemistry 
and electroanalysis (some of which are discussed 
in Wightman, R.M., Anal. Chem., 1982, 54, 2532) in particular 
the possibility of electrolysis in resistive media 
or dilute solutions, and of microanalysis with improved 
sensitivity and precision. For these reasons a great deal 
of effort has been dedicated to establish a way of fabricating 
a regular microscopic disc array electrode. Any 
proposed method of fabrication must ensure that all the 
distinctive features of individual microelectrodes are 
retained, and in addition circumvent the problems associated 
with the measurement of extremely small currents (pA-nA), 
observed for single microdisc electrodes. Many approaches have been proposed for the construction 
of a microdisc array electrode including photolithographic 
methods (see e.g. Osteryoung, J. and Hempel, 
T., J. Electrochem. Soc., 1986, 133, 757-760 and W. Siu and 
R.S.C. Cobbold, Med. & Biol. Eng., 1976, 14, 109), as well 
as the use of micropore membrane matrices (see e.g. 
Wang, J., J. Electrochem. Soc., 1988, 249, 339-345, and 
Cheng, F., Anal. Chem., 1989, 61, 762-766). The former 
approach failed because of adhesion problems between the 
insulating photoresist layer and the metal substrate. The 
latter method of fabrication was self defeating because,  
 
although the size of the pore is well characterised, the 
pore density and distribution were undefined and the 
electrode ultimately irreproducible. According to the first aspect of this invention a 
method of making a microelectrode comprising a layer of 
electrically insulating material having an array of apertures 
formed therein and electrically conducting material 
visible through the apertures, is characterised in that the 
apertures are formed by photo-ablation. Suitably the layer is a sheet of flexible plastics 
material (suitably a polyester or other polymer film) and 
the apertures are formed by photo-ablation. A particularly 
preferred form of electrode made by the method of this 
invention is a microdisc array electrode in which the 
apertures are of the same size and shape and are distributed 
over the sheet in
