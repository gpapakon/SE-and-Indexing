<ABSTRACT>
A meat skinning machine (10) has a frame (12), 
an elongated skinning blade (16) with a cutting edge 

(18), a rotatable gripping roll (20) positioned 
adjacent the blade (16), and a motor operatively 

connected to the gripping roll (20). The skinning 
machine (10) is also provided with a pivotal 

deflector plate (30) for deflecting a meat product 
upwardly as the product is fed past the blade (16). 

The angle of the deflector plate (30) is adjustable 
to accommodate different meat products and different 

operators. In one embodiment, the distance between 
the deflector plate and the skinning blade (16) is 

also adjustable. The upward deflection of the meat 
product allows the product to be flipped forwardly 

to a position in front of the skinning blade (16) 
for additional feeding past the skinning blade (16), 

without the operator reaching across the skinning 
blade (16) to pick up or grasp the meat product.

<DESCRIPTION>
Meat skinning machines adapted to remove skin 
or membrane from meat, poultry or fish products have 
long been in existence. These machines include an 
elongated skinning blade with a sharp cutting edge 
which is positioned adjacent a gripping roll having 
a plurality of teeth thereon for pulling the meat 
product towards the cutting edge of the blade. For 
certain meats, the meat product must be passed by 
the cutting edge of the blade several times to 
completely remove the skin or membrane. With prior 
art skinning machines, the operator of the meat 
skinning machine reaches over the blade after the 
first pass of the meat product, picks up the meat 
product and brings it back to the forward side of 
the blade, and turns or flips the meat product 
before the product is passed a second time over the 
skinning blade to remove additional skin or 
membrane. Such operation presents hazards to the 
operator, since the meat product is typically cold 
and operator's hands are cold, thus inhibiting the 
operator's dexterity in handling the meat product. 
Also, some meat products, such as livers, are heavy 
and hard to handle, thereby increasing the risk of 
injury to the operator. Furthermore, the physical 
characteristics of the operator, such as his or her 
height and weight, may increase the hazards due to 
stretching. More recently, rigid deflector plates have been 
employed on skinning machines to reduce the risk of 
injury to the operator. The prior art deflector  
 
plates are fixed at a specific angle relative to the 
blade, and direct the meat upwardly away from the 
blade after a portion of the meat product passes the 
cutting edge of the blade. The deflector plate thus 
allows the operator to flip the meat product, 
without grasping, to a position in front of the 
skinning blade such that the second pass of the meat 
product across the skinning blade can be more 
readily accomplished with decreased chance of injury 
to the operator. However, since the prior art 
deflector plates are not adjustable, different sized 
operators still are presented with risk of injury. 
Also, the fixed angular relationship of the 
deflector plate relative to the blade does not 
accommodate different types of meat. Therefore, a primary objective of the present 
invention is the provision of an improved meat 
skinning machine having a pivotal deflector plate. Another objective of the present invention is 
the provision of a deflector plate for a meat 
skinning machine which can be set at various angles 
relative to the

<CLAIMS>
An improved meat skinning machine having a 
frame, an elongated skinning blade with a cutting 

edge, a rotatable gripping roll positioned adjacent 
the blade, and a motor operatively connected to the 

gripping roll, the improvement comprising: an 
elongated deflector plate pivotally connected to the 

frame and having opposite forward and rearward edges 
and opposite sides, the forward edge being 

positioned closely to the blade so as to deflect 
meat upwardly after the meat engages the blade; and 

angle adjustment means for adjusting the angle of 
the deflector plate relative to the blade. 
The improved skinning machine of claim 1 
wherein the angle adjustment means includes an 

elongated rigid member on each side of the deflector 
plate, and each member having a first end pivotally 

attached to the deflector plate and a distal second 
end, the member having a plurality of slots between 

the first and second ends, and a support bar 
selectively received in one of the slots to support 

the deflector plate at a desired angle relative to 
the blade. 
The improved skinning machine of claim 1 
wherein the angle adjustment means includes an 

elongated rigid member on each side of the deflector 
plate, and each member having opposite ends, a first 

bushing connecting the first end of the member to 
 

the deflector plate, and a second bushing connecting 
the second end of the member to the frame. 
The improved skinning machine of claim 3 
wherein one of the bushings provides a pivotal 

connection and the other bushing provides a slidable 
connection to the rigid member. 
The improved skinning machine of claim 1 
further comprising space adjustment means for 

adjusting the distance between the deflector plate 
and the blade. 
The improved skinning machine of claim 5 
wherein the space adjustment means includes a bar 

connected to each side of the deflector plate, each 
bar having a slot extending perpendicular to the 

cutting edge of the blade, and fastener means 
extending through the slot and into the frame, the 

bars being movable along the slots to adjust the 
position of the deflector plate relative to the 

cutting edge of the blade. 
A method of removing membrane from a meat 
product on a meat skinning machine having a frame, 

an elongated skinning blade with a cutting edge, a 
rotatable gripping roll positioned adjacent the 

blade, a motor operatively connected to the gripping 
roll, and a deflector plate pivotally attached to 

the frame adjacent the blade, the method comprising: 
 

pivotally adjusting the angle of the deflector plate 
relative to the blade; feeding the meat product into 

the blade to remove membrane therefrom; and 
deflecting the meat product upwardly on the 

deflector plate as the meat product passes the 
blade. 
The method of claim 7 further comprising 
adjusting the distance between the deflector plate 

and the cutting edge of the blade. 
The method of claim 7 further comprising 
flipping the meat product forwardly to a position in 

front of the blade and feeding the meat product into 
the blade to remove additional membrane therefrom.
