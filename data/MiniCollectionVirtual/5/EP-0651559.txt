<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thresholding, and more particularly, to two dimensional 
slope thresholding in a hyperacuity printer. In the past, lineart, such as lines, fonts and synthetic images, etc, have been produced 
by rendering bitmaps, or binary data. If the input image had been once represented in gray, or 
multiple bit per pixel format, a thresholding scheme would have been applied to render the 
image into bitmaps shortly into the processing of the image. Thresholding typically is done by 
setting a threshold value and comparing each multi-bit pixel with that threshold and rendering 
a one bit pixel depending on whether the pixel vale was above or below the set threshold 
value. For low resolution printers, such as 300 spots per inch (spi), jaggies result on edges, 
(especially diagonal edges), defining transitions from black to white, or from white to black. It 
has also been shown that better reproduction can be obtained by using a higher resolution. 
However, as resolution increases, even though jaggies are reduced, the amount of memory 
needed to store all of the pixels increases as the square of the resolution. Therefore, a different 
way of thresholding images having high precision placement of edges, to eliminate jaggies, is 
needed. With the advent of high addressability printing as shown in US-A-5,138,339 to Curry 
et al., edge precision beyond high resolution printing at boundaries (e.g. 4800 spi) can be 
achieved with lower resolution spots (e.g. 600 spi), but these spots contained gray, or multi-bit 
per pixel information instead of binary information. Thus, multi-bit information is sent to be 
written on the photoreceptor. Therefore, the function of thresholding in such a printer would 
need to render gray data instead of typical binary data. This gray data would contain more 
fidelity than the binary data information making edge placement of thresholded images 
precise within subresolution units. Furthermore, to render this gray thresholded data, it would be useful to have 
distance information in order to be able to predict where an edge will be rendered with respect 
to current position. Therefore, slope information for a particular data point could be used for 
determining distance from the data point to the edge. In accordance with the present invention, provided is an image processing system for 
performing thresholding. The system comprising: a source of image data, where the source of 
image data provides an image value and associated two dimensional slope information for
