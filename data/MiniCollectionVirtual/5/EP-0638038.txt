<ABSTRACT>
A fastening device comprises a shaft (1) and a clamping assembly (2). The clamping assembly has an outer housing (5) shaped so as to retain the object to be clamped in position and an inner core (6) rotatably disposed within the outer housing and in threaded engagement with a hole in one end of the outer housing. A sprag plate (9) is disposed within the outer housing and located in a slot (13) in the inner core, both the inner core and the sprag plate having through holes (3) to receive the shaft. A bias spring (2) biases the sprag plate into engagement with the inner core. When the inner core is rotated in relation to the outer housing, the sprag plate pivots between a first position normal to the shaft, in which the shaft is free to move through the hole in the sprag plate, and a second position inclined relative to the shaft, in which the shaft is gripped by the sprag plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fastening device, and more 
particularly, to a device for fastening a spare wheel on to 
a vehicle. A number of problems arise when fastening the spare 
wheel of a vehicle into its storage position. It is 
advantageous to have a fixing mechanism for the wheel which 
is simple to operate as well as being quickly and easily 
detachable. At the same time, however, the device must 
provide sufficient fastening strength to prevent it from 
working loose due to the vibrations and the shocks received 
during normal operation. In addition, as the thickness of 
the hub of the spare wheel can vary according to wheel 
type, it is advantageous to provide a fastening which 
provides adequate clamping load independent of wheel hub 
thickness. US-A-4 169 687 discloses a lock for an extendable leg 
assembly, which includes a clamping device comprising a 
shaft and a clamping assembly, the clamping assembly having 
an outer housing shaped so to as retain the object to be 
clamped in position; an inner core rotatably disposed 
within the outer housing; a sprag plate disposed within the 
outer housing and located in a slot in the inner core, both 
the inner core and the sprag plate having through holes to 
receive the shaft, and a bias spring for biasing the sprag 
plate into engagement with the inner core. When the inner 
core is rotated in relation to the outer housing the sprag 
plate pivots between a first position normal to the shaft, 
in which the shaft is free to move through the hole in the 
sprag plate, and a second position inclined relative to the 
shaft, in which the shaft is gripped by the sprag plate. According to the present invention there is provided 
a fastening device, characterised in that 
   the inner core is in threaded engagement with a hole 
in one end of the outer housing. The shaft may be smooth or, alternatively, may be 
screw-threaded or annularly ribbed.  
 The shaft may be of non-circular cross section, and 
engageable with a hole of similar cross-section through the 
inner core of the clamping assembly, so that, when the 
clamping assembly is in engagement with the shaft, rotation 
of the outer housing causes pivoting of the sprag plate and 
fastens the clamping assembly to the shaft. The shaft may be fixed to the vehicle and the clamping 
assembly removable from it or, alternatively, the shaft may 
be fixed to the clamping assembly and spring loaded to 
eject when the sprag is released, the shaft having a "T" 
shaped end connectable with a support fixed to the

<CLAIMS>
A fastening device comprising a shaft (1) and a 
clamping assembly (2), the clamping assembly having: 


an outer housing (5) shaped so to as retain the object 
to be clamped in position; an inner core (6) rotatably 

disposed within the outer housing; a sprag plate (9) 
disposed within the outer housing and located in a slot 

(13) in the inner core, both the inner core and the sprag 
plate having through holes (3) to receive the shaft, and a 

bias spring (2) for biasing the sprag plate into engagement 
with the inner core, the arrangement being such that when 

the inner core is rotated in relation to the outer housing 
the sprag plate pivots between a first position normal to 

the shaft, in which the shaft is free to move through the 
hole in the sprag plate, and a second position inclined 

relative to the shaft, in which the shaft is gripped by the 
sprag plate, characterised in that 
the inner core (6) is in threaded engagement with a 
hole in one end of the outer housing (5). 
A fastening device according to claim 1, wherein the 

shaft (1) is smooth. 
A fastening device according to claim 1, wherein the 
shaft (1) is screw-threaded. 
A fastening device according to claim 1, wherein the 
shaft (1) is annularly ribbed. 
A fastening device according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the shaft (1) is of non-circular cross 

section, and is engageable with a hole of similar cross-section 
through the inner core (6) of the clamping assembly 

(2), so that, when the clamping assembly is in engagement 
with the shaft, rotation of the outer housing (5) causes  

 
pivoting of the sprag plate (9) and fastens the clamping 

assembly to the shaft. 
A fastening device according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the shaft (1) is fixed to a vehicle and the 

clamping assembly (2) removable from it. 
A fastening device according to any one of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the shaft (1) may be fixed to the clamping 

assembly (2) and spring loaded to eject when the sprag (9) 
is released, the shaft having a shaped end releasably 

connectable with a support fixed to a vehicle so that an 
initial turn of the inner core (6) locates and locks the 

shaft, and a further turn of the inner core engages the 
sprag.
