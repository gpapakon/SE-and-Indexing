<ABSTRACT>
A method of setting up and handing off calls in a mobile cellular radio system in which consideration is given to the load capacity of several types of channels. The communication system determines the available capacity of the different groups of channels in the communication system whenever a new call needs to be set up. The system then assigns the new call to the group of channels with the most available channels if the requesting mobile station is a multi-mode mobile station, or the system hands off a multi-mode mobile station from a first group of channels to a second group of channels or vice versa to create free channels for calls from single mode mobiles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cellular mobile radio
systems having channels for transmitting information between base
stations and mobile stations. More precisely, the present
invention relates to a method of setting up calls and a method of
handing off calls whereby consideration is given to the load
capacity of several types of channels.In cellular mobile radio systems, it is fundamental that a mobile
station with an established connection on a radio channel shall be
able to maintain the established connection when moving from one
cell serviced by a base station to another cell serviced by
another base station. It is also highly desirable that the mobile
station with an established connection on a radio channel shall be
able to maintain the established connection when moving within the
same cell or when the radio channel which is used is subject to
increased interference. The process by which a mobile station can
maintain an established connection when moving in a cellular
mobile radio system is generally called a handoff.In general, radio communication is only possible when the desired
information carrying radio signals have sufficient signal strength
at the receiver and are sufficiently strong relative to the noise
and interfering radio signals at the receiver. The minimum
strength, of course, depends on the particular features of the
system, e.g., the kind of modulation and the type of receiver. In
order to insure that the established connection may continue on an
intended radio channel between a mobile station and an intended
base station, the handoff procedure includes measurements of the
parameters of the radio signals at the intended base station
and/or at the mobile station. The first cellular mobile radio systems placed in public use were
analog systems typically used for speech or other types of analog
information. These systems include multiple radio channels for
transmitting analog information between bases and mobile stations
by transmitting analog modulated radio signals. In general, the
first cellular mobile radio systems had relatively large cells,
and the signal measurements in the handoff process in such systems
were performed by the base station. One such system is the Nordic
Mobile Telephone System NMT-450. Another known cellular mobile
radio system is the AMPS Mobile Radio System in the United States.
The general description of a mobile cellular radio system can be
found in a publication entitled "CMS 88 Cellular Mobile Telephone
System" published by Ericsson Telecom
