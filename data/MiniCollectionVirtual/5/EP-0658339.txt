<ABSTRACT>
A process for dyeing hair by preparing and applying to the hair an aqueous 
reaction medium comprising a dopa species, a reactive direct dye and an oxidant, said 

aqueous reaction medium optionally containing at least one hair dyeing agent selected 
from primary intermediates and couplers and also containing a buffer to maintain the pH 

in the range from 6 to 10 during the reaction, and removing said aqueous reaction medium 
from the hair within about one hour following its preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hair dyeing process employing a melanin
precursor formed by reaction of a dopa species, an oxidant and a direct dye. In addition,
the present invention concerns a method of dyeing hair wherein the melanin is generated
by the user from separately packaged reactants sold in the form of a kit. As reported, for example, in Prota, Progress in the
Chemistry of Melanins and Related Metabolites, Med. Res. Reviews,
8:525-56 (1988), melanins are naturally occurring pigments
present in hair and skin. In humans, biosynthesis takes place in
tyrosinase containing melanocytes. The tyrosinase enzyme
catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopa and its
subsequent oxidation to dopachrome. Once formed, dopachrome
undergoes a series of complex reactions in the formation of
eumelanins and phaeomelanins.Melanins provide black and deep brown pigments, and are
formed by oxidative polymerization of 5,6-dihydroxyindole derived
biogenetically during the melanogenesis. On the other hand,
phaeomelanins provide yellow to reddish brown pigmentation to
hair and are formed by oxidative polymerization of cystein-S-yl-dopas
via 1,4-benzothiazine intermediates.Synthetic 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) has been disclosed in
the prior art for use in hair and skin dyeing. For example, U.S.
2,934,396 to Charle discloses a process for dyeing hair by
contacting hair with an aqueous solution of DHI having a pH of at
most 7 for 5 to 60 minutes, followed by an application of an
aqueous solution capable of inducing oxidation and/or
polymerization of DHI.Dopa and dopamine are disclosed as hair dyeing precursors in
the process of Herlihy, U.S. Patent 4,746,322, wherein the
aqueous hair dyeing composition comprises said precursor, an
organic compound to assist dye dispersion and an iodate or
periodate. The dopa or dopamine dye precursor is present in the
aqueous hair dye composition in an amount of from about 1 to
about 100 mg/ml, preferably from about 5 to about 25 mg/ml.
Dopamine is preferred, according to Herlihy. The iodate or 
periodate is present in the composition at a concentration of 1
to about 50 mg/ml, while the dispersing agent is present in an
amount of from about 0.1 to 30% (wt./vol.). Optionally, a color
modifier can be incorporated into the aqueous composition of
Herlihy, at a level of from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/ml. pH may
be maintained between about 3 to about 7 by incorporation of an
effective amount of a buffer. According to Herlihy, the above-described
aqueous compositions disperse the dye on the
