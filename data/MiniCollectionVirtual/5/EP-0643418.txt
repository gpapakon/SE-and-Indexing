<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of a zener-diode as an integrated voltage 
limiter and stabilizer component in a flash EEPROM memory device comprises 

a step of formation of an N type lightly doped well (2) on a single-crystal 
silicon substrate (1); a step of formation of an active area (4) on the 

surface of said N type well (2); a step of growth of a thin gate oxide layer 
(5) over said active area (4); a step of implantation of a first heavy dose 

of N type dopant into said N type well (2) to obtain an N type region 
(6; 18; 19); a step of implantation of a second heavy dose, higher than said 

first heavy dose, of N type dopant into said N type region (6; 18) to obtain 
an N+ contact region (7; 20) to both the N type well (2) and said N type region 

(6; 18; 19); a step of implantation of a third heavy dose, higher than said 
first heavy dose, of P type dopant into said N type region (6; 19) to form a 

P+ region (8; 21). 
The N+ region (7; 20) is of annular shape. The zener-diode can also be gated. 
All manufacturing steps for the zener-diode correspond to manufacturing steps 

of the flash EEPROM memory device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
manufacture of an integrated voltage limiter and stabilizer in
flash EEPROM memory devices.Electrically erasable and programmable memory devices, such
as EEPROM and flash EEPROM, must handle and control relatively
high internal voltages, assuring at the same time a high degree
of stability: in order to accomplish a programming or an
erasing operation, a voltage of 12V or more must in fact be
supplied to the memory cells.It is therefore advisable to provide such devices with
integrated components suitable to both limit any possible
overvoltage, which could damage the memory cells or the
circuitry connected to them, and stabilize internal voltages
against temperature variations and statistical distribution of
the process parameters. These components become essential for
memory devices belonging to particular logic families, such as
5V-only devices, wherein the voltage necessary for programming
and erasing the memory cells is generated internally.Integrated voltage limiters are commonly obtained in MOS
devices by means of chains of reverse-biased planar junction
diodes or diode-connected MOS transistors. Both these solutions
have drawbacks: in the case of a chain of reverse-biased
junction diodes the overall clamping voltage, even if it shows
a small dependence on the temperature and on the process
parameters, is affected by a decrease with time due to the
injection of charge in the oxide layer covering the junction 
surface (walk-out phenomenon); in the case of a chain of
diode-connected MOS transistors, instead, the overall clamping
voltage depends on both the temperature and the variations of
the process parameters due to their statistical distribution.In the European Patent Application No. 0426241 there is
described a process for the manufacture of a zener diode to
limit and stabilize the programming voltage supplied to EEPROM
memory cells, suitable to be integrated with the EEPROM memory
cells in a single chip. Such process does not involve
additional steps with respect to those usually necessary for
the accomplishment of EEPROM memory cells: the junction
subjected to break down is constituted by a P+ region with
dopant concentration of 1020 atoms/cm3 obtained in a process
step corresponding to the implantation of source and drain
areas of the P-channel transistors, and by an N- region with
dopant concentration of 1019 atoms/cm3 obtained in a process
step corresponding to the implantation of condensers of the
EEPROM cells; this last step requires a
