<ABSTRACT>
The thin-film magnetic head has one (3) of thin-film magnetic cores 
(2,3) stacked on a substrate (1) and formed of two magnetic films (6,7) 

and a non-magnetic film (8) held between them with a current flowing 
through the thin-film magnetic core in the direction of hard axis 

thereof. The magnetoresistance effect magnetic head has one of a pair of 
shield cores (14,15) having a magnetoresistive element (13) between them 

formed of two magnetic films (14a,14b) and a non-magnetic film (14c) 
held between them the magnetoresistive element (13) being electrically 

connected (17a,17b) to the shield core, with a sense current flowing 
through the shield core. The current flowing through the one shield core 

via the magnetoresistive element is preferably an AC of decrement 
amplitude for demagnetizing the shield core along with a DC sense 

current. Also, this current preferably flows in the direction of hard 
axis of the shield core so that magnetic properties of the shield core 

are stabilized or demagnetized by the magnetic field generated in the 
direction of easy axis. The MR inductive head has a second thin-film 

magnetic core as a common magnetic body of an MR head and an inductive 
head on one substrate, formed of two magnetic films and a non-magnetic 

film held between them with a currect flowing through the second 
thin-film magnetic core in the direction of hard axis thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
magnetoresistance effect magnetic head and a composite magnetic
head which are suitably adapted for recording and reproducing
information signals into and from, for example, a hard disk.A magnetoresistance effect magnetic head, hereinafter
referred to as an MR head, has its magnetic sensor formed of a
magnetic thin film having magnetoresistance effect. Since
resistivity of the magnetic thin film is changed in accordance
with a signal magnetic field based on magnetic recording into a
magnetic recording medium, the magnetic sensor detects the change
in resistivity as a reproduction output voltage from a sense
current flowing through the magnetic thin film.Such an MR head has characteristics, such as, high output,
low crosstalk and velocity-independence, and is therefore used
as a reproducing head for a hard disk drive (HDD) or as a high
density recording/reproducing head for a digital audio tape
recorder.This MR head is exemplified by an MR head of shield
structure as shown in Fig.1.The shield MR head 100 of Fig.1 has an MR element 101, which 
is formed of a single-layer or multi-layer magnetic thin film
having magnetoresistance effect and is arranged in a space
forming a predetermined reproduction gap GR between an upper
(layer) shield core 102 and a lower (layer) shield core 103. The
MR element 101 is electrically connected with a pair of
electrodes 105a, 105b for causing a direct current as the sense
current to flow and for outputting the change in resistivity as
a change in voltage.Between the electrodes 105a, 105b, a bias conductor 104 for
applying a bias magnetic field to the MR element 101 is provided,
traversing the MR element 101. For the shield cores 102, 103 of
the shield MR head 100, a single bulk magnetic body, a single-layer
plating film or a single-layer sputtered film is used.An example of a composite magnetic head, produced by
combining an MR head with a recording head formed of an inductive
thin-film magnetic head, is shown in Fig. 2. The inductive thin-film
magnetic head and the composite magnetic head are
hereinafter referred to as an inductive head and an MR inductive
head, respectively. Since the MR head in this case has the
structure similar to that of the example in Fig.1, the
corresponding parts are denoted by the same reference numerals
and will not be explained further.In Fig. 2, a magnetic core 106 is provided on the upper
shield core 102 of the MR head with a predetermined recording gap
GW between them, and a spiral head winding 107 is provided,
