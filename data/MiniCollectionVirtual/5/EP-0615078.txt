<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for detecting the position of a manual control 
member in particular a control lever for a servo-assisted 
gearbox for a motor vehicle. A system for detecting the 
position of a manually operable control member which can 
assume a plurality of predefined discrete positions, 
particularly for detecting the position of the control 
lever of a servo-assisted gearbox for a motor vehicle, 
comprising 
a supply and decoder unit having a plurality of 
terminals and a corresponding plurality of first circuit 
branches connected between a respective terminal of the 
unit and a first pole of a voltage source and including 
respective resistors; and position signal generator means associated with the 
said control member and having a plurality of ordered 
outputs connected to the terminals of the said unit by 
respective connection conductors; the arrangement being such that the voltages present 
in operation at the terminals of the said unit allow 
discrimination of the instantaneous position of the control 
member,  
is known from US-A-4 373 619. In this 
prior art system the position generator means comprise nine 
outputs and the decoder unit comprises an expander which 
converts the voltages present at the nine terminals into a 
four bit code for the operation of the gearbox. No description 
is given on the structures of the position generator 
means which provide the signals indicative of the range 
selected through the manual control lever. A system according to the invention is characterised in 
the features as claimed in claim 1; therein,  
 
the said position signal generator means include a 
plurality of second circuit branches each of which is 
connected between a respective output and the second pole 
of the said voltage source and include a switch the 
open/closed condition of which is controlled by the said 
control member; each position of the said control member 
corresponds to predetermined pairs of switches being 
simultaneously closed; 
respective by-pass resistors are connected in 
parallel to the said switches; and at least one further resistor is interposed between 
the said by-pass resistors and the second pole of the 
voltage source. In a first embodiment a single further resistor is 
positioned between the by-pass resistors and the second 
pole of the voltage source. In a variant embodiment respective further resistors having 
the same resistance are located between the by-pass 
resistors and the second pole of the voltage source. Further
