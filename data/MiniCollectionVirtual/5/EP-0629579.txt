<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the treatment of natural apatites with a view to using them for storing irradiated (spent) fuel elements. This process consists in bringing a natural apatite powder into contact with an acidic aqueous solution, for example dilute HNO3 or HCl, for a few seconds to 10 minutes. Thus, the physicochemical properties of natural apatite are improved by modifying its surface composition in order to make it similar to that of hydroxyapatite. This modified apatite can be used as a filling (padding) material in containers for the storage of irradiated fuel elements.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an apatite powder obtained by contacting a natural apatite
powder with an aqueous acid solution having a pH exceeding 1 for a few

seconds to 10 minutes, as the filling material in a storage container for
irradiated nuclear fuel elements or as a chemical barrier in the conditioning

of a nuclear waste.
Use according to claim 1, characterized in that the pH of the acid
aqueous solution is between 1 and 4.
Use according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
the acid aqueous solution is a nitric acid or hydrochloric acid solution.
Use according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the natural apatite is dahlite or francolite.
Use according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the natural apatite powder is obtained by crushing a natural apatite,

followed by washing with water and drying.
Use according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
the natural apatite powder treated by the acid aqueous solution then

undergoes washing with water and drying before being used as a filling
material for a storage container for irradiated nuclear fuel elements.
