<ABSTRACT>
A hair and body washing product contains a combination of at least one determined nitrogen-free thickener with a mixture of surface-active agents constituted of alkyl ether sulphate, ethoxylated sulphosuccinic acid semi-ester and alkyl ether carboxylate or alkaline polyglucoside. This hair and body washing product is characterized by a remarkable skin tolerability, besides good washing and cleaning properties.
