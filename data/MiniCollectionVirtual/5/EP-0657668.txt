<ABSTRACT>
In a method for controlling drive units of motor vehicles:     a) the maximum engine power characteristic (a) is determined, b) a reference power characteristic which acts as the minimum engine power characteristic (b) is given by the variation of the resistance to motion as a function of the vehicle speed given an average loading of the motor vehicle, c) a travelling-speed-dependent first power characteristic (c) is defined above the reference power characteristic (b) and this first power characteristic is assigned a minimum weighting, d) a travelling-speed-dependent second power characteristic (d) is defined between the first power characteristic and the maximum engine power characteristic and this second power characteristic is assigned a maximum weighting,   e) the current engine power is determined, f) a current weighting is determined by comparison of the current engine power with the first power characteristic (c) and the second power characteristic (d). g) The continuously determined current weighting values are filtered with respect to time to give filtered weighting values and h) the filtered weighting values are used to select parameters or parameter sets for controlling the drive unit.

Method for controlling the drive unit of motor vehicles, 
comprising the method steps: 


a) the maximum engine power characteristic (P
max
) is 
determined, 
b) a reference power characteristic (P
ref
) is predetermined 
as the minimum engine power characteristic on the basis of 

the dependency of the road resistance value on the vehicle 
speed with an average vehicle kerb weight, 
c) a running speed-dependent first power characteristic (P
E
) 
is defined above the reference power characteristic (P
ref
), 
and a minimum rating number (BZ
min
) is associated with this 
first characteristic, 
d) a running-speed dependent second power characteristic 
(P
S
) is defined between the first power characteristic (P
E
) 
and the maximum engine power characteristic (P
max
), and a 
maximum rating number (BZ
max
) is associated with this second 
characteristic, 
e) the actual engine power (P
Mot
) is determined, 
f) an actual rating number (BZ
a
) is established by comparing 
the actual engine power (P
Mot
) with the first power 
characteristic (F
E
) and the second power characteristic 
(P
s
), 
g) the continuously established actual rating numbers (BZ
a
) 
are filtered in time and filtered rating numbers (BZ
f
) are 
hereby obtained, 
h) parameters or sets of parameters for controlling the 
drive unit are established on the basis of the filtered 

rating numbers (BZ
f
). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that an 
economy power characteristic (P
E
) is defined as first power 
characteristic and a sports power characteristic (P
S
) is 
defined as second power characteristic in accordance with 

the vehicle type, consumption criteria and economy criteria. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the actual rating numbers (BZ
a
) are established through an 
interpolation between the maximum rating number (BZ
max
) and 
the minimum rating number (BZ
min
). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
at least one additional power characteristic is defined 

between the first power characteristic (P
E
) and the second 
power characteristic (P
S
), and that the actual rating 
numbers (BZ
a
) are established with the use of the additional 
power characteristic(s). 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the time behaviour when filtering the 

actual rating numbers (BZ
a
) is predetermined in accordance 
with the desired running characteristic (S, E). 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that characteristics or families of 

characteristics are established as sets of parameters for 
controlling the drive unit. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that engine 
speed-dependent families of characteristics are used as sets 

of parameters for the gear control. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that gear 
ratio-dependent families of characteristics are used as sets 

of parameters for the gear control.
