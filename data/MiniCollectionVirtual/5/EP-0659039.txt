<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
a printed-wiring board making use of an ultraviolet-curing
composition.More particularly, this invention is concerned
with printed-wiring board processing in which, in
forming a copper printed-wiring pattern, a resist
pattern for etching a copper-clad laminate is directly
drawn on copper foil by ink-jet printing.A process wherein an etching resist pattern is formed
on a copper foil by ink-jet printing is known from DE-A-37 40 149.In conventional subtractive processes used in
printed-wiring board processing, wiring patterns are
formed by preparing pattern films by means of a laser
plotter in accordance with wiring pattern data
outputted from a CAD (computer-aided design system),
and etching copper foil by using a resist ink or a dry
film resist.In such conventional processes, it is
necessary to first form a pattern film, and to prepare
a printing plate in the case when a resist ink is used 
or to take the steps of lamination, exposure and
development in the case when a dry film resist is
used.Such methods currently used can be said to be
a method in which the digitized wiring data are
returned to an analogic image forming step. Screen
printing has a limit to work size because of the
printing precision of the plate. The dry film process
is a photographic process and, though promising a high
precision, requires many steps, inevitably resulting
in a reasonably high cost especially for the
manufacture in small lot.Known compositions containing an ultraviolet-polymerizable
material are disclosed in, e.g.,
