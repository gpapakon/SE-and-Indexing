Front lifting device, for an agricultural tractor 
or the like, making it possible to hitch a tool to the 

front of the tractor for the purpose of raising and/or 
lowering it, comprising a framework (4, 104) intended to 

be fixed to the chassis of the tractor, the said framework 
being equipped, at the bottom, with lower securing 

means (A), extending forward articulated about a transverse 
spindle and at the ends of which the bottom two 

fastening points of a tool can be fastened, and, at the 
top, with a middle upper securing means (16) for connection 

with a third fastening point of the tool, and 
lifting means (14), particularly hydraulic ones, provided 

between the framework (4, 104) and the lower securing 
means in order to provide the ascending or descending 

movements, the lower securing means (A) comprising, on 
the one hand, a primary lower structure (19) articulated, 

at its rear part, to a transverse spindle (18) carried by 
the framework (4, 104), and equipped toward the front 

with two lateral longitudinal extensions (20, 21) in each 
of which is provided a transverse bearing (25, 26) and, 

on the other hand, a forearm (28, 29) associated with 
each longitudinal extension (20, 21) and articulated 

about a spindle (33, 34) carried by the abovementioned 
bearing, the assembly being such that in the working 

position the forearm (28, 29) extends the lateral extension 
forward, the said forearm extending, toward the 

rear, beyond its articulation spindle, it being possible 
for this forearm (28, 29), when it is devoid of any load, 

to be folded upward relative to the framework (4, 104) 
for a storage position, a fixed locking of the forearms 

(28, 29) in the top position being provided, 
characterized 
in that
 the lifting means (14) are joined to the 
lower structure (19) and to the framework (4, 104), that 

the two forearms (28, 29) are independent of one another, 
that each forearm (28, 29) comes to bear via its rear 

part, when it is in the working position, under a limit 
stop (39, 40) integral with the structure (19) so as to 

be blocked during the lifting of the structure and the  
 

raising of a load, and that the stationary locking of the 
forearms (28, 29) in the top position of the structure 

(19) makes it possible to prevent a movement of the 
structure (19) even if the operator, through carelessness, 

commands the lifting means (14). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the framework (4) includes means (V) for locking the 

forearms (28, 29) of the structure (19) in the top 
position, by combination of the upward movement of the 

primary mobile lower structure (19), folding the forearms 
(28, 29) upward relative to the structure, and 

fastening the forearms (28, 29) to a support and locking 
member (45) provided on the framework (4). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the support and locking member is made up of a 

stub (45). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the end of the forearms (28, 29) is fastened to the 

stub (45). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that in order to
 lock the device when it is not in use 
the framework (104) includes, at the top, bearings (47, 

48) similar to those (25, 26) carried by the extensions 
(20, 21) of the lower structure (19), these bearings 

(47, 48) being equipped, when the assembly is in the 
working position, with auxiliary spindles (49, 50) 

similar to those (33, 34) of the forearms, equipped with 
prolongations (51, 52) longer than those (35, 36) of the 

forearms, the assembly being such that for locking of the 
forearms (28, 29) in the top position of the lower 

structure (19), the auxiliary spindles (49, 50) of the 
bearings of the framework (104) are withdrawn from these 

bearings (47, 48), whereas the forearms (28, 29) are 
removed from the extensions (20, 21) and turned round so 

as to be placed inside the framework (104) with their 
spindles (33, 34) received in the top bearings (47, 48) 

of the framework, whereas the auxiliary spindles (49, 50) 
are mounted in the bearings (25, 26) of the lateral 

extensions (20, 21) with their prolongations (51, 52)  
 

pointed inward, the assembly being such that the ends of 
the forearms (28, 29) become fastened to the prolongations 

of the said auxiliary spindles when the lower 
structure (19) is lifted. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 5, characterized 
in that each lateral extension (20, 21) comprises two 

members (20
a
, 20
b
; 21
a
, 21
b
) separated by a space in 
which there is received a joining member (22, 23) constituting 

one end of the lifting means (14), this member 
being joined to the extension by a spindle (24) passing 

through openings provided in the members, whereas the 
bearing provided at the end of the lateral extension is 

made up of a bush (25, 26) of transverse axis. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the articulation spindle (33, 34) for each forearm 

(28, 29) is fixed to the latter so that it can be 
inserted rapidly into the bearing (25, 26) of the corresponding 

extension, without tooling, the arm (28, 29) 
being situated outside the extension (20, 21). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the spindle (33, 34) fixed to each forearm (28, 29) 

includes a prolongation (35, 36) of smaller diameter 
intended to be located between the extensions (20, 21) of 

the structure when the arm is mounted, it being possible 
for this prolongation to serve, if need be, for fastening 

accessories, particularly for fastening a weight holder. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the prolongation (35, 36) is equipped with 

means (37, 37
a

of washers (38), in the axial direction of this bearing. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the prolongation (35, 36) of each spindle (33, 34) 

has a reduced length so that there is enough space 
between the facing ends of the prolongations, when the 

two forearms (28, 29) are mounted, for the passage of a 
mechanical transmission from the front power take-off (F) 

of the tractor.  
 
Device according to Claim 1 or 5, characterized 
in that each forearm (28, 29) includes, toward its rear 

end, a peg (41) orientated substantially orthogonally to 
the longitudinal direction of the forearm and situated 

beyond the articulation spindle (33, 34) of the forearm, 
this peg (41) being capable of passing through an opening 

(42) provided in a limit stop (39, 40) integral with 
the structure (19), and situated above the rear part of 

the forearm. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the peg (41) receives a set of washers (44) of 

variable thickness and is equipped with means (43, 43
a
) 
for stopping the oscillation of the forearm so as to 

allow various possible settings for this forearm (28, 
29), namely oscillating, fixed, or with forced inclination. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the means (37, 37
a
) for stopping the spindle (33, 
34) of a forearm (28, 29) relative to the bearing (25, 

26) are set out so as to allow rapid unlocking of the 
forearm for the purpose of transverse sliding so that 

when the forearm (28, 29) is equipped at its end with a 
ball joint (32) for the bore, it is possible, by transverse 

sliding, to bring the bore of this ball joint to 
face a stub (45) carried by the framework (4) in the top 

storage position, and, by sliding in the opposite direction, 
to engage the stub (45) in the bore of the said 

ball joint in order to provide locking in the storage 
position.
