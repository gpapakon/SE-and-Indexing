The present invention relates to the identification of yeast strains 
by way of application of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify 

nucleic acid sequences characteristic of their TY transposon long 
terminal repeats. Polymerase chain reaction product is analysed, 

conveniently by agarose gel electrophoresis, and its nature related to 
the presence of a particular yeast strain or strain type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the identification of yeast strains
by way of nucleic acid sequences which vary in their frequency of
occurrence and distribution from strain to strain. In particular the
present invention provides for the polymerase chain reaction
amplification of these characteristic sequences such that the nature
of amplified nucleic acid product will depend upon the particular
strain or mixture of strains under investigation.The genetic fingerprinting of yeasts is a technique which should,
inter alia, offer the yeast supply industry, the fermenting industry
and others making yeast derived products the ability to monitor their
strains for variation and thus improve their quality assurance. Such
variations might have deleterious effect upon the quality of products
and thus it is vital that a yeast strain can be identified and
differentiated from any contaminant yeast strains. Ideally such
technique should identify characteristics which vary in a stable
manner from strain to strain. A number of approaches have been used
to tackle this problem, for example RFLP gene mapping (Panchal et
al.,1987), TAFE (Petering et al.,1988) and OFAGE (Takata et al.,1989)
which identify differences in chromosomal length.More recently Walmsley et al. (1989) used probes to the telomere
regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to differentiate between closely
related strains, a method that works outside Saccharomyces species,
while Van Vuuren and Van der Meer (1987) have used protein
electrophoresis to give characteristic patterns. These and the above
methods are costly in time and materials and limit the number of
samples which can be processed.The present inventors have exploited a different approach based upon
characteristic TY regions of the yeast DNA. In 1979 Cameron et al.
showed that the transposon TYl exists in about 35 copies in the
haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that its distribution 
showed some strain to strain variation. It was also shown that the
terminal repeats (delta sequences) of the transposon occur
independently at a rate of approximately 100 copies per haploid
genome. These "solo" deltas were thought to be the result of
previous transposition events where the central part of the TY
element has been lost through homologous recombination and the
delta sequence remains as a "footprint". In Molecular & Cellular
Biology (1984) Vol. 4, no. 2 p 329-339, Klein et al also noted that
the number and location of TY elements varied between strains.The terminal delta sequences from TY1 and

<CLAIMS>
A method for characterising a yeast as being of a particular
strain or strain type comprising:


(a) carrying out a polymerase chain reaction using the nucleic acid of
the yeast as the reaction template and one or more oligonucleotide

primers which are each targeted at nucleic acid sequences
characteristic of the yeast genomic DNA,
(b) analyzing the reaction product from (a) and relating the nature of
that to the presence of a particular strain or strain types,

characterised in that the sequences characteristic of the yeast
genomic DNA are present in yeast TY transposon long terminal

repeats and the primers are selected such that they lead to production
of amplified DNA corresponding to DNA sequences running from one TY

transposon long terminal repeat to another, wherein the number and/or
nature of amplified DNA products varies from strain to strain.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the primers are targeted at
DNA of one or more of SEQ ID No 1, SEQ ID No 2, SEQ ID No 5 and SEQ ID

No 6.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the primers are selected
from the group consisting of SEQ ID No 3, SEQ ID No 4, SEQ ID no 7,

and SEQ ID No 8.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein four or
more primers are used and two hybridize with each of the TY sequences.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein one or
more further oligonucleotide primers are targeted at further sequences

characteristic of the yeast genome. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the yeast
nucleic acid is provided in the form of a yeast sample which has been

resuspended in sterile water, whereby yeast cells are lysed by the
temperature cycling of the PCR, and the nucleic acid is released into

the PCR reaction mixture.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the
polymerase chain reaction is carried out by mixing the resuspended

sample with all the other reaction components, covering the mixture
with a sterile oil overlay and then subjecting it to cycles of

temperature suitable for denaturing duplexes, for annealing of primers
and for primer extension to produce oligonucleotide fragments.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the cycles
of temperature comprise primer annealing periods at between 45째C and

62째C.
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the primer annealing
period temperature is between 50째C and 55째C.
A kit for the characterisation of yeast strains by the method of
any one of claims 1 to 9, comprising one or more oligonucleotide

polymerase chain reaction primers comprising nucleotide sequences
