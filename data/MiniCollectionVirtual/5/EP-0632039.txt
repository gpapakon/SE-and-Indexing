<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carbapenem
antibiotics and, more particularly, to 1β-methyl-carbapenem
derivatives having a methyl group introduced at the
1-position and [1-(1,3-thiazolin-2-yl)azetidin-3-yl]thio
group introduced at the 2-position of the carbapenem
skeleton, and to antibacterial compositions containing
the same as an active ingredient.Heretofore, as various antibacterial substances,
there have been proposed many carbapenem antibiotic
substances having, as a basic skeleton, carba-2-penem-3-carboxylic
acid represented by the following
formula (A):
For example, an initial generation of carbapenem
antibiotics is a naturally occurring carbapenem
compound such as thienamycin represented by the formula
(B):
The thienamycin may be obtained from a fermentation
broth of Streptomyces cattleya and has a broad 
range of antibacterial spectra against Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria. It has been expected therefore to
be developed as a highly useful compound, but its poor
chemical stability has precluded its commercialization.EP-A-161 541 discloses antibiotic 6-[1-hydroxyethyl]-2-SR8-1-methyl-1-carbadethiapen-2-em-3-carboxylic
acids and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and
esters (I):

wherein:
R8 is

and
wherein n and m are independently selected from 0, 1, 2,
3, 4; X is -NR; and Y is -R, or -NRR; and wherein R is
independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl,
alkynyl (having 1-6 carbon atoms); cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl
(having 3-6 carbon atoms); and heterocyclyl,
heteroaryl (having 3-6 ring atoms, one or more of which is
N, O or S). With the foregoing background, many researchers
have attempted to develop a carbapenem compound having
antibacterial activities as high as thienamycin and
ensuring more chemical stability. As a result, there has
been developed imipenem (INN) represented by the following
formula (C):

This compound is a practically available antibacterial
agent and may be obtained by converting an amino group as
a side chain at the 2-position to a formimidoyl group.The imipenem of the formula (C) exhibits antibacterial
activities higher than those of the thienamycin
and ensures some degree of chemical stability; however,
it presents the disadvantage that it is decomposed within
a short period of time by kidney dehydropeptidase (DHP)
in the living body. For this reason, it cannot be administered
singly, and must be used in combination with a
DHP inhibitor in order to control its decomposition
leading to inactivation. Its formulation for clinical
administration is a
