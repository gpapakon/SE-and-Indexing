<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cable housing having a cover and seal, which consists essentially of a box-shaped housing made of hard plastic, a cover which can be fitted onto said housing and can be fastened thereon, and a seal which is arranged between the cover and the opening edge of the housing, the housing being designed with a large number of threaded openings in its sidewalls to accommodate cable screw unions which are in each case terminated towards the housing interior by a knock-out disc which is connected via an annular weak point. At least one of the threaded openings (12) is terminated, at least in the region of the knock-out disc (14), by a membrane (16) made of soft plastic material or rubber material, and the knock-out disc (14) is designed as a perforated disc, preferably a disc with a circular hole.

A cable housing (10) with cap and sealing, 
consisting essentially of a cuboid-shaped housing 

of hard plastic, a cap mountable on and attachable 
to the latter, and a sealing arranged between cap 

and aperture rim of the housing, the housing being 
designed in its side walls with a plurality of 

threaded openings (12) for accomodation of cable 
screwings (13), each being terminated towards the 

inside of the housing by a break-off disk (14) 
connected over a ring-shaped breaking point (15), 

characterized in that at least one of the threaded 
openings (12) is terminated by a diaphragm (16) of 

soft plastic or caoutchouc at least in the area of 
the break-off disk (14), and that the break-off 

disk (14) is designed as a perforated disk, 
preferably a circularly perforated disk.
