<ABSTRACT>
A shorter fitting time per grommet can be achieved using this device, which is of simple and cost-effective construction. A rotating device (11) is provided for this purpose, which device can be rotated onwards step by step and has a plurality of pegs (31), one grommet (17) in each case being pushed on to one peg (31) in a first position (I). When the rotating device (11) is in a second position (II), the grommet (17) is pushed on to a thicker part of the peg (31), by means of a pushing-on unit (33), in order to expand said grommet (17). A fitting head has a grommet retaining part (41) and a spreading part (42), by means of which the grommet (17) is pulled off the peg (31) in a further position (IV) of the rotating device (11), the grommet (17) being held in the expanded state by the spreading part (42), and being pushed on to the cable (13).

Equipment for fitting grommets onto electrical cables and with a 
drum (2), which is open at at least one end face, is fillable by 

grommets and is drivable about an axis (3), which is inclined to the 
horizontal, with scoops (6) arranged in the interior of the drum (2) and 

with a conveying rail (7), which projects into the drum and to which the 
grommets are transferred for the positionally correct storage and 

further conveying when the drum (2) is rotating, wherein an ejector 
device (10) is provided with a centring mandrel (30), which is movable 

up and down and by means of which the respectively first grommet in the 
conveying rail (7) is fed to a rotary device (11), characterised 

thereby, 

that the rotary device (11) displays several mandrels (31) and is 
rotatable further step by step through a certain angle, wherein a 

respective grommet (17) is pushed onto the tip of a mandrel (31) in a 
first setting (I) of the rotary device (11) 
that a loading unit (33) is provided, by means of which the grommet 
(17) is for the purpose of opening-out pushed onto a part of the 

mandrel (31), the diameter of which is greater than that in the 
region of the tip, in a second setting (II) of the rotary device (11) 

and 
that an equipping head (40) is provided, which displays a grommet-receiving 
part (41) and a splaying part (42), by means of which the 

grommet (17) is drawn off from the mandrel (31) in a further setting 
(IV) of the rotary device (11), wherein the grommet (17) is kept in 

the widened-out state by the splaying part (42) and pushed onto the 
cable (13). 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
rotary device (11) displays four mandrels (31), which are arranged one 

displaced relative to the other through an angle of 90° and that the 
rotary device (11) is rotatable further step by step through an angle of 

90°.  
 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
loading unit (33) displays two shaped plates (34), in each of which a 

respective half of a bore (35) is arranged, which in the second setting 
(II) of the rotary device (11) is in alignment with a respective mandrel 

(31), wherein the shaped plates (34) are fastened at holders (36), which 
are resiliently connected by way of bolts (37) and springs (38) with a 

carrier (39), which is displaceable in the direction of the mandrel 
(31). 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, 

that the grommet-receiving part (41) consists of two jaws (43), which 
each display a respective half of a cylindrical recess (44), 
that the cylindrical recess (44) is matched to the shape of the 
grommets (17) to be processed and 
that the jaws (43) are arranged to be radially displaceable in 
opposite sense on a guide carrier (45). 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, 

that the splaying part (42) consists of two further jaws (46), which 
each display a respective half of a sleeve-shaped attachment (47) and 

of a bore (48) extending therethrough, 
that the diameter of the bore (48) is so dimensioned that the cable 
(13) to be equipped can be introduced, 
that the bore (48) displays a funnel-shaped enlargement (49) at that 
side of the further jaws (46) which is remote from the sleeve-shaped 

attachment (47) and 
 
that the further jaws (46) are arranged to be radially displaceable 

in opposite sense on a further guide carrier (50). 
Equipment according to the claims 4 and 5, characterised thereby, 
that the jaws (43) and the further jaws (46) are coupled together and 

displaceable simultaneously.  
 
Equipment according to the claims 4 and 5, characterised thereby, 

that the grommet-receiving part (41) and the splaying part (42) are 
displaceable each relative to the other in the axial direction of the 

cylindrical recess (44) and of the bore (48), 
that the grommet-receiving part (41) is connected with a housing 
(51), which is displaceable in the axial direction of the cylindrical 

recess (44) and of the bore (48), 
wherein the grommet-receiving part (41) and the splaying part (42) 
are arranged in such a manner that the cylindrical recess (44) and 

the bore (48) are in alignment with one of the mandrels (31) in the 
further setting (IV) of the rotary device (11). 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the drum 
(2) rests loosely on rollers (4) and is drivable by way of at least one 

of the rollers (4) and that the drum (2) displays a projecting rim (5), 

which bears on a supporting roller which is rotatable about an axis 
extending perpendicularly or parallelly to the axis (3).
