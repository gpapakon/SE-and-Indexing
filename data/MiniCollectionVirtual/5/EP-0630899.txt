<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel cephem
compound, a process for producing the compound and a
pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.With the spreading use of third-generation
cephalosporins in recent years, infectious diseases
associated with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) are presenting serious problems. These
cephalosporins of the third generation have potent
activity against gram-negative bacilli but because of
their relatively low activity against gram-positive
cocci, the strains of S. aureaus which are resistant to
β-lactam antibiotics have increased in number and the
resultant refractory infections constitute a serious
threat today. The only therapeutic drug available for
MRSA infections today is vancomycin which is a polypeptide
antibiotic but since it has side effects such as
eczema and renal toxicity, vancomycin calls for caution
in administration.As 3-thiovinylcephalosporin derivatives having 
antimicrobial activity, the compounds described in
Japanese Examined Patent Application 17592/1987 and
Japanese Patent Unexamined Application 130292/1984 (EP-A111281)
gazettes are known to this day. The latter
gazette describes compounds having an alkoxyimino group
in the side chain in the 7-position and a thiovinyl
quaternary ammonium salt in the 3-position of the
cephalosporin nucleus but does not refer to a
hydroxyimino group. Furthermore, there is no disclosure
in these prior art publications that a 3-thiovinylcephalosporin
derivative is active against MRSA.US-A-4-307-116 discloses structurally similar compounds.
However, the anti-microbial activity against meticillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, is not always satisfying.
EP-A-0 268 307 and EP-A-0 195 947 have structures comprising
a cephem ring which are quite different from the compounds
of the present invention. Their anti-microbial
activity against MRSA was not known and proved to be
insufficient in many cases. EP-A-0 192 210 discloses
structurally similar compounds. Their anti-microbial activity
against MRSA was not known and proved to be insufficient in
many cases.It is an object of this invention to provide
cephem compounds having excellent antimicrobial activity
and, in particular, novel cephem compounds which are
active against MRSA and safe to use. It is another object of the invention to
provide a process for producing the above-mentioned
compounds.A further object of this invention is to
provide a pharmaceutical composition for the therapy of
MRSA-induced infectious diseases.For the purpose of
