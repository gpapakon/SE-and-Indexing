<ABSTRACT>
Monolithic arrays having closely spaced laser stripes which output laser beams with 
large, but well-controlled, wavelength separations. The monolithic array uses a plurality of 

stacked active regions (28,30,32; 38,40,42) which are stacked in the order of decreasing energy 
bandgaps as one moves away from the substrate (9). Those active regions are separated by 

one or more thin etch stop layers (34,44). Between the bottom active regions (28,30,32) and 
the substrate (9) is a lower cladding layer (12), while over the topmost active region of each 

stack is an upper cladding layer (46). Beneficially, an electrical connection is made to each 
stack using a heavily d
oped capping layer (48)/metallic contact (50) above each stack and a 
metallic contact (56) on the substrate (which is shared by all stacks). Lateral carrier and optical 

confinement is achieved using a confinement layer (54) which surrounds each stack. 
Beneficially, that confinement layer is formed using layer induced disordering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light emitting structure and in particular to solid-state laser arrays which output multiple laser beams
having different colors (wavelengths).The performance of many devices, such as laser printers and optical memories, can be
improved by the incorporation of multiple laser beams. For example, laser printers which use
multiple beams can have higher printing speeds and/or better spot acuity than printers which
use only a single beam.In many applications, closely spaced laser beams of different colors (wavelengths) are
desirable. For example, color printers which use closely spaced laser beams of different colors
can overlap the beams, sweep those overlapping beams using a single raster output polygon
scanner and a single set of optics, subsequently separate the individual beams using color
selective filters, direct each beam onto a separate xerographic imaging station, develop a
latent image for each color on a different recording medium, and produce a full color image by
sequentially developing each latent image on a single recording medium.One way to obtain closely spaced laser beams is to form multiple laser emission sites,
or laser stripes, on a common substrate. While this enables very closely spaced beams, prior art
monolithic laser arrays typically output laser beams at only one color.However, various techniques are known in the prior art for producing different color
laser beams from a monolithic laser array. For example, it is well known that a small amount of
color difference can be obtained by varying the drive conditions at each lasing region.
However, the easily achievable color difference is insufficient for most applications.One method of achieving large wavelength separations is to grow a first set of active
layers on a substrate to form a first lasing element which outputs light at one wavelength, and
then to form a second set of active layers next to the first to form a second lasing element at a
second wavelength. However, this method requires separate crystal growths for each lasing
element, something which is not easily performed.Another technique for obtaining different color laser beams from a monolithic laser
array is to use stacked active regions. A stacked active region monolithic array is one in which a
plurality of active regions are sandwiched between common cladding layers. Each active
region is comprised of a thin volume that is contained within a laser stripe. The laser stripes
contain different numbers of active regions that emit laser beams
