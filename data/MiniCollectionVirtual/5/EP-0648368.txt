<ABSTRACT>
A recording head (9) and a playback head (8) each provided with separate actuating devices. A storage hopper (33) between the heads (8,9) receives the tape (2) fed out by the recording head (9) and stores it in loose, random folds when the tape region facing the recording head (9) is at a distance from the tape region facing the reading head (8). Two reels interacting with respective heads are arranged in a cassette (1). When the cassette is inserted, a roller (3) grips the tape and pre-engages it into the storage hopper (33). This apparatus enables time-delay playback without causing undesirable congestion or tape installation problems.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus with which the recording and simultaneous or 
time-delayed playback of a recording tape such as a videotape 

recorder or tape recorder tape can be carried out, the 
apparatus comprising a recording head (9), means for having 

the tape (2) circulate in front of the recording head towards 
and from a recording reel (6) respectively, a reading head 

(8), means for having the tape circulate in front of the 
reading head towards and from the playback reel (7) 

respectively both the heads being provided with means 
enabling them to be actuated independently of each other and 

in addition a storage hopper (33), located operatively 
between the two heads (8 and 9) for receiving and 

storing a portion of the tape when the tape region facing the 
reading head (8) is at a distance from the tape region facing 

the recording head (9), and said apparatus including fitting 
means (28) for a cassette (1) with two reels (6 and 7) each 

of which is associated with one of the ends of the tape, the 
recording and reading heads being arranged so that each one 

cooperates with one of the reels of the cassette one of which 
in operation constitutes the recording reel and the other the 

playback reel respectively, characterised in that the 
apparatus moreover includes means (3, 24 and 25) for bringing 

the tape into position in relation to the storage hopper (33) 
after the insertion of the cassette, said storage hopper 

storing the tape in loose and random folds, and in that the 
apparatus comprises means (8, 22, 4) for moving the tape in 

reverse with respect to the recording direction, from the 
playback reel (7) towards the storing hopper (33).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised by 
further comprising rolls (18, 22) allowing to displace the 

tape from the playback reel (7) towards the storage hopper 
(33) at different speeds in reverse, with or without the tape 

being read. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the storage hopper (33) is in a vertical position and 

has a upper entry disposed between the said reading head (8) 

and the said recording head (9). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the storage hopper (33) has, in the 

direction of the width of the tape (2), a dimension equal to 
the width of the tape. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by means (3 ; 24, 25) for detecting the 

exhaustion of the length of tape contained in the hopper 
(33). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the said means for bringing the tape 

into position include means (24, 25) for drawing a portion of 
the tape (2) into a loop towards the inside of the hopper 

in such a way that the said portion of the tape enters and 
leaves the storage hopper through the entry thereof. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the means for drawing a portion of the tape include an idle 

roll (25) which can be displaced vertically on a carriage 
(24) so as to draw the tape (2) into the operating position 

towards the inside of the hopper from the initial position 
when the cassette is inserted. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that 
from a situation in which a reserve of the said tape (2) is 

stored in the hopper (33), the idle roll (25) is used to  
 

indicate that the said reserve has been used up when it is 
stressed by the tape towards the outside of the hopper. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that it includes revolution counters on the 

guide and drive mechanisms so as to know the size of the 
offset between recording and playback. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the hopper is associated with means for 

carrying out a blowing or suction action on the random folds 
formed by the tape. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the storage hopper (33) has, for the 

tape, a relatively narrow entry/outlet opening located 
between the two heads (8, 9) and associated with means (3, 

24, 25) for pre-engaging a loop of tape towards the inside of 
the storage hopper (33).
