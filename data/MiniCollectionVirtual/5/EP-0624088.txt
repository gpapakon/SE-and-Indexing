<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to compositions and methods for inhibiting protein aging. Accordingly, a composition is disclosed which comprises an agent or compound capable of inhibiting the formation of advanced glycosylation end products of target proteins by reacting with the carbonyl moiety of the early glycosylation product of such target proteins formed by their initial glycosylation. Suitable agents are amino acids and their derivatives which contain an active nitrogen-containing group. Particular agents comprise lysine and mixtures thereof. The method comprises contacting the target protein with the composition. Both industrial and therapeutic applications for the invention are envisioned, as food spoilage and animal protein aging can be treated.

All of the above publications are incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to the aging of proteins resulting from reaction of glucose, and particularly to the nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins and subsequent reactions leading to advanced glycosylation end products, and to methods and agents for their inhibition.The reaction between glucose and proteins has been known for some time. Its earliest manifestation was in the appearance of brown pigments during the cooking of food, which was identified by Maillard in 1912, who observed that glucose or other reducing sugars react with a ino acids to form adducts that undergo a series of dehydrations and rearrangements to form stable brown 

pigments, Maillard, L.D. C.R. Acad. Sci.. 154. pp. 66-68 (1912) .In the years that followed the initial discovery by Maillard, food chemists studied the hypothesized reaction in detail and determined that stored and heat treated foods undergo nonenzymatic browning as a result of the reaction between glucose and the polypeptide chain, and that the proteins are resultingly crosslinked and correspondingly exhibit decreased bioavailability. At this point, it was determined that the pigments responsible for the development of the brown color that develops as a result of protein glycosylation possessed characteristic spectra and fluorescent properties; however, the chemical structure of the pigments had not been specifically elucidated.The reaction between reducing sugars and food proteins discussed above was found in recent years to have its parallel in vivo. Thus, the nonenzymatic reaction between
