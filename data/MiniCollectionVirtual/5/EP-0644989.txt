<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for predetermining the actual transmission ratio of a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for a motor vehicle, in particular a private car. Operation points in a shifting characteristic field which lie on a characteristic curve of optimised consumption (c') in a characteristic field of the engine of the motor vehicle may be adopted, and operation points in a shifting characteristic field which lie on a characteristic curve of optimised output (c") in the characteristic field of the engine may also be adopted. The characteristic curve of the shifting characteristic field results from the selected characteristic curve of the characteristic field of the engine. Operation points in the shifting characteristic field which lie on a dynamic characteristic curve (c'") which runs between the characteristic curve (c') of optimised consumption and the characteristic curve (c") of the optimised output may be adopted. Theposition of the dynamic characteristic curve (c'") varies according to the speed with which the output requirements are changed.

<CLAIMS>
Method for specifying the actual transmission 
ratio of a continuously variable transmission (CVT) of a 

vehicle, especially a passenger car, in which it is 
possible for operating points of a change characteristic 

map which are located on an optimized-consumption characteristic 
of an engine characteristic map of an engine of 

the vehicle to be assumed and in which it is also possible 
for operating points of the change characteristic 

map which are located on an optimized-power characteristic 
of the engine characteristic map to be assumed, the 

shape of the characteristics of the change characteristic 
map resulting from the respectively selected characteristic 

of the engine characteristic map, characterized in 
that it is possible for operating points of the change 

characteristic map to be assumed which are located on a 
dynamic characteristic (c''') of the engine characteristic 

map which runs between the optimized-consumption 
characteristic (c') and the optimized-power characteristic 

(c"), the position of the dynamic characteristic 
(c''') depending on the magnitude of the rate of change 

of the power demand. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the power demand corresponds to the position of the 

throttle valve of the engine and hence the rate of change 
of the power demand corresponds to the rate of change of 

the throttle valve. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a boundary line of the change 

characteristic map corresponds to a characteristic 
associated with an optimized consumption.  

 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a further boundary line of the 

change map corresponds to a characteristic associated 
with an optimized power.
