Final drying group with a device for selective treatment of moving 
webs, preferably of paper or cardboard, by spreading, pigmenting 

or gluing or omitting treatment of the moving web, and that in an 
intermediate space between two adjacent drying cylinders (46, 49) 

of the final drying group, which corresponds with a maximum of 
two diameters of the drying cylinders, is provided at least one 

diverting roller (16) for bridging the intermediate space in the 
event that the web is not treated by a spreading device (3, 3') 

arranged for spreading, pigmenting or gluing in this area of the 
web path, and at least one further diverting roller (18) is provided 

in this area by means of which the web is delivered to the 
spreading device (3, 3') from below, and the spreading device (3, 

3') is essentially positioned above the intermediate space between 
the adjacent drying cylinders (46, 49). 
Final drying group according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
spreading device is composed of two web-guiding rollers (1, 2) 

which are arranged in such a manner that the plane placed 
through their rotary axis deviates from the horizontal by no more 

than 20Â°, and a maximum one application mechanism (3, 3') of the 
casing surfaces is associated with each web-guiding roller (1, 2), 

so that the coating substance is initially transferred to the casing 

surfaces of the web-guiding rollers (1, 2) and from there to the 
web via a press gap which is established between both web-guiding 

rollers (1, 2). 
Final drying group according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the spreading device (1, 2, 3, 3') is arranged at a higher level 
of a machine floor or foundation than the drying cylinder group. 
Final drying group according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the drying cylinder group is arranged in 
double rows, and the two drying cylinders arranged on the 

intermediate space which is bridged by the at least one diverting 
roller (16) are an upper and a lower drying cylinder respectively.  

 
Final drying group according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 in 
the moving direction of the web on the intermediate space which 

is bridged by the at least one diverting roller (16) is initially 
arranged an upper drying cylinder (46) which is followed by a 

lower drying cylinder (49), and in the intermediate space are 
arranged two diverting rollers (16, 17) for transferring the web 

directly between the two drying cylinders. 
Final drying group according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
, as seen in the moving direction of the web, 
in front of the intermediate space which accommodates the at 

least one diverting roller (16) between the adjacent drying 
cylinders are additionally one lower drying cylinder and a following 

upper drying cylinder (46), and in the intermediate space are 
arranged two diverting rollers (16, 17) for transferring the web 

between the adjacent drying cylinders.
