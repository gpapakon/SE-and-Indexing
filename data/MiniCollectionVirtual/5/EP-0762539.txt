<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chip antennas. In particular, 
the present invention relates to a chip antenna used 
for mobile communication and local area networks (LAN). A prior art chip antenna is disclosed, for example, as "a 
microstrip antenna" at page 1,353 of "Denshi Joho Tsushin 
Handbook", Volume 1 edited by Denshi Joho Tsushin Gakkai 
(The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication 
Engineers) (Published on March 30, 1988, Publisher: Ohm 
K.K.). Fig. 10 is an isometric view illustrating a prior art microstrip 
antenna described in the document set forth above. 
The microstrip antenna 1 has a dielectric substrate 2 which 
is provided with a meandering strip conductor 3 having a 
plurality of corners on the front surface, and a grounding 
electrode 4 on the back surface. The strip conductor 3, as 
well as the dielectric substrate 2 and the grounding electrode 
4, comprises a microstrip line. However, in the prior microstrip antenna 1 set forth above, 
polarization of radio waves is singular, and a plurality of 
radio waves having various planes cannot be radiated, in 
other words, the antenna exhibits only the upward directivity 
of the dielectric substrate 2. It is an object of the present invention to provide a chip 
antenna which exhibits directivity to a plurality of planes  
 
of polarization and a wide frequency bandwidth. In accordance with the present invention, a chip antenna 
comprises a substrate comprising either of a dielectric 
material or a magnetic material, at least one conductor 
meanderingly formed on the surface of the substrate and/or 
inside the substrate and having at least one corner, and at 
least one feeding terminal provided on the surface of the 
substrate for applying a voltage to the conductor. Further, the chip antenna comprises at least one fixing 
terminal to fix the substrate to a surface of a mounting 
board. Because the chip antenna in accordance with the present 
invention comprises a substrate formed of either of a 
dielectric material or a magnetic material, the propagation 
speed is lowered and the wavelength is shortened. Thus, the 
effective line length becomes ε1/2 times the dielectric constant 
ε of the dielectric material or the magnetic material. Further, when the fixing terminal is provided, the chip 
antenna can be stably fixed to a surface mounting board. Other features and advantages of the present invention will 
become apparent from the following description of the invention 
which refers to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is
