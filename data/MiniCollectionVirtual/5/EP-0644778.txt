<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiodiagnostic reagents and peptides, and 
methods for producing labeled radiodiagnostic agents. Specifically, the 
invention relates to scintigraphic imaging agents for imaging sites in a 
mammalian body comprising specific-binding peptides labeled with technetium-99m 
(Tc-99m) via a radiolabel-binding moiety which forms a complex with Tc-99m. 
In particular, the peptide reagents of the invention are covalently linked 
to a polyvalent linker moiety, so that the polyvalent linker moiety is covalently 
linked to a multiplicity of the specific-binding peptides, and the Tc-99m 
binding 
moieties are covalently linked to a plurality of the specific-binding peptides, the 
polyvalent linker moiety, or to both the specific-binding peptides and the 
polyvalent linker moiety. Methods and kits for making such reagents, and 
methods for using such reagents are also provided. In the field of nuclear medicine, certain pathological conditions are 
localized, or their extent is assessed, by detecting the distribution of small 
quantities of internally-administered radioactively labeled tracer compounds 
(called radiotracers or radiopharmaceuticals). Methods for detecting these 
radiopharmaceuticals are known generally as imaging or radioimaging methods. In radioimaging, the radiolabel is a gamma-radiation emitting 
radionuclide and the radiotracer is located using a gamma-radiation detecting 
camera (this process is often referred to as gamma scintigraphy). The imaged 
site is detectable because the radiotracer is chosen either to localize at a 
pathological site (termed positive contrast) or, alternatively, the radiotracer is 
chosen specifically not to localize at such pathological sites (termed negative 
contrast). A variety of radionuclides are known to be useful for radioimaging, 
including 67Ga, 99mTc (Tc-99m), 111In, 123I, 125I, 169Yb or 186Re. A number of  
 
factors must be considered for optimal radioimaging in humans. To maximize 
the efficiency of detection, a radionuclide that emits gamma energy in the 100 
to 200 keV range is preferred. To minimize the absorbed radiation dose to the 
patient, the physical half-life of the radionuclide should be as short as the 
imaging procedure will allow. To allow for examinations to be performed on 
any day and at any time of the day, it is advantageous to have a source of the 
radionuclide always available at the clinical site. Tc-99m is a preferred 
radionuclide because it emits gamma radiation at 140 keV, it has a physical 
half-life of 6
