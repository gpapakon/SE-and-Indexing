<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an operating method for a computer (1) having a processor (2) and a memory (3),   - an operating system and an administration program connected upstream of the operating system being stored in the memory (3), - at least one set of configuration data respectively for the operating system and for the administration program being stored in the memory (3), by means of which data set it can be determined which authorisations are allocated to the operating system and to the administration program, respectively, - the sets of configuration data being able to be changed only by means of the administration program.

Operating method for a computer (1) having a processor
(2) and a memory (3),


an operating system and a management program inserted
upstream of the operating system being stored in the

memory (3),
in which there is stored in the memory (3) for the
operating system and the management program at least

one configuration dataset in each case which
stipulates which powers are assigned to the operating

system or to the management program, respectively,
in which the configuration datasets can only be
changed by means of the management program.
Operating method according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the processor (2) can be operated with normal

commands in a normal operating mode and additionally also
with privileged commands in a privileged operating mode, in

that the operating system is processed in the normal
operating mode and in that the management program is

processed in the privileged operating mode.
Operating method according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the operating system appears to the user to be

partially processed in the privileged operating mode.
Operating method according to Claim 3, characterized
in that a separate configuration dataset is used in each

case to stipulate the powers of the operating system for
apparent processing in the privileged operating mode and

for processing in the normal operating mode.
Operating method according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that the processing of privileged commands

by the operating system generates an interrupt, in that, on
the basis of the configuration dataset assigned to the 

operating system, the management program checks whether the
operating system is allowed to execute said command, in

that the management program executes the privileged command
depending on the result of the check and in that the

management program then invokes the operating system again.
Operating method according to one of the above claims,
characterized in that the processor (2) can be interrupted

by interrupts and in that all the interrupts initiate an
invocation of the management program.
Operating method according to Claim 6, characterized
in that the interrupts can be disabled or cleared only by

the management program.
Operating method according to one of the above claims,
characterized in that the operating system can be

reinitialized at any time without affecting the management

program.
Operating method according to one of the above claims,
characterized in that the management program is processed

as part of a real-time operating system for loading control
tasks.
Operating method according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the real-time operating system processes its

control tasks unaffected by the operating system.
Computer having a processor (2) and a memory (3), in
which an operating system and a management program inserted

upstream of the operating system can be stored in the
memory (3), in which at least one configuration dataset can

be stored in each case in the memory (3) for the operating
system and the management program, in which the

configuration datasets can stipulate which powers are
assigned to the operating system and the management 

program, and in which the configuration datasets can be
changed only by the management program.
Computer according to Claim 11, characterized in that
the processor (2) has a normal operating mode and a

privileged operating mode and in that the normal operating
mode is assigned to the operating system and the privileged

operating mode to the management program.
Computer according to Claim 12, characterized in that
an additional configuration dataset can be stored in the

memory (3) for an apparent assignment of the privileged
operating mode to the operating system.
Computer according to Claim 12 or 13, characterized in
that the processor (2) can be interrupted by interrupts and

in that interrupts can be fed to the operating system
solely by means of the management program.
Computer according to Claim 14, characterized in that
the interrupts can be disabled or cleared only by the

management program.
Computer according to one of Claims 11 to 15,
characterized in that the operating system is designed as

standard operating system and in that the management
program is part of a real-time operating system for loading

control tasks.
Computer according to Claim 16, characterized in that
the real-time operating system is unaffected by the

operating system.
