<ABSTRACT>
Electrical lighting device (illumination device) for a bicycle, in which a front lamp and the dynamo are mounted on a common holder, the lamp and the dynamo being designed, with respect to the holder, such that they are separately height-adjustable and/or pivotable about a horizontal axis and lockable. The holder comprises: a first (sub)-holding device (1, 1') which has at least the first, latchable coupling means (12.1, 12.1', 12.2 and 12.2') and jointly supporting the front lamp (3, 3') and the dynamo (2, 2'), and a second (sub)holding device (4, 4', 4'') which is provided on the front fork (5) of the bicycle and has a second, latchable coupling means (12.3, 12.3', 12.4 and 12.4') which forms a mating piece for the first, latchable coupling means. Furthermore, the first and second latchable coupling means (12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.1', 12.2', 12.3', 12.4', respectively) can be detached from each other by means of an operating element which requires for its release a pressure actuation or a rotary or swivelling movement of less than one revolution, and said coupling means retain their locked presetting with respect to the first (sub)holding device when the front lamp (3, 3') and the dynamo (2, 2') are being fitted or removed.
