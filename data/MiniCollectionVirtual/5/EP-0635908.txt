<ABSTRACT>
A connector including a locking mechanism to 
prevent a charge coupling from being broken when 

charging. A supply connector (1) connected to a power 
source and a vehicle battery connector (2) installed in 

an electric vehicle has a handle grip (11) and a 
connector body (12) attached to 
a distal end of the 
handle grip (11). The handle grip (11) is provided in 

its interior with a lock mechanism (21) which maintains 
and releases the coupling of the supply connector (1) 

to the vehicle inlet and with a control (35) which 
control the lock mechanism. The control includes a 

detector (17) for detecting a complete coupling of the 
supply connector to the vehicle connector. The control 

actuates the lock mechanism only when the detector 
detects the complete coupling and commencement of 

charging and releases the lock mechanism only when 
charging is stopped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to charge couplings for
electric vehicles and more particularly to couplings for
detachably coupling supply connectors to battery connectors
installed in electric vehicles for charging thereof.Since charging of a battery is essential to an
electric vehicle, a power source for charging should be
readily connectable to a battery installed in the vehicle.
Heretofore, a battery connector is provided in the electric
vehicle while a supply connector is connected to the power
source. The supply connector is detachably connected to
the battery connector to charge the battery.As charging an electric vehicle requires a
relatively long time in comparison with supplying gasoline,
an operator can not always stand ready for charging.
Particularly, in the case that the charging is carried
out at home, it is difficult to effect rapid charging at
a high current. Consequently, charging may be carried out
when a vehicle is parked at an owner's home overnight. In
this case, the supply connector is fitted to the battery
connector to commence charging and is maintained in the
fitting position for a long time at a lower current.US-A-4 553 000 discloses a supply connector comprising
electrical bridges driven forward by actuator means.
After insertion of the plug into the receptacle, the plug
terminals and receptacle terminals are electrically
bridged by the electrical bridges driven forward by actuator
means.However, such conventional supply connectors have
not been provided with satisfactory locking mechanisms. For
example, conventional supply connectors are easily detached
from the battery connector during charging. Consequently,
a person not aware of the state of charge of a vehicle may
detach the supply connector when charging is incomplete.
Even if a lock mechanism is provided on a supply connector,
charging may be started with the lock not fully engaged,
whereby the supply connector may be accidentally
disconnected from the vehicle battery connector. An object of the present invention is to provide
a charging coupling for an electric vehicle, which can
prevent a supply connector from being carelessly detached
from a vehicle battery connector and prevent commencement
of charging with the coupling not fully engaged.In achieving the above object, a supply connector for
detachably coupling to a vehicle battery
connector to charge an electric vehicle in accordance with
the present invention comprises a supply connector body; a lock mechanism for
maintaining and releasing a coupling of the supply
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A supply connector (1) for for detachably coupling to a
vehicle battery connector to charge an electric vehicle,

comprising:

a supply connector body (12);
a lock mechanism for maintaining and releasing
a coupling of said supply connector body to said vehicle

inlet; and
means for controlling said lock mechanism (21) to actuate
it only when charging of the electric vehicle is commenced

and to release it only when charging of the electric vehicle
is complete.
A supply connector according to Claim 1, wherein
said controlling means are provided with means for detecting

a complete coupling of said supply connector body to said
vehicle battery connector, and wherein said controlling

means actuates said lock mechanism only when said detecting
means detect said complete coupling and commencement of

charging of the electric vehicle and releases said lock
mechanism only when charging of the electric vehicle is

stopped.
A coupling according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein said
lock mechanism includes means for detecting an operating

state of said lock mechanism and means for indicating an
operating state of said lock mechanism.
