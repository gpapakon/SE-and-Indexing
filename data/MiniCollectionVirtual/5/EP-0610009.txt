<ABSTRACT>
A photoreceptor apparatus comprising a photoreceptor belt (3) releasably attached 
to the surface (2) of a cylindrical mandrel (1). The photoreceptor belt is attached to the 

mandrel by means of a slot (5) in the mandrel capable of accepting a portion of the belt and 
retained therein by means of a releasable key (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photoreceptors for electrophotographic printing. In an electrophotographic mono-color printing machine, a photoconductive member 
is charged to a substantially uniform potential. The charged portion of the photoconductive 
member is exposed to a light reflected original document image. Exposure of the charged 
photoconductive member selectively dissipates the charge in the irradiated areas. This records 
an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive member corresponding to the 
informational areas contained within the original document being reproduced. After the 
electrostatic latent image is recorded on the photoconductive member, the latent image is 
developed by bringing it into contact with toner. The toner image on the photoconductive 
member is subsequently transferred to a copy sheet. The copy sheet is heated to permanently 
affix the toner image. Multicolor electrophotographic printing is substantially identical, 
although more complex than the mono-color printing process. Cyclic and tandem color 
copying processes dominate the art of color printing. In a cyclic multicolor printing process, successive latent images corresponding to 
different colors are recorded on the photoconductive member during each cycle. Accordingly, 
one photoconductive member is required in this type of machine. The photoconductive 
member is used repetitively for each color/cycle. Each single color electrostatic latent image is 
developed with toner of a color complementary thereto. This process is repeated a plurality of 
cycles for the different colors in an image and the respective complementary color toner. Each 
single color toner image is transferred to the copy sheet and superimposed with the prior toner 
image. This creates a multilayered toner image on the copy sheet. Thereafter, the multilayered 
toner image is permanently affixed to the copy sheet creating a color copy. The primary 
attributes of a cyclic printing machine are its relatively low number of parts and its low cost. 
US-A-4,583,991 describes a cyclic printing machine in which a sheet moves in a recirculating 
path and successive color toners images are transferred thereto. A typical tandem printing machine uses multiple printing engines to transfer, in one 
cycle, different colored toner images directly to a sheet or to an intermediate for subsequent 
transfer to the sheet. Printing rate is the primary advantage of a tandem machine since all 
colors are printed in one cycle. However, the complex equipment of a
