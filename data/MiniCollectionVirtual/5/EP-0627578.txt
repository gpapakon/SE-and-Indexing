<ABSTRACT>
A brake (B-3) in a transmission has a discharge 
line (Ld) connected to a drain line via a 3-4 shift 

valve (22). An electronic control unit has means for 
determining tie-up of brakes (B-3,B-2) on the basis of 

detection signals from various sensors arranged for 
shifting in a gear shift mechanism. Responsive to an 

output from the tie-up detecting means, a 4th speed 
signal is outputted to the 3-4 shift valve (22) to 

temporarily change only a hydraulic circuit into a 4th 
speed state, so that the release-side brake (B-3) is 

promptly released by draining hydraulic pressure 
through the 3-4 shift valve (22) without flowing 

through a 2-3 timing valve (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic transmission, 
and especially to a hydraulic control system for 
engaging or releasing frictional engagement elements in 
a gear shift mechanism to shift the automatic transmission. In an automatic transmission, it has heretofore 
been needed, in some instances, to simultaneously perform 
engagement and/or release of two frictional 
engagement elements, in other words, so-called gear 
change operations upon shifting between particular 
speed stages. In such instances, the torque of an output 
shaft suddenly drops due to tie-up or engine racing 
occurs due to an underlap, unless the timing of the operations 
is appropriately controlled. With a view 
toward avoiding such problems, it has heretofore been 
the common practice to arrange one-way clutches in 
parallel with the respective frictional engagement elements 
so that while using the one-way clutches for 
releasing the corresponding frictional engagement elements, 
the timing of the gear change operations is  
 
automatically maintained well by controlling hydraulic 
pressure only on engaged sides. On the other hand, a construction may be adopted 
without the above one-way clutches so that the gear 
shift mechanism can be constructed compact. As one example 
of such constructions, there is the technique 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
(Kokai) No. HEI 1-224553, in which shifting between the 
2nd speed and the 3rd speed (hereinafter abbreviated as 
"2-3 shift". This applies equally to other shifts) and 
3-4 shift are performed without one-way clutches. In 
this transmission, to precisely perform, upon 2-3 
shift, gear change operations of the corresponding 
frictional engagement elements (the clutches in this 
example), a timing valve is arranged in a hydraulic 
control system so that feeding of hydraulic pressure to 
both the clutches or discharge of hydraulic pressure 
from both the clutches can be conducted by a single 
directional control valve. Further, to ensure the 
above shift even if the valve should become inoperative 
due to sticking or the like, the hydraulic pressure on 
each discharge side can still be drained separately 
from an oil line, which is arranged in parallel with 
the directional control valve, via a small-diameter 
orifice.  According to the technique disclosed in the 
above patent publication, however, there is obviously a 
limitation to the amount of hydraulic pressure to be 
discharged through the small-diameter orifice so that 
the technique is hardly effective
