<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of generating a representation of a 
visual design. The visual design could be applied to advertising material, 

signage, letterheads or packaging, for example, where it is important to 
maintain a consistent identity from one application to the next. The 

method includes storing data defining a number of visual design 
elements such as logos, graphics or other images, as well as text 

elements including predetermined words and phrases. Predetermined 
design parameters for different design applications are also stored. 

These parameters, together with user-entered variables within a 
permitted range adjust the relative size of each element and the 

juxtaposition of the elements in the final design. The result is designs 
which are consistent in the impression which they create to a viewer, 

even when applied to widely differing articles. The finished visual design 
may be displayed on a screen for viewing, and will then be printed in a 

hard-copy form as final artwork.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a method of generating a visual design for
application, for example, in the field of advertising, packaging or
creating corporate images.When visual design elements such as logos, logotypes or graphics and
text elements relating to a corporate identity or product range are used
in various different applications, it can become extremely difficult to
maintain a consistent identity. For example, a particular trade mark may
be applied to a number of different products, with a number of different
forms of packaging, as well as being applied in advertising, signage, and
on letterheads. This can result in confusion and dilution of the
company's corporate identity and the product's image. In order to
counteract this, a great amount of effort may be expended by designers
in attempting to maintain a consistent image over a wide range of visual
design applications. This greatly increases the costs and time involved
in such a design process."A Practical Application of a Computer to Industrial Design", Computer Graphics
Tokyo 1984, Proceedings, 24 April 1984, pages T4-1-1-14, describes a manually operated
design program which contains basic design elements for use by a professional designer.
"Structures of an Integrated Document Workstation", Gruber, Computer & Graphics,
Vol. 11, No. 4, pages 377-387, describes a user interface for a document work station and
which allows the creation of different kinds of documents. According to the invention a computer implemented method
of generating a representation of a visual design comprises:
storing data defining a plurality of visual design elements in
a first, visuals database;displaying a menu prompting a user to select at least one of
the visual design elements and receiving a user input selecting at least
one visual design element for inclusion in the visual design;storing data defining a plurality of different predetermined
visual design applications and a plurality of predetermined design
parameters in a second, applications database, each visual design
application having one or more of the predetermined design
parameters associated with it, the predetermined design parameters
defining a scaling calculation for scaling the sizes of selected visual
design elements according to predetermined ratios and a positioning
calculation for positioning the scaled visual design elements
according to predetermined co-ordinates, both according to
predetermined design controls;displaying a menu prompting a user to select a visual design
application and

element in the visual design being determined automatically by
the predetermined design parameters associated with

selected predetermined visual design application
wherein the height and width of the visual design elements are scaled to be

predetermined proportions of the height and width of the overall design area of
the visual design, and wherein the visual design elements are positioned in

predetermined positions relative to other visual design elements; and
generating a representation of the visual design, so that
different visual designs generated by the method have a

consistent visual effect irrespective of the selected visual design
application.
A method of generating a representation of a visual design
