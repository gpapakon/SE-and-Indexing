<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing panorama images whereby a shot is made from a desired shooting position with the help of a camera with a fish eye optic whereafter the obtained image is scanned and then the digital images are transformed into a panoramic image with the help of a computer and software. The digital image is scanned by dividing the image up into narrow radial segments. Each radial segment, in the radial direction, is then divided up into a number of parts of equal height whereafter each segment part obtained is depicted on a point of a straight line, whereby the grey tint of each segment part is corrected for the modified surface on which it is depicted. The invention also concerns an apparatus which comprises a camera provided with a fish eye optic. The image area is provided with a CCD-matric on which the image obtained is projected, whereby an image in digital form is immediately obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PRODUCING PANORAMIC IMAGES, AND A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CONSULTING PANORAMIC IMAGESIt is a problem that people often have to go to a certain place in order to view the surroundings. To take one or more photographs of a certain object is often not enough, because it appears, that when these photos are consulted at another place, for instance at the office, that certain information and details can not be satisfactorily seen. Similar problems can occur with, for example, estate agents, where buyers are eager for information about certain objects offered for sale. The estate agent often has a view of the object to be sold but not of the direct surroundings. Council officials also need to view objects so that, for instance, tree felling licenses can be issued, building applications checked, or that the eventual suitability of a building initiative in an existing situation can be controlled and assessed, or that a town planner's designs, and the suitability of these designs in existing situations can be assessed.The production of panoramic images whereby the whole surroundings from one point can be observed is known. For this purpose a number of photos can be taken, with a photographic camera, which can then be put together to form a panoramic image. This method is however very time consu¬ ming and requires a large shooting storage in the case where a certain area requires more than the usual number of shots in order to be produced and recorded. It is also very diffi¬ cult to quickly and accurately find a desired image from such a file.According to a first object of the invention, a system is provided whereby a large number of panoramic images can be made in a short time, in simple manner can be recorded and then very quickly, at a desired moment, consulted. 

 Such object can be met with a method according to the invention, by which a shot of the surroundings is made from a desired shooting position with the help of a camera with a fish eye optic, and whereafter the obtained image is scanned with the aid of scanning means, after which the obtained images, in digital form, are transformed into a panoramic image with the help of a computer and software.The registering of complete surroundings in a single image, with the help of a fish eye optic is already known. However the images obtained thus, are very difficult to be interpreted in the correct manner by the human eye. Because the images obtained give a very distorted image with respects to that as seen by the human eye, it is very

 CLAIMS
1. A method for producing panoramic images, cha- racterized in that, a surroundings shot is made from a desired shooting position with the help of a camera with a fish eye optic and that following this the obtained image is scanned with scanning means and that then the obtained image, in digital form, is transformed into a panoramic image with the aid of a computer and software.
2. A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the method is provided for transforming fish eye images into panoramic images, comprising the following steps:
- centering a scanning means onto the center of an obtained fish eye image; and
- rotatingly scanning the fish eye image by a rotating scanning array of aligned light sensitive elements such that the fish eye image is divided into successive radial parts which are transformed into successive parts of a panoramic image.
3. A apparatus for the production of digital fish eye images characterized in that the apparatus comprises a camera provided with a fish eye optic and that the image area is provided with a CCD-matrix on which the obtained image is projected, whereby an image in digital form is immediately obtained.
4. A method for assembling a file of object ima¬ ges, for instance parts of cities, parts of streets, the inside of a mansion, from which the desired images can be quickly consulted, characterized in that a large number of panoramic images, taken from successive shooting positions, are recorded in a computer in digital form, whereby the shooting positions are chosen in such a way that a connecti¬ on exists between the shooting positions, for example that the shooting positions are chosen in such a way that the images, taken from successive shooting positions partly overlap each other, or that the only images concerned are 


panoramic of, for instance, objects to be sold by an estate agent.
5. Method according to claim 4, characterized in that a layout is stored together with the panoramic images in the computer, on which those points are indicated from which the panoramic shots are taken, and on which images or shots are stored together.
6. A method according to claim 4 or 5, characteri¬ zed in that, apart from the usual desired administrative information such as place, date and time, more administrati¬ ve information is added to each obtained and stored in a digital form image, such as orientation or the direction in which, for example, compass directions are observed and/or the administrative information of objects, such as house numbers, street names and so forth, which are observed from the shooting position, and that this administrative informa¬ tion gives access to the desired image.
7. A method according to claims 4, 5 or 6 charac¬ terized in that a part of the panoramic image is, for exam- pie, displayed as a quadrant.
8. A system or method for assembling a file of images in such a way that an image can be simply consulted from a file, characterized in that a large number of panora¬ mic images are stored in digital form in a computer, as well as a lay out, on which the points are indicated, from which panoramic images are made and that administrative informati¬ on such as house numbers, street names, and place coordina¬ tes give access to a desired image and whereby the panoramic images can be divided up into arbitrary parts, for example a quadrant, dependant on the desired viewing direction from a particular shooting position.
9. A method according to claim 2, wherein the fish eye image is a photographic image on the center of which a pivoting image device is centered. 10. A method according to claim 2, wherein the panoramic image has an information density of approximately 1.9 megabyte, or in the order of magnitude of 8.8 megabyte or less.
