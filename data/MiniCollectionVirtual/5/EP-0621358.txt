<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cans 
exchanging system for replacing empty cans with 
full-loaded cans when cans disposed in a drawing frame, 
a roving frame or a spinning frame have become empty. Further, the present invention relates to 
a sliver piecing system whereby, when a certain can 
out of rows of cans disposed behind a spinning machine 
and containing sliver has become almost empty ("empty 
can" hereinafter) and when such an empty can is to be 
replaced with a can filled with sliver ("full-loaded 
can" hereinafter), an end portion of sliver ("old sliver" 
hereinafter) from the empty can to the spinning machine 
and that of sliver ("new sliver" hereinafter) contained 
in the full-loaded can are pieced together. According to the prior art, when the cans 
disposed in a drawing frame, a roving frame or a spinning 
frame have become empty, a worker gets in between the 
empty cans and replaces them manually with full-loaded 
cans which are arranged, for example, behind the empty 
cans. In the case where the spacing between cans 
arranged in the longitudinal direction of the body of 
a drawing frame, a roving frame or a spinning frame 
(hereinafter referred to also as "spinning machine")  
 
is large, it is possible for a worker to enter between 
the cans and perform a manual replacement of cans. 
However, in the case where the said spacing is narrow 
and cans are arranged in plural rows in the longitudinal 
direction of the spinning machine, it is very difficult 
to conduct a manual replacement of cans, and a 
considerable time will be required for the replacement. 
Further, where the spacing between adjacent spinning 
machines is made narrow to permit arrangement of a larger 
number of spinning machines, it is difficult to carry 
in large cans manually between the spinning machines 
and it is also difficult to carry in a large-sized 
working car which carries cans thereon. Heretofore there has not been known a cans 
exchanging system capable of effecting efficiently and 
rapidly the replacement of cans in a spinning machine 
in which the cans are arranged through a narrow spacing 
and in plural rows in the longitudinal direction of 
the spinning machine. According to the prior art, when a worker 
has confirmed a substantially empty condition of a sliver 
can, the worker stops the operation of the spinning 
unit concerned, then enters the space behind the spinning 
machine and pieces the old and new slivers together 
manually. According to the prior art, in the case of 
replacing empty can and
