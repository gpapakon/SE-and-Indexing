<ABSTRACT>
The device for forming a fracture slit in the 
pilferproof ring (3) in screw caps (1) made of plastics has 

a mandrel (22) on which the cap (1) is placed. The mandrel 
(22) is provided with teeth (30) that engage retaining 

teeth (9) formed inside the ring (3) whereby to cause the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for forming 
a fracture slit in the pilferproof ring in screw caps made 
of plastics. Screw caps made of plastics are commercially known for 
closing containers; they are composed of a cup that is 
internally threaded so that it can be screwed on a threaded 
portion of the neck of the bottle and is provided with a 
pilferproof ring separated from the cup by means of a 
series of peripheral slits divided by narrow bridges. The pilferproof ring is internally provided with a 
plurality of mutually angularly equidistant teeth or 
elastic tabs. The teeth extend inward so that they can 
engage below a collar formed on the outside of the neck of 
the bottle. In this manner, when the cap is unscrewed from the 
container, the pilferproof ring, by abutting against the 
collar, separates from the cup along the fracture line 
constituted by the slits and remains attached to the 
container. A cap of this type is disclosed for example in 
US patent no. 4,343,754. Metal screw caps are known which have a plurality of 
axial slits formed on the pilferproof ring; when the cap is 
unscrewed, these slits allow the ring to break into 
segments that remain attached to the edge of the cup. The angular position of the axial slits in metal caps 
is fully random, since it is not conditioned by the 
constructive characteristics of the cap. Transfer of such a  
 
slitting method to caps made of plastics is not possible, 
since it is necessary to prevent the slits from forming at 
the internal retaining teeth. However, the currently 
developing trend of recovering used containers requires 
these containers made of plastics to be returned without 
the pilferproof ring attached to the neck of the container. The technical aim of the present invention is to 
provide a device that allows to form slits between the 
teeth of a screw cap made of plastics to fracture the 
pilferproof rings and remove them when the cap is 
unscrewed. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a device which is structurally 
simple and can be easily adapted to closures of various 
shapes. With the above aim and object in view, the invention 
provides a device for forming a fracture slit in the 
pilferproof ring of screw caps made of plastics having a 
cup and a pilferproof ring that is separated from the cup 
by a series of slits arranged along a circumference and 
mutually separated by mutually angularly equidistant 
bridges, a plurality of equidistant elements being formed 
inside

Device for forming a fracture slit (10) in the 
pilferproof ring (3) of screw caps (1) made of plastics 

having a cup (2) and a pilferproof ring (3) that is 
separated from the cup by a series of slits (7) arranged 

along a circumference and mutually separated by mutually 
angularly equidistant bridges (8), a plurality of 

equidistant elements being formed inside said ring (3), 
said elements comprising retention means (9) for engaging a 

collar of the container to fracture the bridges (8) and 
separate the pilferproof ring (3) from the cup (2) during 

the unscrewing of the cap; there being also an abutment 
(11) having a peripheral surface (15, 16) that forms an arc 

of a circle, and a blade (18) which is concentric with 
respect to said abutment (11) and protrudes from the 

peripheral surface of said abutment with its cutting edge 
(19), said cutting edge being provided with a plurality of 

notches (20) the mutual distance whereof corresponds to the 
mutual distance of said bridges (8); said device being 

characterized in that it comprises: at least one chisel 
(21) located at right angles to said blade (18) and 

angularly arranged at the region comprised between two 
successive notches (20); a mandrel (22) having its rotation 

axis at right angles to the plane of said blade (18), a 
crown (23) provided with an edge (28) in tangent contact 

with the cutting edge (19) of said blade (18), and a 
plurality of angularly equidistant peripheral traction 

teeth (30); said mandrel (22) being arrangeable 
eccentrically inside said cap so as to clamp the peripheral 

 
wall of said cup (2) and said ring (3) against the 

peripheral surface (15, 16) of said abutment (11), said 
mandrel (22) furthermore having a rotary motion to move a 

traction tooth (30) so that it engages one of said 
equidistant elements (9) and a translatory motion to roll 

the cap (1) on the peripheral surface (15, 16) of the 
abutment (11) with consequent slitting of the cap by said 

blade (18) and chisel (21), said translatory and rotary 
motions being mutually synchronized, whereby said chisel 

(21) slits the pilferproof ring (3) at a region comprised 
between two successive bridges (8). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said mandrel (22) is screwed with a threaded portion (27) 

in a hollow shaft (26) mounted on a carousel which rotates 
concentrically with respect to said abutment (11) and has a 

shoulder (25) to secure said crown (23) against the top of 
said hollow shaft (26), said crown (23) having a collar 

(28) that is co-planar to the blade (18) and is in tangent 
contact with said cutting edge (19) and multiple recesses

traction teeth (30) that are suitable to engage said 

retention means (9).

characterized in that the top of the mandrel (22) comprises 

a tang (32) constituting a support for a cap (1) and having

cutting edge (19) of the blade (18) is at the level between 
the cup (2) and the pilferproof ring (3). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises a plurality of 

equidistant chisels (21) so as to produce angularly 
equidistant axial slits (10) on the pilferproof ring (3) of
