<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a fabric-like laminate of creped tissue paper, which preferably is wet-strength-treated and a product manufactured according to said method, e.g. a table-cloth. During a first step an adhesive is applied to a first tissue paper web (9) in patterns to form a first web (A), said web in a second step being laminated to another tissue paper web (B) by means of a water-based adhesive compound containing a dispersion adhesive mixed with a large amount of filler, said compound making that the adhesive only penetrates a limited depth into the surface layer of the webs (A, B) directed towards each other at the same time as it gives the material in question a big binding strength. The product according to the invention contains at least two, preferably wet-strength-treated webs (A, B) of tissue paper laminated together, the surface layers of said webs being laminated and directed towards each other containing a water-based adhesive compound with a large amount of filler penetrated a limited depth into the respective said surface layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
a fabric-like laminate preferbly made of wet-strength-treated
tissue paper and a product manufactured according to
said method.It is previously known to manufacture a fabric-like material
of paper, in which a plastisol is used as a binder, and
quality supplying additional material to laminate two or
more layers of tissue paper, said material being suitable
for manufacturing table-cloths, having the desired qualities
as heaviness, drape, softness and tensile strength. An
important reason in using a plastisol is the fact that it
is not water-based, whereby those problems are avoided
which otherwise are associated with a strong wetting of
tissue paper webs.There is now an interest for environmental reasons to develop
alternative laminates manufactured by the aid of water-based
binders also having the above-mentioned qualities,
such as heaviness, drape, softness and tensile strength.However, during the development work problems have arisen
to manufacture well-functioning laminates, when water-based
binders are used for laminating creped tissue paper and the
manufacturing problems have been enormous. The wetting of
the paper has led to softening, swelling and defects in the
creping, which in turn has resulted in difficulties with
inter alia the guidance of the webs. The finished laminate
obtained has had disqualifying stiffness, which has not met
the requirements determined what concerns drape and softness. According to the present invention these drawbacks are
eliminated making it possible to manufacture a product
having - for the most part - corresponding quality properties
as the product previously known but which in turn
is much cheaper and simplier to manufacture and which
moreover is better what concerns the environment. The characterizing
features of the present invention are stated in
the enclosed claims.Since tissue paper used for manufacturing laminate for
table-cloths is negatively affected by strong wetting, the
development work has been directed in trying to eliminate
the negative effects which can arise in coating of water-based
adhesives.One way to eliminate the problems is to avoid disturbing
effect of the wetting even what concerns thin webs.By the aid of the development work this condition has now
been possible to achieve by certain essential measures
according to the invention, which on one hand per se and on
the other hand taken together give the desired result.Partial coating in patterns of preferably lines is one
possibility,

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a fabric-like laminate
of creped tissue paper, which preferably is wet-strength-treated

and which has the required qualities for e.g.
table-cloths, such as drape, heaviness, softness and tensile

strength, 
characterized in
 that in a
first step an adhesive is applied to a first tissue paper

web (9) in patterns to form a first web (A), said web in a
second step being laminated to another tissue paper web (B)

by means of a water-based adhesive compound containing a
dispersion adhesive mixed with a large amount of filler,

said compound making that the adhesive only penetrates a
limited depth into the surface layer of the webs (A, B)

directed towards each other at the same time as it gives
the material in question a big binding strength.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in
 that a water-based adhesive is applied to
the tissue paper web (9) in the first step preferably by

roller coating in the form of a spaced pattern to receive a
partial extension of the adhesive over the tissue paper web

having a strongly reduced negative wetting effect.
A method according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized
in
 that the pattern application in the
first step is made in the form of a square-line pattern

having preferably squared or hexagonal square-lines, which
extend transversely over the first tissue paper web (9) in

providing of smallest possible negative effect on the
creped, moisture-sensitive tissue paper web (9).
A method according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized
in
 that the pattern application is made in
the form of longitudinal lines in providing the largest

possible tensile strength in the longitudinal direction of 
the tissue paper web (9) after drying.
A method according to Claims, 1, 2 or 3,

characterized in
 that a second tissue paper
web (10) is laminated in the first step together with the

first tissue paper web (9) on which the adhesive is applied
in patterns, for forming the web (A), which after drying up

to a total web strength passes into the second step.
A method according to Claims 1 or 5, 
characterized
in
 that a thin plastic film (14) is inserted
in the first step between the two tissue paper webs

(9, 10) and is laminated to those.
A fabric-like laminate of creped tissue paper,
which preferably is wet-strength-treated and which has the

required qualities for e.g. table-cloths, such as drape,
heaviness, softness and tensile strength, 
characterized
in
 that it comprises at least two tissue paper
webs (A, B) laminated together, the surface layers of said

webs laminated and directed towards each other containing a
water-based adhesive compound with a large amount of filler

penetrated a limited depth into respective said surface
layer.
A laminate according to Claim 7, 
characterized
in
 that the water-based adhesive has a filler
in an amount which is variable between 10 and 120%, counted

on dry latex in the adhesive compound, said filler consisting
of for example dolomite, chalk, talc, barium sulphate,

titanium dioxide, kaolin or wood meal.
A laminate according to Claim 7, 
characterized
in
 that a plastic film (14) is laminated
between the tissue paper webs (9, 10; A, B).
