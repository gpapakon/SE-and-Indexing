<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to lubricating 
oils, a lubricating method and a working fluid composition 
for a fluorinated hydrocarbon based refrigerant 
compressors. More particularly, the invention relates 
to lubricating oils, a lubricating method and a working 
fluid composition for compressors using a fluorinated 
hydrocarbon-based refrigerant containing no chlorine 
atom, such as R32, R125, R134, R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), 
R143a, and R152a. Although the chlorine-containing fluorinated 
hydrocarbon-based refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons 
or hydrochlorofluorocarbons have been widely 
used as refrigerants in home refrigerators, air 
conditioners, refrigerators, and air conditioners, their 
uses will be limited for the purpose of protecting the 
environment. In place of these chlorine-containing 
fluorinated hydrocarbon-based refrigerants, non-chlorinated 
refrigerants (hydrofluorocarbons) are  
 
considered as promising replacing refrigerants. 
As typical compounds therefor, R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) 
is attracting public attention. As a 
lubricating oil suitable for the non-chlorinated 
refrigerant, mineral oil-based lubricants cannot be 
used. Under the circumstances, a number of polyol 
ester-based compounds and polyoxyalkylene glycol-based 
compounds (hereinafter abbreviated as "PAG"s) have been 
proposed. The lubricating oils (refrigerator-lubricating 
oils) used together with refrigerants have different 
required properties depending upon uses and use 
conditions. For example, the lubricating oils for car 
air conditioners are required to have good solubility in 
the refrigerant particularly on a higher temperature 
side, not to speak a lower temperature side. Since the 
car air conditioner is operated under severe and 
vigorously changing conditions, the lubricating oils are 
required to have higher lubricity and higher wear 
resistance for various metallic materials such as iron, 
copper, and aluminum. Among them, since the rotary type 
car air conditioner compressor needs to maintain higher 
sealingness as compared with a swash-plate type car air 
conditioner compressor, the former requires a lubricating 
oil to have a higher viscosity. Further, the car 
air conditioner compressor requires wear resistance,  
 
particularly for aluminum materials. It is needless to 
say that the lubricating oils essentially need lower 
pour points with respect to any use. The techniques for the lubricating oils for the 
non-chlorinated based refrigerants using a PAG as a base 
oil
