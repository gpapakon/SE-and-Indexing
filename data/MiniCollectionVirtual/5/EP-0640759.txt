<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a partially reinforced aluminium cast component comprising an aluminium casting and a spray-compacted aluminium reinforcing part at least partially enclosed, by being cast in, by the base material of the casting. The method for manufacturing such a component comprises the formation of a reinforcing element from spray-compacted material, the insertion of this element into the casting mould, the surrounding of the reinforcing element with an aluminium casting alloy and the solidification of the melt. A component of this kind is distinguished by the fact that a complete, strong material bond is present in the joints between the aluminium casting and the reinforcing part.

<CLAIMS>
Construction part (1), comprising an aluminium 
casting (2) and a reinforcing member (3), which is 

surrounded by the base material of said casting at least 
partially by integral casting, said reinforcing member 

being formed from a spray-compacted aluminium material and 
forming a full, solid composite material with the aluminium 

casting (2) in the joint zones. 
Method of producing a partially reinforced 
aluminium cast construction part (1) according to claim 1, 

characterised by the following method steps: 

providing a reinforcing member (3), which is formed 
from spray-compacted material and defines at least one 

portion of the finished construction part (1); 
inserting the reinforcing member (3), in a compact, 
solid form, into the intended space in the casting mould, 

which forms the construction part (1); 
filling the remaining space of the casting mould 
with the molten mass of the conventional cast aluminium 

material; and 
subsequently solidifying the molten mass. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the reinforcing member (3), formed from spray-compacted 

material, is configured as an extruded profile portion. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the reinforcing member (3), formed from spray-compacted 

material, is configured as a forged piece.  
 
Method according to claims 2 - 4, characterised in 
that the reinforcing member (3), inserted into the casting 

mould, is preheated. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the preheating temperature is so selected that the 

reinforcing member (3) is completely fused. 
Method according to claims 2 - 6, characterised in 
that the molten mass of cast aluminium is poured into the 

casting mould parallel to the surface of the reinforcing 
member (3) and at such a great speed that it washes away 

the oxide layer existing on the aluminium of the 
reinforcing member (3). 
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the washing operation is achieved by the selection of the 

sprue locations and/or by agitation and/or by the 
production of eddy currents by means of induction coils.
