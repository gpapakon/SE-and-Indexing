<ABSTRACT>
A separator device (1) for separating components of a mixture containing at least two such components, of which at least one component is formed by a fluid, and the separator device (1) having at least two zones (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4), of which one is provided for receiving each one of the components separated off, such as in particular distillation devices, preferably for fractional distillation, filtration devices, settling tanks and the like, a control device being provided to operate the separator device (1) or to guide an applied separation process, which control device has an analyser (16) for at least qualitative testing of at least one component separated in one zone (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4), a comparator (17) for comparing an actual signal derived from this qualitative testing with at least one stored preset signal functionally related to a predetermined separation quality, and at least one actuator (V, V', 10, 18, P, 30) controlled by the output signal of the comparator (17) for at least one operating parameter of the separator device (1). At least one spectrometer (16) which can preferably be operated and interrogated remotely is provided as analyser.

Separating installation for separation of components of a 
mixture containing at least two such components, at least one 

of the components being a fluid, the separating installation 
having at least two zones, each zone being provided for 

reception of one of the separated components respectively, a 
regulating means being provided for the operation of the 

separating installation (1, 21, 31) or for the conduct of the 
applicable separating process, the regulating means having an 

analysis means (16) for at least qualitative testing of at 
least one separated component in a zone (4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 

27, 36', 37), a comparator means for an actual value signal 
derived from this test with at least one desired value signal 

that is stored and has a functional relationship with a 
predetermined degree of separation, and at least one adjustment 

means (V, V', 10, 18, P, 30) controlled by the output signal of 
the comparator means (17) for at least one operating variable 

of the separating installation (1, 21, 31), at least one 
spectrometer (16), which can preferably be remote controlled 

and remote interrogated, being provided by way of the analysis 
means for the chemical analysis. 
Separating installation according to claim 1, wherein one 
or more spectrometers (16) are provided for qualitative testing 

of the separated components in the different zones (4, 5.1, 
5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 27, 36', 37), the actual value signals derived 

from the one or more spectrometers (16) being selectively fed 
to the comparator means and compared with relevant stored 

desired value signals. 
Separating installation according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a single spectrometer (16) is employed 

for qualitative testing of a plurality of components, 
means (28, 38, 39) being provided for sequential testing by 

this single spectrometer of the separated components of 
distinct zones (36', 37).  

 
Separating installation according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the means for sequential testing of a 

plurality of separated components has a beam deflection 
means (39) arranged between a photoelectric sensor of the 

spectrometer (16) and the individual zones (36', 37) which, 
preferably motor driven, in timewise succession, establishes 

the beam path between the spectrometer (16) and the 
predetermined zones (36', 37) or the separated components. 
Separating installation according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the beam deflection means (39) is 

equipped with a position message device such as an angle 
transmitter, whose signals are provided as address signals for 

analysis signals. 
Separating installation according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that there are arranged structurally 

integrated: the comparator means (17) for the actual value 
signal of each spectrometer (16) with a desired value signal; 

and preferably at least one control stage and/or switching 
stage to form a regulating value as an indirect control signal 

for at least one means for varying an operating variable, for 
an evaluating means (117) that can be actuated by an 

operative. 
Separating installation according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that for varying at least one operating 

variable, at least one change over means such as a valve (V), a 
throttle valve, a diverter, is provided in the conduit (6, 36)

Separating installation according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the separating installation (1) is 

provided with at least one heating means (18) controlled by the 
evaluating means.
