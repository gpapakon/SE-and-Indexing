<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for activating one or more light-generating device (2) belonging to a defined space (1) in a contactless fashion when a first person enters the defined space, and to deactivate the light-generating device (2) when the first person, or a last person, leaves the space. The arrangement includes a sound-wave receiving means (5) which when detecting sound waves that lie within a predetermined first frequency band initiates activation of the light-generating device (2) and which initiates deactivation of the light-generating device (2) when no sound waves that lie within the frequency band are detected. The sound-wave receiving means is constructed to detect sound waves of extremely low frequency within a predetermined narrow frequency band (0-5 Hz) and/or variations in air pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement which in
response to a first person entering a defined space in
which one or more light-generating devices are installed
will function to activate the light-generating device/devices
in a "contactless fashion" and to deactivate
said light-generating device/devices after a given
time period has lapsed, preferably a predetermined time
period, from the moment that said first person or a last
person leaves said defined space.The invention is based on the known technique of utilizing
to this end sound-wave receiving means which will
initiate activation of the light-generating device(s)
upon detection of sound waves that lie within a predetermined
first frequency band and converesely initiate
deactivation of said light-generating device(s) in the
absence of the detection of sound waves that lie within
said frequency band.Several different "passive presence detection means" are
known to the art and utilize different technical devices
for their intended function.One example is the use of detectors which sense passive
infrared beams and which are adapted to detect the
thermal energy that radiates from all warm-blooded
creatures. Another technique on which the present invention is
based is one in which sound waves that occur within the
defined space, preferably sound waves that are generated
therein, are detected, including the levels of said
sound waves.In this regard, it is known to select from the frequency
spectrum of the sound generated those freqencies which
lie within a predetermined first frequency band and to
activate the light-generating devices with the aid of an
electrically operated a switch and thrcugh the medium of
apropriately adapted filters and amplifiers.The amplifier used includes time delay circuits which
when the aforesaid sound waves have ceased to exist or
lie beneath said first frequency band function to deactivate
the light-generating devices after a given delay
time has lapsed.The following publications constitutes part of prior
art.Patent publication US-A-4 344 071 discloses an
arrangement comprising sound-wave receiving means
detecting sound-waves including the infrasonic
wavelength, which operates to actuate a household
lighting fixture in response to a sensed environmental
condition such as sound or movement within a room.Patent publication EP-A1-0 093 810 discloses an
arrangement for contactless activating and deactivating
light generating devices based upon the use of a sound-wave
receiving means constructed to detect sound-waves

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for activating at least one light-generating
device (2) installed in a physically defined

space (1) in a contactless fashion when a first person
enters said space, and for deactivating said light-generating

at least one device (2) when said first, or a
last, person has left the space (1), said arrangement including

sound-wave receiving means (5) which when detecting
sound waves that lie within a predetermined first frequency

band functions to activate said at least one
light-generating device (2) and to initiate deactivation of

said light-generating device when no sound waves that
lie within said first frequency band are detected,
characterized
 in that the sound-wave
receiving means (5) is constructed to detect sound waves

appearing within said first frequency band, as well as within a
second frequency band, where these two frequency bands

are separated by a third frequency band which
is representative of background noise, wherein no sound-waves

are detected for activation or deactivation.
An arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized
 in that the first frequency band is
higher than 500 Hz and the second frequency band is

lower than 15 Hz, preferably lower than 5 Hz.
An arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized
 in that activation as a result of sound
waves which lie in the second frequency band results in

activation of said at least cne light-generating device (2)
within a predetermined delay time. 
An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 3,

characterized
 in that activation of the at least
one light-generating device (2) in response to sound waves

which lie within the first frequency band is effected
with an activation tine that lies within a predetermined

delay time.
An arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized
 by a microphone unit (10) which is connected
to a first preamplifier (11) adapted to the first frequency

band and to a second preamplifier (12) adapted to the second
frequency band, and in that the preamplifiers are connected

to a control unit (17) through the medium of associated
filter units (13, 14).
