<ABSTRACT>
Conjugates between one or more repeated subunits of an antigen and a carbohydrate 
polymer are desired. Also described are immunogenic vaccines against disease states 

which contain the conjugates and methods for inducing cell-mediated immune responses. 
The conjugates may especially contain polymers of the carbohydrate mannose and one 

or more repeated subunits of human mucin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the immunotherapy of disease states, and in particular, but not
exclusively to the immunotherapy of carcinomas.Cancer is a major cause of death and severe trauma in modern society. Cancer is no
respecter of persons as the young, old, males, females and peoples of all races may
contract cancer, although cancer in children is relatively rare, perhaps with the
exception of childhood leukemia. In western society, cancer of the colon and lung
cancer are major diseases. In women, breast cancer is the most common form of
cancer.Many cancers are accompanied by overproduction of human mucin. Mucins are heavily
glycosylated proteins (greater than about 100Kd) which are produced by many epithelial
cells and tumours (1). Mucins found on cancer cells are different in some respects to
those on normal epithelial cells, in that some mucins have a deficiency in their
carbohydrate coat which leaves the protein core exposed. (2). There are seven forms
of known human mucin designated MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5 MUC6 and
MUC7 (3, 4, 26, 27). MUC1 is the most ubiquitous. The various mucins all have
very similar properties, that is, they are transmembrane glycoproteins, all having a
variable number of repeated amino acid sequences, which have a high content of serine,
threonine and proline. Overproduction of aberrantly glycosylated mucins (either non-glycosylated
or a deficiency in glycosylation) is characteristic of tumours of the breast,
ovary, pancreas, colon, lungs, prostate and other tumours of secretory tissue. The
cDNA sequences of the respective protein cores of the human mucins MUC1 to MUC7
have been cloned and characterized and have been found to contain highly repetitive
central portions of varying numbers of repeats of particularly amino acid motifs (known
as VNTR's). By way of example, MUC1 consists of unique amino and carboxyl
terminal sequences separated by a highly repetitive central portion containing forty to
eighty tandemly arranged copies or repeats of a twenty amino acid motif The VNTR's
of MUC1 through MUC7 are set forth below:

amino acid sequence of this repeat unit has not been fully characterized. The MUC7
