<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate material separating
apparatus, having a horizontal beam movable up and down, a
plurality of vacuum hanger members fixedly arranged at regular
intervals on both sides of said horizontal beam so as to extend
horizontally, and a plurality of support vacuum pad devices
attached to each of said vacuum hanger members at regular
intervals in a direction perpendicular to an end surface of a
plate material and to a plate material separating apparatus
including vacuum hanger members extending horizontally, a
plurality of manipulating devices mounted on said vacuum hanger
members, a plurality of vacuum pads mounted on said
manipulating devices respectively, said plurality of
manipulating devices having first and second devices, said
first device is one of said plurality of manipulating devices
being disposed near to the edge of the plate material.Such plate material separating apparatuses are known from GB-A-1
547 776.Since all suction elements are operating simultaneously due to
adhering forces, it is not ensured to always reliably separate
the plate materials.Further, document GB-A-1 531 509 discloses an apparatus for
lifting panels or the like from a pile with the use of at least
four suction holding elements acting on the uppermost panel
from above the pile at the front edge thereof which is adjacent
to further processing installations and with the use of a
device for running under the panel concerned and displacing it
towards the further processing installations, two outer suction
holding elements being disposed at an angle to the two side
edges respectively and also to the front edge of the pile, and
the suction elements situated between the two outer suction
holding elements being disposed only at an angle to the front
edge of the pile, wherein the suction holding elements are
capable of being controlled individually, in pairs or as an
integral unit, in such a manner that in use only the corners of
the front edge of a said panel may be at first lifted. However, this apparatus especially the suction means is rather
complicated due to the requirement of air tightness in all
positions of said suction means or pad.Moreover, document DE-A-34 24 815 discloses an air nozzle or
air blow means for further separating plate materials already
being separated along one edge.In another conventional plate material separating
apparatus, a plurality of vacuum pads are arranged on each
of a plurality of vacuum hangers fixedly arranged at
regular intervals on both sides of the
