<ABSTRACT>
Laser-modulator monolithic integrated component with a multiple quantum well structure. This component comprises a InP substrate, a laser (L) formed by a stack of semiconductor layers grown epitaxially on this substrate, including an active layer (18), and a periodic Bragg grating (12) fixing the emission wavelength of the laser to a value slightly greater than the optimum wavelength of the gain peak of the laser; an electrooptic modulator (M) formed from this same stack of semiconductor layers, including an absorbing layer (18), with the exception of the Bragg grating, the active layer of the laser and the absorbing layer of the modulator both being formed by the same epitaxially grown structure with several quantum wells, which are constrained (strained) or unconstrained (unstrained), the modulator functioning according to the confined Stark effect, and means for electrically controlling the semiconductor layers of the laser and those of the modulator.

<CLAIMS>
Integrated, monolithic electrooptical component comprising an InP monocrystalline 
substrate (10), a laser (L) having a stack of semiconductor layers 

epitaxied on several quantum wells (18a) on said substrate, including an active 
layer (18) and a periodic Bragg grating (12) fixing the emission wavelength 

of the laser, an electrooptical modulator (M) formed by said stack of semiconductor 
layers epitaxied on several quantum wells (18a) on said substrate, 

said active layer (18) forming an absorbing, active layer, means (26, 28, Vd) 
for applying to the laser layer stack a positive voltage leading to the emission 

by the active layer of the laser of a radiation traversing the absorbing 
active layer of the modulator in the plane of said layer, means (26, 30) for 

applying to the stack of layers of the modulator a negative voltage leading to 
an absorption of said radiation by the absorbing active layer, characterized 

in that the spacing of the periodic Bragg grating (12) is adjusted to a given 
value fixing the emission wavelength of the laser to close to 155 Âµm and 

exceeding the wavelength corresponding to the maximum of the laser gain peak 
and in that the modulator has, in the absence of a negative voltage applied to 

the modulator layer stack, an absorption peak at said gain peak maximum, the 
modulator then not being absorbing for the laser emission wavelength and, in 

the presence of said reverse voltage, an absorption peak displaced towards a 
wavelength higher than that of the laser emission wavelength as a result of the 

confined Stark effect, the modulator then becoming absorbing for the laser 
emission wavelength. 
Component according to claim 1, characterized in that the wells are 
constrained. 
Component according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the semiconductor 
layers are aluminium-free. 
Component according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the active layer and the absorbant layer are formed from undoped, InGaAsP or 

InGaAs quantum wells (18a) separated by undoped InGaAsP or InGaAs barrier 
layers (18b), the In and P composition being chosen in such a way that the 

wells have a forbidden energy band below that of the barrier layers.
