<ABSTRACT>
A method for extracting thermal energy for use in a heat distributing plant, for instance a district heating system, from a generator plant having a generator, which is air-cooled by means of a cooling ventilator and driven by means of an internal combustion engine, according to which method thermal energy from the cooling system and exhaust gas are transferred to the district heating system, and in which the internal combustion engine is enclosed in a sound-absorbing, ventilated cabinet. With a view to being able to exploit the heat transferred to the ventilation air through direct heat exchange with the water in the district heating system, the generator is supplied by cooling air from an external cooling ventilator, and the cooling air outlet is supplied to the cabinet, where it constitutes the whole amount of ventilation air or an essential part thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for extracting 
thermal energy for use in a heat distributing plant 
and of the kind stated in the preamble of claim 1, as well 
as to a combined heat and power plant for performing the 
method. Heat distributing plants are normally supplied with 
thermal energy from a boiler fired by coal, oil or gas, but 
recently heat distributing plants have been built or 
planned, in which a major or smaller part of the thermal 
supply derives from cooling of an internal combustion engine 
driving a generator coupled in in the public electricity 
supply system. The most common form of such heat distributing 
systems supply district heating to dwelling houses, and 
in the following the term district heating system is used 
generally about such heat distributing plants. It is normal 
practice to equip smaller generators with a shaft-driven 
ventilator, which is normally somewhat oversized and which 
circulates the air surrounding the generator around its 
electrical windings. To attain sufficient cooling the 
ambient air should be kept at a comparatively low level. To 
avoid noise nuisances the generator and the motor are 
usually placed in the same sound-absorbing cabinet, and it 
should therefore be ventilated to such an extent that 
sufficient cooling of the generator is attained. In the 
plant thus outlined, the heat, which is present in the used 
ventilation air, will be discarded due to the fact that it 
is present at a temperature level, at which it cannot be 
exploited in the district heating system without a heat 
pump. The heat loss, which has up til now been accepted in 
such a combined heat and power plant, amounts to approx. 12 
- 15% of the effect fired into the plant, but even though  
 
the loss is considerable, it has on account of the low temperature 
level of this amount of heat not been considered 
profitable to recover it. From the specification to US Patent No. 4,680,478 a 
gas engine generator plant with heat recovery built in in a 
closed, sound-absorbing cabinet is known. In this plant a 
ventilator ensures the presence of a cooling air flow in the 
cabinet, the cooling air passing in its flow path in series 
condensing heat exchangers for exhaust gas from the engine, 
the generator, the cooling ribs of the motor and a primary 
exhaust gas cooler. The cooling air is supplied in comparatively 
big amounts to ensure an effective cooling of the various 
components, and the cooling air outlet therefore only 
reaches a temperature of approx. 55Â°C, which is
