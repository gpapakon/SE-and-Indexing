<ABSTRACT>
A grand-piano like keyboard instrument is equipped 
with an electronic sound producing unit for selectively 

entering into an acoustic sound mode and an electronic 
sound producing mode, and a stopper (701) blocks sets of 

strings (4a) from hammers (324) in the electronic sound 
producing mode for producing synthesized tones only, 

wherein a gap regulating unit (705) changes gaps between 
the toes (311) of jacks (309) and regulating buttons (305) 

depending upon the mode so that hammer shanks (322) are 
brought into contact with stopper (701) after the escapes 

of the jacks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a grand piano-like keyboard
instrument and, more particularly, to a grand piano-like
keyboard instrument for selectively producing acoustic
sounds and synthesized sounds.A typical example of a grand piano equipped with a
muting mechanism is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Publication of Unexamined Application (Kokai) No. 51-67732,
and the muting mechanism restricts a hammer motion with an
elastic member. Namely, when a player depresses a key, the
associated hammer is driven for rotation toward a set of
strings, and concurrently strikes the elastic member and
the strings. Then, the elastic member takes up part of the
kinetic energy of the hammer so that the sound is lessened.
In other words, the elastic member aims at reduction of
impact against the strings, and the muting mechanism gives
rise to decrease of loudness of acoustic sounds.Of course, if the elastic member is spaced farther
from the strings, the elastic member blocks the strings
from the hammer, and the hammer does not strike at the 
strings. However, the elastic member thus spaced father
from the strings destructs the unique key-touch. Namely,
when the hammer butt is escaped from the jack, the hammer
head usually reach vicinity of the strings as close as 2
millimeters. If the elastic member is spaced farther, the
hammer is liable to be brought into contact with the
elastic member before the escape from the hammer butt, and
the player feels the key-touch strange.On the other hand, if a tuner advances the regulating
button toward the jack, the hammer butt is escaped from the
jack earlier, and the hammer is brought into contact with
the elastic member after the escape from the jack. As a
result, the escape gives a kind of key-touch to the player.
However, the key-touch is still different from that of an
acoustic piano, and the player feels the key-touch strange.Moreover, when a player moves the elastic member out
of the orbit of the hammer head for an ordinary
performance, the jack merely give a weak rotational force
to the butt due to the early escape, and the hammer head
softly strikes the strings. The soft strike results in
harpsichord-like sounds. Additionally, the motion of the
hammer is slow, and weakly rebounds on the strings. This
means that the hammer can not respond to a quick 
repetition.Another prior art is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
2,250,065, and the keyboard disclosed in the United States
Patent previously lifts the hammer assemblies for producing
gaps between the jacks and the hammer rollers.
