in the region of the paint bath (1).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised by having a device (21) which is arranged to

effect at least local removal of paint on the pallets (5).
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterised in that the
paint removal device (21)comprises a brush (48) disposed

transverse to the direction of movement of the pallets.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that a paint dryer (8) is located next to

the paint bath (1).
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterised in that the
pallet conveyor comprises a part (2, 5) guided continuously

through the paint bath (1) and a part (5, 7) guided
stepwise through the paint drier (8) and in that a transfer

device is disposed between said two parts (2, 5; 5, 7).
Apparatus according to claim 13, characterised in that the
transfer device (6) comprises a parallelogram-guided swing

frame (34, 35, 37, 38) having holding devices (40, 42)
