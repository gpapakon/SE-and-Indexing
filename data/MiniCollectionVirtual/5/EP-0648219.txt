Nod factor, termed NodNGR-type factor, of
the general formula (I) hereinbelow:



in which:

R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 represent a hydrogen atom, a
carbamoyl group or an acetyl group;
R
5
 represents the aliphatic chain of a fatty
acid;
n is between 1 and 4,

and wherein:

one or more of the substituents R
1
, R
2
 or R
3

is a carbamoyl group, and/or
R
4
 represents a methyl group, and/or
R
6
 represents a monosaccharide or an oligosaccharide,
optionally substituted, and linked to the

glucosamine by a glycosidic linkage.
Nod factor as claimed in claim 1, wherein
R
5
 represents the aliphatic chain of a C
10-24
, preferably
a C
14-20
, fatty acid.
Nod factor as claimed in claim 2, wherein
R
5
 is the aliphatic chain of vaccenic acid or palmitic
acid.
Nod factor as claimed in any of claims 1 to
3, wherein R
6
 is selected from amongst the monosaccharide 
group comprising optionally substitued fucose and

optionally substituted arabinose.
Nod factor as claimed in claim 4, wherein
R
6
 has the general formula (II)


in which:

R
7
 and R
8
 represent a hydrogen atom, an
acetyl group or a sulfate group,
R
10
 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl
group.
Nod factor as claimed in claim 5, wherein
R
7
 is a hydrogen atom and R
8
 a sulfate group.
Nod factor as claimed in claim 5, wherein
R
7
 is an acetyl group and R
8
 a hydrogen atom.
Nod factor as claimed in claim 5, wherein
both R
7

Process for the preparation of NodNGR-type
factors as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, which process

comprises a step in which at least one strain of

Rhizobiaceae
 producing said Nod factors is cultured, and
a step in which said NodNGR factors are purified from the

culture.
Process as claimed in claim 9, wherein
this strain is a strain which overproduces NodNGR factors

and comprises at least one plasmid having one or more
regulator genes 
nodD
