<ABSTRACT>
Adjacent touch-sensitive modules (10) together define a row of modifiable Braille cells (11), opposite a row of microswitches (50) and a row of caps (30). The latter each define a pivoting tab (32) controlling the corresponding microswitch, this tab being linked by a hinge (36) thinning out to a fixed part (31) carrying a region for displaying fixed information in Braille (40). At the free end of each tab (32), a curved-over hook part (35) forms a travel limiter with the underside of the associated microswitch (50). On the reverse of each tab (32), a cylindrical transverse projection provides an on-line contact with the microswitch (50). Considered transversely, the series of pivoting tabs (32) exhibits a sinusoidal profile, which makes it possible selectively to actuate a single tab with a large finger. And each tab (32) is fitted with a longitudinal guide groove, for guiding the finger.

Device forming an interactive Braille machine for blind 
persons comprising a row of tactile modules (10) placed 

side by side widthways to define together a row of 
modifiable Braille cells (11), the emergence of micro-pins 

in each cell being controlled electrically by the module 
concerned, and a row of contacts placed opposite the 

modifiable Braille cells, characterised in that the 
contacts are microswitches (50) and in that a row of caps 

(30) is provided, each of which defines a pivoting tab (32) 
controlling the corresponding microswitch, this tab being 

associated with a fixed part (31) bearing a display zone 
for fixed information in Braille (40) relating to the 

modifiable Braille cell concerned. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
hinges (36) of the caps are of the tapered type. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that the display zone (40) holds a strip 

bearing, in the form of a Braille cell, embossed projecting 
circles and non-embossed circles, the two types of circles 

being filled differently by serigraphy such that the 
Braille cell can be read both by touch and visually. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that the microswitches (50) are mounted on 

a common printed circuit board (20) placed transversely 
over the row of modules. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
printed circuit board also has notches (22) for the passage 

of the back-curved end (35) of the pivoting part of the 
cap, and with holes (27, 28) which hold the feet (37) of 

the fixed part of the cap and the fixing screw (38).  
 
Device according to the previous claim, characterized in 
that the fixed part (31) of each cap has at least one 

fixing foot on the printed circuit board. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that each tab (32) has at its free end a 

back-curved lug (35) which forms a travel stop in 
cooperation with the underside of the associated 

microswitch (50). 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that the back of each tab (32) has a 

transverse cylindrical embossed section to ensure a linear 
contact with the microswitch (50). 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that viewed transversely, the row of 

pivoting tabs (32) has a sine-wave appearance which allows 
selective activation of a single tab with a finger of 

significantly larger diameter than the width of this tab. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that each tab (32) has a longitudinal 

guide rib which allows guidance of the finger for moving 
from the modifiable Braille cell to the fixed Braille 

information zone and vice versa.
