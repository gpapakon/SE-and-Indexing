<ABSTRACT>
Surgical prosthetic modular implants (10, 20, 30, 40) used singularly or stacket together are provided to support and fuse together adjacent vertebrae or to totally or partially replace one or more vertebrae in a vertebral column. The implants are rigid annular plugs (11, 21, 31, 41), dimensionally similar to normal vertebral bodies, have simplified oval or semi-oval shapes with ridged faces (12, 16, 22, 42) to engage adjacent vertebral bodies to resist displacement and allow bone ingrowth and fusion and to interdigitate with the ridges of an adjacent plug for modular stacking to allow variability of ultimate implant height. The implants can be provided in sets of different thicknesses and are internally grooved (24) to receive an upstanding connecting bar (15) to bind together the individual stacked implants into a stable unit (17, 25, 44). The annular implants have ample spaces (11d, 11e, 21f) to allow blood flow and packing of bone graft and are preferably made of a radiolucent material, preferably biocompatible carbon fiber reinforced polymers or are alternately made of traditional or thopaedic implant materials such as nickel, chromium, cobalt, stainless steel or titanium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inert rigid vertebral
prosthetic devices and methods for implanting the
devices between adjacent vertebrae to treat or prevent
back or neck pain in patients with ruptured or
degenerated intervertebral discs and for replacing
vertebral bodies damaged by fracture, tumor or
degenerative process. Specifically, the invention deals
with ring-like prosthetic plugs or discs used singly or
stacked together between vertebrae to form support
struts in the spinal column and having rigid surfaces
facilitating anchoring and providing valleys for bone
ingrowth from adjoining vertebrae. The rings are
bottomed on the opposing end faces of adjoining
vertebrae, are preferably oval shaped with
medial-lateral and anterior-posterior dimensions in the
same ratio as normal vertebral bodies, are supplied in
different heights to be used individually to replace a
single damaged intervertebral disc, have ridges to bite
into the vertebrae or to interdigitate to be securely
stacked together to the exact height required at the
time of surgery, have slots and hollow areas for packing
bone graft material, tool receiving means, and are
preferably radiolucent to allow visualization of the
bone healing postoperatively.While many types of vertebral prosthetic devices
have been proposed, the success ratio has been very low
and the surgical procedures have been very complicated
and traumatic to the patient. The surgical implant
devices and methods covered in my United States Letters 
Patents 4,743,256, 4,834,757 and 4,878,915 have greatly
improved the success rate and have simplified the
surgical techniques in interbody vertebral fusion. In
the procedures covered by these patents, biologically
acceptable but completely inert strut plugs are bottomed
in channels or grooves of adjoining vertebrae and
receive bone ingrowth which quickly fuses the structure
to the bone and forms a living bone bridge across the
fusion area.In particular, the document US 4,834,757 discloses surgical
prosthetic devices including a rigid inner plug sized and shaped
to fit opposed end faces of vertebrae in a vertebral column
and having top and bottom faces with peaks adapted to
bite into the end faces of the adjoining vertebrae and valleys
between the peaks to receive bone ingrowth. A central aperture
extends through said plug between the top and bottom faces,
which is to be packed with bone graft material.The preamble of claim 1 is based on the disclosure of said document.The document WO 90/00037 discloses an implant structure which
comprise

<CLAIMS>
A surgical prosthetic device adapted for fusing together vertebrae in a vertebral
column which includes at least one rigid inert plug (11) having top and bottom faces (11c) with peaks

(12b) adapted to bite into the end faces of the adjoining vertebrae and valleys (12c) between
the peaks to receive bone ingrowth, and said plug (11) having a height effective to provide a

strut between the vertebrae maintaining a desired space, a central aperture (11d) extending
through said plug (11) between the top and bottom faces, said aperture in the plug being

adapted to be packed with bone graft material (66), 
characterized in that
 said plug is sized and
shaped to at least partially adopt the cross-section of opposed end faces of vertebrae in a

vertebral column, wherein (i) said plug has peaks (12b) and valleys (12c) on bone contacting
faces (11) only, and (ii) said peaks and valleys of said top and bottom faces (12) of each of said plugs

fully mate together when said plugs are used in a stack.
A surgical prosthetic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said plug (11) is of
a shape selected from the group consisting of oval and semi-oval rings.
A surgical prosthetic device as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the
interior of said plug (11) is intersected by a bar (15, 32) in parallel to the side walls,

perpendicular to the bone contacting faces (11).
A surgical prosthetic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the top and the
bottom faces (12) of the plug (11) have diverging equally sloping side walls converging to

sharp peaks (12b), and relative wide valleys (12c) between the peaks (12b), and said side
walls being adapted to nest together to hold adjacent plugs in alignment.
A surgical prosthetic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said plugs (11)
have diametrically opposed internal grooves (14) receiving a connecting bar (15) in parallel to

the longitudinal axis of said stack. 
A surgical prosthetic device according to one of the preceding claims, wherein

said plug (11) is composed of a radiolucent plastics material.
A surgical prosthetic device according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
said plug (41) has an anterior portion higher than a posterior portion to provide a wedging

effect when inserted into position between the vertebrae.
A surgical prosthetic device according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
the internal slots of said prosthetic device are at least partially packed with bone graft material

(66).
A surgical prosthetic device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein
said plug includes a tool mounting means in a peripheral wall of the plug.
A surgical prosthetic device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein
the peaks (12b) have side walls diverging at an angle of not substantially less than 30Â°.
