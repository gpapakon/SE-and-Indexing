<ABSTRACT>
A tubular connector for connecting a drilling tool assembly to a drill string for use in CTD 
operations. The connector has a fluid flow passage therethrough, and comprises: a first part 

including means for fixing to the drill string and a second part including means for fixing to 

the drilling tool assembly; inter engaging formations such as splines provided on the first 
and second parts such that, when engaged, said formations do not prevent relative axial 

movement of the first and second parts but prevent relative rotation thereof; a threaded 
collar provided around adjacent end portions of the first and second parts for axial location 

thereof when connected. The connector can also include a non-return valve assembly 
located in the fluid flow passage; a pressure actuated piston device in the fluid flow passage 

for disconnecting the drilling tool assembly from the drill string; and a pressure actuated 
valve which, when operated, allows fluid communication between the fluid flow passage 

and an exterior region of the connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector for connecting a drilling tool assembly to a drill
string. In particular the invention relates to a connector for connecting a bottom hole
assembly (BHA) to coiled tubing (CT) for coiled tubing drilling (CTD) operations.In CTD operations, a BHA comprising, inter alia, a downhole motor having a drill bit
connected thereto is made up to a CT string and drilling takes place by rotating the bit with
the downhole motor by pumping drilling fluid through the CT and applying weight to the
bit. In this respect, CTD operations are essentially the same as conventional drilling
operations with a downhole motor and drill pipe forming the drill string. However, since
CT is continuous, it is not necessary for the drilling to be interrupted to add more pipe to
lengthen the drill string. In CTD operations the CT drill string is advanced into the well or
withdrawn from the well using a CT injector head as is common in CT operations.
Consequently, it is unnecessary to have a derrick or mast, draw works and rotary table or
top drive to handle or drive the drill string as in conventional rotary drilling.In drilling operations, the drill string and BHA can become stuck for a variety of reasons
which are generally considered as mechanical sticking or differential sticking. In such
cases, the overpull required to free the drill string or BHA is greater than that available from
the rig. While certain remedial operations are available, it is often the case that it becomes
necessary to back off and to retrieve the stuck tool in a fishing operation. With a
conventional pipe drill string, this is done locating the stuck point in the drill string with
an appropriate wireline tool inside the drill string and then lowering an explosive charge to
the level of the pipe joint above the stuck point. This charge is detonated while a torque is
applied to the string to unscrew this joint and allow the free part of the drill string to be
withdrawn from the well. CTD operations differ in that there are no pipe joints to
disconnect nor is it normally possible to apply torque to the drill string since there is no
rotary drive at the surface. In addition, running in of a wireline tool or explosive cutter
would require first cutting the CT at the surface. Sticking is encountered in non-drilling CT
operations and it is normally the tools connected to the CT which become stuck. Consequently, the connector often includes a disconnect mechanism which can be actuated
by pumping fluid through the CT, often in
