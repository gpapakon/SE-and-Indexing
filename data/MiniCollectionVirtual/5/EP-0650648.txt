<ABSTRACT>
A communications system includes a receiver and a transmitter for transmitting a communications signal to the receiver. The transmitter adjusts its transmission power level in response to receiver power control signals transmitted by the receiver. The receiver includes an attenuator for attenuating the received communications signal, and measurement means for measuring the signal strength of the attenuated signal. The measured signal strength is coupled to attenuator control means and to transmission power control means. The attenuator control means and the transmission control means adjust, respectively, receiver attenuation and transmitter power level so as to optimize system performance. This may include keeping the attenuated signal within the dynamic range of the receiver. This may also include eliminating disturbance signals by adjusting receiver attenuation to produce an effective dynamic range for receiving only signals having a signal strength level that is higher than the disturbance signal strength level, while at the same time increasing the transmission power level to keep it within the effective dynamic range of the receiver. The disturbance signal may be detected as an increased bit error rate of the received communication signal. The apparatus and method may also be applied to systems in which a plurality of receivers are coupled to a common antenna through a receiver multicoupler.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a receiver and a method for
receiving a communications signal according to the preamble of
claims 1 and 7, respectively. A receiver and a method of this
kind are known from US 4 777 653.In a typical telecommunications system, such as in a cellular
telephone system, a receiver is designed to function with
signals in a given signal strength range. This signal
strength range is referred to as the dynamic range of the
receiver. The lowest acceptable signal strength that can be
received is called the receiver sensitivity. The highest
acceptable signal strength that can be received is called the
blocking limit.In a cellular telephone system, the distance between a base
station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) varies as the mobile
station moves around within a cell. Consequently, in large
cells, the variations in received signal strength can be very
large. Sometimes, these variations are so large that they
cannot be compensated by varying the mobile station's transmit
power. In such cells, it would be useful for the receiver
dynamic range, that is, the signal level range defined by the
highest and lowest acceptable received signal levels, to be
changed/transposed in relation to the distance between the
base station and the mobile station.The receiver dynamic range may be transposed by placing an
attenuator between the antenna and the receiver. As attenuation
increases, both the lowest and highest acceptable
received signal strengths increase. Similarly, the receiver 
dynamic range is transposed downward as attenuation decreases.
This influence of attenuation on dynamic range is
illustrated in Figure 1. When attenuation is set at 0
decibels (dB), the receiver dynamic range 101 is defined by
the sensitivity 102 and the blocking limit 103 of the receiver
(not shown).If attenuation is increased to 3 dB, the receiver dynamic
range shifts to a new dynamic range 104, defined by sensitivity
105 and blocking limit 106, both of which are
substantially 3 dB higher than the respective sensitivity 102
and blocking limit 103 that existed when attenuation is only
0 dB. Similarly, if attenuation is increased to 6 dB, the
sensitivity 108 and blocking limit 109 are again increased,
yielding a new receiver dynamic range 107.In small cells, the distance between a mobile station and a
base station can be very small. This can lead to disturbances
in the receive band if there are large cells in the same area
as the small cell. These large cells may belong to the same
network as the small cell, or they
