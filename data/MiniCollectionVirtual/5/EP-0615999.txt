<ABSTRACT>
A shaped article of an aromatic heterocyclic copolymer 
can be produced by (a) reacting (i) an aromatic diaminodithiol 

compound, hydrogen atoms of thiol groups of the aromatic 
diaminodithiol compound being substituted with substituted or 

unsubstituted alkyl groups, and (ii) an aromatic diamino compound 
separately with (iii) a dicarboxylic acid derivative in an organic 

solvent to produce two types of oligomers; (b) reacting the two 
oligomers in an organic solvent to produce a precopolymer; (c) 

heating the precopolymer to cause a thiazole ring closure reaction, 
thereby producing the aromatic heterocyclic copolymer; (d) finely 

comminuting the aromatic heterocyclic copolymer to obtain fine 
powder; and (e) molding the powder at an elevated temperature to 

form an article of a desired shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
a shaped article of a rigid aromatic heterocyclic copolymer having
excellent heat resistance, mechanical properties, chemical
resistance, electric properties, etc., as well as high elongation and
high bending strength.It is known that polymers containing heterocyclic
repeating units such as thiazole rings, imidazole rings, oxazole rings,
oxazinone rings etc., have a high rigidity and excellent mechanical
strength, tensile modulus, heat resistance, etc. Therefore, it is
expected that these polymers are used as plastic substitutes for
metal materials alone or in combination with other engineering
plastics.However, the rigid aromatic polymer such as the
aromatic polythiazole generally has a poor solubility in organic
solvents, etc. due to its high rigidity, and it is soluble only in limited
kinds of strong acids such as methane sulfonic acid, chlorosulfonic
acid, etc. Also, it has only poor elongation and flexibility, meaning
that it is poor in moldability. Accordingly, it is difficult to mold the
rigid aromatic polymer without mixing with other materials.Also, even in the case of forming a composite material of
the rigid aromatic polymer and a matrix polymer, the above
problem of poor moldability still remains. Further, since the rigid
aromatic polymer does not show a good compatibility with the
matrix polymer, it is difficult to blend the rigid aromatic polymer
with the matrix polymer at a desired proportion. To overcome such problems, it is possible to introduce a
flexible moiety into the rigid aromatic polymer, thereby improving
the moldability of the rigid aromatic polymer. Also, to improve the
compatibility of the rigid aromatic polymer with the other polymer,
it is possible to introduce a moiety compatible with the other
polymer, which has the same structure as or a similar structure to
the repeating unit of the other polymer, into the rigid aromatic
polymer.One example of such an attempt is disclosed by Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 63-256622, which is a method of producing
an aromatic heterocyclic copolymer by reacting a particular
aromatic oligomer having a thiazole ring with a monomer having a
benzene ring provided with at least one carboxyl group and at least
one amino group in a polyphosphoric acid. The aromatic
heterocyclic block copolymers obtained by this method have rigid
molecular chain moieties and soft chain moieties.However, in the above method, the synthesis of the
aromatic heterocyclic copolymer is conducted while being heated
