<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the head includes, under a magnetoresistant element (MR), a conductive element (40), and, preferably, an additional magnetic layer (44) punched with an opening (46). The conductive element (40) is in series with the write coil and connected up in such a way that, in the magnetoresistant element, the magnetic field resulting from the passage of the current through the conductive element opposes the write leakage field. Application to the magnetic recording of information.

) of the magnetic circuit,
said coil being traversed by an electric current during a

writing phase, said current creating a writing magnetic field
(H1) in the magnetic circuit, part (H2) of said writing field,

known as the leakage field, traversing the magnetoresistant
element (MR), said head being characterized in that it also

comprises an electrical conductor element (40) placed beneath
the magnetoresistant element (MR) and connected in series

with the conductor coil (18) in a direction such that, in
writing, the current flowing in said conductor element (40)

produces in the magnetoresistant element (MR) a magnetic
field (H3) in the opposite direction to the leakage field

(H2) passing through the magnetoresistant element (MR).
Magnetic head according to claim 1, characterized in
that the electrical conductor element (40) is wider than

the magnetoresistant element (MR).
Magnetic head according to claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises an additional magnetic layer (44) connected

to the magnetic circuit (16

) and having an opening (46)
between the magnetoresistant element (MR) and the electrical

conductor element (40).
Magnetic head according to claim 3, characterized in
that the additional magnetic layer (44) has a thickness between

approximately 0.1 and approximately 5 Âµm. 
Magnetic head according to claim 3, characterized in
that the opening (46) of the additional magnetic layer (44)

has a width substantially equal to or smaller than the width
of the magnetoresistant element (MR).
