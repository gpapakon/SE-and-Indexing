<ABSTRACT>
In the karaoke system 1, a center 3 is connected to 
a plurality of karaoke terminals 5 by a coaxial cable 7. The 

center 3 divides the karaoke song data stored in the memory 
device 13 over several channels and transmits all the karaoke 

song data within a fixed time period in succession to the 
karaoke terminals 5 via the coaxial cable 7. This operation 

is performed regardless of whether or not a song is requested 
from one of the karaoke terminals 5. Whether the karaoke 

data transmitted in succession is data of a requested song is 
determined by the control portion 41 of a karaoke terminal 5. 

If so, karaoke performance processes are performed wherein 
the karaoke data is reproduced and the orchestral accompaniment 

and lyric image is output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission 
system wherein a central control device and a plurality of 
terminals are connected by a transmission line, the data 
transmission system being for transmitting information data 
from the central control unit to each terminal. Conventionally, there is known a data transmission 
system, wherein a center (central control unit) is connected 
to a plurality of terminals by a transmission line. The data 
transmission system is for transmitting information data 
including various types of information to a terminal from a 
center according to demands from the terminal side. An 
advantage of this type of data transmission system is that a 
memory device for prestoring data information need not be 
provided to each terminal, so that the terminals have an 
extremely simple construction. In the data transmission system, it can be proposed 
that transmission and reception of the information data is 
controlled by polling between the center and the terminal. 
That is, a polling signal is transmitted in succession from 
the center to the plurality of terminals. Each terminal is  
 
interrogated to determine whether the each terminal requests 
transmission of information data. When there is a 
transmission request at a terminal that has received the 
polling signal, the request data, which indicates the content 
and the like of the request, is transmitted from the terminal 
to the center. After the request data has been received at 
the center side, the desired information data is transmitted 
to the terminal. According to this method, however, because the data 
transmission system interrogates about the data transmission 
requests at all the terminals in succession, a transmission 
request made at a terminal will not be responded to until 
polling for all other terminals is completed. This will 
cause a problem in that a long time is required for the 
desired data to be transmitted from the center. 
Particularly, a large scale system with external transmission 
lines can have a great many terminals so that information 
data can not be transmitted quickly to individual terminals. It is therefore an objective of the present invention 
to overcome the above-described problems and to provide a 
data transmission system wherein a terminal can obtain 
desired information data with a short waiting time.
 
The present invention provides a data transmission system for 
transmitting, to each of a plurality of terminals,  
 
information which the each terminal desires to
