<ABSTRACT>
A process for converting a high-boiling component 
resulting from the reaction of an organochloride with 

silicon into commercially desirable monosilanes is 
described. The process comprises contacting the high-boiling 

component with hydrogen gas at a temperature within 
a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. Process yield may be improved 

by use of a catalyst selected from activated carbon, 
platinum metal, platinum supported on alumina, palladium 

supported on carbon, SbCl₅, H₂PtCl₆, BCl₃, AlCl₃ and AlCl₃ 
supported on a support material selected from carbon, 

alumina and silica. A preferred embodiment of the process 
is run at a gauge pressure of 1.7 to 6.9 MPa (250 - 1000 

psi). This process is preferential for the production of 
diorganodichlorosilane in relation to organotrichlorosilane 

in the monosilane product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for converting
a high-boiling component, resulting from the reaction of an
organochloride with silicon, into more commercially
desirable monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the
high-boiling component with hydrogen gas
at a gauge pressure of 1.7 - 6.9 MPa (250 - 1000 psi) at a temperature
within a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. Process yield is
improved by use of a catalyst selected from activated
carbon, SbCl5, BCl3, AlCl3
and AlCl3 supported on a support material selected from
carbon, alumina and silica.
A significant advantage of the present process
is that it is preferential for the production of
diorganodichlorosilane in relation to organotrichlorosilane
in the monosilane product.The high-boiling component of the present process
results from a process typically referred to as the "Direct
Process," where an organohalide is reacted with silicon in
the presence of a suitable catalyst to form monosilanes.
The Direct Process is described more completely in US-A
2,380,995 and US-A 2,488,487. It is the main commercial
process by which organohalosilanes (i.e. monosilanes), for
example dimethyldichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane are
formed. These organohalosilanes are reactive compounds
which can undergo numerous reactions to form a variety of
useful silicon containing compounds and polymers. In
typical commercial direct processes the process is optimized
to produce the diorganodihalosilane, since this particular
monosilane can be hydrolyzed to form polysiloxane polymers 
having a broad range of commercial applications. Polysiloxane
polymers are useful as heat transfer fluids,
lubricants and can be further processed to form silicone
elastomers, resins, sealants and adhesives.Operation of the Direct Process results not only
in the production of the desirable monosilanes, but also in
a high boiling component typically considered to be all
materials with a boiling point higher than the particular
diorganodihalosilane produced in the process. The high-boiling
component is a complex mixture that includes
compounds containing SiSi, SiOSi, SiCSi, SiCCSi and SiCCCSi
linkages in the molecules. Typical compounds found in a
high-boiling component are described in US-A 2,598,435 and
US-A 2,681,355. The high-boiling component may also
comprise silicon containing solids and soluble and insoluble
compounds of copper, aluminum and zinc.In current commercial operations for performing
the Direct Process, the high-boiling component can
constitute as much as ten percent of the
