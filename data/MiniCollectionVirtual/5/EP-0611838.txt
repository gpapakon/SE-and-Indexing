<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises an electrolytic cell (10), an anode (20) 
and a 

removable cathode (30) positioned within the cell and encircling the 
anode and electrical connectors such as (31) outside the cell for the 

cathode and the anode. The cell (10) includes an electrically 
conductive annular contact surface (11). Clamping means, such as in 

the form of a lid fitting in screw thread (13) are provided to clamp a 
deformable portion (32) of the cathode (30) against the contact surface 

(11) to complete an electrical connection from the cathode connector 
(31) to the cathode (30). The electrically conductive annular contact 

surface (11) is positioned to define an upper opening of the 
electrolytic cell through which the cathode (30) may be removed. The 

provision of the annular contact surface (11) in an upper part of the 
electrolytic cell (10) enables this surface to be above the level of 

the electrolyte in the cell in use, thus reducing the risk of 
leakage and corrosion. By providing the annular contact surface (11) 

at said upper opening, a large contact surface is assured, reducing 
the risks of a resistive connection occurring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver recovery unit for the 
electrolytic recovery of silver from solutions containing silver, in 
particular used photographic solutions such as fixing and bleach-fixing 
solutions. Electrolytic silver recovery from used photographic solutions is a 
common way to extend the life of such solutions. An apparatus is 
known from German patent specification DE 4007906-C1 (Kodak AG) for 
the electrolytic recovery of silver from solutions containing 
silver, the apparatus comprising an electrolytic cell, an anode and 
a removable cathode positioned within the cell and encircling the 
anode and electrical connectors outside the cell for the cathode and 
the anode. In this apparatus the cell includes an electrically 
conductive contact surface which defines an aperture in the side of 
the cell. The cathode is in the form of a graphite foil carried on 
a backing of polymeric material. Clamping means in the form of a 
bolt pass through the aperture and through a hole in the cathode to 
clamp the cathode against the contact surface to complete an 
electrical connection from the cathode to the cathode connector. In an electrolytic cell, the cathode electrical connection is of 
vital importance since the electrode is the basis for the cathodic 
reactions which are most important in a de-silvering apparatus. The 
electrical connection should make sure that enough current can flow 
to the cathode, without causing a significant ohmic voltage drop 
between the cathode connector and the cathode itself. The reason 
for this is that the controlling of the current is usually done by 
means of the potential on this cathode as one pole and a reference 
electrode or the anode as the other pole. The potential on the 
cathode is in the range of some hundred millivolts and should be 
measured with fair accuracy. For example, where an Ag/AgCl reference electrode is used, the 
potential between the cathode and the reference electrode is about 
400mV. When the unit is to perform optimally, meaning employing the  
 
maximum current without causing side reactions to occur, the 
potential should be measured with an accuracy of some millivolts. 
As a result any ohmic resistance between the cathode and the 
electrical current supply will cause a measurement fault. 
While the arrangement disclosed in DE 4007906 may provide a secure 
electrical connection between the cathode and its exterior 
connector, the contact surface is small and in use lies below the 
level of the electrolyte in the cell. This may
