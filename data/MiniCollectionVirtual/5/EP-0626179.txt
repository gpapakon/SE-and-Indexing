<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to lubricious coating 
compositions and methods of using said compositions. Medical articles such as surgical needles, 
catheters, cannulas, probes, endotracheal tubes, 
arteriovenous shunts, and thermometers are often 
inserted into a patient. To minimize discomfort to the 
patient, the external surface of the instrument 
typically is coated with a silicone lubricant so that 
the instrument slides or penetrates more easily into 
the patient. The silicone lubricant typically is applied to the 
external surface of the medical instrument by coating 
the surface of the instrument with a solvent in which 
the silicone is dissolved, and allowing the solvent to 
evaporate. See, for example, the descriptions of 
silicone lubricants and appropriate solvents for the 
lubricants in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,061,738 (Solomon et 
al.), 4,925,668 (Khan et al.), 4,844,986 (Karakelle et 
al.), 4,838,876 (Wong et al.), 4,806,430 (Spielvogel et 
al.), and 4,664,657 (Williamitis et al.), and European 
Patent Applications 494,648 (Granger et al.), and 
380,102 (Hattori et al.), which descriptions are hereby 
incorporated by reference. Low boiling organic solvents are preferred for 
dissolving the silicone lubricant. Solvents which have 
been used include 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane, 
Freon™ solvents, and heptane. The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is coming 
under increasing attack and regulation. See, e.g., 
"Ozone Treaty Tightened, CFC Substitutes Controlled," 
Chemical and Engineering News, p.5, (December 7, 1992).  European Patent Application 465,037 (Adenaert et 
al.) describes solvent compositions which include (a) a 
fluorine-free organic liquid, (b) a perfluorinated 
organic liquid, and (c) a co-solvent which is miscible 
with components (a) and (b). These compositions are 
said to have low ozone depletion potentials. Briefly, in one aspect, the present invention 
provides a nonflammable liquid composition, useful for 
applying a silicone lubricant to medical articles, 
comprising (a) a nonflammable, highly fluorinated 
organic compound, (b) a silicone lubricant, and (c) a 
fluorine-free solvent in which said silicone lubricant 
is soluble. Said highly fluorinated organic compound 
is sufficiently soluble in said fluorine-free solvent 
to render said fluorine-free solvent nonflammable. In another aspect, the present invention provides 
a method of preparing coated articles comprising 
coating said article with the composition of this 
invention. "Highly fluorinated organic compound", as
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A nonflammable liquid composition, comprising 

(a) a highly fluorinated organic compound 
selected from the group consisting of 

hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and 
chlorine-free perfluorocarbons, 
(b) a silicone lubricant, and 
(c) a fluorine-free solvent in which said 
silicone lubricant is soluble and in which is dissolved 

an amount of said highly fluorinated organic compound 
sufficient to render the composition nonflammable. 
The composition of Claim 1, wherein said 
highly fluorinated organic compound has a boiling point 

of from -50°C to 100°C, and said highly fluorinated 
organic compound contains from 40% to 83% by weight 

fluorine, and from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. 
The composition of Claims 1 or 2, wherein said 
highly fluorinated organic compound is selected from 

the group consisting of perfluoropentane, 
perfluorohexane, perfluoroheptane, perfluoro-N-methylmorpholine, 

and perfluoro-dimethylcyclobutane. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein said 
fluorine-free solvent has a boiling point of from 25°C 

to 150°C. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein said 
fluorine-free solvent is an alkane. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein said 
fluorine-free solvent is selected from the group

t-butanol, hexamethyldisiloxane, and isopropylether. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 to 6, wherein the 
boiling point of said fluorine-free solvent is at least 

38°C higher than the boiling point of said highly 
fluorinated organic compound. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein said 
composition comprises from 10% to 50% by volume of said 

highly fluorinated organic compound, from 50% to 80% by 
volume of said fluorine-free solvent, and from 1% to 

30% by volume of said silicone lubricant. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 to 8, wherein there 
is a sufficient amount of said highly fluorinated organic 

compound such that two layers are formed; a first layer 
comprising said highly fluorinated organic compound, a 

silicone lubricant, and a fluorine-free solvent in 
which said silicone lubricant is soluble and in which 

is dissolved an amount of said highly fluorinated 
organic compound sufficient to render the composition 

nonflammable, and a second layer consisting essentially

A method of applying a silicone lubricant to 
a surface of an article, comprising the steps of 


(a) coating a surface of said article with the 
composition of any one of Claims 1 to 9; and
