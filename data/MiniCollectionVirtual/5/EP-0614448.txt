<ABSTRACT>
A burner arrangement for heating glass melting tanks has a burner block (1) set into the wall of the glass meling tank, with an opening area (2) enlarged towards the inside of the glass melting end, and a burner lance whose longitudinal axis (15) is tiltable and whose end at the side of the burner block is provided with a burner nozzle (12) with a burner nozzle cap (13). In order to reduce the NOx content of the hot smoke gasses, the burner nozzle (12) is arranged in a nozzle bearing block (5) mounted on the free outer surface (4) of the burner block (1) and having an inner surface section (11) crowned so as to taper towards the burner block (1). The burner nozzle cap (13) is correspondingly crowned at its end section (14) at the side of the burner block, so that it may be set on the crowned inner surface section (11) of the nozzle bearing block (5).
