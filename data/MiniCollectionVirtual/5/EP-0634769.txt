<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improvement to a method of manufacture of a micropoint electron source, using a masking step for making the holes of the grid, by means of a mask having corresponding holes, the holes in the mask having sizes and shapes determined in order theoretically to lead to the obtaining of holes in the grid having sizes, shapes and positions lying within given tolerances, the tips of the micropoints being required to be located in the thickness of the grid, the improvement being characterised in that, after having produced an electron source according to the method:   - an assessment is made as to whether the source has an emission which is sufficiently homogenous and/or reproducible with another source, - if the emission of the source is judged unhomogenous and/or irreproducible, determination is made of the defects which lie at the cause of this unhomogenous emission and which are due to shapes, sizes or positions of the holes which fall outside the tolerances or to the fact that the tips of the micropoints do not lie in the thickness of the grid, - the mask used during the method is corrected in order to make the future sources fabricated by this method homogenous and/or reproducible, the correction leading to modification of these shapes and/or of the sizes of at least some of the holes in the mask and/or the number of holes in the mask in order to compensate for the defects previously determined by creating additional defects and/or holes.

Process for the production of a microtip electron source, the 
microtips (19) being electrically connected to at least one cathode 

conductor (3) and being located in holes (18) made in at least one electron 
extraction grid, the process using a masking stage for producing the holes in 

the grid (13) by means of a mask (30,40) having corresponding holes, the holes 
in the mask having given dimensions and shapes in order to theoretically lead 

to the obtaining of holes in the grid having dimensions, shapes and positions 
within the given tolerances, the apices of the microtips (19) being located 

in the thickness of the grid (13),characterized in that after producing an 
electron source according to said process: 


an evaluation is made to establish whether the source has an emission which 
is sufficiently homogeneous and/or reproducible and/or reproducible on another 

source, 
if the emission of the source is considered to be inhomogeneous and/or non-reproducible, 
a determination takes place of the defects leading to said inhomogeneous 

emission and which are due to shapes, dimensions or positions of the 
holes falling outside the tolerances or because the apices of the microtips 

are not located in the thickness of the grid, 
the mask used is then corrected in order to render homogeneous and/or 
reproducible the future sources produced by said process, the correction 

consisting of modifying the shapes and/or dimensions of at least certain holes 
in the mask and/or the number of holes in the mask in order to compensate for 

the previously determined defects by deliberately creating supplementary 
defects and/or holes, regularly distributed over the emissive surface in such 

a way that there is always the same number of micropoints emitting in optimum 
manner uniformly distributed over the entire source. 
Improvement according to claim 1, characterized in that if the defects 
are due to a variation outside the diameter tolerances of the grid holes, the 

mask (30) is corrected so as to provide it over its entire surface with holes 
(31,32,33) having diameters varying in accordance with a distribution making 

it possible to include these manufacturing defects. 
Improvement according to either of the claims 1 and 2,
  
 

characterized in that if the defects are due to the presence of oval grid 
holes, the mask (40) is corrected so as to provide it over its entire 

surface with circular holes (41) and oval holes (42), whose major axes are 
located in the direction of the minor axes of the oval holes of the defective 

grid, the circular and oval correcting holes being regularly mixed on 
the mask. 
Improvement according to any one of the claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that if the defects are due to an unsatisfactory positioning 

of the holes with respect to the grid (17) there is an increase in the number 
of holes (18) in the mask in such a way that the grid of the future sources 

will be provided with a number of holes equivalent to a satisfactory positioning 
of the holes with respect to the grid. 
Improvement according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the hole production process is a photolithographic process.
