<ABSTRACT>
A method of adjusting the height of the takeout 
mechanism in a glassware forming machine comprises setting a 

takeout arm of the mechanism at a predetermined angle by use 
of a jig member adjusting a piston and cylinder device so 

that it is in a predetermined lowermost position when the 
takeout arm is so set, using a second jig member appropriate 

to the desired height of the takeout mechanism with respect 
to a set of moulds, setting the whole mechanism to the 

appropriate height and adjusting a scale to indicate the 
height to which the mechanism is set.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method of setting up 
a takeout mechanism in a glassware forming machine. In glassware forming machines of the I.S. type, a gob 
of molten glass is supplied to a parison mould in which it 
is formed into a parison. It is then transferred by an 
invert mechanism from the parison mould to a blow mould in 
which it is blown into the shape of a container. The blown 
container is then removed from the blow mould to a cooling 
plate by a takeout mechanism. From the cooling plate the 
container is pushed out onto a conveyor by which it is 
removed from the machine. A takeout mechanism comprises a housing which is 
secured in a table of the glassware forming machine and 
comprises an upward extension which is supported in a 
bracket of the forming machine to assist in stabilising the 
mechanism. The take out mechanism comprises a piston and 
cylinder device in the housing, a rack connected to the 
piston, a takeout arm pivoted on the housing and linked to 
the rack by a gear, the arm having a pivot point from which 
a takeout head may be supported. In the operation of the mechanism, the arm is moved to 
bring the takeout head over the blow moulds by operation of 
the piston and cylinder to move the rack. The takeout head 
is then caused to grip the containers in the blow moulds, 
the rack operates to cause the arm to rotate through 180° to 
carry the container away from the blow moulds into position 
over the cooling plate and the containers are released. It will be understood that it is very important to have 
the takeout head accurately positioned with respect to the  
 
blow mould so that the finishes of the formed containers are 
properly gripped by fingers of the takeout head. Different 
sets of moulds may be of different heights - the significant 
measurement is the invert height, which is the distance 
between the upper surface of the blow moulds in position in 
the machine and a horizontal plane passing through the axis 
of the invert mechanism. Different moulds have different 
invert heights. The present method of setting up take out mechanisms 
comprises the following steps :- 
1 The operator adjusts a stop which is at the lower end 
of the piston and cylinder device to bring the takeout arm 
into a horizontal position, as judged by eye. 2 The operator then adjusts the position of the mechanism 
as a whole to bring the fingers of the takeout head into the 
correct position over the blow mould. If a new set of moulds is to be used, these steps have 
to be repeated,

<CLAIMS>
1 A method of setting up a take out mechanism in a 
glassware forming machine, 

   which machine comprises a machine frame, a set of blow 
mould members having a known invert height mounted in the 

machine frame and support means extending above the machine 
frame, the take out mechanism comprising; 

   a vertically extending housing which is secured in the 
machine frame and which comprises an upward extension 

secured to the support means 
   a piston and cylinder device in the housing 

   a stop at the lower end of the piston and cylinder 
which determines the lowermost position of the piston in 

said device 
   a rack in the housing connected to the piston and 

cylinder device 
   a takeout arm pivoted on the housing and linked to the 

rack by gear means 
   a takeout head pivoted on the takeout arm at a pivot 

point 
   takeout tongs depending from the takeout head 

   wherein a reference boss is provided on the housing, 
the method comprising 


(i) positioning a first jig member between the reference 
boss and the pivot point to ensure the takeout arm is 

at a predetermined angle to the housing; 
(ii) adjusting the stop at the lower end of the piston and 
cylinder device to ensure that when the takeout arm is 

at the predetermined angle the piston cannot move 
further downwards; 
(iii) removing the first jig member and replacing it by a 

second jig member selected according to the desired 
height of the takeout tongs above the mould members for 

 
the correct pickup of formed containers from the set of 

mould members, the second jig member depending from the 
pivot point of the arm; 
(iv) adjusting the position of the housing in the machine 
frame so that the second jig member contacts the upper 

surface of the set of blow mould members in the machine 
and fixing the housing in such position; and 
(v) adjusting a scale on the upward extension so that the 
scale reads a value equivalent to the invert height of 

the mould members. 
2 A method according to Claim 1 wherein the predetermined 
angle is 90°. 
3 A takeout mechanism for use in a method as set out in 
one of the preceding claims comprising a scale on the upward 

extension of the housing which scale is adjustable with 
respect to the bracket by which the extension is supported.
