<ABSTRACT>
A comparator system for a cache tag RAM memory that 
makes use of data bus lines already available on the cache 

tag RAM. The true data bus lines are connected together 
at a connection point and form a "wired" connection or 

configuration. A "wired" connection may be for example, 
a "wired OR", "wired NOR", "wired AND", or "wired NAND" 

according to the present invention. The complement data 
bus lines on the cache tag RAM are connected in a similar 

fashion. The comparator system is connected to the cache 
tag RAM data bus lines and generates a hit or miss signal 

based on the data on the cache tag RAM data bus lines and 
input data that controls transistors connected to the 

cache tag RAM data bus lines, resulting in a faster 
comparison function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to 
digital computer systems, and more particularly to 
cache memory systems. This application is related to European 
Patent Publication Nos EP-A-0 632 594 and EP-A-0 634 751. Cache memories are used in many computer systems to 
improve system performance. A cache memory is a 
relatively small, fast memory, which resides between a 
central processor and main system memory. Whenever the 
processor reads the contents of a memory location which is 
stored in the cache memory, the time required to access 
such location is drastically reduced. A good cache 
technique can provide a "hit ratio" of well over ninety 
percent, meaning that no main memory access is necessary 
for over ninety percent of the read operations performed. 
Access of data which is stored in the cache can improve 
access times by factors of three to ten times. A cache performs functions requiring two different 
types of memory. The first type is the data memory, in 
which the data is actually stored. The second type is 
known as a cache tag memory or cache tag RAM, which is 
used to determine which memory locations are actually 
stored in the cache. In general, the cache tag RAM 
contains a plurality of entries corresponding to the 
entries of the data cache. Each entry is indexed by some 
number of least significant bits of the address generated 
by the central processor, with the tag entry itself 
containing the most significant bits of the memory address  
 
location which is stored in the corresponding data cache entry. 
If the most significant bits stored in the cache tag match the 
most significant bits of the address currently being generated, 
with the least significant bits of this address acting as an 
index to the tag RAM, a cache "hit" has occurred and the data to 
be read may be taken from the corresponding data cache entry. 
If data corresponding to the desired address is not located in 
the data cache, the tag entry will not match the most significant 
bits of the address, and a "miss" occurs. This indicates that 
the data must be retrieved from main system memory and placed 
into the data cache. At this time, the current contents of the 
cache tag entry are overwritten with the most significant bits 
of the newly retrieved address. More information on cache memories may be found in Stone, 
High-Performance Computer Architecture, Addison-Wesley Publishing 
Co. (1987). A match detection circuit for a cache memory is also 
described in US 5218567 which applies complementary signals to
