<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus including an image pickup system and
compression processing means for compressing a photographic
image obtained from the image pickup system.Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing the
arrangement of a conventional example in which a video camera
is integrated with a digital video tape recorder for
digitally recording a video signal.In the example shown in Fig. 1, an image pickup
device 10 is provided with a complementary color filter and
performs pseudo-interlaced reading of electric charge stored
by field storage. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, the
image pickup device 10 is provided with a mosaic color filter
made up of filter elements: white (W), cyan (Cy), yellow (Ye)
and green (G). The image pickup device 10 outputs the added
values of two adjacent upper and lower lines, and a luminance
signal processing circuit 12 adds together the values of two
adjacent pixels contained in the output of the image pickup
device 10, thereby forming a luminance signal. A chrominance
signal processing circuit 14 obtains differences between the
values of the two adjacent pixels, thereby forming color-difference
signals.More specifically, a luminance signal Yn obtained
from a line #n and a luminance signal Yn+1 obtained from a 
line # (n + 1) are as follows:
Yn = (W + Cy) + (G + Ye)Yn + 1 = (W + Ye) + (G + Cy)
and the associated chrominance signals Cn and Cn + 1 are as
follows:
Cn = (W+Cy) - (G+Ye)Cn + 1 = (W+Ye) - (G+Cy)If the characteristic of each filter element W is
equal to the sum of R (red), G (green) and B (blue), i.e., R+
G+B; the characteristic of each filter element Cy is equal
to B + G; and the characteristic of each filter element Ye is
equal to Ye = R + G, the following equations are obtained:
Yn = Yn + 1 = 2R + 4G + 2BCn = 2(B - G)Cn + 1 = 2 (R - G)As shown in Fig. 2, the line numbers of adjacent
upper and lower lines to be added together are made to differ
between an even field and an odd field, whereby an interlaced
signal is obtained. To perform this addition, the image
pickup device 10 needs to be provided with a photoelectric
conversion element having lines the number of which is
equivalent to the number of lines per frame (in the NTSC 
system, 525 lines). In the case of the NTSC system, in a
line Lm of the image pickup device 10 shown in Fig. 1, m is
525.A luminance signal Y formed by the luminance signal
processing circuit 12 and a chrominance signal C formed by
the chrominance signal processing circuit 14 are stored in an
image
