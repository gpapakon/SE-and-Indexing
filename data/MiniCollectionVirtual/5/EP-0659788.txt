<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a member for regulating 
the quantity of a developer that is free from deterioration in 

the physical properties thereof even if the same is used for a 
long time, the member for regulating the quantity of a 

developer being made of a polyurethane rubber composition 
which contains an amine-type catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing unit
including a regulatory member for regulating the quantity
of developer used to develop an electrostatic latent
image formed on an image carrying member so as to form
a visible image. It also relates to copying machines and
laser beam printers including such a developing unit.
It also concerns a method of developing an electrostatic
latent image and a method of producing a printed image.A developing unit, as shown in Fig. 2, comprises an
electrophotographic photosensitive member 1; a developer
carrying member 3 (hereinafter a "developing sleeve")
attached to a developer container 2 and disposed at a
predetermined distance from the electrophotographic
photosensitive member 1; a blade 4 (hereinafter an
"elastic blade") for regulating the quantity of the
developer; an elastic roller 5; and a one-component
developer 6 (hereinafter "toner"). As a means for
reducing the thickness of a toner layer, which is carried
by the developing sleeve to the developing portion, a
structure has been known in which the elastic blade is
brought into 
contact with the developing sleeve to regulate the toner,
which is allowed to pass through between the elastic blade and
the developing sleeve, to form a thin layer of toner on the
developing sleeve; and electricity charged frictionally
(triboelectricity) for forming a latent image is supplied to
the toner in the contact portion between the elastic blade and
the developing sleeve.Since distribution of the size of toner particles ranges
from several µm (microns) to ten and several µm (microns) in the toner
layer formed on the developing sleeve, the development using
the elastic blade is required to accurately bring the elastic
blade to the top end of the surface of the developing sleeve,
to frictionally charge electricity to the toner held between
the developing sleeve and the elastic blade and to form a
uniform thin layer on the developing sleeve.As a member for regulating the quantity of the developer,
a rubber member 14 or a member 7 manufactured by integrating a
supporting member 7a made of metal foil or a plastic sheet and
a rubber member 7b has been used. As the rubber member, a
urethane rubber elastic member for regulating the quantity of
a developer has used.As the urethane rubber member, adipate urethane rubber
containing polyester polyol as the molecular skeleton thereof
has been mainly used in terms of the wear resistance, low 
plasticity deformability and frictional electricity charging
easiness.However, a hydrolyzing
