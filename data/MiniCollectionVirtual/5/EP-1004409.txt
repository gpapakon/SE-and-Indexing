<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an apparatus and control circuit for transfer of parts
between a first manufacturing operation and a second manufacturing operation.More specifically, the present invention provides a gripper jaw assembly to grasp and
separate a plurality of chain link plates from a first pressing or stamping operation for their
transfer to a second manufacturing operation. The link plates may be in a continuously
advancing line of link plates being discharged from a press operation. The gripper jaw
assembly is mounted on the distal end of a robotic apparatus with a flexible arm, which
gripper jaw is pivotable at the flexible arm end. The proximal end of the flexible arm
apparatus is secured to and pivotable about a base, which may be secured to a floor or
otherwise permanently mounted. The several assemblies or operations, that is the gripper jaw
assembly, the flexible arm, the first press and the second press, are mechanical elements
having a plurality of strategically positioned sensors, which sensors are coupled to a central
processing unit (CPU) or computer, either directly or through controllers, for control of the
operations, sensors and apparatus. The computer is operable to receive signals from any of
the sensors and controllers and to communicate control signals to the controllers and operating
elements in response to the sensed signals.Robotic apparatus for manufacturing processes are utilized in various industries and
technologies. The specific uses for such robotic apparatus include computer-controlled
automatic welding machines in the automotive industry, as well as multi-spindle drilling
apparatus for machining industries. Other known uses include assembly and grinding
operations. However, all of these applications of such flexible arm or robotic apparatus
require operating heads for the specific automated task. The flexible arm of the robotic
apparatus provides a large range of motion and a plurality of potential distal end locations in a
three-dimensional array of positions. Use of the flexible arm removes an operator from 
potentially harmful locations in proximity to moving, spinning, pressing, punching or welding
operations, and it provides a means to reduce the labor-hours per operation as an economic
benefit. Illustrations of such flexible arm apparatus are various models from ABB Flexible
Automation Inc. of New Berlin, Wisconsin noted as IRB 2400. These assemblies and
apparatus are described in a brochure, Maestro System 4 Product Line, of May 1996.The manufacture of
