<ABSTRACT>
A method and arrangement for recording imagery for subsequent or substantially simultaneous viewing, including recording partial and adjacent angles of view of imagery, from at least two spaced apart angles of view, and segmenting and separating said partial and adjacent angles of view, such that imagery so recorded, when viewed on a screen surface, has depth of imagery and appears substantially in three dimensions to the eyes of a viewer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGERYFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a method and apparatus for use in the creation of three-dimensional imagery.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONPrior to the present invention many attempts have been made to provide commercially successful and acceptable methods and apparatus for use in the creation of three-dimensional imagery. In many known methods and apparatus it is essential that some form of view differentiating intermediate opticals be used, such as for example filtered opticals, polarised opticals, shutter viewers, spectacles, lenses or lensing screens.Image depth enhancement (which is often referred to as three- dimensional imagery) can be produced in any number of known ways. In addition to the above, these include the use of dynamic lenses, dynamic mirrors, increasing comparative image size substantially; increasing image definition; using curved mirrors, lenses, fresnel screens and lenses, using frames that obscure the borders of the image; using signal changing devices that fluctuate dimensions of the image and by placing layers of transparent material (such as glass or perspex) immediately over the surface on which the image appears.Notwithstanding the fact that many attempts have been made to develop commercially acceptable methods and apparatus for use in the creation of three-dimensional imagery, there is still not a commercially accepted method and apparatus in common use. Further, the depth enhancement or three-dimensional imagery, which is able to be achieved by the methods and 

 apparatus known up until this time, is not of a standard that is acceptable for day-to-day use, such as for example in the recording and showing of slides, films, television programs, commercials and the like, whether such recordings are shown after the recording or substantially simultaneously with the recording (such as, for example, in the case of the filming of sporting events, news events and the like).It is an object of this invention to provide a straightforward and efficient method and arrangement for use in recording images for subsequent or substantially simultaneous display wherein said recorded imagery, when viewed, has depth in imagery and appears in three dimensions to the eyes of a viewer.Other objects of this invention will become apparent from the following description.DISCLOSURE OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONAccording to one aspect of this invention there is provided a method for recording imagery for subsequent or substantially simultaneous

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THIS INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. A method for recording imagery for subsequent or substantially simultaneous viewing, including recording partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery, from at least two spaced apart angles of view, and segmenting and separating said partial and adjacent angles of view, such that recorded imagery, when viewed on a screen surface, has depth of image and appears substantially in three dimensions to the eyes of a viewer.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the eyes perceive the partial, adjacent segmented and separated angles of view on said screen surface, as having depth of imagery and as being a coherent whole with depth, such as to appear to the eyes of a viewer to be in three dimensions.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1, including recording partial and adjacent angles of view from at least two spaced apart angles of view, at least one being a right-hand angle of view and at least one being a left-hand angle of view, and including segmenting and separating said partial and adjacent angles of view, such that said recorded imagery, when shown on a screen surface, is such that the eyes, when viewing said segmented and separated partial and adjacent angles of view, are unable to perceive right-hand and left-hand images, such as to form a coherent whole; the eyes of a viewer rather perceiving the segmented and separated partial and adjacent angles of view as having depth of imagery and as being a coherent whole with depth, such as to appear in three dimensions.
4. A method as claimed in claim 1, including recording partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery, from at least two angles of views spaced apart by a distance of 


 approximately 1/4 inch and approximately 3/8 inch, and segmenting and separating said partial and adjacent angles of view, such that said recorded imagery when viewed on a screen surface has depth of image and appears substantially in three dimensions to the eyes of a viewer.
5. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein any two partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery are substantially parallel one with the other.
6. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein any two spaced apart partial and adjacent angles of view are substantially parallel one with the other, and spaced apart by a distance of up to approximately 1/2 inch.
7. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery are recorded non- sequentially.
8. An arrangement for recording imagery for subsequent or substantially simultaneous display on a screen surface, including means adapted to record partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery, from at least two spaced apart angles; means being provided to segment and separate said partial and spaced apart adjacent angles of view for said display on said screen surface; the arrangement being such that said segmented and separated partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery, when appearing on said screen surface, have depth of imagery and appear to the eyes of a viewer to be in three dimensions.
9. An arrangement as claimed in claim 8, including means adapted to record said partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery, onto appropriate media. 


 10. An arrangement as claimed in claim 8, including means for recording partial and adjacent angles of view from at least two spaced apart angles of view, at least one being a right-hand angle of view and at least one being a left-hand angle of view, and including means for segmenting and separating said partial and adjacent angles of view, such that said recorded imagery, when shown on a screen surface, is such that the eyes, when viewing said segmented and separated partial and adjacent angles of view, are unable to perceive right-hand and left-hand images, such as to form a coherent whole, the eyes of a viewer rather perceiving the segmented and separated partial and adjacent angles of view as having depth of imagery and as being a coherent whole with depth, such as to appear in three dimensions to the eyes of a viewer.
11. An arrangement as claimed in claim 8, including means adapted to record partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery, from at least two spaced apart angles; wherein any two spaced apart angles are spaced apart by a distance of between approximately 1/4 inch and approximately 3/8 inch; means being provided to segment and separate said partial and adjacent angles of view for display on said screen surface; the arrangement being such that said segmented and separated adjacent angles of view of imagery, when appearing on said screen surface, have image of depth and appear to the eyes of a viewer, to be in three dimensions.
12. An arrangement as claimed in claim 8, including means adapted to record partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery for at least two spaced apart and substantially parallel angles.
13. An arrangement as claimed in claim 8, including means adapted to record partial and adjacent angles of view of said 


imagery, from at least two spaced apart and substantially parallel angles; any two spaced apart and substantially parallel angles being spaced apart by a distance of up to approximately 1/2 inch.
14. An arrangement as claimed in claim 8, including means for the non-sequential recording of said partial and adjacent angles of view of said imagery.
