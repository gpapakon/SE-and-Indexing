<ABSTRACT>
A solar cell includes a substrate 1, a compound 
semiconductor, which is a laminated film having compound 

semiconductor layers 3, 4, 5 and 6, and low melting point glass 
layers 2 and 7. When the solar cell is heated by fire, the low 

melting point glass layers melt to seal the compound 
semiconductor so that toxic substances contained in the compound 

semiconductor are not released into the air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a solar cell having low melting 
point glass and a compound semiconductor, which contains heavy 
metals such as Cd, Se and the like. A solar cell including a CdS laminated film and a 
Chalcopyrite-type compound thin film such as a CuInSe₂ film has 
been well known. Even though this solar cell is thin, its 
conversion efficiency is extremely high at about 15%. Like 
amorphous silicon-based solar cells, moreover, the properties of 
the solar cell including the laminated film are not deteriorated 
by light, and this solar cell is expected to replace crystal 
silicon-type solar cells which are currently in use. (See 
Katsumi Kushiya, Nihon Kinzoku Gakkai Kaihou (Bulletin of the 
Metallurgy Society of Japan), vol. 30,pp.930-935, 1991.) However, this solar cell with the laminated film also has 
a problem, since it contains heavy metals such as Cd, Se and the 
like, and these heavy metals are likely to be released at high 
temperature, as in a fire, thus polluting the environment. An object of the invention is to provide a solar cell 
having a compound semiconductor, which does not release heavy 
metals such as Cd and Se, when exposed to high temperatures. This and other objects and advantages of the invention 
are attained by a solar cell comprising a compound semiconductor  
 
and at least one low melting point glass layer. The compound 
semiconductor is a laminated film comprising compound 
semiconductor layers, and the low melting point glass layer is 
formed on at least one surface of the compound semiconductor. It is preferable that the low melting point glass layer 
is formed on the entire surface of the compound semiconductor. It is also preferable that the low melting point glass 
layer is formed partially on the surface of the compound 
semiconductor. It is further preferable that the low melting point glass 
layer is formed on both the top and bottom surfaces of the 
compound semiconductor. It is preferable that the low melting point glass layer 
has a softening temperature lower than 500°C. It is also preferable that the low melting point glass 
layer is 0.1-10µm thick. It is further preferable that the low melting point glass 
layer is made of at least one material selected from the group 
consisting of PbO-B₂O₃-SiO₂-Al₂O₃ glass and ZnO-B₂O₃-SiO₂ glass. It is preferable that the low melting point glass layer 
is formed by a dry deposition process. It is also preferable that the dry deposition process is 
a sputtering method. It is preferable that the low melting point
