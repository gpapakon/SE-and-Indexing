<DESCRIPTION>
This is invention relates to the treatment of
tobacco material to reduce its protein content.Investigators have found that tobacco quality is
improved by reducing its protein content. Although it is
relatively easy to remove protein from uncured tobacco
leaf, there are disadvantages to removing protein before
curing. The major problem is that protein broken down
during curing can form flavour compounds that are
important contributors to the organoleptic properties of
the smoke. Another disadvantage is that efficient
extraction of green leaf usually necessitates tobacco
structural changes which make it difficult to produce
shredded tobacco suitable for use as a cigarette filler.Partial removal of protein from cured tobacco can be
accomplished by extraction with water, with the
efficiency of the extraction improving as the particle
size is reduced. However, for shredded tobacco of the
size normally used for cigarette manufacture, most of the
protein cannot be extracted by water alone.United States Patent no. 4,407,307 describes the
removal of protein from tobacco strips in an aqueous
solution of a proteolytic enzyme whereby insoluble
proteins are decomposed into soluble fragments. The
extract is separated from the tobacco and inoculated with
a yeast culture, which, as it grows, removes the soluble
protein fragments in the extract by metabolic
assimilation. After removal of the yeast, the protein-free
extract is concentrated and added back to the
tobacco strips.United States Patent no. 4,887,618 describes a
process in which tobacco is first extracted with water. 
The tobacco residue remaining after extraction is
separated from the solution, mixed with water and treated
with a proteolytic enzyme. The protein-reduced tobacco
is separated from the enzyme solution, rinsed and dried.
The water extract is concentrated and added back to the
protein reduced tobacco whereby water soluble flavour
tobacco components and the nicotine is retained in the
final product.The processes of the above described United States
Patents rely on protease enzymes alone to remove protein
from tobacco material. Our own investigations have found
that enzymes which efficiently remove protein from
tobacco are expensive, while those enzymes which are
available in commercial quantities at a reasonable price,
are much less efficient for protein removal. United
States Patent no. 4,716,911 also recognizes this
disadvantage and proposes using either an alkali or a
combination of a protease and a non-protease depolymerase
to effect protein

<CLAIMS>
A method for reducing the protein content of cured
tobacco, which includes the steps of:


(a) applying a 0.01-5% weight per volume solution of
an anionic surfactant to the tobacco material;
(b) separating the solution from the tobacco
material;
(c) removing the surfactant and polypeptides from
the solution; and
(d) combining the tobacco material from step (b)
with the solution from step (c),

   wherein the anionic surfactant is a sodium
alkylsulfonate or a sodium alkylarylsulfonate.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the solution
from step (c) is concentrated prior to step (d).
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the solution
from step (c) is concentrated by reverse osmosis to 20 -

35% solubles by weight and the solution is sprayed onto
the tobacco material in step (d).
A method according to any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein
the tobacco material is extracted with an aqueous solvent

before extracting with the surfactant.
A method according to Claim 4, which additionally
includes the step of: 


(e) combining the tobacco material from step (b)
with the aqueous extract obtained from the initial

extraction with aqueous solvent.
A method according to Claim 5, wherein the aqueous
extract is concentrated prior to step (e).
A method according to Claim 6, wherein the aqueous
extract is concentrated by reverse osmosis to 20 to 25%

solubles by weight and the extract is sprayed onto the
tobacco material in step (e).
A method according to any of Claims 1 to 7, wherein,
in step (c) the polypeptides are removed by treating the

solution with an insoluble adsorbent, which method also
comprises the following steps:


(f) concentrating the solution from step (c)
(g) drying the tobacco material from step (b) to
about 12-15% moisture by weight; and
(h) spraying the solution from step (f) onto the
dried tobacco material from step (g).
A method according to Claim 8, wherein the insoluble
adsorbent is bentonite, hydroxyapatite or attapulgite.
A method according to Claim 9, wherein the insoluble
adsorbent is bentonite.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
the tobacco material is also treated with a proteolytic

enzyme. 
A method according to Claim 11, wherein the enzyme
is obtained from a fungal or bacterial source.
A method according to Claim 12, wherein 0.1-5%
weight of the enzyme is used relative to the weight of

tobacco material solution.
A method according to any preceding Claim, wherein
the surfactant is sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.
