<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing package assembly (2) useful for dispensing a predetermined amount of a fluent material comprises a relatively stiff base sheet (4), a blister overlay (6) appended to the base sheet and a dispenser pouch (8) housed within the confines of the overlay and the sheet. The blister overlay having a main cavity (10) and a secondary cavity (12) includes a dispenser depression (16), preferably in the shape of a thumb indentation, which protrudes downwardly into the main cavity. A shearing depression (18) extending laterally through the secondary cavity defines an area of reduced depth within the secondary cavity. The main body (20) of the pouch is located within the overlay main cavity having a dispensing channel (22) or a passageway extending therefrom beneath the shearing depression and into the secondary cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a dispensing 
package assembly, and more particularly, relates to an 
improved package for safely containing and dispensing a pre-determined 
amount of fluent material. A variety of packaging systems have heretofore been 
developed in the art for dispensing a pre-determined dosage 
amount of a fluent material onto a substrate. Particularly 
when dispensing single doses of a pharmaceutical, biological 
or pesticidal formulation, the full dosage amount need be 
delivered with accuracy while preventing contact between the 
material being applied and the user/applicator. Glass ampoules including a dropper system have been used 
extensively in the past to dispense a measured amount of a 
fluent composition onto a patient or other substrate, but 
these ampoules are relatively inconvenient to transport, 
store and use in addition to posing the risk of breakage at 
any time during distribution and use. Plastic packets have also been developed for dispensing a 
pre-determined amount of fluent material. Although these 
packets are relatively more convenient and safe than the 
glass ampoules heretofore mentioned, the user/applicator is  
 
generally required to handle the packet extensively, often 
times manually squeezing the packet to completely the expel 
material. There is a substantial risk that the user will 
come into contact with the contained material by handling 
the packet in this manner. In addition, the flexible 
packets are not well suited for directing the contained 
material to a desired point of application or to spreading 
the material upon being applied. Another problem encountered with single dose packages 
heretofore developed in the art is that the packages are too 
small to have all the necessary product information, 
instructions and warnings printed thereon. Government 
regulations, however, frequently require that this 
information be presented on the package itself and it is 
desirable to include such information so that it is 
immediately available to the user/applicator during the 
application process. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a 
dispensing package assembly for safely and conveniently 
storing and dispensing a pre-determined amount of a fluent 
material. It is another object of the present invention to provide a 
dispensing package assembly wherein product information and 
labeling is provided on the package assembly. It is a further object of the present invention to provide 
a dispensing package assembly that
