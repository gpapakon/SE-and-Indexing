<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for calibration of a mobile object in a determined space by means of a video camera (20) or similar mounted on the mobile object (14), the camera (20) being positionable to sight targets (22) placed around the mobile object (14), thereby enabling the position and orientation of the object to be determined precisely by triangulation. In particular, the position and orientation of a sensor or a tool mounted on a robot can be determined precisely in this way.

A method of identifying the position in three dimensions of a
movable object, e.g. such as a sensor or a tool carried by a robot,

the method consisting in mounting a photosensitive detector,
e.g. such as a video camera (20), on the movable object (14), and in

using the detector to sight targets (22) disposed at predetermined
locations relative to the displacement zone of the movable object

(14), the method being characterized in that it also consists in
mounting the detector (20) so as to be capable of being swivelled

about at least one axis on the movable object, in sighting the
targets (22) by pivoting the detector about said axis and without

displacing the movable object (14) so as to obtain output signals
from the detector that correspond to images of the sighted targets,

in determining from said signals the positions of the optical axis
(34) of the detector that correspond to the various sighted targets,

and in deducing therefrom the accurate position and orientation of
said movable object by triangulation.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists
in accurately determining the positions of the points of intersection

of the optical axis (34) of the detector and the surfaces of the
sighted targets (22), in also determining the corresponding angular

positions of the detector relative to the movable object (14), and in
deducing therefrom the corresponding positions in three dimensions of

the optical axis of the detector.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it
consists in taking account of parameters specific to the means (32)

for swivelling the detector (20) to determine the position in three
dimensions of its optical axis.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
for a detector (20) that is rotatable stepwise to occupy angular

positions that are defined with a high degree of repeatability, the
method includes a prior calibration operation during which the

relative positions of the optical axis (34) of the detector are
accurately determined for all possible angular positions. 
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
it includes a prior calibration operation during which the parameters

specific to the means (32) for swivelling the detector (20) are
determined accurately.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
it includes a prior calibration operation during which the positions

and orientations of the targets (22) are accurately determined by
sighting each of the targets at least three times with the detector

(20) for different known positions of the movable object (14).
Apparatus for identifying the position in three dimensions of a
movable object, e.g. such as a sensor or a tool carried by a robot,

the apparatus comprising a photosensitive detector e.g. such as a
video camera (20), carried by the movable object (14), targets (22)

disposed in predetermined locations relative to the displacement zone
of the movable object (14), and data processing means (36) connected

to the above-specified detector (20) to receive signals corresponding
to said targets (22) sighted by the detector, the apparatus being

characterized in that the photosensitive detector is swivel-mounted
so as to be capable of being swivelled about at least one axis on the

movable object (14), and in that the apparatus also comprises means
for turning the detector about said axis thereby sighting different

targets (22) without displacing the movable object (14), the data
processing means (36) also receive signals corresponding to the

angular orientations of the detector about its axis corresponding to
the sighted targets so as to deduce therefrom the positions of the

optical axis of the detector corresponding to the sighted targets and
to determine the accurate position and orientation of said movable

object (14) by triangulation.
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that the detector
(20) is displaceable in rotation about two perpendicular axes.
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that the
detector (20) is displaceable in stepwise rotation to occupy 

predetermined angular positions about the, or each, above-mentioned
axis, said angular positions being defined with a high degree of

repeatability.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7 to 9, characterized in
that the targets (22) are located outside the displacement zone of

the movable object (14).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7 to 10, characterized
in that the targets (22) comprise panels (24) carrying series of

reference marks (30) formed at predetermined intervals relative to
one another.
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that each
target (22) includes two types of reference mark (30).
Apparatus according to claim 11 or 12, characterized in that the
reference marks are balls or spheres (30) made of materials having

determined capacities for reflecting or diffusing light.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7 to 13, characterized
in that the targets (22) are mounted in fixed manner on rigid

supports (26, 28) that include means for absorbing vibration.
