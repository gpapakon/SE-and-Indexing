<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for removing receptacles from transport containers, especially bottles from boxes or cartons, each transport container passing at least two or more groups of gripping elements, and at least one group grasping only receptacles having specific features and extracting them from the transport containers, the various groups of gripping elements being held by a common crossmember which, by means of a suspension, can be positively controlled from a receptacle extraction station to a receptacle delivery station and back.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for removing receptacles (1) from transport containers (2), particularly 
bottles from boxes or cartons, wherein each transport container passes at least two or 

more groups (A, B) of gripping elements (3a, 3b) and at least one group (A) only 
detects and removes from the transport containers receptacles (1a) with defined 

features, characterised in that the different groups (A, B) of gripping elements (3) are 
held by a common crosshead (4), which can be forcibly steered, by means of a 

suspension (5, 5'), from a receptacle removal station (Ia, Ib) to a receptacle discharge 
station (IIa, IIb) and back. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the transport containers (2) 
can be guided, by a transport container conveyor (6) which can be driven in cycles, 

past the groups (A, B) of gripping elements (3a, 3b) disposed in series in the 
conveying direction (F) in such a way that a transport container can be acted upon 

each time by the different groups (A, B) of gripping elements (3a, 3b). 
An apparatus according to either one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
crosshead (4) can be moved in a forcibly steered manner, transverse to the conveying 

direction (F) of the transport container conveyor (6), from the receptacle removal 
station (Ia, Ib) to the receptacle discharge station (IIa, IIb) and back on a hook-shaped 

path (8), and the receptacle discharge station (IIa, IIb) has receptacle discharge 
conveyors (7a, 7b) which can be driven in cycles and which are associated with the 

groups (A, B) of gripping elements (3a, 3b), the conveying direction (Ga, Gb) of 
which discharge conveyors preferably runs parallel to that of the transport container 

conveyor (6). 
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that at least one receptacle 
discharge conveyor (7b) can be driven in the conveying direction (F) of the transport  

 
container conveyor (6) and at least one further receptacle discharge conveyor (7a) can 

be driven in the opposite direction (Ga). 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the crosshead (4) circulates forcibly guided on a closed path (9) with a constant 

direction of circulation. 
An apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the crosshead (4) can be 
moved, transverse to the conveying direction (F) of the transport container conveyor 

(6), from the receptacle removal station (Ia, Ib) to the receptacle discharge station 
(IIa, IIb) and back, wherein receptacle discharge conveyors, which can be 

continuously driven transverse to the conveying direction (F) of the receptacle 
conveyor (6), are associated with the receptacle discharge station. 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
in the region of the receptacle removal station (Ia, Ib) the groups (A, B) of gripping 

elements (3a, 3b) are disposed side by side on the crosshead (4) transverse to the 
conveying direction (F) of the transport container conveyor (6). 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the transport container conveyor (6) continuously conveys the transport containers (2) 

past the receptacle removal station (Ia, Ib). 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the transport container conveyor (6) feeds the transport containers (2) in succession 

to the different groups (A, B) of gripping elements (3a, 3b), in that the transport 
container conveyor (6) comprises a number of conveyor loops (40) which depends on 

the number of groups (A, B) present, wherein each loop starts from the output of the 
unpacking machine and leads back to its input. 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims 7 to 9, characterised 
in that in the region of the receptacle discharge station (IIa, IIb) the receptacle  

 
discharge conveyors (7a, 7b) run in parallel alignment with the transport container 

conveyor (6) and can be driven in the same direction as the latter. 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims 7 to 10, characterised 
in that the conveying plane of the receptacle discharge conveyor runs above the 

conveying plane of the transport containers, and in particular the receptacle discharge 
conveyors are disposed in alignment above the transport container conveyor. 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
a plurality of crossheads (4) is disposed displaced in the direction of circulation on 

a continuously circulating carrier (11). 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the circulating path (8, 9) of a crosshead (4) lies in a vertical plane. 
An apparatus according to according to at least one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the transport container conveyor (6) comprises a plurality of 

conveyor tracks running in parallel for the simultaneous feeding of a plurality of rows 
of transport containers.
