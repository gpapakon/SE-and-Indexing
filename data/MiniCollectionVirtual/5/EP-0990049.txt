DETECTION AND CONFIRMATION OF NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCES BY USE OF OLIGONUCLEOΗDES COMPRISING A SUBSEQUENCE HYBRIDIZING EXACTLY TO A KNOWN TERMINAL SEQUENCE AND A SUBSEQUENCE HYBRIDIZING TO AN UNDENTIFIED SEQUENCERELATED APPLICATIONS AND GRANT SUPPORT This application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application SerialNo. 60/054,887 originally filed on August 7, 1997, which is entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING, QUANTIFYING, AND CONFIRMING DNA SEQUENCES IN A SAMPLE WITHOUT SEQUENCING" and is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. The invention disclosed herein was made utilizing United States Government support under Grant Number 7ONANB5H1O36 awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Accordingly, the United States Government has certain rights in the invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe field of the invention is DNA sequence classification, identification or determination, and quantification; more particularly it is the quantitative classification, comparison of expression, or identification of preferably all DNA sequences or genes in a sample without performing any associated sequencing.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAs molecular biological and genetics research have advanced, it has become increasingly clear that the temporal and spatial expression of genes plays a vital role in processes occurring in both health and in disease. Moreover, the field of biology has progressed from an understanding of how single genetic defects cause the traditionally recognized hereditary disorders (e.g., the thalassemias), to a realization of the importance of the interaction of multiple genetic defects in concert with various environmental factors in the etiology of the majority of the more complex disorders, such as neoplasia. For example, in the case of neoplasia, recent experimental evidence has demonstrated the key causative roles of multiple defects in several pivotal genes causing their altered expression. Other complex diseases have been shown to have a similar etiology. Therefore, the more complete and reliable a correlation which can be established between gene expression and 

disease states, the better diseases will be able to be recognized, diagnosed and treated. This important correlation may be established by the quantitative determination and classification of DNA expression in tissue samples.Genomic DNA ("gDNA") sequences are those naturally occurring DNA sequences constituting the genome of a cell.
