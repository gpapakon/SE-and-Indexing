<ABSTRACT>
The chair has a seat part (1) and a back part (2) which possess a seat and back area formed in each case by a wire grid, the wires of which are fastened by their ends (18, 26, 27), at least in some cases, to respective frames. To enable the chair to be manufactured simply and cost-effectively in such a way that damage to the clothing of the person sitting on the chair is prevented. The wire ends (18, 26, 27) are fastened to the mutually facing inner sides of frame parts (11, 6) of the frames.

A chair comprising a seat (1) and a back (2) having a seating
surface (23) and a back surface (16) each formed by a wire mesh,

the wires (15, 17, 24, 25) of which are fixed at least in part to a
respective frame (3, 8) by their ends (18, 21, 26, 27), characterised

in that the wire ends (18, 21, 26, 27) are fixed to the facing inner
surfaces of frame parts (9 to 11, 4 to 6) of the frames (8, 3).
A chair according to claim 1, characterised in that the wire ends
(18, 21, 26, 27) are bent substantially at right angles.
A chair according to claim 2, characterised in that the wire ends
(18, 21) of the wires (15, 17) of the back (2) are bent rearwards.
A chair according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the wire
ends (26, 27) of the wires (24, 25) of the seat (1) are bent

downwards.
A chair according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in
that the bent wire ends (18, 21, 26, 27) extend substantially over

half the thickness of the frame parts (9 to 11, 4 to 6).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that a transverse strut (28) extends between lateral frame parts (4, 

5) of the seat (1) and delimits the seating surface (23) from the
back (2), and in that the ends (30) of the wires (27 [sic - 25]
) of the
seating surface (23) - remote from the front frame part (6) of the

frame (3) of the seat (1) - are preferably fixed to the transverse
strut (28).
A chair according to claim 6, characterised in that, on its side
remote from the seating surface (23), the transverse strut (28) has a

recess (29), into which the wire ends (30) project, and in that the
depth of the recess (29) preferably corresponds to the thickness of

the wire ends (30).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that a transverse strut (12) extends between lateral frame parts (9,

10) of the back (2) and delimits the back surface (16) from the seat
(1), the ends of the wires (15) of the back surface (16) - remote

from the upper frame part (11) of the frame (8) of the back (2) -
preferably being fixed to the transverse strut (12).
A chair according to claim 8, characterised in that, on its side
remote from the back surface (16), the transverse strut (12) has a

recess (13), into which the wire ends project, the depth of the
recess (13) preferably corresponding to the thickness of the wire

ends.
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in
that the upper frame part (11) of the frame (8) of the back (2) and

the front frame part (6) of the frame (3) of the seat (1) are curved 
differently, and in that the frames (3, 8) of the seat (1) and the

back (2) are preferably formed integrally with one another.
A chair according to claim 10, characterised in that the upper
frame part (11) of the frame (8) of the back (2) has a smaller radius

of curvature than the front frame part (6) of the frame (3) of the
seat (1).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in
that the transverse strut (28) of the seat (1) extends parallel to the

front frame part (6).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in
that the transverse strut (12) of the back (2) extends parallel to the

upper frame part (11).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in
that the seating surface (23) has the same radius of curvature as

the front frame part (6).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 14, characterised in
that the back surface (16) has the same radius of curvature as the

upper frame part (11).
