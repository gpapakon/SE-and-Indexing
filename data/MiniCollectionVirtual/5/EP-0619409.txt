<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-bolt lock with handle actuation comprises, in a lock case (1), a latch (12), a bolt (33) and, in each case, a connecting slide (7, 30) for two push rods (8, 31). A split follower or two followers (2, 3) with offset axes of rotation actuate the push rods (8, 31) via a lever mechanism (lever 4) on the one hand and via a toothed gear (29, 18, 19, 20, 21) on the other hand. A multiple-bolt lock, irrespective of the type of push-rod actuation, can have a blocking plate (40) which is actuable by means of a lock cylinder and which can be pushed by means of a blocking nose (42) into a recess (43) of the push rod (8, 31) or of a connecting slide (7, 30) in the lock case (1) in order to block the locking. For the emergency opening of a blocked multiple-block lock, a slide (44) can be connected to the inner handle follower (2), which runs with a control edge (47) up against the blocking plate (40) and pulls the latter back into the release position. In order to prevent a self-locking position of the cylinder boss (38) relative to the control edge (41) of the blocking plate (40), there is provided a spring plate (52) which presses the cylinder boss (38) away out of the region of the control edge (41).

<CLAIMS>
Multi-bolt lock with catch, bolt, at least one push rod 
with connecting slide and with an inner and an outer latch 

which are held in form-locking relationship in an axially 
split nut or in separate nuts offset from each other and can 

be pivoted up for locking out of a neutral, in particular 
horizontal central position and pushed down for opening out 

of the central position, characterised in that the nut (2) 
of the inner latch is kinematically connected by a lever 

mechanism (4) to at least one push rod (8, 31) or the 
connecting slides (7, 30) thereof and the nut (2) of the 

Inner latch preferably comprises a lever (4) which is 
connected to the nut (2) and the free end of which is 

pivotable towards driver stops (5, 6) on one of the push 
rods (8, 31) or on the connecting slides (7, 30) thereof, in 

that the nut (3) of the outer latch is located on the 
driving side of a gear mechanism the gears (29; 18, 19, 20, 

21) of which mesh with toothed regions of both push rods (8, 
31) or connecting slides (7, 30) thereof and in that between 

the nut (2) of the inner latch as well as of the outer latch 
and the push rods (8, 31) or the connecting slides (7, 30) 

is provided a free passage for idle return of the inner as 
well as the outer latch to the central position. 
Multi-bolt lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the driver stops (5, 6) of the push rod (8, 31) or the 

connecting slide (7, 30) thereof are spaced apart from each 
other and the free end of the lever (4) is located between 

the driver stops (5, 6) and in that the nut (3) of the outer 
latch carries a radial driver (25) which engages between 

stops (26, 27) of a gear or gear segment (29) of the gear 
mechanism, wherein the distance between the driver stops (5, 

6) of the push rod (8) or the connecting slide (7) as well 

as between the stops (26, 27) of the gear or gear segment 
(29) corresponds to at least the angle of rotation of the 

latches out of the central position into the locking  
 

position or out of the central position into the open 
position. 
Multi-bolt lock with catch, bolt, a lock cylinder, at 
least one push rod with stop slide and an inner and an outer 

latch which are held in form-locking relationship in an 
axially split nut or in separate nuts offset from each other 

and can be pivoted up for locking out of a neutral, in 
particular horizontal central position and pushed down for 

opening out of the central position, characterised in that 
the bolt (33) can be pushed in and out by a pin and slot 

control system with a slot (35) arranged obliquely to the 
direction of advance of the bolt, in particular in the bolt 

shaft (34) and the pin (36) on one of the push rods (8, 31) 
or the connecting slide (7, 30) thereof on operation of the 

push rods (8, 31) and in that with the lock cylinder (37) a 
locking projections (42) of a locking plate (40) for fixing 

the push rods (8, 31) or the connecting slides (7, 30) 
thereof in position and blocking latch operation can be 

pushed into a recess (43) or over a projection of one of the 
push rods (8, 31) or the connecting slides (7, 30) thereof. 

(Fig. 3a) 
Multi-bolt lock according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the locking plate (40) comprises driver stops, in 

particular a lateral recess (39) with control edges (41), 
for engagement of the cylinder cam (38) of the lock cylinder 

(37) on locking or release by the lock cylinder (37) and in 
that there is provided a pretensioned spring movable towards 

the lock cylinder (37) or a spring plate (52) the end face 
of which passes through the circle of rotation of the 

cylinder cam (38) in a chord-like manner in the region of 
the control edge (41) and turns the cylinder cam (38) with 

spring force out of the region of the control edges (41) of 
the recess perhaps in case of inadequate key rotation (Fig. 

3b).  
 
Multi-bolt lock according to claim 3, characterised in 
that for emergency opening or panic release by means of the 

inner latch the nut (2) thereof controls a linear slide 
(44), for example by means of a radial finger (46), which 

engages in a lateral recess or tooth gap (45) of the slide 
(44) and wherein the slide (44) at the front side comprises 

an oblique control face (47) which when the bolt (33) is 
locked can be pushed towards a stop or a driver face (48) of 

the locking plate (40) for retraction of the locking 
projection (42) out of the recess (43) or from the 

projection of the push rod (8, 31) or the connecting slide 
(7, 30) thereof. 
Multi-bolt lock according to claim 5, characterised in 
that between the free end of the lever (4) of the lever 

mechanism of the nut (2) of the inner latch in the position 
of the latch central position and the driver stop (6) for 

release on the push rod (8) or on the connecting slide (7) 
thereof in the locking position of the push rod (8) there is 

provided a distance which corresponds to at least the angle 
of rotation of the lever (4) by which the locking projection 

(42) of the locking plate (40) is retracted by the depth of 
engagement in the recess (43) or the amount of overlap of 

the projection of the push rod (8) or the connecting slide 
(7) thereof. (Fig. 3a) 
Multi-bolt lock according to any of claims 1 to 6,
