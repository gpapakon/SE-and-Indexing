<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to hygienic and especially medico-surgical accessories and, in particular, to latex or polyethylene articles for medical or hygienic use such as gloves, finger-stalls or condoms. These articles are characterized in that they are impregnated or coated or include a layer containing at least one flavine derivative selected from the group consisting of riboflavine, flavine adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) in association with vitamin PP and/or vitamin E and/or vitamin A and/or vitamin C and/or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in association with or in a mixture with inert diluants and glidants. Application in combatting viral infections.

<CLAIMS>
Hygiene articles made of latex or polyvinyle chloride wherein into the mass of the polymeric
material, they are incorporated riboflavin or a salt thereof and adenine dinucleotide flavine (ADF)

in an amount effective for acting as an optoelectronic and biochemical "screen".
Hygiene articles according to claim 1 which are medico-surgical gloves.
Hygiene articles according to claim 1 which are medical fingerstalls.
Hygiene articles according to claim 1 wherein it is condoms.
A process for manufacturing hygiene articles according to claim 1 which consists in mixing
riboflavin or a salt thereof and ADF with one of the preparation baths of latex in a slightly acid

medium, in order to introduce riboflavin and ADF into the polymer mass wherein an adjuvant is
optionally added without damaging the biochemical structure of the colouring matters, in making

hygiene articles hot-molding, next in performing a vulcanizing step then after cooling a rinsing
with water and drying.
A process for manufacturing hygiene articles according to claim 1 wherein for preparing condoms
in latex with two layers between two layers of latex before casting out a solution of riboflavin or a

salt thereof, of ADF or eventually of ascorbic acid.
A process for manufacturing hygiene articles according to claim 1 wherein it is added to condoms
prepared according to the process of claims 5 or 6, a cream or an orange-yellow lubricating gel

containing riboflavin or a salt thereof, and ADF with which the internal wall is covered.
The process according to claim 7 wherein that cream or lubricating gel further contains, vitamin E
and/or vitamin A and/or folic acid and/or ascorbic acid and/or vitamin PP and/or NADP.
The process according to one of claims 5 to 8 applied to articles of gauze or cotton such as masks,
caps, coats, sheets or undersheets.
