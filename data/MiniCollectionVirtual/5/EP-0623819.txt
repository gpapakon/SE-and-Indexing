<ABSTRACT>
System for analyzing the concentration of a number of different 
ions in a watery solution, using a capillary zone electrophoresis 

apparatus comprising a capillary tube extending between an input 
opening and a detection area and filled with an electrolyte, an 

input device for injecting a sample of the solution to be analyzed 
in the input opening of the capillary tube, a voltage source for 

establishing a voltage gradient along the capillary tube between 
the input opening and the detection area to evoke a migration of 

the ions in said sample through the capillary tube, and a detector 
circuit for detecting the ions passing through the capillary tube 

by measuring the conductivity of the passing fluid. The system 
comprises furthermore a processor for calculating the ion concentrations, 

said processor receiving data from said detector circuit 
and from a further conductivity sensor providing to said processor 

data representing the total conductivity of the solution from which 
the sample was taken. By comparing the data from both detectors the 

calculated ion concentrations can be calibrated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for analysing the concentration
of a number of different ions in a watery solution, using a
capillary zone electrophoresis apparatus comprising
at least one capillary tube extending between an input opening
and a detection area and filled with an electrolyte,a voltage source for establishing a voltage gradient along
the capillary tube between the input opening and the detection area
to evoke a migration of the ions in said sample through the capillary
tube, anda detector circuit for detecting the ions passing through the
capillary tube by measuring the conductivity of the passing fluid,a processor receiving data from said detector circuit representing
momentary peak levels in the measured conductivity as well
as moments in time at which the respective peaks appear,said processor being programmed to determine for each detected
peak in the measured conductivity level the kind of ion and the
concentration of the respective ion based on the data received from
said detector circuit.Systems of this kind are known from various prior art publications.
Typical examples are described in the European patent
application EP-0,295,942 and the US Patent US-3,932,264.During operation a sample of the solution to be analyzed is
injected by the input device into the input opening of the capillary
tube. In the following migration process the voltage source is
switched on to start the migration in the capillary tube in the
course of which each ion will start to move according to its own
mobility through the capillary tube. Because of the mobility differences
the ions in the electrolyte will be separated into zones
such that ions of different type will pass the detector at different
times which are characteristic for the type of ions. The
strength of the signal generated by the detector circuit as a zone
of ions passes the detector is related to the concentration of the
respective type of ions.A problem in said prior art systems is the calibration of the
system. If the length of the capillary tube between the input opening 
and the detector area is selected long enough, establishing a
relatively long migration period, the separation between the various
kinds of ions will be distinct enough to enable the identification
of each ion type on the basis of the elapsed time period
between the moment of sample injection and the moment the respective
ions pass the detector area. Especially if the number of different
types of ions is rather restricted the influence of variable
parameters such as the
