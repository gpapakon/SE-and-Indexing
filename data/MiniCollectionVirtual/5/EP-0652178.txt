<ABSTRACT>
A signatures finishing system (10) for on-line center folding of sets of signature 
sheets (18) outputted by a reproduction system (11); by sequentially individually fully folding 

the signature sheets (18) in a folding rollers (26,27) nip as they are outputted and reversing the 
nip at a position in which the opposite ends of the sheet (18) engage the opposite sides of a 

closely adjacent saddle compiler (30) to sequentially stack the folded signature sheets (18) on 
the saddle compiler (30) to form plural sheet compiled pre-folded signature sheet booklets, 

and then, after stapling (40), ejecting the compiled folded signatures booklet from the saddle 
compiler (30) through the same folding rollers (26,27) nip to a booklet output system which 

may perform edge trimming (48) and stacking (50) of the booklets ejected through the folding 
rollers (26,27) nip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to "on-line finishing" of folded booklets, and more 
particularly to a simplified signatures finishing system providing center-folded 
and fastened 
booklets of signature collated pages outputted by an electronic printer, or other reproduction 
apparatus. By way of background, it is desirable, especially as copiers and printers increase in 
speed and capabilities, for their paper handling and output to be more automated and made 
more reliable in general. "On-line finishing" is one means for such improvements. It may be 
roughly defined as a system in which the document pages being copied are printed in a order 
such that each copy set or job set comes out precollated, and thus can be automatically finished 
[stapled, glued or otherwise bound] in collated sets without manual handling or post-collation, 
starting immediately with the first set, and while subsequent copy sets of that same job are 
being printed by that reproduction apparatus. Preferably the finisher is integral, or a separable 
module at the output of, the reproduction apparatus for directly sequentially receiving the 
individual sheets as soon as they are printed. "Signature" printing is an old and well known term in the art of book printing. 
Conventionally, a signature is a sheet printed and intended to be center folded and center 
fastened in pamphlet or book binders. A collated set of plural stacked signature sheets which 
are center folded and center fastened may provide an individual booklet, with pages which 
can be turned in a normal manner. That can also be called a single "quire", although the term 
"quire" is more commonly used where each "quire" is differently paginated and intended to 
be fastened together in traditional bookbinding with the other quires to form a traditional 
book. The term "booklet" is used broadly and generally herein. Signature sheets are normally 
duplex (both sides) printed with 4 pages total in signature pairs page order. Often they are U.S. 
27.9 x 43.2 cm (11"x17"), or European or Japanese equivalent, large copy sheets which, when 
center folded, form booklets of standard letter or office size. The requisite center spline 
stapling, stitching or gluing of collated sets of such signatures is preferably done in automatic 
signature [book] binders. Another term used for signature finishers is a "Signature booklet 
maker" or SBM. These may, or may not, collate the sets of signatures on what is called a 
"saddle stitcher" or "roof stitcher". Signature binders are optional

<CLAIMS>
A system for on-line center folding of sets of signature sheets (18) outputted by a 
reproduction system using a saddle compiler with two opposite sides forming an inverted "V" 

comprising an input sheet feeding system (14, 15, 16, 20, 22) for feeding the central area of each outputted 
signature sheet into a folding rollers nip for sequentially individually fully folding said 

signature sheets in said folding rollers nip as they are outputted by said reproduction system;  
 

characterised by comprising: 

said pair of folding roller (26, 27) being reversible and closely adjacent 
to said saddle compiler (30) and 

forming said folding rollers nip; 
a reversible drive for said folding rollers which is automatically reversed at a position 
which will sequentially stack each so folded signature sheet on said adjacent saddle compiler to 

form plural sheet compiled pre-folded signature sheet booklets; and 
a set ejector (43) for ejecting said compiled folded signatures booklet from said saddle 
compiler fully through said same folding rollers nip to a booklet output system, while said 

reversible drive for said folding rollers is re-reversed. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said sheets are so reversed after being center folded 
in said folding rollers nip by said reversible drive at a position in which the opposite ends of the 

sheet engage said opposite side of the saddle compiler to provide positive control of the folded 
sheet ends and to prevent closure of the folded sheet ends before said compiling. 
The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein said folding rollers nip is substantially expandable 
for feeding said compiled booklets therethrough versus said folding of individual signature 

sheets therein. 
The system of claim 1, 2 or 3, further including a stapling system for stapling said 
compiled booklet while it is on said saddle compiler. 
The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein said booklet output system 
includes a booklet edge trimmer and booklet stacker for edge trimming and stacking the 

booklets ejected through said folding rollers nip. 
The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the central area of each signature 
sheet is buckled into said finishing rollers nip by said input sheet feeding system, and said 

folding rollers nip feeds an individual signature sheet partially centrally therethrough to center 

fold it, and then said nip reverses substantially before the ends of the signature sheet are in  
 

said nip to respectively feed the ends of the signature sheet out to said opposite sides of said 
saddle compiler. 
A method of on-line center folding of sets of signature sheets (18) outputted by a 
reproduction system having the step of sequentially individually 

fully folding said signature sheets (18) in a folding rollers 
nip as they are outputted by said reproduction system; 

characterised by comprising the steps of: 

reversing said folding rollers nip with a signature sheet therein and sequentially 
stacking said so folded signature sheets on a closely adjacent saddle compiler (30); 
repeating said steps to form plural sheet compiled pre-folded signature sheet 
booklets in said saddle compiler; and 
ejecting said compiled folded signatures booklet from said saddle compiler fully 
through said same folding rollers nip to a booklet output system by re-reversing 

and further 
opening said folding rollers nip. 
The method of claim 7, including the step of reversing the sheets after they have 
been center folded in said folding rollers nip at a position in which the opposite ends of the 

sheet engage the opposite sides of the saddle compiler to provide positive control of the folded 
sheet ends and to prevent closure of the folded sheet ends before compiling. 
The method of claim 7 or 8, including the step of opening said folding rollers nip 
substantially further for feeding said compiled booklets therethrough versus said folding of 

individual signature sheets therein. 
The method of claim 7, 8 or 9, further including the step of center 
stapling said compiled booklet while it is on said saddle compiler.
