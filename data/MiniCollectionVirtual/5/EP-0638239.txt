<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine for the industrial-scale manufacture of edible trays (boats) intended to contain foodstuffs, the said machine cutting up individual pieces of dough in a rolling-out device which may or may not be floured, and placing the said pieces onto a shaping pattern and transferring to a baking oven.   The machine according to the invention comprises a conveyor belt (5, 7), a transfer belt (4) carrying contiguous shaping moulds, the said transfer belt (4) connecting to the downstream end of the conveyor belt (5), a cutting roller (9) carrying several series of hollow axial recesses, a pressing roller (10) carrying at least one axial series of hollow recesses of a shape which complements that of the said shaping moulds, and means for separating and recovering the dough between the reliefs. Application to the manufacture of edible trays.

A machine for industrial manufacture of edible boats for holding foodstuffs, the said machine
cutting out individual pieces of rolled-out pastry, which may be dredged, and placing the said

pieces on a moulding relief and transferring them to an oven, characterized in that it comprises a
feed conveyor (5, 7) for rolled-out pastry with a thickness controlled by a thicknessing roll, a

transfer conveyor (4) carrying contiguous moulds (2), each provided with a plurality of
transversely aligned reliefs (24) corresponding to the shape of the cavity of the boat, the said

transfer conveyor (4) adjoining the downstream end of the feed conveyor (5), a cutting-out roller
(9) carrying several axial rows of hollow mould shapes (16) with cutting edges corresponding to

the shape of the pieces to be cut out of the rolled-out pastry, the said cutting-out roller (9) being
disposed in such a manner as to come into contact with the rolled-out pastry as it moves, a

pressure roller (10) carrying at least one axial row of hollow mould shapes (23) of shape
complementary to that of the reliefs (24) of the said moulds (2), the said pressure roller (10)

being disposed in such a manner as to mould the rolled-out pastry positioned on the moulds (2) to
the shape of the said reliefs (24), and means for separating and recovering the pastry between the

reliefs (24), the said rollers (9, 10) moving with a tangential speed equal to the speed of the said
transfer conveyor (4) and of the said feed conveyor (5, 7).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a table (1) with motorised
rollers receiving the moulds (2), the said table (10) having a transfer speed greater than the speed

of displacement of the transfer conveyor (4), and synchronised means (3) for feeding moulds (2)
on to the transfer conveyor (2).
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in that the said synchronised feed means is formed
by a controlled stop (3) interposed between the roller table (1) and the transfer conveyor (4).
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in that the synchronised feed means is formed by a
pinion synchronised with the speed of the transfer conveyor (4) and cooperating with a projection

or a recess of the moulds (2).
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the feed conveyor (7) for
the rolled-out pastry is mounted on a pivot (27) in order to ensure automatic centring of the

rolled-out pastry. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the feed conveyor (5, 7) is
equipped with a sensor (6) for measuring the thickness of the pastry, preferably a jet of

compressed air.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the pressure roller (10) is
mounted on a balance device, for example with counterweights (14).
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the cutting-out roller (9) is
maintained at a fixed spacing, controllable by means of a micrometer screw system for example.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the cutting-out roller (9)
and/or pressure roller (10) are formed by individuals rollers (15, 20) assembled side by side on a

driven axle (17, 21) synchronised with the feed conveyor (5) for the rolled-out pastry and the
transfer conveyor (4) for the moulds.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that a driven roller (8)
furnished with scarifying impressions is disposed on the feed conveyor (7) in contact with the

pastry.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the pressure roller (10) is
located upstream of the cutting-out roller (9).
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the cutting-out roller (9)
is located facing the feed conveyor (5, 7) for the rolled-out pastry.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that it comprises a device,
preferably a venturi device, for sucking out the scrap between the separated pieces and for

blocking off the sucking members to deposit the said scraps in a driven discharge conveyor.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that it comprises an inclined
downstream conveyor (11) with idle rollers for discharging the moulds (2) covered with pieces of

pastry. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 14, characterized in that it comprises driven
rollers driven at a linear speed greater than that of the transfer conveyor (4).
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 15, characterized in that the pressure roller (10) is
of synthetic food product material, polyethylene for example.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 16, characterized in that the moulds (2) and the
cutting-out roller (9) are of stainless steel, optionally covered with an anti-stick coating.
