<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speech
dialogue system and processing method therefor, for
interactive operation by a voice input for buying or
making reservation of an airplane ticket, a train
ticket or a hotel, for example. More specifically, the
invention relates to a speech dialogues system with
enhanced conversational ability between a user and the
system.Voice is one of most natural and easily used
man-machine interface for interaction with a system,
such as a computer system. It has been desired to
realize a speech dialogues system, with which a user
may achieve his object, such as buying of ticket, by
interaction with a computer by voice input.A Conventional speech dialogues system has been
discussed in "Development of Speaker Independent Speech Dialogues
System TOSBURG", Paper of Acoustic Science of Japan,
March, 1992, Pages 135 to 136. The above-identified
publication discloses a system, in which one phrase
completed in the meaning is taken as voice input, after
voice input of one phrase, word retrial, grammatic
meaning analysis (recognition and understanding), 
application process and voice response are performed,
and repeating the foregoing process, the process is
progressed in dialogues manner.However, in such conventional speech
dialogues interface, the following problems may
arise so that it cannot be the interface for the user
to easily use.At first, until one phrase of voice input is
completed, the system will not make any display or
voice response so that user may not confirm the result
of recognition and understanding. Therefore, only
after completion of input, the user may appreciate
error in recognition and understanding of the word. In
such case, it is frequently required to input the whole
phrase again. This clearly degrades a task
achievement.Secondly, when user makes input for one or
two clauses (or words) while considering the content of
speech, one or several clauses are taken as one phrase
to cause voice output as response messages at every
input of one or several clauses. Therefore, though the
result of recognition and understanding in the system
can be confirmed, the user should be interrupted for
consideration and voice input.In particular, upon an object directed
dialogue system, such as for buying of the airplane or
train ticket or making reservation of a hotel room, it 
should be natural and often occur that the user makes
voice input per small segment of the phrase with
consideration of content of display and/or response
given by the system rather than making voice
