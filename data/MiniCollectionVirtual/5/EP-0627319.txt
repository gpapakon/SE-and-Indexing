<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal dye diffusion printing,
further commonly referred to as sublimation printing, and more
particularly to a method for correcting across-the-head uneveness in
the printing density of a thermal sublimation print.Thermal sublimation printing uses a dye transfer process, in which a
carrier containing a dye is disposed between a receiver, such as a
transparant or a paper, and a print head formed of a plurality of
individual heat producing elements which will be referred to as
heating elements. The receiver is mounted on a rotatable drum. The
carrier and the receiver are generally moved relative to the print
head which is fixed. When a particular heating element is energised,
it is heated and causes dye to transfer, e.g. by diffusion or
sublimation, from the carrier to an image pixel (or "picture
element") in the receiver. The density of the printed dye is a
function of the temperature of the heating element and the time the
carrier is heated. In other words, the heat delivered from the
heating element to the carrier causes dye to transfer to the
receiver to make thereon an image related to the amount of heat.
Thermal dye transfer printer apparatus offer the advantage of true
"continuous tone" dye density transfer. By varying the heat applied
by each heating element to the carrier, a variable density image
pixel is formed in the receiver.
However, in systems utilising this type of thermal print head it is
often observed that the printing density is not uniform across the
page, but that lines, streaks, and bands are visible.Methods for correcting uneveness in the printed image are known from
prior art disclosed in U.S. 4,827,279 and in WO-A- 91 14577.
These methods however still leave some disturbing banding in the
printed image which will be perceived by the human eye, in
particular as the image is recorded on a transparant receiver. Moreover, if the image is intended to be used in medical
diagnostics, any banding is of special disturbance, because medical
diagnosis executed by the radiologist is intrinsically based upon
visual inspection of a radiographic image recorded on such a
transparant film.By the method of the present invention, an improved eveness in the
printing image is attained, which is remarkably better than the
state of the art. The main reason for the attained eveness may be
given by the fact that in the present invention only strongly
reduced lateral heatflows between neighbouring heating elements
exist, because all heating elements are activated with
