<DESCRIPTION>
Transimpedance amplifiers are utilized to convert current to voltage. In a 
typical transimpedance amplifier the current output by a photodiode is coupled to a 
transistor input stage. The transistor is generally either a bipolar or a junction FET 
type transistor. The transistor includes the so-called Miller capacitance (Cm) which 
effectively is coupled between the gate and drain of the FET type transistor. Cm is 
multiplied by 1 plus the voltage gain of the input stage of the transimpedance 
amplifier. Therefor, if a high gain transimpedance amplifier is desired, the 
bandwidth is severely limited by the Cm. It therefore would be desirable to provide a transimpedance amplifier with a 
high gain, while maintaining a wide bandwidth and stable operation. A transimpedance amplifier comprising the features listed in the preamble of claim 1 is 
known from an article ,,Digitale Übertragung mit Lichtwellenleitern" written by 
W. S. Ludolf and published in the magazine ,,Elektronik", Volume 14, No. 15 on 23.7.1991. 
In the circuit shown in Figure 13 of this article the base of the bipolar transistor is connected 
to ground through a resistor/capacitor network. The output of the FET is not only coupled 
to the emitter of said bipolar transistor, but is furthermore coupled to the voltage supply via 
a resistor. GB-2 064 254 A shows a photo feedback preamplifier using photodiodes in the feedback 
path for an amplifier. The present invention as characterized in claim 1 describes an improved transimpedance 
amplifier having a wide bandwidth, stable operation and high gain. The input transistor 
stage of the improved transimpedance amplifier is formed by a cascode input stage. The 
cascode input stage includes a JFET transistor coupled to a photodiode output providing 
the current input for the transimpedance amplifier. The output of the JFET transistor is 
coupled only to the emitter of a bipolar transistor having its base directly grounded. The 
JFET reduces current noise in the transimpedance amplifier and the bipolar transistor 
provides the required high gain while coupling the Cm directly to ground. The output of the 
bipolar transistor is coupled through the base of a second bipolar transistor which provides 
a buffer for the transimpedance amplifier. Preferred embodiments and details of the invention are described in the dependent claims. These and other features and advantages of the invention will be more readily 
apparent upon reading the following description of a preferred exemplified 
embodiment of
