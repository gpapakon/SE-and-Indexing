<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for sequentially 
printing lines of image dots or pixels in the 

thermal printing of a two-dimensional image on a 
wide receiver media employing a print head (10) 

arrangement of the type comprising a plurality 
N
 of 
linear thermal print head segments (50₁ - 50
n
) each 
comprising a set 
n
 of thermal print elements, each 
element having a data bit input terminal, in an 

alternating, staggered pattern in first and second 
rows of 
N₁
 and 
N₂
 print head segments arranged across 
the media in a print line direction such that 

respective sub-sets of 
n₁
 thermal print elements of 
the adjacent ends of the 
N₁
 and 
N₂
 print head 
segments arranged in the first and second rows 

overlap in the print line direction. The apparatus 
operates in accordance with the steps of 

successively processing each line of image print 
data into first and second print line data sub-sets 

(70, 80) which, when applied to the respective first 
and second rows of print head segments, print 

respective first and second line sub-images each 
having a complete segment(74, 84) and a partially 

complete segment (72, 82), wherein the partially 
complete segments positionally overlap one another. 

The partially complete segment of the first line 
sub-image has its complete areas distributed 

throughout the segment in a certain pattern, which 
may reflect an arbitrary or random distribution. 

The partially complete segment of the second line 
sub-image has its complete areas distributed 

throughout the segment in a pattern that is  
 

complementary to the pattern of complete areas of 
the partially complete segment of the first line 

sub-image. The complete areas of the overlapping 
partially complete segments of the first and second 

line sub-images thus spatially fill-in to overlap 
each other so that the 

sub-images combine to produce a complete line image. The 
distribution pattern varies and does not produce a 

substantial linear alignment of the blank areas of each 
complete se
gment with those of the following complete 
segment or segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention--The present invention 
relates to a thermal line printer of the type having 
a divided line head composed of a plurality of 
linear thermal head segments or "tiles" aligned in 
the width direction of a recording medium sheet 
perpendicular to the feeding direction or the 
lengthwise direction of the recording medium sheet 
so that a predetermined number of thermal print 
elements of adjacent tiles overlap so as to cover 
the entire span or width of the recording medium 
sheet, and particularly to a system for distributing 
print data bits among the overlapping print 
elements. Description of the Prior Art--Typical thermal line 
print heads are constructed with a linear array of 
thermal print elements that are individually heated 
by data encoded energization signals to effect by 
sublimation the transfer of a dye donor onto the 
pixel or dot area line by line onto a moving a 
receiver sheet to form a two-dimensional image 
thereon. In such printers, the linear array 
segments are typically constructed to extend about 
12 inches in width and are capable of printing lines 
of image pixels across typical 11 inch (or less) 
printing paper. The dye-donor film patches are 
similarly dimensioned so that it is not possible to 
print color images of a single image frame exceeding 
the widths of the linear array and the dye donor 
patch. The dye donor patch is also limited in 
length.  In order to overcome the length limitation of 
the dye donor patches, commonly assigned U.S. Patent 
Nos. 5,132,701 and 5,140,341 to Stephenson and 
Fiscella describe a system and method for 
successively printing each of the three, single 
color separation, two-dimensional images in 
superimposition on a receiver to form a complete 
multi-color image having a length exceeding the 
comparable length of the dye-donor patches. Two (or 
more) dye donor patches of the same color are 
employed in the printing of each of the color 
separation images in an image region on the receiver 
sheet. The data set for the entire, two-dimensional, 
color separation image is divided into 
first and second sub-image data sets for respective 
first and second sub-images in the length dimension, 
wherein the sub-images overlap one another in an 
overlap region comprising a certain number of print 
lines. The corresponding overlap line print data is 
distributed in a complementary manner in the first 
and second sub-image data sets with a blank print 
data bit pattern to mask any straight line effect at 
the boundary of the two
