<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention a wire raceway to be mounted to 
a lower portion of a modular wall panel (10) is disclosed 

comprising
 

   an elongated U-shaped member (32), within which passes 
electricla wires (58), having a longitudinal axis and two 

upstanding sidewalls (42) with unsupported edges,
 

   cover means (30) attached to an open portion of siad U-shaped 
member, and

 
   a receptacle (24), having an outwardly facing surface, to 

be mounted to the side walls 842) of said U-shaped member and 
adapted to be electrically connected to said electrical wires,

 
   a multiple of slots (102) on two opposite sides of said 

receptacle (24) located varying distances from the outwardly 
facing surface, and

 
   an opening (66) in the sidewall of the U-shaped channel 

having at least two sides parallel to each other and adapted 
to mate with any two slots (102) on opposite sides of said 

receptacle,
 

   whereby the distance between the outwardly facing surface 
of the receptacle (24) and an outer surface of the side walls 

(42) of the U-shaped member (32) will be determined depending 
upon which one slot on each opposite side of said receptacle 

is chosen to slide over the two sides of the openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of power, 
distribution systems, and particularly, to a wire race way 
according to the preamble of claim 1, which corresponds to the prior art disclosed in GB-A-2 059 183. There are various environments wherein a plurality of 
different power lines, including power circuits and ground 
circuits, lead from different transformers, fuses and the 
like, to a given area for distribution therat. Most often, a 
plurality of electrical connectors are used for 
interconnection, respectively, with the different power lines. 
For instance, the connectors may be provided in the form of 
plug-receiving receptacles and each receptacle is 
interconnected to an individual power line. An example of such an environment is in the art of modular 
wall panel systems which divide a given area into separate or 
distinct work areas. All kinds of electronic equipment, such 
as computers, printers, heaters and the like may be employed 
in each work area and must be "plugged-in" to the power 
distribution lines. The utilization of an electrical connector 
for each separate power distribution line results in very 
cumbersome outlet configurations involving a multiplicity of 
receptacles or outlets and an undesirable duplicity  
 
of many of the connector components. The need for 
a plurality of power lines can range from the 
obvious necessity of preventing overloading of a 
given line, to the need for providing an isolated 
or "clean" line having an isolated ground whereby 
sensitive equipment such as computers or delicate 
sensing devices are not exposed to current spikes 
or impulses caused by other electrical equipment, 
such as a heater, being interconnected to the same 
power line. An example of a problem which could 
occur when sharing such equipment is the accidental 
erasure of computer data, for instance. There is a need for, and it would be 
highly desirable to provide a power distribution 
system for the electrification of a given area 
utilizing a plurality of power distribution lines, 
wherein a common receptacle can be used in 
conjunction with interchangeable circuit control 
modules for interchangeably interconnecting the 
common receptacle with any one of the different 
power lines. This invention is directed to 
satisfying this need and solving the problems 
identified above. An object, therefore, of the invention is 
to provide an improved power distribution system 
including a new concept of utilizing 
interchangeable circuit control modules. The invention comprises

<CLAIMS>
Wire raceway adapted to be mounted to a lower portion of a 
modular wall panel (10) and including: 


an elongated U-shaped member (32), within which pass 
electrical wires (58), and having a longitudinal axis and two 

upstanding sidewalls (42) with unsupported edges, and 
a receptacle (24), having an outwardly facing surface, and adapted to 
be mounted to the side walls (42) of said U-shaped member and 

adapted to be electrically connected to said electrical wires, 
 
   characterized by 


cover means (30) attached to an open portion of said U-shaped member, 
a plurality of slots (102) on two opposite sides of said 
receptacle (24) located varying distances from the outwardly 

facing surface, and 
an opening (66) in the sidewall of the U-shaped channel 
having at least two sides parallel to each other and adapted 

to mate with any two slots (102) on opposite sides of said 
receptacle, 
whereby the distance between the outwardly facing surface 
of the receptacle (24) and an outer surface of the side walls 

(42) of the U-shaped member (32) will be determined depending 
upon which one slot on each opposite side of said receptacle 

is chosen to slide over the two sides of the openings. 
Wire raceway as set forth in claim 1, wherein the 
two sides (104) in said opening (66) are oriented so that 

they are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the raceway 
and pass through the unsupported extending edge of the sidewall 

(42) of the U-shaped channel (32) thereby forming an opening 
having three sides.  

 
Wire raceway as set forth in claim 2 wherein the cover 
means (30) is adapted to contact the upper portion of the 

receptacle (24) to further hold the receptacle in the opening 
(66) in the sidewall (42) of the U-shaped channel.
