<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an electrical switching installation having a plurality of switches for each phase, for example an earthing switch (1), a disconnector (2) and a circuit breaker (3), at least one of the switches, for example the earthing switch, has a motor drive (10) and a detachable mechanical coupling (5) which transmits the drive movement. The coupling (5) can be disengaged by operation of the disconnector (2) when it is being connected, so that, when the disconnector (2) is being connected, the earthing switch (1) cannot be moved into the earthing position, and this prevents high-voltage potential being connected to the earth potential.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical switchgear having several switches 
(1 - 4) for each phase, whereby at least one switch (1, 

4) has a motor drive (10, 12), and a releasable 
mechanical coupling (5, 7) is provided between the one 

switch (1, 4) and the motor drive (10, 12),
 
characterized in that the switches carry out different 

switching functions and in this respect are represented 
by a circuit breaker (3), at least one disconnecting 

switch (2) and at least one earthing switch (1, 4), and 
in that the earthing switch (1, 4) has a motor drive 

(10, 12) and a coupling (5, 7) and the disconnecting 
switch (2) has another motor drive (11) and another 

coupling (6), whereby the coupling (5, 7) and the 
additional coupling (6) can be engaged or disengaged 

alternately by influencing another switch (1, 2, 3). 
Electrical switchgear according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the coupling (5, 7) of the 

earthing switch (1, 4) and the additional coupling (6) 
of the disconnecting switch (2) can be actuated by 

means of a push/pull cable pull (13, 14, 15, 16). 
Electrical switchgear according to claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the additional coupling (6) of 

the disconnecting switch (2) can be disengaged by 
connecting the circuit breaker (3). 
Electrical switchgear according to claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the additional coupling (6) of 

the disconnecting switch (2) can be disengaged by 
connecting an earthing switch (1, 4) into the earthing 

position and/or by connecting the circuit breaker (3). 
Electrical switchgear according to claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the coupling (5, 7) of the 

earthing switch (1, 4) can be disengaged by connecting 
the disconnecting switch (2).
