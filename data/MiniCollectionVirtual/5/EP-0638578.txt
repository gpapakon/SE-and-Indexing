 in which R is hydrogen, an aryl or benzyl group or a straight-chain or branched alkyl group, n is 1 or 2 and M is potassium or sodium. To prepare these phosphanes, either alkali metal salts of fluorobenzene-2,4-disulphonic acid with phosphorus hydride, primary or secondary phosphanes or secondary phosphanes of the type HP[C6H3-2,4-(SO3M)2]2 are reacted with a compound RX in which H is an alkyl, aryl or benzyl group and X is a halogen, in an aprotic solvent in the presence of at least stoichiometric amounts of solid pulverised alkali metal hydroxide at temperatures from 0 to 100 DEG C.

Secondary and tertiary phosphanes of the formula


where R stands for hydrogen, an aryl or benzyl group or a straight-chain or
branched alkyl group, n is 1 or 2 and M denotes potassium or sodium.
The process for the preparation of phosphanes according to claim 1,
characterised in that alkali metal salts of fluorobenzene-2,4-disulfonic acid

are reacted with hydrogen phosphide, primary or secondary phosphanes in
an apriotic solvent in the presence of at least stoichiometric amounts of solid

pulverised alkali metal hydroxide at temperatures of 0 to 100°C.
The process according to claim 2, characterised in that the reaction takes
place at pressures of up to 10 bar, preferably up to 2 bar.

is reacted with a compound RX, in which R stands for an alkyl,
aryl or benzyl group and X is a halogen, in an apriotic solvent in the

presence of at least stoichiometric amounts of solid pulverised alkali metal
hydroxide at temperatures of 0 to 100°C.
The process according to at least one of the claims 2 through 4,
characterised in that dimethylsulfoxide is used as the solvent.
