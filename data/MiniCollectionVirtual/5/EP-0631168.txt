<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor optical device such as a light 
modulator has a light absorbing/transmitting layer (12) 

responsive to an electric field for changing the intensity 
of an output light, and the light absorbing/transmitting 

layer (12) is implemented by a type-II super-lattice structure 
formed by using a first compound semiconductor material 

(InAlAs) and a second compound semiconductor material (n-InP), 
wherein the second compound semiconductor material is 

larger in electron affinity as well as the total of 
electron affinity and energy band gap than the first 

compound semiconductor material so that a large extinction 
ratio is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor optical 
device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor optical 
device such as a light modulator and a tunable laser 
emitting diode incorporated in an optical communication 
system. Conventionally, a light signal is directly modulated 
by a single-mode semiconductor laser device for 
transferring pieces of information through a long 
wavelength optical communication system. However, a 
modulation system separated from the semiconductor laser 
device is appropriate for a high-speed large-capacity 
optical transmission system, and the modulation system 
usually includes a light modulation device for imposing 
pieces of information on a carrier. A semiconductor 
tunable laser emitting device has been studied for a 
multiple wave transmission system. Various light modulation devices have been proposed. 
However, an electro-absorption type and an electro-refraction 
type are attractive in view of the device size  
 
and the facility, and a large number of papers have 
reported these attractive points. One of the papers is 
entitled as "High-Speed Electroabsorption Modulator with 
Strip-Loaded GaInAsP Planar Waveguid", IEEE Journal of 
Lightwave Technology, vol. LT-4, No. 10, October 1986, pages 
1445-1452, and another paper is "Miniature Mach-Zehnder 
InGaAsP Quantum Well Waveguide Interferometers for 1.3 
microns", IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, vol. 2, No. 1, 
January 1990, pages 32-34. Yet another paper is 
"InGaAs/InAlAs MQW Optical Modulator", Technical Reports of 
Electro-Information Communication Society, OQE91-57, pages 
69-74 (1991). Figure 1 illustrates a prior art semiconductor light 
modulation device 1 of the electro-absorption type coupled 
with a signal source 2, and the semiconductor light 
modulation device 1 has a light absorbing/transmitting 
layer 1a. The light absorbing/transmission layer 1a is 
formed of an intrinsic semiconductor material, and forms a 
pin structure. In operation, the signal source 2 supplies an 
electric signal to the semiconductor light modulation 
device 1, and the electric signal varies the applied 
electric field. Then, the light absorbing/transmission  
 
layer 1a changes the absorbance around the wavelength at 
the absorption edge, and transfers an incident light to the 
opposite end as a transmission light different in intensity 
from the incident light. If the light absorbing/transmitting layer 1a is a 
semiconductor bulk, the light absorption is carried out 
through the Franz-Kaldysh effect. When an electric
