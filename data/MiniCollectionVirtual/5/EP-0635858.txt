<ABSTRACT>
The manipulator according to the invention comprises a disc (8) mounted so as to rotate about an axis by virtue of a shaft (7) and capable of swivelling about a centre of rotation (0), with elastic return to a rest position, a detector (15, 16) serving to determine the angular position of the disc (8) relative to the axis, strain gauges (G) allowing the orientation of the disc (8) to be determined relative to the centre of rotation (0), a switch (T1) making it possible to pass from an operating mode in which the information relating to the orientation of the shaft (7) is acted upon, to an operating mode in which the information on the angular position of the disc (8) is acted upon, and a switch making it possible to validate one or the other of these information items. The invention applies particularly to remote control, to the steering or equally to the management of a cursor on a screen.

<CLAIMS>
A manipulator with multiple operating modes 
that can be used notably for the management of a cursor 

(C) on a display (2) associated with a processor, (3) 
characterized in that it comprises : 


a control device (8) mounted rotatably about an axis 
of rotation by means of a substantially coaxial 

shaft, 
an articulating means (10) enabling said shaft (7) to 
pivot about a center of rotation (0) under the effect 

of a force exerted on said control device (8) with 
elastic return motion to the home position once said 

exertion ceases, 
a means (15, 16) enabling detection of the angular 
position of said control device (8) about said axis 

(7), 
a means (G) enabling detection of the orientation of 
said shaft (7) about said center of rotation (0), 
a reverse switching means (T
1
) enabling switching from 
a first operating mode, in which at least the data 

relating to the orientation of said shaft (7) are 
taken into account, to a second operating mode in 

which only said data relating to the angular position 
of said control device (8) are taken into account, 
a means enabling validation of the data detected by 
said detecting means (G, 15, 16) and pertaining to 

the angular position of said control device (8) and 
to the orientation of said shaft (7). 
The manipulator as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that said articulating means consists 

in a flexible portion (10) of said shaft (7), and in 
that, in this case, the means enabling detection of the 

orientation of said shaft consists in a strain gauge 
device (G) arranged at the level of said portion (10). 
The manipulator as claimed in claim 1,
  
 

characterized in that said articulating means consists 
in a pivot link (36, 37) provided between a fixed or 

translatable supporting structure and a central region 
of said shaft (35), and in that, in this case, the 

means enabling detection of the orientation of said 
shaft consists in a strain gauge device (38) coupled 

with the end of said shaft (35) opposite said control 
device (8). 
The manipulator as claimed in one of claims 1 
and 2,
 
characterized in that said shaft (7) is axially mobile 

against the action of an elastic means (9), and in that 
it controls a switch (17) and/or a strain gauge (19) 

sensitive to the axial displacements of said shaft (7). 
The manipulator as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that said means enabling detection of 

the angular position of said control device (8) 
consists in a code wheel (16) borne by said shaft (7) 

and associated with a detector (15). 
The manipulator as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that said shaft (7) is tubular, and in 

that said validating means comprises a push-button (13) 
mounted slidably with spring-loaded return motion into 

a central cavity (11) which is coaxial with the control 
device (8) and cooperates with a switch (18). 
The manipulator as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that it comprises a plurality of keys 

(T
1
 to T
4
) arranged around the control device (8). 
The manipulator as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that said control device (8) is 

covered with a touch-sensitive layer (26) susceptible  
 

of detecting the presence and/or contact of one of the 
operator's fingers. 
The manipulator as claimed in one of the 
preced
ing claims,
 
characterized in that said communicating means (T
1
 to 
T
4
) enables switching to a third operating mode taking 
into account both the data relating to the angular 

position of said control device (8) and the data 
relating to the orientation of said shaft (7). 
The manipulator as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the rotation of said control 

device (8) and/or the pivoting of said shaft (7) 
command(s) the orientation of said cursor, the 

displacement thereof in the direction selected being 
subsequently obtained by action on a reverse switching 

means.
