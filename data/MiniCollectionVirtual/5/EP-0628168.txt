<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a novel method for decreasing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) synthesis in a mammal such as a human comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a molecule capable of binding to a mammalian POMC mRNA stem loop structure. The invention further provides a method for increasing POMC synthesis in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of an mRNA POMC stem-loop structure. A method of identifying compounds capable of modulating POMC synthesis in a mammal is also provided. The method comprises identifying compounds which bind to a proopiomelanocortin mRNA stem-loop structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR MODULATING PROOPIOMELANOCORTIN SYNTHESIS IN A MAMMALFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the field of mammalian therapeutics. More particularly, methods of modulating proopiomelanocortin (POMC) synthesis in a mammal are provided involving administering to the mammal either proteins which bind to the stem-loop structure of the POMC mRNA or the stem- loop structures themselves.GOVERNMENT RIGHTSThe work presented herein may have been supported in part by National Institute of Health grant DK36054. The United States Government may have certain rights in the invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProopiomelanocortin (POMC) , the precursor protein for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) , /3-endorphin and melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSH) , is synthesized in brain, pituitary and peripheral tissues. Regulation of POMC gene expression is tissue-specific. In the anterior pituitary, gene expression is stimulated by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) [Fleischer, N. et al. (1970), Am . J. Physiol . 219, 445-452, Gilles, G. et al. (1978). Endocrinology. 103, 521-529] and inhibited by glucocorticoids [Fleischer, N. et al. supra (1970) , Buckingham, J. et al. (1977) . J. Endocrinol . 72, 187-193, Birnberg, N. , et al. (1983). Proc . 

Natl - Acad. Sci . USA. 80, 6982-6986, Eberwine, J. et al. (1984). J. Biol . Chem. 259, 2166-2170, Schachter, B. et al. (1982). Endocrinology. 110, 1442-1444], while in the intermediate lobe, dopamine serves as the primary inhibitor [Hollt, V. et al. (1982), Endocrinology, 110, 1885-1894,Chen, C. , et al. (1984). Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . USA 80, 2211- 2215] . The time-course of these responses are such that changes in protein synthesis and secretion are apparent within a few minutes of stimulation, while changes in mRNA levels are observed after 6 hours of treatment. These temporal differences suggest that protein synthesis is regulated differently from transcription.The translation of mRNA can be directly altered by changes in the secondary structure of the mRNA or by protein- RNA or RNA-RNA interactions. The process of protein synthesis requires the interplay of nearly 100 different molecules, some of which interact to form protein-mRNA complexes, resulting in an alteration in the secondary and tertiary structure of the mRNA, thereby facilitating or hindering the translational process. Translation is dependent upon the rate of ribosome binding to mRNA, the number of ribosomes attached to a single mRNA molecule, the rate of translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA
