<ABSTRACT>
Spectacles wherein, in the case of directly supporting lenses by parts of spectacles other than rims, design restriction is limited, 
and moreover, a high machining precision is not required. The present invention is characterized in that lenses are directly 

supported by gripping means for gripping lenses. It is preferable that the gripping means are provided with resilient means for 
urging portions of the gripping means which are in contact with the lenses against the lenses through spring tensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The resent invention relates to a spectacle having
lenses supported by spectacle parts other than a rim, in accordance
with the preamble of claim 1 and 14.A spectacle of this type is known from US-A-943 085.The clamp means comprises a spring, one part of which
is inserted into a hole, the other part gripping the edge of the lens.A further conventional spectacle is
disclosed for example in the Japanese Utility Model Laid-open
Publication No. HEI 4-61311.
Fitting portions or parts having elastic and
springy property are formed to end portions of a bridge, an
end plate, a pad and the like,
and such elastic fitting parts are fitted into holes formed
into the lenses and fixed thereto.In this known art, however, the elastic fitting
parts are fitted and fixed to the holes of the lenses by
applying pressure, so that the formation of relatively large
holes to the lenses are required, thus providing a problem on
design. Similar prior art spectacles are known from WO-87/04806 and GB-A-2645.Furthermore, if the hole is not formed exactly,
there is risk of
disengaging the spectacle parts from the lenses.
If the fitting force is increased, there is the risk 
of damaging or breaking the lenses. The requirement of the
exact working performance will result in worse productivity.An object of the present invention is to
provide
a spectacle having spectacle parts directly attached to the
lenses, without substantial limitations on the spectacle
design, wherein the spectacle can manufactured with relatively low
working performance.To achieve the above object, the present invention
is characterized by the features of claim 1 or 14.Here, the term "clamp" includes snapping and
supporting functions, in both cases, one in which a force is
applied in the clamp means closing direction to thereby snap
the lens and other in which a force is applied to the clamp
means opening direction and acting a reaction force of the
lens to snap the clamp means.According to the present invention, the lens is
clamped only by the clamp means, so that a precise hole
forming working, as in the conventional technique, is not 
required.The clamp means is provided
with an elastic means for pressing the lens contacting
portion of the clamp means against the lens by utilizing the
springy elastic property.The lens
contacting portion of the clamp means is treated for increasing the friction
resistance thereof.The working for increasing the friction resistance
may be made by making coarse at least one of the contacting
surfaces of the clamp means and the lens,

<CLAIMS>
A spectacle having lenses (2) supported by spectacle parts other than
a rim wherein the lenses (2) are directly supported by clamp means (5,

5a, 5b, 5c ...; 51, 151, 52 ..) for clamping the lenses (2) and the clamp
means is provided with an elastic means pressing a lens contacting portion

of the clamp means against the lenses (2) by utilizing spring force
of the elastic means, 
characterized in that t
he lens contacting portion
of the clamp means (5, 5a, 5b, 5c ...; 51, 151, 52) is subjected to a

working for increasing the friction resistance by making coarse a surface
of at least one of contacting surfaces of the clamp means (5, 5a, 5b, 5c

...; 51, 151, 52) and the lens (2) or by forming an irregular surface
portion (54, 154, 54b, 55c; 62, 63, 64 ...) to at least one of the contacting

surfaces of the clamp means and the lens (2).
