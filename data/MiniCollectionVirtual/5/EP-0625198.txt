<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a method for producing a DNA sequence encoding human osteogenic protein, OP-1, by recombinant DNA techniques. This sequence is employed in the preparation of recombinant baculovirus, which can be used to infect cells of Spodoptera frugiperda. Culturing such infected cells results in the production of physiologically active OP-1 protein, which can be employed to produce pharmaceutical compositions useful in the treatment of bone diseases, orthopedic diseases, bone defects, and trauma. Also provided are a recombinant baculovirus containing DNA encoding human OP-1, and insect cells infected with this recombinant baculovirus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
obtaining human osteogenic protein, OP-1, via
recombinant DNA technology. This process is exemplified
by infecting cells of Spodoptera frugiperda with a
recombinant baculovirus to produce the mature,
biologically active form of OP-1.Osteogenic factor OP-1 belongs, in view of its
biological activity, to the family of Bone Morphogenic
Proteins (BMPs), which are factors responsible for the
induction of cartilage and bone.BMPs form part of the large superfamily of TGF-β
(Transforming Growth Factor β), a family that includes
embryonic morphogens, endocrine function regulators,
wide-range regulators, and regulators that are specific
for cell proliferation and differentiation.TGF-β is a prototype of this family. It is a dimer 
of two identical chains of 112 amino acids held together
by disulfide bridges. Each chain is synthesized starting
from a longer precursor of about 390 amino acids which
has the characteristics of a secretory polypeptide,
presenting a hydrophobic sequence in the N-terminal
region which should function as a secretory peptide for
the secretion of the molecule. The precursor is then
processed to its mature form by cleavage by a specific
peptidase, which cleaves four basic amino acids
immediately prior to the biologically active domain. The
precursor region plays an essential role in the correct
folding of the mature portion invivo, to the extent
that to date, no mature, biologically active peptides
are known to have been produced in Escherichia coli by
recombinant DNA techniques.These factors are known in various animal species
from Drosophila to humans, their sequences having been
maintained to a great extent throughout evolution.
The sequence homology among the various polypeptides is
very high, and resides mainly in the C-terminal region.
The degree of identity of sequence varies between 25 and
90% among the various family members. In this region,
between 7 and 9 cysteines are conserved among all the
members. These are involved in the formation of
disulfide bridges between the amino-acid chains.BMPs induce chemotactic, proliferative and
differential responses, which culminate in the transient
formation of cartilage, followed by the accumulation of
bone with hematopoietic marrow. The activity of BMPs
has been characterized as strictly linked with the
demineralized bone matrix, and is extractable with
denaturing agents. They have in fact been extracted
from various species including humans, monkeys, cattle,
rats and mice (Sampath, T. K., Reddi,
