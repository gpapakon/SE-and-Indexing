<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a film forming solution
from which a poly(4,4'-oxydiphenylenepyromellitimide) porous
film can be obtained, a porous film obtained therefrom and a
coated material in which the porous film is formed on a base
material.Among the aromatic polyimides, poly(4,4'-oxydiphenylenepyromellitimide)
is widely used in films,
coating materials, moldings and the like, as a polymer having
excellent heat resistance and dynamic characteristics.Journal of Polymer Science, Macromolecular Reviews,
Vol.11 (1976) discloses, in Table 2 on page 164, solvents
capable of dissolving poly(4,4'-oxydiphenylenepyromellitamic
acid) which is a typical precursor of poly(4,4'-oxydiphenylenepyromellitimide).
Listed in this table as
illustrative solvents are N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA),
N-methylcaprolactam, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-acetyl-2-pyrrolidone,
N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and the like.
These solvents can dissolve the polyimide precursor when used
alone and are called aprotic polar solvents. In addition,
this reference discloses that these solvents can be used not
only for dissolving a poly(amic acid) but also as a 
polymerization solvent when a poly(amic acid) is produced by
the polymerization of a diamine with a tetracarboxylic acid
dianhydride.This same reference also discloses, on pages 199 to
205, that polyimide films can be obtained by removing
solvents from solutions of poly(amic acid) dissolved in these
aprotic polar solvents and carrying out imidization, and that
polyimide-coated materials can be obtained by coating base
materials with these solutions, followed by solvent removal
and imidization.EP 532 053 discloses a polyimide precursor Solution and a
process for the production thereof. This polyimide precursor
solution comprises a polyimide precursor and a solvent wherein
the polyimide precursor and the solvent are not solvated
strongly. The precursor is an aromatic poly-amic acid
prepared from an aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride and an
aromatic diamine. The solvent may be a mixture of two or more
solvents. The obtained precursor solution has an improved
storage stability and can be used for the production of
polyimide films, coatings and the like.Polyimide precurosr solutions prepared using DMAc, NMP,
DMSO, DMF and the like aprotic polar solvents are also
disclosed in the U.S. Patent 4,238,528, JP-B-3-4588 (The term
"JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent
publication") and IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin,
