<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a melt-processible blend. It also concerns a process for
producing the melt-processible blend and use of the melt-processible blend.Polymer blends are very important to the plastics industry and are well known.
Miscible polymer blends, often referred to as polymer alloys, are desirable and useful
because they provide a unique combination of properties from two or more polymers
which one polymer alone cannot provide. In particular, blend polymers such as
polymethyl methacrylate (pMMA) and polycarbonate, for example, bisphenol-A
polycarbonate (PC) would be highly desirable and commercially useful materials for
producing miscible transparent polymer blends. These materials are desirable and
useful because pMMA is a clear, relatively inexpensive polymer with excellent light
transmission and resistance to sunlight and PC is a clear polymer with the
advantageous properties of toughness and high heat resistance. Unfortunately, pMMA
lacks heat resistance and is brittle so it cannot be used in all applications, and PC is a
relatively expensive polymer. It is therefore desirable to achieve fully miscible polymer
blends of pMMA and PC. Such blends would offer variable property/cost behavior
properties based on blend ratios of pMMA and PC between the limits of pure pMMA
and pure PC, while maintaining optical clarity.Unfortunately, pMMA and PC are known not to be compatible or miscible. Melt
processed blends of pMMA and PC having commercially useful molecular weights,
such as weight average molecular weights of about 70,000 or more, are not
homogeneous. Phase separation of such blends occurs at temperatures just above the
glass transition temperature of the blend. The melt processing temperature required for
polycarbonate or PC is typically 100 degrees Celsius (°C) above its glass transition
temperature (Tg), and in this case about 100°C above the Tg range for polycarbonates, of
150°C to 250°C, and at that processing temperature, blends of pMMA and PC are
inhomogeneous and opaque, and have undesirable mechanical properties. It is
therefore desirable to achieve a blend of pMMA and PC that remains as a single
phase at melt-processing temperatures.The "cloud point temperature" is an important factor in blend miscibility, as it is
the temperature at which the blend changes from clear to "cloudy," because of phase
separation. To be melt-processible, the cloud point of the PC and MMA copolymer
blend should be ≥ 250°C. If a comonomer is not particularly efficient at altering the 
phase behavior of
