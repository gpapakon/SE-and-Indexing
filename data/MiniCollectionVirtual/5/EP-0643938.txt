<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide varied grip characteristics, a rail member 
(1) of a grab-rail has an outer surface with a plurality of 

longitudinally extending ribs (4) positioned to provide a rough zone 
which is adjacent to a smooth zone. Preferably, the cross-section 

of the rail member is elliptical so that the rail member may be 
mounted in a non-rotatable manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a grab-rail which is, for example, 
positionable by a bath to assist a user of the bath to get into and out of the 
bath. US-A-4,895,332 discloses a grab-rail having a rail member whose 
generally circular outer surface includes roughened longitudinal elastomeric 
inserts for improving grip. DE-A-3,150,765 discloses a grab-rail of the 
folding type and AT-A-351,199 discloses a grab-rail of the fixed type. According to the present invention, there is provided a grab-rail 
comprising an elongate rail member having an outer surface with a plurality 
of longitudinally extending ribs positioned to provide a rough, first zone which 
is adjacent to a smoother, second zone; characterized in that the cross-section 
of the rail member is oval; and the first and second zones are disposed on 
respective sides of the major axis of the oval cross-section of the rail member. 
By means of the first and second zones, it is possible to provide enhanced grip 
where it is needed, by means of the first zone, and a cleaner visual appearance 
where grip is not needed, by means of the second zone. The grab-rail may be a folding grab-rail, wherein a base portion is 
securable to a support surface and the rail member is pivotably connected to 
the base portion so as to be movable between a first, generally horizontal 
position and a second, generally vertical position. It is preferable that the rail 
member is arranged so that, when in its first position, the rough, first zone 
faces downwards and the smoother, second zone faces upwards. With this 
arrangement, when the user grabs hold of the rail member, e.g. in order to 
get out of a bath, the user's fingers achieve a good grip on the underside of 
the rail member whilst ensuring that the top side of the rail member does not 
cause any discomfort to the palms of the user's hands. The grab-rail may be a fixed grab-rail wherein a bracket is fixed to 
each end of the rail member and is securable to a support surface. Preferably, 
the rail member is arranged so that the rough, first zone faces towards the 
support surface and the smoother, second zone faces away from the support 
surface.  
 Two non-limiting embodiments of the present invention will now 
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a fixed grab-rail; Figure 2 is a cross-section of the rail member of the fixed 
grab-rail of Figure 1; and Figure 3 is a perspective view of a folding grab-rail. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the

<CLAIMS>
A grab-rail comprising an elongate rail member (1) having an 
outer surface with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs (4) positioned 

to provide a rough, first zone which is adjacent to a smoother, second zone;
 
   characterized in that: 


the cross-section of the rail member (1) is oval; and 
the first and second zones are disposed on respective sides of the major 
axis of the oval cross-section of the rail member (1). 
A grab-rail according to claim 1, wherein the ribs (4) are 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rail member (1). 
A grab-rail according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the second zone 
is rib-free. 
A grab-rail according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
cross-section of the rail member (1) is elliptical. 
A grab-rail according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein each 
zone covers substantially half of the outer surface of the rail member (1). 
A grab-rail according to any one of claims 1 to 5, further 
comprising a base portion (5) securable to a support surface, the rail 

member (1) being pivotably connected to the base portion so as to be movable 
between a first, generally horizontal position and a second, generally vertical 

position.  
 
A grab-rail according to claim 6, wherein the rail member (1) 
is arranged so that, when in its first position, the rough, first zone faces 

downwards and the smoother, second zone faces upwards. 
A grab-rail according to any one of claims 1 to 5, further 
comprising a bracket (2) fixed to each end of the rail member (1) and 

securable to a support surface. 
A grab-rail according to claim 8, wherein the rail member is 
arranged so that the rough, first zone faces towards the support surface and 

the smoother, second zone faces away from the support surface. 
A grab-rail according to claim 4, wherein the rail member (1) 
is hollow and the grab-rail includes bosses which are of elliptical cross-section 

and project into the hollow ends of the rail member to prevent rotation of the 
rail member.
