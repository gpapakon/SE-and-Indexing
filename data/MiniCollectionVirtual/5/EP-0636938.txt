<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide light-sensitive material is disclosed. 
The light-sensitive material comprises an aluminum support, 

an anodic oxide layer and a light-sensitive polymerizable 
layer in the order. The light-sensitive polymerizable 

layer contains silver halide, a reducing agent and an 
ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compound or a 

cross-linkable polymer. According to the present invention, 
an intervening layer is further provided between the 

anodic oxide layer and the light-sensitive polymerizable 
layer. The intervening layer contains a compound having a 

metal cation or a metal oxide anion. The metal cation or 
the metal oxide anion has a standard electrode potential of 

0 V or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
light-sensitive material, which comprises a support and a 
light-sensitive polymerizable layer containing silver 
halide, a reducing agent and an ethylenically unsaturated 
polymerizable compound or a cross-linkable polymer. The 
invention particularly relates to the silver halide light-sensitive 
material having an aluminum support. U.S. Patent No. 4,629,676 (Hayakawa et al) and 
European Patent Publication No. 0174634B1 disclose an image 
forming method comprising the steps of imagewise exposing 
to light a light-sensitive material, and heating the light-sensitive 
material. The light-sensitive material comprises 
a support and a light-sensitive layer containing silver 
halide, a reducing agent and a polymerizable compound. The 
light-sensitive material is heated to develop the silver 
halide and to harden the polymerizable compound is hardened. The support of the light-sensitive material can be 
made of various substances, such as a paper, a synthetic 
paper, a plastic film and a metal plate. A paper laminated 
with a synthetic resin (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, 
polystyrene) is also available. The paper or the plastic 
film may be laminated with a metal. Further, a metal may 
be evaporated on the paper or the plastic film. The above-mentioned image forming method is available 
for forming a lithographic plate. U.S. Patent No.  
 
5,122,443 (Takeda) and European Patent Publication No. 
0426192B1 disclose a method of forming the lithographic 
plate. The support of the lithographic plate is preferably 
made of an aluminum plate, a polyethylene terephthalate 
film, a paper or a synthetic paper. The aluminum plate is 
particularly preferred. The aluminum support has been used in not only the 
above-mentioned method using silver halide but also conventional 
methods of forming lithographic plate using a photopolymer. 
The aluminum support usually has an anodic oxide 
layer. The surface of the aluminum support may be treated to 
form a rough surface (graining treatment) or a hydrophilic 
surface (Japanese Patent Publication No. 47(1972)-5125 and 
U.S. Patents No. 3,834,498 and No. 4,087,341). An intervening 
(undercoating) layer of a hydrophilic compound may 
be provided on the aluminum support to decrease stains in 
printed matters (U.S. Patents No. 2,098,627 and No. 
3,860,426 and Japanese Patent Provisional Publications No. 
60(1985)-149491 and 4(1992)-282637). The stains are caused 
by contamination of a light-sensitive layer within non-image 
are
