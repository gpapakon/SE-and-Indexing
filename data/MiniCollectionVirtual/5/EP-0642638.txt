<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
radial lip seal and wear sleeve assembly and 
particularly to such an assembly which prevents 
undesired contact between a pair of seal lips and a 
coacting wear sleeve during shipping, installation 
and use. A unitized radial lip seal and wear sleeve 
assembly is shown in U.S. Patent 4,936,591 to 
Romero. This assembly includes an outer case 
installable in a housing and an inner case 
installable on a shaft extending through or within 
the housing. The inner case includes a tubular 
wall which is press-fit on the shaft to provide a 
sealing surface for a resilient elastomeric sealing 
element carried by the outer case. The tubular 
wall is sometimes referred to as a wear sleeve. Use of a wear sleeve is advantageous in that 
it can be formed with a smooth surface free of 
pits, grooves or machine marks that might damage 
the seal lips or interfere with a desired sealing 
action between the seal lips and the shaft. The  
 
wear sleeve prevents direct contact between the 
seal lip and shaft so that the shaft does not have 
to be formed with a precision surface. The 
components in a unitized seal assembly are packaged 
together so that the mated seal surfaces are 
located within the assembly so as to be protected 
against damage and contamination during the 
installation process. Axial forces are imposed on and between the 
inner and outer unitized seal cases as they are 
press-fit over a shaft and into a housing during 
seal installation. In many applications, the 
inner case and the outer case are further impacted 
together during shipping and handling. This may 
result in damage to the seal lips as they are 
axially abutted against the seal cases or wear 
sleeves. Installation forces also cause the inner and 
outer cases to be axially compacted together so 
that, during initial operation of the seal 
assembly, the relative rotary motions of the inner 
and outer cases cause the axially abutted cases to 
rub and abrade. Such rubbing can generate loose 
particles that can adversely affect future 
performance of the seal assembly and can increase 
the torque required to rotate the shaft about which 
the seal assembly is installed. A particular problem arises in the case of 
unitized seals which include seal lip elements 
formed from annular wafers of fluorinated resin 
polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).  
 These seal elements are particularly prone to 
damage from excessive contact forces applied by the 
seal case and/or wear sleeve during

An annular lip seal assembly (11), 
comprising: 


an outer annular case (13) insertable 
into an annular recess (55) in a housing (57); 
an inner annular wear sleeve (15) 
installable onto a shaft (45); 
said outer annular case comprising a 
radially outer axial wall (17) adapted to fit 

within the housing recess, and a radial wall (19) 
extending from said axial wall, said radial wall 

(19) defining a free end portion formed into an 
axially directed rim (21);

a first rigid, substantially non-deformable 

abutment structure (49) comprising a first radial 
flange (50) extending radially outwardly from the 

leading end of said tubular wall, and a second 
rigid, substantially non-deformable abutment 

structure comprising a second radial flange (25) 
extending radially outwardly f
rom the trailing end 
of said tubular wall, said second radial flange 

(25) being engageable with said axially directed 
rim (21) of said radial wall; 
a pair of annular sealing elements 
(23,31) connected to said radial wall (19) of said 

outer annular case (13) for sealing engagement with 
said tubular wall (43), one of said sealing

portion of said wear sleeve and the other of said  

 
sealing elements (23) extending toward said 

trailing end portion of said wear sleeve; 
said radial wall (19) of said outer 
annular case (13) having a portion thereof

wear sleeve are loosely interlocked prior to 
insertion into said recess in said housing; 
said first and second abutment structures 
(50,25) being axially spaced from each other so 

that said annular wear sleeve (15) can shift a 
limited axial distance relative to said outer 

annular case (13) to provide an axial clearance 
therebetween so that, during use, said radial wall 

(19) of said outer annular case (13) may avoid 
direct contact with said wear sleeve (15), and said
