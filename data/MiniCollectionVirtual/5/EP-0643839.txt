<ABSTRACT>
A method for estimating the biologic potential of prostate carcinoma in a patient is provided, comprising the steps of (a) obtaining a tissue sample of prostate carcinoma from a patient, and (b) quantifying the vascularity of the tissue sample, and therefrom estimating the biologic potential of the prostate carcinoma. Also provided is a method for estimating the biologic potential of a selected carcinoma in a patient, comprising the steps of (a) obtaining a biopsy specimen from a carcinoma by a method selected from the group consisting of needle biopsy, endoscopy, laproscopy, and cystoscopy, and (b) quantifying the vascularity of the biopsy specimen, and therefrom estimating biologic potential of the selected carcinoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the analysis of 
carcinomas, and more particularly, to methods for estimating the biologic 
potential of carcinomas, especially prostate carcinomas. Successful treatments for most types of cancer are readily available 
in the form of surgical and chemotherapeutic techniques which dramatically 
increase survival for patients who receive accurate and timely diagnoses. 
Unfortunately, even though a physician may be able to predict whether a patient's 
tumor is "benign" or "malignant," the reliability and significance of this prediction 
is uncertain. Most commonly, a diagnosis of malignancy depends on 
histopathological findings, determined by microscopic analysis of biopsies or other 
tissue samples taken from the patient. Histopathologic diagnosis of cancer 
presents a number of major drawbacks, not the least important of which are that: 
i) using currently available techniques, histopathologic assessment of tumor 
malignancy often requires relatively extensive tissue sampling, so that in many 
cases low-morbidity sampling techniques such as needle biopsy cannot be applied 
in a clinically useful manner; ii) histopathologic markers for malignancy are 
typically assessed qualitatively, leaving a wide margin for error and discrepancy 
between individual pathologists in evaluating samples; and iii) histopathologic 
markers for malignancy vary widely between different forms of cancer, making a 
standard method of analysis impracticable. Because of this situation, individual 
histopathologists may require special training to expertly diagnose specific forms 
of cancer, or may be poorly qualified for diagnosing a wide range of cancers. For 
most forms of cancer, the term malignancy actually embraces a broad spectrum of 
disease states, or so-called "grades" of malignancy. Different schools of teaching 
may apply different grading systems to the same form of cancer, while grading 
systems for different forms of cancer may be entirely incomparable. These 
circumstances add further uncertainty to the qualitative histopathologic diagnosis 
of cancer.  
 Even if methods for predicting tumor malignancy were considerably 
easier, and less risky and prone to error, cancer diagnostic methods would remain 
critically flawed since it is still unclear how tumor malignancy relates to the ability 
of a tumor to metastasize, or spread from its site of origin. Although it is generally 
accepted that a "benign" tumor poses little or no threat of metastasis, and that 
tumors of low and
