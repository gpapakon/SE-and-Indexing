<ABSTRACT>
After a programme position has been selected by means of the operating keypad, an identification signal for the vertical frequency of the transmitter which can be selected via the programme location selected is read out of a storage location allocated to the selected programme location of a nouvolatile memory and is supplied to an amplitude matching circuit. The circuit generates vertical deflection signals, the amplitudes of which are identical independently of the respective vertical frequency.

<CLAIMS>
Television receiver for the reception and reproduction
of television signals with different field

frequencies, comprising

an operating unit having programme location
selection keys,
an input circuit at whose output the
synchronization signals derived from the received

signal are available,
a microprocessor,
a deflection processor for generating horizontal-deflection
and vertical-deflection signals, and
an amplitude adjustment circuit to which the
vertical-deflection signals are fed and at whose

output vertical-deflection signals are available
whose amplitudes are identical regardless of the

respective field frequency,

characterized in that

it furthermore comprises a nonvolatile memory (5)
having a multiplicity of memory locations for

storing programme-location identification signals
for the field frequencies of the transmitters

assigned to the individual programme location
selection keys,
the microprocessor (3) initiates, after the
television receiver is first commissioned,

automatically or in response to a command entered
by means of the operating unit (1, 2) a

spontaneous transmitter programming of the
television receiver in which the field frequency

is measured for each transmitter detected by
means of a timer (4) and an identification signal

for the measured field frequency is stored at a
memory location of the nonvolatile memory (5)

assigned to the respective transmitter, and
the microprocessor (3) addresses, in response to
the actuation of a programme location selection

key, the memory location of the nonvolatile 
memory (5) assigned to the latter so that the

identification signal for the field frequency
associated with the respective programme location

selection key is read out of the nonvolatile
memory and is fed to the amplitude adjustment

circuit (10).
Television receiver according to Claim 1,

characterized in that, after actuation of a programme
location selection key, the microprocessor (3) checks

whether an identification signal for the field
frequency is already stored at the memory location of

the nonvolatile memory (5) assigned to the programme
location selection key or not and, if this is not the

case, the measurement of the field frequency is
initiated by means of the timer (4) and the storage of

an identification signal assigned to the measured
field frequency is controlled at the said memory

location.
