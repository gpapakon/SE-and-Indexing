<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 2-propanolamine 
derivatives and their pharmacologically acceptable salts, 
to a process for producing the same and to their use as 
hypotensive agents and antiglaucoma agents. It was heretofore known that 2-propanolamine 
derivatives, with their β-blocking activities or α,β-blocking 
activities, have been used as hypotensive agent 
and antiglaucoma agents. Nevertheless, these known compounds have turned out to 
be far from being satisfactory in terms of magnitude of 
such effects. Under these circumstances, the present 
inventors conducted repeatedly intensive investigation into 
novel compounds possessing more potent hypotensive and 
antiglaucoma activities, and as a result, found that 
1-(2-tert-butylphenoxy)-2-propanolamine derivatives, 
1-(2-tert-butyl-4-alkoxyphenoxy)-2-propanolamine 
derivatives and 1-(2-tert-butyl-4-alkylphenoxy)-2-propanolamine 
derivatives can achieve such objectives. In a first aspect, the present invention provides 
novel compounds represented by the following Formula IV: 
wherein
 
   R₁ is hydrogen, or a C₁-C₆ alkyl or C₁-C₆ alkoxy group;
 
   R₂ is an isopropylamino, tert-butylamino,
 
   2-(2-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-1-amino,
 
   4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl or
 
   4-piperonyl-1-piperazinyl group,
 
   provided that 
(i) when R₁ is hydrogen, R₂ is neither isopropylamino 
nor tert-butylamino, and (ii) when R₁ is methyl, R₂ is not isopropylamino 
and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof. In a second aspect, the invention provides a process 
for producing said compounds of Formula IV. In a third aspect, the invention provides compounds of 
Formula IV and those excluded by both provisos (i) and (ii) 
for use as hypotensive agents and the use of said compounds 
in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of 
hypertension. In a fourth aspect, the invention provides compounds 
of Formula IV and those excluded by proviso (i) for use as 
antiglaucoma agents and the use of said compounds in the 
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of glaucoma. In a fifth aspect, the invention provides 
pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula 
IV and those excluded by both provisos (i) and (ii) in a 
pharmacologically acceptable carrier or diluent. Referring to the above-described Formula IV, the alkyl 
group as represented by R₁ preferably is straight-chain or 
cyclic and has 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and there may be 
mentioned for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, 
cyclopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, sec-butyl,
