<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a static semiconductor memory 
device, and in particular, to a static semiconductor memory having a 
plurality of memory cells each of which includes a driving transistor 
formed of a bulk type MOS transistor and a load formed of a thin film 
transistor. Referring to Figure 1A, there is shown an equivalent circuit of one 
memory cell in a typical static semiconductor memory device in the prior 
art. The memory cell shown in Figure 1A includes a first inverter 
circuit composed of a P channel thin film transistor T₁ and an N channel 
MOS transistor T₂, and a second inverter circuit composed of a P channel 
thin film transistor T₃ and an N channel MOS transistor T₄. A flip flop is 
composed of a cross conjunction of these two inverter circuits, and the 
flipflop constitutes one memory cell. Data of "1" or "0" can be 
memorized in memory nodes N₁ and N₂ of this memory cell. N channel MOS transistor T₅ and T₆ are provided as a transmission 
gate used to write data to the memory cell and to read data from the  
 
memory cell. A gate electrode of each of these MOS transistors is 
connected to a word line WL, and one of source/drain regions of each of 
these MOS transistors is connected to a corresponding bit line BL, and the 
other source/drain region is connected to the corresponding memory node 
N₁ or N₂ of the memory cell. With a recent improved integration density, the load transistor 
(transistor T₁, T₃ in Figure 1A) of each of the pair of inverters 
constituting each one flipflop, is composed of a P channel thin film 
transistor, which is in turn located above a bulk type N channel MOS 
transistor (transistor T₂, T₄ of Figure 1A) which forms the driving 
transistor of the inverter. Referring to Figure 2, there is shown a diagrammatic layout pattern 
of the above mentioned memory cell circuit in a semiconductor integrated 
circuit device. In Figure 2, N⁺ type impurity regions 1a, 1b and 1c are selectively 
formed at a surface region of a P-type semiconductor substrate (not 
shown) made of for example silicon. These N⁺ type impurity regions 1a, 
1b and 1c constitute respective source/drain regions of the transistors T₆ 
and T₄ of Figure 1A. In addition, N⁺ type impurity regions 1d, 1e and 1f 
are also selectively formed at the surface region of the same P-type 
semiconductor substrate so as to respective constitute source/drain regions 
of the transistors T₅ and T₂. Respective gate electrodes 2a and 2b of the transistors T₄ and T₂ are 
formed of a first level polysilicon
