<ABSTRACT>
In a dynamic memory, a ground control circuit is provided for each 
one memory cell array, and includes a first ground control transistor 

connected between ground and a source of a grounding transistor in all 
selection read circuits associated to the corresponding memory cell array. 

A gate of the transistor is connected to receive a block selection signal 
which is brought into a selection level at a predetermined timing when the 

corresponding memory cell array includes a selected memory cell, so that 
the source of the grounding transistor in all the selection read circuits 

associated to the corresponding memory cell array are connected to the 
ground through the first ground control transistor. Two second ground 

control transistors having a current drive capacity smaller than that of the 
first ground control transistor, are connected in parallel to the first 

ground control transistor. A gate of the second ground control transistors 
is connected to receive a plurality of reset signals which are in common to 

the plurality of memory cell arrays and which are brought into an active 
level at different timings during a period excluding an active period of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dynamic memory, and more
specifically to a dynamic memory configured to transfer to a read-out
signal line a read-out signal received at a gate of a transistor selected by a
column selection signal in common to a plurality of memory cell arrays.In dynamic memories such as a dynamic random access memory
(DRAM), one means for speeding up the read-out operation is so
configured that, when a read-out data oil a bit line amplified by a sense
amplifier is transferred to an output amplifier in a next stage, the read-out
data is applied to a gate of a transistor, and then, transferred to the output
amplifier. This configuration is disclosed by, for example, Y. Nakagome,
et al., "An Experimental 1.5-V 64-Mb DRAM", IEEE Journal of Solid
State Circuits, Vol. 26, No.4, page 465-472, April 1991, and S. Mori, et
al., "A 45-ns 64-Mb DRAM with a Merged Match-Line Test
Architecture", IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. 26, No.11, page
1486-1492, November 1991.
This configuration will be called a "gate receiving read-out circuit"
hereinafter. With reference to Figure 1, one example of this type conventional
dynamic memory will be now described.This dynamic memory includes a plurality of memory cell arrays
(MCA1, MCA2, · · ·), each of which includes a plurality of dynamic
memory cells MC arranged in the form of a matrix having a plurality of
rows and a plurality of columns, and a plurality of bit lines (for example,
BL11 to BL16) each provided for each column of dynamic memory cells
MC, for transferring a signal from the selected memory cell. The
dynamic memory also includes a plurality of word lines (WL11, WL12, ·

memory cell arrays (MCA1, MCA2, · · ·), and activated at a
predetermined timing in accordance with activation control signals SAP
and SAN, so as to amplify a signal on a pair of bit lines.Furthermore, the dynamic memory includes a plurality of data

the sense amplifiers (SA11, SA12, · · ·, SA21, · · ·) and a corresponding
