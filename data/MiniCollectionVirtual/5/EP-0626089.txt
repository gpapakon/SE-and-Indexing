<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for teaching a language includes an audio visual medium for displaying a story on a screen in visual form accompanied by a sound track of said story in a language to be learned. A text is provided containing the story in written form with successive short segments of said story identified by means of sequential identifying indicia. The screen is provided with subtitles displaying each segment in written form in the language to be learned. Each of the subtitles is provided with sequential identifying indicia corresponding to those of the written text. Means are provided to start, stop, and reverse the audio visual medium to permit a user to locate and repeat a particular segment repeatedly as desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to language
teaching materials and procedures that utilize visual
and audio information, see for example WO-A-8 800 380, which discloses
an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method
according to the preamble of claim 7.Various audio and visual materials have been
utilized heretofore in an effort to supplement conventional
language teaching methods which typically entail
the use of a teacher who uses written materials.
Recently, sophisticated materials such as microprocessors
accessing random access memory devices in combination
with speech synthesizers have been proposed for
such purposes. See, for example, U.S. Patent No.
4,579,533. Other devices that have sometimes been
utilized are movies in which the audio portion is in
a language to be learned and subtitles are provided in
the speaker's native tongue. Such materials, however,
do not assist the student in learning to think in the
new language. Audio-visual materials have been heretofore
available for use in teaching of signing to
hearing impaired persons. See, for example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,879,210. The available materials, however,
are not in a form adapted to teach a language to a
person having a different native tongue. Although various materials and devices have
been heretofore available, a need has continued to
exist for materials which permit a student to imitate
the process by which a child learns language by associating
sound with images and/or actions. It is a
principal object of the present invention to provide
such improved materials. An important related object
is to provide such materials and processes which make
language learning more efficient and shorten the
length of time required to develop a command of a language.
A related object is to provide such materials
which will assist students who have a good command of
the written language and who are unable to either
speak the language or understand the spoken word to
develop both of the latter skills.A further object is to provide materials and
processes which can be utilized both as a training aid
for beginning or intermediate students to develop a
rudimentary knowledge of a language but which also can
be adapted for specific specialized uses for training
such persons as newscasters, business people, engineers
or doctors to develop a working knowledge of the
new language as it relates to their professions. A
still further object is to provide such materials
which are intellectually stimulating and can be provided
with a built in gauge of

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in teaching a language comprising an audio-visual medium
for displaying a story on a screen in visual form accompanied by audible sounds

generated by a sound-track of said story in the language to be learned and also for
displaying on the screen in written form in the language to be learned a transcription

of the of the words spoken in the sound-track of the story and means to start, stop
and reverse said audio-visual medium to permit a user to locate and repeat a

particular segment repeatedly as desired, characterised in that the transcription is
displayed on the screen in the form of sub-titles, the sub-titles including sequential

identifying indicia, and in that a separate text is provided in written form with
successive short segments of the story identified by sequential identifying indicia

corresponding to those provided in the sub-titles.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 further characterised in that the screen is a
television monitor.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 further characterised in that the audio-visual
materials are recorded on a video-cassette.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim further characterised in that the
story, sub-titles, and explanations of idioms and other explanatory materials are

displayed, on demand, on the screen, separately, simultaneously, sequentially or in
any chosen combination.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim further characterised the story
may also be selectively displayed with said indicia, but without any transcription in

said sub-titles.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim further characterised in that
idiomatic materials are highlighted, italicized or underscored.
A method for teaching a language comprising

providing an audio-visual medium including a screen, a loudspeaker, means
containing a recorded story, and means for playing a story from the recorded medium

to the screen and loudspeaker;
displaying a story on screen in a visual form accompanied by audible sounds
generated by a sound-track of the story in a language to be learned and 
displaying on the screen in written form in the language to be learned a
transcription of the of the words spoken in the sound-track of the story;

characterised in that
said transcription is displayed on the screen in the form of sub-titles including
sequential identifying indicia and in that
a separate text is provided in written form with successive short segments of
the story identified by sequential identifying indicia corresponding to those provided

in the sub-titles.
