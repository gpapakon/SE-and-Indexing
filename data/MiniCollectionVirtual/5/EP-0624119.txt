<ABSTRACT>
Smoothing mill for compressed ejectors (3, 4) of several stages, incorporated, for suction of dust generated and for conveying it through a flexible tube (19) to a collecting area, use being made of the compressed air discharged from the motor (40) which sets the abrasive disk (9) in rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns smoothing mills for finishing 
the surfaces of manufactured articles or for preparing 
such articles for subsequent treatment. Smoothing mills, particularly the disk type, are well-known 
tools and by means of an abrasive body, especially a rotating 
disk, are used for treating the surface of structures 
such as the body of a car, a piece of wooden furniture, flooring 
or thresholds of stone or wood, to obtain a good finish 
or to prepare the surface for further treatment such as 
painting. Special devices enable the dust, produced by the abrasive 
body on the surface to which said body is applied, to be 
sucked up and carried into chambers placed for the purpose, 
in order to keep the environment cleaner and healthier. Suction and damping down the dust produced by such work 
is an important aspect of the process. In one know model there is a fan fitted onto the motor shaft 
that rotates the plate-shaped part carrying the abrasive disk. The fan sucks up air and dust through a set of holes in the 
plate and in the abrasive disk and conveys it into a tube. Suction 
produced by the fan, moved by the same rotating shaft as that moving 
the abrasive disk, is in no way sufficient for the purpose. To overcome this insufficiency use is made of a separate self-propelled 
electric suction fan (of the bin-type  
 
vacuum cleaner) whose suction pipe is connected to the 
sanding machine. This system is made clumsy partly on 
account of the electric cable for feeding the suction 
system and partly because of its high consumption of 
energy. Another example is given by a fixed suction installation 
comprising one or more articulated arms carrying 
suction tubes that can be connected by couplings, at 
the ends of the arms, to a similar number of sanding machines. 
These fixed installations require high investments 
and maintenance costs are high as well. Connecting a sanding 
machine to an arm articulated on the installation also 
means limiting its movements and consumption of energy is 
even greater than that of a mobile suction unit.  
 The patent USA 3.824.745 discloses a disk type smoothing 
mill comprising a fan driven by a compressed air motor 
for suction of dust with abraded particles, and a device 
for making suction more powerful. Said device comprises a tube, placed axially in the duct 
for discharging air from the smoothing mill,that conveys 
air discharged by the compressed air motor directly from 
the outlet of the motor to a truncated-cone shaped head 
that opens inside
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Smoothing mill with an abrasive disk (9) supported 
by a first surface of a support plate (7) which is rotatably 

driven by a motor (40, 50), the other side of the support plate 
(7) forming one of the walls of a dust suction chamber 

(13), the smoothing 
mill further comprising a suction duct (16) communicating 

with the suction chamber (13) through an aperture (15) in 
the wall of the dust suction chamber (13) which is opposite 

to the support plate (7)
 
characterized in that, in the suction duct (16), one or 

more ejectors (3,4,5) are inserted, one (5) of the ejectors forming 
a continuation of the suction duct (16), each ejector being 

formed of an upstream truncated-cone shaped chamber (27,29,41) and a 
downstream cylindrical chamber (28,30,42) having an internal diameter 

equal to the lesser diameter of the upstream truncated-cone shaped 
chamber (28,30,42), the ejectors being placed partially 

one inside another coaxially to a nozzle (26) that 
introduces compressed air into the inner one (3) of said 

ejectors (3,4,5) to achieve progressively greater power 
of suction and capacity, in that the first surface of the support 

plate (7) is substantially annular and comprises radial 
grooves (8s) that extend from a central (10) zone to its 

periphery, and in that the central zone comprises apertures (7a) 
through which the dust suction chamber (13) is able to 

communicate with corresponding apertures (9a) in the abrasive disk 
(9), said abrasive disk 
(9) being held in place by a retaining 
part (11) having radial arms that compress said 

disk and bend it inside said radial grooves (8s), said 
grooves (8s) providing dust suction paths on the working surface of 

the abrasive disk (9) that will not become clogged up during the work 
even when the abrasive disk(9) is in contact with the working 

surface (10).  
 
Smoothing mill as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the motor (40) is a compressed air 

motor, the compressed air discharged by said motor (40) 
being used to feed the nozzle (26). 
Smoothing mill as in claim 1,
  
 

characterized in that the motor (40) is a compressed air 
motor, there being placed on the feed duct (17) of compressed 

air to the motor (40) a valve (20) with lever 
(21) to open and close the aperture for passage of fluid, 

comprising a shutter (22) whose position in relation to 
the valve (20) can be continuously adjusted by means of 

a ring nut (24) supported by said lever (21), it being 
thus possible, by adjusting rotation of the ring nut (24) 

to use said control lever (21) for determining the right 
amount of compressed air required for the different operations. 
Smoothing mill as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the motor (50) is an electric motor, 

the nozzle (26) being connected to a generator of 
compressed air by means of a flexible tube (53).
