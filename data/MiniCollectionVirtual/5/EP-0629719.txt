<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a silicon single crystal by 
the floating-zone method, comprising the steps of: providing 

a polysilicon rod(1) having an average grain length of 10 to 
1000 µm; heating a portion of the polysilicon rod(1) to form 

a molten zone(2) while applying a magnetic field of 300 to 
1000 gauss to the molten zone(2); and passing the molten 

zone(2) through the length of the polysilicon rod(1) thereby 
the polysilicon rod(1) is converted into a silicon single 

crystal ingot(4) through a one-pass zoning of the floating 
zone method. An apparatus for reducing the method into 

practice is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to high-purity 
silicon single crystal growth method and apparatus, 
and more particularly to a method of and an apparatus for 
producing a single crystal from a polysilicon rod by a one-pass 
zoning of the floating-zone (FZ) method. The FZ method and the Czochralski (CZ) method have 
been used as methods of growing single crystals of silicon. 
The FZ method, due to its capability of growing high purity 
silicon single crystals with little contamination of oxygen 
and others than ones grown by the CZ method, is particularly 
useful to produce high resistivity silicon single crystals 
for fabricating high-power semiconductor devices. In the production of a silicon single crystal by 
the FZ method, a polysilicon rod is used as a raw material. 
The polysilicon rod is produced from trichlorosilane deposited 
on a silicon core rod in vapor phase to such an extent 
that the grown polysilicon has an average grain length of 10 
to 1000 µm. To grow single crystal, one end of the polysilicon 
rod is shaped into a conical form and the tip of the 
conical end is melted and fused with a seed crystal. Then, the 
polysilicon rod and the seed crystal are united together 
while eliminating dislocations by forming a bottle neck. A 
silicon single crystal is grown by recrystallizing a molten 
silicon. The molten zone, formed by heating the polysilicon  
 
rod partially with an annular induction heating coil, is 
passed from the seeded end of the polysilicon rod to the 
other end by moving down the polysilicon rod and the grown 
single crystal simultaneosly relative to the induction 
heating coil, while rotating the polysilicon rod and the 
grown single crystal with a concentric or an eccentric mode.  
 A method for growing a silicon single crystal rod with 
applying a magnetic field to the molten zone is known from EP 
0 504 929 A1. According to said document a magnetic field 
forming means produces a magnetic field with an intensity of 
190 gauss to 600 gauss. Said magnetic field forming means is 
situated above and/or below the melting zone. EP 0 345 618 A2 teaches to use trichlorosilane to produce polycrystalline silicon having 
a grain size of 1,000 to 25,000 nm. What is to be taken from WO 86/04619 A1 is a ribbon-to-ribbon 
conversion system method and apparatus for 
converting silicon in ribbon form. In this case, the heating 
means is in the form of a laser beam in connection with a 
reflector. Said reflector serves for concentrating radiation 
energy in said beam to a
