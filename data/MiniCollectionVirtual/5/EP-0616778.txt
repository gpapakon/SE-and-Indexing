<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method for opacifying a reduced-fat food, 
employing a partially or fully debranched starch. This starch is prepared by 

enzymatic hydrolysis of the 
alpha
-1,6-D-glucosidic bonds of the starch, employing 
an endo-
alpha
-1,6-D-glucanohydrolase, such as pullulanase or isoamylase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing stable opaque clouds in 
fluids, employing partially debranched starch as a clouding agent. This 
invention also relates a method for opacifying reduced-fat food employing 
partially or fully debranched starch. As used herein, the term "opacity" refers to the amount of light 
transmittance of a solution or dispersion. As the solution or dispersion becomes 
cloudy, the opacity increases and the amount of light transmittance decreases. 
The solution or dispersion may be in liquid, solid or semi-solid form. When the amount of fat in a food is reduced, many of the organoleptically 
desirable traits of the food's full-fat equivalent are surrendered to a degree 
proportionate to the amount of fat reduction. Such desirable traits include 
mouthfeel, flavor richness and color or appearance. In particular, for foods 
having a creamy appearance (e.g., salad dressings) the removal of fat causes a 
loss of a desirable, opaque creamy color and appearance. In the art of clouding fluids, especially in an attempt to achieve the 
desired opacity or cloud inherent in natural juices, it is known and standard 
practice to form oil-in-water emulsions using edible oils. In bottled beverages 
the cloud typically has been provided by citrus oils for citrus flavored 
beverages, or by neutral vegetable oils (e.g. coconut oil) for non-citrus 
flavored beverages. This cloud may be enhanced by the presence of weighing oils 
in the beverage. In dry beverage mixes the cloud has been provided by 
incorporating spray-dried emulsions containing plastic fats, such as hydrogenated  
 
coconut oil, cocoa butter (U.S. Pat. No.-A-4,529,606) or triglycerides (U.S. Pat. 
Nos.-A-4,705,691 and -A-4,790,998), or hydrogenated coconut oil, inorganic 
pigments such as titanium dioxide, and hydrocolloids such as gum Arabic (U.S. 
Pat. No.-A-3,658,522). Similar emulsions have been used in liquid beverage 
systems (U.S. Pat. No.-A-4,479,971). A major drawback in the use of these clouds is the development of an 
undesirable soapy flavor which is due to oxidative rancidity and hydrolysis of 
the oil and fat. This problem is compounded because the soapy off-flavor 
develops during storage and may not be discovered until the product is sold. 
Development of this off-flavor in bottled and canned beverages may be due to 
factors such as heat and/or sunlight. In dry beverage mixes development of the 
off-flavor may be due to various factors, such as incomplete fixing of the fat 
initially, release of the fat

The method of Claim 1, wherein the starch is further modified by 
derivatization, conversion, or crosslinking or a combination thereof. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the starch is selected from the group 
consisting essentially of waxy maize starch, corn starch, high amylose corn 

starch, tapioca starch, potato starch, wheat starch, rice starch and waxy rice 
starch. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the reduced-fat food is formulated to mimic 
a full-fat food comprising an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the fully debranched starch is used to 
opacify a reduced-fat cream soup, in an amount up to 10% by weight, of the 

reduced-fat cream soup. 
The method of Claim 5, wherein the fully debranched starch is a high 
amylose corn starch and the cream soup is a retorted, canned soup.

opacify a reduced-fat salad dressing, in an amount up to 10% by weight, of the 

reduced-fat salad dressing. 
The method of Claim 7, wherein the fully debranched starch is a waxy maize 
starch or a high amylose corn starch, and the reduced-fat salad dressing is a 

pourable dressing or a spoonable dressing or a dry mix for reconstitution as a 
pourable dressing or a spoonable dressing. 
The method of Claim 8, wherein the reduced-fat salad dressing is a pourable 
dressing and the reduced fat salad dressing further comprises a stabilizer in an 

amount effective to prevent precipitation of the fully debranched starch from the 
reduced-fat salad dressing, up to 5%, by weight, of the reduced-fat salad 

dressing.

opacify a reduced-fat coffee creamer, in an amount up to 50%, by dry weight, of 

the reduced-fat coffee creamer. 
The method of Claim 10, wherein the fully debranched starch is a blend of 
debranched starches, comprising 30 to 70% of a fully debranched high amylose corn 

starch, which starch blend is dispersed in water, cooked to gelatinize the 
starch, debranched, blended with an inert carrier in a ratio of about 1:1, by 

weight, and spray-dried prior to formulating the reduced-fat coffee creamer.

A method for opacifying reduced-fat foods comprising formulating the 
reduced-fat food with an effective amount, from about 1 to 50%, by weight of the 

food, of a starch which starch has been partially debranched by treatment with 
an alpha-1,6-D-glucanohydrolase to yield at least 20%, by weight of the starch, 

short chain amylose.
