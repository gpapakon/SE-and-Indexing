<ABSTRACT>
Food cooking oven comprising a vertically hinged 
access door (1) provided with an exterior glazing (2), an 

inner door (3) arranged on the inner face of said door, 
wherein said inner door is provided with hinge means (4) 

along the hinging edge of the access door (1) to the oven 
housing and is able to be turned with respect to said 

hinge to a position which is moved away and separated 
from said access door. The oven further comprises a 

gutter (6) for collecting condensation water and further 
drippings, said gutter running along the lower edge of 

said access door, wherein said gutter is provided with a 
liquid shut-off means (7) and a liquid collecting element 

(11) is arranged so as to protrude from the lower side 
(10) of the oven cavity opening perimeter, in a position 

lying underneath said liquid shut-off means, the latter 
being normally shut when the oven door is open, and 

adapted to close automatically when the door is being 
closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an improvement in the 
arrangement for ensuring better cleaning of the inner 
door glass pane of a food cooking oven, in particular an 
oven for professional kitchens and similar catering 
applications, as well as for enhancing moisture removal 
from said inner door glass pane. It is widely known that in food cooking ovens, in 
particular when steam is being used as a cooking medium, 
the whole cooking cavity is filled with such steam. If a 
sufficiently low temperature prevails in the cooking 
cavity, the steam does not only condense on the food 
itself, but also on the interior walls of the cavity and, 
in particular, on the inner face of the front glazing of 
the door, which are therefore wetted copiously. When the oven door is closed regularly, steam 
condensate keeps collecting on the bottom of the cooking 
cavity, where appropriate conduits are provided to convey 
it outside the cooking cavity. When the door is then 
opened, the water that will have been formed by  
 
condensation inside the door starts dripping on the floor 
in an uncontrolled way, and this, as it may be easily be 
appreciated, not only constitutes a problem from a 
hygienic point of view, but also represents a risky 
situation, since a wet floor becomes slippery and, 
therefore, dangerous for personnel working nearby. From the disclosure in the US patent specification no. 
4,641,630 an arrangement is for instance known consisting 
in the provision, along the lower edge of the door, of a 
channel which extends all along the width of the same 
door and is provided, near the lower hinge thereof, with 
an outlet opening onto a condensate collecting gutter, 
said gutter being arranged externally of the door, along 
the lower edge thereof. Therefore, condensation water dripping off the door 
when this is openend, is collected by such a gutter and 
conveyed to the drain through such an opening, so that no 
water leakage takes place in the area where the oven is 
installed. In order to keep such a water collecting 
arrangement as compact as possible dimensionally, the 
outlet opening is aligned with the axis of the pivot of 
the door. Such an arrangement, albeit quite effective and 
simple, has however a main drawback. As a matter of fact, 
the outlet opening between said gutter and the underlying 
collecting channel situated beneath the lower edge of the 
oven cavity opening has the drawback of becoming quite 
easily obstructed either by solid or fat cooking residues 
and debris which are flushed off the
