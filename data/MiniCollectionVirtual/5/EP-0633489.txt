<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus, and an accompanying method, for use 
in a photographic camera for determining whether to 

utilize fill flash illumination in photographing a 
current scene. Specifically, fill flash illumination is 

used if both an initial value of the scene lighting 
contrast, based upon measured near primary and distant 

primary (or background) subject lighting levels, 
indicates that a distant primary or background subject is 

lighter than a near primary subject and use of fill flash 
illumination will reduce the scene lighting contast from 

its initial value. Fill flash illumination will be 
inhibited if the distant primary or background subject 

will not be adequately illuminated to generate a proper 
exposure thereof or if the near primary subject will be 

excessively illuminated relative to the distant primary 
or background subject so as to cause a reversal in the 

scene lighting contrast to occur. However, if an energy 
saving flash unit is being used, the output power of the 

flash can be appropriately reduced to a level sufficient 
to eliminate a reversal. Alternatively, a programmable 

shutter, if it is available, can be set to a different 
opening for a flash exposure than for an ambient exposure 

in order to prevent the scene lighting contrast from 
reversing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus, and 
various accompanying methods, for use in a photographic 
camera for improving the overall quality of photographed 
images, i.e. increasing the number of acceptable and 
higher quality images, that are produced by the camera. 
The quality improvement is attained by automatically 
selecting the values of various photographic exposure 
parameters (exposure settings and, where appropriate, 
flash parameters) based upon scene requirements 
(including providing sufficient depth-of-field and 
avoiding image blur) and film quality characteristics, 
and, where appropriate, deviating from the corresponding 
exposure values dictated by adherence to the ISO/ANSI 
exposure standards. Photographic cameras have been in widespread 
use for quite some time. Basically, such a camera 
operates by exposing a portion of a light sensitive 
media, i.e. a frame of film, for a pre-defined period of 
time to scene illumination. The light is focused on the 
frame through a lens that has an aperture of a given, 
often variable, size. A shutter, situated behind the lens 
and in front of the film, opens for a selected period of 
time in order to permit the light to transit 
therethrough, illuminate and expose the film. As a 
result of being properly exposed and subsequently  
 
developed, the film undergoes a photochemical process, on 
a two-dimensional basis throughout the frame, that 
locally varies the optical transmissivity of each portion 
of the frame in proportion to the amount of illumination 
that reaches that portion of the frame from a 
corresponding portion of the scene, thereby producing, 
depending upon whether reversal or negative film is used, 
either a two-dimensional positive or negative optical 
image of the scene. As such, tonal variations that 
appeared in the scene are captured in the frame of the 
film. Photographic prints are often made from negatives, 
while transparencies (commonly referred to as "slides") 
are made from positives. Though this overall process, which relies on 
the use of silver halide as a photosensitive reagent in 
film, has basically remained unchanged over many years, 
this process is highly non-linear and subject to a great 
many variables which significantly complicate its use. 
In particular, exposure (E) is defined, under a 
standardized definition, as being a product of the 
illuminance (I) multiplied by the time (t) during which 
the film is exposed to this illumination. In this 
regard, see specifically ANSI (American National 
Standards

Apparatus for capturing an image of a scene 
formed of a subject with near and distant subject 

elements, said apparatus having a flash unit (275) and an 
image sensing device, said apparatus comprising: 

   first means (200, 510) for determining an initial 
value of scene lighting contrast in response to measured 

near and distant subject light levels in said scene; 
   means (200, 520) for ascertaining whether fill flash 

illumination of the scene will reduce the value of the 
scene lighting contrast from the initial value thereof; 

   means (200, 530), responsive to said first

   utilizing, in response to said first determining and 

said ascertaining steps, fill flash illumination in 
capturing said image of the scene if the initial value of 

the scene lighting contrast indicates that said distant 
subject light level is greater by at least a pre-defined 

amount than said subject light level and if the scene 
lighting contrast will be reduced through use of fill
