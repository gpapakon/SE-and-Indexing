<ABSTRACT>
Bellows as protection of the junction between two vehicles which are connected to one another in an articulated fashion, there being a plurality of successive folds in the longitudinal direction of the bellows which form a tunnel which is enclosed all round, the two outer fold edges being held in each case by a fold in the frame and the fold walls which run obliquely inwards from the outer fold edges running together in an inner edge which can be the apex line of an arc, characterised in that the region of the inner edge (4) is distinguished in each junction region between one of the side walls of the bellows and the floor of the bellows by a securing seam (8, 9), in that this seam comprises two seam sections (8 and 9) which are spaced from one another in the longitudinal direction of the seam, and in that the junction between the floor of the bellows and the respective side wall of the bellows has been produced by pivoting the bellows material initially out of one plane into two planes which are perpendicular to one another, the region between the seam sections forming the pivot region so that the start (A) of one seam section (8) defines the floor and the start (B), which faces this first seam section, of the other seam section (9) defines the side wall, and that part of the side wall which is nearest to the floor of the bellows dips in a tongue shape into a pocket which is formed by the floor part nearest to the side wall of the bellows.

A communication bellows to protect the transition 
between two pivotally interconnected vehicles, a 

plurality of folds being disposed consecutively in the 
longitudinal direction of the bellows, which forms a 

peripherally closed tunnel, the two outer edges (2, 3) 
of each fold being mounted in a frame (12, 13) and the 

fold walls (5, 6), which extend inwardly at an angle 
from the outer edges (2, 3) of the folds, meeting at an 

inner edge (4), which may be the apical line of an 
arch, characterised in that the region of the inner 

edge (4) in each transition zone between one of the 
bellows side walls and the bellows base is 

characterised by a fixing seam (8, 9), in that this 
seam consists of two portions (8 and 9) spaced apart in 

the longitudinal direction of the seam, and in that the 
transition between the bellows base and each bellows 

side wall is formed by swinging the bellows material 
out of initially one plane into two planes at right 

angles to one another, the region between the seam 
portions forming the swing zone so that the start (A) 

of one seam portion (8) defines the base and the start 
(B) of the other seam portion (9) facing the first seam 

portion defines the side wall and the side wall part 
nearest the bellows base penetrates in the form of a 

tongue into a pocket formed by the base part nearest 
the bellows side wall. 
A communication bellows according to claim 1, 
chracterised by a distance between the seam portions 

(8, 9) and a dimension of the tongue-like penetration 
of the bellows side wall into the pocket of the bellows  

 
base such that the expansion of the side wall fold and 

the expansion of the base fold are identical. 
A communication bellows according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that on movement of the two bellows 

side walls relatively to one another about the bellows 
vertical axis and accompanying expansion of the folds 

of one bellows side wall (enlargement of the angle 
between the fold walls) and the contraction of the 

folds of the other bellows side wall (reduction of the 
angle between the fold walls) the tongue-like side wall 

parts roll in the pocket-shaped base parts. 
A communication bellows according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that before being swung 

into two planes at right angles to one another and in 
the flat state (angle between the fold walls is 180Â°) 

the material web is cut symmetrically between the seam 
portions from both fold side edges so as to be waisted. 
A communication bellows according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that each two adjacent 

bellows side wall edges of two consecutive folds are 
mounted in a common frame (12, 13).
