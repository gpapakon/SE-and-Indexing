<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a piezoelectric crystal element for acoustic surface-wave applications, having a quartz substrate (1) with at least one essentially planar quartz surface (1'), provision is made for the planar quartz surface (1') to have an epitaxially grown layer (2) of a crystal which is homoeotic with quartz and has empirical formula ABO4, A denoting Al or Ga and B denoting P or As, and for the quartz surface (1') and the epitaxial layer (2) to have approximately the same crystallographic orientation.
