<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for determining the association constant
between first and second binding pair members. In particular, the invention relates
to the use of magnetically attractable materials as the detectable label.Diagnostic assays have become an indispensable means for detecting analytes
in test samples by using the mutual reaction between the analyte and a specific
binding member, as typified by the immunoreaction between an antigen and the
antibody to that antigen. In detecting binding reactions, use has been made of
detectable tags or labels attached to antibodies, which in turn bind to the analytes of
interest. The detection of the resultant labeled antibody/analyte complex, or of the
labeled antibody which remains unbound, is used to indicate the presence or amount
of the analyte in the test sample.Two commonly used binding assay techniques are the radioimmunoassay
(RIA) and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA), both of which employ a labeled binding
member. The RIA uses a radioactive isotope as the traceable substance attached to a
binding member. Because the radioactive isotope can be detected in very small
amounts, it can be used to detect or quantitate small amounts of analyte. There are,
however, a number of substantial drawbacks associated with the RIA. These
drawbacks include the special facilities and extreme caution that are required in
handling radioactive materials, the high costs of such reagents and their unique
disposal requirements.The EIA uses an enzyme as the label attached to a binding member, and
enzymatic activity is used to detect the immunoreaction. While the EIA does not have
the same disadvantages as the RIA, EIA techniques typically require the addition of
substrate materials to elicit the detectable enzyme reaction. Enzyme substrates are
also often unstable and have to be prepared just prior to use or be stored under
refrigeration. In addition, enzyme labels may be difficult to purify and conjugate to
binding members, and may be unstable during storage at room temperature. Enzyme 
immunoassays are also unsatisfactory in that the methods typically require complex
incubations, multiple liquid additions and multiple wash steps.More recently, assay techniques using metallic sol particles as visual labels
have been developed. In these techniques, a metal (e.g., gold, silver, platinum), a
metal compound, or a nonmetallic substance coated with a metal or a metal compound
is used to form an aqueous dispersion of particles. Generally, the binding member to
be labeled is

<CLAIMS>
A method for measuring the association between a first and a second binding
member, comprising:


a) reacting said first and said second binding members thereby forming a
binding pair complex, wherein said first binding member is attached to a solid phase

and said second binding member is attached to a magnetically attractable label
thereby forming a magnetically-labeled reagent;
b ) applying and adjusting a magnetic field such that a force acts on said
magnetically-labeled reagent so as to dissociate said magnetically-labeled reagent

from said solid phase;
c) monitoring the dissociation of said magnetically-labeled reagent from said
solid phase; and
d) determining said force necessary to dissociate said binding pair complex, the
magnitude of said force being dependent upon the association between said first and

said second binding members.
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein said dissociation of said
magnetically-labeled reagent from said solid phase is monitored by a visual means.
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein said dissociation of said
magnetically-labeled reagent from said solid phase is monitored by determining the

resultant change in force exerted upon said solid phase.
A method for differentiating a specific association from a non-specific
association between a solid phase and a magnetically attractable label, wherein said

specific association is due to a specific binding between a first binding member
attached to said solid phase and a second binding member attached to a magnetically

attractable label in the form of a magnetically-labeled reagent, said method

comprising the steps of: 

a) reacting said first binding member attached to said solid phase and said
magnetically-labeled reagent thereby forming a binding pair complex;
b ) applying and adjusting a magnetic field such that a force acts on said
magnetically-labeled reagent so as to dissociate said magnetically-labeled reagent

from said solid phase;
c) monitoring dissociation of said magnetically-labeled reagent from said solid
phase;
d) reacting steps a), b) and c) in the presence of a free binding pair member not
attached to said solid phase whereby said free binding pair member inhibits the

formation of said binding pair complex; and
e) monitoring the difference in forces necessary to dissociate said magnetically-labeled
reagent from said solid phase in the absence and the presence of said free

binding pair member, said difference in forces being dependent upon said specific
association.

the same as said first binding member.
The method according to claim 4 wherein said free binding pair member is
the same as said second binding member.
