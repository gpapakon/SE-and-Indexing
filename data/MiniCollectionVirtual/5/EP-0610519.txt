<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agent containing, as an active
ingredient, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor such as
wortmannin and MS-444. The anti-HIV agent of the present
invention selectively inhibits the growth of HIV.HIV is the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS)-causing pathogenic virus. Helper T-cells are infected
with HIV, and the HIV proliferates in the infected helper T-cells
and destroys the cells, which brings about the cellular
immunodeficiency, resulting in the development of the symptoms
of AIDS.Azidothymidine (AZT) and interferon are known to be
an anti-HIV agent. AZT has an action of selectively
inhibiting reverse transcription in the life cycle of HIV
comprising adhesion, invasion, uncoating, reverse
transcription, integration, genetic transcription, protein
synthesis, modification, assembly and budding. However, AZT
has serious side effects, such as bone marrow suppression and
dysfunction of the digestive and nervous system. Interferon
is known to have an action of inhibiting budding of HIV.Wortmannin represented by the following formula:
 
is known for its anti-inflammatory action [Experientia, 30,
135, (1974)] and vasodilator action [J. Biol. Chem., 267, 2157
(1992), JP-A-3-215423].MS-444 represented by the following formula:

is known for its vasodilator action (WO93/09109).The present inventors have been interested in the
"budding" phase in the life cycle of HIV for the purpose of
selectively inhibiting metabolism of HIV without affecting
metabolism of hosts. As a result of intensive studies, it has
been found that a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor has an
action of suppressing budding of HIV to thereby inhibit the
growth of HIV.The present invention is directed to an anti-HIV
agent containing a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor as an
active ingredient.The myosin light chain kinase inhibitor as used
herein include wortmannin and MS-444.Wortmannin is obtained by culturing a fungus of
Penicilliumwortmannii in a medium to allow the fungus
to produce and accumulate wortmannin in the culture and
recovering the wortmannin therefrom [Trans. Brit. Mycol. Soc.,
40, 365 (1957), and J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I. 2898 (1972)].MS-444 is obtained by culturing a fungus of the
genus Micromonospora in a medium to allow the fungus to 
produce and accumulate MS-444 in the culture and recovering
the MS-444 therefrom (WO93/09109).Wortmannin and MS-444 were examined for the myosin
light chain kinase inhibiting activity and the anti-HIV
activity

The use according to Claim 1, wherein the
myosin light chain kinase inhibitor is selected from

wortmannin and MS-444 represented by the following formula.
