<ABSTRACT>
An Electronic Braking System for a vehicle having foundation brakes (137, 138) and a vehicle retarder (129), wherein an electrical braking demand signal (D) is generated from a single brake pedal and wherein the retarder (129) is operated variably or in small steps as the brake pedal movement is increased from zero, or rest, up to a partial point in its movement range which is calculated to give substantially the maximum retarder power based on the total mass of the vehicle such that for a full load condition this partial point occurs at low pedal deflection and, in an unladen condition where a given retarder will produce a higher deceleration, this point occurs at a higher pedal deflection, and in both cases pushing the pedal beyond the calculated partial point causes foundation braking to be commenced to supplement the retarder torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with 
increasing the efficiency of braking in vehicles 
fitted, in addition to wheel-mounted foundation 
brakes, with a transmission shaft or engine 
retarder and also fitted with an Electronic Braking 
System, sometimes known as a Brake-by-Wire System. Generally, vehicles are equipped with retarders 
in order to have the benefit of a form of dynamic 
supplemental braking means which is strong on 
endurance despite being of limited capacity and having 
an effectiveness which falls at low speeds. The use 
of such retarders saves foundation (friction) brake 
lining wear, particularly at low braking demands. The 
conventional practice is for retarders to be under 
separate control from the foundation brakes, usually 
from a driver-operated hand control. It is known from GB-A- 2 080 458 to provide an 
electronic braking system in which control of the 
foundation brakes and transmission shaft or engine 
retarder is co-ordinated in response to the braking 
demand signal. In the system of GB-A- 2 080 458, the 
retarder receives the full brake demand signal and is 
operated in an open loop, whereas the foundation 
friction brakes are operated in a closed loop and  
 
receive the deceleration error signal. A problem in 
practice with such a system, wherein the retarder 
receives full braking demand and a closed loop 
acceleration system is employed, is that, because of 
system delays and inherent lack of responsiveness in 
air brake actuation, system instability can be caused, 
particularly if wear, corrosion and poor maintenance 
cause hysteresis levels to increase. A further 
problem with the system of GB-A- 2 080 458 arises from 
closing the loop using deceleration signals which are 
inherently noisy, being derived by a differentiation 
process on signals which are subject to substantial 
load noise disturbances. This is because the 
filtering required to remove much of the noise 
generated, results in a slow deceleration signal not 
adequate for dealing with fast changes to braking 
demand which is required of road vehicles under 
critical circumstances.  
 It is known from EP-A- 0 469 280 to use 
preferential piloting of a vehicle retarder to reduce 
the wear and temperature effect of the friction 
brakes. The level of piloting is assessed according 
to a regulating algorithm stored in a control unit, 
details of which are not given. The retarder fitted 
to the vehicle is given preference to the driver's 
braking demand and at a high deceleration one or more 
friction

<CLAIMS>
An Electronic Braking System for a vehicle having 
foundation brakes and a vehicle retarder, wherein an 

electrical braking demand signal is generated from a 
single brake pedal and wherein the retarder is 

operated in a closed loop with measured retarder torque feedback, variably or in small 
steps as the pedal movement is increased from zero, or rest, up to a 

partial point in its movement range which is 
calculated to give substantially the maximum retarder 

power based upon the total mass of the vehicle, such 
that for a full load condition this partial point 

occurs at low pedal deflection and, in an unladen 
condition where a given retarder will produce a higher 

deceleration, this point occurs at a higher pedal 
deflection, and in both cases pushing the pedal beyond 

the calculated partial point causes foundation braking to be commenced in an 
open loop without deceleration feedback, to supplement the retarder torque. 
An integrated braking system as in claim 1, 
in which foundation braking is introduced at the front 

axle only and is increased with increasing pedal 
travel up to a point where the front axle braking 

effort is equal to the retarder braking effort at the 
rear axle with correction being made for the axle 

weight ratio so that the adhesion utilisation is equal 
between axles. 
A system as in claim 1, in which the retarder  
 

torque provides alone for low level braking and is 
supplemented by single axle foundation braking to an 

increasing level as speed falls when retarder output 
falls, in order to maintain vehicle deceleration from 

a constant brake pedal input. 
A system as in claim 3, wherein the retarder 
controller increases retarder drive to maintain a 

constant developed retarder torque until the retarder 
reaches maximum drive so that further fall in retarder 

effectiveness is accompanied by an increasing 
application of the foundation brakes to maintain the 

effective braking forces down to a virtual standstill. 
A system as in claim 1, in which at the first 
detection of a skid condition at an axle, preferably 

the drive axle, the retarder is switched off and an 
equivalent level of braking is applied to all vehicle 

axles as a friction braking substitute without any 
change in brake pedal position where if foundation 

braking was taking place when skidding was detected, 
the substitute component is added to existing braking 

pressures. 
A braking system as in claim 1, in which the 
retarder equipped truck tows a trailer and at all 

braking demand levels in excess of the check braking 
region, trailer braking is instituted whenever the 

retarder is substantially deployed.  
 
A braking system as in claim 1, in which an 
unladen truck tows a laden trailer and this condition 

is recognised by the system controller which disables 
the retarder only condition in favour of braking at 

all axles and at the trailer in unison, although the 
drive axle braking effort may still be provided by the 

retarder.
