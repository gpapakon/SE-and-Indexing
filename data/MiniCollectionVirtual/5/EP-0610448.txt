<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods for
selecting peptide ligands to receptor molecules of interest and,
more particularly, to methods for generating and screening large
peptide libraries for peptides with desired binding
characteristics.The isolation of ligands that bind biological receptors
is fundamental to understanding signal transduction and to
discovering new therapeutics. The ability to synthesize DNA
chemically has made possible the construction of extremely large
collections of nucleic acid and peptide sequences as potential
ligands. Recently developed methods allow efficient screening of
libraries for desired binding activities (see Pluckthun and Ge,
1991, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 30:296-298). For example, RNA
molecules with the ability to bind a particular protein (see
Tuerk and Gold, 1990, Science249:505-510) or a dye (see
Ellington and Szostak, 1990, Nature346:818-822) have been
selected by alternate rounds of affinity selection and PCR
amplification. A similar technique was used to determine the DNA
sequences that bound a human transcription factor (see Thiesen
and Bach, 1990, Nucl. Acids Res.18:3203-3209).Application of efficient screening techniques to
peptides requires the establishment of a physical or logical
connection between each peptide and the nucleic acid that encodes
the peptide. After rounds of affinity enrichment, such a
connection allows identification, usually by amplification and
sequencing, of the genetic material encoding interesting
peptides. Several phage based systems for screening proteins and
polypeptides have been described. The fusion phage approach of
Parmley and Smith, 1988, Gene73:305-318, can be used to screen
proteins. Others have described phage based systems in which the 
peptide is fused to the pIII coat protein of filamentous phage
(see Scott and Smith, 1990, science249:386-390; Devlin etal.,
1990, Science249:404-406; and Cwirla etal., 1990, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA87:6378-6382; each of which is incorporated herein
by reference).In these latter publications, the authors describe
expression of a peptide at the amino terminus of or internal to
the pIII protein. The connection between peptide and the genetic
material that encodes the peptide is established, because the
fusion protein is part of the capsid enclosing the phage genomic
DNA. Phage encoding peptide ligands for receptors of interest
can be isolated from libraries of greater than 108 peptides after
several rounds of affinity enrichment followed by phage growth.
