<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEIN KINASE C (IOTA)The present invention relates to a novel protein- compounds useful for the regulation of the activity of such protein, screening methods for identifying such compounds, the use of such protein and compounds in medicine, and to DNA sequences encoding the protein.Protein kinase C is the name given to a family of enzymes that contain a regulatory unit with a binding site for phospholipid or diacylglycerol and a catalytic unit containing an ATP binding site. Some members of the family also contain a Ca2+ binding site. The enzymes are important regulatory proteins in the signal transduction process by which the cells respond to signals received at cell surface receptors. Typically, protein kinase C is activated by diacylglycerol released from the action of phospholipase C on phosphatidylinositol (PIP2)- Binding of diacylglycerol to protein kinase C in the presence of ATP results in activation of the protein kinase C and it can then phosphorylate other enzymes involved in metabolic processes thereby regulating the metabolic processes. The specificity of the protein substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C is dependent on the particular isoform.Several isoforms of protein kinase C have already been identified and these have been given the subscripts alpha, beta, beta II, gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta. We have now identified a further, novel isoform of protein kinase C which differs from the zeta isoform chiefly in the a ino terminal region - a region believed to be important in the determination of substrate specificity. The novel protein kinase C of the present invention is named protein kinase C (iota) . The deduced amino acid sequence of the novel protein suggests that it is atypical protein kinase C which is most probably not activated by diacylglycerol derived from PIP2 â€¢ The mRNA encoding for the novel protein has been shown to be present in hamster 

insulinoma cells (HIT cells) and rat insulinoma cells (RIN) and also in isolated pancreatic islets from rats. Its presence in these cell lines and pancreatic islets suggests that it is involved in the regulation of the activity of hormones that originate in the pancreatic islets and are involved in the control of glycaemia, for example hormones such as insulin, glucagon and amylin. This is especially true of the capacity of glucose and other nutrients to stimulate the release of these hormones, since the nutrients generate diacylglycerol and other lipids, which might activate the novel protein, through pathways other than
