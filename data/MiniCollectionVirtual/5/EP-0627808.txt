<ABSTRACT>
The MOSFETs or IGBTs of respective arms of an 
electronic inverter are in series with SCRs or TRIACs triggered 

into conduction during intervals of intended conduction of the 
respective MOSFETs or IGBTs connected to the high level rectifier 

terminal. The piloting of the SCRs or TRIACs is effected from 
the piloting of the MOSFETs or with delay or in a conditional 

manner. The circuit eliminates the effective transience on the 
inverter output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piloting system for 
an electronic inverter and, more particularly, to an electronic 
inverter utilizing a bridge network of source-gate-drain 
semiconductors, especially field effect transistors and 
particularly MOSFETs or IGBTs, with improved piloting circuitry. Speed control in a synchronous electronic motors with 
alternating monophase and polyphase current used in modern 
equipment and automation is effected by varying the frequency of 
the supplied current. This variation can be obtained by 
inverters which are capable of converting the network voltage 
having a stable frequency (usually 50Hz or 60Hz), into a voltage 
with a continuously variable frequency which can range for 
example, from one Hz to several hundred Hz. Conventional inverters for this purpose used silicon 
controlled rectifiers (SCRs) which, however, have the problem 
that they are highly sensitive to transients in the network 
supply or generated in the inversion operation and which can 
cause destruction of fuses or overloads.  
 To avoid this problem, power transistors with analog 
modes of operation were substituted for the on/off switches 
constituted by SCRs. More recently, inverters, especially in large scale 
integration (LSI), have been provided with MOSFET transistors or 
IGBT transistors and significantly differ from the previous SCRs 
or power transistors in that they are devices which control the 
voltage rather than the current as characterized prior power 
transistors and the like. The MOSFETS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor 
Field Effect Transistors) and IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar 
Transistors) are field effect transistors which have source, 
drain and gate terminals and which can be used to control 
significant power with a minimum gate power. These devices can 
be considered to consist of two diodes having a common cathode or 
anode. Experience with MOSFETS, for example, in inverter 
circuits has shown that the MOSFETS are incapable of eliminating 
the problem of undesired switching due to transient parasitic 
voltages in the network with the danger that the electronic 
components will burn out, or the fuses will open circuit. In order to supply a given load with a variable 
frequency f with the availability of only one direct current 
voltage generator V, it is sufficient to switch the flow of 
current in the load with the frequency f. This commutation or switching must be performed with 
strictly constant time intervals so that the positive half wave
