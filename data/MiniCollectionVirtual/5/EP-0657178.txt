<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for making implant ceramic material, especially implant ceramic material containing hydroxylapatite. In the method according to the invention, the spongy regions of animal joints, preferably fully-grown cattle, are used for the production, the organic constituents of the spongy regions of the joints being removed by rapid burning, one or more flushings of remaining inorganic parts of the joint being carried out without chemical additives, and these inorganic parts of the joint being sintered. The implant material can be used in conjunction with the method of marrow inoculation and in cell cultures.

Method for producing ceramic implant materials, preferably
ceramic implant materials comprising hydroxyl

apatite, 
characterized by
 using, for
the production, the spongy parts of joints from animals,

preferably grown-up cattle, removing the organic constituents
of the spongy parts of the joints by a quick

burning, effecting one or more flushings of the remaining
inorganic parts of the joints without chemical additives

and sintering of said inorganic parts of the joints.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
by
 using, for the production, the metaphysary
or epiphysary spongy parts of the hip joint, knee joint,

shoulder joint or elbow joint of animals, preferably
cattle.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
by
 quickly heating parts of the joints
in cold condition, preferably frozen, to above the ignition

or inflammation temperature of said parts.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 effecting the burning at an excess
of oxygen and without the maximum temperature exceeding

the phase transformation temperature of the ceramic implant
material. 
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
in that
 the quick burning lasts from
a few seconds to a maximum of thirty minutes.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
in that
 the major part of the energy
demand is obtained from the burning or combustion heat

from the organic constituents.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 effecting an after-burning of the
generated exhaust gases, whereby the after-burning is

carried out catalytically and/or thermally and generated
waste heat is also used for process heating.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 optionally carrying out flushing
with water, whereby the ceramic implant material is

cleaned and easily dissolvable components of the material
are reduced and/or homogenized.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 optionally effecting as the last
flushing an impregnation with metallic salt solutions

for protection against bacteria.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 carrying through a classic ceramic
sintering, whereby the metals are bonded ceramically in

metallic salt solutions.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 optionally carrying out a flushing
with water, whereby a basicity value is set. 
Method according to any of claims 8-11, 
characterized
in that
 at least one flushing must be
carried out.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 effecting sintering of the inorganic
parts of the joints in accordance with classic ceramic

rules.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 depyrogenizing the ceramic implant
by a temperature treatment before compression thereof.
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized
by
 providing the ceramic implant with
an active substance or with combinations of active substances.
Use of an implant material according to any preceding
claim in connection with a mark inoculation method.
Use of an implant material according to any preceding
claim in cell cultures.
