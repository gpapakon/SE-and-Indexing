<ABSTRACT>
A medical information management system records 
patient's medical information onto an optical card (5) for 

management purposes. For each patient, any suitable 
information selected from among character, image and sound 

information is recorded onto the optical card (5) as 
medical information corresponding to the patient's morbid 

state. A read section (3, 4) optically reads out the 
medical information written on the optical card. A 

display section (23) visually presents the character and 
image information contained in the medical information 

that is read out by the read section. A reproduction 
section (13) audibly reproduces the sound information 

contained in the medical information that is also read 
out by the read section. Thus, a doctor can easily 

acquire or diagnose the patient's morbid state by 
listening to the patient's characteristic cardiac sounds, 

cardiac murmurs and breathing sounds, particularly to the 
cardiac murmurs if the patient has some circulatory 

disease. By also displaying the sound information as a 
sound waveform diagram at the same time, more accurate 

acquisition of the morbid state can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a medical
information management system which records a patient's
personal medical information onto an optical card for
various management purposes.Medical information management systems are popularly
known, in which various character and image information
such as characters, drawing, X-ray photograph and computer
tomogram (so-called CT) originally entered in patients'
case records (charts) as their personal medical
information are optically or magnetically recorded onto
recording media such as optical cards and magnetic disks.Because the medical image information, in general,
must be highly detailed and precise, recording, for
example, a single X-ray photograph as a piece of image
information usually requires a storage capacity of about
one megabyte. In addition, in order for a doctor to
obtain knowledge about or diagnose the morbid state of a 
given patient, image information corresponding to at least
three X-ray photographs would be necessary. This means
that a medium for recording the patient's medical
information must have storage capacity of more than three
megabytes.Nevertheless, the storage capacity of today's
commercially available optical cards is only about three
megabytes at the most, and thus, even if some form of
data compression technique etc. are employed, it is very
difficult or impossible for the optical cards to record
thereon more than image information about two or three X-ray
photographs and character information (and/or drawing
information) about the patient's personal identification,
clinical history, doctor's observation and the like.Further, in the case of a patient having a
circulatory disease, the doctor may more easily obtain
knowledge of or diagnose the morbid state of the patient
by listening to the patient's characteristic cardiac
sounds, cardiac murmurs etc., rather than by examining the
patient's X-ray photograph. However, since the prior
medical information management systems only express such
patient's cardiac sounds, cardiac murmurs etc. in
onomatopoeic words or in schematic diagram and then record
these as character and image information, it is very
difficult to promptly obtain knowledge about the patient's
morbid state just by examining the thus-recorded character 
or image information.EP 0 467 693 A3 discloses a medical information management system
for recording a patient's personal medical information onto
an optical memory card to manage the medical information. The
information management system comprises a read/write
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A medical information management system for recording a patient's
personal medical information onto an optical memory

medium (5) to manage the medical information, said optical
memory medium (5) being portable and used as the patient's

private memory medium, said medical information system comprising:

write means (3,4,6,11) for writing onto said memory medium
(5) any information selected from among character, image

and sound information corresponding to a morbid state of
the patient as the medical information,
read means (3,4) for optically reading out the medical information
written on said optical memory medium (5),
display means (23) for visually presenting the character
and image information of the medical information read out

by said read means, and
reproduction means (13) for audibly reproducing the sound
information of the medical information read out by said

read means (3,4),
wherein said write means (3,4) inserts at least part of

data of said sound information between data of the image
information to form composite data, so as to write the information

as the composite data onto said memory medium
(5), and
said read means (3,4) retrieves said composite data from
said memory medium (5) and reads out the sound and image

information separately by separating the at least part of 
data of at least the sound information and the data of the

image information from said composite data, and
wherein said write means (3,4) writes the at least part of
the sound information onto a predetermined part of a storage

area of said memory medium (5) provided for storing one
frame of the image information data, said predetermined

part of the storage area substantially corresponding to a peripheral
portion of the frame and being a part where no

substantially valid image information is stored.
A medical information management system as defined in claim
1 wherein said write means (3,4) further inserts at least

part of data of the character information between the data
of the image information to form said composite data, so as

to write the information as the composite data onto said
memory medium (5).
A medical information management system as defined in claim
2 wherein said write means (3,4) writes the at least part

of the character information onto a predetermined part of a
storage area of said memory medium (5) provided for storing

part of the storage area being a part where no substantially

valid image information is stored.
A medical information management system as defined in one
of claims 1-3 wherein said display means includes printer

means.
A medical information management system as defined in one
