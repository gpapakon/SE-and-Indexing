<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rapamycin derivatives,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such
derivatives, and their uses for inhibiting the growth
of pathogenic fungi, for inducing immunosuppression,
and for treating carcinogenic tumors.Rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrocyclic
triene antibiotic which can be produced by culturing an
organism in an aqueous nutrient medium. Its structure
may be illustrated as follows:
At least one rapamycin-producing strain of
Streptomyces hygroscopius was deposited with the
Northern Utilization and Research Division, Agricultural
Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Peoria, Illinois, U.S.A. under accession number NRRL
5491. Rapamycin, and methods for its preparation by
culturing NRRL 5491 are disclosed by U.S. Patent
3,929,992, issued December 30, 1975, the entire
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.This invention relates to novel rapamycin
derivatives of the formula:

wherein;
R1 is (H,OH);R2 is selected from the group consisting of
(H,H) and (H,OCH3);R3 is -H;R4 is (H,OH), and;R5 is -H;
   and all pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
hydrates or solvates thereof. This invention also relates to novel rapamycin
derivatives of formula II wherein;
R1 is (H,OH) ;R2 is =O;R3 and R4 are -C-C(CH3)2-O-, and;R5 is -H;
and all pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates or
solvates thereof;
and also to novel rapamycin derivatives of formula II
wherein;
R1 is (H,OH);R2 is =O;R3 and R4 are -C-C(O)-O-, and;R5 is -H;
and all pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates or
solvates thereof.This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising an effective amount of one or
more compounds of Formula II and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier or diluent.This invention also relates to the use of a compound of
Formula II for the manufacture of a medicament for use
in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic fungi in a human
or other animal.This invention also relates to the use of a compound of
Formula II for the manufacture of a medicament for use
in inducing immunosuppression in a human or other
animal.This invention also relates to the use of a compound of
Formula II for the manufacture of a medicament for use
in treating carcinogenic tumors in a human or other
animal.Still further, this invention relates to a
method of preparing novel compounds of Formula II
wherein R4 is (H,OH) and R1, R2, R3, and R5
are as described above, comprising contacting a
compound of the formula 

with a mixture of cerium trichloride and sodium
cyanoborohydride.
