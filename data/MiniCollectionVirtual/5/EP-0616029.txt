<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with bleach compositions 
(bleach additives) for use in conjunction with a detergent 
product (bleaching or non-bleaching) to enhance bleaching 
performance. The bleach compositions of the invention are 
especially intended for use as part of a Baukasten 
(building block) laundry detergent system. Laundry detergent systems of the Baukasten or building 
block-type are disclosed, for example, in EP 419 036A 
(Unilever): A main wash powder (or liquid) is supplied 
together with separately packaged additives, for example, 
water softener (builder) and bleach, that need only be used 
when the wash demands them. EP 427 314A (Unilever) discloses a stable and highly 
effective particulate bleach additive suitable for use in a 
Baukasten system. The bleach additive comprises sodium 
percarbonate, a bleach activator (preferably tetraacetyl 
ethylene diamine (TAED)), and an alkali metal bicarbonate, 
sesquicarbonate or dihydrogen orthophosphate. EP 458 397A, EP 458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever) 
disclose novel bleach catalysts which are transitional 
metal (manganese or iron) complexes. These catalysts are 
shown to enhance the bleaching power of sodium perborate 
monohydrate, both in the presence and absence of bleach 
activators such as TAED, in various detergent products. The persalt sodium percarbonate (sodium carbonate 
perhydrate) is more environmentally acceptable than sodium 
perborate, but it is substantially less stable. Not only is 
it unstable to moisture, but if together with a bleach 
activator in a concentrated environment such as a bleach  
 
additive, there is a danger of premature reaction between 
the two, leading to self-heating. The present invention is based on the discovery of a 
storage-stable and highly potent bleach composition 
comprising a bleach catalyst of the type just described, in 
conjunction with sodium percarbonate. The sodium 
percarbonate may be provided with a protective coating, but 
that is not essential. The present invention accordingly provides a particulate 
bleach composition for laundry use, comprising 
(a) sodium percarbonate, (b) optionally, a bleach activator, (c) a bleach catalyst comprising a source of Mn 
and/or Fe ions and a ligand which is a macrocyclic 
organic compound of formula I: 
 
wherein t is an integer from 2 to 3; s is an 
integer from 3 to 4, u is zero or one; and R¹, R² 
and R³ are each independently selected from H, alkyl 
and aryl, both optionally substituted. The invention further provides a laundry detergent
