<ABSTRACT>
In a first embodiment, a 
liquid hydrophobic phase comprising a core material and 

polyisocyanate at least partially soluble therein is 
emulsified with an aqueous continuous phase including a 

polyhydroxylated colloidal stabilizer to form a suspension 
of microdroplets of the hydrophobic phase. A polyamine 

such as diethylenetriamine reactive with the 
polyisocyanate and a catalytic amount of an alkaline base 

are then added, initiating an interfacial polyaddition 
reaction at alkaline pH which forms the polyurea 

microcapsules. The 
second embodiment is similar to the first, except that the 

alkaline base is added along with a surfactant having 
multiple S-containing substituent groups. Also, the 

colloidal stabilizer may be non-polyhydroxylated, such as 
polyvinylpyrrolidone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
microencapsulation of various materials by interfacial 
polyaddition. More particularly, it relates to a process 
for making polyurea microcapsule suspensions containing 
dye precursors usable for the production of pressure-sensitive 
carbonless copy paper. Pressure-sensitive carbonless copy paper (CCP) 
has been used for recording business transactions for a 
number of years. A simple modern form used for recording 
a transaction comprises plural stacked sheets, where the 
top sheet has a "transfer" coating on its underside 
comprising a large number of minute, evenly dispersed 
microcapsules. Each microcapsule is a spherical polymeric 
"shell" surrounding a droplet of a liquid "core material" 
such as a dye precursor solution. The lower sheet has a 
"developer" coating on its upper surface comprising a dye 
developer substance. When one makes inscriptive 
impressions of sufficient force on the upper surface of 
the top sheet, the microcapsules in the "transfer" coating 
beneath the impressions are ruptured and release their 
liquid contents which pass to the underlying "developer" 
coating. The "developer" coating converts the released 
dye precursor into a colored dye, thereby generating 
visible markings on the lower sheet corresponding to the 
original markings made on the top sheet. Some CCPs utilize microcapsules containing a 
colored dye instead of a colorless dye precursor, 
obviating the need for a "developer" coating. However, 
use of dyes in CCPs is currently disfavored because it is 
preferable that the coatings containing microcapsules be 
colorless. A coating containing a microencapsulated dye 
retains the color of the dye.  Some CCPs have both the microencapsulated dye 
precursor and the developer in a single coating, as 
disclosed, for example, in Dahm et al., U.S. Patent No. 
4,324,817. Microcapsules for various uses, including for 
making CCPs, can be formed by a polymerization reaction 
termed either "interfacial polyaddition" or "interfacial 
polycondensation," depending upon the polymer chemistry 
involved. Such processes are termed "interfacial" because 
the polymerization reaction that forms the microcapsule 
shell occurs at the interface between a first phase and a 
second phase, such as between two immiscible liquids. As 
currently practiced in the art, interfacial polymerization 
requires at least two separate monomers reactive at an 
interface to form a polymer: one at least partially 
soluble in the first phase but insoluble in the
