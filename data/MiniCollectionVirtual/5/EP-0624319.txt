<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cream for kitchen use which 
comprises an oil-in-water emulsion. This emulsion contains 

10-25% fat, which fat fraction comprises at least 50% 
monounsaturated fatty acids. The ratio of monounsaturated 

fatty acids (MUFAS) to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS) is 
greater than 5 and the ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFAS) 

to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS) is greater than or 
equal to 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cream for kitchen use, more in
particular a pasteurized or sterilized stable cream product
which can be used in the kitchen for preparing sauces, soups,
desserts or dressings, or as garnish. It must be possible for
the product to be heated, if so desired in use, without any
problem while maintaining its creamy character.In the prior art, products based on cream (milk fat) for
use in the kitchen are known. These products contain, in
addition to 20-50% milk fat (from cream), low-fat milk
constituents and, moreover, usually contain viscosity-regulating
products such as modified starch and the like, and
emulsifiers and stabilizers. The fatty acid proportions in
such known products can be characterized by a ratio of
saturated fatty acids (SFAS) to polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAS) of greater than 10 and a ratio of monounsaturated
fatty acids (MUFAS) to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS) of
greater than 5. The percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids
varies, depending on the feed regime of the lactating cow,
between 15 and a maximum of 50%. In an article of Lautsen in Confectionery Production, July
1985, 403-404, an 18%-fat coffee cream is described. In this
coffee cream a product named Confao 5, can be used. When using
this product, the 18%-fat coffee cream comprises 72% mono-unsaturated
fatty acids (MUFAS), 22% saturated fatty acids
(SFAS) and 6% poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS). 63% of the
MUFAS are formed by oleic acid.EP-A-0 469 656 describes non-dairy creams containing
liquid and hardened oils (15-75 wt.% of the fatty fraction). EP-A-0 459 562 describes a cream for kitchen use having
15-35% fat and a SFA/PUFAS ratio smaller than 4, preferably
smaller than 1, based on oils predominantly containing
polyunsaturated fatty acids, which oils, when unprocessed, are
characterized by a MUFAS/PUFAS ratio < 1. Because of its low
SFAS/PUFAS ratio, this product is said to be much healthier
than the above-described known products, while the product, in
spite of this low ratio, still possesses a good viscosity and
taste.For the preparation of the product according to
EP-A-0 459 562, hardened soya oil, a form of so-called "hard
stock" is used.According to generally known and applied principles, the
inclusion of a hard stock, i.e. a high-melting hardened fat
fraction, in addition to a low-melting unsaturated fat, is a 
technological condition for preparing an acceptable whippable
filled cream.Compared with cream for kitchen use based on milk fat, no
comparable melting range is reached
