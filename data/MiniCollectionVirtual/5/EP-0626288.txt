<CLAIMS>
Enveloping seat for a motor vehicle, comprising a 
seat bottom (10) with a cushion (11) supported by a 

framework (12) mounted on a base (14), a backrest (20) 
with a cushion (21) carried by a framework (22), and a 

joint (30) which connects the base (14) of the seat 
bottom (10) to the framework (22) of the backrest (20) 

to enable the cushion (21) of the backrest (20) to pivot 
about an axis (300) between a first, upright position 

and a second, folded-down position in which the cushion 
(21) of the backrest (20) is against the cushion (11) of 

the seat bottom (10), characterised in that the 
framework (12) of the cushion (11) of the seat bottom 

(10) is mounted on the base (14) via a plate (13) which 
rotates in such a manner that the cushion (11) of the 

seat bottom (10) can rotate about an axis (130), which 
is not parallel to the pivot axis (300) of the cushion 

(21) of the backrest (20), between a normal position and 
a rotated access position and in that the seat bottom 

and backrest cushions (11, 21) each comprise a median 
load-bearing surface (111, 211) and lateral beads (112, 

212) bordering thereon, and in that the median load-bearing 
surface (111) and the lateral beads (112) of the 

cushion (11) of the seat bottom (10) define a surface 
(110) which is joined to a complementary surface (210) 

defined by the median load-bearing surface (211) and the 
lateral beads (212) of the cushion (21) of the backrest 

(20) in such a way that, when the cushion (11) of the 
seat bottom (10) occupies its rotated access position 

and the cushion (21) of the backrest (20) occupies its 
second, folded-down position, the corresponding surfaces 

(110, 210) of the cushion (11) of the seat bottom (10) 
and of the cushion (21) of the backrest (20) fit at 

least partially one over the other. 
Seat according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises recoil means (40) to return the cushion (11)  

 
of the seat bottom (10) from its rotated access position 

to its normal position. 
Seat according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that it comprises a bolt (15) for immobilising the seat 

cushion (11) in its normal positon. 
Seat according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the joint (30) comprises a latch 

(321) for locking the cushion (21) of the backrest (20) 
in its first, upright position. 
Seat according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the bolt (15) and latch (321) are interconnected so 

that unlocking the latch (31) causes the bolt (15) to be 
released. 
Seat according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it comprises a control (50) which 

associates the frameworks (12, 22) of the seat bottom 
and backrest in such a way that pivoting the cushion 

(21) of the backrest (20) from its first, upright 
position into its second, folded-down 
position causes 
the cushion (11) of the seat bottom (10) to be rotated 

from its normal position into its rotated access 
position. 
Seat according to claim 6, in which the base (14) 
is provided with at least one slide (141, 142), 

characterised in that the control (50) acts on the slide 
to release it in order that it can slide, in particular, 

fully forward. 
Seat according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the slide (141, 142) is a slide which stores its 

selected position before being released.  
 
Seat according to claim 7, characterised in that it 
comprises abutments for holding the cushion (11) of the 

seat bottom (10) in its rotated access position, the 
cushion (21) of the backrest in its second, folded-down 

position and the slide (141, 142) in its fully forward 
position. 
Use of a seat according to any one of the preceding 
claims for equipping a land vehicle.
