<ABSTRACT>
Process for the purification of sewage by a biological route, in which at least one biological reaction is performed in at least one biological reactor containing microorganisms in activated sludge and the treated water and the activated sludge are separated in a clarifying tank with at least partial recirculation of the activated sludge to the said biological reactor, characterised in that, before the sewage to be treated is introduced into the said biological reactor, the suspended contaminating particles are at least partially separated from it, the separated contaminated particles are conveyed to a sludge activation reactor, separate and arranged in parallel, these separated contaminating particles are employed as principal substrate for the development of microorganisms under strictly aerobic conditions and the superactivated sludge thus obtained is injected into the biological reactor(s).

A method of purifying waste water biologically, in which at least 
one biological reaction is performed in at least one biological 

reactor containing at least microorganisms for treating the carbon 
pollution in activated sludge, and the treated water is separated 

from the activated sludge in a clarification basin, with at least 
part of the activated sludge being recirculated to said biological 

reactor, the method being characterized in that prior to inserting 
the waste water to be treated into said biological reactor, a 

fraction of the polluting particles in suspension therein are 
separated out therefrom, and the separated polluting particles are 

applied to a sludge superactivation reactor which is separated and 
disposed in parallel, said separated polluting particles are used as 

the main substrate for the development of nitrifying microorganisms 
in strict aerobiosis at a temperature of 25째C to 40째C, and the superactivated 

sludge obtained in this way is injected into at least one 
biological reactor in which a nitrification step takes place. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that a biological 
reactor is used in which the carbon pollution is oxidized and a 

nitrification step is performed. 
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that between the 
step of separating a fraction of the polluting particles and the 

biological reaction in the biological reactor, there is interposed a 
denitrification step in a denitrification reactor in which superactivated 

sludge obtained in the superactivation reactor is 
optionally injected. 
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
biological reactor is operated under alternating conditions of 

aerobiosis and of anaerobiosis. 
A method according to claim 3, characterized in that between the 
step of separating a fraction of the polluting particles and the 

denitrification step, there is interposed a biological dephosphating 
step in a biological dephosphating reactor in which superactivated  

 
sludge obtained from the superactivation reactor is optionally 

injected. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that, prior to separating out a fraction of the polluting particles 

from the water to be treated, a bioflocculation step is performed in 
a biosorption reactor by putting the water to be treated into contact 

with superactivated sludge coming from the superactivation reactor. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that between the step of separating a fraction of the polluting 

particles and the superactivation step, there is interposed a 
denitrification step in a denitrification reactor in which the superactivated 

sludge obtained in the superactivation reactor is injected. 
Waste water purification installations including at least a 
biological reactor (3, 4, 5) and a clarification basin (6) with ducts 

for recirculating activated sludge taken from the clarification basin 
to at least one biological reactor, characterized in that they 

include a phase separator (1), a reactor (2) for superactivation of 
separated sludge, which reactor is separate and disposed in parallel, 

in which nitrifying microorganisms are developed in strict aerobiosis 
and at a temperature in the range 25째C to 45째C, the nitrifying 

microorganisms being developed on polluting particles previously 
separated out from the waste water to be treated, ducts (C, C1, C2) 

also being provided to enable superactivated sludge taken from the 
superactivation reactor (2) to be fed at least to one biological 

reactor (3, 4, 5) where a nitrification step is performed.
