<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for generating an analog output 
signal representative of a digital input signal, which 

digital input signal is received as a plurality of bits. 
The apparatus includes a current branch array for 

establishing a plurality of output current branches and a 
reference current branch. The current branch array 

includes a first, a second, and a third electrical node. 
Each respective output current branch is responsive to a 

respective bit to switchably connect the respective output 
current branch intermediate the first and the second 

electrical node when the respective bit is a first state 
and to switchably connect the respective output current 

branch intermediate the first and the third electrical node 
when the respective bit is in a second state. Each 

respective output current branch and the reference current 
branch includes a respective switching device which 

responds to a switching signal to enable current flow 
through the first electrical node. The apparatus further 

includes a switching control device for controlling 
generation of the switching signal. The switching control 

device has a first input operatively connected with the 
second electrical node and a second input operatively 

connected with the reference current branch. The switching 
control device generates the switching signal and conveys 

the switching signal to each of the respective switching 
devices when the first input and the second input have a 

predetermined mutual relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus 
for generating an analog output signal representative of a 
digital input signal, which digital input signal is 
received by the apparatus as a plurality of bits conveyed 
by a plurality of bit paths. Parameter generating 
apparatuses, such as current mirrors, are often employed to 
provide a predetermined parameter to various portions of a 
device. Specifically, in digital-to-analog conversion 
apparatuses, current mirrors are often employed to generate 
a reference current and a plurality of output currents or 
characteristic currents in respective output current 
branches for providing analog signals responsive to 
respective digital hits comprising the received digital 
input signal. In newer circuit designs, a lower supply voltage, 
on the order of 3.0 volts or less, is employed. As a 
consequence, the digital-to-analog converter design 
techniques previously relied upon (which employed a higher 
supply voltage - on the order of 5.0 volts) can no longer 
be used. Current mirrors are generally not temperature 
stable. That is, the respective output or characteristic 
currents do not track with the reference currents as 
temperature changes, and the device is sensitive to a 
mismatch of threshold or trigger voltages of the various 
transistors employed therein for establishing the reference 
current and the output or characteristic currents.  One prior art solution to such temperature-related 
instability was to "stack" multiple current mirror 
devices, generally two high, in a manner such that a 
switching transistor in the first output stage effectively 
shields the switching transistor in the second output stage 
so that the source of the first stage transistor and the 
drain of the second stage transistor tracked together, 
thereby generating a temperature-stable output current in 
the second stage output transistor. However, the newer 
digital-to-analog converter designs which employ a lower 
supply voltage are not amenable to such a "stacked" device 
since the lower power supplied does not accommodate such 
multiple devices. There is, therefore, a need for a stable, more 
accurate digital-to-analog converter apparatus which can 
accommodate a lower supply voltage. We shall describe an apparatus for generating an 
analog output signal representative of a digital input 
signal, which digital input signal is received by the 
apparatus as a plurality of bits conveyed by a plurality of 
bit paths. The apparatus includes a current branch array
