<ABSTRACT>
A compact molded case circuit breaker 
operating mechanism crossbar assembly allows a 

unitary crossbar design to be used within a wide 
range of circuit breaker ampere ratings. A common 

phenolic crossbar (19) and a metal staple (21) are used for 
the higher ratings. An L-shaped filler (36) in 

combination with the crossbar and staple are used 
to adapt the crossbar to the staple for the lower 

ratings.

<DESCRIPTION>
Industrial-rated circuit breakers are 
available having operating components that are 
designed for automatic assembly to provide cost 
improvement as well as improved operating 
efficiency. The precision alignment performed by 
the automated assembly equipment allows the 
operating components within the circuit breaker 
operation mechanism to be installed within very 
close operating tolerances. The operating 
mechanism assembly includes a pair of powerful 
operating springs that are overcentered for rapidly 
driving the movable contact arm and the attached 
movable contact away from the stationary fixed 
contact to interrupt the circuit current. The 
operating mechanism includes a cradle operator 
which engages a latch assembly to prevent the 
movable contact arm from being driven to its open 
Position under the urgence of the charged operating 
springs. The compact latch assembly includes a 
primary and secondary latch operating within a 
common support structure. As described within U.S. Patent 5,089,795,the 
operating mechanism includes a crossbar unit that 
attaches the movable contact arm to the operating 
mechanism assembly. A force-resistant phenolic 
resin material having a solid steel core is used to 
fabricate the crossbar that connects the individual 
movable contact arms within the different poles in  
 
order that the contacts within each pole are opened 
and closed in unison. The metal staple and the 
crossbar vary in size to accommodate the various 
circuit breaker ampere ratings. It would be economically advantageous to have 
a common-sized crossbar assembly that will 
accommodate a large range of circuit breaker ampere 
ratings and facilitate the assembly of the circuit 
breaker operating components. One purpose of the invention is to provide a 
common crossbar assembly capable of being used 
within a large range of circuit breaker ampere 
ratings without deterring from the automatic 
assembly of the circuit breaker operating mechanism 
components. A common crossbar assembly allows the use of 
a standard size crossbar to be used over a wide 
range of circuit breaker ratings. To facilitate 
the use of a standard staple and movable contact 
arm carrier, an L-shaped insert is positioned on 
the crossbar prior to insertion of the crossbar 
within the staple. Figure 1 is a top perspective view of a 
molded case circuit breaker containing the crossbar 
assembly of the invention; Figure 2 is an enlarged side view of the 
circuit breaker of Figure 1 with part of the cover
