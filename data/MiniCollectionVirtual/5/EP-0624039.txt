<ABSTRACT>
A system is disclosed for delivering audio and/or video signals to users 
in connection with the provision of interactive television services. Various sources 

of such signals are connected to a digital network (10), such as a packet network. 
Also connected to such network are control (100) and application (102) processors 

and interfaces (112,114) to distribution arrangements such as cable television 
systems (116) and telephone subscriber loops (118). Each user has a signal 

converter (130,150) for receiving a digital signal from the distribution arrangement, 
converting such signal for viewing on a conventional television receiver (134) and 

transmitting control packets to other elements of the system. The signal sources can 
include a data cache (104) for storing recorded video and audio materials, a 

broadcast source (108) for receiving broadcast signals, apparatus (106) for 
composing multimedia signals from multiple sources, and apparatus (110) for 

running games. The various elements of the system can be situated at different 
geographical locations and operated by the control and/or application processors 

(100,102) under software control to provide a variety of interactive television 
services.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to interactive television systems, and more 
particularly to systems for providing a variety of interactive television services to 
users via distribution systems such as cable television systems or telephone 
networks. Cable television systems have made possible the transmission of many 
channels of television programs to the homes of subscribers. Instead of being limited 
to the number of VHF and UHF channels that can be transmitted and received in a 
given area, the number of channels in cable systems is limited only by the 
transmission characteristics of the cable itself and the ability to compress the 
information in television programs into narrower-bandwidth channels. The advent of 
fiber-optic transmission systems for use in cable television networks has also vastly 
increased the number of channels available. Such increase in channels has also given rise to proposals for interactive 
television systems wherein a subscriber can transmit information or requests back 
into the system, which information or requests may subsequently affect programs or 
information directed to such subscriber. There are a wide variety of applications for 
interactive television systems, such as video games, video catalog shopping, 
teaching systems, movies on demand and audio programs. Each application can be 
tailored for an individual subscriber, for example a subscriber may be able to select 
the language of the soundtrack in a movie. However, such systems typically require 
the ability (i) to control specific programs or information sent to each subscriber and 
(ii) to receive input messages or requests from the subscriber. A headend-to-subscriber channel does not need the full bandwidth of the 
usual television cable channel if compression can be used. For example, if a 
television signal is digitized and compressed in accordance with the MPEG standard. 
it is possible to transmit sixteen television programs digitally over a single 
conventional 6 Mhz cable channel. Other program information, such as high-fidelity 
audio, still video pictures or text can also be sent in compressed form. By using a 
large number of conventional channels for ITV purposes, such as is now possible 
with optical fiber distribution systems, together with compression, it is conceivable 
that hundreds of virtual channels could be made available.  Systems are also becoming available for transmitting compressed and 
encoded television signals over telephone circuits. In one such system, 1.5
