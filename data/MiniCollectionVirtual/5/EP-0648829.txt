<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for the 
gasification of an organic material which is characterized in 

that the molar ratio (H₂O/C) of the supplied steam to the 
carbon in the organic material is adjusted to a value of 1 to 

10 and the process is carried out so as to maintain a 
combustion or gasification temperature of 700 to 900°C, as well 

as a process for the gasification of glass fiber reinforced 
plastics which comprises the first step of heating a glass 

fiber reinforced plastic material to a temperature of 650 to 
750°C in the presence of oxygen and steam to gasify the plastic 

component thereof, and recovering the remaining glass fibers, 
and the second step of partially oxidizing the resulting 

plastic gas and recovering the CO and H₂ so produced or of 
burning the resulting plastic gas and recovering the heat so 

generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for burning or gasifying
an organic material through partial oxidation and thereby
producing an effectively utilizable gas.Conventionally, organic materials including wood, farm products
(such as sugarcane and corn), common plants (such as algae
and weeds) and the like have been gasified. Moreover,
techniques for the gasification of waste products consisting
largely of organic materials have recently been developed for
the purpose of processing industrial waste including plastics,
waste paper, so-called shredder dust obtained by crushing
plastics in scrapped automobiles, scrapped FRP boats composed
mainly of thermoset resin, and the like.Generally, conventional processes for the gasification of
such organic materials have been carried out in a single-stage
pyrolysis or combustion furnace of the moving bed or
fluidized bed type using air or oxygen and steam, for the
main purpose of recovering waste heat. Recently,
processes for thermally decomposing plastics-containing
waste in a single-stage pyrolysis furnace to recover
its oil content are also being developed.US-A-3 847 664 describes a process for removing organic
binder material from glass fibers, wherein the organic
binder is gasified by contacting it with a gas containing
oxygen and aqueous vapour at a temperature below the
incipient fusion temperature of the glass.EP-A-0 153 235 relates to a two-steps process for
gasifying an organic material, wherein in a first step
the organic material is contacted with oxygen and aqueous
vapour at a temperature of 700-800 °C, and in a second
step the gases produced in the first reactor are
converted at a temperature of 1300-1500 °C.Each of the above-described conventional processes involves
the following problems.(a) Plastics: Since a plurality of materials are mixed
together, the pyrolysis temperature varies widely from about
300°C to 800°C, thus making the operation difficult. Moreover, 
the formation of soot due to undecomposed carbon and the
deposition of coking products on the walls of the apparatus are
problematic. Furthermore, since the pyrolytically produced oil
has poor quality because of the inclusion of such undecomposed
carbon, it can only be used as a low-quality fuel oil. (b) Wood, farm products, common plants (e.g., algae and
weeds) and the like: About 40 to 60% of residual carbon is
formed. Moreover, the pyrolysis gas has a high CO2 content and
hence a low calorific value, it cannot be used as a fuel gas.(c) Shredder dust: This material involves the same
