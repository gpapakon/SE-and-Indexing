<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixing machine, in particular for producing mortar or paint, with a funnel-shaped supply container (3) for the powdery dry matter and with a conveying device (4) and mixing device (10) for discharging the dry matter from the supply container (3) whilst adding and mixing in water. In this arrangement, the conveying device (4) is arranged within the supply container (3), in the bottom region thereof, and is integral therewith. The mixing device (10) is arranged outside the supply container (3) on the latter. The supply container (3) has a lateral opening (9) into which the conveying device (4) opens and from which the mixing device (10) leads off.
