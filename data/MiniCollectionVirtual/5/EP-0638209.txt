<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cable grounding lead-through comprising a conductive support (1) and means (2, 3) attached to it for leading through and grounding cables (4), said means comprising at least two conductive plates (2) and a conductive gasket (3) disposed on both sides of each plate (2). The plates (2) are secured substantially perpendicularly and adjacently to the support (1) formed as a rail in such a manner that the gaskets (3) of each adjacent plate (2) are in close contact with each other, whereby the cables (4) to be led through can be inserted between adjacent gaskets (3) from the side opposite to the support (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cable grounding lead-through 
comprising a conductive support and means 
attached to it for leading through and grounding cables, 
said means comprising at least two conductive plates and 
a conductive gasket disposed on both sides of each 
plate, the plates being arranged adjacently to one 
another in such a manner that the gaskets of each 
adjacent plate are in close contact with each other. Such grounding lead-throughs are used in EMC-shielded 
devices, in which case cables are grounded 
through the support to the ground potential of the 
device, for example to the frame of the device. A grounding lead-through comprising superimposed 
earth plates with EMC gaskets is previously known, e.g. 
from US-A-3830954 on which the preamble to claim 1 is 
based. In this solution, cables are stripped at the 
gaskets and inserted between the gaskets of the superimposed 
plates, the gaskets being in contact with each 
other. The cabling is effected in layers from below 
upwards, and the superimposed plates are secured from 
both edges in the direction of the cables to the 
vertical side walls of the metal support by means of 
screws. Finally the structure obtained in this way is 
closed by a separate cover. The most serious drawback of the known grounding 
lead-through described above is that it is very 
difficult to do any changes to it. If the grounding must 
be changed, for example by grounding an additional 
cable, almost the whole construction must first be disassembled, 
i.e. the cover must be removed, the fixing 
screws of the plates must be opened, and a necessary 
number of plates with cables between them must be 
detached, and finally the same operations must be 
carried out in reverse order. The known lead-through is 
also disadvantageous itself owing to its complicated 
structure.  
 The primary object of the present invention is to remove 
the drawbacks of the known structure described above. 
This is achieved with a grounding lead-through of the 
invention, which is characterized in that the support is 
formed as a rail and the plates are secured 
substantially perpendicularly from only one edge to the 
support, whereby the cables to be led through and 
grounded can be inserted between adjacent gaskets from 
the side opposite to the support. The invention is based on the idea of securing 
the plates merely from one edge adjacently to a rail-like 
support formed in an appropriate manner, whereby 
the cables can simply be inserted between adjacent 
gaskets that are in contact

<CLAIMS>
A cable grounding lead-through comprising a 
conductive support (1) and means (2, 3) attached to it 

for leading through and grounding cables (4), said means

plate (2), the plates being arranged adjacently to one 

another in such a manner that the gaskets (3) of each 
adjacent plate (2) are in close contact with each other, 

characterized in that the support is formed as a rail 
and the plates (2) are secured substantially 

perpendicularly from only one edge to the support (1), 
whereby the cables (4) to be led through can be inserted 

between adjacent gaskets (3) from the side opposite to 
the support (1). 
A grounding lead-through according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the gasket (3) is formed of a 

piece which is cut from a flexible ribbon-like material 
and bent on both sides of the plate (2) around the edge 

of the plate (2) that is opposite to the rail (1). 
A grounding lead-through according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the support (1) is a profiled 

metal rail provided with openings (5) and gaps (6) which 

cooperate with an edge of each plate (2) and brackets 
(7) provided in it to effect the fixing of the plate 

(2). 
A grounding lead-through according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the ends of 

the plates (2) opposite to the support (1) are combined
