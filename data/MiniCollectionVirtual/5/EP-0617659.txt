<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a laminate comprising a thermoplastic film (A) that is provided with non-woven fibres that project from both sides of the film, a subsequent layer of thermoplastic material (B) being applied to one side of the film, the non-woven fibres not melting at the melting point of the thermoplastic material (B), and the non-woven fibres having at least partly penetrated into and been bonded into the thermoplastic material (B). Preferably, the non-woven fibres are synthetic fibres, optionally recycled from waste material, and the thermoplastic film (A) and the thermoplastic material (B) are of the same or virtually the same polymer composition consisting of polyolefine, more in particularly polyethylene, that has optionally been recycled from waste material. The invention also relates to a process for the manufacture of such a laminate in which at least a thermoplastic film (A) provided with non-woven fibres that project from both sides of the film is rolled and/or pressed onto a layer of thermoplastic material (B) at a temperature at which the fibres do not melt, the non-woven fibres at least partly penetrating into and being bonded into the thermoplastic material (B). Preferably, the thermoplastic film (A) provided with non-woven fibres that project from both sides of the film is rolled and/or pressed onto the plastic, hot mass during the production of the thermoplastic material (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a laminate comprising a 
thermoplastic film (A) that is provided with non-woven 
fibres that project from both sides of the film. In 
addition, the invention relates to a process for the 
manufacture of such a laminate. Such a laminate is known from GB-A-1489597, which 
discloses a thermoplastic film that is provided with a layer 
of non-woven synthetic fibres on one side. These synthetic 
fibres are responsible for anchoring the film to a concrete 
body. Bonding is achieved by applying the thermoplastic film 
with the layer of non-woven fibres to wet concrete and then 
allowing time for setting. A drawback of such a thermoplastic film is that it 
is generally too thin and cannot offer optimum protection to 
a substrate that is to be covered, for instance concrete. 
The adhesive strength of the thermoplastic film to the layer 
of non-woven synthetic fibres is low, so that the 
thermoplastic film can easily be pulled loose from the non-woven 
synthetic fibres when these are bonded to the concrete 
body. Another drawback is that the risk of the 
thermoplastic film being torn or damaged is high, for 
example when a substrate, such as concrete, that is covered 
with such a thermoplastic film is subjected to mechanical or 
physical loads. During placement of the concrete mixture, 
for example, the thermoplastic film may easily be damaged. 
This may occur especially when the needle vibrator touches 
the thermoplastic film during vibration of the concrete 
mixture on a vibrating table. A further drawback is that the thermoplastic film, 
when bonded to a substrate, cannot simply be provided with  
 
a relatively thick additional layer, for instance a second 
layer of thermoplastic material of a few mm thickness. 
Application of an additional layer of thermoplastic material 
will in this case have to take place by, for example, 
glueing. This gives a poor bond, and in the long run the 
additional layer of thermoplastic material will come loose 
from the film. The aim of the invention is to provide a laminate 
comprising a thermoplastic film (A) provided with non-woven 
fibres for covering a substrate, for instance a concrete 
body, which does not possess the above-mentioned drawbacks. According to the present invention this aim is 
achieved in that a subsequent layer of thermoplastic 
material (B) is applied to one side of the film, the non-woven 
fibres having been chosen such that they do not melt 
when the thermoplastic material (B) is applied, and the non-woven 
fibres at least
