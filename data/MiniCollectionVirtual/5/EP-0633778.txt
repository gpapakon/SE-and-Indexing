<DESCRIPTION>
 Medi cament for the treatment of ai rways i nfl ammation and ai rways hyperrespon si venessThis invention relates to a novel use, in particular a use for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of airways inflammation and, in particular, airways hyperresponsiveness.European Patent Application, Publication Number 314446 discloses certain benzopyran derivatives having smooth muscle relaxant activity.Airways smooth muscle relaxants play an important role in the management of asthma, but it is recognised that bronchodilatation alone does not beneficially influence two cardinal features of asthma: airways inflammation and an underlying airways hyperresponsiveness, which may or may not be a consequence of airways inflammation (Barnes, P.J., 1989, The New England Journal of Medicine, 321. 1517- 27, Smith, H., 1992, Clinical and Experimental Allergy, 22, 187-197).It has now surprisingly been discovered that the compounds of EP 314446 are potentially useful for reversing and preventing airways hyperresponsiveness, and for preventing lung cell damage associated with lung inflammation.It has further been shown that these compounds are especially potent in inhibiting the release of inflammatory neuropeptides, as evidenced by their potency in preventing bronchoconstriction resulting from stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic excitatory nerves. Moreover, these compounds have also been found to inhibit the release of inflammatory neuropeptides at doses that do not lower blood pressure.These compounds are therefore, potentially, of particular use as prophylactic, disease-modifying drugs in the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, such as reversible airways obstruction and especially asthma.Furthermore, whilst these compounds were previously disclosed to be relaxants of tension in normal airways smooth muscle, it is now discovered that they are especially effective in hyperresponsive tissue, thereby enhancing their value in diseases where the airways are hyperresponsive, such as asthma. Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula(I):(I) 

or, where appropriate, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein: one of A or A2 represents hydrogen and the other represents a group CF3-Y- wherein Y represents -CF2-, >C=O, or -CH(OH)-;Yl represents -O-, -CH2- or NR째 wherein R째 is hydrogen, alkyl or alkylcarbonyl; l and R2 independently represent hydrogen, or alkyl; or Rj and R2 together represent a C2-7
