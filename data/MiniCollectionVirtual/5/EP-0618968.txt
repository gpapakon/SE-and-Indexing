<DESCRIPTION>
The invention
relates to pharmaceutical compositions for the
treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
Additionally, the invention relates to methods for
testing drugs effective in dissolving Alzheimer paired helical
filaments or preventing the formation thereof.The brains of Alzheimer patients contain two characteristic
types of protein deposits, the plaques and the tangles.
These structures have been of peak importance in Alzheimer
research during the last few years (for a recent review see
Goederz et al., Current Opinion in Neurobiology 1 (1991),
441 to 447). A prominent component of the tangles are the
paired helical filaments (PHFs). It seems now clear that
the PHFs are largely made up of the microtubule-associated
protein tau which is normally attached to the neuronal 
microtubule network and, furthermore, particularly enriched
in the axons.There are six isoforms of tau in human brain that arise from
alternative splicing of a single gene. All these isoforms
also occur in PHFs (Goedert et al., Neuron 3 (1989), 519-526).
The main biochemical differences between normal and
Alzheimer PHF tau protein known so far may be summarized as
follows:
(1) PHF tau protein is, in contrast to normal tau protein,
highly insoluble which makes a biochemical analysis difficult;(2) PHF tau protein reacts with certain antibodies in a
phosphorylation dependent manner, suggesting a special
phosphorylation status (Grundke-Iqbal et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83 (1986), 4913-4917, Nukina et
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 (1987), 3415-3419);(3) PHF tau protein has a lower electrophoretic mobility in
SDS gels, suggesting a higher Mr value which may be related
to its phosphorylation pattern (Steiner et al.,
EMBO J. 9 (1990), 3539-3544);(4) PHF tau protein forms paired helical filaments with a
characteristic 78 nm crossover repeat (Crowther and
Wischik, EMBO J. 4 (1985), 3661-3665).Tau protein purified from brain has very little secondary
structure (as judged by CD spectroscopy), and a sedimentation
constant of 2.65, pointing to a highly asymmetric shape
(Cleveland et al., J. Mol. Biol. 1161 (1977), 227-247), in
agreement with electron microscopic data (Hirokawa et al.,
J. Cell. Biol. 107 (1988), 1449-1459). The C-terminal half
contains 3 or 4 internal repeats which are involved in
microtubule binding and promoting their assembly (hence 
"assembly domain"). This domain can be phosphorylated by
several protein kinases (Steiner et al., EMBO J. 9 (1990),
3539-3544), a point that may be significant in view of the
abnor
