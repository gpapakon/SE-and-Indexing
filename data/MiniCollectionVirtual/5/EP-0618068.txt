<ABSTRACT>
A laminated aircraft glazing having a high impact resistance 
for its weight comprises at least one structural glass ply (2,3) 

having at least one major face which has been subjected to an 
etching treatment and is protected within the laminate. Preferably 

the whole surface of the glass ply is etched and covered with a 
protective thermoplastic layer (2¹,3¹) after etching. The 

aircraft glazings preferably comprise two etched and protected 
structural glass plies, and may include an outer glass face ply 

(4) and/or an inner ply (5) of polymeric material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to aircraft glazings and, in 
particular, to laminated aircraft glazings comprising at least one 
structural glass ply which has been treated to increase its 
strength whereby it may be used to produce a glazing having a high 
impact resistance for its weight. Such glazings, i.e. glazings 
having a high impact resistance for their weight, are hereinafter 
referred to as "lightweight". Lightness is generally an important design criteria for 
aircraft glazing, as also is impact resistance and, in the case of 
pressurised aircraft, the ability to maintain a differential 
pressure between the pressurised interior of the aircraft and the 
exterior. Windshields for civil aircraft are also required to 
"fail safe" so that, even if one structural ply of the windshield 
should fail, the windscreen must remain safe under normal 
operating conditions and be capable of withstanding the pressure 
differentials to which the windshield may be subject under those 
conditions. The choice of materials for the construction of aircraft 
glazings is, of necessity, a compromise, since none of the 
available materials have all the required properties. Glass, 
acrylic or polycarbonate is generally used for the structural 
plies to provide the required impact resistance. Polycarbonate  
 
has a higher strength to weight ratio than glass, but is less 
durable, being more susceptible to surface scratching and to long 
term degradation i.e. physical ageing. Acrylic is more durable 
than polycarbonate and has a strength to weight ratio of the same 
order as known high strength glass. However its higher 
coefficient of thermal expansion impairs the reliability of the 
product when it is used in combination with glass (commonly used 
as the outer ply to ensure good durability), and its high price 
also militates against its use. The strength to weight of glass 
plies has been increased by thermal and chemical tempering 
techniques which have improved over the years; as a result, glass 
plies are today generally preferred to polycarbonate or acrylic 
for the structural plies of aircraft windshields for pressurised 
aircraft, at least for non-military applications. However, it 
remains desirable to increase the strength to weight ratio of 
glass still further to enable aircraft windshields with glass 
structural plies with even lighter design weights to be produced. It has previously been proposed, for example in Swiss patent 
specification 367 942 dated 1958 and US patent 3 711 263 dated 
1969, to enhance the
