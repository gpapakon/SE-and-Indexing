other, having respectively a face (8) for directing 
the flow of rising gas, whereby the reactor sections 

formed between the dividing elements (12, 13, 14, 
15, 38, 39, 49) form by means of the dividing 

elements (12, 13, 14, 15, 38, 39, 49) respective gas 
collection chambers (7) for collecting the gases 

rising from the ferment suspension and a 
sedimentation chamber (7) that is low in gas bubbles 

for the sedimentation of active biomass sludge 
particles and, feeding into each gas collection 

chamber (7), a pipe (10) with a throttle element in 
the form of a valve (11) for evacuating the gas and 

for adjusting the volume of biogas flowing into the 
reactor zone (6) above the respective dividing 

element (12, 13, 14, 15, 38, 39, 49), characterised

viding elements (12, 13, 14, 15, 38, 39, 
49) of the respective horizontal plane (53) directly 

thereover or thereunder and that the reactor zones 
(6) located above and below each of the dividing 

elements (12, 13, 14, 15, 38, 39, 49) are connected 
to each other by one opening only which is arranged 

respectively on the respective faces (8) of each 
dividing element that directs the flow to the  

 
respective gas collection chamber (7) and whereby 

the biogas flows out of the gas collection chamber 
(7) over the flow-directing face (8) into the 

reactor zone (6) located above the dividing element 
(12, 13, 14, 15, 38, 39, 49).
