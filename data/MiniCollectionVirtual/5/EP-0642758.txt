<ABSTRACT>
A suction attachment (1) for a vacuum cleaner (119), which suction 
attachment (1) has an underpressure chamber (7) with a suction opening (23, 25) and a 

discharge channel (9) for connection to a suction motor assembly (121) of the vacuum 
cleaner (119). In the underpressure chamber (7) there is an inner chamber (11) which 

comprises a spray member (73) for distributing a cleaning liquid over a surface to be 
cleaned. The spray member (73) comprises a distributor plate (79) which is positioned 

near an upper side (19) of the inner chamber (11) in a central position relative to an 
orifice (75) of the inner chamber (11). The distributor plate (79) extends parallel to the 

side walls (51, 53) of the inner chamber (11) and can be sprayed with the cleaning 
liquid from a spray nozzle (99). The use of the distributor plate (79) creates in the inner 

chamber (11) a plane, diverging liquid jet, so that the cleaning liquid is uniformly 
distributed over a major portion of the orifice (75) of the inner chamber (11) and the 

surface to be cleaned. 
The suction attachment (1) is used in a vacuum cleaner (119) which is 
fitted with a suction motor assembly (121) which can be connected to the discharge 

channel (9) of the underpressure chamber (7) of the suction attachment (1) 
via
 a liquid 
separator (131), and with a cleaning liquid reservoir (141) which can be connected 
via
 a 
liquid pump (143) to the feed channel (77) of the inner chamber (11) of the suction 

attachment (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a suction attachment for a vacuum cleaner, which 
suction attachment is provided with an underpressure chamber which comprises a 
suction opening and a discharge channel for connection to a suction motor assembly, 
and an inner chamber arranged inside the underpressure chamber and comprising a feed 
channel for cleaning liquid and a spray member for distributing the cleaning liquid over 
an orifice of the inner chamber extending adjacent the suction opening. The invention also relates to a spray member suitable for use in a suction 
attachment according to the invention. The invention also relates to a vacuum cleaner which has a suction 
attachment according to the invention. A suction attachment of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is 
known from European Patent 0 316 849. The known suction attachment has an elongate 
underpressure chamber and a inner chamber which is also elongate and which extends 
through a central plane of the underpressure chamber, the suction opening of the 
underpressure chamber and the orifice of the inner chamber extending in one plane. The 
spray member of the known suction attachment has a distributor chamber for the 
cleaning liquid positioned inside the inner chamber, the feed channel for the cleaning 
liquid issuing into this distributor chamber. The distributor chamber is bounded by a T-shaped 
closing strip which extends parallel to the suction opening and whose cheeks are 
provided with a regular pattern of incisions. The distributor chamber is filled with the 
cleaning liquid through the feed channel. When the distributor chamber is substantially 
full, a continuous and sufficient flow of the cleaning liquid takes place through the 
incisions of the closing strip ad the orifice of the inner chamber towards a surface to 
be cleaned under the influence of a liquid pressure built up in the distributor chamber. 
The cleaning liquid is distributed substantially uniformly over the orifice of the inner 
chamber and the surface to be cleaned owing to the use of the said closing strip.  A disadvantage of the known suction attachment is that a continuous and 
sufficient flow of the cleaning liquid is achieved only when the distributor chamber of 
the spray member is substantially full. Owing to the presence of the cleaning liquid in 
the distributor chamber, the weight to be lifted by a user during moving of the suction 
attachment and the pushing force to be exerted by the user on the suction attachment 
during shifting of the suction

<CLAIMS>
A suction attachment for a vacuum cleaner, which suction attachment is 
provided with a underpressure chamber which comprises a suction opening and a 

discharge channel for connection to a suction motor assembly, and a inner chamber 
arranged inside the underpressure chamber and comprising a feed channel for cleaning 

liquid and a spray member for distributing the cleaning liquid over a orifice of the 
inner chamber extending adjacent the suction opening, characterized in that the spray 

member comprises a distributor plate which extends substantially parallel to a side wall 
of the inner chamber, which is positioned centrally relative to the orifice of the inner 

chamber adjacent a upper side of the inner chamber, and which is sprayable with the 
cleaning liquid from a spray nozzle which is in connection with the feed channel. 
A suction attachment as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the 
distributor plate is semicircular, while a spray contact point of the distributor plate is 

situated adjacent a circle centre of the distributor plate. 
A suction attachment as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
spray nozzle is in connection with the feed channel through a transverse channel which 

extends transversely to the feed channel. 
A suction attachment as claimed in Claims 2 and 3, characterized in that 
the transverse channel merges near the spray nozzle into a guide surface which extends 

parallel to the transverse channel and which is connected to the distributor plate via a 
curved portion near the circle centre of the distributor plate. 
A suction attachment as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the 
feed channel, the transverse channel and the distributor plat
e form an integrally 
manufactured component which is detachably fastened to the upper side of the inner 

chamber. 
A suction attachment as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the 
transverse channel is bounded by a recess of semicircular cross-section which is 

provided in said component and by a flat wall provided near the upper side of the inner 
chamber. 
A suction attachment as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the inner chamber has two triangular side walls extending 

substantially parallel to the distributor plate, the distributor plate being arranged 
adjacent the apex angles of the two triangles, while the orifice of the inner chamber 

extends between the bases of the two triangles. 
A spray member suitable for use in a suction attachment as claimed in any 
one of the Claims 1 to 6.
