<ABSTRACT>
Aquarium consisting of a structure which is filled with water to form a rigid casing (1). The upper casing is open, its lateral walls being capable of supporting water pressure and co-operating with sealing means in order to define a sealed water chamber. The aquarium is characterized in that the sealing means are independently formed from the rigid casing (1) and consist of, at least partially, a removable flexible impermeable lining (3) which is foldable over itself on the same plane, the deployed shape largely corresponding to the shape of the inner volume of the rigid casing (1). Consequently, the latter has a support function only. The casing accommodates the lining (3), which is deployed once the aquarium is installed, the water pressure during fitting of the lining serving to press the lining (3) against the casing's side walls.
