<ABSTRACT>
A titanium dioxide production method comprising (a) 
forming a mixture comprising an agglomerated titanium 

dioxide material in a liquid medium; (b) wet milling the 
agglomerated titanium dioxide material in the liquid 

medium; (c) reducing the pH to a value not exceeding 4.0; 
(d) adding an effective amount of a base to the mixture to 

cause the titanium dioxide material to flocculate; 
(e) removing the titanium dioxide material from the 

mixture; and (f) washing the titanium dioxide material. 
The agglomerated titanium dioxide material in (a) is 

produced by a reaction process and has deposited thereon 
substantially no inorganic oxides other than any inorganic 

oxides formed in the reaction process. The titanium 
dioxide material obtained is readily dispersed in plastics.

<DESCRIPTION>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to
methods of producing titanium dioxide and to titanium
dioxide products produced by such methods. In another
aspect, the present invention relates to processes for
producing plastic products containing titanium dioxide
and to plastic products formed by such processes.Pigmentary titanium dioxide materials are widely
used as coloring agents in plastics, paints, inks,
papers, and in many other materials. In plastics,
pigmentary titanium dioxides impart color and provide
UV protection. The UV protection provided by the
incorporation of titanium dioxide can substantially
improve the durability of a plastic material.A need presently exists for titanium dioxide
materials which are more readily dispersed in plastics.
In order to reduce the weight and cost of plastic film
products, for example, the plastics industry is seeking
ways to reduce the thickness of plastic film products
while maintaining the strength and integrity of such
products. The dispersibility of the pigmentary
materials used in such applications becomes more
significant as film thickness decreases. When a
titanium dioxide pigment is inadequately dispersed in a
plastic film product, the presence of agglomerated
masses of undispersed pigment material (i.e., nibs) can
destroy the utility of the plastic film. Additionally,
undispersed pigment material can stick to process
rollers and/or die parts and thereby produce holes,
rips, and/or tears in the plastic film product.
Further, poorly dispersed pigment materials can quickly
clog polishing screens and other such devices used in
film forming processes. Titanium dioxides are generally produced in two
crystalline forms, anatase and rutile. Rutile titanium
dioxide is commonly produced from titanium halides
(preferably titanium tetrachloride) using vapor phase
oxidation processes. Examples of vapor phase oxidation
processes are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,208,866 and
3,512,219. The entire disclosures of these patents are
incorporated herein by reference.In a vapor phase oxidation process, a titanium
halide vapor reactant is oxidized using an oxygen-containing
gas such as molecular oxygen, air, or oxygen
enriched air. Various particle size control agents
and/or rutilization agents are commonly added to the
vapor phase oxidation system. Water vapor is commonly
added, for example, to control nucleation and,
therefore, product particle size. Aluminum chloride is
commonly added in order to stabilize the crystalline
matrix of the titanium dioxide product material
