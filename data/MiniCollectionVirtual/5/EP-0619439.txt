<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is to mount the sintered friction elements (1) on elastic steel plates (2), at the ends of the latter, which are secured by means of spacers on the carrier plate (3), with the result that each plate end acts as a tongue capable of independent movement and is thus capable of accommodating the deformations due to thermal stresses, uniform pressure of the friction elements on the brake disc thereby being achieved.

<CLAIMS>
Disc brake lining consisting of a metal support plate (3), at 
which sinter elements friction (1) bearing metal plates (2) are fastened, 

characterized by that the friction elements (1) are fastened in small units 
on the end portions of the metal plates (2), which are elastically 

deformable at high temperatures and the metal plates are spaced and 
secured to the support plate (3) by fastening bolts (5,6), so that the 

friction elements (1) lie at freely movable projection ends of the steel plate 
(2). 
Disc brake lining according to claim 1, characterized in that 
two or three friction elements (1) are fastened on the metal plates (2). 
Disc brake lining according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the friction elements are riveted on the steel plate (2) with their own 

metal supports. 
Disc brake lining according to claim 3, characterized in that a 
temperature resisting isolation and damping layer is arranged between 

the steel plates (2) and the support plate (3). 
Disc brake lining according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the metal plates (2) are provided with apertures (9,10) extending from the 

centre and/or edge in direction of the fastening bolts (5,6) and divide the 
metal plate (2) into tongues, which are connected to one another and 

movable independently from one another. 
Disc brake lining according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that an isolating and damping layer an isolating and 

damping layer is arranged between the friction elements (1) and 
respective metal plates (2). 
Disc brake lining according to claims 4 and 6, characterized 
in that the said isolating and damping layer consists of a tridimensional 

fiber unit bound by an organic binder. 
Disc brake lining according to claims 1-7, characterized in 
that the metal plates (2) are removable fastened on the support plate.  

 
Disc brake lining according to claim 8, characterized in that 
for fastening the plates (2) on the support plate (3) there is riveted a 

suitable perforated spacer (7) and a peripheral slot is provided therein, in 
that on the plate (2) there are riveted fastening bolts (6), on the surfaces 

of which also a periphered slot is provided, so that at the assemblage with 
said spacer said fastening bolts (6) are pressed, by inserting heat 

resisting elastic rings, into the seat formed by said opposite slots.
