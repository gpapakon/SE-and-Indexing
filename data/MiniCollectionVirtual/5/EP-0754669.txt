<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
an α -halo ketone from a carboxylic acid derivative or ester
utilizing an α -haloacetic acid, a process for producing an
α -halohydrin by reducing the α -halo ketone so produced, and
a process for producing an epoxide by reducing the
α -halohydrin so produced.More particularly, the present invention relates to a
technology for producing aminohalo ketones, aminohalohydrins
and aminoepoxides from amino acid derivatives or amino acid
esters and particulary to a technology for producing optically
active α -halo ketones, α -halohydrins and epoxides from the
corresponding optically active amino-protected phenylalanine
esters. α -Halo ketones, α -halohydrins and epoxides
originating from optically active phenylalanine are compounds
of value as intermediates for the production of medicines.The following processes are known for the production of
aminohalo ketones.
(1) A process for producing a chloroketone or an
aminochloroketone which comprises converting an amino-protected
amino acid to a mixed acid anhydride, reacting the
anhydride with diazomethane to give an amino diazoketone and
treating the ketone with hydrochloric acid (Siegfried Fittkau
et al., Journal fur Praktische Chemie, 529, 1986).(2) A process for producing an aminochloroketone which
comprises converting an amino-protected amino acid to a mixed
acid anhydride, reacting the anhydride with diazomethane to
give an aminodiazoketone, and treating the ketone with a metal
chloride (Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-5-117169).(3) A process for producing a chloroketone or an 
aminochloroketone which comprises reacting an amino-protected
amino acid ester with a halomethyllithium (J. Chem. Soc. Chem.
Commun., 969, 1994).(4) A process for producing a chloroketone by performing a condensation reaction
of 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone with acetic acid and split the indermediate product
trifluoroacetic acid ethyl ester catalysed by acid (reaction cited in EP-A-0 470
462).
As the production technology for aminohalohydrins and
aminoepoxides, the following processes are known.(5) A process comprising reducing an α -chloroketone as
typically obtained by the above process (1) or (2) to a
α -halohydrin using a reducing agent such as sodium
borohydride and a process comprising treating said
α -halohydrin further with a base to give the corresponding
epoxide (Tetrahedron, 50, 6333, 1994; J. Medic. Chem., 37,
1758, 1994; J. Medic. Chem., 34, 1221, 1991).(6) A process comprising permitting sulfoniumylide to act on
