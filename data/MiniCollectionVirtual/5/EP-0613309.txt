<ABSTRACT>
The present invention legalizes a video signal 
(e.g., 4:2:2 format) being processed in one format 

so that the video signal can be transformed to other 
formats (e.g., analog composite NTSC format). An 

editor can be notified of color legalities in a 
video signal. Further, each pixel of a video signal 

can be corrected to the nearest legal value by 
applying soft limits and gain slopes to a constant 

luminance color correction process (218) . In 
accordance with the present invention, illegal 

colors of a video signal can be highlighted (238) to 
provide an output drive (244) for a video display 

which can be easily monitored by an editor. 
Alternate features of the present invention relate 

to error detecting and monitoring (214) by assigning 
a specific, unique address to each video frame of a 

video signal. A further feature of the present 
invention relates to use of a pixel selecting means 

(252) which receives 4:2:2 video data in either 
serial or parallel form. The data is converted to 

an analog component format and used to drive a video 
display monitor where the video image is displayed. 

The pixel selecting means can, for example, include 
a mouse/trackball input (256) which is correlated to 

the video display monitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
video signal processing, and more particularly, to 
detection, correction and display of video signals. During video signal processing, numerous data 
formats are used to represent image information 
associated with each pixel of a video field so that 
an original image can be faithfully reproduced. For 
example, one common color format represents a color 
using red, green, and blue color components. With 
this color format, the color of each pixel is 
represented by quantities of red (R), green (G) and 
blue (B) color components detected in the original 
image (referred to hereafter as an R,G,B format). 
Another format used to represent a particular color 
is by the amounts of hue (⊖), saturation (S), and 
luminance (Y) included therein (referred to herein 
as the Y,S,⊖ format). Table 1 lists these two color formats, along 
with three additional color formats: 
A series of mathematical transformations exists 
between these various color formats. However,  
 
because each of these color formats is implemented 
differently in the real world, conflicts exist in 
moving between them. These conflicts derive from 
the fact that different color formats possess 
different characteristics, such as analog versus 
digital characteristics and component signal versus 
composite signal characteristics. For example, the R,G,B color format is an 
analog format because the video signals are analog 
in nature and vary, for example, between 0 and +0.7 
volts. Further, the R,G,B format is a component 
format because the entire video signal is 
transmitted in 3 component parts using three 
separate R,G,B signal paths. A common use of this 
transmission format is in computer graphics 
equipment and computer displays. This can be 
contrasted with a composite video signal, where the 
video signal is contained and transmitted in its 
entirety on a single signal path. A Y,U,V format is an analog component format 
which is very similar to the R,G,B, format. The 
Y,U,V format includes a luminance (Y) component, an 
in phase chroma component (U) and a quadrature phase 
component (V). This format separates luminance (or 
brightness) information from chrominance (or color) 
information, wherein Y represents luminance, and U 
and V together represent chrominance. The Y,U,V 
format is sometimes preferred over the R,G,B format 
because a black and white monitor can be driven with 
just the Y signal. A transformation between the 
R,G,B and Y,U,V format is as follows: 
Y = .299 * R + .587 * G +
