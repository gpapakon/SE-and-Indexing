<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic actuator (10) is disclosed having a ferromagnetic case (12) and defining a central axis with a slidable core (16) disposed coaxial with the central axis. The core includes first end (20), second end (22) and core (24) portions. The actuator (10) further includes a magnetic flux developing element (18) mounted coaxial with the central axis and first and second ferromagnetic electrical coils (14). The first and second coils (14) are mounted in a facing relationship with the first (20) and second (22) end portions of the core (16). The coils (14) have a cross-sectional length in a direction perpendicular to the central axis and a width of insulating space between the turns of the coils (14) in a direction parallel to the central axis. The length and width are selected such that the reluctance of the width of the insulating space is greater than the reluctance of the cross-sectional length of the coil wire adjacent the insulating space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electromagnetic 
actuators, and more particularly to an electromagnetic actuator using 
coil constructed from ferromagnetic materials. In the past, electromagnetic actuators, electromagnets, and other 
devices utilizing the interaction of electrical current and magnetic 
fields were customarily constructed such that the electrical current 
would flow in either a copper or aluminum material. This choice of 
material was based on the fact that copper and aluminum have  
 
substantially lower electrical resistivity than most other materials, yet 
are available at a relatively low cost. The low electrical resistivity is 
desirable in that, for a given current flowing in a conductor of a given 
geometry, the rate at which heat is generated is directly proportional to 
the electrical resistivity. Therefore, the use of copper or aluminum 
material in the coils is believed to reduce the heat generated and 
accordingly, reduce the energy lost to the heat. This reduction in heat 
is generally characteristic of devices having greater useful output per 
energy expended, and thus greater efficiency. Many electromechanical devices use ferromagnetic materials to 
enhance or focus the magnetic fields upon which the device function 
depends. In these cases, the key property of the ferromagnetic materials 
is their high magnetic permeability. The magnetic field or flux lines 
will follow paths of volumes of high permeability. Therefore, the use 
of the ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and a wide 
variety of specialized alloys is also desired. For a large class of electromagnetic devices, forces are produced 
by currents that flow in material placed in a magnetic field. In the prior 
art, ferromagnetic materials were used to guide, focus, and enhance the 
magnetic fields, and currents were made to flow in materials of low 
resistivity, such as copper or aluminum. The efficiency of such devices 
depends on the simultaneous presence of currents and magnetic flux 
in certain volumes. The insertion of copper or aluminum in these 
volumes reduces the magnetic flux by large factors from the amount of 
flux that would exist in an construction entirely of ferromagnetic 
materials. Electromagnetic actuators utilizing the above principles are known 
from US-A- 5 099 158 and US-A- 4 912 343, both assigned to the assignee 
of the invention described in the present application. Therefore, a need exists for an electromagnetic actuator design 
that uses ferromagnetic
