<ABSTRACT>
A power factor control system for a rectifier (205) generates estimators 
of control input parameters (a peak squared input AC voltage E 2 / m and load power) 

and uses these substantially ripple free signals to control a boost, buck, buck-boost, 
SEPIC or other related type converter (230) at the input to the rectifier. The 

generation of these parameters allows the derivation of a programmed current i
p
 
(output of 221) which is used to control the wave form of the actual input current. 

The control procedure is based on a quarter cycle averaged power basis. The input 
power is derived from the rms values of the input voltage and current. Given the 

output power and its deviations in power due to load changes, the programmed 
current i
p
 is determined by deriving an input conductance of the rectifier and 
combining it with the input voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power factor enhancement
systems.Control of power factor at the input of a power circuit, powered off of an
AC power line typically designated as an off line switcher (OLS), is critical to both
the integrity of the AC power line as well as the efficient operation and transient
response of the power circuit itself. In theory the power factor can attain a unity
value by forcing the input current waveform to conform exactly to a sinusoidal
waveform in phase with the fundamental of the sinusoidal voltage waveform input.
Many techniques have been advanced to achieve this current waveform control.
Some of the earlier techniques use passive networks with reactive components to
shape the input current waveform. As power factor and other operating requirements
of the power supply become more demanding the trend has been toward the use of
active power factor control networks to control the input current waveform.Active power factor control networks typically sense input and output
signal parameters of the power circuit and utilize a rectifier followed by a boost,
buck, buck-boost, SEPIC or similar power trains connected between the AC line and
the power circuit to enhance the power factor. The boost power train includes a
power switch selectively switched or pulse width modulated in response to these
signal parameters to force the input current to conform to a desired or programmed
current waveform. In a particular illustrative arrangement disclosed in U. S. patent
4,412,277 a rectified input AC voltage waveform is multiplied with an error voltage
representing the deviation of the output voltage from a regulated value. The
resulting control signal is scaled to provide a programmed AC current waveform ip.
This waveform is used to control the modulation of a pulse driving the power switch
of the boost power train to provide the desired input current waveform and hence
advance the power factor value more closely to a unity value.An improved power factor control arrangement disclosed in U. S. patent
4,677,366 uses an instantaneous rms value of the input AC voltage as a control
variable to provide a suitable transient response to changes in the amplitude of the
waveform of the AC line voltage. This control arrangement includes a feed-forward
control, added to accommodate rapid changes occurring in the rms value of the input 
AC voltage. This feed-forward arrangement scales the programmed current ip,
inversely by the square of the rms input voltage.A problem with these existing arrangements is
