<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel substituted 
amic acid derivatives, a process for their production and 
their use. More particularly, the substituted amic acid 
derivatives of the present invention have squalene 
synthase-inhibitory activities and are thus useful for 
treatment and prophylaxis of hypercholesterolemia, 
hyperlipemia and arteriosclerosis. Further, the 
substituted amic acid derivatives of the present 
invention have antifungal activities and are thus useful 
also as therapeutic and preventive agents for fungus 
infectious diseases. EP-A-0339878 discloses propanamine derivatives which are used as antifungal 
and/or anticoagulant agents. In recent years, increases of arteriosclerosis and 
accompanying coronary and cerebral disorders due to 
changes in the eating habits and an increase of old aged 
population, have bean pointed out. Various factors are 
thought to predipose to development of arteriosclerosis. 
However, an increase of cholesterol level in blood is one 
of the most major risk factors, and it is known that an 
agent for reducing cholesterol level in blood is  
 
effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of 
arteriosclerosis (Agents Used to Treat Hyperlipidemia, 
Drug Evaluations 6th. edition, 903-926 (1986)). The biosynthesis of cholesterol in vivo is generally 
as follows. 
Presently commercially available lovastatin, 
pravastatin and simvastatin are excellent 
hypocholesterolemic agents which selectively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA 
(hereinafter referred to 
simply as HMG-CoA) reductase and thus block the 
biosynthesis of cholesterol. However, these HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors inhibit relatively early stage in  
 
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and thus have a 
drawback that they also inhibit the biosynthesis of 
ubiquinone, dolichol, isopentenyl t-RNA, etc. which are 
essential for organism. On the other hand, squalene synthase is an enzyme 
which works at relatively late stage in the pathway, as 
compared with the HMG-CoA reductase, and an agent capable 
of inhibiting the squalene synthase is expected to be a 
safer hypocholesterolemic agent with less side effects. Further, if an agent is capable of inhibiting the 
squalene synthase in a biosynthesis system of sterol 
which is an essential constituting component of a fungus 
cell membrane and thus capable of inducing a cell 
membrane disorder and suppressing the growth of fungus, 
such an agent may be developed as an antifungal agent. As compounds having squalene synthase inhibitory 
activities,
