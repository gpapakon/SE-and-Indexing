<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an electric power steering 
apparatus, in which one of a pair of switching 

elements (Q₁),(Q₂),(Q₃),(Q₄) that 
has been PWM controlled is turned off and the other switching 

element is PWM controlled instead when a steering wheel 
is returning to its neutral position, thereby allowing the 

steering wheel to return smoothly and preventing a control 
hunting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus, and more particularly it relates to 
improvement in motor driving while a steering wheel is 
returning to its initial position. In an electric power steering apparatus widely used 
these days 
(see e.g. GB-A-2 188 890), 
a motor is driven by a current value corresponding 
to detected steering torque, and the thus obtained 
driving force of the motor is transferred to a steering 
mechanism so as to assist the steering power. FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the configuration 
of a motor control circuit in a conventional electric power 
steering apparatus. FETs Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 form a bridge 
circuit between a power supply E and a ground terminal. A 
motor M and a resistance R for detecting a motor driving 
current are connected in series so as to bridge the contact 
between the FETs Q1 and Q3 connected in series and the 
contact between the FETs Q2 and Q4 also connected in series. 
The voltages at both ends of the resistance R for detecting 
a motor driving current are respectively inputted to the  
 
non-inverted input terminal and the inverted input terminal 
of a differential amplifier 4, which outputs a differential 
output generated in accordance with the inputted voltages as 
a signal Id being equivalent to the motor driving current. 
Further, the FETs Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 contain free wheeling 
diodes D1, D2, D3 and D4 connected thereto in parallel, 
respectively. A value of steering torque supplied to a steering wheel 
(not shown) and detected by a torque sensor 5 is inputted to 
a signal processor 3, which outputs, in accordance with the 
detected torque, a signal I1 being equivalent to a target 
motor current (i.e., a target value of a motor current) to 
the non-inverted input terminal of a differential amplifier 
1. To the inverted input terminal of the differential 
amplifier 1 is inputted the signal Id being equivalent to 
the aforementioned motor driving current. The differential 
amplifier 1 outputs to an FET driving circuit 2 a difference 
between these inputted values as a signal V1 being 
equivalent to a target motor voltage required for supplying 
the target motor current to the motor M. In the FET driving 
circuit 2, a motor driving voltage VN is generated from the 
signal V1 being equivalent to the target motor voltage. By 
using a duty ratio in accordance with the magnitude of the 
absolute value of the motor driving voltage VN, and also in 
accordance with the polarity of the motor driving voltage  
 
VN, the
