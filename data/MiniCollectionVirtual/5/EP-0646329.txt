<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for supplying tobacco to cigarette-making machines is made up of three main sections: one section for receiving one or more tobacco mixes (2), one section for distributing the tobacco (3) and one section for feeding the tobacco (4) to the cigarette-making machines. The section for distributing the tobacco comprises in particular at least one mobile container (30) which can be placed beneath (facing) the mouth of an outlet (21) in the receiving section, and then conveying this tobacco to a hopper (40) in the feeding section. In this way, the tobacco is conveyed without it being damaged, the supply of a tobacco of constant quality to the cigarette-making machines is continuous, and allocating a specific tobacco mix to a specific cigarette-making machine is a straightforward procedure.

Installation for feeding tobacco to machines for manufacturing
products of the tobacco industry, especially cigarettes, comprising


a tobacco-bringing part (2) including

at least one tobacco-conveying means (20, 20A),
a tobacco-distributing part (4) including

at least one distribution hopper (40) feeding at least one cigarette-making
machine,

   characterised in that it further comprises a tobacco-apportioning part (3)
including
a plurality of containers (30) equipped with closing/ opening means (31)
for their lower orifices and disposed on the periphery of a support carriage (38)

able to be moved along guide means (32), each of said containers being fixed
to said chariot support by support means (39), said support carriage being

capable of coming to position successively at least one container opposite a
tobacco-feeding part (2) and at least one container opposite a distribution

hopper (40).
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the tobacco-feeding
part (2) further comprises at least one outlet (21; 28) fed by one of said

conveying means (20, 20A; 24, 25; 27).
Installation according to claim 2, characterised in that the outlet (21) is
equipped with closing/ opening means (23) for its lower orifice.
Installation according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the connections of the orifices of the outlets (21; 28) to the containers (30) as

well as of the containers to the hoppers (40) are provided with radial fluid-tightness
means (29, 49).
Installation according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
the walls (34, 44) of the containers (30) and of the hoppers (40) are provided 

with vents (35, 45) opening out into an outside chamber (36, 46) provided with
a dust filter (37, 47).
Installation according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the walls of the outlets (21) are provided with vents opening out into an outside

chamber provided with a dust filter.
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the support
means (39) are telescopic, being capable of moving the containers (30) closer

to or away from the support carriage (38).
Installation according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that
it further comprises control means (5) including:


a control unit (50) receiving condition signals from
sensor means (51, 52) capable of detecting the level of tobacco in the
distribution hopper or hoppers (40), and
sensor means (53) capable of detecting the position of the movable
container or containers,

   said control unit (50) being capable of controlling a first movement of a
movable container (30) opposite a tobacco-bringing part (2), then of controlling

the filling of said container and a second movement of said container toward a
distribution hopper (40), whose sensor means (52) have signalled a low level,

then of controlling the emptying of said container into said distribution hopper,

   said control unit being equipped with a data-processing program.
Installation according to claim 8, characterised in that the control unit
(50) is further capable of controlling the opening or the closing of opening/closing

means (31) of said container or containers (30).
Installation according to one of the claims 8 or 9, characterised in
that said data-processing program contains data permitting a given blend of

tobacco coming from a bringing part (2) to be attributed to a given distribution
hopper (40) feeding one or more manufacturing machines using said given

blend. 
Installation according to claim 10, characterised in that the control
unit (50) further receives state signals from sensor means (54) capable of

detecting the level of tobacco in the outlet or outlets (21).
Installation according to claim 11, characterised in that the control
unit (50) is further capable of controlling the opening or the closing of the

opening/ closing means (23) of the outlet or outlets (21).
