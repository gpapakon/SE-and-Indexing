<ABSTRACT>
Multimeric hybrid genes encoding the corresponding chimeric protein comprise a gene sequence coding for an antigenic region of a protein from a first pathogen linked to a gene sequence coding for an antigenic region of a protein from a second pathogen. The pathogens particularly are parainfluenza virus (PIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A single recombinant immunogen is capable of protecting infants and similar susceptible individuals against diseases caused by both PIV and RSV.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the engineering and
expression of multimeric hybrid genes containing
sequences from the gene coding for immunogenic proteins
or protein fragments of numerous pathogens.The advantage of the approach taken by the present
invention is to produce single immunogens containing
protective antigens from a range of pathogens. Such
chimeras greatly simplify the development of combination
vaccines, in particular, with the view ultimately to
produce single dose multivalent vaccines. Multivalent
vaccines are currently made by separately producing
pathogens and/or their pertinent antigens and combining
them in various formulations. This is a labour
intensive, costly and complex manufacturing procedure.
In contrast, the availability of a single immunogen
capable of protecting against a range of diseases would
solve many of the problems of multivalent vaccine
production. Several chimeric immunogens of the type
provided herein may be combined to decrease the number of
individual antigens required in a multivalent vaccine.Human Parainfluenza virus types 1,2,3 and
Respiratory syncytial virus types A and B are the major
viral pathogens responsible for causing severe
respiratory tract infections in infants and young
children. It is estimated that, in the United States
alone, approximately 1.6 million infants under one year
of age will have a clinically significant RSV infection
each year and an additional 1.4 million infants will be
infected with PIV-3. Approximately 4000 infants less
than one year of age in the United States die each year
from complications arising from severe respiratory tract
disease caused by infection with RSV and PIV-3. The WHO 
and NIALD vaccine advisory committees ranked RSV number two
behind HIV for vaccine development while the preparation of
an efficacious PIV-3 vaccine is ranked in the top ten
vaccines considered a priority for vaccine development.Safe and effective vaccines for protecting infants
against these viral infections are not available and are
urgently required. Clinical trials have shown that
formaldehyde-inactivated and live-attenuated viral vaccines
failed to adequately protect vaccinees against these
infections. In fact, infants who received the formalin-inactivated
RSV vaccine developed more serious lower
respiratory tract disease during subsequent natural RSV
infection than did the control group. [Am.J.Epidemiology 89,
1969, p.405-421; J.Inf.Dis.145, 1982, p.311-319].
