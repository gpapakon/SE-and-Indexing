<DESCRIPTION>
Alkylating agents are an important class of anticancer drugs, which express their 
cytotoxic and antitumour effects by forming adducts with cellular DNA (Garcia 
et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1988, 37, 3189). Chem. Abstr. Vol. 66, Abstract 10687m relates to the 
synthesis of 2,4-dinitrophenol derivatives as antineoplastic 
agents. The synthesis of 2,4-dinitro-6-[N,N-bis(β-hydroxyethyl)amino]phenol,2,4-dinitro-6-[N,N-bis(β-chloroethyl)amino]phenol, 
and O-(β-hydroxyethyl)-2,4-dinitro-6-(N-benzoylamino)phenol 
and the corresponding (β-chloroethyl) 
derivative is described. The present invention relates to novel nitroaniline-based alkylating agents having 
activity as hypoxia-selective cytotoxins, reductively-activated prodrugs for cytotoxins, 
hypoxic cell radiosensitisers, and anticancer agents, to methods of preparing the 
novel compounds, and to the use of these compounds as antitumour agents. In one aspect, the present invention relates to the class of nitroaniline derivatives 
represented by the general formula (I); 
 
where the nitro group is substituted at any one of the available benzene positions 
2-6; where R and A separately represent the groups NO2, CN, COOR1, CONR1R2, 
CSNR1R2 or SO2NR1R2 and A is substituted at one of the available benzene 
positions 2-6; where B represents N(CH2CH2halogen)2 or N(CH2CH2OSO2R3)2 
substituted at any one of the available benzene positions; and where R1, R2 and R3  
 
separately represent H, or lower alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxyl, ether, 
carboxyl or amino functions, including cyclic structures, or R1 and R2 together with 
the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic structure. Where R1, R2 and/or R3 represent lower alkyl, the group contains from 1 to 6 
carbon atoms. Where R1, R2 and/or R3 represent groups containing tertiary amines, the N-oxides 
of those tertiary amine moieties are also included. The compounds of formula (I) have cytotoxic and antitumour activity, and are 
useful as hypoxia-selective cytotoxins, reductively-activated prodrugs for cytotoxins, 
hypoxic cell radiosensitisers, and anticancer agents. Some of the compounds of formula (I) form pharmaceutically-acceptable addition 
salts with both organic and inorganic acids, and these addition salts also form part 
of the present invention. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are 
hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, 
fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic, isethionic and the like. Some
