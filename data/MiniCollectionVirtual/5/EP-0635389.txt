<ABSTRACT>
A system and method are disclosed for controlling 
a shift even in a transmission (14) wherein a shift 

actuator (30,48) develops a force to effect the engagement 
of a clutch collar and a gear. The method comprises 

detecting when a non-fully engaged condition of the 
clutch collar and the gear occurs, indicating either a 

tooth butt or torque lock condition, and then pulsing 
the shift actuator (30,48), when the non-fully engaged 

condition is detected, between a relatively low force 
and a relatively high force to disturb the clutch collar 

and the gear out of the non-fully engaged condition. 
The detecting step comprises examining either the axial 

position of the clutch collar or the axial position of 
a shift rail operatively connected to the clutch collar 

with a rail position sensor (43). Preferably, a signal 
having a modulated pulse width and a frequency of 

between about 5 and 20 Hertz is sent to the shift 
actuator. The system which embodies this method is 

disclosed in the forms of an automated mechanical 
transmission having sliding clutch collars (122,124,126) 

and a transmission system having a standard friction 
master clutch interposed between the engine and the 

transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system and method for 
controlling the operation of an automated mechanical 
transmission of a motor vehicle, and more particularly 
to such a system and method for sensing tooth butt 
and/or torque lock conditions and for taking action to 
overcome these conditions. Automatic mechanical transmission systems 
comprising mechanical transmissions and controls and 
actuators to automatically shift same, usually 
electronically controlled in accordance with sensed 
inputs and predetermined logic rules, are known. 
Examples of such systems may be seen by reference to 
U.S. Patent No. 4,648,290, U.S. Patent No. 4,642,771, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,595,986, U.S. Patent No. 4,527,447, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,361,060, U.S. Patent No. 4,140,031 and 
U.S. Patent No. 4,081,065. 
Such systems may also 
be seen by reference to SAE Paper No. 831776 titled 
"AUTOMATED MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION CONTROLS". 
Fault tolerant logic routines for automatic 
transmissions are known as may be seen by reference to 
U.S. Patent No. 4,922,425, U.S. Patent No. 4,849,899 and 
U.S. Patent No. 4,899,279. Electronic and other engine fuel control systems 
wherein the fuel supplied to the engine may be modulated  
 
to provide a desired engine speed, regardless of the 
operator's setting of the throttle pedal, are known in 
the prior art. Such systems may be seen by reference to 
U.S. Patent No. 4,081,065, U.S. Patent No. 4,361,060, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,792,901 and by reference to SAE J1922 
and SAE J1936 electronic engine control standards, and 
related standards SAE J1708, J1587 and J1843. EP-A-0 293 321 discloses a method and apparatus for 
continuously and smoothly 
controlling the output of a fluid-pressure differential 
cylinder suitable for use with an automatic clutch and an 
automatic transmission. In order 
to achieve a fine power control i.e. for half-clutching, 
an apparatus for controlling a fluid pressure differential 
cylinder is provided with an apparatus which comprises 
three solenoid operated valves disposed in connecting 
passages for making and blocking a fluid communication to 
and fro and between chambers of the actuator. A pulse 
generator is connected with two of the three solenoid 
operated valves for issuing a high frequency pulse 
signal having a pulse repetition period shorter than an 
on-off response time of each of the respective solenoid 
operated valves. The duty factor of said pulse signal is 
variable. With this regulation an inflow and an outflow of 
pressurized fluid can properly be
