<CLAIMS>
A multi-coordinate feeler head (1; 1
2
; 1
3
; 1
4
) with a feeler rod (4; 4
2
; 4
3
; 4
4
) capable of
deflection in three coordinate directions (X, Y, Z), at whose end is located a feeler ball (5; 5
2
; 5
3
;
5
4
), whose centre forms a feeler origin for feeling an object (W), and with sensors (13; 13
2
; 13
3
;
13
4
) for detecting the feeling operation which are so arranged that their measuring axes intersect

in the feeler origin (15; 15
2
; 15
3
; 15
4
), characterized in that the sensors (13; 13
2
; 13
3
; 13
4
)
provide quantitative signals, from which measurement values for the movement of the feeler ball

(5; 5
2
; 5
3
; 5
4
) in the three coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) are calculated.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1, characterized in that the sensors (13) are in
the form of distance sensors.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1, characterized in that the sensors are in the
form of measuring systems (13
2
; 13
3
; 13
4
) operating incrementally or in coded manner.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 3, characterized in that the sensors are in the
form of photoelectric measuring systems (13
2
; 13
3
; 13
4
).
