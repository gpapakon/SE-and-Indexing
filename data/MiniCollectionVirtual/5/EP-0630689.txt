<ABSTRACT>
A rotating impact sprinkler comprises means for connecting a 
pressurized water column to a rotating joint which supports 

a rotating assembly (7) which is formed by a tubular body 
(8) with a nozzle (12) for generating a jet, an oscillating 

arm (20) and deflection means mounted at the end of the arm 
so as to interact with the jet. The deflection means 

comprise at least one main deflector (40) which oscillates 
elastically in a direction which is transverse to the arm 

between a central equilibrium position, in which the surface 
affected by the jet is minimal, and at least one lateral 

abutment position, in which the surface affected by the jet 
is maximal. The variation in cross section in passing from 

the minimal surface to the maximal one is sudden, so as to 
instantly increase the withdrawal of energy from the jet and 

generate impulsive forces on the deflector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotating joint for
sprinklers, of the type used to perform irrigation on an
entire circumference or on partial sectors.Conventional sprinklers of this type are generally placed on
trolleys, or supporting frames, and comprise means for
connecting a pressurized water column to a rotating joint,
which in turn supports an assembly which rotates about the
axis of the joint. The assembly is essentially formed by a
tubular body which has, at one open end, an adapted nozzle
for generating a jet which is inclined with respect to the
axis of rotation of the assembly. Propulsion and jet-breaking
means are mounted on the tubular body and are
generally constituted by one or more arms which oscillate
about an axis which is substantially perpendicular to the
axis of rotation of the assembly and have one end suitable
for periodically interacting with the jet.At the end affected by the jet, each oscillating arm is
provided with one or more deflectors suitable for partially
deflecting the jet, generating reaction forces which have
components which are parallel and perpendicular to the axis
of rotation of the assembly and cause a periodic
oscillation of the arm and a stepwise rotary motion of the
entire assembly.In order to prevent the uncontrolled rotation of the
assembly in excessively large incremental steps, which would
not allow an effective irrigation, an adapted brake device
is inserted in the rotating joint which supports the 
assembly, for contrasting the rotation of the assembly about
its own main axis.An essential requirement for sprinklers of the above
described type is that the rotation rate of the rotating
assembly must be approximately constant as the pressure and
flow-rate of the jet and the attitude of the sprinkler vary.
In fact, if the axis of rotation of the sprinkler is
inclined with respect to the vertical, the components of
the reaction forces and of the braking forces may vary,
altering the rotation rate of the sprinkler, with
consequent modifications and non-uniformities in the
irrigation conditions.Some sprinklers of the above described type which
satisfactorily perform their task are known for example from US-A-3 744 720; however, they can
furthermore be improved so as to eliminate some acknowledged
disadvantages.One of these disadvantages is constituted by the substantial
non-uniformity in the operation of sprinklers at low water
feed pressures, which become increasingly necessary in order
to reduce facility management costs and in general to limit
energy

<CLAIMS>
A rotating joint for sprinklers comprising a fixed lower
portion (2, 5, 101), connected to said pressurized water

pipe (3), and a rotatable upper portion (6, 108, 109),

connected to a tubular element (8) and adapted to rotate
with respect to said fixed lower portion about a

substantially vertical axis, brake means acting on said
rotatable upper portion for contrasting the rotation

thereof, characterized in that said brake means (100)
comprises a pair of opposite disks (102, 102') which are

rigidly fixed to said fixed lower portion (2, 5, 101) and a
pair of braking rings (120, 120') which are rigidly

associated with said rotatable upper portion and act on said
disks (102, 102') on opposite sides thereof.
Rotating joint according to claim 1, characterized in
that said disks (102, 102') have a substantially in-shaped

radial cross-section, with a planar annular portion (103,
103') and a pair of cylindrical edges (104, 104'; 105,

105').
Rotating joint, according to either claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that said braking rings (120, 120') are

constituted by annular bodies which have a series of
substantially cylindrical angularly spaced pivots (121,

121') arranged on one of their planar faces and intended to
be accommodated in corresponding cavities (114, 114')

defined in said movable upper portion to be pulled along by
the rotation of said movable upper portion.
Rotating joint according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said rotatable upper portion 

comprises an upper cover (108) and a bottom (111), elastic
means (130) being arranged between said cover (108) and the

upper braking ring (120), said elastic means being suitable
for compressing said upper ring (120) against the respective

disk (102).
Rotating joint according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said lower braking ring (120')

is rigidly associated with said bottom (111) so that the
pressure exerted by the water on the inner surface of said

movable upper portion determines a proportional thrust on
said lower braking ring (120').
Rotating joint according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said elbow coupling (9) has

such an inclination angle () that the line of action of
the resultant (R) of the reaction forces exerted by the

barrel (8) on said coupling (9) is substantially directed
toward the surfaces of mutual contact between said braking

rings (120, 120') and said disks (102, 102') so as to
increase the braking action proportionally to the energy of

the jet.
Rotating joint according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the lever arm of said

resultant (R) has minimal dimensions, compatibly with the
geometry of the coupling (9), so that the overturning torque

of said resultant is approximately centered in an axial
region of the joint, proximate to the gaskets (140, 141 and

142), with consequent minimal stresses and local
deformations of said gaskets. 
Rotating joint according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said elbow coupling (9) is

interchangeable with other ones having different values of
said angle () in order to vary the inclination of the jet.
