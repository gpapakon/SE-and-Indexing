<ABSTRACT>
Device making it possible to employ elastic foundations of railway networks, intended to filter out vibrational pollution caused by the passage of trains or subway trains in a built-up area. The invention relates to long concrete slabs, resting on coil springs combined with shock-absorbers on which the railway tracks are installed. These long slabs are poured in situ and lifted, after curing, onto their elastic supports under the action of hydraulic jacks.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the construction of elastic foundations on ponctual supports for railways, 
characterised
by
 :

a case (1) with anchor bars (4) to fix it to a foundation slab (2)
when pouring concrete on the primary slab, the case beeing fitted with an internal

support collar,
an helicoid spring unit (5) integrated in the case, meant to cooperate with the
primary slab and the support collar to be used as a ponctual support, low frequency,

for the foundation slab,
a trefoil (6) equiped with three regulation screws (8), the trefoil and the
internal support collar beeing formed in order to to make a unit of bayonet type

allowing on one side, the fitting of the trefoil inthez support collar to position it
between the collar and the spring unit, and on the other side. the rotation of the

trefoil in order to fill a support function against the collar, the regulation screws
allowing transmission to the spring unit, after lifting the foundation slab by jack (7),

temporarily locked in upper part of the case and taking support on the spring unit,
the efforts transmitted to the trefoil by the internal support collar.
Method as set forth in claim 1 
characterised in that
 the spring unit can be combined with a viscous
medium absorber.
Method as set forth in claim 1 and 2 
characterised in that
 inspection of the spring unit after the
setting to work of the elastic foundation to allow the adjustment in height and

frequency in a case of traffic railway increase is possible with the jack fitted and
locked in the case as during the lifing operations.
