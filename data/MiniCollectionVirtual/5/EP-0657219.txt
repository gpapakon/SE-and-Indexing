<ABSTRACT>
The rotary cutting members are shaped knives (4) borne by teeth (3) mounted on a single splined shaft (2), which knives pass through slots provided in the bottom (7) of the casing, the said bottom having a W-shaped profile, the middle central part of which forms a rib (9) which covers the said splined shaft, deflectors (11) being attached between the said rib and the inclined walls (10) of the bottom of the casing, which together with the said walls define cells of pyramidal shape with the vertex pointing downwards.
