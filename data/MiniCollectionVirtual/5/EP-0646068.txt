<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an anti-skid stud the operation of which is based on a larger than conventional diameter of the tip part (1) of the anti-skid stud and on its primarily annular contact with the road surface during normal driving, with a slight projection of the tip and with a small surface pressure, the projection increasing in situations in which it is needed, for example during braking, the external force P caused by the braking tilting the anti-skid stud in its position, whereupon the projected edge (5) of the tip part will penetrate over its entire width into the road surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anti-skid studs as specified in 
the preamble of Claim 1. Such anti-skid studs are well 
known from the state of the art. Anti-skid studs for vehicle tires are largely based on 
the principle of a spike projecting out from the tire and 
being made up of a thin hard-metal stud, 2 - 3 mm in 
diameter, which is surrounded in a varying manner by 
metal or plastic or by a combination of the two. All of 
them have the disadvantage that the small hard-metal tip 
subjects the road to a relatively high surface pressure, 
which wears an ice-free road, and that, on the other 
hand, its grip is very poor on a thin so-called black ice 
surface, which the tip of the stud cannot penetrate. As 
a result, a stud, rounded by wear, will skate on the ice 
surface, with a friction coefficient even lower than that 
of rubber. An anti-skid stud according to the present invention 
reduces the disadvantages referred to above. To this 
end, an anti-skid stud in accordance with the present 
invention is characterised by the features specified in 
the characterising part of Claim 1. A special embodiment 
is claimed in Claim 2. The invention is described below in greater detail with 
reference to the drawings, in which: 
Figures 1 and 5 depict each a vertical section of a side 
elevation of an anti-skid stud according to the 
invention;  
 Figure 2 depicts the anti-skid stud installed in a 
vehicle tire, the tire part being at rest or rolling 
against an icy road surface; Figure 3 depicts the anti-skid stud in a vehicle tire 
against the road surface when braking force or some other 
horizontal force is acting between the road and the tire; Figure 4 depicts the wide and deep contact area produced 
by the anti-skid stud in an icy road surface at the time 
of braking or acceleration, or when the vehicle tends, 
for example, to side-slip. An anti-skid stud according to the invention is 
characterised in that the fastening flanged (15) anti-skid 
stud (Figures 1 and 5), installed in a vehicle tire 
in a conventional manner, has no conventional hard-metal 
pin; the anti-skid tip 1 of the stud has in the gripping 
area 5 a diameter (in general 5... 12 mm) which is large 
in comparison with the total length of the anti-skid 
stud. In Figure 1 the tip of the stud constitutes a 
concave or straight surface 2, in which case its road 
contact is primarily annular and wide when the stud is in 
its basic position perpendicular to the road surface 
(Figure 2). Owing to the width of the contact area, the 
surface
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An anti-skid stud, provided with a fastening flange 
(15), to be installed in a conventional manner in a bed-hole 

(10) prepared in advance in the tread of a vehicle 
tire, characterised in that the tip (2) of the tip part 

(1), equal or somewhat smaller in diameter than the 
fastening flange of the anti-skid stud, is flat or 

concave, and that the grip of the anti-skid stud against 
a slippery road surface (8) occurs when the edge (5) of 

the tip (2) of the anti-skid stud projects from the 
surface (6 of the vehicle tire to a greater extent than 

in its stand-by position (Figure 2) when the anti-skid 
studs tilts, under the action of an external force (P) 

during braking, for example, whereupon the projecting 
edge (5) of the tip part will produce a wide (B in Figure 

4) grip, deeper (H in Figure 3) than in the stand-by 
position of the stud, against the icy road surface. 
An anti-skid stud according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that in the anti-skid stud the central 

part of that area of the anti-skid tip part (1) which 
comes into contact with the road surface is provided with 

a void (11) to prevent the tip from obtaining a convex 
shape during wear, or that the mantle surface (3) of the 

tip part (1) is, to a suitable depth, of a material more 
resistant to wear, i.e. primarily harder than the core 

material of the tip part (1), the tip of the tip part, 
when thus implemented, not obtaining a convex shape under 

the effect of wear during driving but obtaining a concave 
shape on its surface (2) or remaining almost flat.
