<ABSTRACT>
A signal processing apparatus is provided with 
processing units capable of reducing the number of 

signal processing means and the number of adjustments of 
a delay time between reversal and non-reversal of video-signal 

polarity in each of two signal paths in an 
arrangement in which two liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) 

are provided in a head-mounted display worn by an 
observer and each of the two displays is used to display 

video information viewed by the observer. The signal 
processing apparatus includes first and second signal 

sources (1 and 2) each of which generates a video 
signal, reversing unit 7 for reversing the polarity of 

one of the two video signals, first selector selectively 
supplying one of the video signals to the reversing 

unit, first and second display units (3 and 4) for 
converting the video signals to respective ones of 

optical signals, and second selector for selectively 
supplying a video signal whose polarity is or is not 

reversed by the reversing unit to the first and second 
display units.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image signal
processing apparatus for displaying an image. More
particularly, the invention relates to a signal
processing apparatus for displaying signals from two
signal sources on each of two display units.When video information is displayed on a display
device such as a liquid-crystal display (referred to as
an "LCD" hereinafter), it is necessary to prevent a
residual image caused by DC components in the video
signal. In the prior art, this is accomplished by using
a method in which the polarity of the video signal is
reversed at fixed periods.Further, head-mounted displays worn by an observer
have been proposed in which two LCDs are used and video
information for the left and right eyes of the observer
is displayed on respective ones of the LCDs. When two
LCDs are used, however, it is necessary that the video
signal be reversed in polarity on each signal path at
fixed periods. One conventional method of achieving
this is to provide each signal path with signal
processing means for polarity reversal and signal 
processing means for no reversal of polarity and switch
between the two means in each signal path. Another
method is to provide each signal path with one signal
processing means capable of switching between
reversed/non-reversed polarity, and switch the polarity
of the signal processing means per se to thereby change
over the polarity of the video signal.However, with the method of providing the signal
processing means for reversal and non-reversal in the
prior art described above, there are too many signal
processing means. And with the method of providing the
signal processing means that can be switched between
reversal/non-reversal and changing over the polarity of
this signal processing means, it is necessary to adjust
the amount of delay between reversal time and non-reversal
time in each signal processing means.Further, methods of displaying a three-dimensional
image on a display unit have been proposed in the prior
art. According to one method, video signals
representing left- and right-eye images of an object, in
which the images differ by an amount corresponding to
parallax between the two eyes of the observer, are fed
into a display unit such as CRT so as to alternate
between the left eye image field and the right eye image
field of the object. The observer wears a device such
as glasses having a shutter function. By opening and 
closing the shutters synchronously with the changeover between
the video signals for the left and right eyes, the image
