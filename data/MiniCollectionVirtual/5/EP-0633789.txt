A dressing, wound pad or carrier matrix, consisting of a
biocompatible open-pore polyurethane foam having a hydrogel

of guar gum embedded therein, and surfactants and/or
other additives, wherein said guar gum and the surfactants

and/or other additives are incorporated in the foam in
situ in a reaction of water with hydrophilic polyurethane

prepolymers based on toluenediisocyanate and/or methylenediphenyldiisocyanate,
characterized in that the guar gum

content is from 0.1 to 15%, and the water absorption capacity
of the finished product is less than three times

its initial weight.
The dressing, wound pad or carrier matrix according to
claim 1, characterized in that said other additives are

collagen, collagen derivatives, cellulose, cellulose derivatives,
agar or other gel-forming polysaccharides, or

mixtures thereof.
The dressing, wound pad or carrier matrix according to
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said additives are

wound healing promoting peptides, bactericidal or antimycotic
substances, or mixtures thereof.
The dressing, wound pad or carrier matrix according to any
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said additives are

enzymes, autologously grown cell associations or living
skin cells. 
The dressing, wound pad or carrier matrix according to any
of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that enzymes, biologically

active peptides, autologously grown cell associations
or living skin cells are bound to inert carrier particles

through which they are firmly bound to the surface
afterwards.
The dressing, wound pad or carrier matrix according to any
of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the side facing

away from the wound is covered by a water-impermeable
layer which is, however, permeable to gases and water vapor.
A method for the preparation of dressings, wound pads or
carrier matrices consisting of a biocompatible open-pore

polyurethane foam having a hydrogel of guar gum embedded
therein, wherein said polyurethane foam is prepared from

water-foamable hydrophilic polyurethane prepolymers based
on toluenediisocyanate and/or methylenediphenyldiisocyante

in the presence of dissolved guar gum and surfactants
and/or other additives, characterized in that the amount

of guar gum is from 0.1 to 15% and is chosen such that the
water absorption capacity of the finished product is less

than three times its initial weight.
The method according to claim 7, characterized in that
collagen, collagen derivatives, cellulose, cellulose derivatives,

agar or other gel-forming polysaccharides, or
mixtures thereof, are used as said other additives.
The method according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in
that wound healing promoting peptides, bactericidal or antimycotic

substances, or mixtures thereof are used as said
additives. 
The method according to any of claims 7 to 9, characterized
in that enzymes, autologously grown cell associations

or living skin cells are used as said additives.
The method according to any of claims 7 to 9, characterized
in that enzymes, biologically active peptides, autologously

grown cell associations or living skin cells are
bound to inert carrier particles through which they are

firmly bound to the surface afterwards.
