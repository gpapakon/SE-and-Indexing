<ABSTRACT>
A surface grinding method is provided by which grinding striations
are produced so that the striations can fully be removed by a polish-off

amount less than required in a conventional way in mirror polishing following
surface grinding using an infeed type surface grinder (12), in which two circular

tables (14,16), opposite to each other, which are driven and rotate independently from
each other, are arranged so that the peripheral end portion (18) of one table (14)

coincides with an axial center (20a) of a rotary shaft (20) of the other table (16) all time, the
two circular tables (14,16) being located so as to be shifted sideways from each other;

not only is a grinding stone (22) held fixedly on an opposite surface of the one table (14),
but the wafer (W) is fixed on an opposite surface of the other table (16); the two tables (14,16)

are rotated relatively to each other; and at least one table is pressed on the
other while at least one table is relatively moved in a direction, so that a

surface of the wafer (W) is ground, wherein the surface of the wafer (W) is ground
while controlling a pitch of grinding striations produced across all the surface

of the wafer (W) processed by the grinding stone (22) to be 1.6 mm or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infeed type surface grinding method as known from the closest prior art document US-A-3 905 162, 
followed by a 
mirror polishing step for a thin plate such as a semiconductor silicon wafer 
(hereinafter also simply referred to as wafer) by an infeed type surface 
grinder. In semiconductor wafer processing, a method has heretofore been 
adopted in which after a sliced wafer is chamfered along its peripheral portion, 
the sliced wafer is further subjected to lapping and etching in the order and 
thereafter, a surface thereof is mirror-polished. While, in the etching step, generally a total of about 40 µm has been 
removed on both surfaces in order to eliminate a work damage caused by 
lapping, the etching is a cause to reduce a flatness of a wafer in the final stage, 
in which mirror polishing is applied, since a flatness of a wafer is degraded by 
the etching. Hence, in recent years, surface grinding has been adopted instead of 
lapping or after the etching in order to correct a flatness. Since, in surface 
grinding, there arises no work damage as deep as in lapping, a surface-ground 
wafer can be polished directly without any etching or only after very light 
etching, which amounts to a removal, for example, of 4 to 5 µm in total on both 
surface. Therefore, adoption of surface grinding has an advantage to improve 
a wafer flatness, as compared with a conventional way.  
 In a case where a thin disc such as a semiconductor wafer is surface-ground, 
an infeed type surface grinder 12 as shown in FIG. 1 has very recently 
been employed. The surface grinder 12, which will be detailed later, has a 
construction and operating relations between constituents such that two 
circular tables 14 an 16, opposite to each other and one on the other, which are 
driven and rotate independently from each other, are arranged so that the 
peripheral end portion 18 of an upper table 14 coincides with the axial center 
20a of a rotary shaft 20 of a lower table 16 all time, the two circular tables 14 
and 16 being located so as to be shifted sideways from each other; not only is a 
grinding stone 22 held fixedly on a lower surface of the upper table 14, but a 
wafer (W) is fixed on an upper surface of the lower table 16; the tables 14 and 
16 arranged one on the other are rotated relatively to each other; and at least 
one table is pressed on the other while at least one table is moved in a vertical 
direction, so that a surface of the wafer (W) is ground. In a case where an infeed type
