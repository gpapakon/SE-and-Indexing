<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an eccentricity correction procedure for pneumatic tyres, preferably tubeless tyres having radial carcasses for cars having 5 DEG  rims, each tyre initially being mounted on a master rim which, apart from its particularly high precision, corresponds to the production rims envisaged for the relevant tyre, the tyre is subsequently inflated to an air pressure in the range from -0.3 bar to +0.2 bar about the envisaged maximum operating air pressure, after which the wheel, essentially consisting of master rim and tyre to be corrected, is pressed against a measuring device, for example against a drum-shaped force measuring device, and at least one radial variable is measured and - preferably electronically - is recorded as a function of the wheel angle of rotation which runs through the complete interval from 0 DEG  to 360 DEG , the minimum and the maximum are then determined, the difference between the two extremes, that is to say the maximum force or radius fluctuation, is subsequently determined, is then compared with the tolerance value to be permitted, after which the tyres whose maximum fluctuation lies above the permitted tolerance value are subjected to a correction in the bead area. In order to make a correction possible without additional components and without a local reduction of the profile depth, it is proposed that at those points where the local radial force or the local tyre radius is greater than the minimum plus the maximum tolerance, at least sufficient material is removed from the radially inwardly pointing seating surface of the tyre bead that subsequently the remaining fluctuations lie within the tolerance band.

Method of correcting the concentricity of pneumatic
tyres (1), preferably tubeless tyres, having a radial

carcase (2) for passenger vehicles with 5° rims, each tyre
(1) initially being mounted on a master rim (3) which,

apart from its particularly high degree of precision,
corresponds to the standard rims intended for the pertinent

tyre, at least in respect of the configuration of the
seating face, the tyre (1) is then inflated to an air

pressure in the range of between -0.3 bar and +0.2 bar
around the envisaged maximum operational air pressure,

whereupon the wheel (4), which substantially comprises
master rim (3) and tyre (1) to be corrected, is urged

towards a measuring device (5), for example towards a
drum-shaped force-measuring device (5a), and at least the

radial force F
r
 or the tyre radius R is measured as the
radial parameter and indicated - preferably electronically

- in dependence on the angle of wheel rotation (β), which
traverses the full range between 0° and 360°, then the

minimum F
r, min
, or respectively R
min
, and the maximum F
r
,

max
, or respectively R
max
, is determined, then the

difference between the two extremes, F
r, max
 - F
r, min
, or
respectively R
max
 - R
min
, the maximum radial force or
respectively radius variation is determined, which is then

compared with the permitted tolerance value, and the tyres
(1), which have a maximum variation above the permitted

tolerance value, are subjected to a correction in the bead
region, characterised in that, at the locations where the

local radial force (F
r
), or respectively the local tyre
radius (R), is greater than the minimum (F
r, min
 or
respectively R
min
) plus the maximum tolerance, at least so
much of the radially inwardly orientated seating face (6)

of the tyre bead (9) is abraded that the remaining
variations then lie within the tolerance range. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the abrading is effected by grinding.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the abrading is effected by laser beam.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that abrading is not effected over the

entire bead circumference, but some abrading is effected in
just one region of the bead circumference.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that,
after the measurement of the tyre, each bead to be

corrected is clamped in position in an apparatus (11),
which accommodates between 200° and 310° of the particular

bead circumference in the form of a rim (lla) and leaves
free the circumferential region of the particular bead,

from which some abrading is to be effected for the
correction of the concentricity.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
preferably according to claim 5, characterised in that the

first harmonic is especially filtered-out from the measured
radius variation or radial force variation - preferably by

Fourier analysis - and the abrading is so determined,
within the limits of the processable bead circumferential

region and the permissible degree of abrading, that the
amplitude of the first harmonic is lowered as far as

possible.
Method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the radial force F
r
 is
measured with its variation.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
more especially according to claim 7, characterised in that

the axial force F
a
 is also measured with its variation. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims 1
to 7, more especially according to claim 7, characterised

in that the radial force is simultaneously measured in two
adjacently disposed tracks, and the results of measuring

the left-hand track influence the abrading at the left-hand
bead, and the results of measuring the right-hand track

influence the abrading at the right-hand bead.
Method according to at least one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the tyre radius R is measured with

its variation.
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that
the tyre radius R is measured not at the crown (Z) but at

an axial spacing therefrom at both sides of the crown (Z),
preferably substantially above the bead cores (9a), and the

results of measuring the left-hand track influence the
abrading at the left-hand bead (9l), and the results of

measuring the right-hand track influence the abrading at
the right-hand bead (9r).
Clamping apparatus (11) for accomplishing a method
according to claim 4, characterised in that it has a

rim-like cross-sectional configuration, but a portion of
the circumference, within which the abrading tool (10)

operates, is recessed.
Apparatus (11) according to claim 12,
characterised in that the recessed circumferential region

has an extension of between 50° and 160°, preferably
substantially 90°.
Apparatus (11) according to claim 12 or 13,
characterised in that it also has internal clamping jaws

(11b) which, together with the rim-like external clamping
jaws (11a), irreversibly securedly clamp the bead (9) to be

processed. 
Apparatus (11) according to claim 14, characterised
in that the internal clamping jaws are configured as an

inflatable tube (11b).
Apparatus (11) according to one of the preceding
claims 12 to 15, characterised in that it is divided into a

left-hand part and a right-hand part, both parts being
securable in any desirable rotation relative to each other

so that an angular region at one bead (9l), which differs
from that at the other bead (9r), can remain free for

processing in a single tyre clamping operation.
