<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector assembly, 
comprising a plug connector and a socket connector mating therewith, 
which plug connector and socket connector can be pushed into 
one another, which plug connector is provided with at least two 
rows of terminal connections which are accommodated in a first 
plastic housing and at least one row of which consists of male terminal 
pins, and which socket connector is provided with at least 
two rows of terminal connections which are accommodated in a second 
plastic housing and at least one row of which consists of female 
terminal connections, one male terminal pin always being in electrically 
conducting contact with a female terminal connection when 
plug connector and socket connector are pushed into one another, 
the plug connector being provided with at least one electrically 
conducting first shielding member arranged between said rows of 
terminal connections in the plug connector and being rigidly accommodated 
in the first housing, the socket connector being provided 
with at least one conducting second shielding member arranged 
between said rows of terminal connections in the socket connector 
and being rigidly accommodated in a second housing and comprising 
at least one resilient contact element, which first shielding member 
and second shielding member make electrically conducting contact 
with one another when the plug connector and the socket connector 
have been pushed into one another. Such a connector assembly is disclosed by the International 
Patent Application WO 88.04484. This describes two connectors, a 
plug connector and a socket connector which can be pushed onto one 
another. The plug connector comprises two rows of male terminal 
pins which are able to mate with two rows of female terminal connections 
of the socket connector. Between the two rows of male 
terminal pins in the housing of the plug connector there is accommodated 
at least one plate-type shielding member. Accommodated 
between the two rows of female terminal connections in the housing 
of the socket connector is also a shielding member which has a 
female structure with sprung lips which grip round the plate-type  
 
shielding member of the plug connector if the plug connector is 
connected to the socket connector. If a plug connector and a socket 
connector are connected, shielding against electromagnetic interference 
is therefore produced between the two said rows of male and 
female terminals. The shielding members may optionally be used for 
powe
