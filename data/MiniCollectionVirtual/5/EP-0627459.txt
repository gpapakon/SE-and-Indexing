<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a thermoplastic resin 
composition that is reinforced with glass fiber. In particular, 
the present invention concerns a thermoplastic resin composition 
that is a thermoplastic polycyclohexanedimethylene terephthalate 
(hereinafter abbreviated to "PCT") resin and that is colored with 
a pigment. Thermoplastic resins reinforced with glass fiber are 
especially superior to nonreinforced thermoplastic resin as a 
synthetic resin material in the field of injection molding. Such 
thermoplastic resins possess improved mechanical characteristics, 
in particular, excellent tensile strength, thermal stability and 
a high modulus of elasticity. However, it has been known for many years that the physical 
properties of glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins colored 
with inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide are inferior to 
those of like materials that are not colored. Specifically, some 
of the reinforcing effect imparted by the glass is lost. Many of 
the other glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins experience 
a certain reduction in impact strength. Inorganic pigments possess clearly evident advantages as 
compared to ordinary organic dyes and pigments. Such inorganic 
pigments possess high thermal stability and resistance to the 
high temperatures required in the extrusion molding or injection 
molding of glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins. The 
glass fiber content requires a much higher temperature than that 
needed in the working of materials that are not reinforced. Moreover, only inorganic white pigments have the high index 
of refraction needed to guarantee good optical dispersion and 
high brightening. For this reason, titanium dioxide is often 
used as a white pigment in formulations for pigments and pigment 
mixtures.  The objective of the present invention is to provide a glass 
fiber reinforced thermoplastic molding material colored with an 
inorganic pigment, which does not possess the aforementioned 
problems and which is superior in terms of good coloring 
properties and of good physical properties such as tensile 
strength and impact strength. The aforementioned problems are solved by a thermoplastic 
PTC resin composition, characterized in that it is a 
thermoplastic PCT resin composition which is reinforced with the 
use of 5-60 wt% glass fiber as against the molding material, and 
that 0.01-20.0 wt% zinc sulfide is used as the pigment. The zinc sulfide pigment pertaining to the present invention 
is a white metal salt and mineral
