<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic valve device (10) is proposed in which an electromagnetically actuated pilot-control valve (12) can be mounted at the end face on a housing (17) of a main control valve (11) of a spool type of construction by means of an undetachable push-in arrangement (16). Two tubular pins (41, 42) have annular beads (45, 46) lying at their outer periphery and having cutting edges (48) and are pushed into location bores (53 to 56) of both housings (17, 28) in such a way as to pass through a parting plane (15), the cutting edges (48) catching in the material of both housings (17, 28) and as a result producing a type of fir-cone connection. Here, the pins (41, 42) assume the function of centring and holding both housings (17, 28) against one another as well as the function of passing through the pressure medium and of sealing and permit an exceptionally compact, cost-effective and easy-to-assemble type of construction of the push-in connection (16), which is suitable in particular for directional control valves of small construction.

Pneumatic valve device, having at least two
housing modules which are fastened to one another and

bear against one another with their flange faces in a
separating plane, and having ducts which pass through

this separating plane and conduct pressure medium, at
least one duct being guided, in the separating plane,

through a hollow pin which projects into both housing
modules in a centring manner and seals off the duct to

the outside, and having means which hold the two housing
modules together, at least two hollow pins (41, 42)

arranged in parallel and spaced apart passing through the
separating plane (15), characterized in that each pin

(41, 42) has, on its outer circumference, at least two
annular beads (45, 46) which are each assigned to one of

the housing modules (11, 12) and on which in each case at
least one cutting edge (48) is formed in such a way that

the cutting edges (48) of the two annular beads (45, 46)
face one another and hook into receiving bores (53-56) of

the two housing modules (11,12), so that the pins (41,
42) take on the function of holding the two housing

modules (11, 12) against one another.
Pneumatic valve device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the two housing modules (11, 12)

are the cuboid housings (17, 28) of a primary control
valve (11) and of an associated pilot control valve (12),

which abut one another with their end flange faces (13,
14).
Pneumatic valve device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the housing module (12) for the 

pilot control valve has, in its housing (28), two solenoids
(34, 35) and an adjusting plunger (26) for actuating

a valve spool (19) in the primary control valve (11).
Pneumatic valve device according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the pins (41, 42) of

essentially tubular design are designed to be
rotationally symmetrical relative to their longitudinal

axis (51) and symmetrical relative to a central transverse
plane (52).
Pneumatic valve device according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the annular bead (45, 46) which is

arranged on the outside of each pin half is designed as
a conical chamfer (47) with a diameter which increases

counter to the insertion direction, which chamfer forms
the cutting edge (48) at its end with the large diameter.
Pneumatic valve device according to one of Claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the pins (41, 42) are of

identical design, and their blind-hole-like receiving
bores (53-56) in the two housing modules (11, 12) each

have half the length of the pin (41, 42).
Pneumatic valve device according to one of Claims
4 to 6, characterized in that the spacing between two

annular beads (45, 46) on one pin (41) is approximately
the same as the outside diameter thereof.
Pneumatic valve device according to one of Claims
1 to 7, characterized in that each half of one pin (60)

is made with two or more cutting edges (48, 62).
Pneumatic valve device according to one of Claims
5 to 8, characterized in that the conical chamfer ends in

a cylindrical collar (66) which forms the cutting edge
(48) (Figure 4) .
Pneumatic valve device according to one of Claims
1 to 9, characterized in that the pin (41, 42) consists

of a harder material than the housing material of the
housing modules (11, 12).
Pneumatic valve device according to Claim 10,
characterized in that the pin (41, 42) is made of steel.
Pneumatic valve device according to Claim 10 or
11, characterized in that the housings (17, 28) of the 

two housing modules (11, 12) are made of plastic and/or
aluminium.
Pneumatic valve device according to Claim 12,
characterized in that the housings (17, 28) of the two

housing modules (11, 12) have an approximately equally
large rectangular cross-section and abut one another at

the ends with flat flange faces (13, 14), and in that the
two pins (41, 42) are arranged on both sides of the valve

spool (19) or of the adjusting plunger (26), the said
adjusting plunger (26) being located, in particular, in

the housing (17) of the pilot control valve (11).
