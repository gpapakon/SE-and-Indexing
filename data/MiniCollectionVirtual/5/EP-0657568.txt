<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnet-striker bar system for the control device of a 
rotary dobby comprising an amagnetic container (13) of extremely rigid 

box structure into which the iron cores (14) of the electromagnets are 
equidistantly inserted and irreversibly locked, on the 

electromagnet pole pieces (14') there being mounted 
amagnetic spools (18) for 

supporting the electrical windings (19), said container (13) 
being provided 

in that side further from the hinging axis (2) of said striker bars (1) 
with a longitudinal groove (11) into which are inserted the amagnetic 

support and slide shoulders (10) for the free ends (1'') of the 
striker bars hardened by heat treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new electromagnet-striker bar system 
for a rotary dobby control device which, by considerably reducing 
wear between the ferrous material striker bars and the relative 
amagnetic support and slide shoulders and always ensuring a 
constant optimum predetermined value for the air gap between the 
electromagnets and said striker bars, results not only in large 
constructional economy but also in considerable operational safety 
and reliability with time, as required by modern high-speed rotary 
dobbies. More precisely, the invention relates to an improvement in the 
electromagnet packs used in the two identical control units of the 
rotary dobby control device, as described in the preceding European 
patent application publication No. 0525862 in the name 
of the present applicant. As known from said application, each control unit comprises a set 
of striker bars of ferrous material equal in number to the number 
of main crank arms in the dobby, which can be twenty or more in 
number, each bar being urged by its individual spring against an 
accompanying arm which rotates it from a first position in which  
 
it cooperates with the control pusher of its individual operating 
unit to a second position in which it cooperates with its 
individual electromagnet energized in accordance with a 
predetermined program; all the striker bars are hinged at one of 
their ends to their individual arm projecting from a single shaft 
which rocks them in a direction perpendicular to this shaft. To 
prevent this rocking of the bars causing undesirable sliding or 
deleterious contact of the bars against their electromagnets when 
the bars are retained in said second position by the respective 
energized electromagnets, each striker bar, when in said second 
position, is in contact with an amagnetic support and slide 
shoulder interposed between the pole pieces of the electromagnets 
in order to create a very small air gap between said bar and the 
relative electromagnet. In this known construction problems have arisen due substantially 
to too rapid wear of the sliding region between each striker bar 
and the relative amagnetic shoulder and to the considerable 
difficulty of maintaining all the striker bars attracted by the 
relative electromagnets as far as a precise and very small 
distance from the pole pieces of said electromagnets. In this respect, as the amagnetic support and slide shoulders are 
made to act centrally between the pole pieces of each 
electromagnet, there is no possibility

An electromagnet-striker bar system for the control device 
of a rotary dobby comprising a set of striker bars of ferrous 

material which are hinged at one of their ends to their individual 
arm projecting from a single shaft which rocks them and which are
