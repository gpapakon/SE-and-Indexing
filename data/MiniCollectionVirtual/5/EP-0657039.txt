<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a paper white PDLC system, the use thereof and
incorporation thereof in an electropical LC system and computer or notepad.The invention further relates to a PDLC film with enhanced backscattering.The preparation of PDLC (= polymer dispersed liquid crystal) films is described,
for example, in US 4,688,900, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. Nonlin. Optic,
157, 1988, 427-441, WO 89/06264 and EP 0,272,585. In the so-called
PIPS technology (= polymerization-induced phase separation) the liquid
crystal mixture is first homogeneously mixed with monomers and/or oligomers
of the matrix-forming material; phase-separation is then induced by
polymerization, and one can differentiate between radical PIPS, in particular
photoradical PIPS, and non-radical (for example, thermally induced) PIPS.
Differentiation must further be made between TIPS (temperature-induced
phase separation) and SIPS (solvent-induced phase separation) (Mol. Cryst.
Liq. Cryst. Inc. Nonlin. Opt. 157 (1988) 427) both being also methods to
produce PDLC films.The process of preparation must be controlled very carefully in order to obtain
systems with good electrooptical properties. F.G. Yamagishi et al., SPIE
Vol. 1080, Liquid Crystal Chemistry. Physics and Applications, 1989, p. 24
differentiate between a "Swiss cheese" and a "polymer ball" morphology. In
the latter one. the polymer matrix consists of small polymer 
particles or "balls" being connected or merging into each other while in the
Swiss cheese system, the polymer matrix is continuous and exhibits well
defined, more or less spherical voids containing the liquid crystal. The Swiss
cheese morphology is preferred because it exhibits a reversible electrooptical
characteristic line while the polymer ball system shows a distinct hysteresis
generally leading to a drastic deterioration of the electrooptical characteristic
line when comparing the virgin and the second run.According to Yamagishi et al., loc. cit., the Swiss cheese morphology is
promoted in case the polymerization reaction runs via a step mechanism, and
in WO 89/06264 it is pointed out that the step mechanism is favoured in
case the precursor of the polymer matrix consists of multifunctional acrylates
and multifunctional mercaptanes.Another important point which can be influenced by a careful selection of
process parameters such as curing temperature, relative concentration and
choice of the components of the prepolymer etc., is the mean size of the
microdroplets. Generally, relatively small microdroplets cause
