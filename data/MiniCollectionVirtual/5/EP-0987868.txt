<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to navigation of the Internet by a two-way
interactive communication mobile device capable of wireless communication, via a

link server (300), with service providers or network servers on the Internet. After
the mobile device has established a communication session with the link server

over a wireless network (308), a control engine 320 in the link server is initiated
and uses the computing resources of the link server device so as to be responsible

for tasks that require considerable computing power and memory. such as
processing of URL requests, interpretation of markup language files, management

of data cache and variable states. Working with a message processor (315) in the
server device, the control engine communicates with an interface engine in the

mobile device using a compact data format that is efficiently transportable in the
wireless data network. The interface engine typically performs tasks that do not

require considerable computing power and memory, such as receiving input data
from users, and the rendering of the compact data format received from the link

server device, to cause the mobile device to display contents in the markup
language files on a display screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Patent Application
No. 08/570,210 entitled "METHOD AND ARCHITECTURE FOR AN INTERACTIVE
TWO-WAY DATA COMMUNICATION NETWORK" by Alain Rossmann, one of the
co-inventors hereof.A portion of the present disclosure contains material subject to copyright
protection. Such material includes, but is not limited to, an Appendix entitled
"lmp Specification protocols between Femto Engine and Terminal". The copyright
owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent
document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark
Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights
whatsoever.This invention relates generally to data communications, and in particular to
interactive two-way communication mobile devices that permit a user to 
interact with a network server providing hypermedia information through a data
network. Such a data network can include, for example, the Internet and a
wireless network. The mobile devices may include cellular telephones, a two-way
pagers, or a palm-sized computing devices and typically have limited computing
resources.The Internet is a rapidly growing communication network of interconnected
computers and computer networks around the world. Together, these connected
computers form a vast repository of multimedia information that is readily
accessible by the connected computers from anywhere at any time. To navigate a
portion of the Internet organized as the "World Wide Web", the connected
computers, e.g., workstations and desktop computers, typically utilize a user
interface called a "browser". A browser is a client application program that
generally requests multimedia information residing on the Internet using, typically,
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). A computer which operates a browser
using HTTP is generally a relatively powerful computer with sufficient computing
resources, such as processing power, memory, a display capability and a user
interface.To provide mobility and portability of access to the Internet, interactive
two-way communication mobile devices capable of communicating, via wireless
data networks, with the Internet have been introduced. The interactive two-way
communication mobile devices (e.g., two-way pagers, cellular phones, palm-sized
computing devices and personal digital assistants (PDAs)) are among the fastest
emerging communication devices. These devices enable users to receive, collect,
analyse, review and disseminate

with a network server, the method comprising:-

initiating a control engine in a link server device of a landnet after the mobile
device establishes a communication session with the link server device over the

wireless network, wherein the link server device comprises an account manager
configured to manage a user account of the mobile device; and a message

processor configured to receive a message from the network server over the
landnet;
associating the control engine with an interface engine operating in the
mobile device corresponding to the user account; and
operating the message processor to convert the message to a compact data
file that can be efficiently transported in the wireless network.
