<ABSTRACT>
An endoscope has a fiber optic scope assembly and a 
probe (12), through which illuminating optic fibers (30) pass, along 

with an image guide. The probe also contains a surgery 
tool (34) which can be selectively extended from the outer end 

of the probe or retracted into the probe. The probe can 
also contain passageways (46,47) for the flow of irrigating fluid 

into or out of the treatment area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part patent application of 
co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/093368, 
filed on July 16, 1993, and entitled "Endoscope with 
Integral Tool." The present invention relates to medical diagnostic 
and treatment devices. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to hand held endoscopes used to examine 
and treat an internal area of a patient. Historically, diagnosis and treatment of an internal 
organ or a bone joint of a patient often required the 
performance of significantly invasive surgery on the 
patient. More recently, techniques and equipment have been 
developed which allow the internal examination of these 
areas through the use of endoscopy, a much less invasive 
procedure. The endoscope includes a slender probe which 
contains an imaging device. The imaging device is 
connected through the probe to an eyepiece or a video 
display screen. Endoscopy involves the insertion of the 
probe into the joint or other area to be examined, followed 
by examination of the area either through an eyepiece or on 
a video display screen. It is also now possible to perform relatively non-invasive 
surgery by insertion of a slender cutting tool 
through a separate incision into the area to be treated, 
followed by performance of the necessary surgery with the 
cutting tool. The surgery is viewed in progress by the 
physician through an endoscope as described above for the 
examination procedure. Viewing can be either through an 
eyepiece or on a video display screen. This procedure requires two entry points into the area 
to be treated, one for the endoscope, and one for the 
cutting tool. Even though the entry incisions are 
relatively small, they result in some residual soreness of  
 
the area, and they constitute some risk of infection, 
either from the instrument or from post-operative 
contamination. Additionally, the insertion of multiple 
instruments into a joint or other area, and the subsequent 
manipulation of those instruments will result in some 
internal trauma to the patient, which is unavoidable. Further, the insertion and manipulation of multiple 
instruments can be awkward for the physician, and it may be 
difficult to maneuver the endoscope to effectively view the 
operations being performed by the cutting tool. This 
awkwardness is especially detrimental if the surgery tool 
being used has a cutting contour that is always exposed, 
subjecting the surrounding tissue to possible inadvertent 
lacerations. Finally, endoscopes and cutting tools that

<CLAIMS>
A hand held endoscope for examination and treatment of an internal 
structure of a patient, comprising: 

   a rigid probe having a proximal end and a distal end; 
   illuminating means fixedly mounted within said probe, for 

illumination of the internal structure of the patient; 
   viewing means fixedly mounted on said probe, for viewing the 

internal structure of the patient; 
   treatment means slidably mounted within said probe for treatment 

of the internal structure of the patient, said treatment means being slidable 
relative to said probe to selectively extend a portion of said treatment 

means from an opening on said distal end of said probe; and 
   manipulating means attached to said probe, for manipulation of said 

probe. 
A hand held endoscope according to claim 1, wherein said 
illuminating means comprises: 

   a first optical fiber fixedly mounted within said probe and extending 
through said probe and terminating at said distal end of said probe; and 

   a light source attached to said endoscope so as to illuminate said 
first optical fiber. 
A hand held endoscope according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
viewing means comprises: 

   a gradient refractive index rod fixedly mounted within said distal 
end of said probe, for gathering light reflected from the internal structure 

to be examined; and 
   a second optical fiber attached to said rod and extending from said 

rod through said proximal end of said probe. 
A hand held endoscope according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein: 

   said treatment means is a surgical knife; and 
   said portion of said treatment means, which can extend from said 

distal end of said probe, is a blade on said surgical knife. 
A hand held endoscope according to claim 4, further comprising 
positioning means for positioning said blade on said surgical knife at a 

selected longitudinal position with respect to said probe to extend a desired 
portion of said blade beyond said distal end of said probe. 
A hand held endoscope according to claim 5, wherein said selected 
longitudinal position of said blade can be chosen at a plurality of 

intermediate positions between a fully extended position and a fully 
retracted position. 
A hand held endoscope according to claim 5 or 6, wherein said 
positioning means comprises: 

   a positioning button movably mounted on said manipulating means 
and attached to said surgical knife so as to move said blade to said 

selected longitudinal position with respect to said probe; and 
   a locking mechanism mounted on said manipulating means and 

connected to said positioning button so as to lock said blade at said 
selected longitudinal
 position. 
A hand held endoscope according to claim 7, wherein: 
   said positioning button is slidably mounted on said manipulating 

means; and 
   said locking mechanism is a ratchet mechanism attached to said 

positioning button. 
A hand held endoscope for examination and treatment of an internal 
structure of a patient, comprising: 

   a rigid, elongated probe having a proximal end and a distal end; 
   a plurality of passageways extending longitudinally through said 

probe from said proximal end to said distal end; 
   a light source attached to said endoscope; 

   an illuminating optical fiber mounted within a first of said 
passageways to transmit light from said light source to said distal end of 

said probe to illuminate the internal structure of the patient; 
   a gradient refractive index rod fixedly mounted at said distal end of 

said probe within said first passageway to gather light reflected from the 
internal structure of the patient; 

   a viewing optical fiber attached to said rod and mounted within said 
first passageway to transmit light from said rod to said proximal end of 

said probe for viewing; 
   a surgical knife, having a proximal end and a distal end, slidably 

mounted within a second of said passageways; 
   a blade on said distal end of said knife; and 

   a positioning button slidably mounted on said endoscope and 
attached to said proximal end of said surgical knife to move said surgical 

knife to a selected longitudinal position with respect to said probe to 
extend a desired portion of said blade beyond said distal end of said 

probe. 
An endoscope according to claim 9, further comprising a plurality 
of illuminating optical fibers mounted within said first passageway through 

said probe. 
An endoscope according to claim 9 or 10, wherein a fluid flows in 
a third of said passageways through said probe, for irrigation of the
