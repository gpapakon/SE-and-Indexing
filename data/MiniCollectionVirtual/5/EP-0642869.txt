<ABSTRACT>
An electrical discharge machine has a workhead (10) which can be traversed laterally out of the working area defined by a clamping plate (23). The workhead (10) has a chuck (11) which is intended not only for electrodes (110) for the machining of a workpiece fastened to a pallet (100) but also for a transport gripper (120). The transport gripper (120) serves to take hold of the pallets (100) and feed them to or discharge them from the working area (23). The electrodes (110) and the pallets (100) are stored in a magazine on a plate changer (30) which is integrated in the machine bed directly next to the working area (23). A CNC system (40) present anyway merely needs to be slightly modified so that the workhead (10) is not only suitable for the machining but is also suitable for changing electrodes (110) and pallets (100). A hitherto conventional, separate robot can thus be completely dispensed with. An exceptionally compact type of construction is also obtained.
