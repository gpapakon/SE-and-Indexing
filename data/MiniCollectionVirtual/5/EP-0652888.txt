<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods are provided for the treatment and diagnosis of Candida infections. In accordance with preferred embodiments, oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs are provided which are specifically hybridizable with at least a portion of a Candida mRNA. Preferred targets are the mRNAs which encode  beta -tubulin, aspartate protease, actin and chitin synthetase, as well as the mRNA's which encode the ribosomal L25 protein, translation elongation factors 1 and 2 (TEF1 and TEF2), the b subunit of ATPase, and cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14 alpha -demethylase (L1A1). The oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs comprise nucleotide units sufficient in identity and number to effect said specific hybridization. In other preferred embodiments, the oligonucleotides are specifically hybridizable with a transcription initiation site, a translation initiation site, 5'-untranslated sequences, 3'-untranslated sequences, 5'-cap, and intron/exon junct ion of the mRNAs. Methods of treating animals suffering from Candida infection are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITION OF CANDIDAFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to diagnostics, research reagents, and therapies for Candida infections. In particular, this invention relates to antisense oligonucleotide interactions with certain Candida messenger ribonucleic acids. Specifically, antisense oligonucleotides are designed to hybridize to the Candida mRNA's which encode the /3-tubulin, actin, chitin synthetase and aspartate protease proteins. Other antisense oligonucleotides are designed to hybridize specifically to the Candida mRNA's which encode the ribosomal L25 pr. ein, translation elongation factors 1 and 2 (TEFl and TEF2) , the b subunit of ATPase, and cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14α- demethylase (L1A1) . These oligonucleotides have been found to lead to the modulation of the activity of the Candida RNA or DNA, and thus to the modulation of the Candida infection. Palliation and therapeutic effect result. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts represent an increasingly important cause of mortality and morbidity. Candida species are among the mosr. common of the fungal pathogens with Candida albicans as the most common species, but with Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glahrata (Torulopsis glahrata) and Candida parapsilosis also found in infected individuals. Candida is responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections. For a general review of the types & severity 

of Candida infections see Heunier, F. , Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol . Infect. Dis. 8:438-447 (A89) or Radentz, W. , J. Am. Aσa . Derm. 20:989-1003. Cancer patients, particularly leukemia patients, are at high risk of Candida infections. Up to 30% of all leukemia patients show evidence of invasive candidiasis upon autopsy. Cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors also are at risk of opportunistic infection. Improvements in the treatment of cancer, with greater use of surgery and newer chemotherapies, has resulted in increasing numbers of non-terminal patients becoming infected with Candida and requiring treatment.Another group at risk for Candida and other opportunistic infections is the AIDS population. In AIDS patients Candida is a problem in oropharyngeal infections. Burn patients, I.V. drug users, persons with catheters and premature neonates are all also susceptible to infection by Candida.Candida can also be problematic in the non- immunocompromised host. In normal healthy women, Candida is responsible for vulvovaginitis. The overwhelming majority of yeasts which infect the vagina
