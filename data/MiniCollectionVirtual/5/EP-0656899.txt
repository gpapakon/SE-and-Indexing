<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I) and salts and metabolically labile esters thereof; wherein R is a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing heteroaryl group, which heteroaryl group optionally contains 1 or 2 additional heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur and said heteroaryl group is linked to the alkylene chain (CH2)n via a nitrogen atom in the heteroaryl group; n is an integer from 2 to 4, to processes for their preparation and to their use as antibacterial agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONDENSED CARBAPENEM DERIVATIVESThis invention relates to heterocylic compounds having antibacterial activity, to processes for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in medicine.In EPA No. 0416953A2 there is described 10-(1-hydroxyethyl)-11-oxo-1 - azatricyclo[7.2.0.0.3-8]-undec-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, and 4 substituted derivatives thereof, and salts and esters thereof, which compounds have antibacterial activity.In EPA No. 0422596A2 there is described inter alia 10-(1-hydroxyethyl)-11 -oxo- 1 -azatricyclo[7.2.0.0.3-8]-undec-2-ene-2-carboxyiic acid and derivatives thereof and salts and metabolically labile esters thereof as having antibacterial activity.We have now discovered a novel group of 4-substituted 10-(1-hydroxyethyl)-11 - oxo-1 -azatricyclo[7.2.0.0.3-8]-undec-2-ene-2-carboxylic acids and salts thereof which have useful antibacterial activity.According to the present invention, therefore we provide compounds of general formula (I)(I) salts and metabolically labile esters thereof; wherein R is a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing heteroaryl group which heteraryl group optionally contains 1 or 2 additional heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur and said heteroaryl group is linked to the alkylene chain (CH2)n via a nitrogen atom in the heteroaryl group: 

n is an interger from 2 to 4.In addition to the fixed stereochemical arrangement as defined in formula (I) the molecule contains a further asymmetric carbon atom at the 8-position, and another at the 4-position. It will be appreciated that all stereoisomers including mixtures thereof arising from tnese additional asymmetric centres, are within the scope of the compounds of formula (I).Salts of compounds of formula (I) include base addition salts for use in medicine such salts are formed with bases that have a physiologically acceptable cation. Suitable cations include those of alkali metals (e.g. sodium or potassium), alkaline earth metals (e.g. calcium), amino acids (e.g. lysine and arginine) and organic bases (e.g. procaine, phenylbenzylamine, dibenzylethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and N-methyl glucosamine).Salts derived from bases wherein the cation is not physiologically acceptable may be useful as intermediates for the preparation and/or isolation of other compounds of the invention, and these salts also form part of the invention.When the group R contains a basic centre, acid addition salts of such compounds and internal salts formed with the carboxylic acid grouping are also
