<ABSTRACT>
For fastening working elements (7), such as carding elements, in relation to a rotating fibre-opening roller (1), such as a licker-in roller, it is proposed that the working elements be fastened on the bearing bushes (4) of the roller by means of an attachment (6) which at least partially surrounds the bearing bush.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for attaching working elements, in 
particular a fixed carding element (7), with respect to 

a rotating fibre-opening roller (1), characterized in 
that the working element (7) is attached on the bearing 

bushes (4) of the roller (1) by means of a cap (6) 

encompassing at least partially the bearing bush in 
such a way that the position of the working element 

with respect to the roller is determined exactly. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the cap (6) is made in one piece either with 

the bearing bush (4) or the working element (7). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cap (6) is attached by means of 

surfaces either to the bearing bush (4) or to the 
working element (7). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the cap (6) is arranged at least partially 

prismatically. 
An apparatus as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the working element (6) comprises a 

fixed carding element consisting of a carrier (8) and 
at least one combing insert (9). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3 and 5, characterized 
in that the caps (6) are attached by means of 

bearing surfaces to the bearing bushes (4) and that the 
bearing surface of the combing insert (9) lies in the 

same plane as does the bearing surface of the carrier 
(8) on the bearing bushes (4) or in a plane exactly 

parallel to the same.  
 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the carrier (8) is made of a profile 

with hollow chambers (10). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5,6 or 7, characterized 
in that a separating knife (11) is also attached 

to the carrier (8), with the exact position of 
the tip of the knife being adjustable with respect to 

the roller (1). 
An apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the roller (1) is the 

licker-in of a card.
