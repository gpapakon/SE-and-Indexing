<ABSTRACT>
Prodn. of refractory C-bound mouldings comprises moulding a mixt. of refractory Al2O3-rich material and/or SiC, calcined alumina and a carbonaceous binder, heat treating and impregnating with carbonaceous material. The novelty is that 3-10 wt% modified maize starch as carbonaceous binder, and 0.1-1 wt% C-fibres are used.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing refractory, carbon-bonded 
shaped bodies for wear parts in the pouring of molten 

steel, particularly in the form of a nozzle, discharge 
and plates for sliding gate valves, in which a mixture 

with refractory, granular Al
2
O

-rich material and/or 
silicon carbide, calcined alumina and a carbon-containing 

bonder is shaped, heat treated and possibly impregnated 
with carbon-containing material, characterised in that 3 

- 10 wt.% modified maize starch, constituting the carbon-containing 
bonder and 0.1 - 1 wt.% carbon fibres are 

used, in each case with respect to the amount of the dry, 
refractory material. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that modified maize starch is used with a low molecular 

weight (molar mass less than 2000). 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that modified maize starch is used with a high molecular 

weight (above 100,000). 
A method as claimed in claim 2 and 3, characterised 
in that modified maize starch with a molar mass less than 

2000 and modified maize starch with a molar mass above 
100,000 are used in the weight ratio of 50 - 90 : 10 - 

50%. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that an addition of 0.2 - 0.5 wt.% carbon fibres is used. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that an addition of 0.5 - 2 wt.% soot is used.  

 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that an addition of 1 - 5 wt.% elemental, fine grained 

silicon and/or 0.5 - 5 wt.% fine grained aluminium is 
used. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the bodies shaped from the mixture are dried before 

impregnation with tar at 130 - 150Â°C.
