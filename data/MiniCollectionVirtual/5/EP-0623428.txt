<ABSTRACT>
In the casing (3) of a percussively operating pneumatic tool there is axially displaceably mounted a cylinder unit (1) which is equipped with a piston (17) driven in linearly oscillating fashion. In the front end of the cylinder unit a percussive tool (14-16) is releasably fixed. The rear end of the cylinder unit (1) is supported in a compliant manner by an elastically resilient damping member (8).   In order to provide such a tool with measures ensuring an improved vibration reduction over a wider range of exciting frequencies, according to the invention a damping device (2, 4, 5, 32) with a pressure chamber (2) arranged between the casing (3) and the cylinder unit (1) is additionally provided at the front end of the cylinder unit (1).
