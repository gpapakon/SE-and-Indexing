 Immunostlmulatlng swainsonine analogsFIELD OF INVENTION 5 The invention relates to processes for the production of swainsonine analogs known in general terms as indolizidine compounds and products thereof.BACKGROUND OF TH 1 TNVΕNTTON10 Swainsonine, 1, (the general structure of which is presented in Figure 1) is an alkaloid of molecular weight 173.1 which may be derived from both natural and synthetic sources. Swainsonine is a competitive inhibitor of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (Molyneux, R.J. et al.. Science (Wash.15 DC) 216:190 (1981); Tulsiani, D.R.P. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:7936 (1982)), an enzyme important in the oligosaccharide processing pathway leading to the synthesis of complex membrane oligosaccharides and secreted glycoproteins. This action, as well as the immunomodulatory effects of20 swainsonine, accounts in part for antimetastatic and antineoplastic activity in murine tumor model systems. Swainsonine has also been shown to mediate a diverse array of effects, which include inhibition of tumor growth (Dennis et al., J. Nat'l. Cancer Inst . , 81:1028 (1989)) and25 metastasis (White et al., Anticancer Res., 10:1515 (1990)), synergistic with poly-IC and interleukin-2 (J.W. Dennis, Mt. Sinai Hospital, European Patent Application 87308605.2); augmentation of natural killer (Inamura et al. , J. Antibiot. Tokyo, 38:936 (1985)) and macrophage (Newton et al.. Cancer30 Commun., 1:373 (1989)) tumoricidal activity; induction of cytokine synthesis and secretion (Newton et al.. Cancer Commun., 1:373 (1989)); enhancement in expression of lak t> (Newton et al.. Cancer Commun., 1:373 (1989)) and HLA class 1 specific antigens (White et al., Anticancer Res., 10:151535 (1990)); activation of protein kinase C (Breton et al.. Cancer Commun., 2:333 (1990)); stimulation (5-10 fold increase) of bone marrow (BM) proliferation (White et al.. 

 Cancer Commun,, 3:83 (1991)); engraftment efficiency, and colony- orming unit activity (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E) as assessed by both in vivo and in vitro assays. Swainsonine has also been shown to confer protection against toxicity induced by high dose chemotherapy, to stimulate BM cell proliferation, and to accelerate recovery of BM cellularity when used in combination with chemical agents commonly used in treatment of human malignancies, (J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 83:1125, 1991) . Published European Patent Application 0 104 826 also discloses swainsonine; moreover, it indicates therapeutic dosages and how they are determined for use in treating diseases accompanied by
