<ABSTRACT>
Described is a film forming method for a 
polypropylene resin composition, which comprises subjecting 

a polypropylene resin composition composed of 5 
to 95 parts by weight of a syndiotactic polypropylene 

and 95 to 5 parts by weight of an isotactic polypropylene 
to air-cooled tubular film extrusion. By the 

air-cooled method which has heretofore had difficulty 
in obtaining a highly-transparent film from conventional 

isotactic polypropylene, a film having excellent 
transparency can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tubular film extrusion 
method for easily forming a polypropylene film 
having excellent transparency and surface gloss. In general, isotactic polypropylene is economical 
and excellent in mechanical properties, heat 
resistance, hygienic suitability and water-vapor-permeation 
resistance and when molded, provides good 
external appearance, so that it has been used widely 
for various applications. Tubular polypropylene films are economical and 
excellent in transparency, rigidity, moistureproofness 
and heat resistance so that they are now used widely 
for various packaging materials. Recently, it was found by J.A. Ewen et al. that 
polypropylene having such high tacticity as exceeding 
0.7 in terms of syndiotactic pentad fraction can be obtained 
using a catalyst composed of aluminoxane and a  
 
transition metal compound having an asymmetric ligand 
(J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 110, 6255-6, 1988). Compared 
with conventional isotactic polypropylene, this 
syndiotactic polypropylene is extremely high in transparency 
and surface gloss and is also excellent in 
flexibility. The syndiotactic polypropylene is hence 
expected to develop new application fields to which the 
conventional isotactic polypropylene cannot be applied. 
It, however, has not been produced yet on an industrial 
scale because of some problems unsolved in processability 
or the like. For the excellent properties described above, 
syndiotactic polypropylene is expected to develop a new 
application as soft transparent films. It is known 
that for the formation of the syndiotactic 
polypropylene, a conventional method for the formation 
of an isotactic polypropylene film, for example, T-die 
extrusion or water-quenching tubular-film extrusion 
method (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 81130/1991) can 
be employed. Isotactic polypropylene films, on the other hand, 
are used for a wide variety of applications because 
they are economical and have excellent rigidity, 
moisture-proofness and heat resistance. To improve the 
problem of insufficient transparency, a crystalline  
 
propylene-ethylene copolymer is employed in combination 
with isotactic polypropylene. Films available even 
from such a copolymer are however still insufficient in 
transparency, leading to a desire for further improvements. When such an isotactic propylene homopolymer or 
copolymer is formed by the tubular film extrusion method, 
it is generally necessary to cool the resulting 
film with water, namely, quench it so that the crystallinity 
of the
