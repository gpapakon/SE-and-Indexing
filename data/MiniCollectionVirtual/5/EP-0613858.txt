<ABSTRACT>
In the process for the preparation of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate having good fluoride (fluorine) compatibility and hydrolytic stability, which effects further thickening which is as low as possible when it is used in toothpastes, by reaction of calcium carbonate suspended in water with an aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid, precipitation of dimagnesium phosphate trihydrate as stabiliser by reaction of aqueous solutions of a magnesium salt and of orthophosphoric acid in the presence of a basic compound, and also subsequent filtration, drying and milling of the precipitate, there is added to the reaction mixture as further stabiliser from 0.2 to 0.8 % by weight of polyphosphoric acid, calculated on the basis of the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate precipitated in the reaction mixture.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of dicalcium phosphate 
dihydrate, which has a good compatibility with 

fluorine and stability to hydrolysis and causes the 
minimum possible after-thickening when used in 

toothpastes, by reaction of calcium carbonate 
suspended in water with an aqueous solution of 

orthophosphoric acid in a first precipitating stage, 
precipitation of dimagnesium phosphate trihydrate, 

as a stabilizer, by reaction of aqueous solutions of 
a magnesium salt and of orthophosphoric acid in the 

presence of a basic compound in a second 
precipitating stage, and final filtering, drying and 

grinding of the precipitate, which comprises adding 
to the reaction mixture 0.2 to 0.8 % by weight of 

polyphosphoric acid, calculated with respect to the 
dicalcium phosphate dihydrate precipitated in the 

reaction mixture, as a further stabilizer, the 
polyphosphoric acid being employed in the second 

precipitating stage towards the end of the 
precipitation of dimagnesium phosphate trihydrate. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein polyphosphoric 
acid with a phosphorus content 

corresponding to 78 % by weight of phosphorus 
pentoxide is employed. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
approximately stoichiometric amounts of the calcium 

carbonate suspension and the orthophosphoric acid  
 

solution are introduced into a reaction vessel and 
the reaction is kept at temperatures which do not 

exceed 50Â°C in a pH range of 2.2 to 2.6; wherein the 
pH range of the reaction mixture is increased to 5.6 

to 5.8 with sodium hydroxide solution and 
dimagnesium phosphate trihydrate is precipitated in 

an amount of 2 to 4 % by weight, calculated with 
respect to the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate 

precipitated in the reaction mixture, at a pH of 5.6 
to 6.0 while simultaneously introducing 

stoichiometric amounts of aqueous solutions of 
magnesium salt, orthophosphoric acid and sodium 

hydroxide solution; wherein 0.2 to 0.8 % by weight 
of polyphosphoric acid, calculated with respect to 

the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate precipitated in 
the reaction mixture, is added to the reaction 

mixture towards the end of this precipitation, the 
reaction mixture is subsequently stirred for 2 to 

3 minutes and the pH is simultaneously brought to 
the neutral point with sodium hydroxide solution; 

and wherein the precipitated product is separated 
off from the reaction mixture, dried and comminuted 

to the particle size customary for use in 
toothpastes. 
The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
stoichiometric amount of orthophosphoric acid to be 

introduced in the second precipitating stage is 
reduced in accordance with the equivalent acidity of 

the amount of polyphosphoric acid to be added. 
The process as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the reaction vessel is 

provided with a double jacket for the purpose of 
cooling.
