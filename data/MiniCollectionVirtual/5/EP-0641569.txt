<ABSTRACT>
An antipruritic containing as the active ingredient a leucotriene C₄ or D₄ antagonist, in particular, 8-[p-(4-phenylbutoxy)benzoyl]amino-2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran 

represented by the formula (I), a harmless salt thereof, or a 
hydrate thereof. It is useful for treating pruritis, especially, one accompanying hemodialysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to treating agents for pruritus cutanea 
containing, as active ingredient, antagonists of leukotriene C₄ or D₄ 
(abbreviated as LTC₄ and LTD₄, respectively, hereafter) As patients who continually undergo hemodialysis, increase with the 
progress of hemodialysis therapy, various complications thereof have 
become an issue. Especially, one of the complications which the patients 
have suffered, is pruritus cutanea. Severe itching attacks the patients not only 
on dialysis but day and night. They have their attention distracted and are 
unable to get themselves to work at daytime, and they are unable to sleep at 
night. They often have rash. Examples of original diseases which lead to hemodialysis therapy 
include mainly chronic glomerulonephritis, diabetes, and additionally 
nephrosclerosis, cystic kidney, kidney disorders accompanying various 
systemic diseases. It is said that pruritus cutanea appears in 80 to 90 % of 
patients in hemodialysis. It is considered that pruritus cutanea is induced by various factors, but 
the mechanism is still unclear. Until now, various therapies such as administration of antihistamines, 
antiallergic agents, steroid ointment, radiation of ultraviolet rays, change of 
hemocatharsis etc., have been carried out, but are not fully efficacious. Further, 
there is the problem that antihistamines and antiallergic agents induce side 
effects in digestive system or drowsiness.  On the other hand, LTC₄ and LTD₄ are physiologically active 
substances which are released from cell membranes. They were found as a 
member of the prostaglandin family in 1979. Thereafter, it was found that 
LTC₄ and LTD₄ are identical to a substance which had been called slow 
reacting substance (SRS) or SRS-A up to that time. Therefore, it was 
considered that LTC₄ and LTD₄ are important factors which are concerned 
with appearance of allergic bronchial or pulmonary diseases, allergic shock 
and various allergic inflammation. For the purpose of the treatment of such diseases, antagonists 
against LTC₄ and LTD₄ were synthesized and many patent applications on 
various antagonists have been filed until now. However, there is no 
antagonist for the treatment of pruritus cutanea. From the above view point, the present inventors have carried out 
energetic investigation in order to find novel treating agents for pruritus 
cutanea. As a result, we have found that antagonists against LTC₄ or LTD₄ 
are surprisingly effective and have accomplished the present invention. Until now,
