<ABSTRACT>
A retention system for collecting material from a plant is described.   This system comprises at least one drainage line which opens out into at least one flexible container, is connected thereto in a substantially pressure-tight manner, is fitted with a pressure relief safeguard, and serves to relieve pressure and drain material from the plant. In this case, the flexible container must be dimensioned at least to ensure that it has such an internal volume in the filled state that the internal pressure of the connected system consisting of the drainage line and the flexible container virtually corresponds to the external pressure. Furthermore, a method for preventing the escape of material from a plant into the surroundings is described. This method comprises the steps:   a) draining the material from the plant by means of at least one drainage line which serves to relieve pressure and drain material from the plant, b) feeding the material into at least one flexible container which is connected to the drainage line, the flexible container being selected such that it has at least such an internal volume in the filled state that the internal pressure of the connected system consisting of the drainage line and the flexible container virtually corresponds to the external pressure and c) intermediate storage of the material in said flexible container until it can be disposed of in the proper manner.

A retention system for collecting substances from an
apparatus whose internal pressure is at least 0.5

bar above the external pressure and which has at
least one outlet line which opens out into at least

one flexible container and is joined to this and
also a pressure-relief safety device, with the

pressure-relief safety device, the outlet line and
the flexible container or containers being arranged

such that, when the pressure-relief safety device is
activated, substances exiting the apparatus pass

into the flexible container or containers, with the
flexible container or containers being dimensioned

at least so that its internal volume can completely
absorb the amount of substance exiting the

apparatus, without producing an internal pressure
which is more than 3 bar above the external

pressure, and a device for distributing the mass
streams being arranged at the orifice of the outlet

line into the flexible container or containers
and/or in the flexible container or containers.
The retention system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the flexible container is composed of a coated or

uncoated fabric.
The retention system as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the fabric is composed of polyester fibers, in

particular of polyethylene terephthalate fibers. 
The retention system as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the flexible container is cuboid in the filled state

and is produced from fabric webs which are joined
together by welding or sewing.
The retention system as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the flexible container is cylindrical in the filled

state and is produced from fabric webs which are
joined together by welding or sewing.
The retention system as claimed in claim 5, wherein
the cylindrical 
part of the flexible container is
fabricated from fabric webs which run spirally and

are joined together by welding or sewing.
The retention system as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the fabric, to improve the impermeability of the

flexible container for the substances to be
received, is coated with thermoplastic materials or

with elastomers.
The retention system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the flexible container is equipped with at least one

inlet port which can be flanged to the orifice of
the outlet line or can be joined to a flange.
The retention system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the flexible container, in addition to an inlet

port, has other fittings, in particular one or more
valves.
The retention system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
guide elements are mounted at the orifice of at

least one outer side of the flexible container.
The retention system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the flexible container, on the side on which the

inlet port is situated, has loops and/or rings by
which the container can be fixed to a holder. 
The retention system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the flexible container, before collecting the substances,

is present in a folded-up and/or rolled-up
form.
The retention system as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the walls of the flexible container are treated with

a slip additive and/or lubricant, preferably with
talcum.
The retention system as claimed in at least one of
claims 1 to 13, wherein the container or containers

is folded, before the pressure-relief safety device
is activated, such that virtually all pleats occur

at the top side of the container and the bottom side
is virtually pleat-free.
