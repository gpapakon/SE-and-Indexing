<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention concerns a collapsible plastic crate 
(bottle carrier) for carrying 

and storing bottles which has two horizontal inserts (4,5), 
a lower (5) insert with cavities for containing the bottom 

of the bottles and an upper insert (4) with through holes, 
aligned with the circular cavities underneath, in 

order to contain the body of the bottles in a vertical 
position; it being provided that said inserts, fixed 

within a portal (1) supporting structure, are each made up 
of a pair of identical half wings, able to open and 

close simultaneously like a book.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant patent application for an industrial 
invention concerns a foldable crate, made from 
moulding in plastic material, intended to carry and 
store bottles in a tidy manner. The article in question is placed in a field where 
such articles already exist; more particularly, up to 
the present time, bottles have been carried - normally 
six at a time - in an erect position in crates with 
internal divided sectors or in baskets with handles, 
made of plastic or metal. The structure of said crates is composed essentially 
of a base plate with several circular or square 
horizontal cavities, and of a second plate, parallel 
to the first one but in a higher position, with 
through holes perfectly aligned with the 
aforementioned circular cavities positioned on the 
base plate. As is known these crates are used by lowering the 
bottles through the holes on the plate in the higher 
position, until the bottom of the bottles is perfectly 
nested and contained inside the cavities of the base 
plate; while the upper plate serves the purpose of 
containing the body of the bottles, in order to avoid 
any deviation from the vertical position. It should, however, be mentioned that in spite of the 
fact that said crates of the conventional type, 
have proved to be quite adequate, they do nevertheless 
present certain problems.  
 The main problem must surely be the considerable 
physical size of these crates: it can be said, in 
fact, that each of these traditional crates, while 
being practically hollow inside, is the same size as a 
large box, able to contain in height, length and 
width, six bottles in an erect position. If this considerable physical size could be considered 
normal or rather inevitable, when the crates are full 
of bottles, then the same cannot be said of the times 
when, vice-versa, the crates are empty. On these occasions, it would appear to be less 
convenient ( both from the practical and economical 
point of view), to have to waste so much space when 
storing and transporting articles which weigh so 
little. This difficulty emerges both in the case of retailers 
and manufacturers, who have to keep large quantities 
of said crates, as well as in the case of private 
individuals, for whom even the size of just one of 
these articles can create considerable problems, 
particularly in view of the small amount of space 
normally available in modern homes.

<CLAIMS>
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, of the type comprising two inserts one above the 

other (4, 5) sustained with a portal support structure (1), of which 
the upper insert (4) is provided with a series of holes (4a) vertically 

aligned with a corresponding series of cavities (5a) present on the 
lower insert (5), whereby
 
each insert (4, 5) is made up of two pairs of 

rectangular half-wings (4b, 5b) fixed to each other by means of 
three hinges (6), distributed along the internal longitudinal 

symmetry axis of the two inserts (4,5) and which allow each pair of 
half-wings to open and close like a book; and whereby
 
the portal structure (1) is stiffened by two 

crosspieces (1c, 1d), one of which (1c) provided about halfway up 
the uprights (1a) of the portal structure (1), the other at the base;
 
characterised in that one of the half-wings of each pair has at the two 

ends of its internal longitudinal symmetry axis, fixing pins (9a), with 
an inclined tip, lodged within corresponding holes (1f) on the 

internal faces of the uprights (1a) of the portal structure 
immediately above the stiffening crosspieces (1c, 1d); and 

in that along the external face of each of the two uprights (1a) of 
the portal structure (1) there are applied two sliders (2), each of  

 
which has two identical pairs of lugs (2a) extending from opposite 

sides thereof with respective pins (2c) projecting from the inside 
surface of said lugs, inserted into corresponding "S" shaped slots 

(3) positioned on the transversal edges of the half-wings (4b, 5b) of 
the inserts (4, 5). 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that 

the portal structure (1) and the stiffening crosspiece (1c, 1d) have 
a H-shaped transversal section; it being provided that these 

crosspieces (1c, 1d) have a lower horizontal wing which is wider 
than the upper horizontal wing. 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, according to the previous claim, characterised by the 

fact that the aforementioned hinges (6) for the fixing of each pair of 
half-wings (4b) and (5b) are made up of three forks (7), provided on 

the internal longitudinal edge of one half-wing, in co-operation with 
the same number of bolts (8) in a corresponding position on the 

internal longitudinal edge of the other half-wing; it being provided 
that each fork (7) be made up of a pair of fins with a semi-circular 

upper section, which are provided on their internal face, with 
respective pins on the horizontal axis (7a), with the tip shaped like 

the mouth of a flute, inserted within the holes (8a) of the 
corresponding "U" bolt (8), which is also provided with a semi-cylindrical 

upper section. 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 

tidy manner, according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that 
the pins (9a) for the fixing of the inserts (4, 5) to the uprights (1a) of 

the portal structure (1) protrude from the external surface of lugs 
(9), elastically flexible, provided at the two ends of the internal 

longitudinal edge of the half-wings provided with the 
aforementioned forks (7).  

 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that 

the manoeuvring sliders (2) have a "U"-shaped transversal section 
which allows them to precisely embrace from the outside the H-shaped 

section of the uprights (1a); said sliders (2) are firmly 
blocked due to the fact that there are provided cuneiform teeth 

(2d) on the internal face of their opposite edges, which are locked 
within the vertical grooves of the uprights (1a). 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that 

the internal edge of the holes (4a) of the upper insert (4) and the 
edges of the cavities (5a) of the lower insert (5) are flared. 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, according to claim 1), characterised by the fact that 

the sliders (2) have a gripping nib (2b) at the top, below a counter-nib 
(1e) made in moulding on the external side of the uprights (1a) 

of the portal structure (1). 
Foldable plastic crate for carrying and storing bottles in a 
tidy manner, according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that 

along the crosspiece (1b) of the portal structure (1) there is applied 
a handle (10), made up of two semi-cylindrical shells with internal 

projections (10a) destined to be lodged within slots provided on the 
vertical wing of a H-shaped section of the crosspiece (1b).
