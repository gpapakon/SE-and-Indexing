<ABSTRACT>
A wobble plate (10) in a wobble plate compressor (1) has a 
bevel gear (101) positioned at a 

central portion thereof. The bevel gear (101) is provided with a centered 
ball seat. A second 

bevel gear (111) is supported on the cylinder block (21) and also has a 
centered ball seat. A 

bearing ball (12) is seated in both of the ball seats so that the wobble 
plate (10) nutates about the 

ball (12). At least one of the bevel gears (101,111) is coated with 
electroless composite plating layer 

having a self-lubricative material, such as polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE), dispersed 

therein. Consequently, the bevel gears (101,111) have low frictional 
resistance, high hardness and improved anti-seizure characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a wobble plate type refrigerant 
compressor and, more particularly, to a thrust ball supporting mechanism for a wobble 
plate type compressor. A thrust support mechanism of the wobble plate type refrigerant compressor is 
well known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,870,893 to Takahashi discloses a refrigerant 
compressor wherein the rotation of the compressor drive shaft is converted into 
reciprocating motion through a cam rotor. The cam rotor has a sloping end surface and 
is mounted on an end of the drive shaft. A wobble plate bears against the cam rotor 
through needle bearings, and is supported on a fixed member such as a cylinder block 
in such a manner that the wobble plate nutates, but does not rotate. Thus, the rotation 
of the cam rotor causes wobble plate to nutate, and the piston rods connected to the 
wobble plate are reciprocated to compress fluid within the cylinders. In a known wobble plate supporting mechanism, a bevel gear is fixed to the 
wobble plate at the center thereof and another bevel gear is fixedly supported on the 
cylinder block. The bevel gears mesh so that the bevel gear on the wobble plate is 
prevented from rotating. Both of the bevel gears have ball seats at their center in which 
a bearing ball sits. Thus, while the bevel gear on the wobble plate is prevented from 
rotating, it nutates along the ball surface. The bearing ball and ball seats on the bevel gears are subjected to some of the 
largest axial loads in the compressor. Accordingly, proper lubrication of these parts is 
imperative. Under normal operating conditions, they are lubricated by a mist of 
lubricating oil generated by the moving parts the compressor. However, in the event 
that the compressor suffers a leakage of lubricating oil or continues to operate when the  
 
level of lubricating oil has decreased below a threshold level, 
the engaging surfaces may not be sufficiently lubricated, 
possibly resulting in abrading of the bearing ball or even 
failure of the compressor. In addition, prior art level gear rotation prevention mechanism 
are substantially rigid bodies. The metal to metal 
contact of the bevel gears has been known to cause considerable 
and undesirable noise and vibration. This in turn can reduce the 
marketability and effective life of the compressor. Document JP-A-4 119 249 discloses bevel gears coated with an 
electroless nickel-plated layer with infused polytetrafluoroethylene 
particles to improve the hardness of the surface. Document JP-A-4
