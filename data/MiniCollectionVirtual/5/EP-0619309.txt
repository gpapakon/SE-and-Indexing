characterized in that the amount of catalyst(s) used is

from 0.05% to 2% in moles per mole of heterocyclic
alcohol of formula (III).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that at least one additional catalyst

is used chosen from dialkyltin oxides, tin dialkyl
dialkoxides and tin dialkyl diesters.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in

characterized in that the reaction is carried out for a

period between 1 and 10 hours, under a pressure which
does not exceed atmospheric pressure.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the

presence of at least one polymerization inhibitor chosen
from phenothiazine, hydroquinone methyl ether, di-tert-butylcatechol,
