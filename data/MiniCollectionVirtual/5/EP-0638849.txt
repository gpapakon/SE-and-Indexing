<ABSTRACT>
A developer composition of the present invention 
contains a toner having at least a binder resin, a 

coloring agent and a toner scum preventive. The binder 
resin contains as a main component a polyester resin or a 

resin produced by concurrently carrying out addition 
polymerization and condensation polymerization in one 

reaction vessel. By using the toner of the present 
invention, since the formation of toner scum on the 

carrier surface can be prevented for a long period of time 
in the service life of the developer while retaining the 

low-temperature fixing ability of the toner, the carrier 
resistance and the triboelectric charge can be stably 

maintained, thereby providing a developer composition with 
a long service life. Accordingly, besides having a long 

service life mentioned above, the developer composition is 
highly suitably used for a high-speed semiconductive 

magnetic development.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a toner in a developer composition for a dry-type, two-component development method wherein electrostatic latent images are developed using image-forming apparatuses such as laser printers and dry-type electrostatic copying machines, and to a developer composition comprising the toner together with specific carrier particles. More particularly, it relates to the use of a toner and a developer composition capable of maintaining carrier resistance and triboelectric charge with substantially no change for a long period of time by reducing the toner scum of the carrier, thereby maintaining high image quality.As described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,221,776, 2,297,691 and 2,357,809 and other publications, the conventional electrophotography using an image-forming apparatus such as a dry-type electrostatic copying machine comprises the steps of evenly charging a photoconductive insulating layer (a charging process); subsequently exposing the layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion so as to form an electrostatic latent image (an exposing process); visualizing the formed image by adhering colored charged fine powder known as a toner to the latent image (a developing process); transferring the obtained visible image to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper (a transfer process); and permanently fixing the transferred image by heating, pressure application or other appropriate means of fixing (a fixing process).As stated above, a toner must meet the requirements not only in the development process but also in the transfer process and fixing process.As suitable development methods for electrophotography, there are basically two kinds, i.e., a dry-type development method and a wet-type development method. In the dry-type development method, there are a method utilizing a one-component system developer and a method utilizing a two-component system developer comprising a toner and a carrier.As methods utilizing two-component system developers, a magnetic brush development utilizing a magnetic powder carrier (see U.S. Patent No. 2,786,439) and a cascade development utilizing a bead carrier with a relatively large particle size (see U.S. Patent No. 2,618,551) have been known, the above method having two different conveying systems of toners.As toners used for such development methods, it has generally known to use fine particles obtained by the steps of mixing and dispersing various functional additives including coloring agents, such as dyes and pigments,
