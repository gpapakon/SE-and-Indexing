<ABSTRACT>
A shift mechanism for shifting multi-ratio gearboxes of motor vehicles is connected to an electric motor which can be connected via a coupling mechanism and a clutch to a shift rod (9) displaceable essentially parallel to the axis of the gears. Depending on the clutch position, the coupling mechanism provides either a rotary connection with the electric motor or conversion of the rotary motion of the electric motor into a translational motion of the shift rod (9). To connect the shift rod (9) to the electric motor is a spindle mechanism. The spindle nut (1) of the spindle mechanism is firmly connected to the rotor (6) of the electric motor or represents part of the rotor (6), and the clutch (13, 23) is arranged between the rotor (6) and the spindle (2) or a part connected firmly in terms of rotation to the spindle, and the coupling mechanism (18) is arranged between the shift rod 9 and the housing (19).

Shift mechanism for multi-ratio gearboxes of motor 
vehicles with an electric motor comprising a rotor (6) and a 

stator (5), said electric motor being capable of being 
connected in the following way to a shift rod (9) which is 

capable of being displaced substantially parallel to the wheel 
axis of the multi-ratio gearbox: 


in a first shift phase the shift rod (9) is rotatably 
connected to the electric motor via a clutch (13) which is 

arranged and interpolated between said shift rod and the rotor 
(6), and 
in a second shift phase the rotary motion of the electric 
motor is converted by means of a spindle device comprising a 

spindle nut (1) and a spindle (2) into a translational 
movement of the shift rod which is rigidly connected to the 

spindle (2), 
characterised in that
the spindle nut (1) is rigidly connected to the rotor (6) of 
the electric motor or constitutes a part of the rotor (6), and 
the clutch (13) is a friction clutch arranged between the 
rotor (6) and the spindle (2) or a part that is connected to 

the spindle in non-rotating manner.
