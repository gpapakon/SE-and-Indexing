<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition comprising 
an aqueous cellulosic furnish, cationic polymer and a modified 
lignin and methods using the composition for making paper or 
paperboard having improved properties in the areas of 
drainage, retention and formation. In the production of paper or paperboard from a 
dilute aqueous cellulosic furnish improvements in retention 
and drainage and in the formation properties of the final 
paper or paperboard sheet are particularly desirable. It is 
well known by those skilled in the art that these parameters 
are frequently in conflict with each other. For example, if  
 
the cellulosic fibers of the aqueous cellulosic furnish are 
flocculated effectively to larger flocs, retention of, for 
example, fiber fines and filler is generally good and can 
result in a porous structure yielding generally good drainage; 
however, formation is poor. In this light, conventional 
practice has resulted in those skilled in the art selecting 
one or more additives to improve the production of paper or 
paperboard according to the parameters that are most important 
to achieve. Alternatively, if the cellulosic fibers are 
flocculated to a lesser degree, drainage and retention are 
less satisfactory; however, formation is improved. Further, 
drainage and retention are often in conflict with each other 
when, for example, increased production of paper or paperboard 
is desired over the need for retention of, such as for 
example, fillers and the like. Retention is believed to be a function of different 
mechanisms such as filtration by mechanical entrainment, 
electrostatic attraction and bridging between aqueous 
cellulosic fibers and filler. Because both cellulose and many 
common fillers are electronegative, they are mutually 
repellant and, in the absence of a retention aid, the only 
factor tending to enhance retention is mechanical entrainment. Drainage relates to the rate at which free water is 
released from a sheet as it is being formed. Thus, it will be 
appreciated that drainage aids improve the overall efficiency 
of dewatering in the production of paper or paperboard. Formation relates to the formation of the paper or 
paperboard sheet produced from the papermaking process. 
Formation is generally evaluated by the variance in light  
 
transmission within a paper sheet. A high variance is 
indicative of poor formation. It is generally well known by 
those skilled in the art that as the retention level 
increases, the level of formation generally decreases from 
good
