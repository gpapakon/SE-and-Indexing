<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC TIME THERMOSTAT WITH A TEMPORARY NEXT PERIOD ADJUSTMENT MEANSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to the field o thermostats and more particularly to thermostats whic modify a setpoint as a function of time.Thermostats are well known devices for control o heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Thermostats which modify the temperature se point as a function of time period, can be found, for example in U.S. patent 4,469,274 (Levine) issued September 4, 1984 and assigned to Honeywell Inc.A problem existed with such time-temperature thermostats in that they would repeat a cycle of setpoint temperatures over and over again. There was no way to presently temporarily modify the setpoint of a period occurring one or more periods later.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a thermostat which allows an operator to modify a future period setpoint. The thermostat repeatedly progresses through a plurality of setpoint periods in which the setpoint varies according to time. An operator may enter a temporary setpoint for use during a selected future period. When a clock in the thermostat reaches the preselected future period, the normal operation of th thermostat program is suspended and the user entered temporary setpoint is employed for control of the HVA system. After the temporary period has expired, the 

 thermostat returns to the normal thermostat operation program.A further enhancement to the invention is the ability to set a temporary now temperature along with a temporary next temperature. Two time-temperature periods are entered into the thermostat, one for present control and one for future control. The normal thermostat operation program is suspended until the first normal change of periods after the temporary next period has begun.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a block diagram of the presently inventive thermostat.Figure 2 is a table showing an exemplary set of temperature setpoint periods.Figure 2A shows an exemplary progression of the periods as run by the thermostat of Figure l.Figure 3 is a flow chart of the method employed in the presently inventive thermostat. Figure 4 is a flow chart of an enhanced version of the inventive method. Figure 4A shows the effect of the method of Figure 4 on the normal program operation.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of the presently inventive thermostat. The thermostat 200 includes data entry means 5, temperature sensor 14, display 15,

CLAIMS
1. A method of selecting a setpoint period in a thermostat, the thermostat capable of having a preprogrammed sequence of setpoint periods, comprising the steps of: controlling to a current period setpoint (305) ; deciding if it is time for a next period setpoint (310); controlling to a temporary next period setpoint
(325) if said temporary next period setpoint has been previously entered into the thermostat by the operator; and controlling to the normal next period setpoint otherwise (320) .
2. A thermostat for controlling the operation of an HVAC system, comprising: a temperature sensor (14) for producing a temperature signal indicative of local temperature; data entry means (5) for entry of data into the thermostat; display means (15) for displaying information related to the thermostat and HVAC system operation; a clock (11) producing a clock signal; and temperature responsive means (10) connected to said data entry means, said temperature sensor, said display, and said clock, said temperature responsive means receiving said temperature and clock signals from said temperature sensor and said clock 


 respectively, said temperature responsive means further having stored therein a plurality of time periods with associated setpoint temperatures, said plurality of time periods rotating on a preselected basis related to said clock signal, said temperature responsive means also having the ability to store a temporary next period setpoint, said temporary next period setpoint being used as the current setpoint when the clock signal indicates that the time for the temporary period setpoint has occurred.
3. The thermostat of claim 2, wherein: said temperature responsive means purges said temporary next period setpoint upon expiring of the next period. 4. A method of controlling a thermostat having a plurality of prestored time-temperature periods, the plurality of time-temperature periods sequencing on a predetermined basis, comprising the steps of: deciding if a temporary current setpoint has been entered (405) ; controlling to said temporary current setpoint (435) if it has been entered, and controlling to a normal current setpoint (415) otherwise; deciding if it is time for a next period setpoint (410) and controlling to a normal next period setpoint
'
 (425) if there is no temporary next period setpoint, and controlling to the temporary next period setpoint (455) otherwise.
