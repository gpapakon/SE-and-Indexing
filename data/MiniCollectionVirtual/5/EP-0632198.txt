<ABSTRACT>
In a spark plug (1) having a fuel injector valve (100), a 
tubular insulator (4) is provided in a cylindrical metallic 

shell (3). A front end of the insulator (4) is fixedly secured in 
the metallic shell (3) and a rear end of the insulator (4) is 

slightly extended beyond the metallic shell (3). A tubular 
center electrode (5) is provided in the axial bore of the 

insulator. An inner space of the center electrode (5) forms a 
fuel passage (11), and a front end the center electrode (5) forms 

a fuel injection nozzle (51). An electromagnetic valve body (54) is 
provided in the fuel passage (11) to open and close the fuel 

injection nozzle (51). An electromagnetic coil (200) is provided in 
a manner to surround the rear end of the insulator (4) to 

actuate the electromagnetic valve body (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spark plug having a fuel 
injector valve. The spark plug and fuel injector valve are 
integrally assembled so as to inject a fuel into a cylinder 
of an internal combustion engine. Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 1-104961 
discloses a fuel injector valve which is provided in a fuel 
passage of a centre electrode of the spark plug. Japanese 
Utility Model Provisional Publication No. 63-183371 
discloses a fuel injector valve having a spark plug. However, the fuel injector valve of the Japanese 
Patent Provisional Publication No. 1-104961 has no means to 
control the duration of valve opening. This poses a 
problem with response. Particularly for a direct injection 
type engine it is desired to quickly terminate fuel 
injection. In the spark plug disclosed in the Japanese 
Utility Model Publication No. 63-183371, there is a 
possibility that malfunction and damage may be incurred 
under the influence of high voltage since the electrical 
insulation between an electromagnetic coil and the high 
voltage applied to the spark plug is not fully considered. US-A-3 980 061 discloses a spark plug 
wherein the coil is provided 
inwardly of an insulator at the top end of the spark plug. 
The centre electrode is also provided inwardly of an 
insulator at the bottom end of the spark plug. According to the present invention there is provided  
 
a spark plug having a fuel injector valve comprising: 
a metallic shell; a columnar insulator having an axial bore and 
provided in the metallic shell, a front end of the 
insulator being fixedly secured in the metallic shell and a 
rear portion of the insulator extending rearwardly beyond 
the metallic shell; a tubular centre electrode provided in the axial bore 
of the insulator, an inner space of the centre electrode 
forming a fuel passage and a front end of the centre 
electrode forming a fuel injection nozzle; a magnetic valve body; and a coil for electromagnetically actuating the magnetic 
valve body;  wherein a rear portion of the electrode 
extends rearwardly beyond the metallic shell, the magnetic 
valve body is provided in the fuel passage to open and 
close the fuel injection nozzle and the coil surrounds the 
rear portion of the insulator and the rear portion of the 
electrode.   There is thus provided a spark plug having a fuel 
injector valve in which the rear portion of the insulator 
effectively shields the coil from the influence of the 
high, spark discharge voltage applied to the centre 
electrode.
