<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polymers the aqueous 
solutions of which have a rheofluidifying behaviour that 

increases with temperature. 
These polymers comprise a water-soluble skeleton 
incorporating segments or bearing side chains having a Lower 

Critical Solution Temperature ("LCST" property).
 

Applications to the chemical and oil industries, in 
particular for their controlled anti-settling properties 

and, most especially, to the field of drilling muds, as well 
as other technical sectors using this property, such as 

cosmetics, the food processing industry or any other 
industry in which there arise problems relating to the 

stability of a suspension in an aqueous solution of solid 
particles having sizes of less than a few millimeters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical 
sector concerned with polymers and, more particularly, 
rheofluidifying polymers and copolymers whose solutions in 
an aqueous medium have a rheofluidifying behaviour that 
increases with temperature. "Rheofluidifying behaviour" designates the 
property whereby measured apparent viscosity decreases when 
the shearing force applied to the fluid becomes stronger. In this context, the expression "increases" means 
that links are associated locally above a certain threshold 
temperature, which causes a physical increase in molecular 
weight which is more or less reduced by the level of 
shearing applied to the solution. As aggregation increases 
with a rise in temperature, the rheofluidifyig nature of 
aqueous solutions is thus all the more marked the higher the 
temperature. As used in this context, the expression 
"increases" will assume these two meanings throughout the 
text. Such products have numerous applications as 
antisettling agents, as components of fracturing fluids or 
drilling or completion fluids, in particular for well 
cementing, in the oil and geothermal industries, or acid 
well treatment, as well as of mobility control agents or 
fluids for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and analogous fluids 
used in the oil industry, such as industrial cleaning fluids 
or aqueous base hydraulic lubricating fluids. The very great majority of these applications take 
place in an aqueous medium. One could, however, upon reading 
the following description, contemplate choosing polymers 
usable in a non-aqueous medium; mention can be made, in 
particular, to gels for industrial cleaning, in an alcohol 
medium, in particular in ethanol. Their field of application 
thus covers a very wide range of industries and their 
potential uses will become clear to a man of the art in the  
 
light of the properties described herebelow. In this field, there is known patent USP 4 432 
881, which relates to thickening agents constituted by a 
water-soluble polymer chain bearing hydrophobic side chains 
not having an LCST property (as defined below) in the useful 
temperature range. On these hydrophobic side chains is fixed the 
hydrophobic fraction of a surfactant. When the temperature rises, the surfactant is 
dehydrated, separates from the water, and a slight increase 
in viscosity occurs. In the present application, "useful temperature 
range", or an analogous expression, will designate the 
temperature range that corresponds to the application in 
view for the polymer
