<ABSTRACT>
A method and device are used for processing treetrunks (50) into wood products. The device comprises a circular saw (40) which has a spatially fixed deflecting element (44) parallel to a circular saw blade (41). The deflecting element (44) extends into the engagement region of teeth (42) of the circular saw blade (41). As side boards (side cuts) (51) are cut off, the deflecting element diverts these out of the plane of the teeth (42) from a main stock (52) of the treetrunk (50) directly after the passing of the teeth (42). The device further comprises first means for removing a wane (53) of the treetrunk (50), as well as second means for trimming the side boards (51) to predetermined lengths. The first means are constructed as edging-chipper assembly (60 to 63) and are arranged, in the conveying direction (54) of the treetrunk (50), directly downstream of the circular sawblade (40) but upstream of the second means.

A method for dissecting logs (50) into wood products, 
wherein side boards (51) are separated from a center log 

element (52) of the log (50) by means of a circular saw 
(40), wherein, further, the side boards (51), after having 

passed the teeth (42) of the cirular saw (40), are bent 
away, by means of a stationary deflection element (44), 

from a plane defined by the teeth (42), and are thereafter 
cut off to predetermined length, measures being taken for 

removing a wane (53) of the log (50), such that side boards 
(51) being edged on both sides may be produced, characterized 

in that the side boards (51), immediately after 
having been bent away, are fed to an edging and chipping 

unit (60 through 63) and are only therafter materially 
separated from the center log element (52). 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that a rotating 
edging and chipping tool (62) is used as the edging and 

chipping unit (60 through 63), the edging and chipping 
tool (62) having a diameter (D) being dimensioned such 

that the side boards (51) are passed by the edging and 
chipping tool (62) approximately under about 45° pressure 

angle. 
The method of claim 2, characterized in that the side 
boards, when engaged by the edging and chipping tool (62), 

are supported by a bracket (63). 
An apparatus for dissecting a log (50) into wood products, 
comprising a circular saw (40) being provided with a 

stationary deflection element (44) arranged parallel to  
 

a circular saw blade (41), the deflection element (44) 
extending into an area of action of teeth (42) of the 

circular saw blade (41) and, during the separation of side 
boards (51) from a center log element (52) of the log (50), 

bending the side boards (51) away from a plane defined 
by the teeth (42) immediately after the side boards (51) 

have passed the teeth (42), the apparatus, further, 
comprising first means for removing a wane (53) of the 

log (50) as well as second means for cutting off the side 
boards (51) to predetermined length, characterized in that 

the first means are configured as an edging and chipping 
unit (60 through 63) and, in a conveying direction (54) 

of the log (50), are arranged immediately downstream of 
the circular saw blade (40) but upstream of means for 

materially separating the side boards (51) from the center 
log element (52). 
The apparatus of claim 4, characterized in that the edging 
and chipping unit (60 through 63) comprises a rotating 

edging and chipping tool (62) having a diameter (D) being 
dimensioned such that the side boards (51) are adapted 

to be passed by the edging and chipping tool (62) approximately 
under about 45° pressure angle. 
The apparatus of claim 5, characterized in that a bracket 
(63) for the side boards (51) is provided in the area of 

action of the edging and cutting tool (62).
