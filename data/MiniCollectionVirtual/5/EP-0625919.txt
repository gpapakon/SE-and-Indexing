<ABSTRACT>
A vascular catheter has a highly flexible distal section (14). A biplanar control system (10, 28) is provided for enabling and controlling the movement of the distal catheter section (14) and tip (42) in any direction in a manner such that the distal tip (42) is capable of accessing any point on the wall of the chamber entered. Dual-wire biplanar control system embodiments include a vertical deflection control wire (62) operable to deflect the distal tip (42) of the catheter in a controlled manner in a vertical plane substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular catheter and a lateral deflection control wire (64) operable to deflect the distal tip (42) of the catheter in a controlled manner in a lateral plane substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tubular catheter. A one-wire system for both vertical and lateral control is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to an
improved catheter apparatus for use in the field of cardiac
arrhythmia ablation. In particular, the invention involves
the use of a biplanar deflection system which greatly
increases the maneuverability of the catheter tip in the
lateral plane generally perpendicular to that of the
disposition of the main catheter tube. This allows the
operator to direct the tip of the catheter in multiple
directions and maneuver the catheter as close as possible
to the site of the arrhythmogenic tissue of interest to
accomplish effective ablation.Normal cardiac pacing, in a healthy heart, is
controlled by a special structure known as the sinoatrial
node (SA node). This is the natural pacemaker of the heart
and is a specialized tissue located within the muscle walls
of the right atrium. The SA node provides impulses which
dominate the inherent or natural rhythmic contractions of
the heart atria and the ventricles. This dominance or
control involves the transmission of ionic impulses through
cardiac conduction pathways in the atria and the ventricles
which cause the heart to contract and relax in an orderly 
sequence at a rate dictated by the SA node. This sequence
ensures that blood flow to the systemic circulation or the
pulmonary system will be maximized with each ventricular
contraction. The SA node has its own inherent rate which
can be modified by signals from the nervous system. In
response to excitement, physical activity, etc., the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems react to
modify the rate.A depolarization impulse begins with the SA node and
spreads as an electrical wave from its location in the
right atrium across to the left atrium and down toward the
transition zone between the atrium and the ventricles where
another node, known as the atrioventricular (A-V) node or
junction, is located. This impulse conducts through the A-V
node in a slower fashion and continues to a common
pathway known as the Bundle of His between the right and
left ventricles, then into multiple paths called right and
left bundle branches, each bundle branch supplying one
ventricle. These bundle branches then divide into an
extensive network of finer paths of conducting tissue which
spread from the inner to the outer surfaces of the heart
and which are referred to as the Purkinje fibers. These
fibers feed the depolarization impulse into all portions of
the ventricular myocardium.As long as this system is intact, impulses are
transmitted normally and cardiac rhythm is
