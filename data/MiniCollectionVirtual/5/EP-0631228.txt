<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an accurate digital divider, and
relates to an electronic device which is capable of forming
the quotient of two numbers at high speed and without
rounding errors. The device may also be adapted to provide
an accurate remainder of the two numbers. The invention
also concerns a process of division capable of being
performed by such divider.It is well known to form the quotient of two numbers a/b by
using the number b to access a table of precomputed
quotients k/b where k is a number larger than the largest
expected b, and then multiplying to form a(k/b) which is k
times the required quotient. If k is chosen to be a power
of the base to which calculations are performed, the base
commonly being 2 for binary numbers, then dividing by k can
be achieved by discarding the least significant digits.This method is described, for example, in Proceedings of
the 10th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic, 26-28 June
1991, pages 186-190, R. Alversen: 'Integer Division Using
Reciprocals'. However the method suffers from limitations
of accuracy, the quotient often being in error by 1 or 2.It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a
division process and an accurate digital divider that
overcomes the above problem.A further object of the invention is to provide such a
process and device that is capable of providing the
remainder of such a division, with greater accuracy.This object is achieved by the features of Claims 1, 3, 5
and 6. In order to aid understanding of the invention, an analysis
of the process of division will be set out below.We must first define three operators
/which is real number division, and gives a
fractional result,divwhich applies only to integers, and produces a
result which is the real number division of its
operands rounded towards minus infinity, andremwhich is the remainder when two numbers are
divided.We are not concerned at this point with division by
negative numbers. However, if two numbers are to be
divided and one is negative, and we reverse the signs of
both, the then the same 
quotient will be obtained.Hence we may observe the relationships that
( a div b ) * b + a rem b = a
and therefore
a / b = a div b + ( a rem b ) / bIf we perform division by the known process described above,
then, in attempting to evaluate a div b we really evaluate
( a * ( k div b ) ) div k
= ( a * ( k - k rem b ) / b ) div k
= ( k * ( a / b ) - a * ( k rem b ) / b ) div k
= ( k * ( a div b ) + k * ( a rem b ) / b - a * ( k rem b ) / b) div k
when we wanted
( k * ( a div b
