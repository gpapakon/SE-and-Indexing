by laminating at least a first magnetic layer and a 

second magnetic layer in an order named on a substrate

 is a 
magnetic wall energy between the first and second 

magnetic layers, M

 is a saturation magnetization of 
the second magnetic layer, and h₂ is a film thickness of 

the second magnetic layer. The coercive force of the 
first magnetic layer is grater than σ

s1
 
is a saturation magnetization of the first magnetic 

layer, and h₁ is a film thickness of the first magnetic 
layer. The compensation temperature of the first 

magnetic layer is smaller than the Curie temperature of 
the first magnetic layer. A method of recording 

information on the magnetooptical recording medium is 
effected as follows. A direction of a magnetic moment 

of the first magnetic layer is aligned in one direction 

by applying an external magnetic field thereto. A 
laser spot with low power is irradiated to the medium 

while applying a recording bias magnetic field in the 
same direction as the direction of the external 

magnetic field so as to form a first recording bit in a  
 

high temperature region in the laser spot. A laser 
spot with high power is irradiated to the medium while 

applying the recording bias magnetic field so as to 
form a second recording bit in which a magnetic wall is 

present between the first and second magnetic layers, 
in the high-temperature region in the laser spot. One 

of the first bit forming recording and the second bit 
forming recording is selectively determined in 

correspondence with information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptical 
recording medium on which information is recorded, 
reproduced, and erased using a laser beam, and a 
magnetooptical recording/reproduction method. A conventional magnetooptical recording method is 
time-consuming since it requires three processes, i.e., 
erasing, recording, and collation processes upon 
recording of information. In order to solve this 
problem, the following overwrite methods have been 
proposed. In this method, the intensity of an irradiation 
laser beam is maintained constant, and the polarity of 
a magnetic field to be applied is inverted at high 
speed in correspondence with recording information, 
thereby achieving recording (Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application Nos. 63-204532 and 63-76135, and the like). 
In this method, the polarity of the magnetic field to 
be applied must be inverted at high speed. For this 
reason, high electric power must be input in order to  
 
generate a recording magnetic field from a position 
separated from the medium surface by a given distance 
so as to prevent collision between a recording head for 
generating the magnetic field and the medium surface, 
and it is technically difficult to realize this method. 
Also, a method of bringing a magnetic head very close 
to the medium surface is proposed. However, with this 
method, an original merit of an optical disk, i.e., 
non-contact recording/reproduction, is not utilized. In this method, a magnetooptical recording medium 
which comprises, as a recording layer, a two-layered 
film consisting of a rare earth-transition metal 
amorphous alloy, is used, and an overwrite operation is 
performed by utilizing the exchange-coupling force 
between the two layers (Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application No. 62-175948, and the like). More 
specifically, a magnetooptical medium, which comprises 
a recording layer consisting of, e.g., TbFe, and an 
auxiliary layer consisting of TbFeCo, is used. After 
initialization for aligning the direction of 
magnetization of the auxiliary layer is performed, a 
recording bias magnetic field is applied, and a laser 
beam of binary power is irradiated, thus realizing an 
overwrite operation. With this method, there is a case 
of existing a magnetic wall between the two layers when 
information is recorded, and a problem associated with  
 
stability of recorded information, a problem associated 
with a large magnetic field required in initialization, 
and the like still remain unsolved. The present invention aims to at least
