<ABSTRACT>
The seat pan (46) of an aircraft passenger sleeper 
seat is mounted on a pivot axle (48) for movement between 

a normal substantially horizontal position and a tilted 
position in which its front edge is lower than its rear 

edge. The seat back comprises a first portion (40) which 
is mounted for angular movement between a substantially 

upright position and a reclined position, and a second 
portion (42) mounted on a pivot axle (48) for movement 

between an erect position in which it is substantially 
parallel to the first portion (40) and a reclined position 

in which its upper edge is lower than when in its erect 
position. When the seat pan (46) is tilted and the second 

portion (42) of the seat back is reclined, their upper 
surfaces form a substantially plane support surface for a 

sleeping passenger.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle seat of the 
type comprising a base frame, a seat back mounted on the 
base frame for angular movement between a substantially 
upright position and a reclined position, a seat pan having 
an upper surface, and mounting means supporting the seat 
pan on the base frame so as to permit change of the 
orientation of an upper surface of the seat pan between a 
substantially horizontal position and a tilted position in 
which its front edge is lower than its rear edge. A seat of 
this type is disclosed in US-A-5 058 954. The invention is 
particularly, but not exclusively applicable to a seat of 
the type which also has a legrest which can be raised. 
Such seats are commonly known as sleeper seats and are used 
extensively as aircraft passenger seats. US-A-3 865 432 discloses a reclining chair having 
a backrest reclinably mounted on a seat pan and a headrest 
mounted on the back rest for angular movement relative 
thereto. The chair also has a legrest. Many airlines use a pitch between successive rows 
of sleeper seats of about 62 inches (1575 mm). 
Consequently, it is not feasible to lower the seat back and 
raise the legrest of a sleeper seat sufficiently to form a 
continuous horizontal surface with the seat pan. With 
known sleeper seats, the maximum extent to which the seat 
back can be tilted is substantially above the horizontal. 
Similarly, the maximum extent to which the legrest can be 
raised is substantially below the horizontal. In this 
position, the seat back, seat pan and legrest form a zigzag 
surface which is fairly comfortable for people who sleep on 
their backs but is less comfortable for people who prefer 
to sleep on their sides. It is an object of the invention 
to provide a sleeper seat in which this disadvantage is 
reduced. According to the invention, the seat back of a 
vehicle seat of the type described above comprises a first 
portion which is mounted for angular movement between said 
substantially upright position and said reclined position,  
 
and a second portion having an outer surface supported on 
mounting means which permit change of its orientation 
between an erect position in which it is substantially 
parallel to the first portion and a reclined position in 
which its lower edge is substantially coplanar with the 
rear edge of the seat pan when said seat pan is in its 
tilted position. Embodiments of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle seat comprising a base frame (10), a 
seat back (24, 40, 68, 80, 88, 102, 132) mounted on the 

base frame (10) for angular movement between a 
substantially upright position and a reclined position, a 

seat pan (22, 46, 60, 82, 86, 100, 130) having an upper 
surface, and mounting means supporting the seat pan (22, 

46, 60, 100, 130) on the base frame so as to permit change 
of the orientation of an upper surface of the seat pan (22, 

46, 60, 100, 130) between a substantially horizontal 
position and a tilted position in which its front edge is 

lower than its rear edge, characterised in that the seat 
back comprises a first portion (24, 40, 66, 76, 102, 132) 

which is mounted for angular movement between said 
substantially upright position and said reclined position, 

and a second portion (26, 42, 68, 128, 176) having an outer 
surface supported on mounting means which permit change of 

its orientation between an erect position in which it is 
substantially parallel to the first portion and a reclined 

position in which its lower edge is substantially coplanar 
with the rear edge of the seat pan (22, 46, 60, 100, 130) 

when said seat pan is in its tilted position. 
A vehicle seat according to claim 1, wherein the 
second portion (26, 42, 68) of the seat back (24, 40, 68) 

is pivotally mounted for angular movement about a 
transverse axis (44, 70, 78) between said erect position 

and said reclined position. 
A vehicle seat according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
