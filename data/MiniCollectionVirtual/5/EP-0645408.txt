<ABSTRACT>
An amino-containing curing component for epoxy resins for the preparation of curable mixtures and paint (surface coating, lacquer, enamel, varnish) preparations which can even be used at low temperature, obtained by reacting alkylated polyhydroxyaromatic compounds (A) with polyamines (B) and aldehydes (C) by the Mannich reaction mechanism.

<CLAIMS>
A curing component containing amino groups for
epoxy resins, which is obtainable by reaction of

alkylated polyhydroxy aromatics (A) with
polyamines (B) and aldehydes (C) by the mechanism

of the Mannich reaction, wherein

the alkylated polyhydroxy aromatics (A) have at
least two hydroxyl groups each connected to an

aromatic ring and are preparable by acid
catalysis from a corresponding polyhydroxy

aromatic (al) and an unsaturated compound (a2)
which carries at least one olefinic double

bond;
the polyamines (B) are selected from amines
having at least two primary aliphatic amino

groups, polyamidoamines, polyalkylene oxide
polyamines and epoxy resin-amine adducts; and
the reaction takes place such that the melt of
the alkylated polyhydroxy aromatic (A) is taken

up at from 100 to 140°C by the polyamine (B),
and subsequently, at from 70 to 120°C, the

aldehyde (C) is added.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the molar ratio of components (al) and (a2) is

1.0 : 0.1 to 1.0 : 3.0.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein

the polyamine (B) contains at least two primary 
amino groups, each of the primary amino groups

being connected to an aliphatic carbon atom.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the aldehyde (C) is formaldehyde.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the polyhydroxy aromatic (a1) is resorcinol or a

novolak based on resorcinol and formaldehyde.
A curing component as claimed in claim 5, wherein
the molar ratio of resorcinol to formaldehyde in

the novolak is 2.0 : 5.0 to 2.0 : 1.0.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the unsaturated compound (a2) is 2-phenylpropene

and/or styrene.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the molar ratio of components (A), based on moles

of polyhydroxy aromatic (a1) employed, to (B) is
0.1 : 2.0 to 2.0 : 1.0.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the molar ratio of components (B) to (C) is 1.0 :

0.1 to 1.0 : 2.0.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the polyamine (B) is 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)benzene

or a mixture of 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)benzene with
another polyamine.
A curing component as claimed in claim 1, which
additionally comprises primary aliphatic

monoamines.
The use of a curing component as claimed in claim
1 for the preparation of curable mixtures. 
The use of a curing component as claimed in claim
1 in paint formulations.
A curable mixture comprising a curing component as
claimed in claim 1, an epoxy resin, if appropriate

a diluent and if appropriate customary additives.
