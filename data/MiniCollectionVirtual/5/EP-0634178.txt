<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for the treatment of liquid hospital 
waste, comprising a first (1) and a second (2) watertight 

treatment chamber, connected together by means of a 
syphon (9) and an overflow pipe (10), and provided with 

stirrers (14 and 15) for the waste. The first chamber is 
provided with an inlet (7-8) for receiving the waste, 

means for cutting off the entrance of the waste and 
causing it to be transferred to the second chamber (2), 

and means (21) for supplying a dispersing agent. The 
second chamber is provided with an outlet (11), means 

(20) for expelling the waste, and means for supplying a 
disinfecting agent. The different phases or stages are 

controlled by detectors comprising pressurestats.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
the treatment of liquid hospital waste with which it is 
possible to carry out the continuous treatment of said 
waste, as a result of which it reaches a state in which 
it is fit to be poured into the general sewage system. The patent US 5.087.420 describes an apparatus for 
the treatment of infectious waste comprising a waste 
pulper, a tank for mixing the waste with a disinfectant 
and a recirculation and discharge pump. The different 
stages are controlled by means of a level sensor and a 
clock. This kind of apparatus is suitable for the treatment 
of solid waste, is high in cost and furthermore does 
not provide sufficient treatment of the waste such that 
it can be poured directly into the public sewage system. The British patent 2.251.403 describes an apparatus 
for the treatment of waste and which makes it possible to  
 
simultaneously collect waste from one or several different 
points. This apparatus is provided with two containing 
chambers, each of which has a suction or vacuuming 
connector. Both containers are positioned at approximately 
the same height and their upper and lower parts are 
connected together by pipes of different cross sections. 
Furthermore, it includes another group of pipes and 
auxiliary control elements. This type of apparatus has an 
excessively complicated in terms of both its constitution 
and its operation. The object of the present invention is an apparatus 
for the treatment of liquid hospital waste which has a 
simple constitution and operation and a relatively low 
cost. Another object of the invention is an apparatus by 
means of which the waste reaches a state in which it is 
fit to be poured into the town sewage system. To achieve 
this, the apparatus of the invention is constituted in 
such a way that it automatically carries out waste treatment 
in two consecutive stages as a result of which the 
waste that is treated fulfils the required hygienic and 
ecological conditions. According to the present invention, the apparatus 
for the treatment of liquid hospital waste consists of a 
first and a second watertight treatment chamber, connected 
together by means of a syphon and an overflow 
pipe, both of said chambers being provided with stirrers 
for the liquid waste. The first of said chambers is provided with an inlet 
for receiving the liquid waste, means for cutting off the 
entrance of the waste and causing it to be transferred to 
the second chamber, and means for supplying a dispersing  
 
agent to

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the treatment of liquid hospital 
waste, characterized in that it comprises a first and a 

second watertight treatment chamber, connected together 
by means of a syphon and an overflow pipe, and provided 

with stirrers for the liquid waste; said first chamber 
being provided with an inlet for receiving the liquid 

waste, means for cutting off the entrance of the waste 
and causing it to be transferred to the second chamber, 

and means for supplying a dispersing agent to said first 
chamber; and said second chamber being provided with a 

waste outlet, means for expelling said waste, and means 
for supplying a disinfecting agent to said second chamber. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the two chambers are superposed such that the 

first chamber is positioned above the second chamber, the 
stirrers of both chambers being driven via coaxial axes 

from a common motor positioned above the first chamber. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means for cutting off the entrance of the 

waste into the first chamber and causing it to be transferred 
from said first chamber to the second chamber 

comprise a detector for detecting a predetermined maximum 
volume of waste in the first chamber, an electrically 

operated valve for supplying water to said first chamber 
and a device for controlling the entrance of the water; 

said electrically operated valve being activated by said 
level detector such that it opens, and remaining open 

until the device that controls the entrance of the water 
detects the priming of the syphon which connects the two 

chambers and the start of the transfer of the waste to 
the second chamber. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
 

in that the means of supplying a dispersing agent to the 
first chamber consist of a detector for detecting a 

predetermined minimum volume of waste in said first 
chamber and a pump for supplying the dispersant, said 

pump being activated by said detector to cause the injection 
of a predetermined amount of dispersant. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means of supplying a disinfecting agent to 

the second chamber comprise a detector for detecting a 
predetermined amount of waste in the second chamber and a 

pump which is activated by the detector to cause the 
injection of a predetermined volume of dispersant. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means of expelling the waste from the second 

chamber comprise a detector for detecting a predetermined 
volume of waste and a pump which is activated by said 

detector. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means of expelling the waste from the second 

chamber comprise a syphon, which starts when the volume 
of waste inside the chamber reaches a predetermined 

value, and a detector for detecting the waste and ensuring 
that said chamber is completely evacuated. 
An apparatus according to claims 3 and 4, characterized 
in that each of said detectors consists of a 

pressurestat. 
An apparatus according to claim 8, characterized 
in that at least one of the pressurestats which ensures 

the entrance of water, dispersant and disinfectant into 
the chambers measures the variations in pressure produced 

in an auxiliary air chamber through which runs a pipe 
inside which flows the liquid which is introduced into 

the chamber.
