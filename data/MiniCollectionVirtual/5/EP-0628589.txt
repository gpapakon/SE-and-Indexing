<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of amino-substituted organo 
polysiloxanes which comprises the steps of mixing a catalyst 

comprising both (i) at least one compound selected from barium 
hydroxide and strontium hydroxide and (ii) at least one compound 

selected from borates and phosphates of sodium with (A) a 
silanol terminated organopolysiloxane compound and (B) an 

organosilicon compound having at least one silicon-bonded alkoxy 
or alkoxyalkoxy group and a monovalent substituent composed of 

carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen and having at least one -NH₂ 
therein attached to silicon by way of a silicon to carbon 

linkage and thereafter allowing (A) and (B) to react at a 
temperature of at least 50°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the 
preparation of organopolysiloxanes having silicon-bonded 
substituents containing amino groups. Organosiloxane polymers having silicon-bonded 
aminoalkyl or polyaminoalkyl groups are known. They are 
employed interalia as components of polish compositions 
and in the treatment of textile fibres to impart thereto 
properties such as softness and shrink resistance. Polymers which may be used for such applications can 
be prepared from the appropriate cyclic siloxanes by an 
equilibration reaction. However, such a route results in 
the formation of a relatively high proportion of volatile 
compounds in the product rendering it less than 
satisfactory for some applications. Amino-containing 
siloxane polymers may also be obtained by reacting together 
an organosiloxane having silicon-bonded hydroxyl groups and 
a silane having silicon-bonded alkoxy groups and aminoalkyl 
or polyaminoalkyl groups, see for example British Patent 
GB-A-942 587. It was found, however, that when prepared by such 
a method the viscosity of the polymer increased during 
storage. A method of reducing the rate of increase in 
viscosity of such organosiloxanes is disclosed in 
GB 2 036 052 B wherein the hydroxylated siloxane and the 
amino-containing silane are reacted together in a specified 
range of proportions. Although a significant reduction in 
viscosity drift can be achieved according to the teaching 
of GB 2 036 052 B there has existed a need for further 
improvement in this respect. E.P. 0 382 365 A2 discloses a process for the 
preparation of an organosilicon condensation product 
wherein there are reacted together in the presence of a  
 
catalytic substance selected from barium hydroxide and 
strontium hydroxide, an organosilicon compound having at 
least one silicon-bonded hydroxyl group and an organo-silicon 
compound having at least one silicon-bonded -OX 
group in which X represents certain alkyl or alkoxyalkyl 
groups. Said EP also discloses that residual silanol 
groups in the condensation product can be condensed by 
subsequent contact with a second catalyst which may be a 
borate or phosphate of sodium or potassium. Although the 
said process can be employed for the preparation of amino-containing 
organopolysiloxanes it has been found that where 
the organosilicon compounds having at least one silicon-bonded 
OX group are silanes, the process yields by-products 
which are dimers of the silanes. Quite apart from the fact 
that the dimer material is an impurity and
