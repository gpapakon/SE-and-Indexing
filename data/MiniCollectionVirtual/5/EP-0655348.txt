<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dye donor elements 
used in thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to 
the use of a certain subbing layer for the dye layer, 
the subbing layer having antistatic properties. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and 
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,621,271. For media transport and handling, an 
antistatic layer is usually needed in a dye-donor 
element, since there is dust accumulation on a 
statically charged surface and potential sparking which 
may destroy heating elements in the thermal head. The  
 
antistatic material is usually located in or over a 
slipping layer coated on the back side of the dye-donor 
element. U.S. Patent No. 4,737,486 discloses the use 
of a titanium alkoxide as a subbing layer between a 
support and a dye layer. While this material is a good 
subbing layer for adhesion, problems have arisen with 
hydrolytic instability, and the layer is difficult to 
coat in a reproducible manner. It has also been 
observed that degradation of dyes in the dye-donor 
element can occur when titanium alkoxides are used in a 
subbing layer. U.S. Patent 5,147,843 discloses the use of 
mixtures of poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(vinyl 
pyrrolidinone) as a subbing layer. Although the 
mixture disclosed in this patent is a good subbing 
layer, it does not provide any antistatic properties to 
the dye-donor element. Research Disclosure article
