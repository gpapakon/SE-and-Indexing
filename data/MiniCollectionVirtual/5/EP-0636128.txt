 DESCRIPTIONPIPERAZINOCARBONYLCARBOSTYRILS AS PERIPHERAL VASODILATORS[Industrial Field of Utilization]The present invention relates to peripheral vasodilators each comprising a carbostyril derivative as an active ingredient, as well as to novel carbostyril derivatives having an excellent peripheral vasodilating activity.[Prior Art and Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]There have been made a number of studies on various carbostyril derivatives and their pharmaco- logical activities. For example, Japanese PatentApplication Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 3182/1989 describe that the carbostyril derivatives represented by the following general formula:[wherein, R is a group of the formula:or a group of the formula: 
(Rl1 is a group of the formula: -NR4'R5' or the like; R2" is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; and R3' is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or the like)] have a myocardial contraction increasing activity, a coronary blood flow increasing activity, a hypotensive activity, a norepinephrin vasocontraction inhibitory effect and an anti-inflammatory effect and are useful as a cardiotonic for treating various heart diseases, an anti-hyperten¬ sive agent and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is not known, however, that such carbostyril derivatives have a peripheral vasodilating activity.In addition to the above, various carbostyril derivatives, each of which having chemical structural formula similar to that of the carbostyril derivative represented by the below-mentioned general formula (1), have been known in some prior art references, for example Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) No. Sho 57- 171974 (1982) [Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 64- 9313 (1989)]; Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) No. Sho 57-154129 (1982) [Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 64-53248 (1989)]; Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) No. Sho 59-29668 (1984) [Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 2-22751 (1990)]; Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) Nos.
