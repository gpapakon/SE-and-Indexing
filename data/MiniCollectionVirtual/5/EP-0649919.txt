<ABSTRACT>
Plant for cathodic deposition treatment of surfaces of metal articles (5), especially of motor vehicle bodies, supplied with direct current, which includes a tank (1) whose edges carry anodes (2), an overhead conveyor which brings the articles (5) to be treated spaced at a uniform distance  lambda , and which carries moving bodies for delivering (4) current in contact with at least one current-conductor rail (11) mounted on at least one support and localised above the tank (1), and in which the articles (5) to be treated form cathodes, characterised in that the rail (11) is divided uniformly at intervals substantially equal to  lambda /2 into portions (111) separated by an insulating material and connected to the negative terminals (31) of rectifiers (3) of the current supply to the plant.

Installation for surface treatment by cataphoresis of metal pieces 
(5), particularly of bodies of automotive vehicles, supplied with 

direct current, which comprises a bath (1), the sides of which carry 
anodes (2), an aerial conveyor which conveys the pieces (5) to be 

treated spaced at a regular distance λ and which carries mobile 
current supply means (4) in contact with at least one current 

conducting rail (11) mounted on at least one support and situated 
above the bath (1), and in which the pieces (5) to be treated 

constitute the cathodes, characterised by the fact that the rail (11) 
is divided regularly at intervals substantially equal to λ/2 into 

sections (111) separated by an insulating material and connected 
to the negative terminals (31) of rectifiers (3) of the current supply 

of the installation. 
Installation according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that some 
sections (111) of rail (11) are supplied directly by a rectifier (3) and 

that other sections (111') are supplied by means of two thyristors 
(22, 23) in opposition, each of them being connected to a different 

rectifier (3) so that two juxtaposed sections (111, 111') have a 
different method of supply. 
Installation according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that the 
thyristors (22, 23) of each section (111', 121') are located 

respectively at its extremities, and that the thyristors (22) of sections 
(111', 121') adjacent to a common section (111, 121) directly 

supplied by a rectifier (3) located in the proximity of said section 
(111, 121) are connected to the rectifier (3) which directly supplies 

this section (111, 121).  
 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised by 
the fact that the mobile means are constituted in a manner known 

per se by carriages (4) fitted with at least one contact shoe (41) 
mounted on the rail (11) and carried by swing trays which support 

the pieces (5) to be treated and that the dividing areas (151) have 
a length which is less than that of a shoe (41). 
Installation according to claim 4, characterised by the fact that the 
carriages (4) comprise two contact shoes (41, 42) mounted on two 

parallel conducting rails (11, 12) situated above the bath (1) and 
that the dividing areas (151, 152) face one another. 
Installation according to claim 5, characterised by the fact that each 
cable for direct supply via a rectifier (3) or indirect supply across a 

thyristor (22, 23) forms abridge (14) between the two rails (11, 12). 
Installation for surface treatment by cataphoresis of metal pieces 
(5), particularly of bodies of automotive vehicles, supplied with 

direct current, which comprises a bath (1), the sides of which carry 
anodes (2), an aerial conveyor which conveys the pieces (5) to be 

treated in swing trays spaced at a regular distance λ, each of them 
comprising a carriage (4) fitted with two contact shoes (41, 42) 

mounted on two parallel conducting rails (11, 12) situated above the 
bath (1), and in which the pieces (5) to be treated constitute the 

cathodes, characterised by the fact that the two rails (11, 12) are 
divided in a manner known per se regularly into sections (111, 121) 

separated by an insulating material and connected to the negative 
terminals (31) of rectifiers (3) of the current supply of the installation 

and that the dividing areas (151, 152) are offset with respect to one 
another between the two rails (11, 12).  

 
Installation according to claim 7, characterised by the fact that the 
dividing areas (151, 152) of a same rail (11, 12) are spaced at 

intervals of λ and that the linear offset between the dividing areas 
(151, 152) situated on the two rails (11, 12) is equal to λ/2. 
Installation according to any one of claims 7 or 8, characterised by 
the fact that the dividing zones (151, 152) have a length greater 

than that of a shoe (41, 42) and less than λ/4. 
Installation according to any one of claims 7 to 9, characterised by 
the fact that each section (111, 121) of rail (11, 12) is connected to 

an assembly (20) of thyristors (21) each of which is connected to 
the negative terminal (31) of a rectifier (3). 
Installation according to claim 10, characterised by the fact that the 
thyristors (21) of a same assembly (20) are grouped together and 

located in the proximity of the rails (11, 12). 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised by 
the fact that the negative terminals (31) of the rectifiers (3) are 

respectively connected to diodes (16), the anodes (161) of which 
are connected to the mass of the bath (1). 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised by 
the fact that the number of rectifiers (3) is equal to the number of 

pieces (5) present in the bath (1) at the same time.
