<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a signal distribution arrangement, comprising a central signal source (SQ), a plurality of signal receivers (SEi) and in each case one cable from the signal source (SQ) to the individual signal receivers (SEi),   - the cables being passed along a common route (x) along which branches (Ai) for the individual signal receivers (SEi) are present, the cable of the i-th signal receiver being laid an odd number of times along the common route from the signal source (SQ) to the branch (Ai) for the i-th signal receiver (SEi) and being laid an even number of times from this branch (Ai) to the end of the common route, and - the cables being split into at least two sections which have different relative sensitivities, and - the following relationship applying for the cables in the route elements ( DELTA x) along the common route (x): Number of runs of the cable 
<
*
>
 relative sensitivity of the cable = constant.

<CLAIMS>
Signal distribution arrangement, comprising a central signal 
source (SQ), several signal receivers (SE
1
) and also respective 
lines from the signal source (SQ) to the individual signal 

receivers (SE
1
), 
characterised in that
the lines are guided along a common path (x), along which 
there are feeders (A
1
) for the individual signal receivers 
(SE
1
), the line for the i-th signal receiver being laid an 
odd number of times along the common path from the signal 

source (SQ) to the feeder (A
i
) for the i-th signal receiver 
(SE
1
) and being laid an even number of times from that 
feeder (A
1
) to the end of the common path, and 
the lines are divided into at least two sections which have 

different relative sensitivities and 
the following applies to the lines in the path increments 
(Δx) along the common path (x);
 
the number of runs of the line * relative sensitivity of the 

line = constant. 
Signal distribution arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the relative sensitivity is adjusted by way 

of the quotient ds/dx ≥ 1, with x = coordinate along the common 
path, s = coordinate along the line. 
Signal distribution arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the quotient ds/dx is adjusted by guiding 

the line in the form of a helix of defined pitch. 
Signal distribution arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the relative sensitivity is adjusted by 

suitable choice of material or by doping.  
 
Signal distribution arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the lines are twisted with 

one another. 
Signal distribution arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the lines are embedded in 

a common matrix which passes the external influences uniformly 
over the cross-section of all lines, thus suppressing interference 

gradients. 
Signal distribution arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the line bundle is 

isolated against external interference gradients. 
Signal distribution arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that it is used not to 

distribute signals but to gather signals, the central signal 
source being replaced by a central receiver and the signal 

receivers being replaced by devices for feeding in signals.
