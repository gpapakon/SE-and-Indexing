<ABSTRACT>
A switch (SM) is provided which successively switches 
contacts (1-9) at a timing sufficiently quick with respect 

to reproduced signals in reproducing a magnetic tape on 
which digital recording is effected, and which switches 

contacts (R·L) at similar timing in reproducing a magnetic 
tape on which analog recording is effected. On signals 

provided through this switch (SM) and through an 
analog·digital converting circuit (AD), processing such as 

waveform equalization corresponding to the type of 
magnetic tape is effected by a digital equalizer (DEQ). 

By this digital equalizer (DEQ), correction of frequency 
characteristic in accordance with the type of the magnetic 

tape and correction of frequency characteristic inherent 
to the head per se are effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic 
reproducing apparatus, for example a magnetic tape 
reproducing apparatus, which is adapted to reproduce 
information recorded on a magnetic medium in at least two 
different recording formats. Recently, digital recording technique has been 
developed in the field of magnetic tape apparatuses. 
Equipments capable of recording·reproducing information in 
the form of digital signals such as a digital audio tape 
recorder has been developed. However, these equipments 
are not compatible with conventional equipments for 
recording·reproducing analog signals, and therefore such 
digital equipments have not yet been widely accepted. This being the case, equipments which are compatible 
with the conventional analog recording·reproducing 
equipments have been proposed. For example, a cassette 
recorder·reproducer for recording and reproducing analog 
signals using a cassette tape containing a magnetic tape 
therein has been known. There has been proposed a  
 
cassette recorder·reproducer, which is an improvement of 
the conventional one, which allows recording·reproducing 
of digital signals by a cassette tape of a similar type as 
the cassette tape mentioned above. For audio recording digital signals on the 
aforementioned cassette recorder·reproducer, eighteen 
tracks TR1-1 to TR1-18 are formed on a magnetic tape T1, 
for example, as shown in Fig. 12. In such a recording 
format, tracks TR1-1 to TR1-9 and tracks TR1-10 to TR1-18 
correspond to two divided recording areas α1 and β1 of the 
tape, and synthesized stereo sound are recorded on the 
tracks TR1-1 to TR1-9 and tracks TR1-10 to TR1-18. For reproduction, magnetic tape T1 is moved in the 
direction of the arrow P so as to read audio signals on 
tracks TR1-1 to TR1-9, while the tape T1 is moved in the 
direction of the arrow Q so as to read audio signals on 
tracks TR1-10 to TR1-18. When audio recording is to be carried out in the 
conventional analog manner by using the cassette 
recorder·reproducer, four tracks TR2-1 to TR2-4 are formed 
on a magnetic tape T2, for example, as shown in Fig. 13. 
In such a recording format, tracks TR2-1 and TR2-2 and 
tracks TR2-3 and TR2-4 correspond to two divided recording 
areas α2 and β2. Audio signals of left and right channels 
are recorded on tracks TR2-1 and TR2-2, respectively,  
 
while audio signals of right and left channels are 
recorded on tracks TR2-3 and TR2-4, respectively. In order to read audio signals on tracks TR2-1 and 
TR2-2, magnetic tape T2 is moved
