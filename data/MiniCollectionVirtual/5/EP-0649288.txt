<DESCRIPTION>
 EXTENDABLE GUIDEWIRE ASSEMBLYDescriptionTechnical FieldThis invention is in the general field of surgical instruments and relates specifically to guidewires that are used in cardiovascular and endovascular procedures to facilitate the placement of catheters within the vasculature of patients.BackgroundThe general procedure for placing catheters within vessels is to track a guidewire through the vesr?.l to the desired position and advance the catheter over tne guidewire. Guidewires are required because the catheters themselves do not have sufficient column strength or torqueability to be able to be tracked or steered through the vessel. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,884,579. In some procedures such as angioplasty using dilatation balloon catheters, it is necessary to exchange catheters to increase balloon size. It may also be necessary in some instances to replace catheters due to material fatigue. Two guidewire techniques have been employed in such instances. In one, the initial guidewire is removed and replaced with an exchange wire that is somewhat greater than double the length of the catheter. In order to avoid the need for a separate exchange wire a second technique that involves attaching an extension wire to the initial guidewire was developed. 

 U.S. Pats. NOS. 4,917,103 and 4,922,923 describe an extendable guidewire assembly that employs a sleeve that is connected to the proximal end of the guidewire and into which the distal end of the extension wire is inserted. The sleeve and extension are then crimped to form a permanent joint or union between the two wires.U.S. 4,875,489 describes another type of extendable guidewire assembly in which one of the wires has a tapered tip and the other has an expandable sleeve into which the tip is received. A second concentric sleeve encloses the expandable sleeve to ensure a friction fit between the tapered tip and expandable sleeve. U.S. 4,966,163 describes yet another kind of extendable quidewire assembly. In this assembly one of the wires carries an internally threaded sleeve and the other wire carries a threaded head. The two wires are coupled together by threading the head into the sleeve. Applicant is also aware of an extendable quidewire assembly design in which one of the wires carries an open-ended sleeve and the other wire has a tapered tip encircled by a helical coil. The wires are coupled by inserting the tip into the sleeve and twisting it. The twisting causes the coil to expand and form a friction fit with the interior"of the sleeve.

 Claims
1. An extendable guidewire assembly for use within a patient's vasculature comprising in combination: (a) a guidewire having a distal end that is adapted to be fed into said vasculature and a proximal end that has a first longitudinal interlocking member;
(b) an extension wire having a proximal end and a distal end that has a second longitudinal interlocking member that is adapted to longitudinally overlap and interlock with the first interlocking member; and
(c) a retractable sleeve carried concentrically about one of either the proximal end of the guidewire or the distal end of the extension wire, the sleeve being longitudinally movable from a retracted position in which it does not enclose an interlocking member to an extended position in which it encloses the overlapped, interlocked members to prevent said members from substantial radial movement relative to each other.
2. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 1 wherein the retractable sleeve is carried about the distal end of the extension wire.
3. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 1 wherein the assembly includes biasing means for biasing the sleeve to said extended position.
4. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 3 wherein the biasing means is a coil spring.
5. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 1 wherein the first interlocking member comprises a longitudinal tip of less diameter than the diameter of 


 the proximal end of the guidewire, one end of which is integral with the guidewire and the other end of which carries a first radial protuberance, and the second interlocking member comprises a longitudinal tip of less diameter than the diameter of the distal end of the guidewire extension, one end of which is integral with the extension wire and the other end of which has a second radial protuberance, the inner diameter of the sleeve being less than the combined diameters of the first and second radial protuberances.
6. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 5 wherein the first radial protuberance comprises a first coil wrapped about said other end of the longitudinal tip of the guidewire and said second radial protuberance comprises a second coil wrapped about said other end of the longitudinal tip of the extension wire.
7. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 1 wherein the first interlocking member comprises a ball and the second interlocking member comprises a pair of radially extendable resilient jaws that define a socket adapted to receive said ball.
8. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim 1 wherein the first interlocking member comprises a first tang and the second interlocking member comprises a second tang adapted to interlock with the first tang.
9. The extendable guidewire assembly of claim
1 wherein the first interlocking member comprises a cylindrical head and the second interlocking member comprises a cylindrical bore in the distal end of the guidewire that is adapted to receive the cylindrical head.
