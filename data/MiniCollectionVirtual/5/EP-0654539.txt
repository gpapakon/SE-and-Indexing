<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing titanium dioxide by the sulphate process, in which titanium-containing raw materials are digested in the presence of metallic iron and sulphuric acid, subsequently hydrolysed and the titanium oxide hydrate (hydrated titanium oxide) formed is calcined.

Process for the preparation of titanium dioxide by the 
sulphate process by digestion of titanium-containing 

raw materials with sulphuric acid with the formation 
of so-called black solution, reduction of Fe
3+
 in the 
black solution, hydrolysis of the black solution with 

the formation of titanium oxide hydrate and so-called 
dilute acid, calcination of the titanium oxide hydrate 

to titanium dioxide, characterised in that, before or 
during the digestion, metallic iron is added and that 

the reduction in the black solution is conducted with 

a Ti
3+
-containing solution which is prepared by the 
digestion of titanium-containing residues from 

titanium dioxide production or by the digestion of 
titanium-containing raw materials or by the digestion 

of mixtures thereof with sulphuric acid with the 
addition of metallic iron. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
steel scrap and/or foundry scrap and/or other material 

containing metallic iron with a content of 
>
1 wt.% 
metallic iron, based on total weight, is used. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the concentration of the sulphuric acid present in the 

digestion is 65 to 100 wt.%, particularly 80 to 
96 wt.% H
2
SO
4
 and the maximum digestion temperature is 
150째C to 300째C, particularly 170째C to 220째C. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
titanium ores, slags, undigested residue from a 

digestion of titanium-containing raw materials by the 
sulphate process and mixtures thereof are used as the 

titanium-containing raw material.
