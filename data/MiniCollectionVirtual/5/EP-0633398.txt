Fuel injection pump, especially fuel distributor 
injection pump, for internal combustion engines, having 

at least one pump piston (6) which is guided in a pump 
cylinder (7) and which, on one side, delimits a pump 

working space (9) and, on its other side, is connected 
operatively to a cam drive arranged in a driving-gear 

space (2) supplied with lubricating fluid, for the 
execution of pumping and suction strokes, having a 

movable wall (27) which encloses, within the fuel 
injection pump, a fuel-filled suction space (12) supplied 

from a fuel source and which separates said suction space 
from the driving-gear space (2), out of which suction 

space (12) fuel is delivered to the pump working space 
(9) during the suction stroke of the pump piston (6) and 

into which space, under the control of a solenoid valve 
(13) which is arranged in a relief duct (16) of the pump 

working space (9), residual fuel fed by the pump piston 
(6) is relieved, starting from the end of an injection-active 

controlled feed stroke of the pump piston, 
characterized in that the pump cylinder (7) is arranged 

with its axis in a radial plane (8) of a rotary-driven 
distributor (4) which is guided in a cylinder liner (3) 

inserted in the housing of the fuel injection pump, and 
there is arranged in the radial plane (8), in which the 

pump cylinder (7) lies with its axis, a cam ring (18) 
which surrounds the distributor (4) and has a cam track 

(17) which faces the pump piston (6), projecting out of 
the pump cylinder (7), and between which and the pump 

piston is arranged a pump tappet (15), and in that, when  
 

the fuel injection pump is in operation, the fuel pressure 
in the suction space (12) is always higher than the 

fluid pressure in the driving-gear space (2), so that the 
pump piston follows the cam track (17) as a result of the 

pressure difference between the suction-space pressure 
and the driving-gear-space pressure. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the movable wall (27, 36, 37) consists of 

an annular part arranged in a cylindrical annular space 
which is coaxial to the axis of the distributor (4) and 

which is at least part of the suction space (12) and of 
the driving-gear space (2). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the annular space is formed by the outer 

wall of the cylinder liner (3) and the circular-cylindrical 
inner wall of the housing (1) of the fuel injection 

pump, the said housing receiving the driving gear. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the movable wall is an elastically 

deformable wall (27, 36). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claims 1 to 3, 
chara
cterized in that the movable wall is a piston part 
(37) displaceable along the cylindrical walls of the 

annular space. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the movable wall bears, so as to 

support itself, on a supporting body (29) which is guided 
between the cylindrical walls of the annular space. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the supporting body (29) has two annular 

end-face grooves (32, 38) which face the suction space 
and in which are arranged sealing rings, on which the 

elastically deformable wall (36) comes to bear as a 
result of the difference between the pressure in the 

suction space (12) and the pressure in the driving-gear 
space (2). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the movable wall (37) has annular grooves 

(38, 39) which face the walls of the annular space and in  
 

each of which a sealing ring (40, 41) is inserted. 
Fuel injection pump according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that, on the same side 

as the cam space, the movable wall is held at least 
indirectly in bearing contact on at least one of the 

cylindrical walls of the annular space as a result of the 
difference between the pressure in the suction space (12) 

and the pressure in the cam space (2). 
Fuel injection pump according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the driving-gear 

space (2) is filled with fuel. 
Fuel injection pump according to one of the 
preceding Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the 

driving-gear space (2) is filled with lubricating oil.
