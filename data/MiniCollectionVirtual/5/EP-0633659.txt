<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave 
filter (hereinafter referred to as a SAW filter) comprising a 
plurality of interdigital transducers (hereinafter referred 
to as IDTs) which are arranged on a piezoelectric substrate 
along a surface wave propagation direction, and more 
particularly, it relates to a SAW filter having a structure 
capable of increasing the amount of attenuation in the 
vicinity of its pass band. A SAW filter is characterized in that the same is 
miniature and has steep filter characteristics. In general, 
therefore, SAW filters of various structures have been 
proposed and put into practice. Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view showing a three IDTs type 
SAW filter 1 as an exemplary conventional surface acoustic 
wave filter. The SAW filter 1 comprises three IDTs 3 to 5 
which are arranged on a rectangular piezoelectric substrate 2. 
Numerals 6 and 7 denote reflectors. In the SAW filter 1, first 
comb electrodes of the IDTs 3 and 5 are connected in common to 
define an input end, while a first comb electrode of the IDT 4 
serves as an output end. Second comb electrodes of the IDTs 3  
 
to 5 are connected to earth potentials. Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view showing another exemplary 
conventional SAW filter 8. The SAW filter 8 comprises two IDTs 
9 and 10 which are arranged on an upper surface of a 
piezoelectric substrate 2 along a surface wave propagation 
direction. Reflectors 6 and 7 are arranged on both sides of 
the IDTs 9 and 10. In such a two IDTs type SAW filter 8, first 
comb electrodes of the IDTs 9 and 10 are employed as input and 
output ends respectively. Second comb electrodes of the IDTs 
9 and 10 are connected to earth potentials. Fig. 3 is a schematic plan view showing still another 
exemplary conventional SAW filter 11. The SAW filter 11, 
called an interdigited interdigital type (hereinafter 
reffered to as IIDT type) SAW filter, comprises seven IDTs 12 
to 18 which are arranged on an upper surface of a rectangular 
substrate 2 along a surface wave propagation direction. First 
comb electrodes of the IDTs 12, 14, 16 and 18 are connected in 
common to be employed as an input end, while first comb 
electrodes of the IDTs 13, 15 and 17 are connected in common to 
be employed as an output end. Second comb electrodes of the 
IDTs 12 to 18 are connected to earth potentials respectively. In such an IIDT type SAW filter 11 which is formed by 
arranging a number of IDTs 12 to 18, it is possible to reduce 
insertion loss. As hereinabove described, various
