<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal (10) includes a contact 
section (14) extending from a body section (12), and a 

pin section (16) extending from the body section to be 
inserted into a circuit board through hole (20). The 

pin section (16) is defined by a pair of spaced apart 
opposing legs (30) each having a compliant portion (42) 

defined by a pair of arcuate beams (48) spaced apart by 
a slot (50), the arcuate beam pair at outer edges (54) 

being larger in dimension than the through hole 
diameter. Insertion compresses the arcuate beams (48) 

of each pair together generating force in a first 
direction, and compresses the legs toward each other 

generating force in an orthogonal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
electrical terminals and more particularly to terminals 
having pin sections for insertion into through holes of 
circuit boards. In the electrical connector art, various terminals 
are known which are affixed within passageways of 
connector housings, each with a contact section exposed 
at a mating face of the connector for mating with a 
complementary terminal of a mating connector, and each 
including an elongate section extending from an opposed 
mounting face of the housing for insertion into a 
corresponding through hole of a circuit board when the 
connector is mounted to a surface of the board. After 
insertion, such elongate or pin sections are commonly 
soldered to conductive material plated to the side walls 
of the through holes or to annular pads surrounding 
entrances to the through holes, defining electrical 
connections to respective circuits of the board. It is known for such pin sections to be configured 
in such a way as to define compressible spring members 
along the portions disposed within the through holes 
upon full insertion, to establish a press fit providing 
assured mechanical engagement directly against the 
plating material of the through hole which defines gas 
tight electrical connections. Such spring members also 
serve as a retention mechanism holding the connector to 
the board prior to the soldering operation thus 
obviating the need for clamps or other tooling. One such compliant pin section is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,634,819. Several various embodiments of 
pin sections all include the common principle of a pair 
or more of leg sections spaced apart to define a portion 
having an effective diameter larger than the diameter of 
the through hole of the circuit board into which the 
portion is to be inserted. Upon insertion, the spaced 
apart leg sections are urged toward each other by the  
 
walls of the through hole, under compression with 
sufficient spring strength thereafter for the portion to 
continuously exert spring bias outwardly against the 
walls of the through hole after insertion. The leg 
sections may be formed by flattening originally round 
stock and then punching an elongate slot into the 
flattened portion, or by punching an elongate slot into 
originally flat stock. Another variety is disclosed 
wherein originally flat stock is stamped to have two or 
three legs joining upper and lower integral terminal 
portions and then gently bowing the legs out of the 
plane of the stock, after which the
