<ABSTRACT>
A novel multipackage system for providing a refinish coating composition and a method for applying the same onto a substrate. The method comprises separately transporting at least one component under pressure to a proportioning device (14) which provides a controlled volumetric ratio of the components. The components of the coating composition are then mixed and coated onto the substrate at ambient temperature or, to accelerate curing, at moderate temperatures. The compositions involve new or modified existing chemistries that have a more limited pot life than conventionally formulated for commercial use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system of components for providing 
a coating composition and also a method for applying such a composition to 
refinish a substrate. In particular, the present method involves metering and 
proportioning a controlled ratio of the components of the system, prior to 
mixing. The proportioned components are then sprayed immediately onto 
the substrate. This invention is especially useful in the automotive refinish 
industry for such coatings as clearcoats, basecoats, and primers. There presently exists a variety of systems for proportioning 
components and delivering them to atomizers or dispensing equipment in 
proper ratios. For example, such systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
4,066,306; U.S. Patent No. 4,953,754; U.S. Patent No. 4,529,000; U.S. Patent 
No. 3,776,252; U.S. Patent No. 3,3,672,389; and U.S. Patent No. 3,530,873. 
Devices for proportioning coating compositions are marketed and have been 
widely used in original equipment manufacturing (OEM) of automobiles 
and other industrial equipment. However, such devices are not generally 
used in automotive refinish or body shops, where only one vehicle at a time 
is normally painted or finished. The term "automotive refinish" refers to the application of a 
finish to an automobile subsequent to the original manufacturing process. 
In the OEM factory, the metal body of an automobile is typically coated or 
painted in all assembly line process, permitting the use of coating 
compositions on a large scale which are cured at elevated temperatures, 
typically as high as 150-160° C. However, once the car has been fitted with 
plastic bumpers, rubber tires, and the like, it is no longer feasible to cure 
finishes at high temperatures. In the automotive refinish context, coatings 
normally are cured at ambient temperatures, although cure time may be 
accelerated by heating to temperatures tip to 80° C. In refinish applications, the coating material being applied to 
a substrate as a finish is typically the product of a multipackage system that  
 
has been mixed manually prior to use. In a typical two component system, 
the first package is composed primarily of an acrylic polymer containing 
crosslinking monomer units. The second package is composed of a 
crosslinking agent required to react with the polymer in the first package. 
The proper volumetric mix ratio of the components is determined by the 
proper stoichiometric ratios of the reactive parts of the components needed 
for the crosslinking reaction to take place.

<CLAIMS>
A method for applying a multicomponent 
refinish coating composition, comprising an acrylic 

polyol and an isocyanate crosslinking agent, onto the 
surface of an automotive substrate and curing the 

composition at a maximum temperature of 100
C, the method 
comprising: 


(a) supplying, in separate containers, a plurality 
of components, where at least one component is supplied 

under pressure and wherein the means for withdrawing said 
component from its container comprises a dip tube 

extending towards the bottom of the container, and the 
means for introducing pressurized comprises a one-way 

valve; 
(b) introducing the components into a volumetric 
proportioner, powered by said component pressure, for 

providing a controlled ratio of the components according 
to the stoichiometric needs of the chemistry involved; 
(c) homogenously mixing the components after 
exiting the proportioner to provide a refinish coating 

composition; and 
(d) coating the refinish coating composition onto 
the surface of an automotive substrate in order to 

refinish the same, where the coating is dried and cured;
 
   wherein the refinish coating composition per se 

is characterized by a viscosity at 25
C that doubles in 
centipoise in a time period between 10 seconds and 45 

minutes from the point of mixing. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the components 
while in said separate containers are pressurized by 

compressed air at a pressure of 20 to 80 psig. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the coating 
composition has a viscosity that doubles in centipoise  

 
within a time period between 10 seconds and 30 minutes 

from the point of mixing.
