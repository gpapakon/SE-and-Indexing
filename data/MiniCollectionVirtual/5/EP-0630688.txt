<ABSTRACT>
A rotatable outlet nozzle for use in a rotary sprinkler adapted 
to be rotatably mounted and driven in a sprinkler housing (1) and comprising 

a through-flow tube portion (13), a curved deflector wall portion merging with 
an outlet end of the tube and defining a main outlet and an auxiliary outlet (21) 

formed in the deflecting wall in a position thereof opposite the main outlet, 
the positioning and dimensions of the auxiliary outlet (21) being such that an 

auxiliary water spray emerges therefrom in a direction opposite to that of a 
main water spray emerging from said main outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of rotary sprinklers and 
more specifically it concerns a rotary sprinkler of the kind having a rotatable 
outlet nozzle. In the following description and claims rotatable outlet nozzles 
and rotors which at times are referred to as reaction swivels will be referred 
to collectively as "rotatable outlet nozzles".Rotary sprinklers having a rotatable outlet nozzle have long 
been known. Such sprinklers typically fall into different categories 
depending among others on the means for rotating the outlet nozzle. One category of such sprinklers comprise a housing with a 
water inlet and a water outlet nozzle adapted for rotating by a driving 
mechanism receiving its energy from the water inflow and successively 
transferring that energy to the rotatable outlet nozzle.  Such rotating driving mechanisms are known, for example, in 
U.S. Patent No. 2,053,673 to Stanton, disclosing a rotary sprinkler motor in 
which a drive ball is displaced within a ball race into impacting engagement 
with an impeller element of the outlet nozzle, resulting in successive 
impacts, and a substantial continuous rotation of the nozzle. As a result 
there is emitted an essentially sharply defined water stream having a 
relatively large range. Another type of such sprinklers, falling into a second category, 
typically comprise a rotor rotatably mounted with respect to an inlet portion 
formed with a through-flow tube. The rotor is provided with a deflecting 
surface adjusted to be impinged by a jet flowing axially from an outlet of 
said tube whereby, the jet is deflected laterally and the rotor is rotated. 
Such a sprinkler disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,007,586 to 
Cohen. It yet another type of rotary sprinklers, falling within a third 
category, are the hammer sprinklers in which both the rotary motion and the 
stream disruption are achieved by a hammer-impact mechanism. It is known that the precipitation distribution of the water spray 
in rotary sprinklers is not homogenous along the radius of the spray and 
therefore does not fulfil irrigation requirements and attempts have been made 
to achieve substantially uniform irrigation within a given zone. By the term "water precipitation" meant the volume of water 
dispersed over a unit area during a unit of time. The water precipitation 
distribution is directly dependant on the square of a distance (R) from the 
sprinkler. Thus, in order to obtain an ideally uniform water distribution over 
a given area, means must be provided for

<CLAIMS>
A rotatable outlet nozzle (11) for use in a rotary sprinkler 
adapted to be rotatably mounted and driven in a sprinkler housing (1) and 

comprising a through-flow tube portion (13); a curved deflector wall 
portion (18) merging with an outlet end (17) of the tube and defining a main 

outlet (19) and an auxiliary outlet (21) formed in the deflecting wall (18) in 
a position thereof opposite the main outlet (19), the positioning and 

dimensions of the auxiliary outlet (21) being such that an auxiliary water 
spray emerges therefrom in a direction opposite to that of a main water 

spray emerging from said main outlet (19) and wherein a discharge 
coefficient C as hereinbefore defined lies substantially in the range of 5 to 

40. 
A rotatable outlet nozzle (11) according to Claim 1 wherein 
said range extends between 15 and 30. 
A modification of the rotatable outlet nozzle (11) according to 
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said through-flow tube portion (13) is integral with 

said housing (1) and wherein said curved deflector wall portion (18)is 
rotatably mounted with respect thereto and extends smoothly from an outlet 

end (17) of said through-flow tube portion (13). 
A rotatable outlet nozzle (11) according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the auxiliary outlet (21) is substantially rectangular 

in shape. 
A rotatable outlet nozzle (11) according to Claim 4, wherein 
said auxiliary outlet (21) has dimensions of 2x4 mm.
