<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a photodetector with a multilayer filter. A 
light-receiving substrate (2) is mounted on a recessed 

portion of a ceramic stem (1). An electrode pad (4) is 
formed on a P-type layer (2a) of the light-receiving 

substrate (2) while another electrode pad (5) is formed on 
an N-type layer (2b) of the light-receiving substrate. An 

optical multilayer filter (30) is formed on the light-receiving 
substrate (2) except the regions of the electrode 

pads. Further, an epoxy transparent resin is poured into 
the recessed portion of the stem (1) and then cured, so 

that a resin portion (3) to cover the light-receiving 
substrate (2) is formed. The optical multilayer filter is 

formed of amorphous low refractive index films made of SiO₂ 
and amorphous high refractive index films made of TiO₂. 

The amorphous high and low refractive index films are 
alternately stacked.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photodetector
with a multilayer filter, for use in automatic exposure
systems for cameras or the like.Fig. 20 shows a silicon (Si) photodiode
conventionally used as a photodetector with a visual
sensitivity correction filter for use in automatic exposure
systems for cameras. This Si photodiode has the following
construction. A light-receiving substrate 2 is mounted on
a recessed portion la provided in a ceramic stem 1. A
transparent resin is poured into the recessed portion 1a of
the stem 1 and then allowed to cure, so that a resin
portion 3 with which the light-receiving substrate 2 is
covered is formed. A glass absorption filter 10 is
attached onto the resin portion 3. Two metallic lead pins
6 are secured through the bottom of the stem 1. Wires made
of Au are connected from the metallic lead pins 6 to
electrode pads 4, 5 formed on the light-receiving substrate
2. The glass absorption filter 10 is provided with
characteristics such as infrared rays cut-off, so that the
spectral sensitivity characteristic of the Si photodiode 
matches the visual sensitivity. Thus, it has been made
possible to measure quantity of light in man's visible
region during automatic exposure of a camera.Fig. 21 shows the optical transmittance
characteristic of the glass absorption filter 10. For the
Si photodiode to be improved in the photo detection
sensitivity, the optical transmittance of the glass
absorption filter 10 is desirably close to 100%. However,
the optical transmittance curve of the glass absorption
filter 10 used for the Si photodiode shows a maximum
transmittance in the optical transmittance bands of about
80% at the most, as shown in Fig. 21. Therefore, it is
difficult to obtain a high photo-detection sensitivity with
the glass absorption filter 10. Further, the glass
absorption filter 10 has difficulty in design change
because its characteristics depend on coloring materials.
Accordingly, there is a problem that the spectral
sensitivity characteristic of the Si photodiode cannot be
easily changed by changing the characteristics of the glass
absorption filter 10. In addition, the glass absorption
filter 10 is likely to be misted due to moisture in the air
or the like, so that there is a question about its
reliability.As a solution for such problems, two of the
inventors of the present application have recently designed 
a photodetector with a multilayer filter which is formed
directly on the surface of the light-receiving substrate
for the visual sensitivity correction
