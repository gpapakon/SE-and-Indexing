<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing intermediate
compounds for optically active 1,4-dihydropyridine
derivatives which are useful for the prevention and
treatment of ischemic heart diseases or hypertension.A 1,4-dihydropyridine compound which contains
two different carboxylic acid esters each other at the
3- and 5-positions of the dihydropyridine ring possesses
an asymmetric carbon atom at the 4-position thereof and
thus has two optical isomers. It is reported that
recent studies on biological properties of these
optically active compounds reveal differences of the
isomers in pharmacological activity, kinetics invivo
and safety (K. Tamazawa et al., J. Med. Chem., 29, 2504
(1986)). Where these compounds with an asymmetric
carbon atom are employed as pharmaceuticals, it has been
a general tendency to administer only one of the isomers
that is preferable as a pharmaceutical, under such a
consensus that any undesirable load should not be borne 
to the living body. From such a viewpoint, studies have
been focused on a process for preparing optically active
1,4- dihydropyridine derivatives. As a conventional
process for synthesis of optically active 1,4-dihydropyridine
derivatives, there is known a process for
introducing a desired ester residue into a (4R)-1,4-dihydropyridinecarboxylic
acid mono-ester as an
intermediate (A. Ashimori et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull.,
39, 108 (1991)). For preparing this optically active
intermediate, (4R)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic
acid mono-ester, there are known the chemical process by
Shibanuma et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull., 28, 2809 (1980))
and the enzymatic methods by Achiwa et al. (Tetrahedron
Letters, 32, 5805 (1991)) and by Charles J. Sih et al.
(Tetrahedron Letters, 32, 3465 (1991)). However, any
method for asymmetric direct hydrolysis of diesters by
microbiological technique is not disclosed in these
publications.The chemical synthesis of optically active
(4R)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid monoester
described above encounters disadvantages that not
only the process requires a protective group for the
amino group on the dihydropyridine ring but the formed
mono-carboxylic acid racemate requires optical
resolution since the reaction is not asymmetric
hydrolysis.On the other hand, the process by Achiwa et
al. comprises using as a substrate a dihydropyridine 
ester derivative having pivaloyloxymethyl at the 3- and
5-positions of the dihydropyridine ring, enzymatically
hydrolyzing one of the esters asymmetrically to form an
optically active
