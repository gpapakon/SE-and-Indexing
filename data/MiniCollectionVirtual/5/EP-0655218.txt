<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a physical-information
detecting system which obtains physical
information from a living subject such as a patient.A plurality of physiological- or physical-information
detecting devices such as an electrocardiograph
(ECG), a blood pressure (BP) measuring device (e.g., BP
monitor), and/or a blood oxygen saturation measuring device
(i.e., oximeter) are used by being worn on each of a
plurality of patients, so as to obtain an electrocardiogram,
a blood pressure value, and/or a blood oxygen saturation
value from the patient, respectively. The thus obtained
various sorts of physical information are processed by a
common physical-information output device, so that a visual
representation of the various sorts of physical information
is output for each patient on a display or a record sheet
and so that a medical worker observes the plural sorts of
physical information all at once.For example, a group of an ECG, a BP monitor, and
an oximeter are worn on each of patients undergoing medical
treatments in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital,
and three sorts of physical information are transmitted by 
radio, by optical communication, or alternatively by using
respective electric signals from the three detectors to a
center display device, so that the display device displays
the plural sorts of physical information for each patient,
separately from those for the other patients. With this
monitor system, a medical worker such as a doctor or a nurse
can read the plural sorts of physical information for each
patient all at once.Each of the physical-information detectors
generates a physical-information signal representing
detected physical information, and an identification signal
identifying the particular detector which provides that
physical-information signal. The common output device
processes the physical-information signal transmitted from
each detector, and outputs a visual representation of the
physical information represented by the processed signal.However, if one of the physical-information
detectors is erroneously worn on an incorrect patient who
is, for example, next to a correct patient to be monitored,
the above-indicated, prior physical-information monitor
system would output the physical information erroneously
obtained from the incorrect patient, as the physical
information of the correct patient to be monitored, because
the prior monitor system does not identify each patient but
only identifies each detector based on the identification
signal supplied together
