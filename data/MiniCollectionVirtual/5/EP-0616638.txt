A process for isolating cell ingredients, such as nucleic 
acids, from natural sources by separating the lysed natural 

sources, such as cells or cellular debris, in a sample by 
filtration, characterized in that said sample is passing a 

filter, the pore size of the filter decreasing in the 
direction of sample flow through the filter. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein the sample flow 
through the filter is promoted by applying positive or 

negative pressure, or by gravity, or by gravity increased 
by centrifugation, or by a combination of said measures. 
The process according to claim 1 and/or 2, wherein said 
nucleic acid is plasmid DNA or genomic DNA having a size of 

from 1 to 50 kb (kilo base pairs). 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that said sample is passing a filter 

composed of a multitude of layers wherein, with respect to 
a particular initial pore size, the subsequent layers have 

increasingly smaller pore sizes. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that said sample is passing a filter 

composed of one layer whose pore size decreases in the 
direction of sample flow. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that said pore size ranges from 5 µm to  

 
500 µm, the total thickness of the filter bed being from 

0.1 mm to 10 mm. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that said sample is passing a three-layered 

filter bed wherein the first filter layer has a 
pore size of from 100 to 300 µm, the second filter layer 

has a pore size of from 30 to 100 µm, and the third filter 
layer has a pore size of from 5 to 30 µm. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that said filter layers or said filter are 

composed of sintered polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluorethylene, 
glass, silica gel, alumina, or packed 

diatomaceous earth, e.g. cellite or silica gel, interwoven 
or cemented nonwovens of polypropylene, polyester, glass 

fibers and silica, as well as paper, compressed paper, or 
paper non-wovens. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein several samples are processed simultaneously in 

devices adapted to microtitration processes. 
A device for performing the process according to one of 
claims 1 to 9, wherein in a preferably cylindrical hollow 

body (40) having an inlet and an outlet (50, 60), there is 
disposed filtration means (70) consisting of a multilayered 

filter bed having decreasing pore sizes as seen in the 
direction of outlet (60), the filtration means (70) having 

a pore size ranging from 5 µm to 500 µm, the total thickness 
of the filter bed being from 0.1 mm to 10 mm. 
The device according to claim 10, characterized in that a 
hydrophobic separating layer (23) is disposed in said 

cylindrical hollow body (40).  
 
The device according to one of claims 10 and/or 11, 
characterized in that said filtration means is capable of 

being combined with other instruments necessary for the 
preparation of nucleic acids, in particular with instruments 

suitable for microtitration.
