<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for processing 
a black-and-white silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material having a silver halide light-sensitive layer provided 
on a support, and more particularly relates to a method for 
photographically processing a black-and-white silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material wherein a high contrast 
is assured without deteriorating sensitivity and occurrence of 
black spots and silver sludge is inhibited. A photographic plate-making process comprises a process 
to convert a document with a continuous tone to a dot image. 
In this process, an infectious development technology has been 
used as a photographic technology to reproduce images with a 
super high contrast.  
 A lithographic type silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material used for infectious development comprises 
of a silver bromochloride emulsion wherein an average grain 
size is 0.2 µm, for example, and grain distribution is narrow, 
a grain has a regular shape, and a silver chloride content is 
high (50 mol % or more). By processing this lithographic 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material with an 
alkaline hydroquinone developing solution having a low sulfite 
ion concentration, so-called a lithographic developing 
solution, an image with a high contrast, a high sharpness and 
a high resolution can be obtained. However, since the above lithographic developing solution 
is liable to be air-oxidized, preservability thereof is not 
sufficient. Accordingly, it is difficult to keep the quality 
of development constant in continuous running. On the other hand, methods to obtain an image with high 
contrast without using the above lithographic developing 
solution are known. For example, Japanese Patent Publication 
Open to Public Inspection No. 106244/1981 (hereinafter 
referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication) discloses a 
method to incorporate a hydrazine derivative in a silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive material and to process 
the light-sensitive material with an alkaline developing 
solution containing an amino compound. This and other methods 
make it possible to obtain high contrasted image even when the 
light-sensitive material is processed with a developing  
 
solution having high preservability and capable of processing 
rapidly. In addition, a method to incorporate a redox 
compound in a light-sensitive material for improving the 
quality of dot is disclosed in Japanese Patent O.P.I. 
Publication No. 285340/1990. In
