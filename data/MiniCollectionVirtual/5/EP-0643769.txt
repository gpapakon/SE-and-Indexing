<ABSTRACT>
A recombinant DNA molecule codes for a peptide with the antigenicity of timothy grass pollen allergens Phl p II. The amino acid sequence (5) and the most important B cell and T cell epitopes of the molecule are derived therefrom. The recombinant Phl p II allergen is expressed in Escherichia coli and binds serum IgE of more than 60 % of all those allergic to grass pollen and may therefore be used in the same way as the naturally occurring Phl p II for processes based on antigen-antibody interaction, mediator release and T cell reactivity.

<CLAIMS>
A recombinant DNA molecule, characterized in that it has a nucleic
acid sequence that codes for a polypeptide which has the antigenicity of the 
Phl p
 II
allergen (Timothy Grass pollen allergen), especially monocotyledonous plants, or for

a peptide having at least one epitope of this allergen, and a nucleic acid sequence
which hybridizes with said nucleic acid sequence under stringent conditions, where

the nucleic acid sequence is homologous to the total sequence shown in Figure 1 or
subregions thereof, or it can be derived by degeneration of the sequence shown in

Figure 1.
A recombinant DNA molecule according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it is functionally connected to an expression control sequence to form an

expression construct.
A host system, characterized in that it is transformed with a
recombinant expression construct according to claim 2.
A recombinant or synthetic protein or polypeptide derived from a
DNA molecule according to Claim 1, characterized in that it has an amino acid

sequence corresponding to that shown in Figure 1.
A recombinant or synthetic protein or polypeptide according to claim
4, characterized in that it is a fusion product having the antigenicity of the 
Phl p
 II
allergen from Timothy Grass and an additional polypeptide component, where the

entire fusion product is coded by the DNA of an expression product according to
Claim 2.
A recombinant or synthetic protein or polypeptide according to claim
5, characterized in that said additional polypeptide is Î²-galactosidase or another

polypeptide suitable for fusion.
A diagnostic or therapeutic reagent, characterized in that it contains a
synthetic protein or polypeptide according to one of the claims 4 through 6.
A method of 
in vitro
 detection of a patient's allergy to the 
Phl p
 II
allergen, characterized in that the reaction of the IgE antibodies in the patient's 

serum is measured with a recombinant or synthetic protein or polypeptide according
to one of the claims 4 through 6.
A method of 
in vitro
 detection of the cellular reaction to the 
Phl p
 II
allergen, characterized in that a recombinant or synthetic protein or polypeptide

according to one of the claims 4 through 6 is used to simulate or inhibit the cellular
reaction.
