<ABSTRACT>
A material treatment process, and particularly such a process for the destruction of waste material. The process involves pyrolysis of waste material within a plasma torch and a hot zone which receives the material stream from the torch. Waste material is injected into the torch as a fine spray and/or as a gas, and the direction of injection is generally transverse to the direction of movement of the plasma through the torch. The location of the injection is such that the waste material is injected directly into the core of the plasma. The hot zone is of a length such as to ensure complete pyrolysis of the material, and that zone is immediately followed by a cooling zone in which the material is subjected to very rapid quenching. The material stream entering the cooling zone is at a temperature above that at which CO in the material stream tends to re-form into CO2 in the material stream includes particulate carbon which is used to absorb residual toxic compounds when the material is subjected to an alkaline environment within the cooling zone and/or a scrubber following that zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal decomposition
processes such as the destruction of toxic waste matter,
and is concerned with both a process and apparatus. It will
be convenient to hereinafter particularly describe the
invention with reference to the example application to
destruction of waste matter.This invention relates particularly but not
exclusively to treatment of waste products resulting from
chemical treatment, chemical conversion and the like. These
products often contain highly toxic directly
physiologically active or carcinogenic substances. By way
of example, such products can include per- or polychlorinated
and per- or polyfluorinated aliphatic or
aromatic substances such as chlorophenols, dioxins and
furans. In addition to their toxicity, these compounds
often exhibit high chemical and thermal resistance.Waste matter destruction is becoming a problem of
great magnitude throughout the world. Two methods of
removing contaminated material have become established,
namely land fill and high temperature combustion
techniques.In the land fill technique, which generally only
applies to solids, the toxic matter is not destroyed, but
is simply stored in dumps. At best the dumps are designed
to prevent contamination of ground water by waste matter
deposited therein. This technique is not suited to some
areas, for example, areas in which there is an ongoing
danger of leakage, seepage or the like.In the high temperature combustion technique, the
generally attainable temperatures, for example up to
1500°C, are insufficient to destroy all the toxic
substances. The most thermally stable harmful substances
are thus delivered into the atmosphere. Further the
combustion process can promote the formation of additional 
dioxins and furans which are then also delivered into the
atmosphere.Thus there are disadvantages associated with each of
the techniques described above.US-A-4644877 discloses a pyrolytic waste destruction
system in which waste material is fed to a plasma burner
and exits via cylindrical member into a reaction vessel
forming a reaction chamber. Waste products exit chamber
via outlet openings for quenching in spray ring. The exit
chamber is for cooling the pyrolysed waste material to form
recombined products.According to a first aspect of this invention a
thermal decomposition process includes the steps of forming
a plasma within a pyrolyser, injecting material to be
treated as a fine spray and/or a gas into said plasma,
moving said material as a stream through said pyrolyser in
a direction
