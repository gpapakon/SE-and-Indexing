<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process of depleting the E- (trans) isomer amount in Z/E
(cis/trans) 7-amino-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid of
formula

It is known that the Z-configuration represents the characteristic which determines the
advantageous properties of cephalosporin end products in the Gram negative range.
Consequently, an active compound with the smallest possible content of E-isomer is
desired for optimum efficiency.Synthetic processes for the production of these antibiotics or intermediates thereof yield
Z-isomers in admixture with E-isomers.In example 37 of EP 0 420 608 the production of 7-β-phenylacetamido-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid-4-methoxybenzylester is described.
According to the 1H-NMR data given therein, a mixture of the Z/E-isomers is obtained.
During production of the desired active compound the isomeric mixture is retained.According to Journal of Antibiotics Vol. XLIII, No. 8, pages 1047-1050, (1990), 7-β-phenylacetamido-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid-4-methoxybenzylester
is obtained with a Z/E ratio of 4.7/1. It is pointed out that the
isomers at this stage are difficult to separate. Separation is therefore carried out at a later
stage, after removing the phenylacetyl group, reacylating with the protected side chain of
the active substance, and removing the protecting groups. In Chem. Pharm. Bull. 39(9), 2433-2436, (1991) the production of the pure Z-isomer of
7-β-phenylacetyl-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazol)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid-4-methoxybenzylester
from the resultant Z/E-isomeric mixture by partially separating the E-isomer
by crystallization and subsequently effecting chromatography on silica gel with
benzene and ethyl acetate is described. The solvent mixture used for chromatography and
the chromatography material may only be regenerated with difficulty and benzene is a
solvent, which should no longer be used due to its carcinogenity.According to reference example 1 of EP 0 236 231 the analogous benzhydrylester is
obtained in pure Z-form, but also only by use of benzene/ethyl acetate as the eluant in the
chromatography step. In reference example 1 of EP 0 175 610, the separation of the pure
Z-isomer of 7-phenoxyacetamido-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid benzhydrylester is described in the same manner.A further process for the production of the compounds of formula I, described in EP 597
429, takes place in accordance with the following reaction
