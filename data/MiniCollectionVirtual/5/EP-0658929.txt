<ABSTRACT>
A process for delaminating an organic resin insulation layer 
and a board therefor without adversely affecting the organic 

resin multi-layer wiring layer. A polyimide insulation layer 

121 is formed on a quartz glass board 111. On the polyimide 
insulation layer 121 are laminated another polyimide 

insulation layer and a wiring layer which form a first block 
100 together with the polyimide insulation layer 121. 

Irradiation from an excimer laser on the back of the quartz 
glass board 111 is performed to delaminate the first block 

100 and the quartz glass board 111. UV rays from the excimer 
laser 1 and the polyimide insulation layer 121 undergo a 

photochemical reaction to remove the polyimide insulation 
layer 121 located at the interface with the quartz glass 

board 111 and to delaminate the quartz glass board 111 from 
the first block 100.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
delaminating an organic resin from a board. In addition, the 
present invention relates to a process for manufacturing an 
organic resin multi-layer wiring board, particularly to a 
process for manufacturing an organic resin multi-layer wiring 
board by connecting a plurality of blocks. The process of delamination of organic resins from 
boards is carried out in a variety of situations during 
manufacturing of electronic parts. As an example, in a 
process for manufacturing a certain organic resin multi-layer 
wiring board, the organic resin is delaminated from the 
board. According to this manufacturing process, a plurality 
of separately manufactured blocks with wiring layers are 
connected to each other. The connected blocks are 
incorporated into a multi-layer wiring board. The blocks are 
organic resin multi-layer wiring layers. The blocks are 
laminated on a board. In preparation for connection, the 
blocks are delaminated from the boards. An instance of this 
manufacturing process is disclosed in Japanese Patent  
 
Koukai Hei No. 5-206643. The technique 
described in this gazette dissolves the board for separation 
of the block and the board. More specifically, an aluminum 
board is dissolved in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric 
acid. This delaminating technique is, however, troublesome 
in that an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid deteriorates 
the organic resin multi-layer wiring layer. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
process for delaminating an organic resin which does not 
adversely 
affect portions other than the portion to be delaminated. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for manufacturing an organic resin multi-layer 
wiring board with a high degree of reliability. A still further object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for manufacturing an organic resin multi-layer 
wiring board for a shorter term. The process for delaminating an organic resin 
according to the present invention causes a photochemical 
reaction of the organic resin to weaken the adhesive force 
between the organic resin and the board. Since the section 
of the organic resin which is in contact with the board is 
irradiated with light, it is necessary to use a board which 
transmits the light. The light applied to the board is  
 
transmitted through the board and reaches the organic resin. More concretely, the process for delaminating an 
organic resin according to the present invention includes
