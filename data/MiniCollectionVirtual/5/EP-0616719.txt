<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a buffering system and method for data recorded by a laser on a moving optical medium (52), such as a flexible optical tape. In accordance with the present invention, data (e.g., analog video information) can be buffered to permit recording on a flexible optical medium (52) in a manner which optimizes recording efficiency and space utilization on the recording medium (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to data buffering for recording and
playback systems. More particularly, the invention relates to buffering systems and
methods for use during optical writing and reading of data with respect to a storage
medium, such as a flexible optical tape in an optical video recorder (OCR).Presently, flexible tape for optical storage of data is known, as described in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,719,615 and 4,912,696, both identified on their cover pages as being
assigned to Optical Data, Inc. To optically record data on a medium such as a flexible
optical tape, a beam of laser light is directed onto the tape. The laser beam melts the tape
or burns holes in the tape to produce data spots representing bits of data. The data spots
have a reflectance, transmittance or other optical characteristic which can be distinguished
from the background of the optical tape.Presently, optically sensitive tape has not been effectively used to record high
frequency signals such as television video signals. One reason for this is the absence of
an effective laser scanning system wherein data (e.g., analog video data) arriving at a
constant input rate can be recorded uniformly (without gaps) on a medium (e.g., optical
tape) moving at a constant speed.Other known recording systems, such as facsimile systems, do not adequately
address the problem at hand. While these systems may receive input data at a constant
rate and record data on a moving paper medium, the medium is not continuously moving
at a constant speed. Rather, the medium is moved incrementally so that a marking (i.e.,
printing) mechanism can print information as it is received.Input data is received by a facsimile system during times when the marking (i.e.,
printing) is not positioned to print. Thus, the data is buffered (i.e., stored in memory) 
until the marking mechanism reaches the proper write location. The marking mechanism
is able to print at a rate equal to or faster than the input data rate.Typically, facsimile systems use at least three line-storage buffers. As input scan
lines are received, they are stored at the input rate in each of the three buffers
sequentially. Concurrently, the content of a previously loaded buffer is transferred to the
printing mechanism at the faster printing rate. Thus, there is one buffer which is
currently being filled from the input, a second buffer which is being emptied by the
printer and a third buffer which is empty awaiting filling from the input.Because emptying of the aforementioned second buffer
