<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prosthesis for long
bones and, more particularly to means for fixing such
prosthesis in place.There are two accepted methods of fixating a long bone
prosthesis during implantation. For example, with
particular regard to hip stem implantation, such implants
are either cemented or press-fit in place. Cementation of
a hip stem has a distinct advantage of initial fixation.
Press-fit stems, however, often provide for better stress
distribution as well as easier revision.Implanting a cemented hip prosthesis involves three
general steps. First, the femoral canal is prepared by
methods well known in the art. Second, a bone plug is
introduced and cemented into the femoral canal. And last,
the prosthesis is then inserted and held in place until the
cement sets.Although pressurization of the cement in the canal is
achieved by forcing the cement into the canal and then
inserting the prosthesis, the pressure is low. Since
presently used bone cement does not adhere well to a
metallic surface, state of the art techniques achieve
attachment by interdigitating the cement with a roughed or
machined stem surface and the rough internal bone and/or
bone pores. Therefore the cement adheres mainly by
mechanical means.Some authors have stated that a cement precoat of the
hip stem enhances bone strength when inserted into the
cement introduced into the femur. Davies, Singer and
Harris, "The Effect of a Thin Coating of
Polymethylmethacrylate on the Torsional Fatigue Strength of
the Cement-Metal Interface", Journal of Applied
Biomaterials, Vol. 3, 45-49 (1992). This is apparently
correct since the cement precoat is applied under pressure 
and is therefore forced into the hip stem pores more
completely and deeper than merely by inserting a hip stem
into a cement bed in the femur. However, although this
precoat technique may be better than standard cementing
techniques, it can still have problems due to potential
debonding or delaminating of the cement-cement interface.
Therefore, it is ideal to gain the pressurization of the
precoat but at the time of implantation so that the cement-prosthesis
and cement-bone interfaces are achieved by one
continuous cemented layer.Although cemented hip stems are the state of the art
standard by which other stems are measured in terms of
implantation time, without the high risk of loosening of
the stem, revisions of such stems are often quite
difficult. Removing cement from the femoral canal below
the lesser trochanter is often a long and involved
procedure.On
