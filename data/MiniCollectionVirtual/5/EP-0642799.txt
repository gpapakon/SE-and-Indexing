<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to enzymatically cleavable prodrugs with
reduced Michaelis-Menten constant (Km).A prodrug may be defined as a chemical which is non-toxic and
pharmacodynamically inert, but which can be transformed in vivo
to a pharmacologically active drug.The invention refers to the field of drug-targeting, which
deals with site-specific delivery of drugs in vivo. Site-specific
delivery preferably increases the selectivity of drugs
and reduces their undesirable side effects.One potential approach to achieve a site-specific delivery
consists in applying untoxic prodrugs which can be site-specifically
activated to cytotoxic drugs using prelocalized
prodrug cleaving catalysts like enzymes, muteins derived from
enzymes, catalytic antibodies, antibody enzyme conjugates or
fusion proteins.This approach combines the advantage of drug delivery via
prodrugs (i.e. increased stability, adjusted solubility,
improved route of administration, more favourable distribution,
improved pharmacokinetics, by-passing resistance; T.A. Connors,
Xenobiotica 16, 975-988, 1986) with the preferential tumour
specific activation mediated by a catalytic principle. The use
of exogenous enzymes or polyclonal antibody enzyme conjugates
for prodrug activation was pioneered by Graffi (Deutsche
Offenlegungsschrift 22 12 014), and Philpott et al. (J.
Immunol. 111, 921, 1973).More recently the original teaching from Graffi and Philpott
was exemplified and improved by the use of monoclonal antibody 
enzyme conjugates as prodrug activating catalysts (Bagshawe et
al., Brit. J. Cancer, 58, 700, 1988; Senter et al.,
Bioconjugate Chem. 4, 3-9, 1993) or fusion proteins (Bosslet et
al., Brit. J. Cancer, 65, 234-238, 1992; Goshorn et al., Cancer
Res. 53, 2123-2127, 1993).Despite these improvements, the systems described so far have
some major disadvantages for clinical applications:
a) monoclonal antibody enzyme conjugates produced by chemical
coupling have as a major drawback a strong immunogenicity
in man due to the xenogenic origin of the antibody moiety
and the enzyme (Bagshawe et al., Disease Markers 9: 233-238,
1991). As a consequence of this high immunogenicity
repetitive applications in man are possible only to a very
limited extent;b) fusion proteins consisting of non-humanised binding
moieties and xenogenic enzymes produced by recombinant DNA
technology will be immunogenic in man as well with
disadvantages comparable to monoclonal antibody enzyme
conjugates, if repetitive applications are needed;c) fusion proteins consisting of
