<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
performing computing operations according to the neural network
theory. More particularly, the invention relates to a
nonlinear operation unit of simple circuit constructions and
improved accuracy, and a data processing apparatus using the
nonlinear operation units.A neural-network basis apparatus having the functions
of computing operations, storage, learning and the like has
been realized by circuits and operation means, which are
modeled on each neuron. The fact that most of the outputs of
nerves become the inputs of other nerves has been well known.
Also in the neural-network basis apparatus, the output signal
of the circuit and the operation means, which are modeled on a
neuron, frequently become the input signal of the circuit and
operation means, which are modeled on another neuron. By
convention, a neural network is constructed by combining those
neuron circuits and operation means. Accordingly, the neural
network includes the neuron circuits and operation means, which
are necessary for forming each neuron but are omissible in
light of constructing the overall network. In other words, the 
conventional neural network must include unnecessary circuits
and operation means.The neuron linearly multiplies the signals from other
neurons in accordance with a strength of bonding of synapses
for transferring the signals, adds the results of multiplying
operations from the synapses of the neuron to the threshold
value of the neuron, and transfers the output signals, which
are equivalent to the results of the process carried out by the
nonlinear function, to other neurons, through the synapses.
The conventional art constructs the neuron circuits and
operation means in a similar order. An example of this is
described in "High-Speed Analog Neural Network LSI for Neuro
Processing Type Light Demultiplexes",
Electric/Electronics/Information/Communication Academy NC90-53
(Article 1). The synapses of each neuron are constructed by a
circuit corresponding to a linear multiplier circuit, invented
by Gilbert and disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. Sho. 48-20932 (Article 2). The output currents
of the synapses are added together. Then, a nonlinear
characteristic is gained by a differential amplifier. The
current is converted into a corresponding voltage, which is
then used as an output signal of the neuron. A neural
circuitry based on the neural circuitry theory is constructed
by connecting the circuits modeled on the neurons. When
