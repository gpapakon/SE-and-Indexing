<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust gas purification device of the 
present invention includes a three-way reducing and 

oxidizing catalyst (12) disposed on an exhaust passage (14) of 
an engine (1) and an NO
x
 absorbent (16) 
which absorbs NO
x
 in 
the exhaust gas when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust 

gas is lean and releases absorbed NO
x
 when the air-fuel 
ratio of the exhaust gas is rich; the engine (1) in 

the present invention is controlled in most of its 
operating region in such a manner that the operating 

air-fuel ratio of the engine oscillates between a rich 
air-fuel ratio and a lean air-fuel ratio about a 

center value of a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio; when 
the operating air-fuel ratio of the engine (1) becomes 

lean, the ability of the three-way catalyst (12) for 
reducing NO
x
 in the exhaust gas becomes low, and a 
part of NO
x
 in the exhaust gas passes through the 
three-way catalyst, and, since the air-fuel ratio of 

the exhaust gas is lean, this NO
x
 is absorbed in the 
NO
x
 absorbent (16) located downstream of the three-way 
catalyst (12); when the operating air-fuel ratio of the 

engine becomes rich, the ability of the three-way 
catalyst (12) for oxidizing HC and CO in the exhaust gas 

becomes low, and a part of HC and CO in the exhaust 
gas passes through the three-way catalyst (12); since the 

air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, absorbed 
NO
x
 is released from the NO
x
 absorbent and 
this NO
x
 is reduced as HC and CO passes through the three-way 
catalyst (12); therefore, the pollutants such as HC, CO, 

NO
x
 are almost completely removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust 
gas purification device for an internal combustion engine. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to a device 
which is capable of effectively removing an NOX 
component from exhaust gas of the engine. An exhaust gas purification device used for 
engines mainly operated with a lean air-fuel ratio (such 
as lean burn gasoline engines) to remove NOX (nitrogen 
oxide) components in the exhaust gas is disclosed in 
WO93-07363 corresponding to EP-A-0 560 991. The device utilizes an NOX absorbent which 
can absorb an NOX component in the exhaust gas when the 
air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and can 
release absorbed NOX when the oxygen concentration in 
the exhaust gas becomes low. In the knwon device 
the NOx absorbent is disposed in the exhaust 
passage of a lean burn engine. Since the air-fuel ratio 
of the exhaust gas in the most part is lean in the lean 
burn engine, the NOX absorbent usually absorbs the NOX 
components in the exhaust gas so that the NOX component 
is removed from the exhaust gas. When the amount of the 
NOX absorbed in the NOX absorbent increases, the air-fuel 
ratio of the engine is lowered to make the air-fuel 
ratio of the exhaust gas rich. When the air-fuel ratio 
of the exhaust gas becomes rich, the oxygen 
concentration in the exhaust gas becomes low and, at the 
same time, the concentration of HC and CO components in 
the exhaust gas becomes higher, therefore, NOX absorbed 
in the NOX absorbent is released from the absorbent and 
reduced to N2 by the HC and CO components in the exhaust 
gas.  
 By repeating the above procedure during engine 
operation, the NOX component in the exhaust gas is 
almost completely removed by the device in EP-A-0 560 991. As stated above, the NOX absorbent can absorb NOX 
in the exhaust gas when the air-fuel ratio of the 
exhaust gas is lean. However, it is necessary that an 
oxygen component exists in the exhaust gas when the NOX 
absorbent absorbs NOX in the exhaust gas. Therefore, 
when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lower than 
a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, i.e., when the air-fuel 
ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, the NOX absorbent 
cannot absorb the NOX in the exhaust gas since the 
concentration of the oxygen in the exhaust gas is too 
low. Therefore, when the known exhaust gas purification 
device is applied to engines mainly 
operated near the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, such as 
the engines in which an air-fuel ratio oscillates between a 
rich air-fuel ratio
