<ABSTRACT>
A multi-colour wire marker (2) comprises a base (4), 
a slideway (14), a carriage housing (6) to which are 

mounted rollers (20,22) for respectively feeding and 
gathering hot foil coloured tape (18), a main ram housing 

(8) and an anvil (10) against which a wire (12) to be 
marked is supported. A plurality of rollers carrying 

different coloured tapes (18) are mounted on the carriage 
housing (6) whereby any one of the coloured tapes (18) can 

be chosen to mark the wire (12) by indexably moving the 
carriage housing (6) until the appropriate tape (18) is 

lying between the ram (26) and the anvil (10). The ram 
(26) which is heated to an adjustable temperature is then 

pressed against the tape (18) which presses the wire (12) 
against the anvil (10), the heat and pressure making 

coloured products mounted on the tape (18) melt off and 
colour mark the wire (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-colour wire marker,
and in particular, for marking mono-coloured insulated
wire with hot foil coloured tape.It is often desirable in the electric cable industry
to have insulated electrical wires with specific markings
that distinguish one insulated wire from another. This
is especially so, if confusion is to be avoided when
connecting different electrical devices with electrical
conductors stemming from the same cable harness. One of
the most effective means of distinguishing between wires
is to mark them with different colours.Cable harness leads are often prepared by an
automated process whereby a cable making machine, for
example, feeds electrical conducting wires from a barrel,
cutting the various wires into their required lengths and
terminating the ends by crimping to a connector or leaving
the ends free. Some automated cable makers feed
simultaneously from a multitude of barrels that have
different coloured electrical conducting wires, and there
is therefore no need to mark the wire during preparation
of the lead. A more cost effective way, however, of
producing leads is to use a cable making machine that
feeds off only one barrel of mono coloured electrical
conducting wire. This means however, that if
distinguishable marking is required on the various wires
of a lead, then some sort of marking process must be
coupled to the lead maker.There are many ways of preparing colour marked leads,
one common way being the use of hot foil tape, whereby a
meltable coloured product mounted on foil tape is
deposited on the wire with heat and pressure. In
presently designed colour marking machines the wire is
moved to the corresponding colour station for marking. 
This movement of the wire required for marking makes it
impossible for the wire to be simultaneously marked and
prepared in the lead maker. Simultaneous preparation of the
lead and colouring of the respective wires would be
advantageous as it reduces the cycle time require to produce
the lead.FR-A-2 513 002 discloses a multiple colour wire marker
comprising a base and a plurality of cassettes with a pair
of spools on which are wound coloured tapes. The cassettes
are manually mountable and removable with respect to a wire
driving support of the base so that different coloured marks
may be deposited on the wire. The cassettes can be placed
at different positions parallel to the wire, whereby the
position of the marks deposited on the wire correspond to
the position of the tapes.With respect to the above mentioned

<CLAIMS>
A method of marking a wire (12) with multiple colours,
comprising the step of holding the wire (12) in a static

position with respect to a base (4) of a multiple colour

wire marker (2) having a carrier (6) of a plurality of
depositable coloured products (19) for depositing on the

wire (12);

   and being characterised by:-

   indexably moving the carrier (6) with respect to the
base (4) in a direction parallel to the held wire (12), such

that any of said coloured products (19) on the carrier (6)
is capable of being deposited in a predetermined position on

a portion of said held wire (12).
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the coloured
products (19) are disposed on the carrier (6) side by side

along an axis (21) parallel thereto.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein pressure
and heat are applied, through a hot foil tape (18) of the

marker (2) upon which one of the coloured products (19) is
mounted, to the wire (12) so as to cause the coloured

product (19) to dismount from the tape (18) and bond onto
the wire (12).
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein each of the hot
foil tapes (18) is fed off respective feed rollers (20) that

are individually indexable so that only the one or more
tapes (18) that have been used to mark the wire (12) are

individually indexably gathered by a respective waste roller
(22).
A method as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein an
approximately constant tension is applied to the tape (18)

during marking of the wire (12) therewith. 
A multiple colour wire marker comprising a base (4)
relative to which a wire (12) to be marked is intended to be

held in a static position, and a carrier (6) for supporting
a plurality of coloured products (19) for depositing on the

wire (12), characterised in that the carrier (6) is
indexably movable with respect to the base (4) in a

direction parallel to the wire (12) to be marked when said
wire (12) is held in said static position, such that any of

said coloured products (19) is capable of being deposited in
a predetermined position on a portion of said held wire

(12).
A marker as claimed in claim 6, wherein the base (4)
has a slideway (14) firmly attached thereto, the slideway

(14) having a slide (15) to which the carrier (6) is mounted
such that the carrier (6) is slidably movable therealong.
A marker as claimed in claim 6 or 7, including an anvil
(10) against which the wire (12) is intended to lie in said

static position, and a heatable ram (26) movable against
said anvil (10) so that pressure and heat can be applied to

the wire (12) through a hot foil tape (18) upon which one of
the coloured products (19) is mounted, thereby causing the

coloured product (19) to dismount from the tape (18) and
bond onto the wire (12).
A marker as claimed in claim 8, wherein the anvil (10)
has a piston (27) to control the pressure applied on the

wire (12) against the ram (26).
A marker as claimed in claim 8 or 9, wherein the
carrier (6) includes feed rollers (20) and associated waste

rollers (22) for supporting the hot foil tapes (18), said
feed rollers (20) being individually indexable, so that the

one or more tapes (18) that have been used to mark the wire
(12) can be individually indexably gathered by their

associated waste roller (22). 
A marker as claimed in claim 8, 9 or 10, including
adjustable tension bars (24) arranged to span the tape (18)

across the wire (12) and to maintain an adjustable and
approximately constant tension on the tape (18) during

marking of the wire (12) therewith.
