<ABSTRACT>
For emulating an ASIC type microcomputer including a central 
processing unit, a user specific peripheral function unit and a user specific 

logic circuit, which are integrated together on a single chip, an emulation 
system system includes a first integrated circuit for emulating the central 

processing unit, and second and third integrated circuits each of which is 
constituted of the ASIC type microcomputer. Each of the second and 

third integrated circuits can selectively operate in a first evaluation chip 
mode in which the central processing unit and the user specific logic 

circuit are isolated from an internal bus and in a second evaluation chip 
mode in which the central processing unit and the user specific peripheral 

function unit are isolated from the internal bus. The first integrated 
circuit is connected through an peripheral bus to the internal bus of each 

of the the second and third integrated circuits. The second integrated 
circuit is put in the first evaluation chip mode for emulating the 

peripheral function unit, ad the third integrated circuit is put in the 
second evaluation chip mode for emulating the logic circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a emulation system, and more
specifically to a microcomputer emulation system which makes it easy to
construct an emulation chip set.At present, demands for microcomputer-applied electronic
instruments including home electronic instruments and office automation
instruments are increasing. These electronic instruments are rapidly
becoming high performance and high function, and also remarkable in
versatility. As a result, it has become necessary that microcomputers have
a specification specialized to each of makers of the electronic instruments
and further specialized to each of the electronic instruments themselves.On the other hand, competition among makers becomes fierce more
and more. Therefore, in order to shorten a turn-around time (TAT) in a
product development, a development tool including a microcomputer
emulation system for assisting development and debugging of user's
programs has become important in the process of developing a
microcomputer-applied system.At present, microcomputers specialized to application fields and/or
application systems are mainly constituted of a ASIC (application specific 
integrated circuit) microcomputer in which a high performance CPU is
integrated as a core element on a single chip together with various
peripheral function units suitable or specialized to a maker or user.In the prior art, therefore, the above mentioned microcomputer
emulation system has been developed, for each developed microcomputer,
together with a special evaluation chip which is to be provided in the
emulation system and which performs the same operation as that of the
developed microcomputer. Accordingly, it has been necessary to provide
a similar evaluation chip for the ASIC type microcomputer.For efficiently realizing the above mentioned demand, there has
been known one method of preparing a CPU evaluation chip constituted
of a CPU core unit used in common to various products and a peripheral
evaluation chip constituted of a peripheral function unit which is different
in each of products, and then providing a chip-set structure composed of
the CPU evaluation chip and the peripheral evaluation chip.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown one example of the above
mentioned chip-set structure of the emulation system. The shown
emulation system is generally designated with Reference Numeral 100,
and comprises a CPU evaluation chip 101 including therein a CPU 104A.
This CPU 104A performs the same operation as that of an internal CPU
included in a actual developed
