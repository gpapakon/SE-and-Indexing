<ABSTRACT>
In the case of known methods and apparatuses for checking printed circuit boards, a video camera is passed over the printed circuit boards at a constant speed, and the printed circuit boards are intermittently illuminated in synchronism with the speed of motion. In addition, it is known for those points on the printed circuit board which are relevant to the inspection to be determined from the existing design data. A combination of movement while the image is being recorded and an increased variable speed of motion between the recording of two images is used in the case of the present invention in order to increase the inspection speed in comparison with the known prior art.

Method for inspecting printed circuit boards using at 
least one electronic camera, in which 


the printed circuit board is briefly illuminated for 
every picture record, 
the camera covers only a part of the printed circuit 
board in each picture record, 
for the picture record, camera or printed circuit 
board are moved to specified points, the specified 

points being set and determined by structures to be 
inspected on the printed circuit board, and 
the image signals generated by the camera are 
evaluated by a downstream image processing unit, 
 
characterized 


in that the picture record is made while camera and 
printed circuit board are moving at a velocity 

relative to one another, the velocity being set by the 
resolution of the camera and the duration of the 

illumination, and 
in that the movement of camera or printed circuit 
board to the specified points takes place at a 

velocity which is set by the distance of two adjacent 
specified points from one another, the velocity during 

the picture record and the acceleration and 
deceleration properties of camera or printed circuit 

boards. 
Arrangement for inspecting printed circuit boards, 
comprising 


at least one video camera (5), 
a stroboscope or a flashbulb (3), 
a device for moving the printed circuit boards and the 
video camera relative to one another, 
a measuring device (4) for measuring the coordinates, 
resulting from the relative movement, of the video 

camera with respect to the printed circuit boards,  
 
a picture processing device (2) which generates, by 
means of design data, the coordinates of the points to 

be inspected on the printed circuit boards and 
evaluates the signals of the video camera, and 
an evaluation device (1) which triggers (K) the 
picture record if the measured (W) and generated (D) 

coordinates agree, 
 
characterized 


in that the evaluation device (1) drives the movement 
device in such a way that the printed circuit boards and 

the video camera (5) are moved relative to one another 
during the illumination period of the stroboscope or of the 

flashbulb (3) by a distance which is less than the pixel 
width of the video camera (5), and 
in that the evaluation device (1) drives the movement 
device in such a way that the printed circuit boards and 

the video camera (5) are moved relative to one another at a 
higher velocity between the individual picture records, the 

evaluation device (1) determining the velocity to be set in 
each case in accordance with the distances, known from the 

generated coordinates (D) of adjacent points from one 
another on the printed circuit board, the velocity during 

the picture record and the acceleration and deceleration 
properties of the movement device. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the stroboscope or the flashbulb (3) do not have any 

relative movement with respect to the printed circuit 
boards, and in that the illumination at the respective 

points to be scanned takes place by means of one or more 
optical waveguides connected to the stroboscope or the 

flashbulb lamp. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the video camera (5) is reset to a 

new picture frame before each illumination by the 
evaluation device (1).
