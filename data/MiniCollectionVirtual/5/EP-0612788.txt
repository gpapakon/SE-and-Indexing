<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to plastisols containing, as gellable compositions, copolymers CP having a glass transition temperature above 35 degrees C, a degree of polymerisation of greater than 400 and an average particle size of from 0.05 to 500  mu m, where the copolymers CP are built up from   A) from at least 30 to 95% by weight, based on the CP, of (meth)acrylic acid esters of formula I,

  in which     R1 is hydrogen or methyl and R2 is an optionally branched alkyl radical or a cycloalkyl radical having 1 to 7 carbon atoms or is phenyl or naphthyl,   B) from 5 to at most 70 % by weight, based on the CP, of fatty acid esters of vinyl alcohols of the formula II

  in which R3 is an optionally branched alkyl radical having 5 to 20 carbon atoms, and C) from 0 to 15 % by weight of one or more functionalised monomers,   and an organic plasticiser W which is compatible with the copolymers CP in an amount of from 5 to 400 parts by weight, based on the plastisols, and also inorganic fillers in amounts of from 0 to 700 parts by weight, based on the plastisols.
