<ABSTRACT>
A full automatic coating system includes an endless 
metal tape (1) driven to run in one direction along an endless 

traveling path, a product supplying station (2) for 
automatically selecting products of a desired type and 

supplying them to the endless metal tape (1) according to a 
production control procedure stored in a control unit (6), 

a coating station (3) disposed in the traveling path downstream 
of the product supplying station (2) and including 

a spray gun (3a) for selectively spraying one of coatings 
of different colors according to instructions received from 

the control unit (6), a drying and baking station (4) and a 
coating removing station (5) disposed in the traveling path 

downstream of the coating station (3) in the order named. 
All the components (1-5) are linked to operate in timed 

relation to one another according to the instructions received 
from the control unit (6). The coating system thus 

constructed is compact in size, inexpensive to manufacture, 
and capable of automatically coating such a small quantity 

of products which conventionally required manual coating 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a full automatic
coating system which is capable of coating small quantities
of products of various different types and which can be
reduced in size.Various techniques for continuously coating large-sized
articles, such as automobile bodies and door panels,
have become established. Insofar as the large-sized articles
are concerned, the coating cost can be included in the
overall price of the individual articles. It is therefore
possible to coat or paint individual custom-made products by
manual painting operation by a painter. However, for various
small-sized components used in automobiles, a continuous
coating system constructed to coat individual components
one by one is not suitable from the economical point of
view. Accordingly, the small-sized components are usually
coated in lots.The circumstances described above with respect to
the small-sized components are also applied to the field of 
slide fasteners. When a slide fastener of a particular type
and having a particular color is to be manufactured in great
amounts, it is possible to use a continuous production system
using a large-sized equipment set in a plant. Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. 42-8132, for example, discloses
a coating jig for slide fastener sliders. The disclosed jig
includes a rectangular frame provided with hooks and having
a plurality of slider attachment plates mounted thereon in
an arrangement as of sloping fins of a louver. Each of the
slider attachment plates has a plurality of regularly spaced
slider attachment portions. A number of sliders are attached
to the slider attachment portions of all of the
slider attachment plates, and front and rear sides of the
respective sliders are coated while the hooks of the coating
jig are properly supported. By using the coating jig together
with a coating apparatus or system in the plant, a large
quantity of components (sliders) can be continuously coated.In recent years the tastes of general consumers
have varied widely, and a decorative demand has increased
even against notions used not only on garments but also on
bags. Such a decorative demand has also extended to the
field of slide fasteners, and it has become increasingly
difficult to meet the color requirements regarding all the
slide fasteners to be manufactured, only by means of the
existing colors. There is an extreme instance where a very 
small quantity (20 to 40 pieces) of slide fasteners having a
special color should be manufactured. To meet such an extreme
demand, the manufacturer
