<ABSTRACT>
A method for improving the total production of useful energy 
in an energy utilisation system of a thermal power engine (1) 

that is liquid-cooled and is used for the production of 
thermal energy as well as mechanical energy. In the 

utilisation system thermal energy is taken from the coolant 
of the engine cooling system. At least a part of the coolant 

from the engine is led to a vaporisation area (5) where, 
either by lowering the pressure or by increasing the amount 

of thermal energy within that area (5), a part of the coolant 
is transformed to vapour. The vapour is used within the 

energy utilisation system for energy transport and/or as a 
medium for recovering energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the
preamble of claim 1 for improving the total production of
useful energy of an internal combustion engine producing heat
and mechanical energy, herein sometimes referred to as a
"thermal power engine" and to an engine intended for the
application of this method.When using some thermal power engines, such as for
example large diesel engines, a significant part of the energy
content of the fuel consumed will not be used for useful
purposes, because, in the cooling system of the engine, it
only raises the temperature of the coolant to a level of some
80 to 85°C and it is difficult to find a useful application
for waste heat at such low temperature values. In some rather
large plants employing thermal power engines the thermal
energy of the coolant has however been used, by means of heat
exchangers, to produce, for example, warm water (e.g. warm
process water) or for district heating applications.JP-A-5853608 discloses a known waste heat utilising system in which cooling
water from an engine is supplied to a flush tank where steam is generated. No mechanism is
disclosed for maintaining a higher coolant pressure in the engine than in the tank. Furthermore the
system does not disclose an energy efficient system in which the cooling system remains in balance.An aim of this invention is to create a thermal power
engine, for example a diesel engine, in which it is possible
to utilise the heat energy produced in a more efficient
manner. The aim of the invention is achieved by the means
stated in claim 1. By vaporising for example some of the
coolant used in a diesel engine, a part of its thermal energy
is absorbed as heat of vaporisation. Vapour is a medium, the
contained thermal energy of which can be quite effectively
utilised by known methods. The partial vaporisation is
obtained either by lowering the pressure or by bringing more
thermal energy to the vaporisation area. This takes place
preferably in a separate area outside the thermal power
engine, but vaporising may also theoretically take place by
using heat produced by the engine in the cooling system of the
engine, although this method of operating requires that the
vaporisation process takes place in such a part of the engine
and under such good control that it is not harmful or 
dangerous to the functioning of the engine.It is of advantage to build thermal power engines
intended to operate according to the invention as rather large
units, having normally an output power of the order of
magnitude of some
