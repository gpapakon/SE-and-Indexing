<ABSTRACT>
An applicator suitable for applying a substance to a 
substrate, which applicator has a surface having a first 

wetting angle and a first surface area, which surface has 
grafted thereto a layer whose surface has a second wetting 

angle and a second surface area, wherein the second wetting 
angle is less than the first wetting angle and the second 

surface area is greater than the first surface area. Such 
applicators may be made by treatment of their original 

surface with an ion-producing gas plasma, according to 
known methods, and show significant improvements in 

laydown, pickup and application over untreated applicators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to applicators such as 
brushes, sponge-like absorbent applicators, and the like 
which have been surface-modified, for example by treatment 
with ion-producing gas plasma to improve adherence, 
wettability and other desirable characteristics. Various techniques for altering the surface 
characteristics of polymeric materials with a reactor gas 
in the presence of an electromagnetic field are known. For 
example, U.S. patent specification no. 4 072 769 teaches a 
technique for modifying the surface of shaped, polymeric 
materials using a reactor gas of N2O, water vapour, and the 
vapour of an organic compound. Another such technique is 
disclosed in U.S. patent specification no. 4 508 781, 
wherein the surfaces of synthetic or natural polymers are 
fluorinated by treatment thereof with inorganic fluorides 
in a cold glow discharge reactor. U.S. patent 
specification no. 4 925 698 teaches the fluorination of 
polymeric materials used in the manufacture of contact 
lenses. U.S. patent specification no. 5 108 667 discloses 
the fluorination of polymeric lipstick moulds which 
ultimately yield lipsticks with improved surface 
properties. U.S. patent specifications nos. 5 200 172 and  
 
4 978 524 teach the fluorination of cosmetic products such 
as lipsticks which provides them with a uniform, high gloss 
finish. In general, the prior art techniques for plasma 
treatment have been limited to hard materials such as 
plastics, steel, iron and, more recently, cosmetics. 
However, we have hitherto had no knowledge of the surface 
treatment of applicators such as brushes, sponge-like 
applicators and the like. Further, it has most 
unexpectedly been discovered that plasma treatment of 
various applicators provides an applicator with improved 
hold, wettability, pickup, laydown, release and 
application. The term "laydown" means the degree and ease with 
which an applicator releases its load of substance to be 
applied. The term "pickup" means the degree to which an 
applicator is able to take up the substance to be applied 
when it is dipped into the substance or scraped or rubbed 
against the substance. The term "application" means the way in which an 
applicator applies the substance to a surface. It is most 
desirable to have very smooth, even application without the 
clumping or streaking which is characteristic of natural 
fibre applicators. However, synthetic applicators  
 
generally do not provide a smooth, even application of the 
substance. The invention provides an applicator
