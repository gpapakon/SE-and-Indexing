<ABSTRACT>
Described are the preparation of compounds of the formula RCFXC(O)Cl, in which X represents fluorine or chlorine and R represents fluorine or a perfluorinated C1-C10-alkyl radical, preferably of chlorodifluoroacetyl chloride, by photochemical oxidation of R122 (CF2ClCHCl2) and the preparation of trifluoroacetyl chloride by photochemical oxidation of R123 (CF3CHCl2) with oxygen under irradiation. The reaction is preferably carried out without pressure and without an addition of elemental chlorine.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of compounds of
the general formula RCFXC(O)Cl, in which X is fluorine

or chlorine and R is fluorine or a perfluorinated
C1-C10-alkyl radical, by reaction of RCFXCHCl
2
, in which
R and X have the above meaning, with oxygen in the gas

phase under activating irradiation, with the proviso
that the reaction is carried out continuously without

addition of elemental chlorine and unpressurized.
Process according to Claim 1 for the preparation
of compounds of the formula CF
2
XC(O)Cl, in which X
is Cl, F, hence of trifluoroacetyl chloride and of

chlorodifluoroacetyl chloride, characterized in that
1,1-difluoro-1,2,2-trichloroethane (R122) or

1,1,1-trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane (R123) is used.
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the reaction is carried

out at a temperature of up to 200°C, preferably in a
temperature range from 80 to 130°C.
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the process is carried

out continuously by feeding the gaseous starting
material, preferably gaseous 1,1-difluoro-1,2,2-trichloroethane

or 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane,
and oxygen into a reaction vessel and continuously

taking the product from the reaction vessel, with the
average residence time in the reaction vessel being

between 0.1 and 30 minutes.
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the molar ratio between

the starting compound and oxygen (O
2
) is in the range
from 1:1 to 1:20.
