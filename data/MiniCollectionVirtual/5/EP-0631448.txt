<CLAIMS>
Method for supporting test procedures in a
communication installation (K), where

configuration data for the communication
installation or input data which trigger test

routines and also test program routine data are
respectively displayed under visible control in a

segment of a screen,
characterized

in that
 at least one further screen segment (APW)
is produced on the screen, which screen segment

displays, under visible control, current
subscriber-line-related data for the communication

installation's line components associated with the
test mode and also current operating states or

signalling operations in the communication
installation as stipulated by program procedures.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the current subscriber-line-related data
are displayed under priority-related control.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 subscriber-specific display texts are
reproduced in the screen segment (APW). 
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 ringing signalling and tone signalling are
displayed within the screen segment (APW) on a

subscriber-specific basis.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the subscriber states "busy", "connected"
and "cleared" are displayed within the screen

segment (APW).
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the screen segment (APW) is automatically
matched to the data which are to be displayed.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the display information is checked within
a time frame.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the number of screen segments (APW) is
based on or can be predetermined in accordance

with the scope of connection set-up.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the data displayed in screen segments
(APW) are evaluated by a further program module

(VS).
