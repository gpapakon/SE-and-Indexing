<ABSTRACT>
A process for packaging coffee, comprising a grinding phase of the 
coffee coming from silos (1), a forming phase of flexible or 

semi-rigid containers (7) and a phase of filling such containers (7) 
with the coffee and subsequent sealing of the pack, in which, during 

the container (7) forming phase, the containers are preliminarily 
filled with gas and at the same time closed at their top, in such a 

way as to be able to be opened again immediately before filling, 
which takes place in an atmosphere controlled by means of a rain of 

gas, the gas used for preliminarily filling the containers (7) 
and/or for controlling the atmosphere during the container filling 

phase, is drawn from the coffee grinding plant. The invention also 
refers to an installation for putting such process into effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a process and a related installation 
for packaging coffee in hermetic semirigid or flexible containers, 
by means of the use of gas and without carrying out any vacuum 
creating operation. Usually, when grounds coffee is packaged in hermetic flexible 
containers, in order to keep the shape and to preserve the coffee, 
it is obligatory to carry out an operation to create a vacuum inside 
the container, so as to give it the necessary compactness and to 
allow the quantities of oxygen inside the pack to be kept low, which 
is an essential condition for ensuring proper preservation until the 
moment it is used. This process is extremely complex and requires very expensive 
systems, since it needs the coffee to be partially or completely 
degassed beforehand and to be left for a certain length of time in 
suitable silos. The said degassing can possibly be accelerated by washing with gas. After this the coffee must be packaged in rather complicated and 
expensive systems, since it has to undergo the vacuum process. Although this technique is rather expensive, it is very widespread,  
 
since it allows the coffee to be preserved well before it is used. 
However, once the pack is opened the quality of the product falls 
off very rapidly, since it absorbs the air outside and quickly tends 
to oxidize. There have also been proposals for non-vacuum packaging coffee, but 
in the presence of gas of the product itself. US-A-4 069 349 describes a process for packaging coffee in containers 
which are stored for a certain time so that substantially all of the 
gases evolving from the coffee evacuate the container and thereafter 
hermetically sealing the container. However, these techniques have proved to be unsatisfactory, since it 
is not guaranteed that the product will remain in a gas atmosphere, 
because it is usually introduced into the container in the presence 
of air. The aim of the invention is to eliminate the above-mentioned 
drawbacks, by providing a process and relative installation for 
packaging coffee in a total gas atmosphere, thus ensuring excellent 
preservation of the product and the preservation of its qualities 
even after the pack has been opened for a considerable time. This aim is achieved, with the process according to the invention, 
by foreseeing the letting in of gas of the product itself into the 
container in its forming phase, such gas being conveniently 
recovered from the grinding plant, and by closing the pack 
temporarily, which is re-opened for being

<CLAIMS>
A process for packaging coffee in flexible or semi-rigid 
containers (7), comprising the following phases; 


forming a container (7) open at the top, around a mandrel (20) 
starting from a strip of sheet material (21) with one or more 

layers; 
filling the container (7) with coffee; 
sealing the upper part of the container by means of welding and 
subsequent creasing,
 
characterized in that the said container (7), in the forming phase, 

is filled with gas and temporarily closed at its top, to be opened 
again later immediately before the product filling phase. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
filling of the container (7) with the product is carried out in a 

controlled gas atmosphere. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the gas used for the preliminary filling of the container (7) and/or 

for controlling the phase of filling the container with coffee is 
drawn from container silos (1) and from a grinding plant (3) of the 

coffee itself. 
A process according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
said gas drawn from the silos (1) and from the grinding plant (3) is 

passed into a compensation chamber (12). 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the  
 

said container (7) is temporarily closed at its top, after being 
filled with gas, by means of creasing and spot-welding, and is 

subsequently opened for filling with coffee, by means of a sucker 
system (41). 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
said container (7), after being filled with gas, is closed at its 

top by welding, and is subsequently opened by trimming before 
filling with coffee. 
An installation for packaging coffee, comprising: 

coffee container silos (1); 
a grinding plant (3); 
a filling and packing plant (6); 
a plant (8) for forming empty containers (7),
 
characterized in that the said forming plant (8) comprises a hollow 

mandrel (20) through which a gas is fed, by means of a pipe (27) 
for preliminarily filling with said gas the container (7), which is 

temporarily closed at its top by closing means, and in that the said filling plant 
(6) is contained in a micro-chamber (40) with atmosphere controlled 

by a rain of gas and comprises means for opening the top 
of the container immediately before the product filling 

phase. 
An installation according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the gas for filling the container (7) in the forming plant (8) 

and/or for controlling the atmosphere of the micro-chamber (40), is 
drawn from the said silos (1) and grinding plant (3), with a 

possible intermediate compensation chamber (12) and storage 
cylinders (15). 
An installation according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the said micro-chamber (40) is contained in a secondary chamber  

 
(50) with drawing off of excess gas.
