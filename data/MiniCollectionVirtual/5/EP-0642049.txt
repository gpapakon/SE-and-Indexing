<ABSTRACT>
A pair of polarization plates (9 and 10) are arranged outside a liquid crystal display which uses a flexible 
sub
strate such as a plastic film. An edge of at least one of the plates is extended to the area where the electrode terminal terminal 
part is provided on the substrate (2). By enhancing the mechanical strength of the part (7), the terminal electrodes 

do not crack by the mechanical stress in fabricating the liquid crystal display and in incorporating the display into 
an electronic device. In this way, disconnection hardly occurs, making it possible to provide a highly reliable liquid 

crystal display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display which uses flexible substrates, as well 
as to an electronic device that includes said liquid crystal display. The structure of conventional liquid crystal displays that use flexible substrates such as plastic 
films will be explained with reference to FIG. 13. FIG. 13 is a diagram showing the use, in a liquid crystal display, of a heat seal connector as an 
electrical connector means for making an electrical connection with an external circuit. FIG. 13(a) is a top plan view when looking from the front side of the display of the liquid 
crystal display. FIG. 13(b) is a cross-sectional view taken from the A-A line of FIG. 13(a). FIG. 
13(c) is a cross-sectional view of the requisite portions of FIG. 13(b). In these figures, an upper 
polarizer 9 and a lower polarizer with reflector plate 10 are generally equal to or are greater 
than the possible display range 12 of the liquid crystal display. Consequently, upper polarizer 9 
and lower polarizer with reflector plate 10 are nearly of the same size as the smaller sized 
substrate of the pair of upper substrate 1 and lower substrate 2 (upper substrate 1 in the case 
of FIG. 13) and arranged in nearly the same position. This point is already known in the art. For 
example, see JP-A- 3-96921 (1991). However, because of an electrode terminal 7 being formed on lower substrate 2 of the 
conventional liquid crystal display which is constructed of a pair of flexible plastic films (for 
example, thickness of approximately 100 µm), when external forces arise during the 
manufacturing process or when the display is incorporated into an electronic device, electrode 
terminal 7 can easily bend, cracks can appear in the transparent electrode of electrode terminal 
7, and disconnections or wire breakage occur. Also, if the exposed transparent electrode of 
electrode terminal 7 is touched, flaws can occur in the transparent electrode resulting in 
disconnections. Further, in the case when pressure is exerted on electrode terminal 7 during 
the incorporation into an electronic device, cracks and disconnections may occur when the 
edge of upper substrate 1, which faces lower substrate 2, where electrode terminal 7 is 
formed, is forced against the transparent electrode of electrode terminal 7. Consequently, a 
liquid crystal display using flexible substrates such as plastic films must be handled extremely 
carefully. In view of this, large problems are caused in the production process such as an 
increased number of
