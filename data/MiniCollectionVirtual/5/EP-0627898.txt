<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a piezoelectric vibrator (2) adapted to generate ultrasonic energy which is transmitted through an output section (4) to a plastics head (6). The shape of the head (6) may be varied to suit whichever part of a body (8) on which it is to be used. The material and shape of the head (6) is chosen to allow accurate control of frequency and amplitude of the ultrasonic energy. The preferred ultrasonic frequency is in the range of 20-120 kHz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic therapeutic treatment device. The application of ultrasound in diagnostic scanning techniques and therapeutic treatment of 
specific medical conditions has been widely reported in technical literature over the last 20-30 
years. However, we have found no relevant reference to the use of frequencies in the range 
30-100 kHz. The reported applications of therapeutic ultrasound relate almost exclusively 
to use of frequencies in the MHz band. One example of this is shown in US-A-3847141 
which discloses an ultrasonic bone densitometer using a frequency in the MHz band. Also 
EP-A-324711 discloses use of energy at 1.5 MHz for healing bone fractures. US-A-4989613 
on which the preamble of Claim 1 is based 
discloses another apparatus for confirming suspected bone fractures using intrasonic energy at a frequency 
below 20 kHz. This use of MHz frequencies stems from the concept that therapeutic treatment using 
ultrasonic energy should be directed accurately to a well defined region of tissue and that this 
is best achieved with a finely focused beam which in turn dictates the use of high frequencies. 
Similar arguments apply to the selection of frequencies for ultrasonic imaging applications. 
For example the characteristic wavelength corresponding to a 3 MHz transmission through 
soft tissue is about 0.5mm; but at 40 kHz the wavelength would be approximately 37.5mm. Furthermore, it is known that the attenuation of ultrasonic waves increases with increasing 
frequency. The general effect of high frequency transmission is to produce relatively high 
energy absorption rates close to the entry surface and for the effect to fall off with increasing 
depth. It might therefore be concluded that for a given power input there is a greater 
likelihood of potentially harmful side effects in tissue near the surface than for a 
corresponding low frequency input. When treating deep tissue injuries this consideration 
becomes very important since in order to transmit enough energy to the required region, the 
risk of excessive absorption in the surface layers may become unreasonably high when 
applying therapeutic ultrasound in the MHz band. For this reason energy levels are limited  
 
by the requirement that power input should not exceed 3 watts/cm2. By selecting an operating frequency band in the range 30-130 kHz a good wave penetration 
through deep muscle tissue is ensured and frequencies which are known to result in high 
attenuation in bone tissue are avoided.
