<ABSTRACT>
An agitator for mixing or blending various products, in 
particular paints, varnishes or the like, disposed in a 

container (C), has a fixed support structure (20) which is 
resiliently connected to a first framework (11) which in 

turn supports a second framework (5) in a generally 
oscillatory manner. An upper plate (6) and a lower plate 

(2), rotatable about a vertical axis and mounted on the 
second framework, hold the container (C). When the machine 

is in use, an electric motor (14), mounted on the first 
framework (11), rotates a shaft (16) provided with pins (18) 

which are eccentric relative to the axis of rotation of the 
shaft (16) and are connected to the second framework (5). 

The actuation of the motor (14) gives rise to an orbital 
oscillatory motion of both frameworks (5, 11) together and 

the intermittent and unidirectional rotation of the lower 
plate (2) about a substantially vertical axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agitator for mixing 
or blending various products. In particular, the present invention has been developed 
with respect to agitators for mixing or blending paints, 
varnishes or the like, generally placed in containers 
preferably having a substantially cylindrical shape, of the 
type comprising: 
a general support structure; a first framework resiliently connected to the support 
structure;  a second framework which is associated with the first 
framework with a general capacity for relative oscillation; holding means associated with the second framework for 
clamping therebetween at least one of the containers containing the 
products to be mixed; operating means which are further provided for driving an 
orbital - oscillatory movement of the second framework 
relative to a reference axis which is fixed relative to the 
first framework (see e.g. GB-A-2 192 138, DE-A-2 819 833). In the current practice for producing a range of paints 
having, for example, a series of different colour shades, a 
base paint, generally a white paint, is usually mixed with 
one or more coloured pigments which are added in proportions 
such that the desired colour shade is ensured overall when 
they have been mixed and homogenized with the base paint. When paints are prepared according to the above mixing 
methods, it is increasingly necessary to produce different 
quantities from time to time depending on the demands and 
immediate needs of the users. In particular, a range of 
preferred amounts although not limiting, in the preparation  
 
of the paints and their mixtures can vary from small 
fractions of a litre to approximately 30 - 40 litres. The conventional mixing methods provide for different 
types of methods and agitators depending on the overall 
quantity of components to be mixed and their physical and 
chemical properties. For large amounts of relatively fluid 
paints, a machine of the type comprising a mechanical 
stirrer which is immersed in the paint is generally used 
and, for example, blends the components with a rotary 
motion. These machines are generally used only in large 
plants producing large amounts of paints since they do not 
allow the colour shade to be changed quickly without the 
entire stirrer being replaced, an operation which is 
generally complicated and expensive, especially for small 
amounts of paint in a broad spectrum of colours. For viscous, heavy and dense products and for medium-large 
amounts, apparatus with a gyroscopic effect are used 
in

An agitator for mixing or blending various products, in 
particular paints, or varnishes, placed 

in containers (C), comprising: 

a general support structure (20); 
a first framework (11) resiliently connected to the 
support structure (20); 
a second framework (5) which is associated with the first 
framework (11) with a capacity for relative 

oscillation;

provided for driving an orbital - oscillatory movement of 

the second framework (5) relative to a reference axis (X - 
X) which is fixed relative to the first framework (11), 
 
characterized in that the holding means (2, 6) comprise a 

drive unit (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30) acting on the 
holding means to impart to the 

container (C) a general rotational movement about a second 
axis, different from and non-parallel to the reference 

axis (X - X) which is 
superimposed on the orbital - oscillatory movement. 
An agitator according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the holding means (2, 6) comprise a first plate element (2) 

rotatably mounted on the first framework (5), comprising 
toothed transmission means (25) coupled to a pinion element 

(27) which is driven into rotation for imparting to the 
first plate element (2) said rotational movement 

about said second axis. 
An agitator according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
said first plate element (2) comprises at least one 

substantially cylindrical peripheral portion which is  
 

associated with a toothed rim (25) coupled to said pinion 
element (27), a ratchet unit (28) which can be activated by 

means of a driving bar (29) articulated to the support 
structure (20) driving the pinion (27) and hence the first 

plate element (2) in intermittent and unidirectional 
rotation.

said pinion element (27) is coupled to an auxiliary electric 

motor which is controlled to drive the pinion element (27)

second plate elements (2, 6) cooperating, in use, for 

clamping at least one container (C).

second idle plate element (6) is disposed above the first plate 

element (2), guide means being provided for extracting at least 
partially the second plate element from the support

it comprises at least one motor (14) associated with a shaft 

(16) rotatably supported by the second framework (11), the 
first framework (5) being coupled eccentrically to the shaft
