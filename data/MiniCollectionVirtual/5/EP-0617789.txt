<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for taking a representative milk sample during the transfer of an amount of milk supplied by a supplier from a container (1) into a collecting container (10). In order to obtain a representative sample even in the case of foaming milk, for example, the pump (5) of a sampling device (4) for taking a representative milk sample is operated as a function of the momentary real volume of the amount of milk pumped. The real volume is detected by sensors (17, 18) capable of detecting the speed and the filling level in the suction line (3) of the quantity of milk sucked in.

Process for taking a representative milk sample during 
the delivery of a milk charge of a supplier from a tank 

via a delivery line into a collecting tank, in which 
the supplier data and desired milk charge data as well 

as continuously detected data concerning the delivery 
rate and the filling of said delivery line are inputted 

into a data acquisition means and said data are 
supplied to a control means, which controls a sampling 

means for taking said representative milk sample by 
means of a pump, in particular a peristaltic pump, out 

of said delivery line, while taking into account said 
data and stored parameters,
characterized
 in that 

control of said pump of said sampling means is 
carried out as a function of the momentary actual 

volume of the delivered milk quantity, 
the actual volume is determined by means of said data 
concerning said delivery rate continuously detected in 

the intake portion of said delivery line and by means 
of said continuously detected data concerning said 

degree of filling of said delivery line, 
said delivery rate and said degree of filling are each 
detected by means of plane sensing organs, and 
in that sampling takes place in the vicinity of the 
delivery line bottom, however, spaced from the latter. 
Process according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that
 
a calibration of the detected milk quantity volume 

takes place at a predetermined moment during removal 
when said line is completely filled. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that 

the filling level is additionally detected, 
the detection of said delivery rate, said degree of 
filling and said filling level takes place at a 

measuring place positioned upstream to the sampling 
place, and 
in that in the controlling of said pump of said 
sampling means the distance between said sampling and 

measuring place is taken into consideration as a 
retardation constant, which is appropriately derived 

from the flow rate. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized
 in that
 
said pump of said sampling means is operated with a 

predetermined output during the period of time from the 
beginning of said milk charge delivery till the 

detection of the first actual-volume value of the 
delivered milk quantity. 
Device for taking a representative milk sample during 
the delivery of a milk charge of a supplier from a tank 

(1) via a delivery line (3) into a collecting tank, with 
a sensor (17) for detecting the milk delivery rate and 

a sensor (18) for detecting the conductivity of the 
milk charge, with a data acquisition means (15) for the 

desired milk charge data and for inputting at least 
actual data of said supplier as well as for continuously 

detected data concerning said delivery rate and with a 
control means (13) connected to the data acquisition  

 
means (15) for controlling a sampling means (4) provided 

with a pump (5), in particular a peristaltic pump, 
for taking said representative milk sample as a function 

of said detected data, in particular for performing 
the process according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized
 in that 

said conductivity sensor (18) arranged in the intake 
portion of said delivery line (3), in addition to said 

sensor (17) for detecting said milk delivery rate, is 
provided for detecting said degree of filling, 
said sensors (17, 18) have plane sensing organs (25, 
26), 
said data acquisition means (15) is designed to 
detect the actual volume of the delivered amount of milk 

from said continuously detected data about said delivery 
rate and said degree of filling and to supply it to said 

control means (13) for the control of said pump (5, 6) 
of said sampling means (4), and 
in that said sampling means (4) has a removal means, the 
opening of which is arranged closely above the bottom of 

said delivery line (3). 
Device according to claim 5,
characterized
 in that 

said sensors (17, 18) for detecting said delivery rate 
and said degree of filling are mechanic-free sensors 

respectively sensors without movable sensing organs, 
and/or

organs (25, 26) in a roughly rectangular interior 

chamber (27, 28). 
Device according to claims 5 or 6,
characterized
 in that 

the sensor for detecting said delivery rate (37) and  
 

the sensor for detecting said degree of filling (38) are 
arranged in a common casing (30), and
