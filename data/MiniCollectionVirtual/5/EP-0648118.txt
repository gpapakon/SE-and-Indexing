<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to treatment for increasing the accommodative ability of the eye, for the purpose of decreasing the severity of clinically evident presbyopia, an age-related loss of accommodative ability. The compounds and methods of the invention act by decreasing the tone of parts of the ciliary muscle which act to decrease accommodation, thereby increasing the contractile force of the remaining ciliary muscle, with resultant increased accommodative function.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ETHODS AND PRODUCTS FOR TREATING PRESBYOPIABackground of the InventionPresbyopia, or age-related loss of accommodative ability, is a very common ocular pathology. Accommodative ability refers to the capacity of the eye to focus for near vision by changing the shape of the lens to become more convex. The ocular tissues involved in the accommodative response include the lens, the zonules (suspensory ligaments) of the lens, and the ciliary muscle. These structures function together in accommodating the eye for focusing on close objects.Within the eye, the lens is centrally suspended between the anterior and posterior chambers, behind the pupillary opening of the iris. The lens is supported by a radially oriented array of zonules which extend from the lateral edges of the lens to the inner border of the circumferential ciliary muscle. The ciliary muscle is attached to the scleral coat of the eye.At rest, the eye is focused for distant vision with the lens held in a somewhat flattened, or slightly convex, shape by tension exerted on its periphery by the zonules. These ligaments pull the edges of the lens towards the ciliary body. During accommodation, the shape of the lens becomes more convex. This action is achieved through contraction of the ciliary muscle which allows the ciliary attachment of the zonules to move inward towards the lens, thereby reducing the tension in the zonules. This reduction in tension allows the lens to increase in convexity, resulting in an increase in dioptric power which enables near objects to be imaged clearly on the retina.Loss of accommodative ability can be measured as the progressive regression of the near point of accommodation, which is the closest point for which the eye can accommodate so that a clear image is formed on the retina. The near 

point of accommodation is nearest to the eye in the young and recedes gradually until about the age of 45 years, when a much more rapid recession of the near point ensues. This recession continues unabated until about the age of 60 years, by which time all accommodation has been lost.The amplitude of accommodation may also be quantified by measuring the dioptric power of the eye, a measure of refractive power. The dioptric power is measured in diopters (D) . Acco odative ability is greatest in childhood and slowly decreases until it is lost in middle age. At the age of 8 years the dioptric power of the eye can be raised by accommodation to approximately 14 D; at the age of 20 years this has fallen to 11 D. At the age of 30 years

 CLAIMS
1. A method for increasing the accomodative ability of a presbyopic subject, comprising administering to the subject a beta-adrenergic antagonist in an amount sufficient to increase the accomodative ability of the subject by at least 0.5 diopters.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the beta-adrenergic antagonist is administered topically to the eye in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic preparation.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the beta-adrenergic antagonist is administered to a subject that is otherwise free of indications for ophthalmic beta-adrenergic antagonist treatment.
4. The method of claim 2 wherein the beta-adrenergic antagonist is administered to a subject that is free of elevated intraocular pressure.
5. The method of claim 3 wherein the beta-adrenergic antagonist is selected and is administered in an amount whereby the treatment is free of clinically significant adverse effects on the visualization of distance objects.
