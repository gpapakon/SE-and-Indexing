<ABSTRACT>
The partition wall (2) is introduced into the tubular wall (1) via an open end thereof, in order to bring it into the position which it is to occupy, and the partition wall is then deformed by means of punches (8,9) comprising annular ribs (10) and applied against the two faces (6,7) of the partition wall, radially expanding the latter so as to immobilise it in the said position by clamping in the tubular wall. Application to condensers for air-conditioning of motor vehicles.

A method of making a heat exchanger comprising at 
least one fluid header with a tubular wall, divided 

into compartments (3, 4) by a transverse partition (2) 
substantially in the form of a disc, together with a 

multiplicity of parallel tubes each of which 
communicates with a compartment of the fluid header 

through an aperture in the said tubular wall (1), in 
which method the partition is introduced into the 

tubular wall through an open end of the latter, so as 
to bring it into the position which it is to occupy, 

characterised in that the partition is subsequently 
deformed by means of tools (8, 9) which are applied 

against both faces (6, 7) of the latter, so as to 
expand it radially in such a way as to immobilise it in 

the said position in which it is gripped in the tubular 
wall. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one of the said tools is a punch (8, 9) 

having a projecting region (10) which forms a hollow 
recess (14) in the corresponding face of the partition 

(2). 
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the said projecting region (10) is bounded on its  

 
radially outer side by a first annular surface (11) 

which surrounds the longitudinal axis (5) of the 
tubular wall (1) and is inclined with respect to the 

latter. 
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the projecting region (10) is bounded on its 

radially inner side by a second annular surface (12) 
which is inclined with respect to the said axis (5) in 

the direction opposite to the first annular surface 
(11), and which defines with the latter an annular 

incising edge (13). 
A method according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the first annular surface (11) is inclined more 

steeply than the second annular surface (12). 
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that punches (8, 9) having projecting 

regions (10) which are disposed substantially in facing 
relationship with each other, are applied on the two 

faces (6, 7) of the partition (2). 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the tools (8, 9) are applied by 

percussion on the faces (6, 7) of the partition (2). 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the tubular wall (1) is brazed to  

 
the partition (2) and/or to the tubes, so as to provide 

a seal against fluid. 
A method according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the brazing operation is carried out by melting a 

fusible metallic coating which is provided on at least 
one of the components to be brazed.
