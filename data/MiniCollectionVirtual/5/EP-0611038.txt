<ABSTRACT>
A cable tie (10) having a tongue (12) with ratchet teeth (22. 24) on opposite 
broad sides (14. 16) of the tongue and two stationary teeth (42) on an 

abutment surface (30) opposite a hinged pawl (28) within a locking head opening 
(26) is injection molded by combining a first mold part (50) defining a portion 

of a mold cavity (54) that forms a first set of ratchet teeth (22) on the one 
broad side (14) of the tongue and a second mold part (52) that defines a portion 

of the mold cavity that forms a second set of ratchet teeth (24) on the other 
broad side (16) of the tongue. The second mold part includes a core (56) that 

defines at least a portion of the mold cavity that forms the opening in the locking 
head (18); and the first mold part is combined with the core of the second 

mold part at an interior parting surface (58) that is remote from the portion (60) 
of the mold cavity that forms the apexes (46) of the stationary teeth. The 

solidified tie is ejected from the opened mold without separating the mold parts 
at any portion of the mold cavity that forms an apex of the stationary teeth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to injection molding a tie that
is useful for forming a loop for retaining a bundle of elongated articles, such as
cables, and is particularly directed to injection molding a particular design of
such a tie. According to such particular design. the tie includes an elongated
tongue with two ends and two broad sides, a locking head at one end of the
tongue, a tip at the other end of the tongue, a first set of ratchet teeth extending
along one broad side of the tongue and a second set of ratchet teeth extending
along the other broad side of the tongue; wherein the locking head has sides
defining an opening for receiving the tip of the tongue to form said loop, including
a movable pawl that is hinged at one side of said opening and with an abutment
surface on the opposite side of said opening from the pawl; wherein the
pawl has at least one pawl tooth disposed for engaging the first set of ratchet
teeth when the tip of the tongue has been inserted through said opening with
the second set of ratchet teeth facing the abutment surface, wherein the pawl.
when the at least one pawl tooth is so engaged, is movable toward the abutment
surface in response to pressure applied to the tongue in a direction opposite to
the direction of said insertion in order to force the second set of ratchet teeth
against the abutment surface; and at least one stationary tooth disposed on the
abutment surface and having an apex for engaging the second set of ratchet
teeth when the second set of ratchet teeth is forced against the abutment surface
to thereby in combination with the at least one pawl tooth hold the tongue
in the locking head when pressure is applied to the tongue in the direction opposite
to the direction of said insertion. This particular design of tie is preferred
because the combined engagement of ratchet teeth on both sides of the tongue
enhances the retaining function of the tie. Such a tie is described in United
States Patents Nos. 4,473,524 to Paradis and 5,146,654 to Caveney et al.Heretofore. it has not been considered practical to injection mold such
a tie because it has been thought that such a tie could not be ejected from a 
mold following solidification of the tie without damage to the at
least one stationary tooth unless the mold parts were separated at
the portion of the mold cavity defining the apex of the at least one
stationary tooth.The present invention provides a method of injection molding a
tie that is useful for forming a loop for retaining a bundle of

<CLAIMS>
A method of injection molding a tie (10) that is useful for forming a loop for
retaining a bundle of elongated articles, the tie comprising an elongated tongue (12) with

two ends and two broad sides (14, 16), a locking head (18) at one end of the tongue, a tip
(20) at the other end of the tongue, a first set of ratchet teeth (22) extending along one

broad side of the tongue and a second set of ratchet teeth (24) extending along the other
broad side of the tongue, wherein the locking head has sides defining an opening (26) for

receiving the tip of the tongue, the sides including a movable pawl (28) that is hinged at
one side of said opening and an abutment surface (30) that is on the other side of the

opening from the pawl, wherein the pawl has at least one pawl tooth (32, 34) disposed for
engaging the set of first ratchet teeth when the tip of the tongue has been inserted through

said opening with the second set of ratchet teeth facing the abutment surface, wherein the
pawl, when the at least one pawl tooth is so engaged, is movable toward the abutment

surface in response to pressure applied to the tongue in a direction opposite to the
direction of said insertion (40) in order to force the second set of ratchet teeth against the

abutment surface, and wherein at least one stationary tooth (42) is disposed on the
abutment surface (30) and has an apex (46) for engaging the second set of ratchet teeth

(2) when the second set of ratchet teeth is forced against the abutment surface to thereby
in combination with the at least one pawl tooth (32, 34) hold the tongue in the locking

head (18) when pressure is applied to the tongue (12) in the direction opposite to the
direction of said insertion (40), the method comprising the steps of


(a) providing a mold by combining a first mold part (50) defining a portion of a
mold cavity (54) that forms the first set of ratchet teeth (22) on the one broad side of the

tongue (12) with a second mold part (52) that defines a portion of the mold cavity that 
forms the second set of ratchet teeth (24) on the other broad side of the tongue, wherein

the second mold part includes a core (56) that defines at least a portion of the mold cavity
that forms the opening (26) in the locking head (18);
(b) injecting molding material into the mold cavity to form the tie;
(c) solidifying the injected molding material to solidify the tie;
(d) opening the mold by separating the first mold part from the second mold parts;
and
(e) ejecting the solidified tie from the opened mold;

   characterised in that step (a) comprises combining the first mold part with the core
of the second mold part at an interior parting surface (58) that is remote from the portion

(60) of the mold cavity that forms the apex (46) of the at least one stationary tooth (42);
step (d) comprises separating the first mold part from the second mold part at the
interior parting surface (58); and
step (e) comprises ejecting the solidified tie from the opened mold without the
mold being opened at the portion (60) of the mold cavity that forms the apex (46) of the at

least one stationary tooth (42).
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that step (a) further comprises
combining the first mold part (50) with the second mold part (52) at a said interior parting

surface (58) that lies in approximately a single plane and at an exterior parting surface (62)
that circumscribes the mold cavity and is approximately coplanar with the interior parting

surface. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein at least two said stationary teeth
(42) respectively having apexes (46) are disposed on the abutment surface (30) for

engaging different teeth of the second set of ratchet teeth when the second set of ratchet
teeth is so forced against the abutment surface,

   characterised in that step (a) comprises combining the first mold part with the core
of the second mold part at an interior parting surface (58) that is remote from the apexes

of the at least two stationary teeth; and

   step (e) comprises ejecting the solidified tie from the opened mold without the
mold being opened at at least one portion (60) of the mold cavity that forms the apex (46)

of one of the at least two stationary teeth.
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the paw] has at least two teeth

(32, 34) disposed for engaging different teeth of the first set of ratchet teeth (22) when the
tip (20) of the tongue (12) is so inserted through said opening (26).
