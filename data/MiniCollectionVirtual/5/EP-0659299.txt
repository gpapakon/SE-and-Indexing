<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to electrochemical 
cells and, more particularly, to electrochemical cells utilizing a polymer 
electrolyte. In recent years, workers in the battery art have begun to 
appreciate the advantages of solid-state cells; particularly cells having a 
lithium anode, a cathode, and a polymer electrolyte have become known. 
The advantages of those cells include less weight than conventional 
batteries using a liquid electrolyte, long service life, relatively high 
energy densities, and relatively high specific energies. The present invention generally provides an electrochemical 
cell having a polymer electrolyte that can be assembled relatively simply 
into a stack having desired power characteristics such as high energy 
density in terms of Watt-hours per kilogram and Watt-hours per liter. 
More particularly, the present invention provides a fan-folded 
electrochemical cell stack having a plurality of discrete electrode segments 
that are easily adapted to contact one another. In one of its embodiments, the electrochemical cell stack of 
the present invention includes a continuous laminate web having a 
continuous electrode layer, a continuous electrolyte layer, and a plurality  
 
of discrete opposite polarity electrode segments secured on top of the 
electrolyte layer in predetermined locations. The continuous laminate 
web is fan-folded at predetermined fold positions such that the opposite 
polarity electrode segments contact an electrolyte layer on the top and 
bottom sides of each of the opposite polarity electrode segments. The 
fan-folded continuous laminate web forms a stack having first and second 
sides. Opposite polarity electrode current collector means for collecting 
opposite polarity electrode current are provided, and electrode current 
collector means for collecting electrode current are provided. Preferably, 
the web is fan-folded at the fold positions such that every other fold 
position on the first side of the fan-folded continuous laminate web 
extends past a preceding and a succeeding fold position on the first side of 
the stack a predetermined extended length. The present invention can be further understood with 
reference to the following description in conjunction with the appended 
drawings, wherein like elements are provided with the same reference 
numerals. In the drawings: 
Figure 1 is a schematic exploded, perspective view of a 
laminate for forming an electrochemical cell stack according to an 
embodiment of the present invention;
