<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR DYEING HYDROPHOBIC POLYMER PRODUCTSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to processes and compositions for dyeing hydrophobic polymer fibers such as polyester, polyester blends, nylon, nylon blends and polyester/nylon blends.BACKGROUND ARTThe typical polyester dye is a disperse dye. Conventionally, polyester and polyester blend disperse dye carrier levelers consist of a fiber swelling solvent and an emulsifier package. The emulsifier package, which contains one or more emulsifiers stabilizes the final carrier/leveler product and allows the solvent to be dispersed evenly in water.Disperse dyeing processes are typically used to dye products (goods) including carpet, flatgoods, yarns and finished goods made at least in part of hydrophobic polymer filaments or fibers including polyester, nylon, polyacrylonitrile and polyurethane (E. R. Trotman (ed.) "Dyeing and Chemical Technology of Textile Fibers," Sixth Ed., Charles Griffin and Co. Ltd., High Wycomb, 1984).The typical disperse dyeing systems used in the art include water- based processes. Water provides a medium in which to disperse the solvent and dye to facilitate contact of the dye with all areas of the goods being dyed in order to produce level dyeing of the goods. In addtion, the water-based processes permit utilization of nearly all of the dye in the dyeing solution.Typical disperse dyeing processes utilize a dyeing solution comprising a carrier/leveler composition (solvent and emulsifier), dyestuffs and water. The dyestuff dissolves in the solvent and the emulsifier disperses the 

solvent containing dissolved dyestuff into the water. The dye bath is then heated to temperature ranging from about 180°F to about 212°F. The goods to be dyed are put in contact with the dye bath by various standard means.Although not thoroughly understood, the general principle by which hydrophobic polymer fibers and filaments and various blends of those fibers are dyed is by the use of a carrier/leveler composition containing a solvent for the dyestuff that swells the polyester fiber, thus, opening the molecular pattern of the fiber to enlarge the interstitial spaces and allowing the dye to "move into" the fiber and dye the fiber. It has been known that solvents, such as aromatic and halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons and phenols, accelerate the adsorption and absorption of disperse dyes into the fiber. Thus, the solvent portion of the dyeing solution is called a carrier.Solvents in which the typically hydrophobic disperse dyes are
