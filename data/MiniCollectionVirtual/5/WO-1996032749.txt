<ABSTRACT>
An IGBT having a high withstand voltage, small power consumption and small device formation area. An n
<
--
>
 type semiconductor layer (38) is provided at a portion which is likely to cause surface breakdown, and an n
<
-
>
 type semiconductor layer (36) is disposed below the former. Therefore, the theoretical withstand voltage in the n
<
--
>
 type semiconductor layer (38) is higher than the theoretical withstand voltage in the n
<
-
>
 type semiconductor layer (36), and the surface breakdown voltage can be correspondingly increased. Since the n
<
-
>
 type semiconductor layer (36) having a lower resistance is disposed below the n
<
--
>
 type semiconductor layer (38), the region which affects power consumption of the IGBT has a lower resistance, and power consumption becomes smaller.
