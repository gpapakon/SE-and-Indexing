<ABSTRACT>
Documents before and after scanning are handled by 
providing a document container (10) having: a bottom (14), two side 

walls (16,18), and one end wall (20); 
a lid (22) hinged to the body near the one 

end wall, the lid defining a top and an opposite end wall; the 
bottom having a cutout (34) opposite the one end wall to facilitate 

manually removing a stack of documents from the container when 
the lid is open; and a latch for releasable holding the lid 

closed against the body. The document container is supported 
at an angle with its lid open and the one end wall at the top 

on a container support having a pair of tabs for aligning a 
bottom edge of documents placed in the container and limiting 

the height of a stack of documents placed in the container. A 
stack of documents is loaded in the document container and the 

container is closed and latched. The container is then 
transported with the aligned edge of the documents down to a 

document scanner input station. The documents are removed from 
the container and the stack of documents is placed in the 

scanner input station with the aligned edge toward a set of 
feed rollers. A document receiving container is provided at an 

output station of the document scanner for receiving scanned 
documents in the order of scanning. After the documents are 

scanned, the document receiving container is removed from the 
output station and stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to document handling 
apparatus and methods, and more particularly to apparatus 
for securely handling documents that are being scanned in a 
scanner. In some document scanning operations a large 
number of loose documents are scanned to record the 
documents electronically, and then the original documents 
are stored. It is often imperative that the original 
documents are maintained in their original order. For 
example in a program to handle documentation for the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service, all US tax returns and associated 
documents will be processed, scanned and stored within IRS 
Service Centers. Individual taxpayer submissions are 
prepared for scanning by removing all paper fasteners, such 
as staples, paper clips, rubber bands, etc., at a document 
preparation area and are moved to the scanner for scanning. 
The documents must be moved to the scanner in such a manner 
that they are not lost, reshuffled or dropped. The documents to be scanned are often of various 
sizes, thicknesses and states of disrepair. Many document 
scanners, such as the Kodak IMAGELINK Scanner 900 or 923, 
feed documents from a stack of documents that are aligned 
along a common edge. In the document handling process prior 
to scanning it is therefore required to establish a "common 
edge" for the documents to be grasped by the front feed 
rollers of the scanner's paper transport mechanism. In 
addition, for the IMAGELINK 900 and 923 Scanners, only a  
 
stack of documents whose height does not exceed 1.5 inches 
(3.75 cm) can be reliably fed in the scanner. After the documents are scanned, it is necessary 
that all of the documents are collected and retrieved from 
the scanner in the order in which they were scanned, and 
moved to a document storage area. No documents can be 
misplaced or lost during the movement from the scanner to 
the document storage area. The existing output tray of the 
Kodak IMAGELINK Scanner 900/923 does not offer the degree of 
document security that is desirable in an operation such as 
(income tax file scanning). The documents can get out of 
sequence and smaller sized documents can fall out of the 
tray and become misplaced. In addition, to conserve 
valuable storage space, it is desirable that the means of 
storing the documents not take up unnecessary storage space. The present invention is directed to overcoming 
one or more of the problems set forth above. Briefly 
summarized, according to one aspect of the present 
invention, documents to be scanned are

<CLAIMS>
A method of handling documents before and after 
scanning, comprising the steps of: 


a. providing a document container having: a bottom, two 
side walls, and one end wall; a lid hinged to the body near 

said one end wall, said lid defining a top and an opposite end 
wall; said bottom having a cutout opposite said one end wall to 

facilitate manually removing a stack of documents from said 
container when said lid is open; and latch means for releasable 

holding said lid closed against said body; 
b. supporting said container at an angle with its lid 
open and said one end wall at the top on a container support 

having alignment means for aligning a bottom edge of documents 
placed in said container and stack height limiting means for 

limiting the height of a stack of documents placed in said 
container; 
c. loading a stack of documents in said container; 
d. closing and latching said container and transporting 
said container with the aligned edge of said documents pointing 

down to a document scanner input station; 
e. removing the stack of documents from the container 
and placing the stack of documents in the scanner input station 

with the aligned edge toward a set of feed rollers in said 
input station 
f. providing a document receiving container at an output 
station of said document scanner for receiving scanned 

documents in the order of scanning; 
g. scanning said stack of documents; and 
h. removing said document receiving container containing 
said scanned documents in the order of scanning from said 

output station and storing said document receiving container 
with said scanned documents. 
The method claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
document receiving container is a document container as defined 

in step a. 
The method claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
document receiving container is an expandable folder and said 

document scanner is provided with a fixture at the output 
station for holding said expandable folder open to receive 

scanned documents. 
A document container, comprising: 

a. a body having a bottom, two side walls, and one end 
wall; 
b. a lid hinged to the body near said one end wall, 
said lid defining a top and an opposite end wall; 
c. said bottom having a cutout opposite said one end 
wall to facilitate manually removing a stack of documents from 

said document container when said lid is open; and 
d. latch means for releasable holding said lid closed

holding said lid closed against said body; and 
b. document container support means for supporting said 
document container at an angle with its lid open for receiving 

documents, said document container support means including 
means for aligning the bottom edges of documents placed in said 

document container and for controlling a maximum height for a 

stack of documents in said document container. 
Apparatus for holding an expandable folder open 
at a document exit station of a document scanner, comprising: a

spaced apart by the width of said expandable folder by a cross 
member, said wedge shaped side members having a length
