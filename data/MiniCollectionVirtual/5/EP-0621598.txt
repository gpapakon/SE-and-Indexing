<ABSTRACT>
A memory control device having a memory (13) for reading out and holding managing data from a 
recording medium (1) is equipped with a memory controller (12) for outputting write-in/read-out addresses 

through an address generating circuit and receiving write-in/read-out data, and a system controller (11) for 
controlling the memory controller (12) to execute the data write-in/read-out operation on the memory. When link 

data in the managing information is supplied from the system controller (11) or obtained from the data read in 
from the memory (1
3), an address to be next accessed on the basis of the link data is calculated and the calculated 
address is output to the memory (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a memory control device for use in a recording and/or reproducing apparatus
capable of recording and/or reproducing data organized in programs (such as audio data, musical pieces, etc.),
on a disc-type recording medium for example. This invention further relates to an address generating circuit
provided in the memory control device.There have been known data re-writable disc media on which a user can record programs (such as
musical pieces, etc.). These disc media are provided with a data area (user TOC, hereinafter referred to
"U-TOC") for managing areas on which the programs have been already recorded, and for managing
recordable areas. These media are designed so that managing data for these areas is re-written every time a
recording operation, an erasing operation or an overwriting operation for the programs is performed.For instance, an audio recording device is designed so that in an audio recording operation for a
program, a recordable area on a disc is located on the basis of the U-TOC. The device then records the
program for the audio data on this recordable area. On the other hand, for a reproducing device, the U-TOC
data is used to locate an area on which a program to be reproduced is recorded. The device then accesses the
area to carry out a reproducing operation for the program.In such disc media, the area management on the disc and the position management of the U-TOC are
carried out on the basis of a pre-mastered TOC (hereinafter referred to as "P-TOC"). The P-TOC comprises
managing information formed as pit data.One known type of disc media is a pre-mastered disc medium in which programs (such as musical
pieces, etc.) are recorded as pit information. This type of disk medium is exclusively used for reproduction.
The rewriting of the managing information is not required for this pre-mastered type of disk, and the area
management of the programs is carried out solely on the basis of the P-TOC.Generally, for a recordable disc medium, such as a magneto-optical disc (MO disc) or the like, random
access can be more easily carried out as compared to a tape recording medium formed as a tape, such as a
compact cassette tape or the like. Furthermore, when recording on a disc medium it is not generally necessary
to record a program (such as a musical piece) on a continuous segment. Note that in this specification, the
term "segment" is defined as a track portion on which physically-continuous data is recorded. That is, no
problem would occur if the program is divided and
