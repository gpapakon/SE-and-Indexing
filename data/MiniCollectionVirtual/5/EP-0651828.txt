<CLAIMS>
The use of Guerbet alcohols for preventing fatty 
spew on leather, characterized in that one or more 

Guerbet alcohols with a pour point below 6°C which 
correspond to general formula (I): 


R¹-CH (CH₂OH) -R²
 
in which R¹ and R² independently of one another represent 

an alkyl group containing 6 to 12 carbon atoms, with the 
proviso that the total number of carbon atoms per alcohol 

molecule is in the range from 16 to 24,
 
are used in the oiling of leather. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the Guerbet alcohols have a pour point below -10°C. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 2-hexyldecan-1-ol and/or 2-octyldodecan-1-ol is/are 
used as the Guerbet alcohols. 
Fatty spew inhibiting compositions containing an 
oiling component and a fatty spew inhibiting additive, 
characterized in that
 the additive comprises one or more 
Guerbet alcohols with a pour point below 6°C which 

correspond to general formula (I): 

R¹-CH(CH₂OH)-R²
 
in which R¹ and R² independently of one another represent 

an alkyl group containing 6 to 12 carbon atoms, with the 
proviso that the total number of carbon atoms per alcohol 

molecule is in the range from 16 to 24. 
A composition as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized 
in that
 the oiling component is a neutral fat. 
A process for oiling leather in which tanned leather 
is treated with an oiling component and a fatty spew 

inhibiting additive, 
characterized in that
 one or more  
 

Guerbet alcohols with a pour point below 6°C which 
correspond to general formula (I): 


R¹-CH(CH₂OH)-R²
 
in which R¹ and R² independently of one another represent 

an alkyl group containing 6 to 12 carbon atoms, with the 
provi
so that the total number of carbon atoms per alcohol 
molecule is in the range from 16 to 24,
 
is/are used as the additive. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in 
that
 a neutral fat is predominantly used as the oiling 
component. 
A process as claimed in claim 6 or 7, 
characterized 
in that
 chrome-tanned leather is used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 6 to 8, 

characterized in that
 the Guerbet alcohols have a pour 
point below -10°C.
