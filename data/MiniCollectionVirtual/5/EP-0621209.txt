<ABSTRACT>
Hinged-lid boxes are a known and wide-spread package for cigarettes. If a gap is required within the package between the cigarettes or between other elongate articles (36), said gap is brought about by a supporting member (39) which is arranged between rows (37, 38) of the articles (36) and fix them by means of holders, e.g. holding depressions, holding tongues (46) or the like. The supporting member (39) is expediently provided with at least one upright bearing wall (45) out of which the holders, namely holding tongues (46) are formed by special stampings and foldings.

Hinge-lid pack with stick-shaped articles, such 
as cigarettes, which are arranged within the hinge-lid 

pack in a formation having at least two parallel rows 
(37, 38), with a pack part (20) and a lid (21) which is 

connected in an articulated manner to a rear wall (24) of 
the pack part (20), and with a collar (36) which is 

arranged in the pack part (20) and of which the upper 
part projecting from the pack part (20) is surrounded, in 

the closed position, by the lid (21), characterized by 
the following features: 


a) the articles (36) are held in the pack part (20) by 
a supporting member (39), in such a way that the 

articles (36) are, on all sides, at a distance from 
one another and from side walls (29, 30) of the 

hinge-lid pack, 
b) the height of the supporting member (39) is smaller 
than the height of the pack part (20), 
c) the supporting member (39) has, for each article 
(36), holders which face the articles (36), are 

adapted to the contours of the articles (36) and are 
arranged at a distance from one another, 
d) arranged in each case between adjacent rows (37, 38) 
of the articles (36) is a supporting member (39) 

having holders which are arranged at a distance from 
one another in height and which extend in a plane 

transverse relatively to the longitudinal axis of 
the articles (36), in such a way that each article 

(36) is gripped by at least two holders arranged at 
a distance one above the other. 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the supporting member (39) has at least 

one vertical carrying wall (45), on which are arranged 
holders which are designed as holding tongues (46) and 

which are formed out of the carrying wall (45) by means 
of corresponding punchings, the holders being connected 

to the carrying wall (45) via a folding line (49) and 
being folded through 90Â° about the folding line (49) into 

a horizontal position directed transverse relatively to 
the carrying wall (45). 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the articles (36) are fixed by the 

holding tongues (46) which are connected to the carrying 
wall (45) and which extend between adjacent articles (36) 

of a row (37, 38) and grip these positively on two 
mutually opposite sides by means of correspondingly 

designed depressions (47, 48). 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the holders are designed as supporting 

walls (56, 57) which extend in a plane transverse relatively 
to the longitudinal axis of the articles (36) and 

which have, at free edges, especially trough-shaped 
recesses (58) for receiving a part region of the articles 

(36). 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the two supporting walls (56, 57) are 

part of a one-piece strip-shaped blank which is folded at 
right angles and which is fastened in the pack part (20) 

at a distance from the bottom wall (23) of the latter.
