<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a device to be used in the sale of 
groceries, especially pastries or similar groceries, this device 
comprises a side, made at least in part of transparent material, 
behind which groceries can be placed, this side being fitted with 
openings through which the groceries are taken from inside the 
device. When different kinds of groceries are sold loose as, for instance 
pastries, they are usually placed on the shelves behind a 
transparent plate so that the customers can see them but the 
salespeople take the products from the shelf at the customers' 
request and wrap them up in bags or other packages. A special 
worker is needed for this job, which increases costs. Some 
products are sold as self-service so that customers take them 
from trays or other such things. Pastries and similar products 
cannot be kept in an open space facing the store for hygienic 
reasons because in an open space they would be exposed to dust, 
saliva and other forms of uncleanliness or could be damaged. The aim of the invention is to provide a device to be used in 
the sale of groceries and especially pastries, and with this device 
the disadvantages connected with present devices can be avoided. 
More precisely, the aim of the invention is to provide a 
device which is hygienic and, when it is in use, customers 
themselves can take the products they wish from the device. In 
addition, the aim of the invention is to provide a device 
which is simple in structure, reliable and easy to use and which 
saves labour costs. The aim of the invention is achieved with the device defined in 
the independent claim 1. The device according to the invention comprises a plate equipped 
with openings which has been fastened to the front of the side so  
 
that it can freely revolve, these openings have been arranged to 
turn to the front of the openings of the side when groceries are 
taken from the device. Groceries are brought to the device and 
placed, for example, in their tray onto the shelves of the device or 
against supports so that the groceries coincide with the openings 
of the side. When the device is not in use, the plate is turned in 
such a way that its openings do not coincide with the openings of 
the side. In this case, the plate covers the openings of the side and 
the groceries are behind the plate sheltered from dust, saliva and 
other uncleanliness. When a customer wishes to take some grocery 
from the device, the plate turns as a result of the customer's 
actions so that the openings of
