<ABSTRACT>
Telephone conferencing through a switch-resident 
conference bridge can be enhanced by permitting a remote 

user to initiate and control a conference using DTMF tones. 
It can be accomplished by using a DTMF receiver in 

cooperation with a delay circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone conferencing 
equipment. Specifically, the invention concerns a device 
that enables an off-premises station to control the 
conference bridge in a switch. There are several known methods for conducting a 
telephone conference. Some telephone systems permit 
conferencing by selecting feature keys or flashing the 
hook-switch. To do this, the initiator of the conference 
must be local to the telephone switch containing the 
conferencing equipment so that these signals will be 
recognized by the switch. If the user is remote, another 
person, such as the switch operator, whose hook-switch 
signals will be acknowledged, must initiate the conference. Proximity to the switch is also required because 
switches will not recognize DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency) 
tones as control signals without first receiving 
and recognizing a hook-switch flash. Moreover, even if it 
were feasible to use DTMF, any such DTMF tones would be 
transmitted to all parties in a conference at unacceptably 
loud levels. Also, other parties in the conference could 
themselves generate DTMF signals, resulting in a loss of 
control for the initiating party. Generally, only one party can be conferenced at a 
time. This requires parties that have already been 
connected to wait. Also, where some of the parties have  
 
been reached via long distance, additional toll charges 
will be incurred. Arguably, when the initiator is not local to the 
switch, for example at a hotel in a distant city, a human 
operator can set up the conference call. This of course 
requires the allocation of a person, increasing the cost 
and complexity of initiating a conference. Still, as with 
the other known methods of conferencing, only one party can 
be conferenced at a time and the initiator cannot use DTMF 
to control the conference, or any other functions provided 
by the switch. Instead of using a live operator or having the 
initiator conference in the parties, an automatic device 
could set up the call. The initiator would enter the 
telephone numbers of each of the conference participants in 
advance. Then, at a predetermined time, the equipment 
would make the necessary calls, conferencing the parties 
together. The drawbacks to such a system is the lack of 
human control, the inability to use DTMF tones as a means 
of controlling the conference, and the inability to access 
DTMF-controlled equipment. Thus, it is desirable to have 
the capability of conferencing using DTMF-controlled 
conference equipment. This and
