<ABSTRACT>
The device is used to connect a splined shaft journal (1) serving to transmit torques to a component (5) carrying an internally splined sleeve (6). The sleeve (6) has a first section (7), which serves to receive the shaft journal (1) and has axially parallel longitudinal slots (10). The outer boundary surface (9) of this section (7) has a conical taper which diverges towards the receiving side of the sleeve (6). A plurality of holes (13) is provided in one cross-sectional plane in a second section (12). Provided in this cross-sectional plane within the sleeve (6) is a closing part (14) which closes these holes (13) and can be displaced counter to a spring (15) and counter to the component (5) connected to the sleeve (6). This sleeve (6) is accommodated by a bush (18) which can be displaced relative to it and has a hole (19) which corresponds to the conical taper of the sleeve (6). Adjoining this hole there is a groove (20) which serves to accommodate detent balls (21). The second section (12) of the sleeve (6) passes through a spring (23) which is supported, at one end, on the bush (18) and, at the other end, on the component (5). Near to its end (3), the shaft journal (1) has an encircling groove.

A device for connecting a serrated shaft journal (1), used for transmitting torque, to a 
component (5) carrying an internally serrated sleeve (6), wherein the sleeve (6) comprises 

a first portion (7) used for receiving the shaft journal (1) and provided with the 
serration (8), and a plurality of bores (13) are provided in a second portion (12) adjoining 

the first portion (7) in a cross-sectional plane thereof, and a closure part (14) closing the 
said bores (13) and displaceable against the force of a spring (15) and against the component 

(5) connected to the sleeve (6) is provided inside the sleeve (6) in the said cross-sectional 
plane, and the said sleeve (6) is received by a bush (18) axially displaceable 

relative thereto and with a bore (19) adjoined by an inner groove (20) used for receiving 
locking members, in particular locking spheres, and the second portion (12) of the sleeve 

(6) passes through a spring (23) which is supported at one end on the bush (18) and at the 
other end on the component (5) secured to the sleeve (6), and the shaft journal (1) is provided 

with a continuous groove preferably close to its front end (3), 
characterized in 
that
 the first sleeve portion (7) is provided with a plurality of axially parallel longitudinal 
slots (10) and the outer boundary face (9) of the said portion (7) has a conical taper 

diverging towards the receiving side of the sleeve (6), and the bore (19) corresponds to 
the conical taper of the sleeve (6) in order to receive the sleeve (6). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the first portion (7) provided with 
the internal serration (8) is shorter than the second portion (12) of the sleeve (6), and the 

external surface (27) of the said second portion (12) passes into the first portion (7) by 
way of a step (28) or an offset. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diameter of the bores (13) 
situated in a cross-sectional plane of the second portion (12) is as large as the diameter of 

the locking spheres (21), and the depth of the groove (4) preferably provided close to the 
front end (3) of the shaft journal (1) is smaller than half the diameter of the locking 

spheres (21). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the width of the annular space, 
which is bounded on one side by the base of the groove (20) cut into the bush (18) and on 

the other side by the closure part (14) situated in its closure position, con-esponds at least 
to the diameter of the locking spheres (21).  

 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the spring (15) holding the closure 
part (14) in the closure position is constructed in the form of a helical spring which is 

supported at one end thereof on an abutment (17) provided in the sleeve (6), and this 
abutment is preferably constructed in the form of a disc fixed by a press fitting. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the inner walls of the two portions 
(7, 12) of the sleeve (6) have different diameters, and the shoulder (16) formed thereby 

acts as a stop for the closure part (14) held in the closure position by the force of the 
spring (15). 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the closure part (14) is 
constructed in the manner of a cup. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the second portion (12) of the 
sleeve (6) together with the wall of the bore (22) of the bush (18) receiving it bounds an 

annular gap, and the spring (23) supported on the component (5) at one end projects into 
the said annular space. 
A device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the axial length of the annular 
space corresponds approximately to the length of the compressed spring (23) resting 

against the component (5) and pre-stressed in operation. 
A device according to Claim 1,
