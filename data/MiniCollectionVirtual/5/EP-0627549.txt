<ABSTRACT>
The catalytic converter has an axis (2) and a housing (3) with an inlet (10) and an outlet (11). The housing (3) contains hollow cylindrical catalytic elements (20) with an inner surface (25a), an outer surface (21b) and passages (22, 25c) running from the inner surface (25a) to the outer surface (25b) for the exhaust gas. The catalytic elements, in a cross-section at right angles to the axis (2), enclose a catalytic element internal chamber (32), into which the inlet (10) opens and which contains a limiting and/or guide element (33). The latter has a limiting and/or guide surface (33a) approaching the inner surface (25a) of the catalytic elements (20) from the inlet (10), which limiting and/or guide surface distributes the exhaust gas, in operation flowing into the catalytic element inner chamber (32), evenly to the passages (22, 25c) of the catalytic elements (20).
