<ABSTRACT>
An electrolytic process and apparatus is disclosed for 
oxidizing or reducing inorganic and organic species, especially in 

dilute aqueous solutions. The electrolytic reactor includes an 
anode and cathode in contact with a packed bed of particulate ion 

exchange material which establishes an infinite number of transfer 
sites in the electrolyte to significantly increase the mobility of 

the ionic species to be oxidized or reduced toward the anode or 
cathode, respectively. The ion exchange material is cationic for 

oxidation and anionic for reduction, or a combination of both for 
special circumstances. Preferably, the ion exchange material is 

treated to convert a portion of the transfer sites to semiconductor 
junctions which act as mini anodes, or cathodes, to significantly 

increase the capacity of the reactor to oxidize or reduce the 
species to be treated. Exemplary applications for the disclosed 

electrolytic process and apparatus are the conversion of halides to 
halous acids in dilute solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oxidation or reduction of
inorganic and organic species by directing the species through a
packed bed ion exchange electrolytic reactor to produce the desired
oxidized or reduced species.It is generally known that oxidizing inorganic and organic
species in dilute aqueous solutions by electrolysis is nearly
impossible to accomplish because of the poor mobility of these
species in such aqueous solutions to reach the anodic site where
oxidation takes place.An example of this technology, which is not limited in scope
to this example, is the production of halous acids from dilute
concentrations of their corresponding halide salts. Such halous
acids are particularly useful as oxidizing agents. It is known
that electrolyzing dilute halide salts to form their respective
halous acid solutions is difficult to accomplish without forming
other fully oxidized species such as the halates, which have little
oxidizing effect. In order to solve this problem, a number of
anodic systems utilizing noble metal catalysts have been developed
to prevent the halate ion side reactions from taking place. Even
with the latest dimensionally stable anodes, the side reactions
will predominate unless the halide concentration in the aqueous
solution being electrolyzed exceeds 1500 mg/l. At these elevated 
concentrations, a small percentage of the halide can be converted
to the halous ion.In actual practice, however, the halide salt concentration is
kept between 5000 mg/l and 250,000 mg/l in order to convert a small
percentage of the halide directly to the halous solution. At these
high salt concentrations, the side reactions that form the
undesired halate ions are significantly reduced or eliminated.
However, the high concentration of residual salts causes additional
problems. Concentrations of greater than 1500 mg/l of halide ions
cause corrosion of various bimetal connections found in water
plumbing systems, such as water distributors, cooling towers, and
swimming pools, as well as any other aqueous process equipment.
Thus, electrolysis has not proven to be a reasonable method for the
production of halous acids, because the conversion rates are small,
and the residual salts are harmful to the distribution systems.Therefore, in order to control microbiological contamination
in these aqueous systems, highly concentrated and potentially
dangerous halous solutions are dosed into the dilute streams of
water to maintain an adequate concentration of the halous acid
needed to control or destroy the offending or
