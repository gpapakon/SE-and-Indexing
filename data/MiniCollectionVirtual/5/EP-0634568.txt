<ABSTRACT>
A friction clutch especially for a fan impeller (2) of a motor vehicle internal combustion engine or the like is proposed, in which the engine speed is directly transmitted by way of a first pneumatically or hydraulically actuatable friction clutch, a reduced drag speed of the fan impeller being transmitted by way of an eddy current clutch (6) when the friction clutch (5) is disengaged.

Friction clutch for a fan wheel 
of a motor vehicle internal combustion engine or the 

like, the fan wheel (2) being directly connected to a 
drive shaft (4) or the like for the direct transmission 

of the engine rotational speed by means of a first 
friction disc clutch (5) and the fan wheel (2) being 

entrained by a second clutch appliance (6), configured 
as an eddy-current clutch, when the friction disc 

clutch (5) is disengaged, characterized in that the 
friction disc clutch (5) is configured as a pneumatically 

or hydraulically actuated clutch (5) with a 
piston/cylinder unit for the direct drive of the fan 

wheel (2), which piston/cylinder unit can be subjected 
to pressure medium by means of a rotary joint (37) 

and that the drive piston (30) 
actuates an anchor plate (39), which can be axially 

displaced by means of a flexible annular spring plate 
(40, 54) and which interacts with a friction disc 

lining (45) of the friction disc clutch (5). 
Clutch according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the drive shaft (4) of the friction clutch (1) is 

connected directly to the eddy-current clutch (6) by 
means of a drive housing (13), the eddy-current clutch 

(6) being connected at the output end to a fan wheel 
fastening housing (22) for fastening the fan wheel (2) 

and the fan wheel fastening housing (22) being decoupled 
with respect to rotational speed from the drive 

shaft (4) by means of a ball bearing (27). 
Clutch according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the fan wheel fastening housing (22) is 

directly connected to a friction disc clutch accommodation 
housing (18) which has a cylinder space (29, 52) 

for accommodating a drive piston (30) of the 
piston/cylinder unit and in that the axially displaceable 

drive piston (30) actuates the friction disc 
clutch (5) in the sense of subjecting the friction disc 

clutch (5) to pressure or relieving it and, by this 
means, of directly connecting the drive shaft (4) to 

the fan wheel (2) or decoupling the drive shaft (4) 
from the fan wheel (2).  

 
Clutch according to 
claim 3, characterized in that the drive shaft (4) 

is connected to an axially displaceable flexible clutch 
plate (46) which carries a friction disc lining (45) on 

both sides and in that when the drive piston (30) is 
not subjected to pressures the clutch plate (46) is 

frictionally clamped between the anchor plate (39) connected 
to the clutch housing (18) and a counterplate 

(43) firmly connected to the fan wheel fastening housing 
(22). 
Clutch according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the anchor plate (39) 

can be pressed axially against the friction disc lining 
(45) of the friction disc clutch (5) by a plate spring 

(41). 
Clutch according to one or more of the preceding 
claims 1-3, characterized in that when subjected to 

pressure, the drive piston (30) closes the friction 
disc clutch (5) in the sense of a clutch actuation and 

therefore of a direct rotational speed transmission. 
Clutch according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the housing connected 

to the drive shaft (4) acts simultaneously as a 
counterplate (43) of the friction disc clutch (5) for 

the drive-end fastening of the eddy-current clutch (6) 
by means of its radial wall section (51), which 

counterplate (43) interacts with the anchor plate (39) 
when the drive piston (30) is subjected to a force. 
Clutch according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the anchor plate (39) is supported by means of a 

flexible annular spring plate (40, 54) so that it can 
be axially displaced in the clutch housing (18). 
Clutch according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the anchor plate (39)  

 
and the piston (30) form a constructional, axially displaceable 

unit and enclose between them the flexible 
annular spring plate (54). 
Clutch according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drive piston (30) 

is subsjected to pressure by means of a rotary joint 
(37), on the rotatable connection housing (25, 18), 

leading to the pressure space (29) of the piston/cylinder 
unit.
