<ABSTRACT>
A system to quickly locate and identify objects (OBJ.1,OBJ.2,OBJ.N) at a distance in a 
room (10-12) at work or at home. A base station (14-16) in each room (10-12) obtains the 

location of objects in that room, which is communicated to other base stations (14-16) so that 
the information can be interrogated by a user for any of the objects (OBJ.1,OBJ.2,OBJ.N) in any 

of the rooms/locations. The system uses miniature electronic identification devices in the form 
of small, optically coded "tags" (29-31;Fig. 2) that combine active electronics and an IR 

detection method based on a small, low-cost, liquidcrystal display "shutter" built into each tag. 
To obtain the location of the objects (OBJ.1,OBJ.2,OBJ.N), the base system (14-16) in each room 

illuminates the room (10-12) with pulses of infrared light and receives identification code 
sequences reflected by the various objects as they rapidly activate their shutters during the 

pulse. To avoid all the tags flashing at once, causing individual responses to "collide," the 
various tags (29-31;Fig. 2) are programmed to respond at random intervals so that the base 

station (14-16) can locate the objects by processing several pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a remote object identification system, and in particular to a
system employing optical radiation for determining the presence in a room or other enclosure
of certain objects.A great deal of time can be wasted in the home or in a work environment searching
for objects in a room that may be crowded with many other objects The problem is
aggravated where the work environment includes a number of rooms which the object may be
located. An example is a laboratory containing a number of separate rooms where scientific
activities are carried on using valuable portable objects such as oscilloscopes and multimeters,
often carried from room to room Researchers who wish to use such equipment can waste
valuable time conducting a search relying on eyesight to locate the desired equipment.Existing remote identification methods are based on radiotransmission devices.
These are expensive and susceptible to electronic and electromagnetic interference, a serious
problem in a research laboratory using such electronic test equipment and/or computer
monitors which are known to generate much electromagnetic interference.Another remote identification system is in common use in checkout counters at
supermarkets, and is based on light scanners reflecting light from UPC bar codes on products.
The deficiency here is that the bar code usually cannot be more than 6 inches from the scanner,
which is not practical to identify devices located at distances associated with typical home room
dimensions or office space.FR-A-2 667 183 discloses a remote object identifying system using optical radiation. The system of FR-A-2 667 183 comprises means for
generating a first beam of optical radiation and one or more devices in an area or in separate areas and positioned to receive the first beam.
Each of said devices has associated with it means for receiving the first beam and decode a code modulated on the first beam. Upon decoding
a predetermined code the device activates an optical or acoustic signalling device to indicate to a user the position of an object associated with
the device.An object of the invention is to provide a remote identification system using identifier devices which are small. inexpensive and consume little
energy.Another object of the invention is a remote identification system substantially free from electronic or electromagnetic interference.Still another object of the invention is a remote identification system capable of operating over distances involving small and large rooms,
