<ABSTRACT>
Protective articles such as diapers, having 
filmless hydrophobic barrier elements such as cuffs and 

backing sheets. The barrier cuffs - which can be, for 
instance, leg cuffs and waistbands - and the backing 

sheets can be provided from fabrics having a fabric 
weight of at least 10 gsy; these fabrics are made of 

cardable, hydrophobic polyolefin fibers having a dpf 
value of not more than about 2.0.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to barrier element
fabrics and barrier elements prepared from such fabrics, as
well as to the preparation of these fabrics and barrier
elements, and to protective articles incorporating these
elements.Various configurations of waste containment garments
and barrier cuffs are known in the art. Further, different
fibers, fabrics and finishes - e.g., hydrophobic fibers,
fabrics and finishes - are also known.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,657,539 and 4,816,025 both disclose
waste containment barrier cuffs which can be prepared from
different materials, including polypropylene. U.S. Patent
No. 4,657,539 further discloses leg cuffs of material having
a basis weight of about 30 to about 150 grams per square
meter (gsm), prepared from filaments having a denier of from
about 6 to about 15, and specifies a leg cuff member having
a basis weight of about 65 grams per square yard (gsy), or 
77.7 gsm. Herein, the unit gm-2 or g/m2 may be rendered as 'gsm', as is common in this
art.U.S. Patent No. 4,816,025 refers to the barrier cuffs disclosed therein as
preferably being hydrophobic, and more preferably liquid impermeable, and rendered so
in any manner well known in the art - such as selectively treating the barrier cuffs,
untreating the barrier cuffs, or by securing a separate material to the barrier cuffs.European Patent Application 0 486 158 refers to a particularly troublesome
technical problem as arising, when a high degree of hydrophobicity is desired on cuffs
or borders in a diaper or similar product, produced from polyolefin-containing staple.
The problem is indicated to arise from untreated fiber becoming unworkable during
processing, while various finishes make the fiber workable, but render it unsuitably
hydrophilic. Use of a fiber treatment, involving application, as part of the treatment
components, of a neutralized phosphoric acid ester as an antistat, is indicated to render
the fibers processable, without undue loss of hydrophobicity. Mention is made of
polyolefin fiber webs, from fiber not exceeding about 40 dpf (44.4 dTex), and
preferably within a range of about 0.1-40 dpf (0.11-44.4 dTex); staple prepared from
2.0-2.54 dpf (2.2-2.794 dTex) filaments is specifically disclosed. Cover stock is
indicated to vary in weight from about 10-45 gm/yd2 (12-54 gsm), or higher.Canadian Patent Publication 2,089,401 refers to the desirability of hydrophobic
fibers, for nonwoven polyolefin fabrics in applications such as diaper leg cuffs and 
waistbands. Also disclosed therein is a fiber having a
