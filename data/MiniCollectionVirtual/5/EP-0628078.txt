<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses multivalent single chain antibodies which have two or more biologically active antigen binding sites. The multivalent single chain antibodies are formed by using a peptide linker to covalently link two or more single chain antibodies, each single chain antibody having a variable light domain linked to a variable heavy chain domain by a peptide linker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to single chain multivalent antibodies.Antibodies are proteins belonging to a group of immunoglobulins elicited by the
immune system in response to a specific antigen or substance which the body deems foreign.
There are five classes of human antibodies, each class having the same basic structure. The
basic structure of an antibody is a tetramer, or a multiple thereof, composed of two identical
heterodimers each consisting of a light and a heavy chain. The light chain is composed of one
variable (V) and one constant (C) domain, while a heavy chain is composed of one variable and
three or more constant domains. The variable domains from both the light and heavy chain,
designated VL and VH respectively, determine the specificity of an immunoglobulin, while the
constant (C) domains carry out various effector functions.Amino acid sequence data indicate that each variable domain comprises three
complementarity determining regions (CDR) flanked by four relatively conserved framework
regions (FR). The FR are thought to maintain the structural integrity of the variable region
domain. The CDR have been assumed to be responsible for the binding specificity of individual
antibodies and to account for the diversity of binding of antibodies.As the basic structure of an anti body contains two heterodimers, antibodies are
multivalent molecules. For example, the IgG classes have two identical antigen binding sites,
while the pentameric IgM class has 10 identical binding sites.Monoclonal antibodies having identical genetic parentage and binding specificity
have been useful both as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Monoclonal antibodies are
routinely produced by hybridomas generated by fusion of mouse lymphoid cells with an
appropriate mouse myeloma cell line according to established procedures. The administration
of murine antibodies for in vivo therapy and diagnostics in humans is limited however, due to
the human anti-mouse antibody response illicited by the human immune system.Chimeric antibodies, in which the binding or variable regions of antibodies
derived from one species are combined with the constant regions of antibodies derived from a
different species, have been produced by recombinant DNA methodology. See, for example,
Sahagen et al.,J. Immunol.,137 : 1066-1074(1986); Sun et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,82: 214-218 (1987) ; Nishimura et al., Cancer Res.,47:999-1005 (1987) ; and Lie et al. Proc Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA,84: 3439-3443 (1987) which disclose chimeric antibodies to
