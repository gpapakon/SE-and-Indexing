<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for the production of yogurt, in 
which raw materials comprising milk protein 

are pretreated with a transglutaminase. 
Yogurt made by conventional methods tends toward water 

separation. In the present method, the pretreated raw 
materials are subsequently contacted with a lactic starter 

culture for fermentation. Water separation does not occur 
to any adverse extent in the yogurt produced by the present 

method, and the product of the present process retains the 
original smooth texture of yogurt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
production of a smooth yogurt which exhibits no water
separation.Yogurt is a fermented milk product which has been
consumed since ancient times, and in some countries, even
mountain sheep milk and ewe milk are used as the raw
materials. Yogurt is basically produced by contacting milk
with a lactic starter, pouring it into a container for
fermentation and for distribution, such as a bottle or
carton, and allowing it to harden to a pudding form (hard
type). Such a yogurt is a product with an acid-sweet
taste.Alternatively, instead of pouring directly into a
distribution container and fermenting, yogurt is often
crushed after fermentation, then placed into a container
for distribution as a product (soft type). Sweeteners
(e.g., sugar [sucrose]), acidifiers, flavorings,
oligosaccharides, emulsifiers or other desired materials
are added to yogurt during its production. Yogurt produced 
without the addition of such additives is called "plain
type." Alternatively, fruit (pulp or juice), starch or
thickening polysaccharides such as xanthan gum, locust bean
gum, carrageenan or griloid are added to yogurt during
production (fruit type). In the present specification, all
of these types of yogurt shall collectively be referred to
by the name "yogurt."All of the types of yogurt often undergo the
phenomenon of water separation (separation of the whey)
with the passage of time after production, for example,
while being distributed. Yogurt which has undergone water
separation has a lower commercial value, and in extreme
cases, it must be discarded.Thus, a method of preventing
water separation in yogurt is needed.One of the measures used in the past for preventing
water separation in yogurt is to add agar, gelatin, pectin
or the like to the raw materials. Although agar inhibits
water separation, the texture of the yogurt depreciates.
That is, the yogurt has the texture of pudding, and the
original smooth texture of the yogurt is lost. In
addition, the use of agar, gelatin, pectin and the like is
disadvantageous from the standpoint of cost.The prevention of water separation is also achieved by
adding defatted powdered milk or the like to the raw
material to increase the milk solids content. However, the 
difficulties of this method include its high cost and the
undesirable texture produced thereby.In addition, the moisture content of the soft type of
yogurt is typically the same as milk (for example, 88%).
Soft yogurt presents the properties of opalescent, silk-strained

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of yoghurt, comprising:

pretreating raw materials comprising milk protein used
in the production of yoghurt with a transglutaminase in an

amount of 0.01 to 100 units per gram of milk protein, said
raw materials comprising 8 to 11 wt% of non-fat solids, 0 to

7 wt% of milk fat and 0.01 to 5 wt% of sugar and/or a low-calorie
sweetener, the residual amount being water,
deactivating said transglutaminase after said
pretreatment, and
contacting said pretreated raw materials with a lactic
starter for fermentation after deactivating said

transglutaminase.
The method of claim 1, wherein said transglutaminase is
produced by a bacterium belonging to the genus

Streptoverticillium.
