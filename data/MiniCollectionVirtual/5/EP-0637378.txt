<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS SENSORSThe present invention relates to gas sensors and to methods of „ making them.Applicants are particularly, though not exclusively, interested in gas sensors for use in monitoring gases, such as acid gases, e.g. H2S, N02 and S02, in connection for example with industrial process control or environmental protection.It is well known that organic polymers may form the gas sensing material in gas sensors. Such organic materials include conducting polymers which are normally p-type semiconductors whose conductivities are changed when exposed to oxidising gases such as N0χ or reducing gases such as NH3. Sensors using such materials have been based on both electrical technigues and optical technigues (e.g. surface plasinon resonance) .Various organic polymers, such as polyaniline, which appear to be suitable as gas sensing materials are commonly deliberately'doped' to improve the specificivity and/or sensitivity of the materials towards particular gases. Such 'doping' also increases the electrical conductivity and facilitates the*j detection of change in conductivity of the polymer on exposure< to and interaction with the gases being sensed; the change in conductivity being used as a measure of the concentration of the sensed gases. 

With some organic polymers, such as polyaniline, in order for doping to be achieved the cationic part of the dopant can only be a hydrogen ion. In such a case the doped form of the polymer can be regarded as the protonated form.Applicants investigations have revealed that there is a disadvantage with gas sensors comprising such protonated polymers as the sensing material. Applicants have found that the protonated polymers are unstable as gas sensing materials in the sense that they have a tendency to produce inconsistent conductivity readings; thus unreliable results may be obtained. It is believed that this disadvantage is a consequence of the mechanism of the interaction between the gases being sensed and the polymer which involves a direct de- doping or de-protonating process resulting in undesired degradation of the material.An object of the invention is to overcome or alleviate the disadvantages associated with protonated polymeric materials as mentioned above.Accordingly, the present invention provides a gas sensor comprising a film or layer of non-protonated polyaniline as the gas sensing material.In this specification the term "non-protonated" means that less than 1% of the protenatable imine nitrogen in the polyaniline is protonated.
