<ABSTRACT>
Higher molecular weight copolymers of polyaspartic acid which are suitable for the inhibition of scale deposition may be obtained by reacting maleic acid and ammonia in a stoichiometric excess, with a diamine or a triamine, at 120 -350  C, preferably 180 -300  C, and then converting the copolymer of polysuccinimide formed to a salt of a copolymer of polyaspartic acid by hydrolysis with a hydroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COPOLYMERS OF POLYASPARTIC ACID FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a process for the production of copolymers of polysuccinimide, their conversion to salts of copolymers of polyaspartic acid and the use of these materials. ' 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe salts of polyaspartic acid have been used for fertilizers and scale inhibition agents. They ' are particularly useful for the prevention of scale deposition in boiler water, reverse osmosis membranes, detergents and as inhibitors of dental tartar and plaque formation (tartar barrier agents). These materials are readily biodegradable. Economic methods of production of polyaspartic acid having a higher 10 molecular weight is desirable to provide materials having a greater retention on the object wherein inhibition of scale deposition is desired, and to provide greater stability to biodegradation in addition to their intrinsic value for the prevention of scale deposition in boiler water, reverse osmosis membranes, detergents and as inhibitors of dental tartar and plaque formation (tartar barrier agents).Highly functionalized, yet readily biodegradable materials, which function as inhibitors of scale15 deposition are desirable for use as fertilizers, in detergents, in water treatment, and in control of tartar.The problem of obtaining higher molecular weight polymers of amino acids has been given a great deal of thought due to the rapid degradation of these polymers, especially in the mouth. A major drawback to the use of such polymers as antitartar agents is the lifetime that such polymers have in the mouth. Achieving a means by which a higher molecular weight agent can be obtained is desirable from20 both an economic and a use standpoint.DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART A number of methods of preparation of polyaspartic acid are disclosed in the literature and other patents, however, no mention is made of methods of preparation of copolymers of polyaspartic acid. U.S. Pat. 4,839,461 discloses a method for making polyaspartic acid from maleic acid and 25 ammonia by reacting these constituents in a 1:1 -1.5 molar ratio by raising the temperature to 12CT -150° C. over a period of 4-6 hours and maintaining it for 0-2 hours. It is further disclosed that temperatures above 140° C. result in elimination of CC., thus teaching degradation of the material. The molecular weight range obtained by this method was said to be 1,000-4,000 with a cluster at 1,800-2,000. It is further disclosed that this material is useful in the prevention of tarnishing on glass
