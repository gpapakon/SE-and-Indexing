<ABSTRACT>
A non-azeotropic refrigerant mixture is provided for use in heat pumps which provides improved efficiency, in terms of coefficient of performance and compressor power, than available refrigerants or mixtures thereof. The refrigerant is a ternary mixture of 1 % to 10 % R23 (trifluoromethane), 1 % to 70 % R125 (pentafluoroethane), with the balance being R32 (methylene fluoride; difluoromethane). The mixture can be used in heat pumps and other machines designed for R22 and/or R502 without modification, and is environmentally acceptable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a non-azeotropic refrigerant mixture, suitable 
as a working fluid for heat pump applications as well as in other vapour 
compression machines. By use of this mixture, the cooling and heating efficiencies 
of heat pumps can be significantly improved. The mixture is entirely compatible 
with R22 and R502 refrigerants currently used in heat pumps, and so does not 
require changes in the design of such heat pumps. R22 is chlorodifluoromethane 
(CHCLF2) and R502 is a mixture of R22 and R115 which is 
chloropentafluoroethane (CHCF2CHF3). However, other vapour compression 
equipment can use the mixture as a drop-in replacement for presently used 
refrigerants, depending on the mixture composition. In addition, with these 
compositions, the mixture is environmentally acceptable. The thermodynamic performance of an energy conversion device may 
be improved by using a non-azeotropic mixture in a vapour cycle. A non-azeotropic 
mixture has a temperature distribution parallel to that of the 
surrounding fluid with which heat transfer takes place during the evaporation and 
condensation processes which are part of the cycle. Interest has increased in 
recent years in the use of non-azeotropic refrigerant mixtures (NARM) to improve 
the performance of energy conversion devices. Various NARM have been proposed or used in the past. Usually, these 
have two components, but some having three (i.e. ternary mixtures) have been 
proposed, for example in:
