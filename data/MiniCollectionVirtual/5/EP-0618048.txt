Knife (10) having a blade (13), which is guided in a 
hollow handle (11) and has a holding extension (14), upon 

which on the one hand an energy storage mechanism (16) 
acts rearwards in the insertion direction (arrow 15) of 

the holding extension in a longitudinal direction of the 
handle and which on the other hand forms part of a 

locking device (20) which, upon latching, holds the blade 
in the extended working position and which, upon 

attainment of a predetermined response threshold for the 
acceleration of the knife (10), unlatches and in so doing 

allows the blade to move under the action of the energy 
storage mechanism (16) into the hollow handle (11), 


characterized in that
 disposed inside the handle (11) is 
at least one micro-electronically operable acceleration 

sensor, such as a capacitive acceleration sensor (21) or 
the li
ke, which measures each change in the translational 
and angular acceleration of the handle and through the 

agency of an electrical transmission device (22), when an 
adjusted setpoint value of acceleration is exceeded, 

unlatches the locking device (20) and allows the blade 
(13) to move under the action of the energy storage 

mechanism (16) into the hollow handle (11). 
Knife according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
electrical transmission device (22) comprises an 

electronic computer (23) having a setpoint/actual-value 
comparison device (24). 
Knife according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
the capacitive acceleration sensor (21) comprises a two-axis 

acceleration sensor (29, 30) with integrated signal 
processing in the form of a bending beam (31) as an 

electrode, which in its middle region (32) is connected 
to the substrate (28) and in its remaining regions is  

 
freely deflectable relative to the stationary counter-electrode 

(33). 
Knife according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
acceleration sensor (29, 30) at the freely deflectable 

end (35) of its bending beam (31) is provided with a 
plurality of comb teeth (36), which are symmetrically or 

asymmetrically associated with corresponding comb teeth 
(37) of the counter-electrode (33) which is connected in 

a stationary manner to the substrate (28). 
Knife according to claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterized in 
that
 two acceleration sensors (29, 30) are disposed 
offset by 90Â° relative to one another on the same 

substrate (28). 
Knife according to claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterized in 
that
 two acceleration sensors (29, 30) in the form of the 
bending beams (31) are disposed parallel to one another 

on the same substrate (28), with, on account of the 
asymmetrical position of the comb teeth (36, 37) of the 

two electrodes (31, 33), in each case the one 
acceleration sensor (29) responding to linear 

accelerations and the other sensor (30) responding only 
to angular accelerations. 
Knife according to one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in 
that
 a voltage stabilizer (27) is connected upstream of 
the acceleration sensors (29, 30) and a voltmeter (24) 

electronically connected to the computer (23) is 
connected as a setpoint/actual-value comparison device 

downstream of the acceleration sensors (29, 30). 
Knife according to one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in 
that
 the unlatching device of the locking device (20) 
comprises an electromagnet (18), which is operable by a 

voltage/current source (26) via the computer (23) and by  
 

means of which a locking pin (19), which engages as a 
locking device (20) into a recess (17) of the holding 

extension (14), is withdrawable. 
Knife according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in 
that
 the energy storage mechanism comprises either an 
electromagnet or in a known manner a cylindrical helical 

spring (16), which extends in a longitudinal direction 
(arrow 15) of the hollow handle (11) and is fastened by 

one end to the holding extension (14) and by its other 
end to the inner wall of the handle (11). 
Knife according to one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in 
that
 the voltage stabilizer (27), the capacitive 
acceleration sensors (29, 30), the voltmeters (24), the 

computer (23) and the unlatching device (18) of the 
locking device (20) are disposed inside the hollow handle 

(11). 
Knife according to one of claims 8 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 the voltage/current source (26) comprises either 
a battery, which is likewise disposed in or on the handle 

(11), or a low-voltage cable with a voltage of 6 to 12 V, 
which is introduced into the handle (11) and is connected 

by a low-voltage transformer to a conventional voltage 
source of 220 V.
