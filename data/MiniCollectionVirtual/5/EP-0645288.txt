<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for detecting a wheel grip on road has 
a wheel speed sensor (1) for detecting a revolution speed 

of a wheel of a vehicle, a plurality of band-pass filters 
(2₁, 2₂, ... 2
n
) for filtering an output of the wheel speed 
sensor at a plurality of frequency bands, and a reference 

value memory device (3) for storing in memory reference 
values dependent on the revolution speed of the wheel. 

The reference values are set for each of the frequency 
bands of the plurality of band-pass filters (2₁, 2₂, ... 

2
n
). The wheel grip on road is detected based on the 
correlation between that signal output for each of the 

frequency bands which is obtained through the band-pass 
filters (2₁, 2₂, ... 2
n
) and that reference value for each 
of the frequency bands which is stored in memory in the 

reference value memory device (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
detecting a wheel grip on road, i.e., a condition of wheel
contact with ground, in order to detect so-called
hydroplaning or aquaplaning phenomena which occur when a
vehicle is running at a high speed on a road surface which
is wet with water.The hydroplaning phenomena can be classified into a
complete hydroplaning in which wheels of the vehicle are
completely running on a film of water and a partial
hydroplaning in which, though the wheels of the vehicle
are lifted or suspended by the film of water, the wheels
are still partially maintaining contact with the road
surface.Once the complete hydroplaning phenomena have
occurred, the wheels come to be subjected to a strong
resistance from the film of water. It is known, then, to
detect the occurrence of the hydroplaning phenomena based
on differential changes in a revolution speed of the
wheels of the vehicle.In the partial hydroplaning, however, the resistance
that the wheels receive from the film of water is not very
large. Therefore, it is difficult to detect the
occurrence of the partial hydroplaning by the conventional 
methodIt is known from German Patent Application No. DE-A-3421253
to measure the undulations of the road
surface on which a vehicle runs based on the
acceleration and deceleration of the revolution speed
of a wheel of the vehicle.As a result of diligent studies, the inventors of
the present invention have found out that, once the
partial hydroplaning has occurred, those frequency
components of higher harmonics which are contained in
an output signal of a wheel speed sensor for detecting
a revolution speed of a wheel deviate by several Hz
towards the low-frequency side by receiving a viscous
resistance due to the film of water.The present invention has been made based on this
finding and has an object of providing an apparatus
that can detect the occurrence of the partial
hydroplaning.In order to attain the above and other objects,
the present invention is an apparatus for detecting a
wheel grip on a road comprising: a wheel speed sensor
for detecting a revolution speed of a wheel of a
vehicle; characterised by a plurality of band-pass
filters for filtering an output of the wheel speed
sensor at a plurality of frequency bands; reference
value memory means for storing in memory reference
values dependent on the revolution speed of the wheel,
the reference values being set for each of the
frequency bands of the plurality of band-pass filters;
and detecting means for detecting the wheel
