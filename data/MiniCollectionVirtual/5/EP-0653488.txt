<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a polyribonucleotide having a thermodynamically stable looped structure and a ribozyme activity, a 
DNA which codes for the same, and so forth. The polyribonucleotide is exemplified by the one with structure (b). When administered 

to the human body directly, the ribozyme polyribonucleotide can incise the target polyribonucleotide 
in vivo
 efficiently, thus 
being utilizable as a carcinostatic agent, anti-AIDS drug, and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyribonucleotide
having a thermodynamically stable loop structure and
ribozyme activity, a DNA that codes for said
polyribonucleotide, an expression vector containing said
DNA, a host cell transfected with said expession vector,
and a process for cleaving a specific site of a substrate
polyribonucleotide by said polyribonucleotide having
ribozyme activity.The (+) chain of satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot
virus and the (+) chain and (-) chain of avocado sunblotch
viroid are cleaved by their own catalytic activity in the
presence of Mg2+ (Science 231, 1577-1580 (1986)). The
RNA structure necessary for this cleavage activity has
been determined and named as Hammerhead ribozyme (Nucleic
Acids Res. 14, 3627-3640 (1986)). The nucleotide
sequences in the vicinity of the cleavage sites of these
RNA possesses common sequences, and the secondary
structure of these RNA was predicted from these common
sequences. Uhlenbeck designed a short chain RNA fragment
of 19 mer based on these common sequences, and indicated 
that said fragment catalytically cleaves RNA of 24 mec
(Nature, 328, 596-600 (1987)).In addition, besides viroid and viral satellite RNA,
the transcript of newt satellite DNA is also reported to
have ribozyme nucleotide sequences (Cell, 48, 535-543,
(1987)).The inventors of the present invention chemically
synthesized two types of 21 mer RNA having nucleotide
sequences in the vicinity of the cleavage site of this
newt satellite DNA transcript. When one of the RNA was
added to the other, a cleavage reaction was found to occur
at the same site as that in nature (FEBS Lett., 228,
228-230, (1988)). In addition, based on this result, the
inventors of the present invention found a process for
cleaving other RNA or polyribonucleotide molecules using
ribozyme (Nucleic Acids Res., 17, 7059-7071, (1989)).On the other hand, a cleavage reaction was also caused
on the (-) chain of the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot
virus, and that cleavage has been determined to occur at a
specific site (Nature 323, 349-353 (1986)). In addition,
the minimum region of RNA necessary for this cleavage has
also been recently clarified (Biochemistry, 28, 4929-4933
(1989)). RNA having this catalytic activity is composed
of 50 nucleotides, and a model having a hairpin Loop
structure within this RNA has been advocated. This RNA
has been given the name hairpin ribozyme. The present
inventors and other research groups converted the 
nucleotides of this hairpin ribozyme to other nucleotides,
and used
