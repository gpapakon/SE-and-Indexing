<ABSTRACT>
A disaster prevention monitor is disclosed in which the 
power consumption during a line monitoring process is reduced, 

and a disconnection or a short circuit of control lines can be 
detected by using a single switching means. A central station (10) 

has a monitor command transmitter for transmitting a monitor 
command signal to initiate monitoring of power and control 

lines. A terminal or repeater station (20) has circuitry for 
controlling the connection of control lines between a line 

monitor and power lines. During normal conditions, the control 
lines are not connected to the power lines, but become so 

connected only in response to a command from the central 
station. A line monitoring command causes generation of a 

negative voltage which is applied to line monitoring circuitry 
to actuate such circuitry for monitoring the status of the 

power and control lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alarm system, capable
of monitoring itself, according to the preamble of claim 1.Examined Japanese Utility Model Application No. Sho.
63-39820 discloses a conventional fault detection circuit for
a bell line as shown in Fig. 1, including: a bell B to which a
diode is connected in series between first terminal B+ and
second terminal B-, and resistor Re and diode De connected in
parallel therewith; a first switch Q1 which is connected in
series between the first terminal and a positive potential,
and which is turned on by a fire signal; a second switch Q2
which is connected in series between the second terminal B- and
ground and which is turned on by the fire
signal; a monitor current detection circuit Q3 connected
between the first terminal B+ and ground
and a voltage detection circuit Q4 connected between the first
terminal B+ and ground.In the conventional fault detection circuit, during a
normal monitor period, a positive voltage is output from a 
power source in that a positive potential is provided to the second terminal so that a monitor
current flows to turn on the monitor current detection circuit.When the bell lines are disconnected, the monitor
current does not flow so as to turn off the monitor current
detection circuit Q3, thereby detecting the disconnection state.
When the bell lines are shortcircuited, the voltage detection
circuit Q4 is turned on.When a fire breaks out, the first and second switches
are on to invert the polarity so that the positive voltage is
applied to the first terminal to ring the bell. At this time,
the monitor current detection circuit and the voltage detection
circuit is turned off.However, in the conventional fault detection circuit
for a bell line, a current is always supplied to lines so as to
detect a disconnection or a shortcircuit of the lines.
Accordingly, there is a problem that the current for monitoring
the lines is consumed even during a normal monitor period.Furthermore, since two switching devices for inverting
the polarity of the terminals are required, the two switching
devices must be controlled simultaneously. In other words,
there is another problem that, when a plurality of bell lines
are connected to such a detection circuit, switching devices
for inversion corresponding to the plurality of bell lines are
required.A reduced current comsumption circuit is known from US-A-5,008,662
which shows a system for the remote supervision of control loads in general
in which the power supply circuit for an entire remote
