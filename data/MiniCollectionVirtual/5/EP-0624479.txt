<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to realize a portable, 
compact, light, thin, inexpensive and fast printer apparatus. 

A motor is provided between a printing head unit and a 
stationary frame member (21) to driv
e the printing head unit (11) 
relative to the stationary frame member (21) in leftward and 

rightward directions, thereby eliminating conventional 
indirect driving components such as a stepping motor and a 

lead screw. Further, a sensor (24) is provided in the printing 
head unit to detect a moving velocity and a position of the 

printing head unit (11) to thereby construct the printer apparatus 
having reduced number of components to ensure stable driving 

and high accuracy. According to such a construction, the 
motor is integrated into the printing head unit (11), which self-moves 

in the printer apparatus to eliminate a mechanism 
converting a rotational movement into a linear movement, 

thereby achieving cost down of the printing apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printer apparatus, and particularly
relates to a printer apparatus using an ultrasonic motor for driving a
printing head unit according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a printer
apparatus using an ultrasonic motor is for example known from US-A-5
155 418. A similar printer apparatus using an ultrasonic motor is for
example known from EP- 0 577 376, which constitutes prior art in the
sense of Art. 54(3) EPC with respect to the present invention.Recently, down-sizing of an electronic instrument is required in the
information processing field, hence the printer apparatus also needs to
have a compact size, a light weight and a good portability as an output
instrument. In this regard, research and development are conducted to
reduce the size and weight of components. However, down-sizing of the
existing components almost reaches a limit.Conventionally, a compact printer apparatus uses one or a plurality of
stepping motors or else for driving a printing head carrier and feeding a
record paper medium. Particularly, with regard to the driving of the
printing head, generally a rotational movement of the motor is converted
into a linear movement by means of a timing belt or a lead screw.Namely, in the prior art, a stepping motor is utilized for driving the
printing head so that various components such as a timing belt or a lead
screw are indispensable, thereby increasing the number of components.
Further, the see of the stepping motor is not reduced extremely because a 
given driving torque should be maintained. Therefore, it is quite difficult to
effect further down-sizing by simply compacting the existing components.In order to solve the problems of the prior art, an object of the present
invention is to provide a portable, compact and inexpensive printer
apparatus having a light weight.Another object of the present invention is to provide a printer apparatus
having a thin shape.A further object of the present invention is to provide a fast printer
apparatus. These problems are not addressed in US-A-5 155 418 nor is
any solution for them suggested in that prior art document.The above mentioned objects and other objects as well as novel features
are made apparent from the following description of the specification and
the attached drawings.In the printer apparatus according to the present invention, an ultrasonic
motor is formed between a printing head unit and a stationary frame
member, such that the printing head unit is driven by the motor in
leftward and rightward
