<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production by resin injection moulding 
of fibre reinforced articles from fibrous material bonded in a 

curable matrix material which articles comprise two or more 
spokes (2, 3, 4) extending from a hub portion (1), each spoke 

(2, 3, 4) being in the form of a loop is characterised in that the 
fibrous material is arranged such that at least as many 

rovings (13, 14, 15 or 22, 23, 24) of the fibrous material as 
there are spokes (2, 3, 4) extend in continuous paths from the 

hub portion (1) around each of the spokes, each of the 
rovings being overlaid for at least part of its length by each of 

the other rovings. The method is suitable for the production 
of intricately shaped articles which are to be highly stressed 

for example by being subjected to high rotational speeds.
