<ABSTRACT>
This invention is concerned about an apparatus for controlling 
the direction and velocity of a hydraulic actuator (50) using a 

micro-computer (30) which comprises means for switching the selection 
(10) and the moving direction of a hydraulic actuator (50), 

and means (40) for 
regulating the oil amount supplied to the actuator (50) to control the 

actuating speed, wherein each means is operated independently and 
thereby the actuator (50) can be controlled precisely irrespective of the 

load change with the further characteristics such as simple 
structure, wide applicability, low manufacturing cost and 

compatibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned about an apparatus for controlling 
direction and velocity of a hydraulic actuator using a 
micro-computer, more particularly, an apparatus for controlling 
precisely the moving direction and velocity of a hydraulic actuator 
in a hydraulic system consisting of a hydraulic pump,a hydraulic 
valve, and a hydraulic actuator. Generally, in a hydraulic system with electronic control means 
such as micro-computer as shown in figure 1, the oil amount 
required for actuating a hydraulic actuator 50 is supplied from a 
hydraulic pump 40 by applying an operating command signal from 
a manipulation device 10 such as joystick to a controller 30 which 
applies an electric signal proportional to the operating command 
signal to a solenoid controlled proportional valve 20. However, in the conventional hydraulic system as described in 
the above, there has been problem that the moving velocity of the 
hydraulic actuator 50 is not equal to the velocity required from a 
controller 30 which is given by an operating command signal from  
 
a manipulation device 10, since the velocity varies with the load of 
the hydraulic actuator 50. This problem makes it difficult to 
control precisely the direction and velocity of the hydraulic actuator 
50. Accordingly, in order to prevent the velocity variance with the 
load of the hydraulic actuator 50, the hydraulic system 
incorporating a regulating valve 60 in a hydraulic circuit as shown 
in figure 2 has been used. However, in this system, there have 
been problems of the increased manufacture cost due to the 
complex hydraulic circuit, the energy waste due to the pressure 
decrease in the regulating valve 60 and the unpreventable free 
falling due to the self-weight of actuator, particularly in a heavy 
hydraulic actuator.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus 
for controlling the moving direction and velocity of a hydraulic 
actuator in which the velocity change of a hydraulic actuator due 
to the load change can be prevented, and the precise control by an 
operating command signal can be achieved. It is another object of the present invention to provide an 
apparatus for controlling the moving direction and velocity of a 
hydraulic actuator which can be manufactured with a relatively 
low cost due to the structure characteristics such as simple design, 
modular type, and small size, and which can be applied in the 
various hydraulic actuator systems. It is also another object of the present invention to provide an 
appa
