<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to push-chairs for infants.Conventionally push-chairs/buggys are mounted on four wheels, or four pairs
of wheels, at the corners of a substantially rectangular base. This
arrangement has the benefit of providing a stable vehicle which is fairly light
in weight and fairly compact when folded. However, it has the severe
drawback of being only suitable for use on smooth surfaces such as tarmac.
The small wheels follow surface ruts and balk at small stones.A further drawback of conventional push-chairs is their limited
manoeuvrability. The push-chairs are generally either provided with swivel-mounted
front wheels to facilitate turning but to the detriment of linear
movement or the front wheels do not have the capacity to swivel and,
therefore, the operator of the push-chair must tilt the push-chair rearwardly
to raise the front wheels off the ground and pivot the push-chair laterally on
the rear two wheels. In the latter case, conventional push-chair design gives
an awkward weight distribution that represents a substantial burden to the
operator when tilting the push-chair.Over many years of design development the configuration of the push chair
has altered little in essence. Push-chairs do now exist having a tricycle
configuration but these have a centralized centre of gravity and, therefore, 
fails to address the principle short-coming of existing push-chair design.In the field of go-cart design it has long ago been proposed to provide a mobile infant's chair of
which the centre of gravity of the occupied chair overlies a central coaxial series of axles
carrying the main wheels of the go-cart, as described in US 1, 429,966. Such a go-cart lacks,
however, the benefits of a pushchair and is limited in its manoeuvrability.Furthermore, pushchairs such as that described in US 3, 229 990, over which the present
invention is characterised also lack good manoeuvrability.According to the present invention there is provided a push-chair for infants which comprises:
a frame (1), having a seat (29) for a child, substantially rigidly mounted on one or more main
load-bearing wheels (2, 2'), in use, the or each said main wheel being mounted rollably to a
primary axle (3), the push-chair being adapted such that the centre of gravity of the occupied
push-chair lies substantially over said primary axle, at least during horizontal travel when the
child occupant remains seated substantially upright, and the push-chair having one or more front
and/or rear stabilisers (8, 9, 9') to prevent

A push-chair for infants which comprises:

a frame (1), having a seat (29) for a child, substantially rigidly mounted on one or more
main load-bearing wheels (2, 2'), in use, the or each said main wheel being mounted

rollably to a primary axle (3), the push-chair being adapted such that the centre of
gravity of the occupied push-chair lies substantially over said primary axle, at least

during horizontal travel when the child occupant remains seated substantially upright,
and the push-chair having one or more front and/or rear stabilisers (8, 9, 9') to prevent

over-tilting of the push-chair about the said primary axle the seat being positioned or
positionable to face forwardly in the direction of travel, the push chair having a handle

stem (5, 5') extending rearwardly in use and when at rest, the handlestem having one or
more handle grips for gripping by the operator with their two hands spaced widely apart,


characterised in that
 the or each said main wheel may alternatively by mounted to a
coaxial series of axles extending transversely of the push-chair, and 
in that
 the or each
said front and/or rear stabilisers has a secondary axle or coaxial series of axles with

one or more wheels or rollers (10, 32) thereon, and the stabiliser(s) and the axle(s) and
wheels or rollers of the stabiliser(s) are adapted to enable the push-chair to be pivoted

about said secondary axle(s) of the or each stabiliser thereby to climb a kerb.
A push-chair as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the front stabiliser (8) has
said one or more wheels or rollers (32, 32') thereon.
A push-chair as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the rear stabiliser (9, 9') also
has said one or more wheels or rollers (10, 10') thereon.
A push-chair as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the main wheels (2,

2') of the push-chair have a diameter, including thickness of tyre where present, greater
than 15 centimetres. 
A push-chair as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the handle
stem (5, 5') extends substantially radially relative to the primary axle or series

of axles (3).
A push-chair as claimed in Claim 5, wherein an inner angle greater than
120Â° is subtended between the base of the seat (29) and the handle stem (5, 5').
A push-chair as claimed in any preceding Claim having a trailer hingedly
mounted to the main axle (3) of the push-chair or to the handle shaft (5, 5').
A push-chair as claimed in any preceding Claim having a seat formed as
a tub to substantially enclose at least the lower body of a push-chair occupant.
