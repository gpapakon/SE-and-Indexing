<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a patterned shaped article 
includes the steps of forming a course of dry particles 1 

on a base surface; using an air flow controller having 
either a suction port 11 or a blow port 12 or both a 

suction port and a blow port to cause an air flow to form 
a cavity 4 in the dry particle course by removing a part 

of the particles thereof under the control of at least one 
parameter among air pressure, air flow rate, air flow 

speed, air flow direction, air flow pulsation, air flow 
intermittence, suction port size, blow port size, suction 

port position and blow port position; charging the cavity 
with a different type of dry particles 2; and allowing the 

particles to set into an integral mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing
patterned shaped articles using an air flow controller,
more particularly to such a method for producing patterned
concrete shaped articles, patterned artificial stone
shaped articles, patterned raw products for sintering into
ceramic shaped articles, patterned ceramic shaped
articles, patterned metal shaped articles, patterned
impasto shaped articles, patterned plastic shaped
articles, patterned shaped foodstuffs and the like, and to
an apparatus for producing patterned shaped articles.Up to now the only way available for providing a
part of a surface, such as of paving blocks, with a
pattern indicating a crosswalk, a stop sign or other such
traffic control mark or for providing the entire surface
of the blocks with a pattern has been to paint the surface
with a coating material such as paint or to inlay the
desired pattern.Since the patterns painted on a part or all of
the surface of paving blocks are exposed to abrasion from,
for example, the shoes of pedestrians walking on the
blocks and the tires of vehicles driving over them, they
quickly wear off and have to be redone at frequent
intervals. The amount of labor involved in this work is
considerable. Where the pattern is formed by inlaying, 
the work itself is troublesome and very costly.GB 2 215 266 A discloses a method of forming a
patterned object in which a framework ("biscuit cutter")
must first be inserted into a course of particles and
then the particles from within the framework can be
extracted and replaced by another material. Thus the
pattern formed is dictated entirely by the framework and
the manufacturing process includes the steps of inserting
and removing the framework in addition to removing the
desired particles.EP 0 611 639 A which has a priority date earlier
than that of the present application but which was
published after the priority date of the present
application also discloses a method in which a framework
(form) must be inserted into a course of particles. The
patterns produced are dictated by the framework.An object of this invention is to provide a method
and an apparatus for producing various types of patterned
shaped articles with surface patterns formed by pattern
courses of prescribed thickness, by use of an air flow
controller and preferably computer control.According to one aspect of the present invention
there is provided a method of producing a patterned
shaped article, comprising the steps of forming a course
of dry particles on a base surface, removing a part of
