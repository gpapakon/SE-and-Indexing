<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a process for producing composite boards, where in a continuous process a core web (2) is coated with a mortar layer reinforced with glass cloth or the like. Hardening mortar is applied in a fluid state of a specified viscosity for spreading and is subject to a controlled feed.

A method of producing composite boards, wherein a 
core web (2) is coated in a continuous process with a 

layer of mortar reinforced with glass fibre fabric or 
the like, the core web (2), which is of plastic foamed 

material (2') and/or fibres, balls, chips, strips or 
pieces of organic and/or inorganic materials, being 

supplied horizontally in the form of an endless web (2) 
and hardening mortar flowing in a liquid state and 

being distributed on the side of the core web for 
coating, characterised in that
 
a glass fibre fabric web is laid sufficiently tightly 

on the surface of the core web (2) to leave just one 
adhesive layer between the glass-fibre fabric web and 

the core web,
 
a stripper (10) distributes the mortar so that the 

layer (9) of mortar embeds the web of glass fibre 
fabric and
 
the still-wet mortar layer (9) then dries and sets. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the consistency of the mortar, which is applied in 

the liquid state, to DIN 1060 (measurement of spread 
using Wickert ring) results in a spread of 22 to 28 cm. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the mortar, which is applied in the liquid state, 

runs through two closely adjacent rotating rollers 
(105, 106) on to the core web (2).  

 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the rollers rotate in the same direction. 
A method according to claim 3 or 4, characterised 
in that the distance between and the speed of rotation 

of the rollers (105, 106) are controllable. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a sensor (13) records the extent of the surge (11) 

of mortar forming in front of a stripper (10), and the 
amount of mortar flowing out of a supply device (4) is 

adjusted by opening or closing a metering device (5) on 
the supply device (4). 
A method according to claims 5 and 6, 
characterised in that the speed of the rollers (1
05, 
106) is altered in order to control the metering 

process. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the core web (2) bearing the 

still-wet mortar layer (9) and the glass-fibre 
reinforcement is cut in the region of joints or at 

chosen intervals and then dries and is hardened by 
heat-treatment. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a core web is produced by compacting a layer of 

fibres (22, 22'), balls, chips or pieces of organic or 
inorganic materials. 
A method according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the layer of fibres (22, 22'), balls, chips,  

 
strips or pieces of organic and/or inorganic materials 

is so coated with extruder foam (21) that the extruder 
foam (21) permeates the fibres (22, 22'), balls, chips, 

strips, pieces or the like of organic and/or inorganic 
materials. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the foamed material (2') 

comprises polystyrene foam, foam glass or loose or 
foamed recycling material or wood-bonding board 

material. 
A method according to claim 8, characterised in 
that after the reinforced mortar layer has dried and 

been left to set on one flat side of the core web, the 
composite board, which is finished on one side, is 

turned and the method is repeated on the other, 
hitherto uncoated, flat side. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the mortar is initially coarsely 

distributed and the glass fibre web (7) is embedded in 
the coarsely-distributed mortar. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the thickness of the set 

reinforced mortar layer (9) is at least 0.2 mm. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the glass fibre fabric is 

conveyed via a web reservoir (19).
