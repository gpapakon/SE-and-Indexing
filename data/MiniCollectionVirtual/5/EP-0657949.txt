further comprises a protective layer of ceramics 
containing a nitride, which is provided to at least cover 

the surface of the superconducting layer exposed on the 
ceramics elongated substrate. A method of manufacturing a 

superconducting ceramics elongated body by forming a 
longitudinally continuous superconducting layer on at 

least a part of the surface of a flexible ceramics 
elongated substrate. The superconducting layer is formed 

on the elongated substrate by a sol-gel method, a 
coating/sintering method, evaporation under oxygen ions, 

deposition from a fluoride solution or oxidation after 
application of corresponding fluorides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a superconducting ceramics elongated body
comprising a longitudinally extending oxide ceramics
superconducting layer.This application is a divisional application of
European Patent No. 0 304 061 directed to a suprconducting
ceramics elongated body and a method for manufacturing
same. Likwise superconducting ceramics elongated bodies and
methods for manufacturing same are claimed in co-pending
applications EP-0 661 763 and EP-A-0 725 448 which are
further divisional applications of EP-B-0 304 061.In recent years, a superconducting material of oxide
ceramics has been highlighted because of its high critical
temperature. The range of practicable use of such a
superconducting material is being widened with increase in
critical temperature. For example, study has been made in
order to apply the material to a power transmission medium
etc. in the field of power transmission/distribution. See
in this respect Applied Physics letters, volume 51, July -
December 1987, pages 203 to 204, "High Tc superconductors-composite
wire fabrication" by S. Jin et. al.The first problem to be solved for applying an oxide
ceramics superconducting material to a power transmission
medium or the like is how to elongate such a
superconducting material. Further, a satisfactorily
elongated superconducting material must have appropriate
flexibility since the same is wound on a reel or the like
in practice. Thus, the second problem to be solved for 
applying the oxide ceramics superconducting material to a
power transmission medium or the like is how to provide
appropriate flexibility.From EP-A-0 303 412 forming prior art in accordance
with Art. 54(3) EPC superconductor-coated carbon fiber
composite is known comprising a carbon fiber base coated
with a superconducting layer.US-A-4,014,706 discloses a composition of matter each
consisting essentially of a solid solution of compounds and
halide binder aid. EP-A-0 192 040 discloses a fluoride
infiltrated carbide or nitride composite. US-A-4,419,125
discloses a method of preparing submicron-superconducting
particles for use in forming a ductile wire therefrom. This
known method utilizes preparing a mixture of solid metal
halides containing essentially stoichiometric proportions
of metallic components for the desired superconductin
compound, co-reducing the mixture with an excess of liquid
alkali metal, removing the alkali metal, and annealing the
superconducting powder.An object of the present invention is to provide a
