<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle such as a van has a sliding door 
(12) movable between open and closed positions. An 

electric power source (330), a door drive switch (282) 
and electric door drive apparatus are connected in 

series on the vehicle body to move the door (12) when 
the switch (282) is closed. Contacts (300) on the 

vehicle body and door engage as the door nears its 
closed position; and the door contacts (301) are 

connected through circuitry, such as an unlatch motor 
armature, having a first resistance. One of the body 

contacts (300) is connected to ground and the other is 
connected, through circuitry including a resistor of 

greater resistance than the unlatch motor armature, to 
a junction of the door drive switch and the electric 

door drive apparatus. An output terminal (315-317) 
connected between the resistor and the other body 

contact (300) provides a signal voltage having 
different levels depending on engagement of the body 

and door contacts (300,301). The resistor may be 
connected to the other body contact (300) through an 

activating switch for the unlatch motor, in its 
non-activated condition, with the output terminal 

connected therebetween, so as to isolate the output 
terminal from transients generated during unlatch 

motor activation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of 
electrically driven doors on motor vehicles: in 
particular, electrically driven, sliding doors for 
vans. Sliding vehicle doors of the prior art, 
which are primarily manually moved, generally have no 
permanent electrical connection, such as wires or 
sliding electrical contacts, to the vehicle body. 
Electric power for door mounted power lock or unlatch 
actuators is only required when the door is closed and 
is thus provided through contacts on the body and door 
which engage as the door reaches its closed position. 
The contacts on the vehicle body or door may be of the 
type including spring loaded plungers which are 
compressed as the door nears its closed position. 
These plungers can generate a force opposing door 
closing, due to the compressed springs, which might be 
misinterpreted by a power door closing system as an 
obstruction and thus prevent the door from being 
completely closed and latched. DE-A-4038241 discloses 
an arrangement in accordance with the preamble of 
claim 1. The present invention seeks to provide 
improved control of an electrically driven vehicle 
door. A vehicle in accordance with the present 
invention is characterised over DE-A-4038241 by the 
features specified in the characterising portion of 
claim 1. It is possible to provide a signal when 
contact is first made between the door and body 
mounted power contacts so that power door closing can 
be completed and the door securely latched. It is 
also possible to provide a signal of door closure, 
either to the vehicle operator or to the power door 
closing system; and detection of contact engagement 
may provide such a signal.  
 The existence of electrical apparatus, 
including body and door mounted contacts, for 
providing electrical activation of motors or actuators 
in the door by an electric power source on the vehicle 
body provides an opportunity for generating a signal 
on the vehicle body when those contacts close. The present invention can provide such a 
door contact closure signal at minimal cost by 
modifying the existing circuitry on the vehicle body. The invention relates to a vehicle comprising a body 
and having a door movable between open and closed 
positions, an electric power source on the vehicle 
body having first and second terminals, first and 
second body contact means disposed in predetermined spatial 
relationship on the body, with the second body contact 
means being connected to the second terminal of the 
electric power source, and first and
