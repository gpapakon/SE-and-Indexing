<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYPROPYLENE RESINS AND PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOFField of the Invention The present invention relates to the process for the gas—phase or slurry—phase production of polypropylene that is generally useful for oriented film and molded articles. The present invention further relates to film forming and molding processes using the polypropylene and articles produced thereby.Background of the InventionA wide variety of polypropylene, both crystalline and amorphous, are commercially available. Economical processes for the production of polypropylene generally use gas-phase fluidized-bed and slurry—phase technology. The slurry—phase process is run in liquid propylene or another inert diluent whereas the gas—phase process is run in the absence of solvent/diluent which eliminates the need for costly solvent removal. The use of high- activity catalyst in both processes can result in polypropylene with low levels of catalyst residue which eliminates the need for costly catalyst removal. Unfortunately, prior to the present invention, polypropylene produced according to these technologies cannot be used in certain film applications. Since film is an extremely valuable product and both gas—phase and slurry—phase technology using the high—activity catalyst is an important method for producing most polypropylene; it would be very desirable to be able to produce, by gas—phase or slurry phase technology, polypropylene which could be economically converted into more film applications such as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) . 

 Radiation sterilization is a method commonly used in medical applications. In addition, radiation sterilization is being used for numerous food packaging applications. Thus any polypropylene used in these applications must be radiation resistant. However, polypropylene produced using the high—activity catalyst in both gas—phase and slurry—phase processes is susceptible to degradation as initiated by high energy radiation, e.g., gamma rays. For this reason the polypropylene can not be used in applications in which high energy radiation is used. It would, therefore, be very desirable to be able to produce radiation resistant articles from polypropylene produced by gas—phase or slurry—phase technology. This is particularly true if the gas phase or slurry—phase produced polypropylene has properties comparable to polypropylene produced by prior methods (e.g., solution process) but yet is more economical by using the high—activity catalyst.Summary of the InventionThe composition of the
