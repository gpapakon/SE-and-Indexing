<ABSTRACT>
Clinical symptoms of elevated levels of the cytokine interleukin-1 including debilitation, lethargy, loss of intellectual acuity, impaired overall performance, and general inability to care for one's self are significantly ameliorated by the dsRNA which neutralizes the untoward effects of IL-1.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF NEUTRALIZING IL-1 USING dsRNAsDescribed are methods of neutralizing the adverse effects of the cytokine IL-1 and like proteins and related pathogenic materials. IL-1 neutralization is evidenced by the improvement or return to normal of the patient's immune system and/or improvement in the patient's clinical condition in terms of symptomology characteristic of elevated levels of IL-1.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONInterleukin-l (IL-1) is the term for two polypeptides (IL-lo and IL-1B) that possess a wide spectrum of inflammatory, metabolic, physiologic, hematopoietic and immunologic properties. Although both forms of Il-l are distinct gene products, they recognize the same cell surface receptors and share the various biologic activities. In general, significant amounts of IL-1 are not observed in health in most individuals. However, there is a dramatic increase in IL-1 production, and hence blood level, by a variety of cells in response to stimuli including infection, microbial toxins notably retroviruses and human herpes virus, 

 inflammatory agents, products of activated lymphocytes, complement, and clotting components. Elevated IL-1 production has been reported in the following various human disease states:Rheumatoid arthritisRheumatoid arthritis(synovial lining cells)HIV infection and AIDSBacterial infectionRespiratory distress syndrome (alveolar macrophages) Smokers (alveolar macrophages)Coal miner pneumoconiosis (alveolar macrophages) Alcoholic cirrhosis Cuprophane hemodialysiε Cardiopulmonary bypass Chronic hepatitis BThermal injury (burn) Reticulohistiocytosis Sarcoidosis; tuberculosis Obstructive jaundice Pagets'ε disease and osteomalacia Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (newly diagnosed) Kawasaki's disease Inflammatory bowel disease (mucosal mononuclear cells) Luteal phase; strenuous exercise (1,2) 

 The production and biologic activities of IL-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases. IL-1 contributes to pathogenesis of a variety of diseases by virtue of a range of biological functions. The reported biological effects of IL-1 includeT cell activationIL-2 release NK activationNeutiophiliaNeuro peptide release Eosinophil degranulationHypotension, shock, death Beta islet cell toxicityHyperlipidemia Synthesis of collagenase and collagen and osteoblast activationSynovial cell activationSystemic symptoms include fever, myalgia, headache, lassitude and even sleepiness. Other biological effects include fever, chills, rigors, headache, increased muscle proteolysis, nausea,

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of neutralizing the effects of elevated IL-1, comprising administering to a patient having an elevated IL-1 level an effective amount of a dsRNA sufficient to alleviate the patient's clinical symptoms.
2. A method of ameliorating the untoward biological activity of elevated interleukin-l in a patient having diminished ability to perform the activities of daily living as aεεeεsed by the modified Barthel's Activities of Daily Living Index or exhibits chronic debilitation, comprising administering to said patient an effective amount of a dsRNA.
3. A method of modulating the e fect of interleukin-l on divergent and multiple components of the immune system and restoring a patient's ability to raise antibodies against retroviral, herpes virus or other pathogens, said method comprising administering an effective amount of a dsRNA to the patient. 


 4. The method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the patient, prior to treatment, requires assistance for daily care and the dsRNA is administered with the patient's Karnofsky Performance Score increaseε at leaεt 10 units.
5. The method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the patient, prior to treatment, requires considerable assistance for daily care and the dsRNA is administered at least until the patient's modified Barthel'ε Activities of Daily Living Index increaseε at leaεt 10 unitε.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the patient is able to perform independently the routine activities of daily living.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the dsRNA iε a miεmatched dsRNA.
8. The method of claim 7 in which the mismatched dsRNA is a polyadenylic acid co plexed with polyuridylic acid.
