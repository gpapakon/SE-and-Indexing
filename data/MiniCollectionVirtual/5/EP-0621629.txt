<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating an integrated circuit device in a 
semiconductor layer (2) of a first conductivity type includes forming a screen 

insulating layer (17) over the semiconductor layer (2) and implanting an 
impurity through the screen insulating layer (17) into the semiconductor 

layer (2) to form an implanted region (18). The screen insulating layer (17) is 
then removed and the implanted region (18) annealed. The annealing of the 

implanted region (18) after removal of the screen insulating layer (17) results 
in a reduction of residual recrystallization damage in the implanted region 

(18) and, as a result, a reduction in dislocation density in the integrated 
circuit device. The reduction in dislocation density translates into an 

increase in manufacturing yield and an increase in reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and, more 
particularly, to a method for reducing dislocations in integrated circuit 
devices by minimizing recrystallization damage. A problem in the manufacture of integrated circuits is the formation of 
certain defects, commonly referred to as dislocations. There are various types 
of dislocations, but in general, all manifestations are some form of distortion 
of the crystalline lattice. Dislocations have undesired effects on device yield 
and reliability, because they can provide conductive paths that short out 
electrical signals. One source of dislocations arises when a semiconductor material is 
implanted with a high dose implant which creates structural damage in the 
crystalline semiconductor material or even makes the surface region of the 
semiconductor material amorphous. When the damaged region is annealed, 
microscopic dislocations form. If the semiconductor material becomes 
amorphous during implant, it recrystallizes into crystalline material during 
annealing, but some degree of imperfect recrystallization occurs due to 
spatially non-uniform recrystallization regrowth rates. In this case, 
microscopic dislocations are a manifestation of this imperfect 
recrystallization. These microscopic dislocations can propagate into longer dislocations 
under the influence of stress from subsequent device manufacturing steps 
and can then become extended dislocations, traversing distances on the order 
of microns. One type of dislocation, as identified by existing defect analysis, is a 
gate edge dislocation, which is a line that penetrates into a gate region under 
a sidewall spacer. Various techniques have been suggested to prevent this 
type of dislocation. These techniques include fabricating spacers with less 
steep sidewalls and using disposable spacers. However, these techniques 
pose considerable difficulties for manufacturing processes. For example,  
 
disposable spacers cannot be economically used to manufacture salicided 
circuits because the spacer which is removed before source/drain anneal must 
be redeposited after anneal and before silicide reaction to prevent gate to 
active region shorts. Similarly, there is no currently available procedure for 
reducing sidewall spacer slope while controlling sub-micron geometries. Other defect studies have focussed on the relationship between 
implantation techniques and the formation of dislocations. Several studies 
have recognized a relationship between dislocations and implanted
