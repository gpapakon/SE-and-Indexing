<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a process for manufacturing olefin homo- and copolymers having
a bimodal molecular weight distribution. Especially the invention concerns a process for
manufacturing bimodal olefin polymers for film, pipe or blow molding products and
products prepared by the process.Recently high density polyethylene has achieved commercial success in such products as
films, pipes and blow moulding materials. Among these new polymers are high molecular
weight high density polyethylene resins having a broad molecular weight distribution.Polyethylene resins manufactured by using modern high productivity catalysts have often
relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. These resins are not ideal for the
manufacture of high density polyethylene for extrusion, eg. film, pipe or molding resins.Bimodal polyethylenes are polymers, which are composed of low and high molecular
weight fractions. These polymers are designed to have a certain balance between fair
processability and good mechanical strength properties. The low molecular weight
fractions improve the processability properties of the polymer and the high molecular
weight fractions improve mechanical properties. In order to increase strength properties
the proportion of high molecular weight fractions could be increased. The result is,
however, that the product becomes more difficult to process, for example in film extruders.
The processing consumes more energy and the surface quality of the films or pipes
tend to be inferior. In other words the processability of the product sets certain limits to
the proportion of the high molecular weight component. On the other hand the processability
can be improved by using as the first component a polymer having very low molecular
weight.In practise it has been found that in view of product properties the low molecular weight 
component has preferably the following properties: a weight average molecular weight
(Mw) of 5,000-25,000, a ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the
number average molecular weight (Mn) of 2.5-9 and a density of 0.960-0.980 g/cm3 for
bimodal high density polymer and 0.925-0.940 g/cm3 for bimodal low density polymer.
The melt index (MFR2) of this fraction is typically within the range of 10-1000 g/10 min.
The molecular weight of the bimodal end product is between 150,000-400,000, typically
200,000-350,000 and the ratio Mw/Mn is between 20-40. By calculating from these values
or experimentally it is obtained for the high molecular weight component typical Mw-values
of
