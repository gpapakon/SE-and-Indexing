<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer two-dimensional array (44) of 
ultrasonic transducer elements (10) includes four via 

segments (26, 28, 30 and 46) at the four corners of each 
transducer element. A first pair of diagonally opposed 

via segments (26 and 28) provide signals to signal electrode 
layers (22 and 24) of each transducer element. 

A second pair of diagonally opposed via segments (30 and 
46) interconnect ground electrode layers (18 and 20). 

Thus, a redundant interconnection scheme is achieved. If 
the transducer elements include piezoelectric layers having 

a square cross section parallel to a transducer radiating 
surface, four-fold symmetry is maintained, despite 

the formation of the four via segments. Also disclosed 
is a method of forming a two-dimensional array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
transducer devices and more particularly to approaches 
to achieving electrical connections to individual 
multilayer transducer elements in a two-dimensional 
array of elements. A diagnostic ultrasonic imaging system for 
medical use may be utilized to form images of tissues of 
a human body by electrically exciting an acoustic transducer 
element or an array of acoustic transducer elements 
to generate short ultrasonic pulses that are caused to 
travel into the body. Echoes from the tissues are 
received by the ultrasonic transducer element or elements 
and are converted into electrical signals. The electrical 
signals are amplified and used to form a cross sectional 
image of the tissues. Echographic examination is 
also employed outside of the medical field. A linear array of transducer elements may be 
used for echographic examinations, but a two-dimensional 
array is superior in many applications. For example, a 
two-dimensional array can be focused electronically, so 
that the array can be fixed in one position during the 
examination process. Electronic focusing is achieved by 
delaying signals to selected transducer elements in the 
array. The phase correction improves resolution. An area of concern in the fabrication of two-dimensional 
arrays of transducer elements is the method 
of achieving electrical interconnections to transducer 
elements that are not exposed at the sides of the array.  
 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,825,115 to Kawabe et al. describes a 
method of providing excitation energy to a center column 
of elements. Bonding wires may be attached to center 
elements, whereafter a backing layer is formed using 
molding techniques. As noted in the patent, the difficulty 
with this interconnection scheme is that as the 
distance between the transducer elements is reduced in 
order to improve resolution, the potential of two bonding 
wires shorting together is increased. Kawabe et al. 
teaches that a preferred interconnection scheme is one 
that uses L-shaped printed wiring boards having first 
legs that contact the transducer elements and having 
second legs that extend rearwardly along the spacing 
between adjacent columns of elements. The backing layer 
is molded between the second legs of the L-shaped printed 
wiring boards. While Kawabe et al. provides a significant 
improvement over prior interconnection schemes, the 
first legs of the printed circuit board remain in contact 
with the transducer elements, so as to provide a surface 
for reflecting
