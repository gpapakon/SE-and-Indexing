A continuous multi-component slurrying process at 
an oil or gas well comprises fl
owing at least three separate 
streams of different essential materials e.g. a dilution 

fluid, a drilling fluid and a cementitious substance. 
directly into a mixing unit at the oil or gas well, wherein 

each of the essential materials is required to obtain a 
predetermined defining characteristic of the slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an at least 
three primary stream continuous multi-component slurrying 
process at an oil or gas well. In a particular aspect, the 
invention is a process for providing and mixing continuous 
properly proportioned flows of multiple essential materials 
and multiple additives to produce cementitious slurries or 
drilling fluids. A "cementitious slurry" as the expression is used 
herein encompasses mixtures that are made at an oil or gas 
well in a fluid state so that they can be pumped into the 
well but which ultimately harden in the well to provide 
sealing and compressive strength properties useful for known 
purposes in the well. For example, a settable mud is one 
type of cementitious slurry, and a cement is another type of 
cementitious slurry. When a cementitious slurry is needed, a qualified 
person analyses the particular situation and designs a 
particular slurry. Such a design includes a list of 
ingredients (the "recipe") and possibly one or more desired 
parameters (e.g. density). Such a design has at least one 
of what is referred to herein as a "defining 
characteristic". For a settable mud, a defining 
characteristic is the recipe of ingredients. For a cement, 
a defining characteristic is density. The design is implemented at the well by mixing 
the ingredients in a manner to obtain the one or more 
defining  
 
characteristics. The ingredients that are mixed can be of two 
types: essential materials and additives. As used in this 
description and the accompanying claims defining the present 
invention, "essential materials" are ingredients that are 
required to obtain a particular defining characteristic of a 
slurry; "additives" are ingredients that modify or enhance the 
defining or other characteristics of the slurry. Any 
particular slurry will always have essential materials, but it 
may or may not have additives. For the slurries and fluids to which the present 
invention is directed, there are always at least three 
essential materials for obtaining a defining characteristic. 
For example, a defining characteristic of a cement slurry is 
density; three essential materials for obtaining this 
characteristic are a hydrating fluid (e.g., fresh water, 
seawater, brine), a cementitious substance (e.g., cement), and 
a density control agent (e.g., fly ash). As a further 
example, a defining characteristic of a drilling fluid is also 
density; three essential materials for obtaining a desired 
density in a drilling fluid are a fluid medium (e.g.,

A process for continuously mixing a settable mud 
at an oil or gas well, which process comprises; 


(a) flowing a dilution fluid directly into a 
mixing unit at the oil or gas well; 
(b) flowing a drilling fluid directly into the 
mixing unit; 
(c) flowing a cementitious substance directly into 
the mixing unit; and 
(d) mixing the dilution fluid, the drilling fluid 
and the cementitious substance in the mixing unit. 
A process according to claim 1, which further 
comprises, before said steps (a), (b), (c) and (d) : flowing 

a fluid medium into the mixing unit; flowing a viscosity 

control agent into the mixing unit; flowing a density 
control agent into the mixing unit; mixing the fluid medium, 

the viscosity control agent and the density control agent in 
the mixing unit into a drilling fluid to be pumped into the 

well; pumping the drilling fluid of the preceding step into 
the well; and returning at least a portion of the pumped 

drilling fluid from the well and flowing the returned 
portion into a storage facility; and wherein said step (b) 

includes using at least a portion of the drilling fluid from 
the storage facility. 
A process according to claim 2, wherein using at 
least a portion of the drilling fluid from the storage 

facility includes conditioning at least a portion of the 
drilling fluid from the storage facility without 

substantially increasing the volume of the conditioned 
portion, and pumping the conditioned portion into the mixing 

unit. 
A continuous multi-component slurrying process at 
an oil or gas well, which process comprises continuously 

flowing at least four streams of differing compositions into 
an inlet mixer and through the inlet mixer into an averaging 

tub to define a mixture in the tub, wherein the at least 
four streams of differing compositions include at least one 

stream having an essential dry material, at least one stream 
having an essential liquid material, at least one stream 

having another essential material, and at least one stream 
including a portion of the mixture recirculated from the tub 

through the inlet mixer. 
A process according to claim 4, further comprising 
continuously flowing an additive into the portion of the 

mixture recirculated from the tub through the inlet mixer. 
A process according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the 
inlet mixer includes at least one axial flow mixer. 
A continuous multi-component cementitious 
slurrying process at an oil or gas well, which process 

comprises continuously flowing into an inlet mixer a first 
stream including a fluid; continuously flowing into the 

inlet mixer a second stream including a dry cementitious 
substance; continuously flowing into the inlet mixer a third 

stream including another material; continuously adding into 
at least one of the first, second and third streams at least 

one additive; and continuously mixing the first, second and 
third streams in the inlet mixer without stopping the flow 

of the streams through the inlet mixer and flowing the mixed 
streams into a tub and further mixing the mixed streams in 

the tub into a cementitious slurry. 
A process according to claim 7, wherein the inlet 
mixer includes at least one axial flow mixer. 
A process according to claim 7 or 8, further

mixer a fourth stream including a portion of the
