<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a topical composition
comprising zinc oxide particularly, but not exclusively for
impregnating a bandage.Bandages impregnated with pastes containing zinc oxide
are commonly used for the treatment of skin complaints such
as leg ulcers, varicose eczemas and chronic determatitis.
These known pastes are not sufficiently emulsified and are
therefore unstable, particularly when subjected to
sterilization processes such as heating and irradiation. As
these known pastes cannot be properly sterilized it is
conventional to include "preservatives" which include
antibacterial agents, such as alkyl p-hydroxybenzoates, in
order to irradicate any bacteria that are not eliminated by
other sterilization techniques. These preservatives cause
hyposensitivity when the bandage comprising the paste is
applied to the wound.EP-A-0040378 discloses sterilizable mixtures containing
zinc oxide, celluloseether, glycerin, water and up to 5% of
further additives.FR-A-2649318 discloses pre-emulsions for dermatological
or cosmetic use, which may comprise zinc oxide and which do
not comprise a preservative agent.The present invention seeks to provide alternative
sterilization stable topical compositions.According to the present invention there is provided
a topical composition for impregnating a bandage comprising 
zinc oxide in a stable emulsion comprising from 0.2 to 16%
wt of at least one fat and/or oil, at least one emulsifying
agent, at least one inorganic suspending agent, xanthan gum
and water, in the absence of a preservative.The stable emulsions of the compositions of the present
invention eliminate the need for a preservative. Thus topical 
zinc oxide containing compositions can be made which do not
suffer from the drawback of sensitivity.The compositions of the invention are primarily intended
for impregnating bandages for use in the treatment of skin
diseases.The zinc oxide is the active agent. The composition
preferably comprises from 0.5% to 40.0% wt of zinc oxide and
more preferably substantially 15% wt of zinc oxide. The
composition may comprise additional active ingredients such
as calamine, icthammol, clioquinol and coal tar. The
composition preferably comprises from 0 to 40% wt of
additional actives.In a preferred embodiment of the invention the fats
and/or oils comprise fractionated coconut oil and/or synthetic
spermacetti, combinations of cetyl alcohol; stearyl alcohol;
other alcohols (C8 to C24); triglyceride oils or fats; esters
such as cetyl palmitate, myristyl myristate; liquid and
