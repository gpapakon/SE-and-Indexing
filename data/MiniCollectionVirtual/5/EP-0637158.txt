<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a stand-alone telephone answering 
system 8 constructed in a single integral unit with a telephone line interface 

20 to a telecommunications network. The telephone answering system 8 
further comprises a recording and playback system 16 and a message storage 

memory 18, coupled to the recording and playback system 16. A controller 10 
is operable to control the operation of the stand-alone telephone answering 

system 8. The user interacts with the stand-alone telephone answering 
system 8 through a display 26 and a data input device 24 coupled to the 

controller 10. The controller 10 controls operation of the stand-alone 
telephone answering system 8 based upon caller identification information 

stored in a caller directory memory 12 coupled to the controller 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications 
devices, and more particularly to an improved stand-alone telephone 
answering system and method for operating the same. The telephone provides the primary form of communication for 
individuals and businesses today. As society becomes more mobile and 
individuals are less often at home or their office, the telephone becomes a less 
effective way of communicating. Today, individuals and businesses use 
telephone answering machines to overcome this problem. These machines 
answer the telephone and allow a caller to leave a message that a user can 
play back later. Original answering machines recorded and stored messages on analog 
tape. Although a convenient method for recording messages, analog 
answering machines lack flexibility and contain little built-in intelligence. 
Messages can only be played back in the order received and individual 
messages cannot be easily saved or forwarded. The use of digital technology in answering machines provides a more 
flexible device with an opportunity to build more intelligence into the system. 
Some digital answering machines take advantage of digital voice algorithms, 
but fail to take advantage of digital technology to implement features such as 
message forwarding, message broadcasting, or message prioritizing. Large 
voice mail systems and paging systems do implement some of these features.  
 
However, these systems are typically large computer or PC-based systems 
that are expensive and inconvenient for consumers to purchase and use. Therefore, a need has arisen to provide a small, low-cost, stand-alone 
answering machine that provides features of larger voice mail systems. 
Specifically, a need has arisen for a low-cost, stand-alone answering machine 
that provides consumers with features such as message forwarding, message 
broadcasting, and message prioritization. In accordance with the present invention, a telephone answering 
system is provided which substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages 
and problems associated with prior telephone answering machines. The 
telephone answering system includes an interface to the telecommunications 
network. Messages are recorded and stored in digital format in a message 
storage memory. A playback system reads the digital data from the message 
storage memory and plays back the message. A controller is configured to 
control the overall operation of the answering machine. A display and data 
input device are coupled to the controller and

<CLAIMS>
A telephone answering system in a single integral unit operable in 
conjunction with a telecommunications network, comprising: 

a telephone line interface; 
a recording and playback system coupled to said telephone line 

interface; 
a message storage memory coupled to said recording and playback 

system; 
a controller operable to control operation of the stand-alone telephone 

answering system; 
a display coupled to said controller; 

a data input device coupled to said controller; and 
a caller directory memory coupled to said controller containing caller 

identification information. 
The answering system of claim 1, operable to receive caller 
identification information through said telephone line interface and to 

selectively transmit messages to another location through the 
telecommunications network responsive to said caller identification 

information. 
The answering system of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a 
sensor coupled to said controller, the answering system selectively 

transmitting a message stored in said message storage memory upon a 
signal from said sensor. 
The answering system of claim 3, wherein the sensor comprises a 
temperature sensor, the answering system selectively transmitting the 

 
message stored in said message storage memory upon said 

temperature sensor detecting the occurrence of a predetermined event. 
The answering system of claim 3, wherein the sensor comprises an 
alarm sensor said controller selectively transmitting the message 

stored in said message storage memory upon said alarm sensor 
detecting the occurrence of a predetermined event. 
The answering system of any preceding claim, wherein the system 
selectively transmits a message stored in said message storage 

memory when said message storage memory is storing a 
predetermined number of messages. 
The answering system of any preceding claim and being operable to 
allow access to a mailbox in said message storage memory based upon 

caller identification information received. 
The answering system of any preceding claim, and being operable to 
playback messages in a priority order based upon caller identification 

information.
