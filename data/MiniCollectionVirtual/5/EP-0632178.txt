<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle door lock (1) including a fork and latch 
closing mechanism (3); an external opening control lever 

(5); a safety control lever (8) movable between a first 
stable position preventing opening from the outside, and 

a second stable position enabling opening from the 
outside; an internal opening control lever (6) movable 

between a first idle position (
a
) and a second position 
(
b
) wherein it interacts with a pin (15) of the latch to 
open the lock (1); and articulated connecting means (21) 

between the safety control lever (8) and the internal 
opening control lever (6), for moving the safety control 

lever (8) between the first and second stable position 
when the internal opening control lever (6) is moved 

from the idle position (
a
) to a third intermediate 
position (
c
) of its travel, and vice versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle door
lock.Locks are known comprising a fork and latch
closing mechanism; an external opening control lever
connected to the outside door handle; a safety control
lever for enabling or disabling opening of the door from
the outside; and an internal opening control lever
connected to the inside door handle.The safety control lever of such locks is normally
connected to a safety knob inside the passenger
compartment and movable between a depressed or recessed
position and a raised or visible position respectively
corresponding to engagement and release of the safety
mechanism. In addition to controlling the safety
mechanism, the safety knob therefore also provides for
indicating the state of the lock (safety mechanism
engaged or released).The internal opening control lever of known locks
normally presents a cam surface cooperating with a
corresponding surface on the safety control lever for 
moving this from the engaged to the released position
during a first portion of the travel of the inside
handle, and so moving the safety knob from the depressed
to the raised position. As the inside handle is moved
further into the limit position, the internal opening
control lever is brought into contact with the latch
which, when moved, releases the fork to open the lock.Conventional locks therefore present two
in-vehicle control elements (handle and knob) with
partially overlapping functions, particularly as regards
release of the safety mechanism, whereas, for obvious
production and assembly cost reasons, all the manual
control functions would be better performed by a single
element.To some extent - see European Patent n. 0169644 -
the above problem has been solved by connecting both the
safety control lever and the internal opening control
lever to the inside handle using a single Bowden cable.GB-A-2 259 734 discloses a vehicle door latch system in which both the safety control lever and the opening control lever are actuated by the inside handle through a rod linked to such levers by a lost motion mechanism.
The complications involved in such known solutions, however,
fail to provide for entirely eliminating the above
drawbacks.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a straightforward, reliable, low-cost vehicle
door lock designed to overcome the above drawbacks, and
whereby, in particular, all the in-vehicle manual
control functions are performed solely by the inside
handle, the position of which indicates the state of the
lock. According to the present

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle door lock (1) comprising a fork and
latch closing mechanism (3); an external opening control

lever (5) connected to the outside door handle; a safety
control lever (8) movable between a first stable

position preventing opening from the outside, and a
second stable position enabling opening from the

outside; and an internal opening control lever (6)
connected to the inside door handle (7) and traveling

between a first idle position (
a
) and a second position
(
b
) wherein it interacts with a pin (15) of said latch
to open the lock (1); characterized in that it comprises

articulated connecting means (21) between said safety
control lever (8) and said internal opening control

lever (6), for moving said safety control lever (8)
between said first and second stable positions when the

internal opening control lever (6) is moved from the
idle position (
a
) to a third intermediate position (
c
)
of its travel, and vice versa.
A lock (1) as claimed in Claim 1, characterized
in that said first and second positions of said safety

control lever (8) are maintained stable by a spring
(24); said third position (
c
) of said internal opening
control lever (6) being maintained stable by said spring

(24) via said articulated connecting means (21).
A lock (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that said articulated connecting means 

(21) comprise a connecting rod connected to respective
arms (20, 19) of said safety control lever (8) and said

internal opening control lever (6) via hinge means (23,
22).
A lock (1) as claimed in Claim 3, characterized
in that said hinge means (23, 22) comprise at least a

sliding connection (28) disconnecting said internal
opening control lever (6) from said safety control lever

(8) during a portion of travel extending between said
third (
c
) and said second (
b
) position.
A lock (1) as claimed in one of the foregoing
Claims from 2 to 4, characterized in that said handle

(7) is connected to said internal opening control lever
(6) by a rigid rod (16); said handle (7) being movable

between an idle position (
A
) and an opening position (
B
)
corresponding respectively to said first (
a
) and second
(
b
) positions of said internal opening control lever
(6); and said handle (7) presenting a third intermediate

stable position (
C
) corresponding to said third position
(
c
) of said internal opening control lever (6).
A lock (1) as claimed in any one of the
foregoing Claims, characterized in that it comprises a

safety knob (26) connected to said safety control lever
(8) and movable between a depressed position and a

raised position respectively corresponding to said first
and second positions of said safety control lever (8).
