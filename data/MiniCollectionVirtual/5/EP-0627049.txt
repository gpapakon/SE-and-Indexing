<ABSTRACT>
An angular ball bearing capable of bearing in both axial directions has ball rings (4, 5) mutually offset in the axial direction, a single-piece outer running ring (1) and two inner running rings (2, 3) whose front faces lie against each other. Running grooves (4a, 5a, 4b, 5b) are designed in the shoulders of the inner running rings (2, 3) and of the outer running ring (1). This angular ball bearing is characterized in that at least two ball rings are associated (5, 6) to at least one of the two inner running rings (2, 3). The diameter of the ball rings gradually increases from a parting plane (8) of the front faces of the inner running rings (2, 3). This measure allows the bearing capacity to be substantially increased whereas the space required is only slightly increased.

<CLAIMS>
An angular ball bearing capable of being loaded in both axial directions 
comprising ball rings (4, 10, 11, 5, 6, 12) axially offset with respect to one 

another, an outer race ring (1) and an inner race ring (2, 3), one of these rings 
being composed of two ring parts (2, 3) with end faces bearing against each 

other and the diameter of the ball rings (4, 10, 11, 5, 6, 12) increases or 
decreases in steps starting from a separating plane (8) at the end faces of the ring 

composed of two ring parts, 
characterized in that
 balls of the ball rings (4, 10, 
11, 5, 6, 12) are arranged in prong-type or snap cages (7), and one ring part of 

each cage (7) extending outside of the peripheral extent of the balls (11, 10, 12, 
6) is arranged radially of the outer periphery of the respective adjacent ball ring 

(10, 4, 6, 5) of smaller diameter while partially overlapping this ball ring in axial 
direction.
