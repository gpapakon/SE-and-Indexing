<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a slightly alkaline automatic dishwashing detergent containing an oxygen-based bleach and further conventional ingredients, which is characterised in that it contains a combination of     a) one or more activators and   b) one or more encapsulated additives, which ensures that the bleach content of the washing liquor is essentially completely decomposed at the end of the cleaning cycle in the alkaline medium.

<CLAIMS>
Mildly alkaline dishwasher detergent containing an
oxygen-based bleaching agent and also other conventional

constituents, characterised in that it contains a
combination of


a) one or more activators and
b) one or more encapsulated addition agents that in
combination with the activator bring about elimination of

the oxygen content at the end of the cleaning phase,

which combination ensures that at the end of the cleaning
phase in the alkaline environment the bleaching-agent

content of the rinsing liquor is substantially totally
eliminated.
Dishwasher detergent according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the addition agent is an encapsulated

oxygen-decomposing enzyme.
Dishwasher detergent according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the addition agent is an encapsulated

reducing agent.
Dishwasher detergent according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the addition agent is an encapsulated

heavy metal or compound thereof that is capable of
decomposing the bleaching agent catalytically.
Dishwasher detergent according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that TAED, TAGU, GPA, NOBS, DPDDA,

PAG, DADHT or ISA is employed by way of activator.
Dishwasher detergent according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that sodium perborate, sodium

percarbonate and/or potassium monopersulfate or stabilised
grades of these substa
nces are employed by way of bleaching
agent. 
Dishwasher detergent according to Claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that the activator is TAED and is present

in a molar ratio relative to the bleaching agent of over
0.5:1, preferably of at least 0.65:1.
Dishwasher detergent according to Claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that the activator is TAED and is present

in a weight ratio relative to sodium perborate monohydrate
by way of bleaching agent of at least 1.14:1, preferably at

least 1.5:1.
Dishwasher detergent according to Claim 4,
characterised in that the heavy metal is copper, iron,

manganese, zinc or titanium.
