<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a stabilizer composition 
enabling the production of a pourable aerated dairy 

dessert having a shelf-life of at least three weeks 
without significant sagging or demixing, characterized in 

that it comprises 10 to 30 % by weight of guar gum, 5 to 
20 % by weight of carrageenan and/or xanthan gum and 60 to 

80 % by weight of an emulsifier selected from mono- and 
diglycerides of fatty acids, lactic or citric acid esters 

of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, sorbitan mono- or 
tristearate and lecithins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a stabilizer
composition for preparing an aerated
dairy dessert.More exactly, this invention is related to a
dessert in the form of a pourable mousse, although stable
for a few weeks, which is preferably consumed cold, at the
temperature of the refrigerator, but not frozen.Shaken ice milks are known, namely of the milkshake
type, which are beverages with overrun and are
consumed iced, at slightly negative (CÂ°) temperatures.
These drinks are prepared either traditionally by crushing
and whipping ice cream in milk, or industrially by means
of a machine which aerates and cools such a mixture
optionally added with flavours and gelling and thickening
agents such as carrageenan. However these are liquid
desserts, having a relatively low overrun (30 to 70 %) and
above all they are little stable in time.US 4 959 227 pertains to a balanced liquid meal comprising from 70 to
90% by weight of skim milk. Such meals am for instance complete liquid milk ice
cream, yogurt, cottage, cheese, butter milk milkshakes, soft serves, ice milk,
sherbert which all have a low overrun ranging from 30 to 70%.
A stabiliser containing 60% mono- & diglycercides, carboxymethylcellulose, guar gum,
locust bean and carrageenan has been used in a low fat shake base.On the other hand there are known milk-based
mousses, namely whipped cream, bavarois and industrial
chocolate mousses, which have high overrun, but are
essentially solid and consequently cannot be poured.The object of the present invention, is to provide a process enabling the
preparation of an aerated dairy dessert, having high overrun while being
pourable and stable.More precisely, the subject matter of the invention is the use of a
stabilizer composition comprising: 
10 to 30% by weight of guar gum;5 to 20% by weight of carrageenan and/or
xanthan gum; and60 to 80% by weight of an emulsifier selected
from mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, lactic
or citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty
acids, sorbitan mono- or tristearate and lecithins,
for the production of a pourable aerated dairy dessert
in the form of a foam, having an overrun of 75 to 150%
and a shelf life of at least three weeks without significant
sagging or demixing, it being understood that
the overrun is given by the following formula :
OR = W1 - W2W2 x 100
in which W1 is the weight of a volume of unwhipped dessert
and W2 is the weight of the same volume of whipped
dessert.The guar gum, obtained by extracting ground guar
seeds, is that generally used in
