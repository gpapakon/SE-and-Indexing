<ABSTRACT>
The cloning of the heparinase gene from Flavobacterium Heparinum using the polymerase chain reaction is described. The Open Reading Frame (ORF) corresponded to 1152 base pairs encoding a precursor protein of MW 43,800 daltons. The amino acid sequence reveals a 20-residue leader peptide. The gene was expressed in two expression systems in E. Coli.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally in the area of 
heparinases and is specifically directed to the gene 
encoding heparinase I, expressed in Flavobacterium 
heparinum. The United States government has rights in this 
invention by virtue of grant number 25810 from the 
National Institutes of Health. Heparin is an anticoagulant that activates 
serine protease inhibitors (serpins), which play a key 
role in the blood clotting cascade, as described by 
Damus et al., Nature 246:355-357 (1973). According to 
Lindahl et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:221-225 
(1986), heparin is the most acidic natural polymer 
known to date. It consists of a major 1,4-linked 
disaccharide repeating unit of D-uronic acid 
1,4-Î²-D-glucosamine, and has an average of four 
negative charges (three sulfate groups and one 
carboxylate group) per monosaccharide unit. Heparin 
is both polydisperse, having an average molecular 
weight between 3,000 and 45,000 daltons, and 
heterogenous due to partial epimerization of 
D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid and incomplete N-and 
0- sulfation, as reported by Kusche et al., Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci., 77:6551-6555 (1980) and Comper, 
Polymer Monograph 7, 1981. In addition, proteoglycans like heparin have a 
wide range of biological influences, including in 
blood chemistry, growth factor interaction and wound 
healing, interaction with basic structural proteins in 
the extracellular matrix and in cellular mediated 
immune responses. The basic nature of protein/peptide 
heparin/complex carbohydrate interaction is important. 
Although heparin seems fairly heterogenous, it is now 
quite clear that different heparin fractions exhibit 
distinct and unique properties indicating some  
 
compositional and possibly structural specificity for 
its biological role, as reviewed by Cardin, A. D. and 
H. J. R. Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9, 21-32 (1989). Heparinase, also referred to as heparin lyase, 
is the only known enzyme capable of degrading heparin 
that has been extensively characterized. It has been 
designated EC 4.2.2.7 by the Enzyme Commission. 
According to Galliher, et al., Eur. J. Appl. 
Microbiol. 15:252 (1982), the enzyme is a 
polysaccharide lyase found in the periplasmic space of 
Flavobacterium heparinum, a Gram-negative soil 
isolate. F. heparinum utilizes heparin as its sole 
source of carbon and nitrogen, as described by Hoving 
and Linker, J. Biol. Chem. 245:6170 (1970). 
Heparinase is the initial enzyme of heparin 
catabolism. Although constitutively expressed in low 
amounts, Galliher, et
