<ABSTRACT>
This ski comprises longitudinal reinforcing elements (7) which, each bearing on an edge (6) and forming the side walls of the ski, serve for supporting and fastening the sides of the shell (8), the height of the reinforcing elements (7) being substantially equal, in at least one zone of the ski, to the height of the latter, whilst, in at least one other zone of the ski, the height of the reinforcing elements (7) is less than the height of the ski, and the shell (8) has at least one part (12) which slopes downwards and outwards.

Ski comprising narrow sides and an upper shell, 
comprising a filling core, for example made of polyurethane 

foam, and a lower face equipped with a central 
sliding sole and delimited by two longitudinal metal 

edges, as well as reinforcement and decoration sheets, 
characterized in that it comprises longitudinal 

reinforcement elements which, each being supported on an 
edge and forming the narrow sides of the ski, serve for 

the support and the fixing of the sides of the shell, the 
height of the reinforcement elements being essentially 

equal, in at least one zone of the ski, to the height of 
the latter while, in at least one other zone of the ski, 

the height of the reinforcement elements is smaller than 
the height of the ski, and the shell has at least one 

part which is inclined from the top to the bottom and 
from the inside towards the outside. 
Ski according to Claim 1, characterized in that, 
in the central zone, the height of at least one reinforcement 

element is smaller than the height of the ski, 
the shell having at least one corresponding inclined part 

while, in at least one of the end zones, the height of at 
least one reinforcement element is essentially equal to 

the height of the ski. 
Ski according to Claim 1, characterized in that, 
in the central zone, the height of at least one 

reinforcement element is essentially equal to the height 
of the ski while, in at least one of the end zones, the 

height of at least one reinforcement element is smaller 
than the height of the ski, the shell having at least one 

corresponding inclined part.  
 
Ski according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that its two reinforcement elements 

which form narrow sides are symmetrical in relation to 
its longitudinal median plane. 
Ski according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that its two reinforcement elements 

which form narrow sides are unsymmetrical in relation to 
its longitudinal median plane. 
Ski according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that each inclined part of the shell 

ends, towards the bottom, in a return which is parallel 
to the plane of the sole and is supported on the upper 

face of a reinforcement element which forms a narrow 
side. 
Ski according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
char
acterized in that the external surfaces of the 
reinforcement elements are inclined in relation to the 

perpendicular to the plane of the sole at an angle which 
is constant or variable over the length of the ski. 
Ski according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the upper reinforcement fabric of 

the shell is constituted by unidirectional fibres 
oriented in the longitudinal direction of the ski.
