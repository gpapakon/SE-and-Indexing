<ABSTRACT>
A water-based agent suitable for treating copper or copper 
alloys on printed wiring boards (PWB) is provided. The 

chemical layer formed on the PWB shows excellent heat-resistance 
and moisture-resistance. Therefore, the treated 

PWB preserves excellent solderability for a long time. The 
water-based agent comprises, as an active ingredient, a 

2-arylimidazole of formula (I) 

wherein n is 0 or 1; R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; 
R¹ and R², which may be the same or different, are hydrogen 

atoms, lower alkyl groups or halogen atoms; and R³ and R⁴, 
which may be the same or different, are hydrogen atoms, lower 

alkyl groups, halogen atoms, lower alkoxy groups, di-lower 
alkylamino groups, cyano groups or nitro groups;

 
   with the proviso that when n is 1, R and R¹-R⁴ may not 

all be hydrogen atoms;
 

   for treating a copper or copper alloy surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water-based 
surface treating agent that forms a chemical layer on 
the surfaces of copper and copper alloys and is suited 
for use as a preflux for copper circuit on rigid printed 
wiring boards and on flexible printed wiring boards. Surface treatment methods of forming a chemical 
layer of an alkylimidazole compound having a long-chain 
alkyl group at the 2-position on the surfaces of copper 
or copper alloys have been disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Publications Nos. 17046/1971, 11454/1973, 25621/1973, 
1983/1974, 26183/1974, 22545/1983, 41988/1986 and in 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 90492/1986. Surface treatment methods of forming a chemical 
layer of an imidazole compound substituted with an aryl 
group at the 2-position on the surfaces of copper or copper 
alloys have been disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publications Nos. 202780/1992 and 206681/1992. As for the surface treatment methods of forming a 
chemical layer of a benzimidazole-type compound on the 
surfaces of copper or copper alloys, a surface treatment 
method using a 5-methylbenzimidazole has been disclosed 
in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 501281/1983, 
and surface treatment methods using a 
2-alkylbenzimidazole compound, a 2-arylbenzimidazole 
compound, a 2-aralkylbenzimidazole compound and a 2-mercaptoalkylbenzimidazole 
compound have been disclosed 
in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications Nos. 
124395/1991, 236478/1991, 72072/1992, 80375/1982, 
99285/1992, 157174/1992, 165083/1992, 173983/1992,  
 
183874/1992, 202780/1992, 206681/1992, 218679/1992, 
25407/1993, 93280/1993, 93281/1993, 156475/1993, 
163585/1993, 175643/1993, 186880/1993, 186888/1993, 
202492/1993, 230674/1993, 237688/1993, 263275/1993, 
287562/1993, 291729/1993, 287563/1993 and 291729/1993. Furthermore, methods of preventing copper or copper 
alloys from rusting by using a 2-mercaptobenzimidazole 
have been disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publications Nos. 83157/1980, 77600/1987 and 
118598/1988. In recent years, surface mount device (SMD) have in 
many cases been mounted on the surfaces of the printed 
wiring boards (PWBs). Therefore, the PWBs are 
frequently subjected to high temperatures from such 
needs as temporary mounting of the SMDs, mounting of the 
SMDs on both surfaces, and mounting of the SMDs and 
discrete parts in a mixed manner. Due to the poor heat-resistance of the imidazole 
compounds having a long-chain alkyl group at the 
2-position, PWSs treated with these imidazole
