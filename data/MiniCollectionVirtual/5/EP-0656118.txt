<ABSTRACT>
A method of monitoring the status of a current ovulation cycle of an individual human female subject, involving repeated testing of the body fluid concentration of at least one analyte of significance in relation to the status of the ovulation cycle, such as urinary E3G, during at least the pre-ovulation phase of the current ovulation cycle of the individual subject, wherein testing for said analyte concentration during the current ovulation cycle is commenced a plurality of days (preferably at least 5) following the onset of menses but at least 2 numerical days in advance of the earlierst numerical day on which actual ovulation has occurred in one or more previous ovulation cycles in the same individual subject.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods, devices and test 
kits for use in monitoring the ovulation cycle in female 
mammals especially humans. The invention is particularly, although not solely 
concerned with the provision of reliable information 
concerning fertility status as an aid to contraception, by 
the use of simple practical procedures that can readily be 
applied by unskilled persons e.g. in the home. An 
important objective of the invention is to provide reliable 
contraceptive advice while avoiding the necessity for tests 
to be conducted on a frequent (eg. daily) basis throughout 
every ovulation cycle. The necessity for regular, e.g. 
daily, testing throughout the cycle has characterised many 
ovulation cycle monitoring systems previously proposed. To provide reliable information concerning fertility 
status, the user must be given adequate warning of the 
onset of the fertile phase in the cycle. In general the 
proposed techniques rely on the monitoring of one or more 
parameters which alter as the event of ovulation 
approaches. Typical parameters which have been invoked are 
the concentration of a body fluid analyte, such as 
estradiol and metabolites thereof, for example estrone-3-glucuronide 
(E3G). Other parameters that have been used 
are basal body temperature and various physiological 
changes such as the characteristics of vaginal mucous. Many excellent academic studies have been carried out 
using such parameters. Such studies have established how 
these parameters can be correlated with the fertility 
status of an average member of a large population sample. However, when attempting to develop a practical 
monitoring system suitable for use by individuals, it is  
 
found that many individual subjects do not conform to the 
average in terms of cycle length and/or the duration and 
timing of the fertile phase. The extent of variation from 
one individual to another, and indeed, from one cycle to 
another in the same individual, renders average population 
data too unreliable for practical use. In the provision of reliable contraceptive advice, it 
is clearly very important that a monitoring method should 
give adequate warning of the onset of a fertile phase which 
happens to occur significantly in advance of normal. In 
this instance "normal" may be defined either in terms of 
population data, or normal for the individual subject 
herself. The tendency has been to exercise extreme caution and 
to require testing of the relevant parameters throughout 
the cycle, and particularly

<CLAIMS>
A method of monitoring the status of a current 
ovulation cycle of an individual mammalian female subject, 

involving repeated testing of the body fluid concentration 
of at least one analyte of significance in relation to the 

status of the ovulation cycle during at least the pre-ovulation 
phase of the current ovulation cycle of the 

individual subject, wherein testing for said analyte 
concentration during the current ovulation cycle is 

commenced a plurality of days following the onset of menses 
but at least 2 numerical days in advance of the earliest 

numerical day on which actual ovulation has occurred in one 
or more previous ovulation cycles in the same individual 

subject. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein testing is 
commenced at least 3 numerical days in advance of the 

earliest numerical day on which actual ovulation has 
occurred in one or more previous ovulation cycles in the 

same individual subject. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein testing is 
commenced at least 4 numerical days in advance of the 

earliest numerical day on which actual ovulation has 
occurred in one or more previous ovulation cycles in the 

same individual subject. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein testing is commenced at least 5 numerical 

days following the onset of menses. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the 
testing is commenced on a numerical day in advance of the 

earliest numerical day on which actual ovulation has 
occurred in one or more previous ovulation cycles in the  

 
same individual subject, said testing commencement day 

being calculated according to the following relationship:

A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the body fluid is urine. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the analyte is estradiol or a metabolite 

thereof, such as E3G. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein 2 or more analytes are tested to provide 

comparative data, such as the concentration ratio of two 
analytes tested simultaneously. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the earliest actual ovulation day is 

derived from data collected during at least 3 consecutive 
previous cycles. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the earliest actual ovulation day is 

derived from data collected during at least 5 consecutive 
previous cycles. 
A method according to any one of the previous 
claims, wherein the earliest ovulation day is derived from 

data obtained during at least the immediately preceding 
cycle.  

 
A method according to claim 11, wherein the 
earliest ovulation day is derived from data obtained from 

a rolling reference base consisting of a fixed number of 
consecutive cycles immediately preceding the current cycle. 
A method according to claim 12, wherein the 
rolling reference base consists of the immediately 

preceding 4 to 10 cycles. 
A method according to claim 12, wherein the 
rolling reference base consists of the immediately 

preceding 5 or 6 cycles. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein actual ovulation day is determined by

A method according to any one of claims 1 to 14, 
wherein actual ovulation is determined by detecting the 

urinary LH surge. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the subject is human.

any one of the preceding claims, comprising one or more 

testing devices for determining the concentration (in 
relative or absolute terms) of said at least one analyte in

derive a precise testing commencement day from knowledge of 

the numerical day on which actual ovulation occurred during 
at least one previous ovulation cycle. 
A test kit according to claim 18, wherein said 
enabling means is electronic.
