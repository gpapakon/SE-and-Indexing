<ABSTRACT>
The casing according to the invention comprises a casing body (1) and a removable lid (2). The casing contains at least one printed circuit board (6), the first end (28) of which is retained by first retention means (27), and the second end (26) of which is engaged under bosses formed on the corresponding face of an intermediate wall (10) fixed substantially perpendicular to the bottom (15) of the casing body (1). The intermediate wall (10) is held by lateral guides of the opposite faces (20, 21) of the casing body (1) and by clip fastening means (33). Thus the printed circuit board (6) is held without the intervention of fixing screws.

Electronic packaging case, comprising a case
body (1) and a removable lid (2) which fits onto the

case body (1) in order to close it, and comprising
means for holding at least one printed-circuit board

(6) in place inside the case, characterized in that the
means for holding the printed-circuit board (6) in

place comprise :

first fitting means (27) in the case body which are
suitable for receiving and holding a first end (28) of

the printed-circuit board (6) so as to prevent the
printed-circuit board (6) from lifting away from the

bottom (15) and from moving longitudinally in a
direction parallel to that of the said first end (28),
an added intermediate wall (10) substantially
perpendicular to the bottom (15) of the case body (1),

retained by lateral guides (16-19) made on two opposed
lateral faces (20, 21) of the case body (1), and

provided on one of its faces (22) with projections (23,
24) suitable for bearing on at least the upper face

(25) of the printed-circuit board (6) at or near its
second end (26) opposite the said first end (28) when

the intermediate wall (10) is put into position in the
case body (1), the intermediate wall (10) also forming

a stop against which the edge of the second end (26) of
the printed-circuit board (6) bears.
Case according to claim 1, characterized in
that the added intermediate wall (10) is held in

position in the case by snap-in means (32-35) made on
the said opposed lateral faces (20, 21) of the case

body (1) and on the corresponding lateral edges (30,
31) of the intermediate wall (10).
Case according to claim 2, characterized in
that the snap-in means comprise :


slots (32, 33) made in the thickness of rabbets (4)
of the case body (1) which are provided for fitting the

lid (2), 
catches (34, 35) projecting from the lateral edges
(30, 31) of the intermediate wall (10) and suitable for

engaging in the slots (32, 33) when the intermediate
wall (10) is in position.
Case according to claim 1, characterized in
that the projections (23, 24) of the intermediate wall

(10) form vertical ribs constituting guiding means for
holding printed-circuit boards, arranged so as to be

perpendicular to the bottom (15) of the case body (1).
Case according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the first fitting means (27)

comprise projections made on an internal face (29) of
the peripheral wall of the case body (1), shaped so as

to bear on at least the upper face (25) of the printed-circuit
board (6) when the latter is in position in the

case body (1).
Case according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the first fitting means (27)

comprise projections made on the internal face (29) of
an added element (39) in the case body (1), shaped so

as to bear on at least the upper face (25) of the
printed-circuit board (6) when the latter is in

position in the case body (1).
Case according to claim 6, characterized in
that the added element (39) forms part of the

peripheral wall of the case body (1).
Case according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the intermediate wall (10)

comprises a fixing hole (12) for receiving and holding
the shank of a fixing screw (13) which passes through

the lid (2) in order to fix the lid (2) in a tamperproof
manner.
