<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of packaging semiconductor 
chips in structures that provide both an interface to 
external wiring and encapsulation from contaminants. In electronic apparatus, as progress in downsizing, or 
the making of the overall apparatus smaller, continues 
the considerations that must be met in the package for 
the semiconductor chip become greater. The package must 
not only support the chip and protect from deleterious 
environmental contaminants but it must also maintain 
reliable and easily attachable connections to external 
circuitry through ever widening temperature cycling as 
the number of devices in the chip increase. The 
increasing of the density in the chip results in smaller 
and more closely spaced pads and in turn more fragile 
conductor connections result. A current chip packaging technique employs a lead frame 
type structure of dielectric supported conductors with 
close spacing at a central aperture and more relaxed 
spacing at external connectors around the periphery. 
The chip is fastened to the lead frame at the central 
aperture and delicate leads are employed to join the 
close spaced lead frame conductors to the pads on the 
chip. The chip and the lead frame are encapsulated in 
a dielectric body. Such a packaging structure is 
described in U.S. Patent 4,862,245.  As more stringent performance specifications are 
encountered, a need is developing for a package that 
reduces the effects of mechanical stresses from material 
mismatches, that reduces damage to the fragile leads 
joining the chip pads to the package wiring, that 
maintains optimum electrical signal transmission 
properties closer to the pads and with a minimal 
increase in overall dimensions after encapsulation. A semiconductor chip package wherein the chip is a 
major contributor to the strength of the encapsulation 
structure, the external contacts to the package and 
the chip wiring are provided through a multilayer 
wiring member wherein broad metal areas are of mesh 
configuration and the electrical transmission properties 
of the package employ at least portions of one of the 
multilayer wiring member layers as a ground plane, the 
bonds to the chip pads are connected to the layer of 
the multilayer wiring member that is adjacent to the 
chip surface, there is a separate protective encapsulation 
region for the bonds between the wiring and the 
chip pads extending from the chip surface to the top 
of the multilayer wiring member and covering portions 
of the encapsulation structure
