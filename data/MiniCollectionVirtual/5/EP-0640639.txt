<DESCRIPTION>
This is a divisional application of EP 88 108 835.5.The present invention relates to high impact
resistant polycarbonate,
   and a polycarbonate resin composition.
More particularly, it relates to a novel high impact
resistant polycarbonate having cumylphenoxy group
as terminal group(s), a viscosity average molecular
weight of at least 10,000 and an acetone soluble content
of not more than 3.5% by weight;
   and a polycarbonate
resin composition which is of high fluidity and has
high impact resistance, and is rarely subject to a
reduction in molecular weight during molding thereof.A process for producing polycarbonate using
cumylphenol as a terminator or polymerization modifier
has heretofore been known, as described in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 20993/1976. The
polycarbonate produced by this process, however, suffers
from a disadvantage in that impact resistance is not
sufficiently high, because it is produced by the
conventional process with no special modifications except
that cumylphenol is used as a terminator. As a result of extensive investigations, it
has been found that the polycarbonate produced by the
process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No. 20993/1976, has a acetone soluble content of 3.5%
by weight or more, which is mainly responsible for a
reduction in impact resistance.Based on the above findings, further
investigations have been made to develop polycarbonate
which is excellent in impact resistance. As a result,
it has been found that if a polycarbonate oligomer and
bisphenol A as polymerization starting materials and
cumylphenol as a terminator are first reacted under
the turbulent flow condition and, thereafter, an aqueous
solution of alkali hydroxide is added thereto and the
resulting mixture is further reacted under the laminar
flow condition, there can be obtained novel polycarbonate
which has a decreased acetone soluble content and is
of improved impact resistance.Polycarbonate is generally excellent in heat
resistance, mechanical characteristics (particularly
impact resistance), optical characteristics and electrical
characteristics, and further is low in shrinkage during
molding because it is an amorphous polymer. Thus it
has been widely used in production of electric parts,
illumination devices, OA (office automation) devices,
construction materials, automobile parts, and so forth,
particularly as a typical engineering plastic material. A molding of polycarbonate has to be carried
out at elevated temperatures. During this molding,
therefore,
