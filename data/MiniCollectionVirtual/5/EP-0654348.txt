<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a roller with a cylindrical cover surface, a drive for rotating the roller, guide components for moving the strip (16) along a path partly extending around the roller, and a device which brings a central part (44) of the strip in contact with the cylindrical cover surface of the roller before contact is made by the two side parts (48) of the strip with the roller. The device for prodn. of the contact of the central part of the strip with the cylindrical cover surface of the roller incorporates a nozzle (58), which emits an air current on a surface area of the strip. The area on which the air current is directed extends from a position above the hypothetical line of the tangential contact of the strip with the roller in the direction of the two side parts of the strip.

Device for a web, in particular for cooling a 
printed paper web, having a roll (32) having a cylindrical 

outer surface, having a drive (36) for rotating the 
roll (32) and having guide elements for moving the web 

(16) along a path which partially extends around the said 
roll (32), characterized in that an apparatus is provided 

which deflects the central portion (44) of the web (16) 
in the direction of the outer surface of the roll (32) at 

a point which, in relation to the direction of movement 
of the web (16), lies above a hypothetical line (52) of 

tangential contact of the web (16) with the roll (32), in 
order thereby to bring the central portion (44) of the 

web (16) into contact with the cylindrical outer surface 
of the roll (32) before the two side portions (46, 48) of 

the web (16) make contact with the roll (32). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the apparatus comprises a nozzle (58) through which 

an air flow is directed onto a surface portion of the web 
(16) which, in relation to the direction of movement of 

the web (16), extends from a point above the hypothetical 
line (52) of tangential contact in the direction of the 

two side portions (46, 48) of the web (16). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the nozzle (58a) has an essentially V-shaped configuration, 

the central or pointed portion (68a) of the 
nozzle (58a) extending, in relation to the direction of 

movement of the web (16), at least partially above the 
hypothetical line (52) of tangential contact. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the nozzle (58) has an arcuately curving central  

 
portion (68) which is located, in relation to the direction 

of movement of the web (16), above the hypothetical 
line (52) of tangential contact as well as two side 

portions (74, 76), which extend from the central portion 
(68) outwards in relation to the direction of movement of 

the web (16) underneath the hypothetical line (52) of 
tangential contact. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the nozzle (58) has an arcuately 

curved configuration viewed in a plane extending at right 
angles to the central axis of the roll (32). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the central point of curvature of the arcuately 

curved configuration lies on the central axis of the roll 
(32). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that the nozzle (58) has an underside 

portion from which air flows onto the web (16), the 
underside portion comprising a central nozzle portion 

(68) which is located, in relation to the direction of 
movement of the web (16), above the hypothetical line 

(52) of tangential contact, and the underside portion 
further having side nozzle portions (74, 76), which 

extend, in relation to the direction of movement of the 
web (16), underneath the hypothetical line (52) of 

tangential contact, the underside portion of the nozzle 
(58) being located over its entire length at the same 

distance from the outer surface of the roll (32). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that the nozzle (58) extends between the 

side edges of the web (16) and, in the circumferential 
direction, around part of the cylindrical out
er surface 
of the roll (32). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that the nozzle (58) is located over its 

entire length at the same distance from the outer surface 
of the roll (32). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a device (56) for the application  

 
of moisture to the web (16) in relation to the direction 

of movement of the web (16) is provided upstream of the 
roll (32). 
Method for dissipating heat from a web, in 
particular a printed paper web, the web (16) being guided 

about a rotatable cooling roll (32) and heat being 
transmitted from the web (16) onto the outer surface of 

the cooling roll (32), characterized in that, during the 
guidance of the web (16) around the cooling roll (32), a 

central portion (44) of the web (16) comes into contact 
with the outer surface of the cooling roll (32) first and 

then the two side portions (46, 48) of the web (16) make 
contact with the outer surface of the cooling roll (32). 
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the pressure of a fluid is directed against the 

central portion (44) of the web (16) in order to deflect 
the said central portion (44) in the direction of the 

outer surface of the cooling roll (32). 
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that, in relation to the direction of movement of the web 

(16), underneath the point at which the pressure of the 
fluid is directed against the central portion (44) of the 

web (16), the pressure of a fluid is additionally 
directed against both side portions (46, 48) of the web 

(16), in order to press both side portions (46, 48) of 
the web (16) against the outer surface of the cooling 

roll (32). 
Method according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the web (16), in relation to the direction of 

movement of the web, is deflected above the point at 
which both side portions (46, 48) of the web first come 

into contact with the cooling roll (32) and, during the 
contact of both side portions (46, 48) with the cooling 

roll (32), is held in this condition.
