<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for measuring the 
length of a golf drive within a very limited space. Their are currently no 
inexpensive and accurate means of measuring the driving range of a golf 
swing. By combining a compact design based on rotary motion with a very 
sensitive sensing scheme for the initial velocity of the ball, the invention 
disclosed herein allows for instant readouts of driving distance without 
requiring a large open space. DE 36 36 515 discloses an apparatus for estimating the length of a 
golf drive according to the preamble of the appended claim. The present 
invention is characterised by the features of the characterising portion 
of that claim. According to the invention, the apparatus for estimating the length 
of a golf drive includes a golf ball tethered to a rotatable axle at a 
preselected distance from the axle. A sensor is provided to measure the 
angular of velocity of the axle and circuitry is provided for calculating the 
estimated length of the drive from the initial velocity of the ball. Display 
apparatus displays the calculated estimated length. In a preferred 
embodiment, the initial velocity is calculated from the angular velocity of 
the axle and the preselected distance of the ball from the axle by means of 
a digital circuit. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the apparatus for measuring driving 
distance. Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram for the processor that calculates the 
driving distance.  
 With reference first to Fig. 1, a golf ball 1 is tethered by a string 2 
to a rotatable axle 3. The axle 3 also carries a slotted disc 4 which 
cooperates with an optical source and receiver unit 5 for determining the 
angular velocity of the axle 3. As the slotted disc 4 rotates it alternately 
blocks and passes light creating electrical pulses which are conveyed by 
wires to the processing unit that performs the calculations as will be 
described herein below. The apparatus of the present invention includes a base plate 6 
which may be affixed to the ground by means of spikes 7. The output of the optical unit 5 serves as the input to the circuit 
diagram shown in Fig. 2. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the 
art, the circuit of Fig. 2 will calculate the distance that the ball would have 
traveled if untethered and can be programmed to use calibration constants 
based on field measurements. The estimated distance is displayed in 
liquid crystal display 8. In operation, a golfer selects a club and strikes the ball which will 
then rotate on

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for estimating the length of a golf drive comprising: 

a golf ball (1) tethered to a rotatable axle (3) at a preselected 
distance from the axle; 
circuitry for calculating the estimated length of the drive from the 
initial velocity of the ball (1); and 
display apparatus (8) to display the calculated estimated length, 
 
characterized in that:
 
   the rotatable axle (3) is a horizontal axle (3), said axle (3) being 

rotatable about its longitudinal axis; and wherein the initial velocity is 
calculated from the angular velocity of the axle (3) and the preselected 

distance of the ball (1) from the axle.
