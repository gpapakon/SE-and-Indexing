<ABSTRACT>
An air discharge nozzle and method for vehicles having a grill (20) which has a high degree of visual opacity to enhance design aesthetics, low impedance to air flow so that the face velocity remains high, and which does not significantly affect directionality of the air as imparted to the air stream by an upstream control mechanism. The grill (20) is comprised of a monolayer of polygonal cells in an array of cells. The upstream directionality control mechanism includes, in a preferred embodiment, an open intruder frame (30) having converging walls so that the cross-sectional area of the total shadow area of the frame projected on a plane normal to the axial center is essentially constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nozzle for discharging air from
an air supply into an enclosed space, such as a room, or to a
vehicle interior, having a control device for controlling
deflection of air from the nozzle through a grill having a high
degree of visual opacity to obscure elements behind the grill
while maintaining a high face velocity and without significantly
affecting or impairing deflection of the air stream as imparted
thereto by the upstream intruder control member.Current nozzle grills, as found in vehicles, for example,
are very transparent visually in that large areas behind the
grill can be seen at even large off-axis angles, up to 70
degrees. Many grills are thin perforated metal or plastic sheets
which, while having relatively high visual opacity, cause a drop
or loss in air stream face velocity. When the thickness (T) of
the physical interstitial structure forming the grill is reduced,
with a concurrent increase in the face velocity (e.g. reduction
in losses), the visual opacity decreases and large areas behind
the grill can be seen. When the physical thickness T of the
interstitial material is made thin with vane-like depth L, the
grill material interferes with the directionality imparted to the
air stream by the upstream control device.In Stouffer et al. patent US-A-4,686,890 an air nozzle having an
open frame plate intruder- member is disclosed for controlling the
directionality of air discharged from the nozzle. In Jackson 
patent US-A-4,413,551 front plates and directionality control is
achieved by relative lateral movements between the front and
back plates and the only part of the grill which is visible is
the front plate. A somewhat similar directionality control
scheme is illustrated in Elfverson patent US-A-4,928,582. In Gona
et al. patent US-A-3,672,293 commonly adjusted parallel vanes are
used for directionality control.The present invention provides in a nozzle for
discharging air to ambient and having an air inlet and an
axial center and upstream and downstream ends, upstream end
intruder means for causing the deflection of air in different
directions relative to said axial center, said upstream end
having an input with bounding walls and an area A1,
characterized in that said intruder means is a frame having an
area A2 projected on a plane transverse to said axial center
which is substantially less than 50% of said area A1, said
frame being open in the center and having walls which
