<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a practice target made of reusable plastic material which consists of a thermoformed shell with vertical ribs. As a result of the uniform distribution of the heated gas in its interior, the target can still be identified well even after a plurality of hits. The material of the target which has been fired at can be reconditioned to form a target of the same type.

<CLAIMS>
Practice target (Z) which is heated via pipelines by means of a 
gaseous medium generated by an external source, and the 

target 

comprises channel, which extends within said target and is 
laterally defined by ducting ledges, and into which the gaseous 

medium is ducted; 
comprises a plateshaped rear wall (1) and a front wall (3), both 
of which are made of plastic material, and the front wall (3) is 

attached to the rear wall (1); 
comprises a plurality of elements (4), which protrude into the 
inner space (2) between rear wall (1) and targeted front wall (3) 

and are approximately parallel and vertically arranged; 
comprises in the area of the bottom edge of the rear wall (1) or 
front wall (3) an approximately horizontally extending pipe (6) 

which is connected to the source (7) of the gaseous medium, 
characterized in that
a) the rear wall (1) is composed of a cup of shape-retaining 
deep-drawn and re-usable plastic material, such as 

polyethylene; 
b) the elements (4) are embossed as ribs/crimps into the rear 
wall (1) by way of deep-drawing; 
c) the ribs/crimps (4) allow at least in one point of their total 
length a transverse flow (9) of the gaseous medium between 

the intermediate spaces produced by said ribs/crimps (4); 
d) the pipe (5) which is connected to the source (7) of the 
gaseous medium has for each intermediate space between 

ribs/crimps (4) at least one blow-out opening (8) and attached 
so as to be easily detachable. 
Practice target according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
front and rear wall (1, 3) are made of the same re-usable plastic 

material.  
 
Practice target according to Claim 1 or 4, 
characterized in that
 
the front wall is at least partially provided with a non-reflective 

coating. 
Practice target according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the blow-out openings (8) have a diameter (D) which either 
increases with increasing distance (E) from the feed point (12) of 

the gaseous medium or remains unchanged.
