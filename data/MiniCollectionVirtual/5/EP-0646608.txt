<ABSTRACT>
A polyisocyanate of urethane-modified isocyanurate type, prepared by the cyclotrimerization of at least one 
aliphatic or alicyclic diisocyanate either after being reacted with a polyhydric alcohol or in the presence of the alcohol 

and having a mean number of functional groups of 4.5 to 10 and a viscosity of 5,000 to 100,000 mPa.s at 25 °C in a state 
substantially free from the diisocyanate monomer and a solvent; a thermally diisociable blocked polyisocyanate; and a 

thermosetting curing agent composition and a thermosetting one-pack coating composition each containing the blocked 
polyisocyanate. The above polyisocyanate and blocked polyisocyanate are superior to the conventional ones in the 

compatibility with polyols and so forth. The curing agent composition which is improved is not only low-temperature 
curing effect but also yellowing resistance and gives a coating material excellent in weather resistance and so forth 

in addition to the above properties. Hence, the curing agent composition is utilizable as adhesive, tackifier, sealant 
and so forth, and the coating composition containing the blocked polyisocyanate or the curing agent composition 

is utilizable as automotive topcoating or intercoating material, chipping-resistant coating material, automotive part 

coating material, precoated metal or rustproof steel sheet for domestic electric appliances and business machines, 
building material coating material, plastics coating material, tackifier, sealant and electrodeposition coating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
polyisocyanate, a novel blocked polyisocyanate, and a
thermosetting type hardener composition and a
thermosetting type coating composition using the same.Polyurethane resin coating compositions have very
excellent wear resistance, chemical resistance, and stain
resistance. Furthermore, polyurethane resin coating
compositions comprising, as a hardener, a non-yellowing
polyisocyanate derived from aliphatic diisocyanates,
especially hexamethylene diisocyanate, or from alicyclic
diiscyanates, especially isophorone diisocyanate, are also
excellent in weathering resistance. Therefore, demand for
these coating compositions tends to increase.However, polyurethane resin coating compositions
are generally two-pack type and are extremely inconvenient
for use. That is, a conventional urethane resin coating
composition is constituted of two components, a polyol and 
a polyisocyanate, which are separately stored and which
must be mixed at the time of coating. Furthermore, once
they are mixed, the coating composition sets to gel in a
short time and therefore can no longer be used. This
makes it very difficult to attain automation in the field
of on-line coatings such as precoating and postcoating,
for instance, spray coating, dip coating, roll coating,
and electrodepsition coating which are applied to metallic
articles and plastic molded articles in automobiles,
appliances, business machines and building construction,
including rust protected steel sheets, and in the fields
of adhesives, adhesion imparting agents, and sealing
agents containing polyisocyanates.Moreover, it is necessary to sufficiently clean
spray guns and equipment used therewith and coating pans
or vessels after completion of the coating operation,
causing much reduction of operating efficiency. In order
to overcome these defects, it has been proposed to employ
blocked polyisocynates wherein active isocyanate groups
are all blocked with a blocking agent. The blocked
polyisocyanates do not react with polyols at room
temperature, but they dissociate the blocking agent at
baking temperatures to regenerate the active isocyanate
groups which react with polyols to bring about a
crosslinking reaction. Therefore, the above defects seems 
to be tentatively overcome.However, the crosslinking reaction requires a high
baking temperature such as 150-200°C. Use of the high
baking temperature causes increase of energy cost and
increase of atmospheric pollution, and in addition
causes, when coated on, serious defects in the
