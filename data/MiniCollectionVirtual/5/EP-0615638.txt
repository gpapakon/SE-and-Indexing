<DESCRIPTION>
 A REAL-TIME RUNNING AVERAGING DEVICEField of the Invention t5 j The present invention relates to real-time devices, and more specifically to real-time devices for calculating an average of values represented by a signal.10 Background of the InventionMobile radio (electronic) devices often are required to adapt to changes in their environment or to vary the output which they are to produce in a nearly instantaneous manner. This has led to an increased reliance upon real-time15 evaluation of data representing physical quantities. "Real-time" here refers to the fact that the evaluation is performed at essentially the same time as the data is acquired. Real-time systems typically require very rapid processing of data as that data is obtained. Non-real-time evaluation occurs at some time long after the data is obtained. For example, when a mobile unit is requesting a service, a response from20 the system to the mobile unit takes a long time; the time lag in processing the data can cause the results to be obsolete by the time those results are obtained.The information processing limitations of the electronic hardware involved with a particular device help determine the operational capacity and25 maximum processing speed of that device. Hence minimization of hardware complexity and increases in hardware response time are critical to evaluation of data for those applications.* One example of such a time-critical application is found in the field of30 cellular telephones. Cellular mobile telephones (mobile units) must receive signals* broadcast from the cell site transmitters. The mobile telephones are often themselves 

 in motion. This motion leads to changes in the strength of the signals received by the mobile unit. Cellular telephone networks attempt to maintain an acceptable signal level at each site, and switch the signal to a new cell when the average signal received from the mobile unit becomes weak, i.e. below the acceptable level. This switching may be accomplished by comparing the intensity of the average value of the signals from different cells and selecting that signal which is strongest.Determination of the average value is presently accomplished in the following manner. The receiver measures the signal intensity at a number of points, for example twenty, and stores these values in a memory. The values are then added and the sum is divided by the number of stored values. This yields the mean (average) value of the signal intensity. Typically, the next average is obtained by discarding the oldest
