<ABSTRACT>
When a moving image is encoded, a region for effecting intro-coding is dispersed into part of a screen unit but 
not into the whole screen such as a frame or a field. Further, a flag representing its structure is added. The structure of 

encoded image data is modified for high speed reproduction in accordance with the data of the flag, and is transmitted 
or recorded. When the encoded data is decoded, the region for which decentralized intra-coding is effected is decoded 

by using the multiplexed flag, and smooth and high speed normal or reverse reproduction is made. Accordingly, the 
present invention can accomplish an encoder, a recorder, a device for recording/transmission formatting (bit stream 

syntax) and reproduction, and a decoder in order to smoothly reproduce a moving image data at a high speed either 
in normal or reverse mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an encoding method, 
a decoding method, an encoding apparatus, a decoding 
apparatus, a recording medium, and a recording, reproducing, 
and decoding apparatus which are suitable for data compression 
of moving images. Since moving image data contain an extremely large 
amount of information, there have heretofore been required 
recording mediums which allow a very high continuous transmission 
speed in order to record and reproduce the moving image 
data. At present, NTSC television video signals, for example, 
are recorded on and reproduced from magnetic tapes and 
optical discs. To record a video signal on a smaller-size recording 
medium having a smaller recording capacity for a longer period 
of time, it is necessary to employ a system for encoding the 
video signal highly efficiently and decoding a read video 
signal highly efficiently. To meet such a requirement, there 
have been proposed highly efficient encoding systems which 
rely upon the correlation of video signals. One of such 
proposed systems is an MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)  
 
system. According to the MPEG system, the difference between 
image frames of a video signal is produced to reduce the 
redundancy in the time-axis direction, and thereafter the 
video signal is processed by an orthogonal transform process 
such as a discrete cosine transform (DCT) process to reduce 
the redundancy in the spatial-axis directions. The video 
signal is thus encoded highly efficiently and recorded on a 
given recording medium. A recording medium on which a highly efficiently 
encoded video signal is recorded can be played back by decoding 
a reproduced signal efficiently according to inverse orthogonal 
transform or the like to reproduce the video signal. High-speed playback of a recording medium on which a 
highly efficiently encoded video signal is recorded can be 
effected by decoding the video signal at intervals of several 
frames and outputting the decoded signal at the same speed as 
the speed of normal reproduction. In the encoding according to the MPEG system, one 
video sequence is divided into a frame group (GOP), e.g., a 
unit of 12 frames. Each of the frames may be classified into 
one of three types according to a predictive process.
 
   I: Intra-coded frame (I picture);
 
   P: Frame with motion predicted from a past frame (P 
picture); and
 
   B: Frame with motion predicted from past and future 
frames (B picture). A conventional GOP arrangement is shown in FIG. 26
