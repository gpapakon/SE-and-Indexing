<ABSTRACT>
A basic structure, consisting, namely, of an underframe (10), produced in two half-parts (11, 12) and including a support (112) for a condenser (60) and a blower half-casing (111), of a flip tray (recovery tray) (2), of an upper blower half-casing (3), of a heating and blowing duct (40) for dry air and of a duct (50) for sucking out moist air may, as need be, be modified in terms of the structure of the clothes drier with condensation mode or with evacuation mode, simply by fitting a condenser (60) or a deflector grid to the support (112) and fitting an air diffuser (70) for transverse cooling of the condenser (60) or by fitting a collector (manifold) at the side of the said support (112) of the condenser (60).
