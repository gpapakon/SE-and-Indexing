<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition
containing a graft modified cycloolefin resin, an elastomer
and polyamide, having excellent impact resistance and
adhesion of coating, and being low in water absorption.Conventionally, polyolefins, such as polyethylene or
polypropylene, are known as resins excellent in chemical
resistance and solvent resistance. However, when
polyolefin is low in crystallinity index, it cannot be said
that the polyolefin has sufficient rigidity, heat
resistance and solvent resistance.On that account, there is adopted a process for
improving polyolefin in heat resistance and rigidity by the
addition thereto of a nucleating agent or a process for
enhancing polyolefin in crystallinity index by cooling a
molten polyolefin gradually. However, it is hard to say
that the effect obtained thereby is sufficient.Apart from such polyolefins as referred to above, it
is reported that copolymers obtained by the reaction of
ethylene with bulky monomers are excellent in properties
such as heat resistance in comparison with conventionally 
known polyolefins (see, for example, U.S. Patent 2,883,372
and Japanese Patent Publication No. 14910/1971).In this connection, on the basis of the acquired
information on the fact that cyclic random copolymers
obtained by copolymerization of specific cycloolefins as
bulky monomers and ethylene are excellent in heat
resistance, heat aging characteristics, dielectric
characteristics and rigidity, the present applicant has
already proposed random copolymers obtained by using
specific cycloolefins (see Japanese Patent L-O-P
Publications Nos. 168708/1985, 120816/1986, 115912/1986,
115916/1986, 271308/1986, 272216/1986, 252406/1987 and
252407/1987) and mixtures thereof with polyamide, see EP-A-0 458 365 and EP-A-0 532 337.On the other hand, an attempt has been made to
incorporate other resins into polyamides for the purpose of
improving characteristics inherent in polyamides. In spite
of various improvements suggested as above, there was much
room for further improvement on various characteristics
such as water absorption properties, molding shrinkage,
heat-resisting rigidity or adhesion of coating.The present invention intends to provide, as its
object, a cycloolefin resin composition containing the
graft-modified of the above-mentioned cycloolefin resin and
polyamide, which is capable of forming molded articles 
excellent particularly in impact strength, low water
absorption properties and adhesion of coating.The present invention provides a cycloolefin resin
