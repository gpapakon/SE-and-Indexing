<ABSTRACT>
A plastic barrel (10) has a substantially cylindrical wall (12), a disk-shaped lower bottom (14) and a corresponding upper bottom (16) in which a closable bunghole opening is arranged if required, and a continuous carrying and transporting ring (22) arranged on the outer wall (12) of the barrel at the proximity of the upper bottom (16) and having a downwardly inclined horizontal contact surface (24) and an inwardly inclined vertical contact surface (26) for the claws of a barrel gripper. A sunk-in bung housing (28) with a projecting bunghole pipe (30) is arranged in the upper bottom (16) of the barrel. The inner diameter of the bunghole pipe (30) amounts to 100 mm or more and this bunghole pipe (30) can be closed in a gas- and liquid-tight manner by means of a screwable screw cap (32, 34).

A plastics barrel (10) with a substantially 
cylindrical barrel wall (12), a disk-shaped barrel 

floor (14) and a corresponding barrel top (16), in 
which a closable closure aperture is optionally 

arranged, and with a circumferential carrying and 
transporting ring (22), which is arranged on the 

outer barrel wall (12) in the vicinity of the barrel 
top (16) and comprises a downward facing horizontal 

and an inward facing vertical bearing surface (24, 
26) for the grab claws of a barrel grab,
 
characterised in that a recessed closure housing 

(28) with a projecting closure socket (30) is 
arranged in the centre of the barrel top (16), the 

internal diameter of the closure socket (30) 
measuring at least 100 mm or more and this closure 

socket (30) being closable in a gas-tight and 
liquid-tight manner by means of a screw lid (32, 34) 

which can be screwed thereon. 
A plastics barrel according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the internal diameter of the 

closure socket (30) measures approximately 150 mm 
for a screw lid with an external diameter of 

approximately 180 mm. 
A plastics barrel according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the internal diameter of the 

closure socket (30) measures approximately 225 mm 
for a screw lid with an external diameter of 

approximately 270 mm.  
 
A plastics barrel according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that, measured in the horizontal 

plane of the barrel top (16), the diameter of the 
closure housing (28) is between 200 mm and 300 mm, 

preferably approximately 230 mm, and the diameter of 
the flat closure housing floor (40) measures between 

180 mm and 250 mm, preferably approximately 190 mm. 
A plastics barrel according to claim 1 or 3,
 
characterised in that
, measured in the horizontal 
plane of the barrel top (16), the diameter of the 

closure housing (28) is between 300 mm and 400 mm, 
preferably approximately 330 mm, and the diameter of 

the flat closure housing floor (40) measures between 
250 mm and 330 mm, preferably approximately 270 mm. 
A plastics barrel according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 
5, characterised in that the horizontal plane of the 

screw lid (32) screwed onto the closure socket (30) 
is arranged at the same height as or approximately 

flush with the barrel top (16) or beneath the barrel 
top (16). 
A plastics barrel according to one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the horizontal 

plane of the screw lid (12) screwed onto the closure 
socket (30) ends between the horizontal plane of the 

barrel top (16) and the horizontal plane of the 
upper edge (36) of the carrying and transporting 

ring (22). 
A plastics barrel according to one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the horizontal 

plane of the barrel top (16) is arranged above the 
horizontal plane of the upper edge (36) of the 

carrying and transporting ring (22).  
 
A plastics barrel according to one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the horizontal 

plane of the barrel top (16) is arranged beneath the 
horizontal plane of the upper edge (36) of the 

carrying and transporting ring (22). 
A plastics barrel according to one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the upper edge 

(36) of the carrying and transporting ring (22), the 
barrel top (16) and the screw lid (32, 34) screwed 

onto the closure socket (30) are arranged in 
substantially the same horizontal plane. 
A plastics barrel according to one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 10, characterised in that a second, 

small closure aperture (38) is additionally provided 
laterally in the barrel top (16) for emptying the 

residual barrel content. 
A plastics barrel according to one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the barrel top 

(16) as a whole is slightly inclined, namely - 
viewed in the normal position of the barrel - is 

constructed so as to be between 2 mm and 12 mm, 
preferably approximately 8 mm, higher on the side 

comprising the additional residue emptying closure
