<ABSTRACT>
A water distillation system (10) is disclosed. The system (10) includes a boiling chamber (11) and a condensation chamber (12). Water is fed via an inlet pipe (13) to a degassing chamber (15) where volatile gases are removed from the water. The water is evaporated in the boiling chamber (11) and the vapour is in turn condensed in the condensing chamber (12). The distilled water is collected in a water storage tank (30) and is used with a pump (28) and entrainment device (27) to provide a substantial vacuum within the system (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water purification systems and, in particular,
to a water distillation system which is substantially more efficient than known
systems.There are a variety of methods of purifying water, one of these methods being
distillation. One method of distilling water includes vaporising the liquid water under
a vacuum and then condensing the water vapour, once again under vacuum so that the
liquid water which has been condensed does not include any impurities. Examples of
prior art methods are shown in WO87/07847, AU 26007/88 and US 3,558,436.It is an object of the present invention to provide a water distillation system
which is substantially inexpensive to install, and is relatively efficient.According to the present invention, a water distillation system comprises a
water evaporator, a water condenser and a water storage tank, the evaporator,
condenser and tank being connected in series so that water passes from the evaporator
to the tank via the condenser, a water inlet to deliver feed water to the evaporator, a
water outlet from said tank, a degassing chamber interposed between said water inlet
and said evaporator for removing dissolved gases in said feed water and for
maintaining a predetermined level of said feed water in said evaporator, vacuum pump
means to reduce pressure in said evaporator and condenser relative to atmospheric
pressure, wherein said vacuum pump means includes an entrainment device and a
circulation pump to pump water from said water storage tank around a circulation
pipe, and wherein said pump receives water from said water storage tank and outputs
water to a through input of said entrainment device returning water to said water
storage tank, said entrainment device further including a transverse port 
interconnected to an outlet of said condenser to entrain, under vacuum, condensate
from said condenser to water passing to said water storage tank, and a single
refrigerant circuit, said refrigerant circuit including a condenser coil in said water
evaporator, an evaporator coil in said water condenser, a capillary restrictor through
which refrigerant from said condenser coil passes to said evaporator coil, a refrigerant
compressor to circulate said refrigerant around said circuit, and desuperheater means
through which the refrigerant passes to cool the refrigerant, said desuperheater means
being positioned operatively after said compressor and before said condenser coil,
characterised in that the refrigerant circuit further comprises a cooling coil,
