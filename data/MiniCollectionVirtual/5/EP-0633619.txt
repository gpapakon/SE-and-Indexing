<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air electrode
bodies for solid oxide fuel cells, a process for the
production of the air electrode bodies, and a process
for the production of the solid oxide fuel cells.Since the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) operate
at high temperature of 1,000°C, electrode reaction is
extremely active. Therefore, a noble metal
catalyst such as precious metal platinum need not be used at
all. Further, their polarization is small, and output
voltage is relatively high. Thus, the energy-conversion
efficiency is far greater as compared with
other fuel cells. In addition, since the constituent
parts of the solid oxide fuel cell are all solid, the
solid oxide fuel cell in stable, and has a long-life.At present, it is considered that zirconia is a
most promising material for constituting a solid
electrolyte film of the SOFC, and a lanthanum base
perovskite-type composite oxide is promising as a
constituting material of the air electrode body (See
Energy General Engineering 13-2, 1990).However, it is reported that if a solid electrolyte
film made of zirconia is formed on a surface of the
lanthanum base perovskite-type composite oxide having a 
stoichiometrical composition, the zirconia reacts with
perovskite composite, oxide at around 1,200°C to produce
La2Zr2O7 (See Proceedings of SOFC-NAGOYA 87-92, 1989).
This fact means that when a laminated structure between
an air electrode body and a solid electrolyte is to be
formed, a high resistance layer made of La2Zr2O7 is
produced between the air electrode body and the solid
electrolyte on heating at not less than 1,200°C, which
largely reduces output from the cell.As the structure of the SOFC unit cells, a self-supporting
type structure is preferred, in which an air
electrode body itself is used as a support and a solid
electrolyte film and a fuel electrode film is formed
thereon. As compared with the case in which an air
electrode body film is formed on the surface of a porous
ceramic support, the self-supporting type structure has
the merit that the entire structure is simple, the
production process may be simplified, reduced costs are
possible, and loss due to the gas-diffusing resistance
is diminished to raise outputs from the unit cell.
However, when the oxide electrolyte film is to be formed
on the surface-of the air electrode body, La2Zr2O7 is
formed at the interface.It is an object of the present invention to
prevent occurrence of a high resistance layer made of
La2Zr2O7 between the self-supporting air electrode body
and the solid
