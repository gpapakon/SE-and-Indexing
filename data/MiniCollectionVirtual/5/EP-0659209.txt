<DESCRIPTION>
 CANCER THERAPY UTILIZING MALIGNANT CELLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention was made with the support of the Government under NIH Grant No. AI00697. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.Therapies designed to cure or prevent the progression of cancer are often based on biological or metabolic differences between normal and malignant cells. Many cancers are characterized by unrestricted or abnormal growth of the cancer cell population at the expense of host cells and tissues. The relatively rapid cancer cell growth rate compared to normal cells requires high levels of metabolic activity on the part of the cancer cells. One activity associated with malignant cells, the high rate of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication as compared with that of most normal cells, has been extensively examined as a potential target for therapeutic approaches to treat cancer. Thus, there has been a great deal of effort directed toward the development of therapeutic agents or treatments that preferentially kill malignant cells by interfering with one or more aspects of their DNA replication. Such approaches have met with some success, but because such therapies are often nonspecific, normal host cells with high growth rates, such as bone marrow cells, are also susceptible to killing by the same agent or therapy. The toxicity of cancer therapies toward normal cells often leads to severe side effects and limits their ultimate efficacy. Another difficulty related to cancer treatment centers on the characteristic spread or metastasis of cancer cells to sites distant from the origin of the initial cancer cell. Advanced stages of cancer are often associated with malignant growths at multiple sites. Such spreading often complicates or prevents the successful treatment of cancer by surgical means. 

 The difficulties related to the design of effective therapies for cancer has spurred intense research directed toward understanding the molecular basis of cancer and its development from normal cells. This research has led to an understanding of some of the biological events that lead to full-blown malignancy starting from a normal cell. Land et al.. Science, 222, 771 (1983) summarized research findings that implicated cellular oncogenes in the development of cancer. Additional subsequent efforts have been directed toward understanding the function of oncogenes at a molecular level. Activated oncogenes have been used to construct animal models of cancer development, further substantiating their role in
