<ABSTRACT>
Improved PMD performance is achieved in fiber optic cable fabricated in 
accordance with the principles of the invention by twisting each of a plurality of optical 

fibers in a controlled manner as the cable is being formed. A controlled amount of twist is 
imparted to each optical fiber uniformly along its entire length. Uniformity of twist reduces 

twist-induced strain and promotes optimum PMD reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the optical transmission of information and, more 
particularly, to a method for fabricating a fiber optic cable having improved polarization 
mode dispersion performance to reduce signal degradation in long distance optical 
transmission systems. Long distance optical fiber transmission systems, such as those employed in 
undersea or transcontinental terrestrial lightwave systems that use optical amplifiers, are 
subject to polarization mode dispersion (PMD) which causes serious signal degradation. 
PMD is caused by a difference in the group delay for two orthogonal modes of an optical 
signal propagating in an optical fiber. PMD is especially important in lightwave systems 
using optical amplifiers because, In such systems, the transmitted optical signal propagates 
along the entire lightwave system without retiming or regeneration. Over a several 
thousand kilometer lightwave system, PMD can cause the difference in group delay for the 
two orthogonal modes to be large enough to cause excessive pulse broadening which 
results in severe signal degradation. Unlike other optical parameters, PMD is very sensitive to fiber configuration and 
environmental changes such as temperature and pressure. For example, a fiber laid in a 
straight path on a smooth surface has higher PMD than does a fiber which is tightly 
wound on bobbin. PMD also increases in optical fibers during the cabling process because 
fibers are cabled in a purposefully relaxed condition where stress and strain on the fibers is 
minimized. PMD is higher in optical fibers in a relaxed condition because there is less of 
the mode coupling of the orthogonal modes that results from random localized 
birefringence as when the fiber has perturbations due to stress or strain. Although perturbations in optical fibers tend to reduce PMD, other fiber 
parameters can be adversely affected when the fiber is subjected to a high level of 
perturbations. For example, perturbations which reduce fiber relaxation and PMD tend to 
increase fiber loss and decrease fiber strength-a result which is contrary to present 
lightwave systems design rules. This most probably explains why most fiber optic cables 
are unsuitable for use in long distance lightwave transmission systems using optical 
amplifiers where low PMD is desired.  Improved PMD performance is achieved in fiber optic cable fabricated In 
accordance with the principles of the invention by twisting each of a plurality of optical 
fibers in a controlled manner as the cable is
