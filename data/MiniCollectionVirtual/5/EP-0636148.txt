<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photopolymerizable 
compositions containing photoinitiator systems that 
absorb in the visible. More particularly, this 
invention pertains to photopolymerizable compositions 
containing selected photodissociable initiators in 
combination with visible sensitizers. Many of the conventional photoinitiators or 
photoinitiator systems limit the applicability of 
photopolymerizable compositions because they are 
activatable primarily by radiation in the ultraviolet or 
shorter wavelength region (i.e., blue and green) of the 
visible spectrum. The availability of reliable, 
relatively inexpensive lasers which emit in the longer 
wavelength (i.e., red) region of the visible spectrum 
and which can be used as output devices for electronic 
imaging systems has made it desirable to develop 
photoinitiator systems which are activatable by this 
spectral region. Applications for photopolymerizable 
compositions containing these photoinitiator systems 
include graphic arts films, proofing, printing plates, 
and photoresists. The preparation of holograms in 
photopolymerizable compositions also requires 
photoinitiator systems activatable by radiation in this 
spectral region.  
 Photopolymerizable compositions containing 
2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaarylbisimidazoles, or HABI's, are 
well known. Sensitizers which extend the sensitivity of 
these compositions are also known. Baum, U.S. Patent 
3,652,275, discloses photopolymerizable compositions 
containing selected bis(p-dialkylaminobenzylidene)-ketones 
as sensitizers of HABI photoinitiator systems. 
Dueber, U.S. Patent 4,162,162, discloses selected 
sensitizers derived from aryl ketones and p-dialkylaminoaldehydes. 
Smothers, U.S. Patent 4,917,977, 
and Monroe, U.S. Patent 4,987,230, also disclose visible 
sensitizers for photopolymerizable compositions. 
However, despite the advances which have been made, 
there is a continuing need for photoinitiator systems 
which are sensitive to the visible region of the 
spectrum. The novel compositions of this invention are 
photopolymerizable compositions in which polymerization 
is initiated by free radicals generated by actinic 
radiation. As described herein, these compositions 
comprise a photoinitiator system comprising a 
sensitizer; a polymerizable monomer; and, optionally, a 
binder. The composition may also comprise other 
ingredients which are conventional components of 
photopolymerizable systems. The sensitizers used in this invention typically 
produce photopolymerizable compositions with 
pho
