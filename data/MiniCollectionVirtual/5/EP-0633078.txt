<ABSTRACT>
A hollow cylindrical preform made of steel contg. at least 0.2 wt % C and at least 3 wt % carbide forming elements such as Cr, Mo and B is heated in an inert atmosphere to its austenising temp and then cooled to a metastable austenite range which is below the recrystallisation temp. and above the martensite forming temp. It is then pressure rolled to produce the required profile and rapidly cooled to below the martensite forming temp. After martensitic transformation it is tempered at 400-600 deg C to precipitate the special carbides before being cooled to room temp. Pref., the forming tool, ie the roller is preheated prior to rolling. The temp. of the preform is constantly measured during rolling and the difference between the nominal and optimal temps is used to regulate the rolling speed during forming.

Method for fabricating a hollow steel body with an 
inner- and/or outer profiling by flow-turning particularly 

for fabricating a toothed ring out of a 
hollow cylindrical or pot-shaped blank wherein the 

flow-turning for the profiling is accomplished at a 
constant temperature in a metastable austenitic condition,
characterized in
that the blank consists of an austenitic steel 
capable of form hardening with a sufficient amount 

of carbon and special carbide formers, and is 
heated to austeniting temperature in an inert 

atmosphere, and subsequently is cooled into the 
area of metastable austenite below the re-crystallisation 

and above the martensite forming temperature, 
that in this area of the metastable austenite the 
flow-turning of the profiling is accomplished, 
that following the flow-turning the profiled 
hollow body is quickly cooled to a temperature 

below the martensite forming temperature, and 
that after the completed martensite forming the 
profiled hollow body is tempered at temperatures 

from 400 to 600Â°C for the precipitation of special 
carbides, and after completed tempering is cooled 

to room temperature. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the blank consists of a steel comprising at least 

0.2 % carbon by weight, and at least 3 % by weight 
of the special carbide forming elements chromium, 

molybdenum, and Vanadium either single or in a 
plurality. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the tools for the forming of the profile are 

pre-heated prior to the forming process. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the temperature of the hollow body 

is continuously measured during the flow-turning, 
and is compared with a pre-set nominal temperature, 

and the result of the comparison is used for controlling 
the flow-turning speed.
