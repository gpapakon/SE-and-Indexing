<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a supporting leg (4) for trucks (1), with a rotary movement of 180 DEG  relative to the pin (6) which connects this supporting leg (4) to the telescopic beam (3). The rotary movement is produced by engagement of a perpendicular toothed rack in one piece with the leg. The toothed rack engages pneumatically in a gear which is fastened to the beam (3) and on which the toothed rack can climb up as it were.

TILTING DEVICE FOR THE JACK-FOOT OF A TRUCK-MOUNTED
HYDRAULIC CRANE
 that includes a jack-foot (4) with an articulated
connection to a coupling pin (6) that is in turn permanently joined to a

telescopic crosspiece (3) projecting from the truck body (1), characterised
by a gear wheel (16), firmly fitted on a coupling pin (6) characterised by the

fact that the gear wheel (16) is coupled with a rack (15) driven by a
pneumatic jack (17), which is positioned axially as compared with the

above-mentioned component (4), so that the axial movement of the rack
(15) towards the pneumatic jack (17) rotates by 180Â° the jack-foot (4) and

the rack (15) on the coupling pin (6).
TILTING DEVICE FOR THE JACK-FOOT OF A TRUCK-MOUNTED
HYDRAULIC CRANE
. Characterised, according to the main claim, by the
fact that the head (5) of the jack-foot is consequently formed by two vertical

wings (9-9') with through holes for the coupling pin (6).
TILTING DEVICE FOR THE JACK-FOOT OF A TRUCK-MOUNTED
HYDRAULIC CRANE
 . Characterised, according to the main claim, by the
fact that the head (5) of the jack-foot is consequently formed by two vertical

wings (9-9') with through holes for the mobile pin (14) used for blocking
purposes during the operation phases.
TILTING DEVICE FOR THE JACK-FOOT OF A TRUCK-MOUNTED
HYDRAULIC CRANE
 . Characterised, according to the main claim, by the
fact that the vertical wing (9) of the jack-foot head (5) has a hole (12) to

house the safety pin (13) during idle phases.
TILTING DEVICE FOR THE JACK-FOOT OF A TRUCK-MOUNTED
HYDRAULIC CRANE
 . Characterised, according to the main claim, by the
fact that supporting beam (3) has two vertical wings (8-8') with drilled tabs

(11-11') to house the coupling pin (6), the mobile pin (14) and the safety
pin(13).
