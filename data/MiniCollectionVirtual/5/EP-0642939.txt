<ABSTRACT>
The wheel suspension comprises a wheel carrier (2) supporting the wheel (1), which carrier is firmly connected to a telescopic shock absorber (3). The latter is pivotably supported by its upper end on the vehicle body (6). The wheel carrier (2) is connected in its lower area by way of a ball joint (7) to a transverse link (8), which is swivellably supported by its inner end area on the vehicle body (6). In order to relieve the piston rod (4) of disturbing deflections and to achieve a good response of the suspension, the spring plate (11) is connected to the transverse link (8) so that it can pivot about an axis of rotation (12) and so arranged that the line of action (13) of the support spring (10) runs with a lateral offset (C) in relation to the axis of rotation (12). At the same time the spring plate (11) is also supported by way of a transversely aligned coupling strut (15) in relation to the wheel carrier (2).

<CLAIMS>
A damper strut type vehicle wheel suspension, with a wheel support (2) 
bearing the wheel (1), which wheel support (2) is firmly connected with the 

lower end of a telescopic shock-absorber (3), the upper end of which is 
articulatedly supported on the vehicle structure (6), in addition with a 

transverse arm (8), which is swivellably connected on the structure side 
about an axis (9) running at least approximately longitudinally and is 

connected externally in an articulated manner with the wheel support (2), 
in which the vehicle structure (6) rests against the transverse arm (8) via a 

support spring (10) and a spring plate (11), which is swivellably supported 
on the transverse arm (8) about a rotation axis (12) running approximately 

in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and by a coupling strut (15) 
running at a vertical distance from the transverse arm (8) and approximately 

in the transverse direction of the vehicle, 
characterised in that the said rotation axis (12) of the spring plate is 

staggered laterally in relation to the line of force (13) of the support spring 
(10) on the transverse arm and the spring plate (11) is supported by the 

coupling strut (15) on the wheel support (2) or on the shock- absorber (3). 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 1, characterised in that the rotation 
axis (12) of the spring plate (11) is staggered with respect to the line of 

force (13) of the support spring (10) towards the centre of the vehicle and 
the coupling strut (15) runs above the transverse arm (8). 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 1, characterised in that the rotation 
axis (12) of the spring plate (11) is staggered with respect to the line of 

force (13) of the support spring (10) to the exterior and the coupling strut 
(15) engages beneath the transverse arm (8) on the wheel support (2). 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 1 for a steerable wheel,  
 

characterised in that the outer joint (17) of the coupling strut (15) is 
staggered with respect to the steering rotation axis (16) running through the 

outer transverse arm joint (7) and the upper supporting joint (5) of the shock 
absorber (3) towards the exterior of the vehicle. 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 1 with a transverse arm broken 
down into two rod-shaped individual arms, characterised in that the spring 

plate (11) is swivellably arranged on one of the individual guides and the 
coupling strut is formed by a triangular arm, which is connected via a 

ball-and-socket joint with the wheel support (2) and via a pivot bearing, 
which is angularly rigid, with the spring plate (11). 
A wheel suspension according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
triangular arm, acting as coupling strut, is formed by two guide rods which 

are connected in each case articulatedly with the spring plate (11) or with 
the wheel support (2), in which in top view the distance between the 

articulation points on the spring plate (11) is greater than on the wheel 
support (2).
