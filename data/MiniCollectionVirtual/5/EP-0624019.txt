<ABSTRACT>
Punctured binary convolutional codes are used 
in a trellis coded modulation scheme to achieve 

spectral efficiencies as high as those of multi-dimensional 
codes, using simple hardware. A base 

rate 1/2 binary convolutional code is punctured to 
rate n/k. The output of the punctured encoder 18 is 

mapped to a four-way partition (60, 62, 64, 66; 120, 
122, 124, 126) of a 2
N
 point two-dimensional QAM 
constellation. The four-way partition consists of 

a two-way partition in both the I and Q dimensions. 
The two-way partitions of each dimension are used to 

transmit the two level output of the rate n/k binary 
convolutional coder. (N-2) "uncoded" bits (24) are 

transmitted by selecting the unique constellation 
point in a partition group. The code has an average 

throughput of 

(N-2)+2n/k 
 
 bits per symbol. The 

invention is also applicable to trellis coded 
amplitude modulation schemes based on 2
N
 possible 
amplitude levels provided along a one-dimensional 

constellation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
communication of digital data using trellis coded
amplitude modulation (AM) and trellis coded
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with punctured
convolutional codes. One of the various
applications for which the present invention is
particularly well suited is in the transmission of
digital television signals.Digital data, for example, digitized,
compressed television (NTSC) or high-definition
television (HDTV) signals can be transmitted over
terrestrial very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high-frequency
(UHF), or cable television analog channels
to end users. Analog channels deliver corrupted and
transformed versions of their input waveforms.
Corruptions of the waveform include linear,
frequency-selective amplitude and phase distortion,
nonlinear or harmonic distortion, and multiplicative
fading. Additive corruption of the waveform, due to
statistical thermal and impulse noise, may be
countered using forward error correction codes.In order to communicate digital data via an
analog channel, the data is modulated using, for
example, a form of pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). 
Typically, quadrature amplitude modulation or
single-sideband (SSB) modulation is chosen to
efficiently use the available channel bandwidth.
QAM is a quadrature, or orthogonal combination of
two PAM signals. When viewed as coordinates of a
plane, the combined PAM signals form a
"constellation" of possible transmission levels.
Each transmitted constellation point is called a
symbol. For example, two independent, quadrature
four-level AM signals form a 16-QAM constellation
which encodes four bits. A 32-point constellation
can be formed with dependent six-level AM quadrature
signals, encoding five bits per symbol.In pulse amplitude modulation, each signal is a
pulse whose amplitude level is selected from a fixed
set of levels. In 16-QAM, each of the quadrature
PAM signals select from uniformly spaced, bipolar
amplitudes scaled from amplitude levels -3, -1, 1,
3. Spectral efficiency in digital communication
systems is defined as the number of transmitted
information bits per second per unit of bandwidth,
i.e., the ratio of the data rate to the bandwidth.
Modulation systems with very high bandwidth
efficiency are employed in applications that require
high data throughput with small available bandwidth.
QAM and SSB provide bandwidth efficient modulation,
which can provide very low bit error rates when used
with high efficiency forward error correction codes
such as trellis coded modulation (TCM).
