<DESCRIPTION>
The frequency of infection associated with the 
use of invasive medical devices such as insertable as 
well as implantable devices is well documented. In the 
case of insertable devices such as catheters, the rate of 
infection necessitates frequent replacement. In the case 
of implantable devices such as prosthetic devices, 
infections interfere with adaptation to the device. In 
either case, life-threatening septicemia can result from 
such infections. The pathophysiology of medical device related 
infections is complex. Many factors influence the risk 
and type of infection. These include factors related to 
the host, to the medical device and to the virulence and 
inoculum of the infecting organism. Hundreds of medical 
publications have investigated and documented the 
variables that contribute to these factors. It has been 
well established that the overwhelming majority of 
medical device associated infections occur when bacteria 
colonize and then migrate along the medical device until 
they gain access to the bloodstream. Accordingly, the 
ability of bacteria to adhere to a medical device is 
important to the successful establishment of an 
infection. The role of bacterial surface polysaccharides 
in adherence is well established. Over 12 years ago a 
series of experiments demonstrated the ubiquitous nature 
of these polysaccharides. Surface polysaccharides are 
found on most bacteria and fungi. When confronted with a 
specific lectin, the surface polysaccharides generate a  
 
glycocalyx that surrounds the bacteria and adhering surface. The glycocalyx 
consists of a mass of long polysaccharide fibers and appears to have several 
functions. It may act as a source of nutrition for the bacteria. It may serve as a 
physical barrier. Most importantly, surface polysaccharides determine the specific 
surface interactions of the bacterial cell. This phenomena has far reaching effects. For example the ability of 
Streptococcusmutans to colonize teeth, Streptococcussalivarius to colonize gums, 
Bacteroidesfragilus to colonize the intestine, and Group A streptococci to colonize 
the throat and skin are all manifestations of a complex interaction between specific 
surface polysaccharides and specific lectins, which are proteins that bind to specific 
polysaccharides. The importance of bacterial surface and medical device related infections 
is best illustrated by coagulase negative staphylococci.S. epidermidis, the most 
important and common of the coagulase negative staphylococci, was previously 
consider
