<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amidinophenol
derivatives, processes for their preparation and
pharmaceutical compositions containing them.Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is an enzyme which acts on
phospholipids existing in cell membrane and hydrolyzes an
ester bond at the second position of the phospholipids.
There are known two kinds of PLA2, i.e.,
membrane-associated PLA2 and pancreatic PLA2.Membrane-associated PLA2 acts on phospholipids to
release arachidonic acid (AA) from the phospholipids. The
AA is converted into prostaglandins, thromboxanes and
leukotrienes, which are physiologically active substances
inducing various inflammatory diseases and allergic
diseases.On the other hand, pancreatic PLA2 degrades phosphoric
acid and destroys cell membranes, thereby producing
lysolecithin which has strong cytotoxicity. Recently, much
importance has been attached to pancreatitis, severity in
pancreatitis and multiple organ failure induced by such
destructive activity on cell membrane, and it has been more
remarkable. Further, it is reported that
membrane-associated PLA2 is also concerned with these
diseases.Accordingly, the inhibition of PLA2 leads to the
suppression of the release of AA, a precursor of various
physiologically active substances, and therefore, it is 
considered to be useful for the prevention and/or the
treatment of various inflammatory and allergic diseases.
Furthermore, it is considered to be useful for the
prevention and/or the treatment of pancreatitis, severity
in pancreatitis and multiple organ failure due to the
inhibition of destructive activity on cell membrane.Many compounds having an inhibitory activity on PLA2
are known. For example, there are known, as guanidino
containing compounds, guanidinobenzoic acid derivatives
such as camostat mesylate (code No. FOY-305) of the formula
(X) :

and nafamostat mesylate (code No. FUT-175) of the formula
(Y) :
 
(see Japanese Journal of Clinical Medicine, 48 (1),
165-172, 1990).Further, there are known compounds of the formula (Z):

(i) C1-4 alkyl,(ii) C1-4 alkoxy,(iii) carboxy,(iv) COOR4Z (in which R4Z is C1-4 alkyl),(v) halogen,(vi) nitro,(vii) sulfo,(viii) benzoyl, or(ix)
