<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to laminating adhesive compositions and, 
more particularly, to aqueous laminating adhesive compositions for wet lamination 
of substrates There is a constant effort in the adhesives art to develop aqueous laminating 
adhesive compositions for wet lamination of substrates, for example packaging 
materials, that provide improved adhesion without requiring the addition of volatile 
organic solvents. In accordance with the present invention there is provided an aqueous 
laminating adhesive composition for wet lamination of substrates, comprising: from 
40 weight percent to 65 weight percent solids dispersed in an aqueous medium, 
wherein the solids comprise: from 20 weight percent to 80 weight percent of a 
polymer having a glass transition temperature from -15°C to -40°C, and wherein the 
polymer is selected from the group consisting of acrylic polymers and vinyl ester 
polymers; from 2 to 20 weight percent of a plasticizer compound; and from 5, 
preferably from 20, weight percent to 50 weight percent of a tackifier compound. In accordance with the present invention there is also provided a method for 
making an aqueous laminating adhesive composition, comprising: adding a 
plasticizer compound and a tackifier compound to an aqueous emulsion of a 
polymer having a glass transition temperature from -15°C to -40°C to form a mixture 
thereof; wherein the polymer is selected from the group consisting of acrylic 
polymers and vinyl ester polymers; and agitating the mixture. In accordance with the present invention there is further provided a 
laminated article comprising a first substrate layer, a second substrate layer and an 
adhesive layer interposed between the first and second substrate layers and bonding 
the first and second substrate layers together, wherein the adhesive layer comprises 
the solids defined above; and wherein preferably the first and second substrates are 
independently selected from the group consisting of polymer films, papers, 
paperboards, wax-coated papers and wood. In accordance with the present invention there is also provided a method for 
making a laminated article wherein two substrate layers are bonded together by a 
dried layer of adhesive composition, comprising: applying a wet layer of the 
composition defined above to a first substrate layer; covering the wet layer of 
adhesive composition with a second substrate layer; and drying the layer of 
adhesive composition to form the laminated article.  Preferably the polymer is a vinyl ester
