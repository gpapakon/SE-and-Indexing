<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for soldering components to boards under the effect of a gas, with an at least two-part casing, in which there is a seal between the casing sections. It is proposed to use a liquid as the sealing agent. By this means it is possible immediately to offset mechanical stresses produced by thermal loads, thus preventing leaks in a simple manner.

<CLAIMS>
Device for soldering components onto boards under 
the influence of a gas, having a furnace area which is 

surrounded by a housing which is in at least two parts 
and in which a first housing part has at least one 

reservoir for a sealant into which a second housing part 
is partially immersed, the first housing part having a 

continuous wall region surrounding the reservoir, characterized 
in that the sealant is a liquid (32), in that the 

second housing part (26, 28) has a load-bearing part (26) 
and a sealing part (28) which surrounds the furnace area 

(34), the sealing part (28) surrounding the load-bearing 
part (26) in the region of the sealant (32), and in that, 

in the region of the liquid reservoir, the surrounding 
wall region (18) is designed with reinforcing means (14, 

16). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one transportation device (36) and one 

heating device (24) are arranged inside the housing (18, 
28). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that means (20, 38, 40) are provided which support the 

transportation device (36), are firmly connected to at 
least one part (14) of the first housing part and rest 

loosely on a further part (16) of the first housing part. 
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that means (22) are provided which support th
e heating 
device (24), are firmly connected to at least one part 

(14) of the first housing part and rest loosely on a 
further part (16) of the first housing part.
