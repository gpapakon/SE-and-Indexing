<ABSTRACT>
Silicon dioxide on a substrate is directionally etched using a hydrogen halide 
plasma which is created within an etch chamber. The method selectively etches 

silicon dioxide relative to polysilicon and silicon nitride. A substrate (18) and the 
combination of NH₃ and NF₃ gases or the combination of CF₄ and O₂ gases mixed 

with H₂ and N₂ gases are located within an etch chamber (16). A power source (26) is 
used to create an electrical field within the etch chamber causing the gas mixture 

(14) to form a plasma. The negative charge at the bottom of the chamber attracts the 
positively charged plasma, thereby etching the substrate in the downward direction. 

The result is an anisotropic product. The method is also shown to be effective in 
non-selectively etching thermal and deposited oxides, resulting in a similar etch rate 

for the different types of oxides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a surface processing technique of a silicon 
wafer substrate. Particularly, this invention relates to a technique for directionally 
removing or dry etching of an oxide film, using a plasma of NH₃ and NF₃ or CF₄ and 
O₂ mixed with H₂ and N₂. The exposure of a surface of a silicon (Si) substrate to ambient air causes a layer 
of native silicon dioxide (SiO₂) to form on its surface. The formation of the native SiO₂ 
layer presents certain manufacturing difficulties since many semiconductor processes, 
such as low-temperature epitaxy, polysilicon deposition, and silicidation, require the 
silicon wafer surface to be free of all native SiO₂. The prior art establishes that many 
different processes for etching or cleaning of the native SiO₂ from Si surfaces have been 
developed. One of the most commonly used techniques for etching SiO₂ is to expose the 
substrate to hydrofluoric acid (HF), either wet or dry. However, the use of liquid or 
vapor HF has major drawbacks for the semiconductor manufacturer because it is both 
highly toxic and highly corrosive. The high toxicity of HF requires the semiconductor 
manufacturer to implement safety procedures and devices which ensure that people and 
the environment are not injured by the HF gas. In addition, since HF is highly corrosive, 
it must be stored in containers and delivered to a cleaning or etch chamber in tubing 
which is resistant to corrosion. This type of equipment is generally more expensive than 
containers and tubing that do not possess anti-corrosive properties. It is also known in the prior art to selectively etch silicon dioxide using mixtures 
of fluorocarbon gases. However, this technique is also problematic due to the reaction  
 
inhibiting polymer which forms when the silicon or silicon nitride substrate is exposed 
to the fluorocarbon gases. In this technique, when oxide film is present, the oxygen in 
the oxide film prevents the formation of a reaction inhibiting polymer. However, once 
the oxide is etched through, the reaction inhibiting polymer can form and is deposited 
on the silicon or silicon nitride, inhibiting the etching of these films. The reaction 
inhibiting polymer film is difficult to remove from the wafer. The polymer film can 
also passivate the chamber wall and electrode surfaces and is a source of particles. 
Finally, the etch selectivity, in this process, is under 20:1 for SiO₂ relative to polysilicon 
or silicon nitride. The use of wet etching techniques, as described above, to
