<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to computer interface
control circuitry. More specifically, the present
invention relates to methods and apparatus for providing
a high speed, programmable interface circuit for use with
computers or other data or signal processing equipment.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications and
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional
fields in which the present invention would be of
significant utility.Computer interface control circuits are utilized to
connect an external peripheral device such as a tape
drive, disk drive, sensor device or the like to the
internal circuitry of signal or data processing
equipment. External peripheral devices often communicate 
with the signal and data processing equipment in
accordance with different protocols (e.g., data formats,
signal levels, framing of words, timing of bits, etc.).
Further, signal and data processing equipment often
support multiple external devices. Therefore, a computer
interface control circuit often must be reconfigured for
each external device that it is connected to. The
interface often also utilizes a different protocol from
that used by the interfaced circuits.Conventional computer interface control circuits
are typically implemented with either a hardwired logic
interface, a PROM based state machine interface or a
microprocessor controlled interface. A hardwired logic
interface is a special purpose, dedicated interface
circuit that typically exhibits a fast data rate.
However, a major disadvantage of the hardwired logic
interface is that it is not reconfigurable. The
hardwired logic interface enables communication between
the processing equipment and a particular external
device. However, it cannot be easily modified to permit
communication between the processing equipment and
another external peripheral device without time consuming
physical circuit changes. The hardwired logic interface
requires a different hardware logic design for each
change to the interface protocol.The PROM based state machine interface is also
designed to operate with a particular external peripheral
device. The PROM based interface has the disadvantage of
requiring that the PROM be reprogrammed or replaced in
order to reconfigure the interface to support
