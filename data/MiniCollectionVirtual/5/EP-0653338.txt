<ABSTRACT>
An anti-theft protection system for motor-driven vehicles is described; the said system includes:   a) an "immobiliser" control device with vehicle-specific identification number, b) at least one further control device with vehicle-specific identification number, c) a bidirectional connection line between the immobiliser control device and the further control device or devices, by means of which the identification numbers of the control devices have to be verified bidirectionally at least at each starting process.   Furthermore, an external data medium which can be read out only after a specific safety procedure has been run through and on which the identification numbers of the control devices are stored can be provided.

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating an anti-theft system for motor-driven
vehicles wherein


a) a vehicle-specific, secret identification number is
assigned to a control device containing the

immobilising function,
b) a vehicle-specific, secret identification number is
assigned to at least one further control device and
c) the vehicle-specific, secret identification numbers are
bidirectionally verified in accordance with a

bidirectional verification protocol executed via a
bidirectional connection line between the control

device containing the immobilising function and the at
least one further control device by linking the

vehicle-specific, secret identification numbers with
random numbers, at least upon each engine starting

procedure.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that an
external data carrier, readable only after the execution of

a special security procedure, is associated with the antitheft
system and the vehicle-specific identification numbers

of the control device containing the immobilising function
and the at least one further control device are stored on

the data carrier.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that
further control devices are associated with the anti-theft 

system and the further control devices are connected to one
another in the form of a network via bidirectional

connection lines.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the same identification number is

assigned to the control device containing the immobilising
function and the at least one further control device of the

vehicle.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that different identification numbers are

assigned to the control device containing the immobilising
function and the at least one further control device of the

vehicle, which identification numbers are in each case known
to the other control devices.
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that the data carrier is read in an

external diagnostic computer of a workshop and the vehicle-specific
identification numbers stored on the data carrier

are compared with the actual identification numbers of the
control device containing the immobilising function and of

the at least one further control device.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the communication between the data carrier and the

diagnostic computer is effected via an additional code
algorithm with an individual communications code. 
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 7,
characterised in that the vehicle-specific identification

numbers of the control device containing the immobilising
function and the at least one further control device are

stored in a mainframe computer of the vehicle manufacturer
and the data carrier is used as additional condition of

access to the mainframe computer.
A method according to Claim 8, characterised in that
the communication between the mainframe computer and the

control device containing the immobilising function and the
at least one further control device and/or the data carrier

is effected via an additional code algorithm with an
individual communications code.
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 9,
characterised in that the data carrier has the form of a

chip card.
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 9,
characterised in that the data carrier has the form of a

transponder.
