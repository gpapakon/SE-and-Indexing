<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an image-receiving sheet 
comprising a substrate sheet, an image-receiving layer 

and as a detection mark an opaque porous resin layer that 
can turn to be transparent upon heating, characterized in 

that the opaque porous resin layer is formed by coating a 
resin varnish comprising a resin, a good solvent having a 

relatively low boiling point and a poor solvent having a 
relatively high boiling point on the image-receiving 

sheet and drying the resultant coating. 
There is also provided an image-receiving sheet 
comprising a substrate sheet and an image-receiving 

layer, characterized in that the image-receiving layer is 
composed mainly of a polyester resin comprising an acid 

moiety and a diol moiety of a modified bisphenol A 
represented by the following general formula (I): 


wherein R represents an ethylene or propylene group and x 
and y are each an integer of 1 to 5, provided that the 

average of each of x and y is 1 to 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image-receiving sheet
for an overhead projector.An overhead projector (OHP) is an information
transmission means which is used extensively in lecture
meetings, schools, etc. Handwriting with an oil-base
ink, printing and electrophotographic copying have
hitherto been used as means for forming an image on an
image-receiving sheet for OHP (hereinafter referred to as
an "OHP sheet"). In order to steadily record and hold
thereon image information, such as lines, letters and
pictures, using the above means, OHP sheets generally
have an image-receiving layer on a transparent substrate
sheet. Therefore, the side of the image-receiving layer
in an OHP sheet, on which information is to be recorded,
should be surely distinguished from the other side of the
sheet. For this reason, a detection mark, for example, a
white arrow, for identifying the side of the image-receiving
layer, that is, distinguishing the two sides of
an OHP sheet is put on the sheet surface. This marking
also serves to mechanically distinguish an OHP sheet from
other types of paper.Further, some electrophotographic copying machines
are designed to begin work upon detection of the position
of the sheet within the machine at the time of copying,
which needs OHP sheets with a white detection mark formed
thereon.The above detection mark becomes unnecessary upon
the formation of an image. Rather, the presence of a
detection mark after the formation of an image on an OHP
sheet gives rise to the problem that when the OHP sheet 
is applied to an overhead projector, the detection mark
is unfavorably projected together with the necessary
image, so that the copresence of the unnecessary image on
the projected image face deteriorates the quality of the
projected image and sometimes makes it difficult to
clearly see the contemplated image.In view of the problem associated with the
detection mark, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 170944/1991
teaches a detection mark for an OHP sheet, comprising an
opaque porous resin layer that can turn to be transparent
when heated at the time of forming of an image by means
of electrophotographic copying. Proposed methods for
producing such a porous resin layer are 1) a method which
comprises incorporating a foaming agent during or after
coating of a hydrophobic resin, such as a polystyrene
resin or a polyester resin, on a substrate and conducting
foaming and 2) a method which comprises coating the
above-described hydrophobic resin together with an
extractable resin or solvent on a substrate and
