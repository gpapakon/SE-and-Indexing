<ABSTRACT>
During the storage or transmission of information in the form of information words, a recoding occurs in channel data words, e.g. by adding interrupt bit blocks to individual data words. When decoding such a data stream, a signal direct component is determined from the channel data words which serves as a decision threshold for differentiating between zeros and ones. A prior art method uses the interrupt bit blocks added to the data words for the purpose of bringing the signal direct component to a minimal value. In contrast to this method, the invention provides that a signal direct component deviating therefrom is obtained by appropriately selecting interrupt bits for the individual data words. It has namely been shown that the optimal decision threshold deviates from the decision threshold obtained according to a minimal signal direct component due to influences with regard to production techniques and due to the probability density of the occurrence of sequences of zeros and ones of different lengths. The optimal decision threshold can be, for example, empirically determined and correlated to the minimal signal direct component in order to supplement the data words with the interrupt bit blocks in such a way that when extracting the signal direct component from the transmitted or stored data, a modified decision threshold results and thus a reduced bit error rate.

A method for translating digital information data words into channel data
words 
(CW)
 by annexing a block 
(TR)
 from a set of merge bit blocks to a previous
information data word or by mapping an information data word onto one

channel data word from a subset thereof, in order to adjust a certain signal direct
component, for which purpose a set of candidates for channel data words

is formed from which a channel data word is selected according to a selection
criterion,

characterized by the following features:

a) the signal direct component to be adjusted is determined in accordance
with a mathematically and/or empirically found decision threshold 
(EST)

which is optimum in the sense that it leads to as few bit errors in distinguishing
"0" and "1" as possible in the course of the decoding of the

channel data words; and
b) the candidate is selected using the selection criterion that the selected
channel data word leads to a signal direct component in the sequence of

channel data words which comes closest to the signal direct component to
be adjusted which is different from the minimum signal direct component.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the difference is determined between


i) the signal direct component to be adjusted and
ii) the signal direct component 
(SG0)
 for the minimum digital sum value, i.e.
the value of the sum of zeros and ones in accordance with the two possible

signal levels, and

an increment rate 
(ZW)
 for the digital sum value 
(DSV)
 is determined according
to the formula


ZW = -K
-1
(EST-SG
0
)/A
max
 
where 
1/K
 is a proportionality factor which depends on the probability of occurrence
of the partial signal courses of different lengths, and 
A
max
 is the
maximum of the amplitudes of the signal courses which arise during decoding.
The method of claim 2, characterized in that a quantitatively maximum sum
value 
(DSV
max
)
 within a predetermined increment span (
m
max
) is fixed with reference
to the increment rate (
ZW
) of the signal direct component, corresponding
to the digital sum value, of the sequence of channel data words 
(CW),
 and
the candidates for the channel words are determined within an increment span

by forming the digital sum values of the corresponding signal data words for
the combinations of merge bits in question and therefrom the difference


(DDSV)
 with respect to the maximum sum value 
(DSV
max
).
The method of claim 3, characterized in that the selection criterion for the candidate
is the smallest difference.
The method of any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that those candidates from
the set of candidates are left out of account which in the NRZI format do not

correspond to a bit sequence which has at least 
d
 and at most 
k
 "0" bits between
two "1" bits 
(d, k
 condition).
The method of any of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the direct component

(EST)
 to be adjusted is calculated from the frequency distribution of the lengths
of consecutive zeros or ones.
A recording medium with an information structure consisting of sequences of
channel bit cells representing the channel data words 
(CW)
 formed by the
method of any of claims 1 to 6 and each containing one bit whose value "0" or

"1" is determined, by scanning the channel bit cells in a playback system, by
determining the signal direct component from the levels of the scanning signal

and ascertaining the presence or absence of level transitions at the beginnings
of the bit cells with the aid of said signal direct component, the sequences of

channel bit cells for bits with the value "0" and "1" being structured such that
the signal direct component deviates from the smallest possible signal direct

component. 
An apparatus for translating digital information data words into channel data
words according to the method of any of claims 1 to 6, having a device for selecting

from the possible candidates for a channel data word that candidate by
which the signal direct component occurring upon playback of the sequence of

channel data words deviates from the small possible signal direct component.
A converter for converting an analog signal to be recorded into the sequence of
channel data words with the apparatus of claim 8.
