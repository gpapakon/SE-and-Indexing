<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to track occupation 
warning systems for railway lines and has application, 
for example, to railway crossings, particularly for 
sections of track where there are no lineside cables 
available for the provision of telephones at such 
crossings. US-A-3740550 discloses a railway crossing signalling system using coded 
digital signals impressed on the tracks for actuation of a crossing 
relay, the presence of a train at the crossing location causing shunting 
of the signals and an indication from the relay.  
 Thus, to ensure it is safe to cross, 
particularly where the line of sight along the track is 
restricted, there is a need to warn prospective users 
if a train is imminent and thereby assure the user that 
it is safe to cross in the absence of a warning, e.g. 
for a safe crossing time of 20 secs for a train 
travelling at say 112 km/hr it would be necessary to 
warn a user if a train was within 640 metres of the 
crossing . The object of the invention is to provide a 
warning system which is particularly suitable for use 
at railway crossings and which can be adapted to other 
applications e.g. for trackside workers, or for train 
drivers. According to this invention a track occupation 
warning system comprises a master unit positioned at a 
predetermined position along a length of track, eg at a 
crossing, or signalling point, and a slave unit for 
each directional working of the track positioned along 
the track at a predetermined distance from said master 
unit, said master and slave units each being 
electrically connected to the running lines of the  
 
track, said master unit comprising operating means for 
initiating, generating and transmitting a predetermined 
series of pulses forming a unique encoded message to 
the or each slave unit via said running lines and first 
receiving means for receiving and verifying a response 
from the or each slave unit, and the or each said slave 
unit comprising second receiving means for receiving 
and verifying an encoded message from said master unit, 
and response means for generating and transmitting a 
response in the form of its own unique encoded message 
only if an encoded message from said master unit is 
verified by said second receiving means, the system 
being such that, if a vehicle is either closely 
approaching a slave unit, or is within the section of 
track between said slave unit and master unit, any 
encoded message from said master unit will be 
attenuated by the vehicle contact with the running 
bails
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A track occupation warning system comprising 
transmitter and receiver means (4, 6, 7) which, are spaced 

apart along a length of track (2) to be monitored, and 
which are electrically connected (at points 10, 11) via 

the running lines (3) of said track, wherein 
said transmitter and receiver means comprise a master 

unit (4) positioned at a predetermined position along said 
track, and a slave unit (6,7) for each direction of 

working of said track positioned at a predetermined 
distance from said master unit, wherein said master unit 

comprises operating means (16) for initiating, generating 
and transmitting a predetermined series of pulses forming 

an encoded message to the or each slave unit via said 
running lines and first receiving means (26) for receiving 

and verifying a response from the or each slave unit, and 
wherein the or each said slave unit comprises second 

receiving means (26S) for receiving and verifying an 
encoded message from said master unit, and response means 

(29) for generating and transmitting a response in the 
form of its own unique encoded message only if an encoded 

message from said master unit is verified by said second 
receiving means, the system being operative by vehicle 

contact with said running rails, if a vehicle is either 
closely approaching a slave unit, or is within the 

length of track between said slave unit and master 
unit, to attenuate any encoded message from said  

 
master unit sufficiently to prevent verification by said 

second-receiving means. 
A system according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
said operating means (16) of the master unit and response 

means (29) of the or each slave unit comprise an 
electrical circuit including an inverter (21, 21S) for 

generating via capacitors (24, 24S) different levels 
and/or states of impulse, and an encoder (20, 20S) 

controlling said positive and negative impulses and 
producing a predetermined series thereof, said series 

constituting a unique encoded message which is transmitted 
between the master and slave 

units via said running rails (3), each electrical 
circuit also including a decoder (22,22s) for verifying 

encoded messages received from said first or second 
receiver means (26, 26S). 
A system according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
said impulses are positive going and negative going. 
A system according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, for a length 
of track exceeding the normal working extent of the 

system, characterised in that further slave units (6, 7) 
are positioned along the track length, each with its own 

receiver and response means so that a message from the 
master unit (4) to the outermost slave units and response 

messages from the outermost slave units can be passed 
serially through the intermediate slave units via said 

running rails. 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the master unit (4) includes display  

 
means (23) which are connected to said first receiving 

means (26) so as to provide a visual indication to the 
user as to whether or not the track length is occupied by 

a vehicle. 
A system according to Claim 5, for a railway crossing 
or track-side application, characterised in that the 

master unit (4) is provided at the crossing or track-side 
position and a slave unit (6,7) is provided along the 

railway lines at a predetermined distance sufficient to 
provide a safe warning via said display means (23) of the 

approach or presence of a train, and in that the 
electrical circuit (16) of said master unit includes a 

switch for initiating the system. 
A system according to Claim 6, for a railway 
crossing, characterised in that said master unit (4) is 

provided on one approach to the crossing and a sub-master 
unit (5) is provided on the other approach to the 

crossing, and in that said sub-master unit is electrically 
linked to the master unit and has its own switch (28) for 

initiation by a user. 
A system according to Claims 1 or 2, for a signalling 
application, characterised in that slave units (6,7) are 

provided along the length of the track section to be

master unit is arranged to be initiated by a remotely 

operable switch in response to an infra-red or other 
remote signal, to be actuated by the train crew, or  

 
interrogated automatically by the train itself. 
A system according to Claim 8 and having a remotely 
operated switch, characterised in that said signal is 

directed via a track-side relay. 
A system according to any preceding claim and in 
which a number of slave units (6, 7) are associated with 

the master unit (4), characterised in that all but one of
