<ABSTRACT>
An improved printer apparatus (20) includes a 
print head having a series of point-like radiation 

sources (30), such as LED's, arranged in a row for 
exposing a recording medium (11). Enabling logic 

(43) is provided for determining which of the 
point-like radiation sources are to be selected for 

energization. A current driver responsive to the 
logic provides electrical current to the radiation 

sources selected. The current driver includes a 
current mirror having a master circuit (44a) for 

generating a reference current and a plurality of 
slave circuits (44b) for providing respective driver 

currents to the radiation sources selected for 
energization. The master circuit includes a series 

of parallel connected transistors (55) that may be 
instantaneously reprogrammed by digital control 

signals to said transistors. The characteristics of 
the transistors vary so that currents from them are 

scaled by say powers of two to provide an expanded 
current control capability. Environmental conditions 

and/or aging often require change in current to 
maintain desired recording performance. The need for 

such change may be automatically sensed and a new 
digital control word sent to the transistors to 

adjust current to the radiation sources.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to non-impact 
printing apparatus for recording on a moving 
photoreceptor or the like and a print-head for use 
therewith. In the prior art as exemplified by International 
Published Application (PCT) WO 88/07729, printer 
apparatus is described which comprises a multiplicity 
of individually addressable and energizable 
point-like radiation sources, such as LED's, arranged 
in rows for exposing points upon a photoreceptor 
during movement thereof relative to and in a 
direction normal to the rows. Driver circuits are 
provided for simultaneously energizing the radiation 
sources responsive to respective data bit input 
signals applied to the driver circuits during an 
information line period. The print or recording head 
includes a support upon which are mounted chips 
placed end to end and upon each of which are located 
a group of LED's. The driver circuits are 
incorporated in chips and located to each side of the 
linear array of LED chips. The driver circuits in 
this apparatus include a shift register for serially 
reading-in data-bit signals and for driving 
respective LED's in accordance with the data signals. Associated with each driver chip is a 
current-level controller that controls the level of 
current into the LED's of that group during 
recording. The controller comprises a current mirror 
having a master control circuit whose current is 
mirrored in slave circuits to which the LED's are 
connected. One advantage of this prior art printer  
 
apparatus is that current to the LED's may be changed 
automatically as needed, due to changes in aging or 
temperature of the printhead. As such changes affect 
the light output of the LED's, the changes to the 
current compensate for same so that some uniformity 
is provided to the recording apparatus. In the current mirror described in this prior 
art, the master control circuit (of which there are 
50 or more on a printhead) includes a transistor and 
an adjustable resistor. The resistor of each driver 
circuit is adjusted precisely and then permanently 
fixed during manufacture to provide the desired 
current to the respective LED's that are controlled 
thereby. This is a time consuming operation with 
attendant expense. After manufacture and during 
operation of the printer, automatic changing of 
current in a master control circuit is provided by 
adjusting voltage to the transistor as the resistor 
is now fixed. In order to change these voltages, 
additional circuitry is required to provide 
controlled analog
