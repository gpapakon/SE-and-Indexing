<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a long tubular
article
having a substantially uniform wall thickness, and
serving advantageously in the field of electric
electronic parts, automobile parts, and machine parts
and a method for the injection molding thereof. The
term "long" used herein specifically means the fact
that the ratio of the length (L) to the diameter (D)
equivalent to cross section (hereinafter referred to
as "equivalent diameter"), L/D, of the tubular article
under consideration is not less than 2 and the term
"equivalent diameter (D)" means the outside diameter
of the circle of the tubular article where this
tubular article is a cylindrical article having a
circular cross section. Where the tubular-article has
a triangular, tetragonal, or other similar angular
cross section instead of a circular cross section, the
equivalent diameter (D) is represented by the
following formula:
D = 4S/A
wherein S stands for the cross-sectional area defined
by the outer sides of the tubular article and A for 
the peripheral length of the outer sides of the
tubular article.The tubular articles, particularly such
long tubular articles as rolls and pipes (hereinafter
referred to simply as "tubular article"), which are
made of synthetic resins are now used in various
fields. Most of them are formed by the method of
extrusion. In recent years, the desirability of
producing rolls in such office machines as copying
devices and printers and pipes for machine parts in
decreased weights has been finding enthusiastic
recognition and the demands for tubular articles made
of synthetic resins and enjoying high dimensional
accuracy are growing.The extrusion molding, however, does not
easily obtain such dimensions as thickness and
diameter with high accuracy. It is proper to adopt
the injection molding method for the sake of high
dimensional accuracy. The injection molding method,
however, entails the following problems.The ordinary injection molding machine uses
an ejector pin for releasing a product from the mold
and this ejector pin operates in the same direction as
the direction of motion of the mold clamping mechanism
of the machine. The direction in which the tubular
article is disposed inside the mold, therefore, must 
be such that the direction of the central axis of this
tubular article may coincide with the direction of
motion of the mold clamping mechanism. Since the size
of the injection molding machine is desired to be
proportionate to the size of the formed product
thereof, the possibility that a tubular article
