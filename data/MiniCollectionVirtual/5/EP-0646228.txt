<ABSTRACT>
Combustion apparatus, e.g. for a gas turbine, has at least one catalytic combustion unit (14, 15, 16) having a plurality of through passages of which some are combustion passages (28) having a combustion catalyst on the passage walls and at least some others are bypass preheat passages (29) that are free of catalyst and are adjacent the combustion passages. A first gas stream containing air and fuel is supplied to the combustion and bypass preheat passages; catalytic combustion of the fuel occurs in the combustion passages (28) and heat is transferred through the passage walls to heat the gas in the bypass preheat passages (29). On emergence from the combustion unit (14, 15, 16) the preheated gas from the bypass passages (29) combusts in a downstream afterburn zone (20). A second gas stream containing air and a variable amount of fuel is supplied to the afterburn zone (20). Where there is more than one combustion unit, larger bypass passages (26) may be provided through the first combustion unit (14) so that part of the first gas stream passses through the first combustion unit (14) without preheating and mixes, in a zone (17) between the first and second combustion units (14, 15), with the gas from the combustion passages (28) and bypass preheat passages (29) of combustion unit (14) to form the gas stream fed to the second combustion unit (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catalytic combustion and in 
particular to a catalyst structure for use in a catalytic 
combustion process, for example as encountered in gas turbines. Catalyst bodies for use in such processes may comprise 
a structure, such as a foam or honeycomb, having through passages 
supporting, or composed of, a catalyst active for the combustion 
process. In any combustion process there may be used an assembly 
of one or more such catalyst bodies. In a catalytic combustion 
process a fuel/air feed, at a temperature below that at which 
autoignition takes place is passed, normally at superatmospheric 
pressure, typically in the range 2 to 40 bar abs., through the 
catalyst body assembly wherein combustion takes place giving a hot 
gas stream. The fuel may be gaseous or liquid at ambient pressure 
and temperature, but most, if not all, of the fuel should be in 
the gaseous state at the temperature and pressure at which the 
fuel lair mixture is fed to the catalyst body. Examples of 
suitable fuels include natural gas, propane, naphtha, kerosene, 
and diesel distillate. At least part of the fuel may be the 
product of subjecting a hydrocarhon feedstock to catalytic 
autothermal steam reforming. A process describing the use of 
catalytic autothermal steam reforming of a hydrocarbon feedstock 
to produce a gas turbine feedstock is set out in EP-A-351094. Catalytic combustion processes such as those encountered 
in gas turbine applications are normally operated, at least once 
the catalyst has "lit-off", at very high gas velocities and this 
presents problems in maintaining combustion. The gas leaving the 
catalyst body passages during normal operation desirably has a 
linear velocity in the range 25-150, particularly 50-100, m/s. As 
the flow rate is increased, the rate at which heat is lost from 
the catalyst surface to the gas increases. The rate at which fuel 
is transferred to the catalyst surface also increases as the gas 
velocity increases. Provided the catalyst is of sufficient 
activity to burn the fuel, the rate at which heat is released at 
the catalyst surfaces thus increases as the gas velocity  
 
increases. Thus, provided the catalyst is of sufficient activity, 
the rate of heat release and the rate of heat loss both increase 
as the gas velocity increases and so the catalyst surface 
temperature changes little, if at all. As the gas velocity is 
increased further, eventually a flow rate is reached where the 
reaction rate cannot be increased and becomes kinetically limited.

A combustion process comprising a) feeding a first gas stream 
containing fuel and air to a catalytic combustion unit (14, 

15, 16) having a plurality of through passages of which some 
are combustion passages (28) having a combustion catalyst on 

the passage walls and at least some others are bypass preheat 
passages (29) that are free of catalyst and are adjacent said 

combustion passages, whereby combustion of said fuel takes 
place in said combustion passages and heat is transferred 

through the passage walls to said adjacent bypass preheat 
passages thus preheating the air and fuel passing through 

said bypass preheat passages, and combustion of the fuel 
passing through said bypass preheat passages takes place 

downstream (17, 18, 20, 12) of said combustion and bypass 
preheat passages to give a hot combusted gas stream, and 

wherein, under normal running conditions, the amount of air 
in said first gas stream is maintained essentially constant 

and the amount of fuel in said first gas stream is controlled 
to maintain constant the temperature of the gas mixture of 

combusted gas from said combustion passages and the 
uncombusted gas from said bypass preheat passages of said 

catalytic combustion unit; b) adding a second gas stream (22, 
12) containing air to said hot combusted gas stream; and c) 

adding a variable amount of fuel (24, 25) to said second gas 
stream prior to addition thereof to said hot combusted gas 

stream, whereby increasing the amount of fuel added enables 
the combustion process to be varied from idling to full load 

operation. 
A combustion process according to claim 1 wherein air is 
compressed and part of that air is mixed with fuel (23) and 

fed as the first gas stream to said catalytic combustion unit 
and the remainder forms said second gas stream to which a 

variable amount of fuel (24, 25) is added.  
 
A combustion process according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein 
the amount of air in said second gas stream is constant. 
A combustion process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the catalytic combustion unit comprises at least two 

catalyst bodies (14, 15, 16) in series, each having 
catalyst-containing combustion passages (28) and 

catalyst-free bypass preheat passages (29) adjacent the 
combustion passages, and a mixing zone (17, 18) between each 

catalyst body, and at least the first catalyst body (14) has 
bypass means (26) in addition to its bypass preheat passages, 

whereby part of the first gas stream passes through the 
combustion and bypass preheat passages of the first catalyst 

body and the remainder of the first gas stream passes through 
said additional bypass means to the mixing zone (17) between 

a catalyst body (14) and the adjacent downstream catalyst 
body (15). 
A combustion process according to claim 4 wherein the ratio 
of bypass preheat passages (29) to catalyst-containing 

combustion passages (28) of one catalyst body (16) differs 
from that of another (14, 15) of said catalyst bodies. 
A combustion process according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
wherein each catalyst-containing combustion passage (28) is 

surrounded by catalyst-free bypass preheat passages (29). 
A combustion process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
wherein the catalytic combustion unit includes two or more 

catalyst bodies in series having through catalyst-containing 
combustion passages wherein the catalyst of an upstream 

catalyst body differs from that of a downstream catalyst 
body.
