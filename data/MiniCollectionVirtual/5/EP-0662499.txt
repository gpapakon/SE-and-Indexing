<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, and 
particularly to an ink suitable for use in recording on 
so-called plain paper such as woodfree paper, an ink-jet 
recording method using such an ink, and ink-jet recording 
instruments to which the ink is applied. It has heretofore been discovered that since 
polyamines such as polyethyleneimine act as cationic 
polyelectrolytes in an aqueous solution containing a dye 
and hence have affinity (weak bonding) for azo dye 
molecules having an anionic group such as a sulfonic 
group, and also have strong affinity (van der Waals' 
forces and hydrogen bond to cellulose, etc.) for recording 
media, they can improve the water fastness of inks used in 
ink-jet printers. For example, an ink disclosed in France Patent No. 
1480068 contains a polyethyleneimine having a molecular 
weight of 500 to 100,000. This polyethyleneimine contains 
a primary amine on its molecule. Most of direct dyes and 
acid dyes used in inks for ink-jet printers contain at 
least one azo bond. Now, such an ink has involved a  
 
problem that this azo bond is reduced by the primary amine 
of the polyethyleneimine molecule in the aqueous solution 
during the storage of the ink, and so the dye is 
decomposed to make the ink useless. On the other hand, 
the ink according to the present invention, which will be 
described subsequently, is similar to such an ink, but can 
retain its initial performance for a long period of time 
because the dye used therein is different from that of the 
France patent, and is not decomposed even after its 
storage. On the other hand, U.S. Patent No. 4,197,135 
discloses an ink composition having good water fastness, 
which comprises at least one water-soluble dye and a 
polyamine containing at least 7 nitrogen atoms in its 
molecule. According to this U.S. patent, both good water 
fastness and good ink storability can be achieved at the 
same time. However, the polyamine used is limited to 
polyamines containing no primary amine. Polyamines 
containing a secondary amine or a tertiary amine also have 
a sure effect on water fastness. However, their 
performance is somewhat poor compared with the polyamines 
containing a primary amine. Namely, the ink composition 
according to U.S. Patent No. 4,197,135 has not been said 
to completely satisfy the water fastness. Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,659,382 discloses an ink 
composition comprising a major amount of water, a  
 
hydroxyethylated polyethyleneimine polymer and a dye 
compound and having good water fastness, said
