<CLAIMS>
Pharmaceutical dosage form intended for ocular 
administration, characterized in that it is an insoluble 

solid tablet which possesses, from the inside to the 
outside: 


a matrix comprising at least one polymer and 
containing at least one active principle, 
a first layer of glycerides. 
Tablet according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it possesses, in addition, a second layer, forming 

a semipermeable outer membrane. 
Tablet according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the polymer used for the matrix is 

chosen from the group comprising the following polymers: 
polyethylene, acrylic polymer, polyvinyl chloride, 

cellulose derivatives of the HPMC type, polyvinyl 
alcohol, acrylic and methacrylic acid copolymers 

(Eudragit®) or mixtures thereof. 
Tablet according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the glycerides are natural or 

semisynthetic solid glycerides. 
Tablet according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the glyceride is glyceryl behenate (or Compritol®). 
Tablet according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the semipermeable membrane is 

formed from a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose, for 
example ethylcellulose. 
Tablet according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the active principle is chosen from 

the group comprising mydriatics, antibiotics and antiinflammatories.  
 
Tablet according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the active principle is present at 

a level of between 1 and 60%, the polymer of the matrix 
is present at a level of between 25 and 70%, and the 

glycerides are present at a level of 8 to 40%, relative 
to the total weight of the tablet. 
Tablet according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that it is between approximately 2.5 and 

4 mm in length and between approximately 1 and 3 mm in 
diameter. 
Process for preparing an insoluble tablet 
according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 

the following steps are performed: 

a) mixing of the active principle or principles with 
the polymer or polymers constituting the matrix, 
b) optionally, granulation of the mixture obtained 
after wetting and incorporation of adjuvants, 
c) addition of the glycerides and mixing, 
d) direct tabletting of the mixture obtained at the end 
of the preceding step. 
Process according to Claim 10 for preparing a 
tablet according to one of Claims 2 to 9, characterized 

in that, after step d), a step of coating the tablet with 
a thermoplastic derivative dissolved in an organic 

solvent is performed. 
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the coating is performed by dipping the tablets in 

a solution of ethylcellulose in an organic solvent, 
followed by drying in an oven. 
Use of a polymer matrix containing at least one 
active principle and coated with a layer of glycerides, 

for the manufacture of an insoluble solid tablet intended 
for ocular administration and capable of being easily 

removed from the eye after release of the said active 
principle or principles.
