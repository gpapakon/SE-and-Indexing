<ABSTRACT>
In a hydrocyclone the separation chamber (2) has a circumferential wall (3) provided with at least one turbulence creating member (12), which extends along the circumferential wall and crosses a helical path (10), along which a liquid stream is generated during operation. According to the invention, the turbulence creating member is formed by a set-off (12) on the circumferential wall (3). The set-off is formed and dimensioned such that said liquid stream substantially looses its contact with the circumferential wall, as the liquid stream passes the set-off. As a result turbulence is created in a layer of the liquid stream situated closest to the circumferential wall, without the liquid stream becoming any substantial flow component directed inwards in the separation chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrocyclone for 
separating a liquid mixture into a heavy fraction and a 
light fraction, comprising a housing forming an 
elongated separation chamber with a circumferential wall 
and two opposed ends, an inlet member for supplying the 
liquid mixture tangentially into the separation chamber 
at one end thereof, an outlet member for discharging 
separated heavy fraction from the separation 
chamber at the other end thereof, and an outlet 
member for discharging separated light fraction from the 
separation chamber. The hydrocyclone further comprises 
means for supplying the liquid mixture to the separation 
chamber via the inlet member, so that during operation a 
liquid stream is generated and passes along a helical path about a 
centre axis in the separation chamber, said helical path 
extending from the inlet member to said outlet member 
for heavy fraction, and at least one turbulence creating 
element in the separation chamber extending along the 
circumferential wall and crossing said path. In a known hydrocyclone of this kind according to 
US 4.153.558 there are four turbulence creating elements 
in the form of axial ridges on the circumferential wall. 
When such a ridge is passed by a liquid stream turbulence 
is created in a layer of the liquid stream located 
closest to the circumferential wall, which prevents 
growth of deposits on the circumferential wall. If 
growth of the deposits is not prevented during 
operation, the deposits might finally clog the outlet 
member for heavy fraction. However, the liquid stream will receive a 
component of movement directed inwardly into the separation  
 
chamber, when the liquid stream passes each ridge, which 
means that separated light fraction will contain a large 
amount of heavy components which were supposed to be 
discharged with separated heavy fraction. This is 
particularly a drawback when separating liquid mixtures 
constituted by fibre suspensions, which is 
explained more closely below. In the pulp and paper industry hydrocyclones are 
frequently used for cleaning fibre suspensions from 
undesired heavy particles. Thus, the fibre suspensions 
are separated into heavy fractions containing said 
undesired heavy particles and light fractions containing 
fibres. A typical hydrocyclone plant for this purpose 
has hydrocyclones arranged in several stages of hydrocyclones 
coupled in parallel (normally three or four 
stages), the hydrocyclone stages being coupled in series 
with each other. Separated heavy

A hydrocyclone for separating a liquid mixture into 
a heavy fraction and a light fraction, comprising a 

housing (1, 17), forming an elongated separation chamber 
(2, 18) with a circumferential wall (3, 19) and two 

opposed ends, an inlet member (6, 20) for supplying a 
liquid mixture tangentially into the separation chamber 

at one end of the separation chamber, an outlet member 
(8, 22) for discharging separated heavy fraction from 

the separation chamber at the other end of the separation 
chamber, an outlet member (7, 21) for discharging 

separated light fraction from the separation chamber, 
means (9) for supplying the liquid mixture to the 

separation chamber via the inlet member, so that during 
operation a liquid stream is generated and passes along a helical 

path (10) about a centre axis (11) in the separation 
chamber, said helical path extending from the inlet 

member to said outlet member for heavy fraction, and at 
least one turbulence creating element (12, 16) 

in the separation chamber extending along the circumferential 
wall and crossing said helical path, 
characterized 
in
that immediately upstream of the turbulence creating 
element (12, 26) in the separation chamber (2, 18) 

the circumferential wall (3, 19) has a smooth 
surface along a first zone (I) of the circumferential 

wall which is situated at a substantially 
constant distance from said centre axis (11) and extends around 

at least one fifth of the circumference of the 
separation chamber (2, 18), 
that the turbulence creating element is formed by an offset 
(12, 26) on the circumferential wall (3,  

 
19), which offset extends from said first zone (A) 

of the circumferential wall to a second zone (B) of 
the circumferential wall situated at a larger 

distance from the centre axis (11) than the first 
zone (A), the second zone (B) extending forwards 

from the offset, as seen in the flow direction of 
said liquid stream, and 
that the offset (12, 26) is so formed and dimensioned 
that during operation said liquid stream 

substantially loses its contact with the circumferential 
wall (3, 19), as the liquid stream passes 

the offset, whereby turbulence is created in a 
layer of the liquid stream situated closest to the 

circumferential wall, without the liquid stream 
receiving any substantial flow component directed 

towards said centre axis (11).

around at least one fifth of the circumference of the 

separation chamber (2, 18), the radial distance between the 
second zone (B) and the centre axis (11) decreasing

direction away from the offset (12, 26), as seen in the 

flow direction of said liquid stream.

characterized 
in
 that at the downstream end of said 

second zone (B), as seen in the flow direction of said 
liquid stream, the second zone (B) has substantially

axially consecutively arranged cylindrical chamber 
portions (23) so formed that the cross-sectional 

area of the separation chamber decreases stepwise
