<ABSTRACT>
In an interference cancellation apparatus for use 
in combination with a diversity receiving system, the 

apparatus includes first and second transversal filter 
means, first and second control means, third transversal 

filter means, third control means, decision means, first 
error producing means, and subtractor means which are 

operable as a first MMSE control loop for controlling 
first and second controllable tap gains and third 

controllable tap gains with reference to a first error 
signal. The apparatus further includes diversity 

combining means which are operable as a second MMSE 
control loop for controlling a combined signal with 

reference to a difference between the combined signal and 
a decision signal. An adaptive equalization and an 

interference cancellation are processed in parallel by 
the first and the second MMSE control loops, so that the 

control of the adaptive equalization and the interference 
cancellation can be converged at a high speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interference
cancellation apparatus, particularly to an interference
cancellation apparatus for use in cancelling interfering
waves and adaptively equalizing multi-path distortion,
when subjected to broad-band interfering waves on fading
diversity channels.In general, such an interference cancellation
apparatus is for use in combination with a diversity
receiving system which has a plurality of diversity
routes. The apparatus is operable as a decision feedback
equalizer (DFE) which is supplied with diversity
reception signals corresponding to the diversity routes
to produce an equalized signal.A conventional interference cancellation
apparatus comprises first and second transversal filters
each of which has a plurality of controllable taps and
which filter the first and the second diversity reception
signals into first and second transversal filtered
signals in accordance with first and second controllable
tap gains, respectively, first and second tap gain 
controllers for controlling the first and the second
controllable tap gains with reference to an error signal
and a distributed signal distributed in each one of the
taps in accordance with a predetermined adaptive
algorithm, third transversal filter which has a plurality
of taps and which filters a decision signal into a third
transversal filtered signal in accordance with third
controllable tap gains, third tap gain controller for
controlling the third controllable tap gains with
reference to the error signal and a distributed signal
distributed in each tap in accordance with the
predetermined adaptive algorithm, a decision unit for
detecting a level of the equalized signal to decide a
decision level for the equalized signal and to produce a
decision signal representative of the decision level to
supply the decision signal to the third transversal
filter, an error producing unit for producing the error
signal which is indicative of a difference between a
subtracted signal and the decision signal and which is
supplied to the first, the second, and the third tap gain
controllers, a subtractor for subtracting the third
transversal filtered signal from a combined signal to
supply the subtracted signal to the decision unit and the
error producing unit, and a diversity combination unit
for combining the first and the second transversal
filtered signals to produce the combined signal.Such a conventional interference cancellation
apparatus is disclosed in "MMSE Equalization of 
Interference on Fading Diversity Channels", Peter
