<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a composition 
to improve the adhesion properties 

of coatings on weathered exterior coatings. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to the 
use of a polymeric blend comprising a macromolecular aqueous 

dispersion, an acid-functional alkali-soluble resin and an 
aminosilane, in order to provide adhesion of coatings over 

difficult surfaces such as chalky substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition and a
method for improving adhesion of coatings to chalky
substrates.Water-based latex paints have found wide use and
acceptance in exterior applications. Water-based latex paints
have proven their exterior durability and toughness and,
because they are water-based, health, safety and environmental
concerns are significantly minimized relative to solvent-based
alkyd paints. However, water-based latex paints have inferior
adhesion over difficult surfaces such as "chalky substrates"
when compared to solvent-based alkyd paints.Chalky substrates result when the latex paint degrades
from exposure to rain and sunlight. The degradation process
causes pigments and extenders, such as titanium dioxide and
aluminium silicates, to become unbound and to appear on the
painted surface as a dusty white chalk. Solvent-based alkyd
paints continue to out-perform water-based latex paints over
these substrates because of their ability to wet, penetrate
and adhere to chalky substrates.JP 03-064305A discloses an aqueous silane-modified
macromolecular dispersion composition for improving the wet
adhesion of adhesives and paints to glass which consists of a
carboxyl group-containing water-soluble resin, a
macromolecular aqueous dispersion and a water-soluble silane
coupling agent containing an amino group. The carboxyl group-containing
water-soluble resin has an acid number of 30-800
and the amount compounded are per 100 solid parts by weight of
the macromolecular aqueous dispersion, 0.2 to 2.0 parts by
weight of the water-soluble resin and 0.1 to 3.0 parts by
weight of the amino group-containing silane coupling agent.US-A-4,340,524 discloses an acrylic resin latex-based
sealant composition with improved water resistance and wet
adhesion to glass and aluminium which comprises introducing 
about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent of a hydrophobic resin
dissolved in about 2 to about 20 weight percent of a liquid
organic, non-coagulating, non-gelling solvent into the acrylic
resin latex together with an aqueous solution of about 0.5 to
about 5.0 weight percent of a hydrolyzed organoaminosilane
containing sufficient base to maintain a pH of at least 8.5.PCT WO 92/14788 discloses a composition that provides
quasi-crosslinked, alkali-soluble polymeric surface coatings
which includes an acid-functional vinyl polymer and an amino-functional
siloxane, in which the vinyl polymer has at least
two acid-functional pendant moieties and in which the siloxane
polymer has at least two amino-functional
