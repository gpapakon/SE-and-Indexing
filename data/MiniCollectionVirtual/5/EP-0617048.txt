<ABSTRACT>
A method for performing capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) of protein and 
peptide analytes with fraction collection for the purpose of post separation 

analysis is disclosed. Use of this method provides a large amount of 
sample which can be separated and recovered on a porous substrate while 

preserving the separation efficiency. The large amount of collected sample 
components may easily be subjected to further analysis such as protein 

sequencing and amino acid analysis. The cIEF method is conducted by a 
capillary electrophoresis (CE) system which includes a fused silica 

capillary, a high voltage power supply, an electrolyte reservoir at one end 
of the capillary and a porous substrate at the other, means for injecting a 

sample, and a detector. In carrying out the method, a protein-containing 
sample is mixed with suitable ampholytes and loaded into the capillary. 

Subsequent application of the high voltage results in the formation of a pH 
gradient along the length of the capillary, and more slowly, the migration 

of the protein analytes to their isoelectric point. The discrete focused zones 
of analyte are then eluted onto a porous substrate using the bulk fluid flow 

(electroosmotic flow) or other mobilization techniques associated with the 
operation of the system. The collected samples become bound to the 

porous substrate and may then be subjected to further analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
Capillary electrophoresis (CE) and capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) are 
well known separation methodologies which have become techniques of 
great interest for the separation and analysis of proteins and peptides. 
These techniques offer the benefits of high resolving power, rapid 
separations, ability to analyze very small volumes of sample, and a 
desirable simplicity from the point of view of the apparatus required when 
compared to competing analytical techniques such as gel electrophoresis 
and liquid chromatography. The benefits mentioned above derive to a large extent from the use of 
narrow diameter capillary tubes, which permit efficient removal of the 
heat generated in the separation process and prevent convective mixing 
which would degrade the separating power. The narrow diameter tubes 
also allow high voltages to be used to generate the electric field in the 
capillary while limiting current flow and hence heat generation. A CE 
separation begins by filling the capillary with an electrolyte. Next, a small 
amount of sample is injected into one end of the capillary. Typical sample 
injection volumes range from 1-20 nanoliters. After sample injection, a 
high voltage is applied to the capillary and the sample components are 
separated based on their charge/mass ratio. In addition, a bulk fluid flow, 
called electroosmotic flow, moves all components, regardless of charge, 
through the capillary and generally in a direction that moves them past an 
appropriate detector such as a UV detector. Isoelectric focusing is a well known technique for producing high 
resolution separation of proteins and peptides which originated in gel 
electrophoresis separations. Over the past years several investigators have 
shown that isoelectric focusing can also be used as a mode of protein 
separation using the same hardware as that used for CE separations 
(Methods Vol 4, pp 1-8, 1992), and the acronym, cIEF, has been adopted to 
describe this mode of separation. In protein separation, cIEF has been 
chosen as an analytic technique because of its high resolving power and 
fast analysis time. As generally practiced, the method mixes the sample 
with ampholytes, a mixture of small molecules having a heterogeneous  
 
range of isoelectric points, at a concentration of between 2 and 5%. The 
separation capillary is then filled with the mixture prior to the application 
of the high voltage. This means that 1-2 microliters of sample are loaded 
into the capillary, in contrast to the nanoliter sample loading
