<ABSTRACT>
In a wavelength division optical transmission system incorporating 
optical amplifiers, an identifying pilot tone is modulated on to each 

multiplexed wavelength. Each system amplifier determines from the 
pilot tones the total number of wavelengths being transmitted and 

thereby provides a corresponding adjustment of the amplifier gain. 
This prevents overamplification when one or more wavelengths is 

missing from the multiplexed signal e.g. as the result of a transmitter 
fault.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical transmission systems, and in
particular to systems in which transmitted signals are wave division
multiplexed.Wave division multiplexing (WDM) is being introduced as a means
of increasing the traffic handling capacity of optical fibre
transmission systems. In a WDM system each individual fibre
carried signals at a number of wavelengths, typically four. When
these signals are transmitted over long distances, periodic
regeneration of the signals is necessary. Currently, this
amplification is generally effected by demultiplexing the different
wavelengths and then converting the light signals to corresponding
electrical signals. These electrical signals are regenerated and then
reconverted to light signals.In an effort to reduce equipment costs, attempts have been made to
replace the optoelectronic regenerators with optical amplifiers, e.g.
erbium fibre amplifiers. Such amplifiers have the advantage both of
relatively low cost and the ability to amplify all the wavelengths
without the need for demultiplexing.A wavelength multiplexed optical communication system having a
gain control arrangement for a control signal is described in
specification No. EP-A-0 467 396. The control signal comprises an
additional signal to, and at a different wavelength from, the
information carrying signals. In most single wavelength optically amplified transmission systems,
each optical amplifier is arranged to provide a substantially constant
total mean power output to ensure that transmission quality is
maintained. Attempts to introduce amplifiers of this type to WDM
systems have not proved successful. The basic problem is that of
determining the appropriate amplification factor of an amplifier from
the input signal power. Current signals measure the total input
power irrespective of wavelength. If all the multiplexer wavelengths
are present at the input of an amplifier then an appropriate
amplification factor can be determined. However is one or more
wavelength is missing from the input signal, e.g. under fault
conditions, this causes a corresponding drop in the total input
power. To compensate for this power drop the amplifier increases
its gain and this amplifies the remaining wavelength with an
effectively increased gain factor resulting in too high an output
power from these wavelengths. For example, temporary loss of
three wavelengths in a four-wavelength WDM system can result in a
6 dB increase in the power output of the remaining wavelength.
This can incur serious penalties arising
