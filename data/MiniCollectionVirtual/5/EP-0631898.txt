<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an electronic display unit wherein a motor driving 
portion including a CPU and a driving IC controls a drive current to a motor 

(11) so that the motor (11) initially rotates at a low speed and subsequently 
rotates at a high speed to switch the speed of rotation of a case (3) from a low 

speed to a high speed, whereby operability is ensured if a rotation control 
switch is disposed on a front surface of the case (3), preventing conventionally 

increased size of the unit as well as alleviating user's feeling that rotation 
requires too much time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic display unit such as a 
navigation system mounted in an automotive vehicle. In the past, an automotive navigation system which is an electronic display 
unit has been adapted such that a motor is driven by operating a control switch 
provided on a front surface thereof and the rotation of the motor is transferred 
by gears to a unit body which in turn rotates through a predetermined angle. The motor is controlled to rotate at a constant speed and, accordingly, the 
unit body rotates at a constant speed. The reason for rotating the unit body as above described is that it is 
necessary to effectively utilize, in particular, the rear space of this type of unit 
body which is commonly embedded in a center console within the automotive 
vehicle. The unit body is required to be minimized in size in terms of layout 
of the unit body itself. However, a display screen of an LCD and the like is 
not permitted to be very small in size in order to ensure visibility. The prior art navigation system rotates at a constant speed as above 
described. Rotation at a very high speed is disadvantageous in that, as soon as 
the control switch on the front surface of the unit body is operated, the unit 
body starts rotating to strike user's fingers. For this reason, so high speed of  
 
rotation is impractical, resulting in some users feeling that the rotation requires 
too much time. One approach for ensuring the operability of the control switch independent 
of the speed of rotation of the unit body is to provide an additional non-rotatable 
control panel on which the switch is disposed. The provision of such 
a control panel increases the entire size of the display unit. As above stated, 
it is necessary to avoid the increased size of the unit body since it is disposed 
in the center console. In addition, the entire size reduction is required while the 
size of the display screen of the LCD is sufficiently ensured. For these reasons, 
the control switch is required to be disposed on the front surface of the unit 
body.  
 Document JP-A-03 138 711 relates to a display which is 
tiltably attached to a fixed support element. Two two-level 
switches, one for upward movement and the other for downward 
movement of the display via a motor-driven tilt mechanism, 
are arranged on the fixed support element and allow the tilt 
of the display with two different speeds, respectively. A 
disadvantage of such a kind of displays is that the provision 
of the switches at the fixed support

<CLAIMS>
An electronic display unit including a support box element (1) fixed to a 
fixing member, and a unit body (3) having a display and rotatably supported by 

said support box element (1), said electronic display unit comprising: 

a motor (11) housed in said support box element (1); 
a control switch (6) provided on a front surface of said unit body (3), said control 
switch (6) being operated to selectively rotate said motor (11) either in a regular 

direction or in the reverse direction; 
rotation transfer means (20) for transferring the rotation of said motor (11) to said 
unit body (3) to rotate said unit body (3) through a predetermined angle until the 

regular rotation of said motor (11) causes the unit body (3) to be substantially horizontal 
and the reverse rotation of said motor (11) causes the unit body (3) to be substantially 

vertical; and 
a motor driving portion (27) housed in said support box element (1) for supplying 
a drive current to said motor (11) either in a direction of the regular rotation or in 

a direction of the reverse rotation by operation of said control switch (6), said 
motor driving portion (27) controlling said drive current such that said motor (11) rotates 

at a low speed during the time interval between start of rotation and rotation at 
a predetermined angle and subsequently rotates at a high speed. 
The electronic display unit of claim 1, wherein said rotation transfer 
means (20) includes: a worm (12) attached to a rotating shaft of said motor (11); a worm 

wheel (13) in meshing engagement with said worm (12); a first gear (14) coaxial with said 
worm wheel (13); a second gear (15) mating with said first gear (14); a third gear (16) mating with  

 
said second gear (15); a fourth gear (17) coaxial with said third gear (16); a fifth gear (18) mating 

with said fourth gear (17); and a sixth arcuate gear (19) formed in said unit body (3) and 
mating with said fifth gear (18). 
The electronic display unit of claim 1, wherein said motor (11) is a DC 
motor, and said motor driving portion (27) feeds a pulse-shaped drive current to said 

motor during the time interval between start of rotation and rotation at said 
predetermined angle and subsequently feeds a constant drive current to said 

motor (11). 
The electronic display unit of claim 1, wherein said display includes a 
liquid crystal display. 
The electronic display unit of claim 1, wherein said fixing member is 
a structure member of a center console (SC) provided within an automotive vehicle.
