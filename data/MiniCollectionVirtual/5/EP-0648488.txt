<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a treatment method for modifying the growth of hairs and/or the hair, which consists essentially in administering to the body, topically and/or systemically, substances chosen from lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase inhibitors or stimulators, the aforementioned administration preferably being carried out in combination with the supply (simultaneous, separate or spread over time) to the body, topically and/or systemically, of at least one substrate or at least one substrate precursor of lipoxygenases and of cyclooxygenases. Depending on the substances chosen, it is possible either to promote the growth and/or limit the loss of the aforementioned hairs and/or hair (use of lipoxygenase inhibitors and/or of cyclooxygenase stimulators), or, on the contrary, to decrease or prevent the growth of these latter (use of lipoxygenase stimulators and/or of cyclooxygenase inhibitors). The invention also relates to various compositions which can be used for implementing the method.
