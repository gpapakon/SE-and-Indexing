<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the disposal of articles of manufacture, by which are to be meant, above all, electrical and electronic appliances and components, especially commodities and capital goods of the consumer and production sector. According to the invention, the disposal method and the disposal system provide the arrangement of electronic data carriers with falsification-proof, individual identification data on each article of manufacture, this allowing a specific assignment of an article of manufacture, delivered to the disposal points, by means of evaluation units. Used for preference as electronic data carriers are transponders, the permanently programmed identification data of which contain information on the manufacturer and/or the specific disposal programme. Efficient control and cost allocation are guaranteed by means of a combined data network and at least one computer.
