<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning method in which 
the object of cleaning is immersed subsequently in tanks 
containing cleaning liquid. Moreover the invention relates to 
a cleaning apparatus for performing this method. In particular the present invention relates to a method of 
cleaning metal products and components, for example aluminum 
precision parts such as head and photosensitive drum of video 
tape recorder (VTR), mainly for the purpose of degreasing, as 
it is known from DE-A-41 36 816. Hitherto, aluminum precision parts such as VTR head and 
photosensitive drum were cleaned by immersion ultrasonic 
cleaning or vapor cleaning by using chlorofluorocarbons and 
trichloroethane as cleaning fluid. However, chlorofluorocarbons 
and trichloroethane are ozone layer destroying 
substances, and their use is regulated, and they are being 
replaced by organic solvents such as methylene chloride and 
methanol (see the Japanese Laid-open Patent No. 3-144459 or 
DE-A-39⊘1986). Besides, a degreasing cleaning apparatus using 
water-based detergent such as alkali or surface active agent 
has been also developed. Chlorofluorocarbons and trichloroethane are thus restricted, 
and methylene chloride and other organic solvents are harmful 
for human health and also involve problems in safety of work 
such as explosiveness. Water-based detergents have side effects such as discoloration 
of the work surface, and it is extremely difficult to remove 
detergents by rinsing. The water-based detergent can easily 
remove oil chemically (wettable in water) and clean, but it 
causes difficulties in the separation of the cleaning liquid 
into oil and water after cleaning. Therefore, in cleaning by 
using such water-based detergents, waste water treatment is 
huge in scale, requiring a wide area of installation and a  
 
high facility cost. Accordingly it is the object of the invention to provide a 
cleaning method, which is free from side effects such as 
discoloration of the workpiece surface, is harmless to 
environment and allows disposal of the cleaning liquid with 
comparatively few installation and facility costs. This object is solved by a cleaning method comprising 
a step of immersing the object of cleaning first in washing 
water without detergents contained in a first tank to wash 
roughly by bubbling from beneath or by water jet, and 
showering with purified water from above when lifting the 
object, a step of immersing the object treated in the first tank in 
washing water without detergents in a third
