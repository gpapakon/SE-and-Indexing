<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is comprised in the technical
field of the production of compounds with antitumoral activity.Specifically, the present invention refers to the
obtainment of new areno indols, useful in the synthesis
of hexahydroareno [e] cidopropa [c] indol-4-ones with antitumoral
properties.Obtaining phenantrenes by oxidative photochemical
cycling of stilbenes is a synthetic method largely used
as can be seen in the review of F.B. Mallory and C.W.
Mallory in Organic Reactions, Wiley: New York, 1984;
Vol. 301 page 1. The analogous reaction of oxidative
photocycling of 1-aryl-2-pyrrilethylenes (II) to produce
areno [e] indols (III) is less described in the bibliography,
in spite of its unquestionable potential.
The reason is that this reaction tends to give very small
yields and is highly dependent on the substrate. This
small yield is often due to the oxidative decomposition
in the reaction medium of the 1-aryl-2-pyrrolylethylenes
(II) as starting products. A solution to this problem
consists of the use of carefully studied reaction conditions
to give the best yields in a given substrate.
Hence, for example, M.P. Cava et al. in J. Org. Chem.,
56, 2240 (1991) and cited references have carried out
these oxidative cyclings on some 1-aryl-2-pyrrilethylenes
(II), irradiating them with ultraviolet light in the
presence of palladium on carbon, silica-gel, triethylamine
and p-nitrobenzoic acid in acetonitrile to reflux
and an inert atmosphere, with very good yields. These 
good yields are obtained however as a result of a laborious
search for reaction conditions which end up being little
versatile; furthermore, these conditions may end up
to be technically complex to use.
On the other hand, the areno [e] indols (III) are intermediates
useful for preparing hexahydroareno [e] cyclopropa-[c]
indol-4-ones (IV). These indolones have a great pharmaceutical
interest as they contain the structural unity
of cyclopropa [c] indol-4-one which, among others D.L. Boger
et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113, 2779 (1991) have proven
that it is responsible for the antitumoral activity of
the CC-1065 agent (V) and synthesis analogues of the same.
The object of the present invention is to solve the
problem raised in the preparation of areno [e] indols (III)
by photochemical irradiation in the presence of oxidants of 1-aryl-2-pyrrolylethylene
(II).The problems associated with the photochemical cycling
of 1-aryl-2-pyrrilethylenes (II) are solved in this invention
by preparing compounds of general structure (IX)
wherein the double
