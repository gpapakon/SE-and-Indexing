<CLAIMS>
Thermal printer with line-head comprising a plurality of
heating printing elements (2) arranged in order to print

successive lines of dots on a printing support moved against the
head (1), heating elements being, through the intermediary of

memory points (6; 46) of a printing register (5; 45), controlled
by individual activation means (7, 8), which printer is

characterised by the fact that the memory points (6; 46) are
arranged in order to be individually deactivated one by one by

the addressing means (10; 40).
Printer according to Claim 1, in which the writing
addressing means comprise a demultiplexer (10; 40) for addressing

memory points (6; 46).
Printer according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in which the
printing register (5; 45) comprises an input (9) for controlling

the forcing of memory points (6) into the same predetermined
state.
Printer according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which means
(31; 41; 47, 48, 49, 51) are provided for controlling the writing

addressing means (40) arranged to receive at the input signals
respectively representative of the intensities of grey of the

dots to be printed.
Printer according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which means
(31) are provided for controlling the writing addressing means

(10) and the activation control means (7, 8) comprise a
connection (8) connected to the memory points (6) of the register

(5).
Printer according to one of Claims 4 and 5, in which the
addressing and activation control means (31; 41) are arranged to

simultaneously manage the regulations of the duration of heating
of several printing elements (2). 
Printer according to one of Claims 4 to 6, in which
reading addressing means (42, 49, 51) are provided arranged for

reading, in an input memory (43; 48), a predetermined number of
activation bits at an active state of a line to be printed and

the means (51; 52) for controlling the writing addressing means
(40) are arranged in order to select said activation bits under

the command of the reading addressing means (42, 49, 51) and for
controlling the transfer of said activation bits, from the input

memory (43) to the printing register (45).
Printer according to Claim 7, in which a counter (51) is
provided for controlling the reading addressing means (42) and

the writing addressing means (40) simultaneously.
