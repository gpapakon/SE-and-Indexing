<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention relates to optical
methods of chemical analysis.Chemical analysis involving the detection and quantization
of light occurs in a large variety of situations. One
application of this need is the detection of analytes for
the determination of the presence or amount of a particular
analyte. In many assays for analytes, one is concerned with
either absorption or emission (e.g., fluorescence or
chemiluminescence) of light. In many situations, one
irradiates a sample with light and then attempts to detect
the effect of the sample on the transmitted or emitted
light. In the case of emitted light resulting from
irradiation, non-analyte molecules may also emit light
resulting in a relatively large background noise, which
results in the introduction of substantial error in the
measurement of the effect of the sample on the light. There
are also additional systematic errors which collectively
contribute to the noise associated with the measurement.The quality of chemical measurements involving light can be
defined in terms of the ratio of a suitable measure of the
optical signal from a sample due to the presence of analyte
to the noise variation inherent within the signal. In
general, efforts to augment this signal to noise (S/N) ratio 
have centered on improving the sensitivity of a measurement
apparatus so as to reduce the "detection limit" associated
with a particular analyte. The detection limit refers to
the analyte concentration within a sample above which the
signal attributable to the presence of analyte is such that
a desired S/N ratio is achieved. In practice, this
detection limit is ascertained by conducting an experimental
procedure designed to elicit an optical signal related to
analyte concentration. Specifically, data relating to
signal and noise intensity are plotted in the form of a
calibration curve for a range of analyte concentrations,
thereby enabling straightforward determination of the
detection limit.The determination of concentration in unknown samples is
effected by comparing the signal obtained experimentally
from the unknown with the calibration curve. A typical unit
of concentration in chemical measurements is moles/liter
[i.e., Molarity (M)], where a mole is defined as Avogadro's
number (6.0225 x 1023). Unfortunately, even the most
sensitive conventional experimental techniques have
detection limits on the order of about one femtomolar (fM),
or nearly one billion analytea per liter.Measurements in which concentration is determined by
