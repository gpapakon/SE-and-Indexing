<ABSTRACT>
An inkjet printer comprises a printer unit (10) and a paper feed unit (50). Printer unit (10) is 
provided with the following: a carriage (12), an inkjet cartridge (11) mounted om the carriage 

and having an inkjet head (11a), that performs printing by ejecting ink towards a print medium; 
and a drive mechanisms (15, 16, 17, ...) for reciprocating carriage (12). The carriage and the 

drive mechanism are located either at the rear of or below inkjet head (11a). Paper feed unit 
(50) is provided with a mechanism for feeding the recording paper and is secured onto the 

recording head side of printer unit (10) on a detachable basis. The inkjet printer is capable of 
easily printing various print patterns on various recording materials, such a slip printing, in 

addition to normal printing which is performed by feeding a recording material that is relatively 
soft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inkjet printer and, more particularly, to an inkjet printer capable of
slip printing."Slip printing" as the term is used here, refers to printing on relatively rigid print media like
thick paper or cardboard, etc., that cannot be or should not be transported through a curved
feed path. Thus, slip printing is contrasted by what will be called "normal printing" here, i.e.
printing on flexible or pliant print media like ordinary paper.US-A-4,920,258 discloses an inkjet printer suitable for normal printing only. The known inkjet
printer comprises, mounted to a common frame, an inkjet unit, a carriage on which the inkjet
unit is mounted, a carriage drive mechanism, and paper feed means including a platen disposed
opposite the inkjet unit and feed rollers that transport recording sheets between the inkjet head
and the platen through a bent feed path.A printer dedicated to slip printing and not capable of normal printing is disclosed in JP-A-39270/1991.A printer suitable for slip printing and normal printing is disclosed in US-A-4,375,923.
This
known printer has combined in one machine plural print stations of which one is designed for
slip printing. Except for being an impact dot printer using an ink ribbon, this prior art has a very
complex and bulky structure making it rather expensive.Generally, slip printing can be performed by either of the thermal transfer method, the wire-dot
method and the inkjet method. However, the inkjet method is best suited for slip printing for
the following reasons:
(1) Both the thermal transfer method and the wire-dot method require an ink ribbon
between the print head and the print medium, and the structure needed for mounting and
transporting the ink ribbon increases the complexity of the printer. Further, the ink ribbon tends
to stain the print medium unless special means are provided to avoid it. By contrast, in an
inkjet printer the ink is stored in a cartridge, and this makes the structure simple. Although
there is a risk of ink dripping that could result in staining the print medium, this problem can be
easily prevented by keeping the ink in an ink bag in the cartridge at an appropriate negative
pressure. (2) As a general rule, the wire-dot method requires an accurate adjustment of the gap
between the front end of the print head and the print medium. The size of this gap determines
the impact force by which the wire-dots press the ink ribbon against the print medium.
Because the print density largely depends on the impact force, the gap must

An inkjet printer comprising:

a printer unit (10) including

a frame (13),
a carriage (12) slidably supported on the frame (13),
an inkjet cartridge (11) mounted on the carriage and having an inkjet head (11a), and
a drive mechanism (15, 15a, 16-20) for reciprocating said carriage, and
a paper feed unit (50, 50', 50'') having a paper feed mechanism (51, 52, 53; 52', 53';
52a, 52b, 53a, 53b) for feeding print media to be printed by said inkjet head (11a),
characterized in that
 said drive mechanism is located either at the back of or below the

inkjet head (11a) such that the nozzles of the inkjet head are immediately at or next to a front
end of the printer unit, and
said paper feed unit (50, 50', 50'') is detachably mounted to said front end of the
printer unit (10).
The printer of claim 1 wherein a guide surface (13a) for rigid print media (60) is
provided on the printer unit (10) said guide surface being exposed when the paper feed unit is

detached and defining a plane extending in front of and spaced by a predetermined gap from
the nozzles of the inkjet head (11a).
The printer of claim 2 wherein said guide surface (13a) is formed by the front side
of a front plate (133) of said frame (13) said front plate also serving as a flange plate for
