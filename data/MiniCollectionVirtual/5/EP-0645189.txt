<ABSTRACT>
Mill which operates by rolling raw materials intended for the production of ceramic products between two cylindrical hoops, of the type including two counter-rotating cylindrical hoops (1, 2) each being borne by two bearings (3 or 4), it being possible for the bearings of one of the hoops (4) to slide in a slideway (7) under the action of one or more hydraulic rams (12), while the bearings of the other hoop are immobilised, at least one movable wedge being interposed between the two pairs of bearings (3, 4), the device being characterised by the fact that the wedges are variable-thickness wedges, each consisting of two parts (11a-11b), each part (11a-11b) having one face (13, 14) bearing against a bearing (3, 4) and an oblique face (16, 15), the two oblique faces being parallel and bearing against each other; one of the parts (11b) of the variable-thickness wedge (11) being fixed and the other (11a) movable so that its oblique face (16) slides along the oblique face (15) of the fixed wedge such that the geometric position of all the bearing faces (13, 14, 15) is always the same when the thickness of the wedge varies.

<CLAIMS>
Mill for the rolling of the raw materials intended for the manufacture of
ceramic products, of the sort comprising two counterrotating cylindrical hoops (1.2)

borne by bearings (3, 4), each of the cylindrical hoops (1,2) being borne by bearings
(3 or 4); the said bearings (3, 4) comprising first bearings (3) which are kept

immobilised and second bearings (4) which are capable of sliding within a slideway
(7), wherein:


at least one shim (11) of variable thickness is interposed between a said first
bearing (3) and a said second bearing (4) to control the distance between the two

rolling hoops (1, 2);
each shim 11 is composed of a part (11a) which is mobile in a transverse
direction to the slideway, and of another part (11b);
each part (11a or 11b) of the shim has a flat face (13 or 14) perpendicular to
the axis of the slideway (7) and an oblique face (16 or 15) parallel to and leaning

against the oblique face (15 or 16) of the other part (11b or 11a) of the shim;
characterised in that: the bearings (4) capable of sliding are subjected to the thrust of

one or more hydraulic piston-cylinder units (12); each mobile part (11a) is suitable for
vertically sliding its oblique face (16) along the oblique face (15) of the other part

(11b) of the shim; and the hoops (1, 2) may be brought closer together by vertically
raising each mobile part (11a) of the shim.
Mill for the rolling between two cylindrical hoops of raw materials intended
for the manufacture of ceramic products according to claim 1, characterised in that the

position of the support surfaces of the faces (13, 14, 15, 16) is determined such that
the support surfaces are substantially symmetrical with respect to the horizontal plane

containing the axes of the shafts (1a, 2a) of the hoops (1, 2), so that the efforts are
always symmetrically distributed.
Mill according to claim 1 or 2, wherein an additional shim (20) may be
arranged between the vertical face (14) of the stationary part (11b) of the shim and the

corresponding bearing (4). 
Mill according to claim 3, wherein the thickness of the additional shim (10)
is equal to the distance travelled by the bearings (4) of the mobile hoop (2) between

the bottom position and the top position of the mobile part (11a) of the shim (11).
Mill according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the physical
characteristics of the shims (11) are determined such as to compensate for the thermal

expansion of the hoops (1, 2) in order to maintain a constant milling distance.
Mill according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it
comprises an electrical device for detecting that each shim (11) remains in contact

with its support, which said device is capable of stopping the motorisation control of
the cylinders.
Mill according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the bearings (3)
are kept immobilised leaning against a vertical wall (7a) of the slideway (7) by means

of stops (10).
Mill according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the immobilised
bearings (3) are kept leaning against the shim (11) directly by the stops (10).
