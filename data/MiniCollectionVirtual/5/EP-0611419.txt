<ABSTRACT>
It is described an actuator driven by a diaphragm (7), contained in a body (2), that when pressurised by a fluid, acts directly on a flapped axis (4), forcing it to move angularly, yielding a rotation transmitted to a part or equipment to which is coupled, being possible the return to initial neuter position, to be effected by the pressurisation of a second diaphragm placed in the same body, or means of a spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Descriptive report of an invention patent of "Actua tor for Rotatory movemen t driven by hydrauli c or pneumatic fluid".The invention herein refers to an actuator, driven hyάrauiically or pneumatically, aiming on yield a rotation movement in a part or equipment.The actuator is characterised for possessing a flexible diaphragm, contained inside a body where, when pressurised by a fluid, the diaphragm acts directly upon a flap attached to an axis, forcing it dislocate angularly, rotating and transmitting this movement to the part or equipment when operated.The systei.i of the presented actuator possesses an advantage, turning it different from the others, for it possesses a diaphragm acting directly on the flapped axis, dismissing mechanisms that transform the diaphragm dislocation into rotation of the actuator axis, being consequently its construction more economical and simple.The actuator, according to the invention herein, was developed with th= finality to transmit a rotation _τ.ove-.=nc to a part cr equipment, as for example, valves, where frequently iε necessary to act "at distance" through ti:c use of pressurised fluid. 

 - -The actuator now analysed, may be used with the most different parts or equipments, being sufficient that the axis end and its attaching systems bear the necessary adaptations as to their coupling to the part or equipment to be operated.The return of the axis angular movement to its initial neuter position, may be accomplished by using a second diaphragm installed in the body inner part or by means of the distortion of an elastic part, for example, a spring.The invention herein may be more easily understood in the following description, read together with the annexed sketches, in which:Figure 1 represents an actuator lateral plane view in neuter position.Figure 2 represents an actuator frontal plane view in neuter position.Figure 3 represents an actuator superior plane view in neuter position.Figure 4 represents an actuator superior plane view in operated position.Figure 5 represents an actuator section AA' view in neuter position. 

 Figure 6 represents an actuator section AA' view when operated.Figure 7 represents a section view with the actuator in neuter position with the return accomplished by the action of a second diaphragm.Figure 8 represents an actuator lateral plane view with spring return, when operated.Figure 9 represents an actuator superior plane view with spring return, when operated.In the diverse figures of annexed sketches, the identical reference numbers

Claims
1. "ACTUATOR FOR ROTATORY MOVEMENT DRIVEN BY HYDRAULIC OR PNEUMATIC FLUID" - aimed to yield a rotation movement to a part or equipment to which is coupled, characterised by possessing a body, in which inner part, a diaphragm (7) when pressurised by a fluid, acts directly on a flapped axis (4) , forcing it to rotate, transmitting this movement to the part or equipment to be operated.
2. "ACTUATOR FOR ROTATORY MOVEMENT DRIVEN BY HYDRAULIC OR PNEUMATIC FLUID" - according to claim 1, characterised by possessing a flapped axis (4) , that after being operated by the diaphragm (7) , may return to initial neuter position by means of a pressurisation of a second diaphragm (10) set in the same body interior .
3. "ACTUATOR FOR ROTATORY MOVEMENT DRIVEN BY HYDRAULIC OR PNEUMATIC FLUID" - according to claim 1, characterised by possessing a flapped axis (4) , that after being operated by the diaphragm (7) , may return to initial neuter position by the action of a spring (11) .
