<ABSTRACT>
Shelf construction system, comprising bar-shaped square hollow-section elements and star-shaped assemblage-point elements having two to six pins which protrude away from one another and are received in the hollow sections for the purpose of forming shelf space structures. The pins (12) of the assemblage-point elements (10) are formed as cylinders with an external diameter (D) which is slightly larger than the internal dimension (B) of the hollow-section elements (11). Formed on the pins (12) are two or four flat portions (30-34) which are diametrically opposite and distributed uniformly over the circumference and are, in pairs, at a distance (A) from one another which is slightly smaller than the internal dimension (B) of the hollow-section elements.
