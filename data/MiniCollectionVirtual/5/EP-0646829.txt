<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display provided with an optically compensatory sheet.As a display for electronic office system-devices such
as a desk-top personal computer and a word processor for
Japanese language, CRT (cathode ray tube) has been employed
so far. Recently, a liquid crystal display (hereinafter
referred to as LCD) is increasingly employed instead of the
CRT because of its thin thickness, light weight and low
power consumption. LCD generally has a structure that a
liquid crystal cell is disposed between a pair of polarizing
sheets. Most of LCD use a twisted nematic liquid crystal.
Operational mode of LCD using the twisted nematic
liquid crystal is roughly divided into birefringence mode
and optical rotatory mode.A super twisted nematic liquid crystal display (hereinafter
referred to as STN-LCD) utilizing the birefringence
mode uses a super twisted nematic liquid crystal showing a
twisted angle of more than 90 degrees and having steep
electro-optical characteristics. Such STN-LCD, therefore,
has an advantage of giving display of a large capacity by
driving in time-sharing mode. However, the STN-LCD has
disadvantages such as slow response (several hundred milliseconds)
and difficulty in giving satisfactory gradation on
display, and therefore its display characteristics are
relatively poor, as compared with display characteristics
of a liquid crystal display using the known active-type
elements (e.g., TFT-LCD and MIM-LCD). In the TFT-LCD and MIM-LCD, twisted nematic liquid
crystal showing a twisted angle of 90 degrees is employed
for displaying an image. This is called LCD of an optically
rotary mode (i.e., TN-LCD). TN-LCD display mode shows fast
response (several tens of milliseconds) and high display
contrast, and easily gives black-white display of high contrast.
Hence, the optical rotatory mode has a number of
advantages compared with the birefringence mode or other
modes. However, TN-LCD has disadvantages that color or
contrast on display varies depending upon viewing direction
to a liquid crystal display, and its display characteristics
are not comparable to display characteristics of CRT.In order to improve the viewing angle characteristics
(i.e. to enlarge the viewing angle), arrangement of a phase
difference film (optically compensatory sheet) between a
pair of polarizing plates and TN liquid crystal cell has
been proposed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publications
No. 4(1992)-229828 and No. 4(1992)-258923.The phase difference films proposed in these
