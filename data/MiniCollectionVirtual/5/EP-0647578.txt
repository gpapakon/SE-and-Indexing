<ABSTRACT>
The retaining element (38) is moved out of a rotary disc in the plane of the latter and holds the bottle (10'), to be held by the rotary conveyor, essentially only at one point (T). The retaining element can be provided with an easily exchangeable finger part (39) and thereby allows rapid and simple adaptation to different bottle sizes. Since the retaining element swings out towards the bottle, without touching the latter during the swing-out movement, there is no risk of damage to the bottle.

<CLAIMS>
Carousel conveyor with more than one outlet and with a 
plurality of retaining elements for selective retention of 

conveyed containers, said retaining elements being arranged 
in at least one plane of the carousel and executing a movement 

essentially in said plane perpendicular to the axis of 
the carousel in order to retain or release the container, 

characterized in that each retaining element (38; 40'; 53, 
54) comprises a sliding part and an exchangeable retaining 

finger (38, 39') releasably attached thereto, which is the 
foremost part of the retaining element and the only component 

of the retaining element that is specific to the size of 
the containers, and in that the carousel conveyor also has a 

basic element that is independent of container size and an 
upper and a lower star-wheel (17, 18) that are both size-specific.

characterized in that each retaining element (38; 40'; 53, 
54) comprises a sliding part and an exchangeable retaining 

finger (38, 39') releasably attached thereto, which is the 
foremost part of the retaining element and the only component 

of the retaining element that is specific to the size of 
the containers, and in that the carousel conveyor also has a 

basic element that is independent of container size, an 
upper star-wheel (17'') that is independent of container size 

and is adjustable in height, and a lower star-wheel (18) 
that is size-specific.  

 
Carousel conveyor according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the retaining element contacts the retained 

container essentially only at one point. 
Carousel conveyor according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the retaining element has a straight 

sliding part (53) which is radially displaceable in a guide 
with respect to the axis of the carousel and a retaining 

finger (39) pivotably arranged thereon, which is guided by a 
cam (56) upon displacement of the sliding part so that it 

contacts the container, or moves away from the container as 
the case may be. 
Carousel conveyor according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the sliding part is secured in the guide by means of 

friction dampers (58). 
Carousel conveyor according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the retaining element (38) has an arc-shaped 

rigid sliding part with a retaining finger (39) 
arranged thereon. 
Carousel conveyor according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the retaining element (40') has a 

flexible sliding part displaceable in a guide, with a retaining 
finger arranged thereon. 
Carousel conveyor according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the retaining elements are individually 

opened or closed by control vanes (24, 25) which are 
arranged below the plane of the carousel and coupled with 

the retaining elements, and the said control vanes revolve 
with the carousel and can be shifted to strike stops (22) 

which may be controllable or fixed, and which are fixed with  
 

respect to the machine, thus imparting movement to the retaining 
elements. 
Bottle inspection apparatus with a carousel conveyor 
according to any one of Claims 1 to 8.
