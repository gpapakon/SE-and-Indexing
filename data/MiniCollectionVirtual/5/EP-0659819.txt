<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flame-retardant
thermosetting resin composition containing a non-halogen type
flame-retardant. More particularly, it relates to a flame-retardant
thermosetting resin composition having high water
resistance and excellent mechanical properties which
contains, as a non-halogen type flame-retardant, (1)
melamine-coated ammonium polyphosphate particles and/or (2)
water-insoluble ammonium polyphosphate particles.Thermosetting resins such as epoxy resins, urethane
resins and phenolic resins possess excellent heat resistance
and mechanical strength and have therefore been used
extensively, for example, as a molding material for electric
and electronic parts, constructional materials and automobile
parts, a coating, an adhesive, and an impregnating resin for
impregnated paper. Flame retardation of these thermosetting 
resins has been achieved generally by addition of a halogen-containing
organic compound or by halogenating part of the
polymer chain. However, halogen-containing thermosetting
resin compositions generate a corrosive halogenous gas on
combustion, which has given rise to a problem. Ammonium
polyphosphate has been proposed as a halogen-free flame-retardant,
but it is very susceptible to hydrolysis because
of its chemical structure so that molded articles obtained
from a resin composition containing ammonium polyphosphate
suffer from eluation or bleeding of the ammonium
polyphosphate under a high temperature and high humidity
condition. It has also been pointed out that compounding of
such an inorganic compound as ammonium polyphosphate leads to
reduction of mechanical properties of the resin composition.
It has therefore been demanded to develop a flame-retardant
thermosetting resin composition containing a flame-retardant
which produces no halogenous gas on combustion, is not
eluted, does not bleed out, and causes little reduction in
mechanical characteristics of the resin.In order to meet the demand, a resin composition
containing a metal hydrate as an inorganic flame-retardant
has been proposed as disclosed in JP-A-3-190965 (the term
"JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese
patent application"), in which the metal hydrate undergoes an
endothermic decomposition and dehydration reaction at the
combustion temperature of the resin composition thereby 
suppressing combustion of the resin composition. However,
since the flame retarding effect of the metal hydrate is very
weak, desired flame retardation cannot be achieved unless it
is used in a large
