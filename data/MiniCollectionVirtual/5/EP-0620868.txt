A process for ionizing material vapors generated 
thermally at reduced pressure, wherein the material 

vapors are exposed to electrons from the cathode spots 
(6) of a self-consuming cold cathode (3, 4), the thermal 

vaporization device (7) being connected as an anode, so 
that a vacuum arc discharge forms between cathode (3, 4) 

and anode (7), which process is characterized in that the 
evaporation rate of the vaporization device (7) is 

determined by the energy supply from the supply unit (9), 
while the ionization is determined by the arc current 

flowing through the arc between cathode (4) and 
anode (7). 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the plasma stream emerging from the cathode spots is 

shielded from the thermal vaporization device (7) by a 
wall (10) surrounding the cathode. 
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the plasma stream is directed onto the shielding 

wall (10). 
The process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the wall (10) is connected as an auxiliary anode. 
A device for operating the process according to claims 1 
to 4, wherein in a vacuum chamber (1) there is arranged 

a cathode holder (3) that can be cooled, having the 
cathode material (4) applied thereon for generating 

cathode spots on the self-consuming cold cathode, a thermal 
material vaporization system (7, 8, 9) connected as 

an anode, a wall 10 surrounding the cathode and connected  
 

as an auxiliary anode, which wall has an opening opposite 
the cathode. 
The device according to claim 5, characterized in that an 
ignition device (5) is arranged at the cathode. 
The device according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that there is arranged in the vacuum chamber (1) a 

material (11) to be coated with the ionized material 
vapor.
