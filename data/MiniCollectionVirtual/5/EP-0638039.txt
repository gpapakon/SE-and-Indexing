<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vertical and longitudinal force sensor for use in a fifth wheel hitch. The sensor comprises a beam (5, 6) and transducers (18, 19) for measuring the horizontal and vertical deflections at true centre of the beam. The beam comprises two outer parts and an inner part which serves to actuate the transducers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FIFTH WHEEL COUPLINGThe invention relates to a vertical and longitudinal force sensor for particular, but not exclusive, use in a fifth wheel hitch.The tractor vehicle used as the towing unit of an articulated vehicle combination is fitted with a hitch, known as a fifth wheel hitch, to connect it to the trailer it is to haul. Trailers for such vehicles are known as semi-trailers because they possess only one axle system, positioned at the rear. The load on the front part of the semi-trailer is supported by the fifth wheel hitch, from where it is fed into the tractor vehicle structure and thence to the tractor vehicle axles.It is known to connect trailers and/or semi-trailers together so that more than one may be towed by a single vehicle. In such a case the trailers are connected by fifth wheel hitches or alternatively by dolly bars to which fifth wheel hitches are mounted.In order for the fifth wheel hitch to operate it is designed to transmit all three components of the tractor/semi-trailer coupling force, comprising those due to vertical load, lateral cornering and longitudinal traction and braking, but to transmit only the roll moment of the corresponding moment set. Pitch and yaw moments are not transmitted across the hitch, thereby permitting the two parts of the vehicle combination to adopt differing pitch and yaw angles, as required for traversing undulating terrain and -.negotiating corners, respectively. 

 A sensor operating at the fifth wheel hitch should be capable of measuring the vertical and longitudinal forces between the tractor unit and semi-trailer of an articulated vehicle combination. This must be done without undue influence from other forces and moments present, and without compromising the basic overload capacity and long term durability of the hitch or its mountings.The physical environment in which a fifth wheel hitch operates is extremely harsh yet, being a 'safety critical' component, it is required to operate under conditions of severe abuse and neglect without sudden failure.A sensor designed as part of the main plate assembly is not feasible because the loading regime in that case is complex and variable, depending as it does on lubrication, plate flatness, and trailer tolerances amongst other things, and also because different hitch designs would require different sensor designs.Likewise a sensor in the region of the main plate pivot, either on the plate or the support would be required to be developed in different forms for different hitch designs. It should also be

CLAIMS
1. A sensor comprising a beam (5, 6) and transducers (18, 19) for measuring the horizontal and vertical deflections at the centre of the beam, characterised in that the beam comprises three components, two outer parts, and an inner part which serves to actuate the transducers.
