<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a transistor
switching circuit and is particularly directed to a switching
circuit according to the preamble of claim 1. According to the
present invention a symmetrically configured switching cell
shall be provided for coupling one of high and low voltage
inputs to an output terminal with minimum delay and
symmetrical rise and fall characteristics of the switched
voltage waveform.The GB-A-2 002 985 discloses a switching circuit having first
and second input terminals for receiving a first and a second
voltage, first and second controllable current sources connected directly to an
output terminal, and first and second voltage relay circuits,
connected to the output terminal without any feedback,
operative to selectively couple the first voltage and the
second voltage to the output terminal, respectively. Each voltage relay
circuit contains two switched diode circuits.Automatic test equipment (ATE) manufacturers employ pin driver
circuits for controllably applying respective high and low voltages
to an output terminal to which a device under test is coupled.
Figure 1 schematically illustrates the basic components of a
commercially available pin driver circuit employed in an ATE system
manufactured by Fairchild Corporation, in which first and second
diode bridge circuits 11 and 13 are respectively coupled between a
high voltage VH input terminal 15 and an output terminal 20, on the
one hand, and between a low voltage VL input terminal 17 and the
output terminal 20, on the other hand. The capacitance associated
with output terminal 20 is shown in the figure as a capacitive load
21. Switchably coupled to opposite ends of each diode bridge are
respective current sources 22 and 24.When it is desired to couple the high voltage input VH at
terminal 15 to output terminal 20, controlled switching elements
27, 28 are operated to steer each of current sources 22, 24 to
diode bridge 11, while diode bridge 13 for the low voltage VL is
electrically isolated from the current sources. The high voltage VH 
at terminal 15 is thus coupled to output terminal 20 through diode
bridge 11. Conversely, when it is desired to couple the low voltage
input VL at terminal 17 to output terminal 20, controlled switching
elements 27, 28 are operated to steer each of current sources 22,
24 to diode bridge 13, while diode bridge 11 is electrically
isolated from the current sources. The low voltage VL at terminal
15 is thus coupled to output terminal 20 through diode bridge 13.Because it can be
