<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a bearing for a shaft or a journal with no clearance, a rolled bearing bush (1, 100) is described having a non-circular (2) shape obtained by suitable shaping adjusted in such a way that, on being inserted into the bush drilling (45, 145), the bush (1, 100) is shaped with the at least partial withdrawal of the deformation to such an extent that part of its outer surface espouses the wall of the drilling (45, 145). Here, in at least part of the sections where the outer surface (10, 110) of the bush (1, 100) does not bear on the wall of the drilling, inner surface (20, 120) of the bush (1, 100) bears on the journal (30, 130) or the shaft. The butt ends (3, 103, 4, 104) meeting at the joint (7, 107) taking the form of straight peripheral sections (5, 105, 6, 106) can project outwards owing to suitable shaping. By suitable shaping the bush can also be given a polygonal shape.

<CLAIMS>
Bearing bush (1, 100) of elastic material as a 
bearing for a journal (30, 130) or shaft for insertion 

into a housing bore (45, 145), wherein the bearing bush 
(1, 100) has a shape which, due to purposeful 

deformation, deviates from the circular shape (2) and the 
deformation is such that the bearing bush (1, 100) has in 

peripheral direction alternately a region of smaller 
diameter and a region of larger diameter so that it may 

bear with a part of its outer surface (10, 110) onto the 
surface of the housing bore (45, 145) and with at least a 

part of the portions, where the bearing bush (1, 100) 
cannot be made to bear with its outer surface (10, 110) 

onto the surface of the housing bore (45, 145), the bush 
may bear with its inner surface (20, 120) onto the 

journal (30, 130) or the shaft, characterised in that the 
bearing bush is a wrapped bearing bush (1, 100) whose 

butt ends (3, 103, 4, 104), which are formed as straight 
peripheral portions (5, 105, 6, 106) which meet at the 

joint (7, 107), project due to purposeful deformation so 
far outwardly relative to the circular shape (2) that, 

on being inserted into the housing bore (45, 145), the 
bearing bush (1, 100) may bear with at least half of its 

outer surface (10, 110) with interference fit and an area 
contact onto the surface of the housing bore (45, 145). 
Journal or shaft connection comprising a first and a 
second component, wherein the first component carries a 

bearing bush pressed into a housing bore and the second 
component is connected to a journal or shaft housed in 

the bearing bush, characterised in that the bearing bush 
is a wrapped bearing bush (1, 100) which has a shape 

which is obtained by purposeful deformation and deviates 
from the circular shape (2), the deformation being such  

 
that when the bearing bush (1, 100), which is preformed 

with butt ends (3, 103, 4, 104) formed by straight 
peripheral portions (5, 105, 6, 106) meeting at the joint 

(7, 107), is pressed into the housing bore (45, 145) it 
is deformed, with at least partial withdrawal of the 

deformation, to such an extent that it bears with at 
least half of its outer surface (10, 110), with 

interference fit and an area contact forming bearing 
surfaces (13, 113, 114, 115), onto the surface of the 

housing bore (45, 145) and with at least a part of 
the portions where the bearing bush (1, 100) does not 

bear with its outer surface (10, 110) onto the surface of 
the housing bore (45, 145) bears with its inner surface 

(20, 120) on the pin (30, 130) or on the shaft, and that 
the bearing bush (1, 100) is situated in the first 

component (40) such that the maximum radial force F of 
the second component (50) acting on the bearing bush (1, 

100) engages in the region of an outer bearing surface 
(13, 113, 114, 115). 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the deformation is such that the 

maximum spacing between the outer surface (10, 110) of 
the bearing bush (1, 100) and the surface of the housing 

bore (45, 145) is 
<
 5/100 mm. 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the maximum spacing is 
<
 1/100 mm. 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the radial force F engages the 

bearing surface (13) opposite the joint (7). 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 2 or 
5, characterised in that the butt ends, which are formed  

 
as straight peripheral portions (5, 105, 6, 106) and meet 

at the joint (7, 107), project due to purposeful 
deformation so far outwardly relative to the circular 

shape (2) that, on being inserted into the housing bore 
(45, 145), the bearing bush has an outer bearing surface 

which amounts to at least half of its outer surface (10, 
110). 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 2 or 
5, characterised in that the bearing bush (100) has a 

polygonal shape obtained by purposeful deformation whose 
outer bearing surfaces are situated in the region of the 

polygon edges [points]. 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the polygon edges [points]

161, 162) are so situated that one polygon edge [point]
 
lies in the region of the butt ends (105, 106). 
Journal or shaft connection according to claim 7 or 
8, characterised in that the bearing bush (100) has a 

polygonal shape with three polygon edges [points] (160, 

161, 162). 
Journal or shaft connection according to any one of
