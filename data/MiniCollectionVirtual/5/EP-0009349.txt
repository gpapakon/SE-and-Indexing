<ABSTRACT>
An electrical cartridge fuse connector comprises two 
housing members (1, 2) adapted to be screw-threaded 

together to contain a cartridge fuse (100) and two termi­
nals (11) each having a socket portion receiving an end of 

the fuse (100) and a conductor-connection portion (14) 
to which a conductor (200) can be connected without the 

use of tools. A conductor (200) connected to either of the 
terminals (11) leaves the housing (1, 2) by way of an axial 

hole (6, 10) in the end wall (5, 9) thereof and the terminal 
(11) is provided with a portion (18) which prevents trap­

ping of the conductor (200) between the terminal (11) and 
the housing end wall (5, 9).
