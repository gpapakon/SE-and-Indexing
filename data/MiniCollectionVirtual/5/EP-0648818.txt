<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a pigment 
composition comprising, as an effective ingredient, a 

strontium borate compound of the general formula (I): 

nSrO · mB₂O₃ · xH₂O   (I)
where O 
<
 n ≦ 3, O 
<
 m ≦ 4, O ≦ x ≦ 5;
 

   a pigment composition comprising particles of a strontium 
borate compound whose surfaces are coated with SiO₂ and a 

method of producing the same; and
 

   processes for imparting anti-corrosive, anti-bacterial 
and/or anti-fungal, and non-flammable properties to materials 

by using the above pigments. 
The above strontium borate pigment compositions are 
excellent in anti-corrosive, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and 

non-flammable properties, and yet are atoxic. In addition, 
since they are white, they realize a desired coloration of a 

material. Particularly, the pigment comprising particles 
coated with SiO₂ is excellent in water resistance as well as 

being excellent in the aforesaid properties. 
Each of the processes is highly safe, and allows the 
materials to possess every property above-mentioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pigment 
compositions having excellent anti-corrosive, anti-bacterial, 
anti-fungal and non-flammable properties, methods of making 
the same, and processes for imparting anti-corrosive, anti-bacterial 
and/or anti-fungal and non-flammable properties to 
materials by utilizing the properties of the aforesaid pigment 
compositions. Conventionally, anti-corrosive paints containing an 
anti-corrosive pigment have been used for the corrosion 
prevention of a base material such as one made of iron. The Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) specify 
eight kinds of anti-corrosive paints which differ depending on 
the kind of anti-corrosive pigments contained therein. Among 
those, six kinds of the anti-corrosive paints contain 
chromium-based or lead-based anti-corrosive pigments. The 
chromium-based anti-corrosive pigments specified in JIS 
include zinc chromate (ZPC type and ZTO type) and the like, 
and the lead-based anti-corrosive pigments include minium, 
lead suboxide, basic lead chromate and the like. The above anti-corrosive pigments have superior 
anti-corrosive properties and therefore have been widely used. 
They, however, contain either chromium or lead which is  
 
harmful if absorbed into human bodies. Recently, there has 
been a growing demand for a pollution-free anti-corrosive 
pigment being free from such harmful substances. Examples of the conventionally known anti-corrosive 
pigments which contain neither chromium nor lead, include 
phosphate-based pigments such as zinc phosphate and aluminum 
phosphate, and molybdate-based pigments such as zinc molybdate 
and calcium molybdate. However, no anti-corrosive pigments 
having superior anti-corrosive properties comparable to 
that of the chromium-based or lead-based anti-corrosive 
pigments, are yet to come in practice. A barium metaborate pigment, a borate-based 
pigment, is also known as a low-pollution anti-corrosive 
pigment which contains neither chromium nor lead. However, barium metaborate is specified to be a non-medical 
deleterious substance by the Japanese Poisonous and 
Deleterious Substances Control Law and other applicable laws. 
Therefore, special attention should be given to the health and 
safety of a person who handles barium metaborate and, care 
should be taken not to allow people to directly touch a 
portion on which a paint containing the barium metaborate 
pigment is applied. Thus, the use of barium metaborate is 
limited by such situations. Further, conventional anti-corrosive pigments
