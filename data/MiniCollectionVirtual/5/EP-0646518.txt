<ABSTRACT>
The invention proceeds from a track for tracked vehicles, especially snow vehicles, having transversely extending carriers (2) which are anchored by means of screws passing through their U-shaped base. In order to prevent the shanks (9) of the screws from breaking or prematurely wearing, that end of the screw shanks (9) which faces the carriers (2) is designed, due to the invention, as an abutment for a rubber pad which is supported against the web (5) of the carrier bases which, for their part, bear against the tracks (1). This measure results in the provision of an elastic connection.

Tread strip for caterpillar-tracked vehicles, more 
especially for snow vehicles, having one or more 

substantially inextensible bands (1), which extend parallel 
to one another and on which transversely extending 

entrainment means are mounted by means of bolts (9), which 
extend through the bands and the base (5, 6) of the 

entrainment means which has a U-shaped cross-section, or by 
means of screws or rivets, the two portions (6) of the base 

extending substantially perpendicular to the bands, and the 
web (5), which connects the portions, extending parallel to 

the strip plane and being abuttable against the strip body, 
characterised in that the end of the bolts (9) facing the 

entrainment means (7) is provided with an abutment (16) for 
a cushioning pad (14), which is formed from rubber or 

rubber-like substances (elastomers) and is supported on the 
web (5) of the base. 
Strip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the bolt (9) is situated in the bore (8) in the web (5) 

with some clearance. 
Strip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the width of the cushioning pad (14) and of the abutment 

(16) corresponds at least substantially to the mutual 
spacing between the two portions (6). 
Strip according to claims 1 and 3, characterised in 
that the cushioning pad (14) and the abutment (16) fill at 

least substantially the U-shaped base (5, 6) of the 
entrainment means (2). 
Strip according to claims 1 and 3, characterised in 
that, in its non-deformed state, the cushioning pad (14) 

has one or more recesses (17) or cavities, which are wholly  
 

or partially eliminated or reduced in the event of a 
pressure deformation by the bolt (9). 
Strip according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the diameter of the bore (8) in the web (5) is 

substantially 5 - 15 % greater than the diameter (D) of the 
bolt (9). 
Strip according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the cushioning pad (14) is provided on its lateral faces 

with longitudinally extending grooves (17). 
Strip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the cushioning pad (14) and the abutment (16) extend 

substantially over the width of the bands (1). 
Strip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the bolt is a screw bolt (9), and the cushioning pad (14) 

is initially tensioned by screws. 
Strip according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the rubber or the like of the cushioning pad (14) is freely 

deformable at the end faces of the cushioning pad (14) 
situated in the region of the strip edges. 
Strip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the abutment (16) has one or more bores (15) for the 

accommodation of the bolts (9). 
Strip according to claim 11, characterised in that 
the bores (15) are threaded holes. 
Strip according to claims 1 and 9, characterised in 
that the transition (x) between the smooth shank of the 

bolt (9) and the portion of the bolt shank provided with 
thread (9') is disposed in the region of the cushioning pad 

(14).  
 
Strip according to claim 13, characterised in that 
the transition (x) is situated substantially halfway up the 

cushioning pad (14).
