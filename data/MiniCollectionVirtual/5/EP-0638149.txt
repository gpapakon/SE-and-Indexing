<ABSTRACT>
A friction material facing and carrier assembly (10) for a clutch driven plate in which at least one annular friction facing (20A) is secured to the carrier (11) by stripes (24A, 24B, 24C, 24D) of adhesive elastomeric material which are coaxial with the facing. The carrier plate includes circular rows (15, 16, 17) of perforations (14) and the stripes of adhesive are located on the circular lands (25, 26, 27, 28) either side of and between adjacent rows of perforations. The stripes of adhesive may be joined together to provide a continuous stripe of adhesive which extends from the radially inner margin of the facing to the radially outer margin of the facing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction material facing and 
carrier assemblies particularly for friction clutch driven 
plates, and to a method of manufacture thereof. It is known to manufacture a friction clutch driven plate by 
the use of adhesive to secure an annular friction facing to a 
support or carrier plate. In conventional driven plates an 
epoxy resin based adhesive may be used for this purpose. It is desirable for the friction facing of a driven plate to 
have a certain degree of flexibility and axial cushioning. 
The epoxy resin adhesive film generally provides little or no 
compliance or cushioning. The axial cushioning is desired to ameliorate a phenomenon 
known in the trade as "heat spotting", which leads to 
localised overheating of high spots on the friction faces of 
the driven plate, flywheel, or pressure plate. The cushioning 
also helps to prevent clutch judder on take-up of the drive. The necessary axial cushioning is generally provided between 
the opposed back faces of a pair of annular friction tracings. 
This is conventionally achieved by mounting the tracings on 
spring steel cushioning segments.  
 EP0252583A, describes the use of a silicone rubber adhesive 
for mounting a friction facing onto a carrier or support. The silicone rubber adhesive serves to secure the facing to 
its support and also provides the necessary axial cushioning, 
thus allowing a simplification of the driven plate 
construction. In WO89/05411 there is disclosed a construction 
in which the silicone rubber adhesive is formed in discrete 
concentrically spaced circles. Each circle of adhesive is 
described as being formed by a respective adhesive nozzle. In WO91/10842 there is described a friction material facing 
and carrier assembly for a clutch driven plate, and which 
comprises at least one annular friction facing secured to the 
carrier by a plurality of concentric circular stripes of 
adhesive elastomeric material which are coaxial with the 
facing, each circular stripe being interrupted at only a 
single point on the circle to form a gap between the 
beginning and end of the respective circle, and the 
interruptions in each circular stripe are radially aligned 
one with the other, and the end of one circular stripe is 
joined to the beginning of the adjacent concentric circular 
stripe so that the adhesive forms a continuous stripe from 
the radially inner margin of the facing to the radially outer 
margin of the facing.  
 The carrier plates described in the above documents each 
comprise an annular
