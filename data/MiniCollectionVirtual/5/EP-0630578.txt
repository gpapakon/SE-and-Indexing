<ABSTRACT>
A method of pigmenting the egg yolk, integuments and/or 
subcutaneous fat of poultry and the meat and/or integuments of fish and 

crustacea involves including in the feed of the poultry, fish or crustacea one 
or more of the carotenoids 2'-dehydroplectaniaxanthin, 1-hydroxy-3,4-didehydro-1,2-dihydro-Ψ,Ψ-caroten-2-one, 

desmethylspheroidenone, 
spheroidenone, 5'-hydroxy-5',6'-dihydro-4'-apo-β-caroten-6'-one, 1'-hydroxy-3',4'-didehydro-1',2'-dihydro-β,Ψ-carotene-4,2'-dione 

and 5'-hydroxy-5',6'-dihydro-4'-apo-β-carotene-4,6'-dione. 
Also embraced by the invention are the 

pertinent carotenoid-enriched feed for poultry, fish or crustacea, the 
premixes for incorporation in such feeds and beadlets containing one or 

more of these carotenoids for incorporation in such premixes, the use of the 
carotenoids in the pigmenting method and the four new carotenoids of the 

seven aforementioned carotenoids. The new carotenoids can be produced by 
condensing in each case an appropriate aldehyde with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone, 

thereby forming the characteristic terminal 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propionyl 
group.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is well known that carotenoids are natural pigments which occur
abundantly in the plant and animal kingdoms and which in some cases
have also been produced by synthetic means. Further synthetically produced
carotenoids do not appear to occur in nature. Many important carotenoids
are employed as pigments in the food and feedstuff industries, e.g. for
colouring egg yolk, poultry, fish and crustacea, notably in the cases of ethyl
β-apo-8'-carotenoate, citranaxanthin, canthaxanthin and astaxanthin. For
this purpose the carotenoid pigments are added to the animals' rations as a
method of imparting an enhanced and aesthetically more acceptable visual
impression of colour, be it in the animal integuments, such as the skin,
shanks and beaks of poultry and the skin, scales and shells of fish and
crustacea, as appropriate, subcutaneous fat of poultry and the meat of fish
and crustacea, or in such animal products as eggs (yolk). The enhancement
of pigmentation depends on the particular light-absorbing conjugated double
bond system of the carotenoid concerned, the degree of ease with which the
carotenoid is taken up into the animal body following consumption of the
carotenoid-enriched feed (deposition rate) and the concentration of the
carotenoid or any metabolites in the target animal body tissue or product,
amongst many other factors. However, from a knowledge of the structure of
the selected carotenoid it cannot be predicted how effectively it functions as a
pigment in this area of application. A further factor involved is the stability
of the carotenoid, e.g. towards atmospheric oxidation, light, temperature
and dampness, in an animal feedstuff when stored under the normal
conditions to which such a feedstuff is subjected.With respect to poultry an acceptable level and quality of pigmentation
is desired for the integuments of the birds destined for consumption and for
egg yolk. The use of materials to enhance yolk colour, for example, is
generally promoted because consumers prefer deeply (particularly rich
golden yellow) pigmented yolks. The visual appearance is indeed an
important factor in the assessment of quality. Broilers and ornamental
birds, for example, are in many parts of the world more aesthetically
acceptable if their integuments, particularly skin, shanks and beaks, and in
the case of broilers, also subcutaneous fat satisfy certain criteria of
pigmentation. The need for supplementary pigmentation is especially 
prevalent today in view of the reduction of grass consumption with the
modern methods
