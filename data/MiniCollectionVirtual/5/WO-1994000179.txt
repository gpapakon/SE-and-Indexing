<ABSTRACT>
A stent comprising a coil including a plurality of arcuate sections (40, 42, 50, 52) that alternate directions around a central axis (38) each arcuate section including a pair of curved turns joined by a cusp (48, 58) and the cusps of adjacent arcuate sections intermeshing and defining at least one region of overlap, which in turn describes a helix around and along the length of the coil. In the preferred embodiment, there are two regions of overlap, which together describe a double helix. In another preferred embodiment, the stent is bifurcated so as to support a branched vessel or the like. A method for forming a stent, including the steps of providing a flat sheet of material, chemically etching said sheet to form a blank, and forming said blank into a cylindrical coil, is also disclosed. The coiling step is preferably carried out on a plurality of rollers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING A STENTThe present invention is a continuation-in-part of a copending application entitled "Artificial Support for a Blood Vessel," filed June 18, 1992 and having Serial Number 07/900.896.TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to supports for collapsed or occluded blood vessels, and more particularly, to a coiled wire stent for insertion and expansion in a collapsed or occluded blood vessel. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a coiled, bifurcated stent which supports a Y-shaped juncture of two blood vessels.The present invention further relates to methods and apparatus for manufacturing artificial supports for blood vessels and more particularly, to methods for making a wire coil having certain desired properties. Still more particularly, the present invention discloses methods and apparatus for preparing a continuous loop and forming the loop into a cylindrical shape having a desired configuration.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A typical wire stent for insertion and expansion in a collapsed or occluded blood vessel is shown in U.S. Patent 4,800,882 and includes a coiled wire having a plurality of curved sections that are formed into a generally circular configuration. Adjacent curved sections are joined by a bend so that a series of alternating opposing loops are formed. The stent has a cylindrical shape with a longitudinal opening through which a folded balloon catheter is inserted. The opposing loops are tightly contracted about the catheter so that the cylindrical shape has an overlapping region in which portions of adjacent loops circumferentially overlap. The loops are arranged so that when the balloon catheter is intlated, adjacent lυυps diverge circumferentially relative to each other, thereby decreasing the width of the overlapping region while increasing the diameter of the cylindrical shape. As the diameter of the cylindrical stent increases, the stent engages the inner surface of the blood vessel .In operation, the stent is deployed at its desired position within the vessel in its collapsed state, by threading the balloon catheter up the vessel from an incision some distance away, and then expanded to its expanded state, for supportive engagement with the interior of the vessel wall .The prior art ste s have several deficiencies. As shown in Figure 7 of U.S. Patent 4,800,882, the alternating bends are aligned in relation to the longitudinal axis o the stent such that upon expansion of the stent as shown in Figure 8.

Claims What is claimed is:
1. A stent for supporting a blood vessel, comprising: a single length of material comprising a continuous loop; said material being bent to form a coil about a longitudinal axis, said defining a helix around said longitudinal axis; and
2. A stent for supporting a blood vessel, comprising: a length of material bent into a plurality of clockwise and counterclockwise arcuate sections each having an adjacent cusp at which the material reverses directions; said arcuate sections forming a coil with a longitudinal axis about which said arcuate sections are circumferentially disposed; said cusps of said clockwise and counterclockwise arcuate sections overlapping to form at least one region of overlap; and said region of overlap extending helically about the longitudinal axis. 3. A method for forming the stent of claim 1 , comprising the steps of: providing a sheet of material from which the stent is to be formed; photoetching said sheet so as to form a continuous loop; rolling said continuous loop obliquely between a series of rollers so as to form said continuous loop into a cylindrical stent; and removing said cylindrical stent from said rollers.
4. A double-helix stent. comprising: a single length of material having first and second ends and forming first and second halves, each half comprising a series of arcuate sections, each section comprising a pair of curved turns, adjacent turns being joined by cusps, said material reversing direction at each cusp and never crossing over itself, said halves being constructed so that the cusps of said first half intermesh with the cusps of said second half, thereby forming two diametrically opposed regions of overlap, each region of overlap being shifted incrementally circumferentially with each turn so that the two regions of overlap describe a double helix around the stent. 5. The stent according to claim 4 wherein said first and second ends of said material are joined so as to form a continuous loop. 6. A single-helix stent, comprising: a length of material having first and second ends, said material forming a plurality of arcuate sections without crossing
'
 over itself, each section comprising a pair of curved turns, adjacent turns being joined by a cusp, adjacent sections curving in opposite directions 


 and adjacent cusps overlapping circumferentially to form a single region of overlap, said region of overlap being shifted incrementally circumferentially with each successive turn, so that the region of overlap describes a spiral around the stent. said first and second ends being at opposite ends of said coil. 7. A bifurcated stent for supporting a bifurcated vessel without obstructing fluid flow therethrough, comprising: a major coil consisting essentially of the stent of claim 1 : and two minor coils affixed to and integral with one end of the major coil.
8. The stent according to claim 7 wherein said major coil and said minor coils are all formed from a single continuous loop.
9. A stent for supporting a blood vessel, comprising: a continuous loop of material wound into a cylindrical double spiral.
10. The stent according to claim 9 wherein said continuous loop includes a pair of ends and a pair of legs extending between said ends, said legs being serpentine.
