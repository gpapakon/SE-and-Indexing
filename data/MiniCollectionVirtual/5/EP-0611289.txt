<ABSTRACT>
A system (100) for distinguishing among a plurality of materials is disclosed. The system comprises a laser (101) for producing substantially monochromatic electromagnetic energy (103), which impacts a substance (105). The substance (105) generates a pressure wave (107) characteristic of the identity of the substance in response to the impact. An analyzer (109) is operatively oriented to receive the pressure wave (107) and identifies the substance in response to the pressure wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PATHOLOGICALÎ—SSUEANALYSISANDREMOVALSYSTEMField of the Invention The invention relates generally to a system and method utilizing a laser for substance analysis and, in particular, to a system and method utilizing a laser for analyzing and removing blockage in a blood vessel.Background of the Invention One of the most frequent causes of death is cardiovascular diseases and the single biggest cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty and fibrous deposits, that may or may not contain calcium, in an artery. Eventually the buildup may entirely block the artery. Moreover, if the artery is a coronary artery, the buildup may cause a heart attack. Treatment of atherosclerosis requires that either a new path for blood flow be provided, or that the blockage be removed. There are two widely used methods for treating coronary atherosclerosis. First, bypass surgery may be used to reroute blood around a section of blocked heart artery. Second, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) , widens an existing path of blood flow. PTCA, also called balloon angioplasty, involves passing a catheter through the skin into a blood vessel and threading the catheter through the cardiovascular 

 system to the partially blocked artery. A balloon is attached to the catheter and when the balloon is positioned in the partially blocked vessel, the balloon is inflated and compresses the atherosclerotic plaque, opening the artery. Thus, the vessel's interior diameter is widened to permit sufficient blood flow. Similar techniques are used for other arteries in the body.Coronary bypass surgery has some limitations. It is difficult, expensive and, in some circumstances, has a relatively high mortality rate. It is the only procedure useful for clearing occluded arteries.A third method of clearing plaque is to use a tiny auger type device. Such a device is threaded to the blockage in a manner similar to that used in PCTA, but clears the blockage mechanically by grinding it away.The use of balloon angioplasty (PTCA) and the auger method also have their limitations. The bends in arteries and the irregular configurations of plaque deposits make it difficult to reach every diseased area. Balloon angioplasty may knock pieces of plaque loose, which then flow through the vascular system. As an artery narrows, the plaque will eventually block the vessel, causing an obstruction. Moreover, in vessels that are totally obstructed it is not possible to penetrate the deposits in order to use
