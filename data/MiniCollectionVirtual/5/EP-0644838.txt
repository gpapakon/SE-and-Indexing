A hovercraft with two engines (2,3) arranged laterally at 
the stern to generate forward motion, a compressor to 

generate an air-cushion beneath the craft and a stabiliser 
arrangement with an associated trimmer located in the air 

jet of the engines (2,3) whereby an additional force component 
is generated by an additional deflection of the air 

jets of both engines (2,3) characterised in that the stabiliser 
arrangement comprises a negatively arranged V-plane 

(7), whose downwardly directed stabiliser surfaces 
(9,10), which are each fitted with a rudder element 

(11,12), run centrally through the flow outlet apertures 
of the engines (2,3) and that the above mentioned additional 

force component is generated by additional deflection 
of the air jets of both engines (2,3), which is constantly 

superimposed on the directional control. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claim 1, characterised in that 
the additional deflection is executed in such a way that 

the craft is trimmed about the longitudinal axis of stability.  
 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claim 1, characterised in that 
the additional deflection is executed in such a way that 

the craft is trimmed about the transverse axis of stability. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claim 1, characterised in that 
the additional deflection is executed in such a way
 that 
the craft is trimmed simultaneously about the transverse 

and longitudinal axes of stability. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that one air jet or the air jets of both engines (2;3) are 

deflected while the hovercraft is stationary or moving 
slowly until the craft reaches a horizontal position. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the air jets of one or both engines (2;3) are deflected 

by adjusting one or both of the rudder elements 
(11,12) of the V-plane (7) and superimposing this deflection 

on the directional control. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claim 6, characterised in that 
the hovercraft is trimmed about the transverse axis of 

stability by setting the rudder elements (11,12) of the V-plane 
(7) in the same direction. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claim 6, characterised in that 
the hovercraft is trimmed about the longitudinal axis of 

stability by setting the rudder elements (11,12) of the V-plane 
(7) in opposite directions. 
Hovercraft trimmer as per Claim 6, characterised in that 
the hovercraft is trimmed by simultaneously setting the 

rudder elements (11,12) of the V-plane (7).
