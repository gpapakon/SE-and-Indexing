<ABSTRACT>
On an electronic map for a vehicle navigation system, street names are 
displayed alongside the streets, a finite number of different fonts being 

used for the characters of the names, depending on the slope of the streets 

or street segments. Names may follow curved streets. In case of names 
colliding, names may be left out, shifted or abbreviated in order to avoid 

the map being cluttered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display system for displaying a steady net of
distinct and interconnected geographical paths and containing storage means for storing
said net as an arrangement of vectors each associated to a particular said path, select
means for signalling an intended selection from said net, reading cum routing means
controlled by said select means for reading said storage means and outputting said
selection, and display means for displaying said selection. Geographical paths include
various kinds of roads on land or water. The visual representation thereof has proven
advantageous for purposes of route planning and navigation, such as by motor car, for
designing public facility arteries, for educational purposes, and others. The storage of a
net in the form of vectors is very storage effective, inasmuch as each vector may be
sufficiently well represented by means of an identifier, origin, length, orientation,
identifiers of connecting vectors, and a few additional qualifiers that may indicate
capacity, character, and a few additional attributes. This listing however, is neither
exhaustive nor limitative. Storage of a road network of this kind has been described in
EP 181.012 corresponding US Patent Application Serial 07/772,062 (PHN 11.122) to
the assignee of the present application. Designers of such systems have found that the
generally non-expert user person needs additional clues as to what action should be
taken next, and even information regarding generally relevant geographical items, such
as geographical names, without however, necessitating complex hardware or software,
which for the general public would not be considered cost-effective. In particular in an
environment where the orientation of the map with respect to the display device may be
variable, the display of names may need attention. WO 86/02764 discloses a display system in which labels are displayed beside their associated paths, such that re-orientation of the display leads to re-orientation of the alphanumeric characters in the labels.Accordingly, amongst other things, it is an object of the present invention
to provide a display system of the kind described that offers improved ease of
recognition of the geographical information through the provision of geographical 
names, together with allowing various processing additives for realizing an improved
human interface, without requiring high investments in processing and/or storage
facilities.The invention is defined in the appended Claims 1-10. The invention also

<CLAIMS>
A display system for displaying a steady net of distinct and interconnected
geographical paths and containing storage means for storing said net as an arrangement

of vectors each associated to a particular said path and for storing an associated
geographical name for at least some of the vectors, select means for signalling an

intended selection from said net, reading cum routing means controlled by said select
means for reading said storage means and outputting said selection, and display means

for displaying said selection, characterized in

that said display means comprise font means with at least two different basic fonts, each
with a respective basic orientation, for generating a display font for a character for said

name of a particular displayed path when passed along said reading cum routing means,
and
that said display means are arranged for selecting one of the basic fonts in dependence
on the orientation of the particular displayed path.
A display system as claimed in Claim 1, wherein a first one of the basic
fonts corresponds to an upright position and wherein a second one of the basic fonts

corresponds to a direction that is rotated 45° with respect to the first basic font.
A display system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein said routing means
transmit a fraction of the street names contained in said selection while blocking further

names as an anti-clutter measure.
A display system as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said display
means accommodate shifting of a name along its associated path for containability

within a display window or for symmetrizing reasons.
A display system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, wherein said routing
means are arranged for selective abbreviating of a said name.
A display system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, wherein said font
means are arranged for generating display fonts with a character orientation rotated at

most +/-90° with respect an upright position.
A display system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6, wherein said display 
means are arranged for displaying a single name associated to a non-straight path as a

string of characters that has variations in either character orientation or row orientation
between respective characters.
A display system as claimed in Claim 7, wherein said path is divided into
a sequence of straight segments, and the orientation of successive characters of said

string is modelled according to a local segment direction, while adhering to a hysteresis
for an orientation change between successive characters in said string.
A display system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 8, and having frame
storage means for after said selection storing an actual frame on a pixel-by-pixel basis

for subsequent display.
A road vehicle having an on-board road-based navigation system
comprising a display system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 9 for displaying a road

map as retrieved from a mass storage means.
