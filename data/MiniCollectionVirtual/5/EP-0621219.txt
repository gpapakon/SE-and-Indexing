<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor (10) of the kind specified wherein the spindles for at 
least some of 

the rollers (14) comprise stub spindles (20) mounted on the side members 
(11), there being a 

pair of opposed stub spindles (20) for each such roller (14) and each 
stub spindle (20) having 

an end portion (22) which extends within a socket (19) provided at an 
end of the roller, 

each end (22) portion being barrel shaped, as hereindefined, and the 
stub spindle (20) and 

socket (19) being adapted to inter-engage to prevent relative rotation

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a conveyor frame, hereinafter referred to as being 
of the kind specified, comprising a pair of spaced side members each having a 
plurality of mounting means to mount a plurality of rollers in spaced relation 
between the side members. The invention also relates to a conveyor, hereinafter 
referred to as being of the kind specified, comprising a conveyor frame of the 
kind specified having a plurality of rollers mounted between said side members, 
each roller being provided with a hearing means having a socket the rollers being 
mounted in spaced relation between said pair of side members on spindles which 
are carried by said mounting means and which are provided with a portion which 
extends within the socket, to permit each roller to rotate about a roller axis. In a conveyor of the type specified, the rollers may be free running or 
driven. Articles may be placed directly on the conveyor rollers or on an endless 
conveyor belt which extends around the rollers to provide a greater support area 
for articles in a known manner. Such conveyors may extend horizontally or may 
be inclined. The spindle may comprise a polygonal in cross-section elongate element 
which is received in said socket and which extends throughout it a roller and has 
end portions which project outwardly from opposite ends of the roller and are 
mounted on said side members so as to span therebetween. The polygonal shape 
prevents relative rotation between the socket and the spindle and between the 
spindle and the frame members. Alternatively, the spindle may comprise stub spindles mounted on the side 
members, there being a pair of opposed stub spindles for each roller and each 
stub spindle having an end portion which extends within a socket provided at each 
end of the roller. An object of the invention is to provide a new and improved conveyor of 
the kind specified. According to one aspect of the present invention we provide a conveyor 
of the kind specified wherein the spindles for at least some of the rollers comprise 
stub spindles mounted on the side members, there being a pair of opposed stub  
 
spindles for each such roller and each stub spindle having an end portion which 
extends within a socket provided at an end of the roller, each end portion being 
barrel shaped and the stub spindle and socket being adapted to inter-engage to 
prevent relative rotation therebetween and the stub spindle comprising a one-piece 
moulding of synthetic plastics material. According to another aspect of the

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor of the kind specified wherein the spindles for at least some of 
the rollers comprise stub spindles mounted on the side members, there being a 

pair of opposed stub spindles for each such roller and each stub spindle having 
an end portion which extends within a socket provided at an end of the roller, 

each end portion being barrel shaped, as herein defined, and the stub spindle and 
socket being adapted to inter-engage to prevent relative rotation therebetween 

and the stub spindle comprising a one-piece moulding of synthetic plastics 
material. 
A conveyor frame of the kind specified and: 

(a) a first plurality of rollers each having a bearing means providing a 
socket at ea
ch end, a pair of stub spindles for each roller of said 
first plurality, each stub spindle having an end portion, which is 

barrel shaped, as herein defined, and is adapted to extend within an 
associated socket to inter-engage therewith to prevent relative 

rotation therebetween, and a support portion adapted to inter-engage 
with a mounting means of an associated frame member to 

inter-engage therewith to prevent relative rotation therebetween, 
and each stub spindle comprising a one-piece moulding of synthetic 

plastics material; 
(b) a second plurality of rollers each having a bearing means providing 
a socket, an elongate spindle element for each roller of said second 

plurality, each spindle element having a portion which is adapted 
to extend within an associated socket to inter-engage therewith to 

prevent relative rotation therebetween and, at opposite ends, 
support portions adapted to inter-engage with the same mounting 

means as are inter-engageable with said support portions of the 
stub spindles, to inter-engage with said mounting means to prevent 

relative rotation therebetween. 
A method of making a conveyor of the kind specified comprising the steps 
of taking a conveyor frame of the kind specified, and selecting either: 


(a) a first plurality of rollers each having a bearing means providing a 
socket at each end, a pair of stub spindles for each roller of said 

first plurality, each stub spindle having an end portion, which is 
barrel shaped, as hereindefined, and is adapted to extend within an 

associated socket to inter-engage therewith to prevent relative 
rotation therebetween, and a support portion adapted to inter-engage 

with a mounting means of an associated frame member to 
inter-engage therewith to prevent relative rotation therebetween, 

and each stub spindle comprising a one-piece moulding of synthetic 
plastics material, or 
(b) a second plurality of rollers, each having a bearing means providing 
a socket, an elongate spindle element for each roller of said second 

plurality, each spindle element having a portion which is adapted 
to extend within an associated socket to inter-engage therewith to 

prevent relative rotation therebetween and, at opposite ends, 
support portions adapted to inter-engage with the same mounting 

means as are inter-engageable with said support portions of the 
stub spindles to inter-engage with said mounting means to prevent 

relative rotation therebetween and engaging the support portions 
of the selected plurality of rollers with said mounting means to 

mount the rollers of the selected plurality in spaced relation 
between said pair of side members. 
The invention as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein each 
end portion is polygonal in cross-sections taken normal to an elongate axis thereof 

and comprises intersecting surfaces which are convexly curved in radial planes 
containing said axis. 
The invention as claimed in Claim 4 wherein said surfaces are rectilinear 
in radial planes normal to said axis. 
The invention as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim 5 wherein each end part is 
hexagonal in cross-section. 
The invention as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein each 
socket is of prism shape and has a cross-section which corresponds to the 

maximum cross-section of the end part. 
The invention as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
end portion is bounded by edges which lie in planes normal to the axis. 
The invention as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein each 
support portion is receivable in an open-topped socket formed in an associated 

one of the side members, said open-topped socket having a part of the same 
cross-sectional shape as part of said socket of the roller and the respective shapes 

of the support portion and the open-topped socket being such that the support 
portion is constrained against rotation relative to the side member and the end 

portion is constrained with the support portion. 
The invention as claimed in Claim 9 wherein each support portion 
comprises a shank portion connected to the end portion, the shank being of a 

configuration which co-operates with the open-topped socket to effect said 
constraint of rotation and having two spaced apart flanges and the shank being 

received in the open-topped socket with the flanges either side of the side 
member. 
The invention as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
synthetic material is provided with a capability for electrical conductivity.
