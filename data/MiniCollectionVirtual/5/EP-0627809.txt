<ABSTRACT>
An inverter is operated to eliminate hiss in the 
control of the speed of an induction motor using an inverter of 

variable frequency. The voltage is matched to the selected 
frequency to avoid such hiss and control of the voltage is 

effected by regulating spacing between the pulses outputted by 
the pilot unit to the gates of the MOSFETs or IGBTs forming the 

arms of the inverter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of operating 
an inverter for powering an electric induction motor and, more 
particularly, to a method of driving an induction motor utilizing 
an electric inverter and frequency control for regulating the 
motor speed without the hiss usually associated with frequency 
control of an induction motor. With increasing automation of various processes, speed 
control of electrical induction motors has become of increasing 
interest. Asynchronous induction motors can vary in speed only 
upon variation of the frequency of the electronic power supplied 
to the motor. The electronic power is derived from the network 
at a fixed network frequency (usually 50 or 60 Hz) and is 
converted to a variable frequency alternating current in a so-called 
"inverter". The inverter generally converts the network 
alternating current into a direct current and, in turn, the 
direct current into an alternating current whose frequency can be 
controlled by controlling the conductivity timing of the power 
transistors of the inverter. For an induction motor to be operated correctly, it is 
known that saturation of the magnetic core should be avoided 
under all supply conditions, but that the motor should be 
energized with the maximum magnetic flux short of saturation for 
optimum mechanical efficiency. The voltage supplied to the motor cannot be maintained 
constant while the frequency is varied, but rather must increase  
 
approximately linearly with a linear increase in frequency and 
hence in speed. This relationship is due to the fact that 
electromotive counterforce (back EMF) generated by the motor 
which counteracts the applied supply voltage must, by reason of 
LENZ's Law,, increase with the increased frequency. The magnetic 
flux in the magnetic circuit should be maintained constant. The 
magnetic flux is proportional to the applied voltage and 
inversely proportional to the frequency thereof. By varying the 
frequency, the speed of the rotating field can be generated and 
the mechanical speed of the motor fixed therewith. An inverter capable of delivering the alternating 
supply voltage with variable frequency to an induction motor, 
comprises generally the aforementioned rectifier stage which can 
include a condenser or capacitor functioning as a filter for 
converting the alternating voltage of the supply network to 
direct current, power transistors which can be of the MOSFET 
(Metal oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) or IGBT 
(Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor)
