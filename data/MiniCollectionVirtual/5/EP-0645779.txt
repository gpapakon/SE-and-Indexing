<ABSTRACT>
An insulator includes a housing portion. 
The housing portion is composed a silicone rubber 

obtained by curing a composition containing 
diorganopolysiloxane (A) and a fine silicon powder (B) 

by heating, and a methylalkylpolysiloxane oil (C). 

The diorganopolysiloxane has at least two silicon atom-bonded 
alkenyl groups in one molecule. The methylalkylpolysiloxane 

oil (C) has each of both terminal ends of 
each molecular chain blocked with a trialkylsiloxy group 

and possessing a viscosity at 25°C being 1 to 1,000 
centistokes, and is incorporated into the above 

composition in an amount of 1-100 parts by weight per 
100 parts by weight of the component (A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to insulators 
adapted to be used for supporting transmission lines or 
the like and particularly having excellent water-repellency 
recoverability. So-called polymer insulators are each 
constituted by covering the outer periphery of a core 
member made of an FRP with shed portions made of 
silicone rubber. It has come to be known that such 
polymer insulators exhibit large effects such as 
prevention of corona noise and flash-over in polluted 
environments due to excellent water repellency of 
silicone rubber. In general, shaped bodies made of polymer 
materials exhibit water repellency at an initial use 
stage. However, there is a drawback that when such 
shaped bodies are used outside, they lose their water 
repellency in a relatively short time due to irradiation 
with solar beams (ultraviolet rays). On the other hand, 
it is known that fluorine resins represented by Teflon,  
 
silicone rubber and silicone resin are strong against 
ultraviolet rays. However, when even fluorine resin or silicone 
resin are used as a covering material for high voltage 
insulators, their water repellency is unfavorably lost 
with the lapse of time through being exposed to partial 
discharging at the surface thereof, and pollutants 
attached onto the surfaces. Some researchers reported, 
however, that although silicone rubber among the above 
materials tentatively loses water repellency when the 
surface is exposed to partial discharging or attached 
with pollutant, such silicone rubber recovers its water 
repellency after that (for example, after 24 hours). 
This is a fact that the inventors also confirmed. Although the mechanism by which this water-repellency 
is recovered has not been clarified, certain 
researchers explain that this mechanism is based on the 
phenomenon that a low molecular silicone component 
contained in silicone rubber gradually oozes out with 
the lapse of time. The present inventors have confirmed 
this through various experiments, and support the above 
explanation. Such a kind of the low molecular silicone component 
is not a component positively added into silicone 
rubber, but exists in only an extremely small amount as 
a byproduct produced in the production step of  
 
diorganopolysiloxane, which is used as a main starting 
material for silicone rubber. For this reason, there is 
a problem that the low molecular silicone component is 
being exhausted as the use time period increases, so 
that the time required to recover water repellency 
increases, and the
