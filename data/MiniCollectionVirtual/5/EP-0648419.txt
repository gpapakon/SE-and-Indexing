<ABSTRACT>
Convection oven comprising a body (shell) with a polygonal base, preferably rectangular, which internally configures a cavity constituting the cooking chamber, provided with a turntable and open on two of its opposite faces, defined by two opposite walls, one of which incorporates an inlet orifice for the air circulating towards the heating means where it is heated then thrown onto the impellor means towards a bridging pipe arranged on the roof of the cooking chamber and which communicates with a cavity situated behind the opposite partition of the cooking chamber which in its middle has a series of adjustable-width vertical slots through which the hot air emerges, driven into the cooking chamber.

A preferably rectangular air convection oven consisting
of a housing with a polygonal base internally forming a

cavity which is the cooking chamber (2), provided with a
rotating plate equipped with means of heating and impelling

hot air which circulates in its interior. Said cooking
chamber (2) is open in two of its opposite faces (3),

defined by two opposite walls (4)-(5), having a central area
with a trapezoidal base projecting towards the outside of

the oven and limited by some chamfers (6,7) converging
towards the center of the pertinent wall, forming a cavity

(2) without corners. One of the mentioned walls (4), has
some holes (9) for the intake of air towards the heating

means (10) in which it is heated and projected through the
impelling means towards a conduction bridge (12) on the

chamber (2) ceiling and communicating with a cavity (13)
located behind the wall (5), opposite the rear wall (4)

having a series of vertical grooves (14) in its center of
adjustable width, through which the hot air flows, such that

the hot air is projected behind the wall (4), led across the
bridge (12) to the cavity (13) in front of some heating

means (10) and obliged to cross the cooking chamber (2),
from end to end, from wall (5) to wall (4), being uniformly

distributed in said chamber and preventing the formation of
accumulation areas of cold air in its interior.
An oven, according to the previous claim, characterized
in that the cavity (13) behind the wall furthest from the

heating means (10), likewise has some vertical outlets (15)
of adjustable width, near to the accesses (3) to the cooking

chamber (2), slightly converging towards the interior of the
latter, through which some peripheral hot air currents

emerge. 
An oven, according to the previous claims,
characterized in that the accesses (3) to the cooking

chamber (2), on the side nearest to the heating means, has
some vertical outlets (16), of adjustable width, through

which hot air emerges, coming from the respective branches
(17) of the upper conduction bridge (12), defining at its

exit some hot air currents limiting the main current
circulating in an opposite direction, by guiding it together

with the aspiration created by the impelling means, towards
the inlet hole (9) of the heating means.
An oven, according to the previous claims,
characterized in that all the hot air outlets (14)-(15)-(16),

distributed vertically, are defined by a fixed flank
(18) provided with an overhanging fin (19) and an unmovable

flank provided with a fin parallel to the previous one, to
independently permit the width adjustment of each outlet.
An oven, according to the previous claims,
characterized in that the hot air impulsion means consist of

a single turbine located on top of the heating means (10),
sucking the hot air and projecting it across the conduction

bridge (12).
An oven, according to the previous claims,
characterized in that the middle area of the wall (7)

closest to the heating means (10) has in its upper area, a
humidification chamber (8) attached to the heating means,

with a hole (9) in the lower area, for the entrance of air
towards the heating means.
An oven, according to the previous claims,
characterized in that it includes externally, an electric

control panel (24), automatically triggering the hot air
impulsion turbine (11) to stop for a pre-determined time,

once vaporization of the cooking chamber has been completed
by means of the humidification chamber (8), preventing the 

emission of vapor outside.
An oven, according to the previous claims,
characterized in that the accesses (3) to the cooking

chamber (2), have an external frame (21), open by opposite
vertical grooves (22), related to respective room

temperature air impulsion means, which on leaving these
grooves, form respective curtains of air, slightly

converging towards the inside (2) of the oven and impinging
over some transparent protection plates (23), located in

each entrance (3) of the cooking chamber, between the
interior peripheral hot air exits (15)-(16) and the external

room temperature outlets (21).
An oven, according to claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the accesses (3) to the cooking chamber (2) are

delimited by external protection plates (23), over which,
directed from the interior, some curtains of air at room

temperature, emerging through the vertical accesses defined
around each one of the accesses to the chamber.
An oven, according to claims 8 and 9, characterized in
that the room temperature air exits (21), define some

amplitude adjustment means, similar to those of the hot air
exits.
