<ABSTRACT>
The axial end portions of the insulating 
members (30) which are used to line the longitudinal 

channels formed between circumferentially adjacent, 
radially inwardly projecting poles in a stator 

(e.g., an electric motor stator) are protected from 
damage by the wire being wound by providing terminal 

boards (20) at each axial end of the stator having portions 
which overhang the axial ends of the insulating 

members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for
making stators for electric motors and similar machines
such as generators. Although the invention is described
herein in the context of its application to electric motor
stators, it will be understood that it is equally applicable
to other types of stators such as have been mentioned.Terminal boards for electric motor stators are insulating
members which are typically placed on both axial
ends of the main stator body for such purposes as supporting
the axial ends of the windings wound on the
poles of the stator and providing insulated attachment
points forthe terminals at which the ends of the coil wires
can be connected to wires external to the stator.Recently there has been increasing interest in winding
stators without winding forms (see, for example,
Wheeler U.S. patent 4,612,702 and WO-A-8 901 257. This can simplify the
winding apparatus and speed the winding process, but
it can also increase the strain and wear on the insulating
inserts which are typically placed in the stator between
circumferentially adjacent poles in order to prevent short
circuits between the coils and the stator. Such strain and
wearcan compromise the insulating effectiveness of the
insulating member, possibly resulting in short circuits to
the stator. Dislocation or distortion of the insulating
member may also occur, possibly resulting in vibration
or interference with free rotation of the armature in the
finished motor.In view of the foregoing, it is an object of this invention
to provide stator making methods and,
terminal boards, which better protect the
associated insulating inserts, especially during winding
without winding forms, but even when winding forms are
used, if desired.Another problem which may be exacerbated when
winding without winding forms is the possibility that
some winding turns in the axial ends of the coifs, and
especially those winding turns which are intended to fill
the area close to the axial end of the stator and in the
radially outermost portion of the coil, may not be sufficiently
tight or close together to preclude undesirable
vibration of those winding turns during operation of the
finished motor.It is therefore another object of this invention to provide
stator making methods and
terminal boards, which promote tight, regular,
and complete winding and filling of the stator coils, especially
during winding without winding forms, but also
when winding forms are used, if desired.These objects of the invention are accomplished in
accordance

<CLAIMS>
The method of making a stator comprising the steps of providing an annular stator body having a
plurality of radially inwardly projecting poles (14a,14b), wherein adjacent poles define a longtudinal

channel therebetween; lining the surface of such channel with an insulating member (30a);
winding a coil of wire around each pole, the method being 
characterized in that
 it further
comprises the step of mounting on each axial end of said stator body a terminal board

(20) having an edge with a bead portion (40) which overhangs an adjacent axial end of said
insulating member (30a) and ensures that the wire being wound bears

on the terminal board and not on the axial end of
the insulating member on the wire in drawn in a

circumferential direction around the poles of the stator.
The method of claim 1 wherein said terminal board
(20) has a major plane which is perpendicular to

said longitudinal channels when said terminal board
is mo
unted on said stator body and wherein the
longest dimension of said overhanging portion (40)

is parallel to said major plane.
A terminal board incorporated in a stator, the stator comprising a hollow annular stator body (12) having
a plurality of radially inwardly projecting poles (14a,14b) and an insulating member (30a) disposed in

longitudinal channels defined by adjacent poles,
wire coils being disposed around said poles in the longitudinal channels said terminal board being at an axial end

of the stator body and being 
characterized in that
 it is provided with a bead (40),
which extends from the remainder of the terminal

board (20), transverse to the longitudinal axis of the stator body by an amount sufficient
to cover an axial end of the insulating member (30a), the wire wound around the

poles bearing on the terminal board and not on the axial end
of the insulating member. 
The terminal board defined in claim 3 wherein the
insulating member (30a) projects axially beyond the

axial end of the stator body (12), and wherein said
bead (40) is axially spaced from the surface of the

terminal board (20) which contacts the axial end of
the stator body (12) by an amount greater than the

axial projection of the insulating member (30a) beyond
the axial end of the stator body (12).
The terminal board defined in claim 3 wherein said
terminal board (20) has a major plane which is perpendicular

to said longitudinal channels when said
terminal board (20) is mounted on said stator body

(12) and wherein the longest dimension of said
bead (40) is parallel to said major plane.
The terminal board defined in claim 3 wherein said
bead (40) is provided with an axially outward surface

(42) which is inclined relative to both the axial
end of the stator body (12) and the longitudinal axis

of the body (12).
