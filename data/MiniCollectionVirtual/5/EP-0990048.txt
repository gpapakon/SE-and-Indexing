<ABSTRACT>
A direct quantitation of RNA contained in a sample is obtained by capillary electrophoresis of the RNA hybridized to a DNA probe of complementary sequence stabilized by the combination of a fluorophore terminally conjugated to the DNA probe and a dye intercalating the RNA-DNA hybrid so formed. The RNA is quantified by measuring the total fluorescence emitted by the electrophoresed hybrid upon excitation by a laser generated light beam. DNA/DNA hybrids may also be detected by this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of direct nucleic acid detection, particularly RNA in low copy number, without a requirement for amplification of either the number of RNA molecules, or by amplification of a detection signal. The method further utilizes capillary electrophoresis to detect a target RNA-DNA probe hybrid band. The invention also combines laser-induced fluorescence and capillary electrophoresis.The quantitation of RNA, particularly RNA derived from infectious agents or from cellular sources, is important in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease states caused by such agents. For example, the viral load detected in serum correlates to high concentrations of virus in the lymph nodes and has predictive value in assessing progression of AIDS to advanced stages, as reported in Ho, et al., Nature, 373: 123 (1995) and Mellors, et al., Ann. Intern. Med., 122: 573 (1996). Viral titers in serum are also correlated with disease progression for other viruses such as HCV, nonA nonB hepatitis other than HCV, and atypical lentiviruses.There are several fundamental problems in RNA quantitation in low copy number. If there are too few molecules to detect by conventional means, amplification of the target sequence to increase its numbers by several logs is necessary. However, the coefficients of variability (CV) may often exceed 20 percent or more, so that the result obtained is unreliable, and does not correlate with the stage of disease. The coefficient of variability (CV) is defined as the standard deviation of the values obtained divided by the mean. Increased signal from a small number of target molecules is another approach, but the final result depends upon a large number of reactions which must occur in correct sequence. Again, there is a large CV because of reaction sequence errors giving a spectrum of values.Alternatively, direct measurement of the low RNA copy number in the native sample, even where adequate detection sensitivities can be achieved, is thwarted by the inherent instability of RNA-DNA duplexes. Increasing the length of the hybridized target can increase both sensitivity and stability of the hybrid, but the additional nucleotide sequence combinations increase the chance of nonspecific hybridizing to fragments of host nucleic acids or partial hybridization to nonselected regions of the viral genome, thereby contributing to a falsely inflated positive value. Most of the improvements to date in low RNA copy number quantitation represent attempts to better control the multiple
