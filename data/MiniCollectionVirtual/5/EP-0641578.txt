<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable length ski pole (4) includes two telescopically fitted together ski pole 
halves (4a, 4b), and a clamp (16, 116) disposed about the joint between the two pole 

halves. The clamp (16, 116) includes a resilient tubular member (20, 120) having an 
annular sidewall (24, 124) which defines a cylindrical bore (28, 128), where the 

sidewall (24, 124) is formed with a longitudinally extending gap (32, 132) to allow 
the tubular member (20, 120) to be selectively biased to reduce the gap width and 

thus the diameter of the bore, or to enlarge the gap width and thus the diameter of 
the bore. The gap (32, 132) defines first (32a, 132a) and second (32b, 132b) 

opposing sidewall edges having coaxial first (34, 134) and second (36, 136) 
openings respectively. The clamp (16, 116) also includes a pin (40, 140) anchored at 

one end in the first opening to extend with the other end through the second 
opening, and a lever arm (48, 148) pivotally attached at one end to the other end of 

the pin (40, 140), to move between a clamped position, in which the lever arm (48, 
148) lies in contact with the ski pole to bias the first and second sidewall edges 

towards one another, and an unclamped position, in which the lever arm is pivoted 
away from the ski pole to allow the gap (32, 132) to widen. The sidewall edge 

includes a camming surface (44, 144) and the lever arm (48, 148) includes a 
camming knuckle (62, 162) formed at said one end to contact the camming surface 

(44, 144) and force the second sidewall edge toward the first sidewall edge when the 
lever arm (48, 148) is pivoted to the clamped position, to thereby secure the two 

pole halves (4a, 4b) in a fixed position relative to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ski pole, with clamp, which allows for brute adjustment 
of the length of the ski pole and a clamp for clamping about a 
cylindrical shaft. A number of adjustable length ski poles are being proposed, the purpose of such ski 
poles being to accomodate skiers of different height and for skiing under variable 
conditions, with a single set of ski poles. One proposal invokes the use of two 
tubular half sections of a ski pole, fitted together telescopically, and employing a 
detent button disposed on one of the sections and a series of holes spaced 
longitudinally apart on the other section, into which the detent button fits to fix the 
pole at different lengths. The problem with this proposal is that the assembled ski 
pole tends to rattle even though the pole is made with fairly tight tolerances. Also, 
only discreet lengths are possible with such a pole since the different pole lengths are 
determined by the location and spacing of the holes into which the detent button fits. 
Finally, such a pole typically allows the entry of snow and/or water into the holes 
and detent mechanism, resulting in the pole being "frozen" into the length at which it 
is originally set when skiing is begun. Another proposal for an adjustable length ski pole again invokes the use of two 
telescoping halves, with the interior or inside half pole including a plug which 
expands a cone, when the half poles are twisted relative to one another, so that the 
cone contacts the walls of the exterior or outside half pole to prevent the two hall 
poles from sliding relative to one another, i.e., to fix the length of the pole. Although 
this pole design does allow for an infinite number of lengths to be selected, the 
holding mechanism typically does not hold the pole securely at the selected length 
because of different coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials used, difficulty 
in obtaining tight tolerances for the assembled parts, etc. Also, because it is  
 
necessary to tightly twist one half pole relative to the other half pole to secure a pole 
length and to untwist the one half pole in order to loosen and change the length if 
the weather becomes cold it can be difficult to grasp the pole halves in order to 
either untwist them or twist and tighten them, especially since most poles are made 
of aluminum which can be slippery. US-A-4 196 742 which discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1, 
describes a ski-pole or crutch having a pistol-grip handle 
protruding from a tube which is fixed
