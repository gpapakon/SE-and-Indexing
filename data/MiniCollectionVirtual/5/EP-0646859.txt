<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus has an upper print head unit 
and a lower print head unit that print plural printing 

areas in order on a printing medium. The image forming 
apparatus defers printing, as long as the image data 

corresponding to the areas to be printed are not 
transferred from a host apparatus, and begins printing 

when the image data are transferred from the host 
apparatus. The image forming apparatus can thus print 

an unfixed length of continuous image without 
monopolizing the host apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming apparatus and method
which receives image data and forms an image
corresponding to the image data on a printing medium.Conventionally, typical image forming apparatuses such
as printers are line printers which print one page
while receiving input data line by line, and page
printers which print after receiving image data
corresponding to one or more entire pages and storing
the received data in a memory provided for that
purpose. It is conventional that image data is
processed page by page (where the page is of a certain
fixed size), and the image is formed, on the basis of
the image data, on a printing medium such as cut paper
or roll paper.Therefore, when a long, continuous image that is not of
some standard length (e.g., one page of a standard
size) is printed on the printing medium using a
conventional page printer, it is necessary to provide a 
large memory for storing data corresponding to the
image. Further, when such data is stored in a multipage
memory, as in a page printer, the image is not
printed continuously.On the other hand, in a line printer, such an image can
be printed while the data is being received, that is,
data reception continues during printing. However, for
this to be done, the host computer must be occupied in
order to communicate with the printer, until the
printing ends. If the host computer is occupied for
this purpose, especially when the host computer is used
to control plural printers, the waiting time for the
other printers is inconveniently long, and therefore,
the operation of the overall system is not efficient.In addition to the foregoing problems, it takes a long
time to transfer a large quantity of image data from
the host computer to an image forming apparatus such as
a printer, and thus in such a case it takes longer than
desirable to print the image data.The invention provides an image forming apparatus and method
as defined in the appended claims.This invention is designed to overcome the above
problems in conventional structure. It is accordingly
a concern of the invention to provide an image forming
apparatus which can print a long, continuous image of
unfixed length on a printing medium without preempting
the time of the host apparatus longer than necessary.The image forming apparatus according to this invention
can receive image during printing, the time period
while printing is stopped, can be shortened, and a
large amount of continuous image data can be received
by the image forming apparatus in a short time.

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus for receiving image data
from a host apparatus and printing an image on a printing

medium in accordance with the image data, the image
forming apparatus comprising:


receiving means (3) for receiving image data from a
host apparatus;
memory means (9) for storing the image data received
by said receiving means;
printing means (18,19) for printing on the printing
medium by carrying out plural overlapping scans of the

printing medium on the basis of the image data stored in
said memory means; and
control means (6) for controlling the operation of
the apparatus, said apparatus being 
characterised in that

the apparatus is capable of operation in a continuous
print mode in which a continuous image is printed on the

printing medium in response to received image data, said
control means being adapted to control the apparatus in

said continuous mode so that printing by said printing
means is interrupted before the entire image represented

by the image data in said memory means has been printed
and printing is restarted after new image data contiguous

to the previously received image data has been received
and stored in said memory means.
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said
receiving means is adapted to receive a command from said

host apparatus and to change the printing mode of the
apparatus in accordance with the command received by said

receiving means.
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the apparatus
is adapted to operate in another print mode in which

printing of data received and stored in said memory means
is not interrupted.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein
said receiving means is adapted to receive and identify

an image data transmitting signal, a designation signal
for designating the print mode, and an instruction signal

to start printing from said host apparatus.
An apparatus according to any preceding claim
wherein said memory means has at least two memory areas,

and said control means is adapted to control said
receiving means and said memory means such that image

data is received in one memory area when a printing
operation is being performed in respect of data in the

other memory area. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 wherein if image data
for printing is stored in one of said memory areas,

additionally received image data is stored in the other
of said memory areas.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said printing means changes a state of ink by heating,

and discharges the ink as a result of the change of
state.
A method of forming an image comprising receiving
image data from a host apparatus and printing an image on

a printing medium in accordance with the image data, the
method comprising:


receiving image data from a host apparatus;
storing the image data received by said receiving
means in memory means; and
utilising printing means (18,19) to print on the
printing medium by carrying out plural overlapping scans

of the printing medium on the basis of the image data
stored in said memory means; and 
characterised by
controlling the operation of the apparatus such that
the apparatus operates in a continuous print mode in

which a continuous image is printed on the printing
medium in response to received image data
, the apparatus 
being controlled in said continuous mode so that printing

is interrupted before the entire image represented by the
image data in said memory means has been printed and

printing is restarted after new image data contiguous to
the previously received image data has been received and

stored in said memory means.
A method according to claim 8 including receiving
a command from said host apparatus and changing the

printing mode of the apparatus in accordance with the
received command.
A method according to claim 9 including printing in
another print mode in which printing of data received and

stored in said memory means is not interrupted until the
data has been printed.
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 10
including receiving and identifying an image data

transmitting signal, a designation signal for designating
the print mode, and an instruction signal to start

printing from said host apparatus.
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 11
wherein said memory means has at least two memory areas 

and image data is received in one memory area when a
printing operation is being performed in respect of data

stored in the other memory area.
A method according to claim 12 wherein if image data
for printing is stored in one of said memory areas,

additionally received image data is stored in the other
of said memory areas.
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 13,
