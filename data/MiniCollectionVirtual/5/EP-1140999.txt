 TITLE OF INVENTIONCHLAMYDIA ANTIGENS AND CORRESPONDING DNA FRAGMENTS ANDUSES THEREOF5 REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application claims the benefit of 13 U.S. provisional applications: U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/113,280, 60/113,281, 60/113,282, 60/113,283, 60/113,284, 60/113,285, 60/113,385, all of which were filed December 23, 10 1998; and U.S. Provisional Application Nos .60/114 , 050 ,60/114,056, 60/114,057, 60/114,058, 60/114,059, 60/114,061, all of which were filed December 28, 1998.FIELD OF INVENTION15 The present invention relates to Chlamydia antigens and corresponding DNA molecules, which can be used to prevent and treat Chlamydia infection in mammals, such as humans.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 0 Chlamydiae are pro aryotes . They exhibit morphologic and structural similarities to gram-negative bacteria including a trilaminar outer membrane, which contains lipopolysaccharide and several membrane proteins that are structurally and functionally analogous to proteins found in E coli . They are 5 obligate intra-cellular parasites with a unique biphasic life cycle consisting of a metabolically inactive but infectious extracellular stage and a replicating but non- infectious intracellular stage. The replicative stage of the life-cycle takes place within a membrane-bound inclusion which sequesters 0 the bacteria away from the cytoplasm of the infected host cell. C. pneumoniae is a common human pathogen, originally described as the T AR strain of Chlamydia psi ttaci but subsequently recognised to be a new species. C. pneumoniae is antigenically, genetically and morphologically distinct from 

other chlamydia species (C. trachomatis, C. pecorum andC. psi ttaci) . It shows 10% or less DNA sequence homology with either of C. trachomatis or C. psi ttaci .C. pneumoniae is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia, only less frequent than Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Grayston et al . (1995) Journal of Infectious Diseases 168:1231; Campos et al . (1995) Investigation of Ophthalmology and Visual Science 36:1477) . It can also cause upper respiratory tract symptoms and disease, including bronchitis and sinusitis (Grayston et al . (1995) Journal of Infectious Diseases 168:1231; Grayston et al (1990) Journal of Infectious Diseases 161:618; Marrie (1993) Clinical Infectious Diseases. 18:501; Wang et al (1986) Chlamydial infections. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 329. The great majority of the adult population (over 60%) has antibodies to C. pneumoniae (Wang
