<ABSTRACT>
Up until now, such frameworks have been made of very large weld parts which are screwed and pinned together via flanges. In order to avoid heat stresses and to achieve a stable framework structure, it is provided that connection junctions (10, 10a) designed in the form of cups be arranged on a plurality of planes of the framework. A spacer plate (8) is fitted between the connection junction and that end of a load-bearing member (7) directed towards it in each case, the spacer plate being connected in a positively locking manner to both the load-bearing member and the connection junction. A tie rod (13) passes through the load-bearing member (7) and is connected to the connection junction via a screw (17). The spacer plates are provided with means for fastening assemblies, apparatuses or further components of the framework.

<CLAIMS>
Frame for accommodating machines and apparatuses, 
which is composed of horizontally and vertically running 

supports (7) and has connecting nodes (10, 10a) on a 
number of levels, by means of which connecting nodes 

(10, 10a) the supports, which are designed as hollow 
sections, form a positively locking connection, the 

connecting nodes (10, 10a) being designed in the form of 
pots and cylindrical pins (11, 11a) being incorporated in 

the connecting nodes, which cylindrical pins (11, 11a) 
project to a predeterminable extent from a side of the 

connecting node facing the support (7) and engage in 
corresponding cutouts in the support, characterized in 

that onto [sic] a tie rod (13) which is provided with a 

thread at its end passes through the support (7) and in 
that a screw connection exists between the tie rod and 

the connecting nodes, a gap (18) being provided between 
one end of the tie rod and the connecting nodes. 
Frame according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a spacer plate (8, 8a, 8b) is arranged between the 

connecting nodes (10, 10a) and the support (7) facing 
them, is provided with a central through-hole (15) and 

has centring pins (11, lla) passing through it, in that 
the tie rod projects into the through-hole in the spacer 

plate, and in that the spacer plate is equipped with 
means for fixing equipment sets, apparatuses or frame 

structural parts. 
Frame according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the screw which passes through the base (9) of the 

connecting node (10, 10a) is a stud (16) which is connected 
at its end facing away from the base to a tie rod 

(13) which passes through the vertical support (7).
