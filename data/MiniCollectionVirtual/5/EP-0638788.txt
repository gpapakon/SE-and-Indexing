<ABSTRACT>
A sample (14) placed under a microscope (48) is illuminated by 
light from a laser beam (10). Raman scattered light is 

passed back via a dichroic filter (18) to various optical 
components which analyse the Raman spectrum, and thence to 

a CCD detector (12). The optical components for analysing 
the Raman spectrum include tunable dielectric filters in a 

filter wheel (84); a Fabry-Perot etalon (82); and a diffraction 
grating (60). These various components may be swapped into 

the optical path as desired, for example using movable 
mirrors (74,76), enabling the apparatus to be used very 

flexibly for a variety of different analysis procedures. 
Various novel analysis methods are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of operating a spectroscopic apparatus.
It is particularly useful in Raman spectroscopy,
though it can equally be used in other forms of
spectroscopy, e.g. using narrow-line photoluminescence,
fluorescence or cathodo-luminescence.The Raman effect is a phenomenon in which a sample scatters
incident light of a given frequency, into a frequency
spectrum which has lines caused by interaction of the
incident light with the molecules making up the sample.
Different molecular species have different characteristic
Raman spectra, and so the effect can be used to analyse the
molecular species present.A prior Raman analysis apparatus is described in a paper
"Raman Microprobe and Microscope with Laser Excitation",
M Delhaye and P Dhamelincourt, Journal of Raman
Spectroscopy, 3 (1975), 33-43. A sample is irradiated with
monochromatic light from a laser, and the scattered light
is passed through a monochromator in order to select a
particular line of the resulting Raman spectrum. The
monochromator comprises an entrance slit, onto which an
optical system of the apparatus focuses an image of an
illuminated point or line on the sample. A further optical
system focuses an image of the entrance slit onto an exit
slit. Between the entrance slit and the exit slit the
monochromator has a dispersive device such as a diffraction
grating, which has the effect of splitting the incoming
Raman spectrum into a range of angles, depending upon
frequency. The relative positioning of the exit slit and
the diffraction grating thus selects the desired line of
interest in the Raman spectrum.Instead of an exit slit, it is known to disperse the
spectrum across a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. A
CCD is a two-dimensional photodetector array, consisting of 
rows of pixels. As is well known, the reading out of data
from a CCD is a sequential process, in which the charge
accumulated in each pixel as a result of exposure to light
is shifted into its neighbouring pixel along a row, the
data from each pixel in the row being acquired sequentially
by a computer from the pixel at the end of the row. If
desired, instead of using a CCD, the spectrum may be
focused along a one-dimensional (i.e. linear) photodetector
array consisting of a single row of pixels.One disadvantage of the apparatus so far described is that,
if the apparatus is set up to disperse the spectrum widely
across the CCD, to provide high spectral resolution, then
only a part of the spectrum can be received at any one
time. To acquire data from
