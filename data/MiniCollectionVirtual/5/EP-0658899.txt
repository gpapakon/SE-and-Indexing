<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video editing apparatus. More particularly, but not
exclusively, the invention relates to video editing apparatus for use in editing a video
tape under the condition that a plurality of VTRs (video tape recorders), such as video
tape recording and reproducing apparatus, are connected thereto.When video signals reproduced from a plurality of VTRs are edited and
recorded on a video tape of a single VTR, a video editing apparatus having a system
configuration as shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings can be used. In FIG.
1, reference numerals 1 and 2 designate first and second reproducing-side VTRs.
A timing at which the first and second reproducing-side VTRs 1, 2 reproduce video
signals from video tapes is controlled by a controller 7 which controls the whole of
the editing operation of the video editing apparatus.A video signal V1 output from the first reproducing-side VTR 1 is supplied
to a video effector 3. The video effector 3 carries out processing for adding a video
special effect to a picture (referred to hereinafter as "effect processing") under the
control of the controller 7 when necessary. A video signal output from the video
effector 3 is supplied to a video switcher 4. A video signal V2 output from the
second reproducing-side VTR 2 is supplied to the switcher 4.The video switcher 4 outputs an edited video signal V3 
of one system by properly switching the video signals of two
systems under the control of the controller 7 and supplies the
video signal V3 to a recording-side VTR 6, thereby the video
signal V3 being recorded on a video tape. Recording operation
in the recording-side VTR 6 is carried out under the control of
the controller 7. Depending on the system configuration, as
shown by a dotted line in FIG. 1, the video signal V1 output
from the second reproducing-side VTR 2 is also supplied to the
video effector 3 in which the video signals V1, V2 of the two
systems are synthesized.The video signal V1 output from the first reproducing-side
VTR 1 is supplied to and displayed on a first sub-monitor
11. The video signal V2 output from the second reproducing-side
VTR 2 is supplied to and displayed on a second sub-monitor 12.
Further, the video signal V2 output from the video switcher 4 is
supplied to and displayed on a main monitor 13.An audio signal A1 output from the first reproducing-side
VTR 1 and an audio signal A2 output from the second
reproducing-side VTR 2 are supplied to an audio mixer 5 in which
the audio signals A1, A2 of the two systems are mixed
