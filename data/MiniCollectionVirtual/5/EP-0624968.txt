<ABSTRACT>
Telephone apparatus (101) enables the approximately simultaneous
transmission and reception of audio (e.g. from 251) interleaved with image (e.g.

from 231) and graphical annotation (e.g. from 233) signals, in data packet form, over
an analog line (102) which connects the apparatus to a switched telephone network

(103). The audio data packets are transmitted at a periodic rate, during a first time
interval, and the image and annotation data packets are transmitted during a second

time interval, following the first time interval, enabling the simultaneous output of
voice, image and annotation data at the receiver site. Control data packets, as

needed, are also transmitted during the second time interval for end-to-end apparatus

control. One feature enables the transmission of audio data packets at a first periodic
rate, when in an image transmission mode, and at a second periodic rate, faster than

the first periodic rate, when not in the image transmission mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image data transmission and, more particularly, to
the transmission of audio and graphical annotation data along with the image
data.Multi-media is an emerging technology that promises the delivery of
combined audio, video, still images, graphics, text and annotation between users.
Today there exists a variety of still image communication terminals which can be
used over an analog tip/ring telephone line. One such product is the AT&T
VideoPhone 2500 which provides simultaneous real time, color video and voice
communications over an analog line. Another product, the Sony PVT-115
provides voice and image transmission which is not simultaneous and which does
not have graphical annotation capability. Yet another product, the Photophone
from Image Data Corporation has graphical annotation capability but image and
voice cannot be sent simultaneously and also requires an external telephone
interface. The Comtech Lab's Vone has simultaneous voice and still image
capability but does not provide a graphical annotation capability. Thus, there is a
continuing need for terminal apparatus to provide "simultaneous" voice, image
and graphical annotation transmission over an analog telephone line.European patent application publication number 0379354 discloses a two
way communication system having first and second terminals, each terminal
including a camera means for generating video signals, display means for
displaying images, control means for controlling transmission and reception of
signals at each terminal, and line drawing means connected to the control means
for generating a line signal to be transmitted with the video signals.Patent abstracts of Japan volume 014, number 244 (E-0932), 24 May 1990
and JP 02067847A (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation), 7 March
1990 discloses a packet transmission system in which received audio signals are
decoded by receiver and stored in a buffer in order that these audio signals may
be synchronised in the receiver with received video signals. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a telephone
apparatus according to claim 1 and a method of operating a telephone apparatus
according to claim 7.In accordance with the present invention, a telephone apparatus acquires
image, audio and graphical annotation signals which are encoded as a separate
logical channel in data packets for simultaneous transmission over an analog line
connected between the apparatus and a switched telephone network. According
to one aspect of the invention,

<CLAIMS>
A telephone apparatus comprising:

means (220, 240) for acquiring an audio signal, image signal and
graphical annotation signal;
first means for encoding (240) said acquired audio signal into a group of
audio data packets for periodic transmission at a first rate over an analog line

connected to said apparatus;
second means for encoding (220, 260) said acquired image signal, as a
group of digital image packets, and for encoding said acquired annotation

signal, as a group of annotation data packets, and for transmitting said image
data packets and annotation data packets interleaved with said audio data

packets over said analog line 
CHARACTERIZED BY
means (252) for generating a control signal;
third means for encoding (260) and transmitting said generated control
signal as a digital control signal over said analog line; and
means for transmitting the audio data packets in approximate synchronization
with the image and annotation data packets and the digital control signal over

said analog line.
