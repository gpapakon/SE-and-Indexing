<DESCRIPTION>
H3 receptor sites are known and are of current interest to 
those skilled in the art--for example, see: West, Jr. et al., "Biexponential 
Kinetics of (R)-α-[3H]Methylhistamine Binding to the Rat Brain H3 
Histamine Receptor", Journal of Neurochemistry, Vol. 55, No. 5, pp. 
1612-1616, 1990; West, Jr. et al., "Identification of Two H3-Histamine 
Receptor Subtypes", Molecular Pharmacology, 38:610-613; and Korte et 
al., "Characterization and Tissue Distribution of H3 Histamine Receptors 
in Guinea Pigs by Nα-Methylhistamine", Biochemical and Biophysical 
Research Communications, Vol. 168, No. 3, pp. 979-986.. Arrang et al. in U.S. 4,767, 778 (Issued August 30, 1988) 
disclose a pharmaceutical composition containing a histamine 
derivative of the formula: 
 
wherein each of R1, R2, and R4, represents a hydrogen or a methyl, or 
R1 and R2 taken together represent a methylene, and R3 is a hydrogen, 
a methyl or a carboxy, with the proviso that R1, R2, R3, and R4 are not 
simultaneously methyl groups. It is disclosed that the derivatives  
 
behave as complete agonists of the H3 receptors in rat brain and 
produce a maximal inhibition of release identical to that induced by 
histamine (approximately 60%). It is also disclosed that the histamine 
derivatives powerfully inhibit the release and synthesis of histamine by 
very selectively stimulating the H3 receptors. Consequently, according 
to Arrang et al., the derivatives are likely to decrease histaminergic 
transmission in the digestive tract and in the nervous, cardiovascular 
and immune systems. Arrang et al. disclose that the derivatives can be 
used in therapy as a drug having sedative effects, as a sleep regulator, 
anticonvulsant, regulator of hypothalamo-hypophyseal secretion, 
antidepressant, and modulator of cerebral circulation. According to 
Arrang et al., inhibition of the release of inflammation messengers in 
various allergic conditions (e.g., asthma) is expected to result from 
stimulation of the H3 receptors of the lung. It is further disclosed that the 
inhibition of release of gastric histamine is likely to exert antisecretory 
and antiulcerative effects. According to Arrang et al., modification of 
release of the messengers of immune responses is likely to modulate 
the latter responses. EP 0 338 939 discloses compounds of the formula: 
Derwent abstract 86-273706/42 for EP 0 197 840 discloses 
imidazole derivatives of the formula: 
  
 
wherein R1 is H, methyl or ethyl; R is H or R2; and R2 is 1-6C alkyl, 
piperonyl,
