<DESCRIPTION>
 STYRENE POLYMERIZATION INHIBITORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe field of this invention is in the inhibition of the polymerization of styrene during the manufacture of the monomer.Styrene production and chemistry are treated in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1982 (Vol. 21) and numerous other publications.During the production of styrene, inhibitors such as sulfur, dinitrσphenols, and p-tert-butylcatechol have been used in the past as inhibitors. The chemistry of styrene is well-known as one of the earliest of the modern thermoplastics and still one of the largest in volume in production, including many copolymers and polymer blends, such as SBR rubber and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) . Paranitrosophenol (PNP) and dinitro-orthocresol (DNOC) are currently known polymerization inhibitors, but PNP is a solid and DNOC is highly toxic, which has limited their utility.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A solution of PNP in the solvent n-methylpyrollidone (NMP) is a highly effective system for inhibiting the polymerization of styrene and its analogs and for general use in inhibiting polymerization of vinyl and other addition polymerizable monomers during their production from the various feedstocks. PNP in solution in NMP is miscible with both the feedstocks and the monomers produced within certain limits. 

 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A solution of paranitrosophenol in the solvent n-methylpyrollidone is used as a polymerization inhibitor in the production of styrene monomer. Paranitrosophenol is a well known polymerization inhibitor, but it is a solid not soluble in either ethylbenzene or ethylene, which are the usual feed stocks to the styrene process. However, we have found that, by using sufficient quantities of n-methylpyrollidone as a co-solvent, the solubility of the PNP can be increased to a point where it is a commercially viable inhibitor. Hence, both components of the product, the PNP and the solvent, are vital to commercial success.We have found other solvents which may be used, in general these are aprotic very powerful solvents such as dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like, however, none has been as effective in all ways as NMP because of vapor pressures, corrosiveness, or other associated difficulties.Styrene monomer is made from two basic building blocks, benzene and ethylene. Benzene and ethylene are alkylated using an aluminum based catalyst to form ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene is then dehydrogenated,
