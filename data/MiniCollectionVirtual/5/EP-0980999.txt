<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly (1) which includes first and second annular screens (6,7), mounted facing
each other coaxially; the first screen (6) carries a seal member (13) made of an elastomeric

material which includes a main annular sealing lip (14), which extends axially from a root
portion (15) secured on a flange portion (10) of the first screen (6), towards a flange portion (11) of

the second screen (7) facing the flange portion of the first screen; the lip includes an
enlarged portion radially offset with respect to the root portion and delimited by a

circumferential rim and an annular sealing projection (20) with a V-shaped section and its
sealing edge oriented axially, the circumferential rim having a radial annular seat for

a resilient circumferential retaining member, able to exert a predetermined radial
stress on the lip, and the V-shaped projection being arranged alongside the seat for

the resilient member, with the sealing edge (22) towards the flange portion (11) of the second
screen (7), with which it cooperates slidably in an axial direction; the enlarged portion

of the lip is connected to the root portion by an annular portion shaped to form a
resilient hinge, the centre of rotation of which is arranged on a line through the said

sealing edge and forms an angle γ of between 20° and 60° with a radial plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an annular seal assembly of a type intended for
mounting between the drive shaft of a vehicle with a diesel or petrol engine and the
crankcase and/or the oil sump in order to retain the oil.In the prior art, the same type of seal assembly has been used for a long time for this
application, that is one formed by a radial V-shaped spring-loaded lip, which
cooperates slidably or directly with the drive shaft or, in more sophisticated seal
assemblies, with a radial surface of a sealing screen keyed on the drive shaft. In any
case, the seal is exclusively radial and the sealing force exerted by the lip is in direct
proportion to the load of the spring and to the state of wear of the lip.Seal assemblies of the type described have the disadvantage of exerting a
progressively deteriorating sealing action as the lip becomes worn. This limits the
life of this type of seal which is, in addition, sensitive to external contamination and
which is therefore protected by an additional seal assembly, known as a dust shield.
It is clear that this makes running costs relatively high. Seals like that one
shown in US-A-5 348 312 do not overcome the drawbacks
as described above.The object of the invention is to provide a seal assembly free of the disadvantages
described and providing a highly effective seal, which is able substantially to
maintain this high efficiency even as the lip becomes progressively worn, and which
is both inexpensive and compact. This object is achieved according to the invention by providing a seal assembly
as claimed in claim 1.In particular, an enlarged portion of a first lip of the seal assembly of the invention is connected to a root portion by
an annular portion formed so as to constitute a resilient hinge with its centre of
rotation arranged along a line passing through a sealing edge and forming an
angle (γ) of between 20° and 60° with a radial plane parallel to a sliding
surface cooperating with the sealing edge. In practice, the seal assembly of the invention provides an entirely similar seal to
that obtained with prior art seal assemblies (where it is also possible to identify an
angle γ, which is one of the parameters of the seal), with the difference, however,
that the sealing action is provided axially rather than radially and with the further
difference that the seat of the spring which stabilizes the sealing load is rotated
through 90° with respect to the reference plane for measurement of the angle γ.In this way, (as can be demonstrated by a series of
