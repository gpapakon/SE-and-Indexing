<ABSTRACT>
The telephony distributor frame includes profiled bearers on which connection blocks and jumper lead guide rings are mounted. It is characterised in that it includes modules (10) for fixing the guide rings (3A) onto the profiled sections which are considered to be vertical (1), allowing certain guide rings (3A) to be mounted horizontally and on either side of the same profiled section, so as to distribute them over a part of the profiled sections, and the other guide rings vertically over all or part of the profiled sections, and in that each guide ring is provided with a finger (30) for mounting on the module, with two possible orthogonal orientations.
