<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the in vitro diagnosis of allergic, in particular also pseudo-allergic, immunological and environment-related disorders using live biopsy tissue samples. Also disclosed is a mobile incubation device for keeping the tissue samples alive and functioning. The samples can be, for example, skin or mucous membrane particles. The biopsy sample (14) once removed from the patient is placed in a temperature-controlled oxygen-containing incubating medium (16) and an allergen is introduced, triggering an immediate reaction (a so-called type 1 allergy). The secretion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) or a mediator is then determined qualitatively and/or quantitatively. Suitable mediators are histamine, tryptase, ECP, MPO, DAO, TPS, interleukins, prostaglandins or cytokines. The proposed mobile incubation device is provided with a temperature-controllable incubator for sample holders inside a housing. The sample containers can be filled with a nutrient solution. An oxygen-containing fluid is bubbled through feed ducts into the nutrient solution.

<CLAIMS>
A portable incubation device for maintaining the
vitality and functioning of tissue samples, comprising a

compact housing (51) and a lid (52) associated thereto, a
heatable incubator (57), arranged in said housing, for sample

containers (53) which can be charged with a nutrient solution,
wherein said incubation device further comprises oxygen-supply

means (59) which bubble a fluid containing oxygen gas through
lines (60) into said nutrient solution in the sample containers

(53), and energy-supply means (66) which ensure control of the
incubator (57) temperature.
An incubation device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
said incubator (57) has, as heat reservoir, a water bath or a

metal block with recesses to receive said sample containers
(53).
An incubation device as claimed in either of Claims 1
or 2, wherein heating elements (58) are provided in said

incubator (57) for heating thereof, their heat output being
controlled by a thermostat (63).
An incubation device as claimed in any of Claims 1 to
3, wherein said oxygen-supply means (59) comprise one or more

cartridges of a fluid containing oxygen gas.
An incubation device as claimed in any of Claims 1 to
3, wherein said oxygen-supply means (59) comprise a miniature

compressor or a small blower.
An incubation device as claimed in any of Claims 1 to
5, wherein said oxygen-supply means (59) have a line (60) which

terminates in a fine-needle nozzle (62) or a sintered disk in
the nutrient solution (55) in the sample container (53). 
An incubation device as claimed in Claim 6, wherein
said fine-needle nozzle (62) is the needle of a disposable

syringe which forms part of said oxygen line system (60).
An incubation device as claimed in any of Claims 1 to
7, wherein said energy-supply means (66) comprise batteries or

chargeable accumulators.
An incubation device as claimed in any of Claims 1 to
8, which comprises at least one pH-meter and at least one

oximeter to monitor respectively the pH and the oxygen content
of said nutrient solution in at least one of said sample

containers (53).
The use of a mobile incubation device as claimed in
any of Claims 1 to 9 for the in vitro diagnosis of allergic

disorders by allergen stimulation of vital biopsy tissue
samples.
The use as claimed in Claim 10, which comprises

placing the biopsy tissue immediately after it has been taken
from the patient in a temperature-controlled, oxygen-containing

incubation medium located in a sample container of the
incubation device,
adding at least one allergen to the incubation medium for the
purpose of stimulating the biopsy tissue, and
determining qualitatively and/or quantitatively the
immunoglobulin E (IgE) or a mediator released into the

incubation medium after the allergen has acted for a certain
time.
The use as claimed in Claim 11, wherein the mediators
are selected from histamine, tryptase, ECP, MPO, DAO, TPS,

interleukins, prostaglandins or cytokines. 
The use as claimed in either of Claims 11 or 12,
wherein the incubation medium is a Hanks and PIPES/RPMI

incubation medium modified by an addition consisting of

10-40 mM Hepes buffer,
0.5-2% fetal calf serum and
0.1-0.5% human albumin.
The use as claimed in Claim 13, wherein the Hanks
solution addition consists of


25 mM Hepes buffer,
1.0% fetal calf serum, and
0.3% human albumin.
