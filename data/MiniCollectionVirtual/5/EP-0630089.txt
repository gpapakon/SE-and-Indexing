<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing a cable conduit unit from a plurality of cable conduits which are combined by integrally formed connecting webs, by extrusion of an entire flow of thermoplasticized synthetic material emerging from an extruder. The production is carried out with the aid of an extrusion die with tubular channels for forming cable conduits, as well as web channels for forming connecting webs. The entire flow is split into flows which are assigned to the individual conduits. These flows are fed to the conduits. Flow elements are split off from the individual flows and are fed via separate flow paths in the extrusion die to the web channels. The individual flows and the associated flow elements are combined in the region of the outlet from the extrusion die. The invention additionally specifies how tube bundle stabilisation profiles can be integrally formed in the described manner. Devices for the production of corresponding cable conduit units are also described.

A process for manufacturing a cable conduit aggregate 
comprising a plurality of cable conduits (1) which are 

disposed side by side and which are joined by integrally 
formed connecting webs (3), by the extrusion of a total mass 

flow of thermally plasticised synthetic material emerging from 
an extruder with the aid of an extrusion die having flow 

channels (7) which form cable conduits and having slits (22) 
which form connecting webs, wherein the following features are 

put into effect: 

a) the total mass flow is subdivided into mass flows 
associated with the individual flow channels (7) and 

these mass flows are fed to the extrusion die head 
(5), 
b) partial mass flows are branched off from the 
individual mass flows, and are fed to the slits (22) 

via separate flow paths in the extrusion die, 
 
wherein the individual mass flows and the associated partial 

mass flows are combined in the region of the outlet of the 
extrusion die.  

 
A process according to claim 1, wherein tube bundle 
stabilisation profiles (2) are integrally formed and for this 

purpose further partial mass flows are branched off from the 
mass flows, which partial mass flows are fed, via further 

separate flow channels (12) in the extrusion die, to recesses 
(11), which are associated with the profile channels, for the 

formation of the tube stabilisation profiles (2). 
A process according to either one of claims 1 or 2, 
wherein the mass flows and the partial mass flows are 

controlled and/or regulated independently of each other. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in an 
embodiment for the manufacture of a cable conduit aggregate, 

the cable conduits (1) of which have sliding ribs on their 
inner tube walls, which sliding ribs run in the form of 

helical spirals, alternating helical spirals or in the form of 
waves, and which are produced by a correspondingly driven 

inner die (9, 19) which forms sliding ribs, wherein the mass 
flows and the partial mass flows are brought together at the 

location of the inner dies (9, 19) which form the sliding 
ribs. 
A device for carrying out the process according to any 
one of claims 1 to 4, - having a die head (5) which can be 

attached to an extruder, wherein the combination of the 
following features is put into effect:  

 

a) for each cable conduit, the die head (5) has a 
central die mandrel (6) and a die housing (8) which 

surrounds the die mandrel (6) with the formation of 
a flow channel (7) for the mass flow of the 

thermally plasticised synthetic material for the 
cable conduit, 
b) shaping dies (10), which comprise a shaped region 
(11) for the conduit bundle stabilisation profile 

(2) or for the formation of the connecting web (3), 
are situated at the end of the die head (5) from 

which the cable conduits (1) emerge with the 
attached connecting webs (3) or the attached conduit 

bundle stabilisation profile (2), respectively, 
c) for each cable conduit (1), a separate flow channel 
(12) is disposed in the die housing (8) for the 

partial mass flow for the formation of the conduit 
bundle stabilisation profile (2) or for the 

connecting webs (3), respectively, which separate 
flow channel leads into the flow channel (7) for the 

thermally plasticised synthetic material for the 
cable conduit (1) near the shaped region (11) of the 

shaping die (10) for the conduit bundle 
stabilisation profile (2) or the connecting webs 

(3), respectively, 
 
wherein independent control and/or regulating devices (13, 14) 

are provided for the mass flow of the thermally plasticised  
 

synthetic material for the cable conduit (1) and for the 
partial mass flow for the formation of the conduit bundle 

stabilisation profile (2) and the connecting webs (3), 
respectively. 
A device according to claim 5, wherein, for each cable 
conduit (1), a device (25) for centring the inner wall and the 

outer wall of the cable conduit (1) to be manufactured adjoins 
the inlet region of the die head (5), through which centring 

device the mass flow of the thermally plasticised synthetic 
material for the cable conduit (1) flows. 
A device according to either one of claims 5 or 6, 
wherein, for each cable conduit, the die head (5) comprises a 

feeder device (15) having a feeder channel (16) for the 
thermally plasticised synthetic material for manufacturing the 

cable conduit (1), which feeder device is at an angle in 
relation to the die housing (8) with the central die mandrel 

(6), wherein a connecting channel (17) is branched off from 
the feeder channel (16) to the flow channel (12) for the 

partial mass flow for the formation of the conduit bundle 
stabilisation profile (2) or of the connecting webs (3), 

respectively.  
 
A device according to claim 7, wherein the control and/or 
regulating devices (13; 14) for the mass flow of the thermally 

plasticised synthetic material for the cable conduit (1) and 
for the partial mass flows are disposed in the feeder device
