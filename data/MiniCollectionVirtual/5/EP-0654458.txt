<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a process for the isomerisation of linear aliphatic hydrocarbons in which the number of carbon atoms is greater than 6 in order to prepare therefrom branched hydrocarbons thus having a better octane number. The process consists in passing the hydrocarbon, diluted in hydrogen, over a catalyst based on molybdenum oxycarbide which is obtained either from molybdenum carbide which is subjected to a controlled oxidation or from molybdenum oxide MoO3 which is reduced with a hydrocarbon. The advantage of the invention with respect to the catalysts of the prior art is that it makes it possible to achieve a high selectivity towards branched isomers whatever the degree of conversion, which enhances the value of the n-heptane and n-octane petroleum fractions (cuts).
