<ABSTRACT>
In an electroluminescent device which comprises a layer of a semiconductive conjugated polymer between positive and negative charge carrier injecting electrodes, a barrier layer is arranged between the layer of semiconductive conjugated polymer and the charge carrier injecting layer for negative charge carriers. The barrier layer protects the layer of semiconductive conjugated polymer from for example mobile ions released by the reactive charge carrier injecting layer. The barrier layer can in some circumstances also itself be light-emissive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electroluminescent devices and to 
their manufacture and particularly to such devices which have 
a conjugated polymer as the light emissive layer. Electroluminescent devices of the type with which the present 
invention is concerned are described for example in 
PCT/WO90/13148. Reference may also be made to articles by 
Burroughes et al in Nature (1990) 347,539 and by Braun and 
Heeger Applied Physics Letters (1991) 58,1982. These devices offer potential as large-area flat-panel 
displays since they can be fabricated over large areas using 
solution-processing techniques. The basic structure of these 
electroluminescent (EL) devices comprises a polymer film 
sandwiched between two electrodes, one of which injects 
electrons, the other of which injects holes. In the Nature reference the importance of balancing electron 
and hole injection rates through selection of charge injection 
electrodes is recognised. For these polymers, it is clear 
that injection and transport of electrons is less easy to 
achieve than for holes; this was indicated by the 
demonstration of improved device efficiencies when low work 
function metals such as calcium were used as the negative 
contact layer, as explained in the article in Applied Physics 
Letters. From photoluminescence studies it has been 
identified that an important non-radiative decay channel for 
excitons in these polymers is by exciton diffusion to charged 
defects which act as quenching sites. Metal injection 
electrodes can provide many defect states and efficiencies can  
 
be raised substantially by introducing an additional layer 
between the emissive (polymer) layer and the calcium 
(electrode) layer. For this, a molecular semiconductor, 
2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3, 4-oxadiazole 
(butyl PBD) in a poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA matrix has 
been used. This layer served both to prevent exciton 
migration to the metal contact and to enhance electron 
injection. In this context, reference is made to 
"Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Conjugated Polymers: Control 
of Colour and Efficiency", P.L. Burn, A.B. Holmes, A. Kraft, 
A.R. Brown, D.D.C. Bradley and R.H. Friend, Symposium N, MRS 
Fall Meeting, Boston Dec. 1991, MRS Symposium Proceedings 247, 
647-654 (1992). As described for example in PCT/WO92/03490, the contents of 
which are incorporated herein by reference, PPV can be 
chemically-modified to control its bandgap. For example, 
poly(2,5-dialkoxyphenylenevinylene) is red-shifted, by some 
0.4eV, with respect to
