<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of
alkoxylation products by the catalysed condensation
reaction of epoxides (alkylene oxides) and organic
compounds having at least one active hydrogen.A wide variety of alkoxylation products prepared by
the condensation reaction of alkylene oxides with organic
compounds having at least one active hydrogen are of
industrial significance. The products of condensation of
an alkylene oxide, and particularly ethylene oxide or
propylene oxide or mixtures thereof, and an alcohol or a
phenol are well known surface active agents. Other
condensation products find application as solvents, and
functional fluids. Such alkoxylation products are
conventionally prepared by the reaction of at least one
active hydrogen compound with an alkylene oxide (epoxide)
in the presence of an alkaline or acidic catalyst. The
average oxyalkylene chain length of such alkoxylation
products depends on the mole ratio of epoxide to active
hydrogen containing organic compound used and the reaction
results in a mixture of different compounds having a range
of oxyalkylene chain lengths and hence molecular weights.It has long been recognised as desirable to control
the molecular weight distribution of alkoxylates in order
to be able to take best advantage of the properties of
alkoxylates with specific alkylene oxide chain lengths.
Acidic catalysts are known to tend to give narrower
molecular weight distributions than alkaline catalysts but
also promote side reactions which lead to the formation of
undesired by-products. The commonly used alkaline
catalysts are known to give broad molecular weight
distribution but few by-products and are generally the
alkoxylation catalysts used in industry today. Such
catalysts include the alkali metal hydroxides and alkoxides
and in particular sodium and potassium hydroxide.In recent years much attention has been focused on
developing catalysts which are as efficient as the alkali
metal hydroxides but give products with narrow molecular
weight distribution. United States Patent No. 4453023 
describes a process which employs a catalyst comprising a
barium compound and a promoter selected from various oxides
and acids of phosphorus, carbon dioxide and oxalic acid.
International patent application publication number
WO85/00365 describes use of an alkoxylation catalyst
comprising the reaction product of calcium oxide or calcium
hydroxide and an inorganic oxyacid derivative with an
organic compound. European patent publication numbers
