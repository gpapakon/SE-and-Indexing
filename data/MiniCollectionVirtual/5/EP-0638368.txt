<ABSTRACT>
A process for coating composite profiles with powder lacquers, comprising two profile parts of metal and at least one insulator of plastic, interconnecting these profile parts while at the same time forming a heat bridge, comprises the electrostatic application of a lacquer powder to the outer sides of the composite profile and the subsequent sintering together of this powder under the effect of heat to form a lacquer coating. The outer sides of the plastic insulators to be coated have applied to them beforehand a thin, electrically conductive coating which, during sintering of the lacquer powder, improves the adherence of the latter on the insulator. An insulator produced by this process has on its one outer side a thin, electrically conductive coating which, during sintering of the lacquer powder, improves the adherence of the latter on the insulator.

Process for the powder coating of composite 
sections, in particular for frames of windows, doors and 

cladding panels, comprising two metal section parts 
(2, 3) and at least one plastic insulator (4, 5) joining 

said section parts together to form a heat insulation 
bridge, wherein a paint powder is applied 

electrostatically to the outer sides of the composite 
sections and said powder is then sintered together to 

form a paint layer by exposure to heat, characterized in 
that a thin, electrically conductive coating (6) is 

applied beforehand to the outer sides of the insulators 
composed of plastic to be coated, which thin, 

electrically conductive coating improves the adhesion of 
the paint powder to the insulator when it is sintered 

and, in this process, a narrow boundary region (7, 8) is 
in each case left uncoated at the edges of the metallic 

section parts adjoining the insulators.
