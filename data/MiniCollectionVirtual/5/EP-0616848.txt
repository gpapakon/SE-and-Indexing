<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a catalyst composition prepared by 
reacting together: 


(a) a source of a Group VIII metal, 
(b) a compound of the formula (I) 

R¹R²PR⁴CO₂R³   (I)
 
   where R¹ and R² are independently an unsubstituted or 

substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group, R³ is hydrogen, 
an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl 

group and R⁴ is a divalent organic group and 
(c) a source of an anion which is either non-coordinating or 
weakly-coordinating to the Group VIII metal. 
The catalyst compositions are used in the preparation of 
polyketones from carbon monoxide and one or more olefins. Novel 

compounds of the formula { (η³-allyl)Pd(R¹R²PR⁴CO₂R³) ]Y where Y is 

a weakly or non-coordinating anion are useful as such catalysts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catalyst compositions and to 
processes for preparing interpolymers of olefins and carbon monoxide 
by polymerising a mixture of one or more olefins and carbon monoxide 
in the presence of such catalyst compositions. In particular, the 
present invention relates to novel compounds and their use as 
catalysts in such processes. The preparation of linear alternating interpolymers of olefins 
and carbon monoxide having the formula: 
where the R groups are independently hydrogen or hydrocarbyl groups, 
n is at least 1 and m is a large integer, is known from US 3694412. 
Such linear alternating interpolymers, which hereafter will be called 
polyketones, are prepared according to US 3694412 by polymerising a 
mixture of one or more olefins and carbon monoxide in the presence of 
an aryl phosphine complex of a palladium halide and an inert solvent. 
However, the processes described in US 3694412 are slow even at 
elevated temperature and pressure. An improved version of the process described in US 3694412 is 
described in European patent applications 181014 and 121965. It was 
subsequently found that the rate of the polymerisation process could 
be increased considerably by using a palladium catalyst with interalia a bidentate phosphine and the anion of a carboxylic acid having 
a pKa of lower than 2 (as measured in aqueous solution). Examples of 
anions which can be used include trichloroacetate, dichloroacetate,  
 
tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate and p-toluene sulphonate, such 
anions being respectively the conjugate anions of trichloroacetic 
acid (pKa 0.70), dichloroacetic acid (pKa = 1.48), tetrafluoroboric 
acid, hexafluorophosphoric acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid. More recently EP 222454 suggests that any acid having a pKa of 
less than 5 (determined in aqueous solution at 18ºC) can be used. It has now been found that instead of using a bidentate 
diphosphine as described in EP 121965, catalyst systems, in 
particular palladium catalyst systems, for the production of 
polyketones based upon carboxylic acid substituted phosphine ligands 
can be employed. According to the present invention there is provided a catalyst 
composition prepared by reacting together: 
(a) a source of a Group VIII metal, (b) a compound of the formula (I) 
R¹R²PR⁴CO₂R³   (I) 
where R¹ and R² are independently an unsubstituted or 
substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group, R³ is hydrogen, an 
unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group 
and R⁴ is a divalent organic
