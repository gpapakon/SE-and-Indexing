<ABSTRACT>
The external fixation device for osteosynthesis comprises first and second longitudinal bars (3, 4) as carriers for fixation means (5; 10) to the bone (7), a three-dimensional shell (1) attached to the extremity of said first bar (4) and a gliding element (2) attached to the extremity of said second bar (3) having at least three gliding points on each side of said shell (1). In the preferred embodiment the gliding element (2) consists of a first disk (2A) gliding on one side of the shell (1) and a second disk (2B) gliding on the opposite side of the shell (1), both disks (2A, 2B) being connected through a central hole (12) in the center of the shell (1) by means of a threaded extension (2C). The shell (1) and the gliding element (2) are movably arranged to each other in such a way that the free ends of said bars (3, 4) are extending in opposite directions. It enables e.g. motion of the wrist joint about all three axes, while keeping the center of rotation at one point during treatment of the fracture and thus preventing complications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an external fixation device for 
osteosynthesis, in particular for the treatment of distal radius 
fractures. Distal radius fractures are among the most common encountered 
fractures in emergency departments of hospitals. Usually they 
are referred to as Colles or Pouteau fractures. The frequency of 
report is about 10% of all fractures. The most common cause of 
this fracture are a fall on the outstretched hand, a fall from 
height and motorvehicle accidents. The classic method of 
treatment is closed reduction of the fracture and plaster cast 
support. However, plaster cast is only sufficient for fractures 
with no or little displacement and/or comminution. Other 
treatment possibilities include open reduction and plate 
osteosynthesis, functional bracing and external fixation. 
External fixation is mainly applied in comminuted, 
intra-articular and/or unstable fractures. The management of 
distal radius fractures by means of external fixation is based 
on the principle of ligamentotaxis. This means that when a force 
is applied across a joint (e.g. the wrist) by distraction, the 
capsule and ligaments of the joint are placed under tension and 
thus tend to maintain the reduction of the adjacent bone 
fragments.  
 The conventional external fixation devices consist of a rigid 
frame built up from two proximal pins (e.g. Kirschner wires) in 
the radius and two distal pins in the second and/or third 
metacarpal, connected by one or more cross bars. Since this 
configuration of the frame crosses the wrist joint, no movement 
of this joint is possible in presence of the external fixator. 
This can result in severe complications like post-traumatic 
joint arthrosis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (Sudeck's 
dystrophy) and osteoporosis, leading to impairment of wrist 
function and further morbidity. From EP-A1-0 458 486 RICHARDSON a bone fixator frame is known 
which allows relative rotation of the bone segments in two axes. 
Similar single axis frames have been used for the fixation of 
radius fractures. These known fixators do not allow for 
physiological range of movement and require less than optimal 
surgical approach. From the EP-A-248 138 an external dynamic bone fixation device 
is known having a first and a second longitudinal bar as a 
carrier for fixation means to the bone and curved surfaces 
providing relative rotation of the bone segments on one axe.  
 In accordance with the invention an external fixation device 
is provided which will enable e.g. motion of the wrist
