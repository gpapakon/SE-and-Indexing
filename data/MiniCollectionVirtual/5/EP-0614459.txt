<ABSTRACT>
Method for obtaining sesquiterpene lactone, particularly parthenolide (formula I), avoiding deterioration of the compound during extraction and characterized in that plants containing the desired compound are selected and contacted with an extraction fluid, with dissolution of the desired compound, said extraction fluid consisting of a supercritical fluid or a liquid under pressure. The extraction fluid is removed after a suitable contact period, and the temperature and/or pressure conditions are modified to lower the solvent power of the extraction fluid now in a gaseous state and discharged, said desired compound being collected in the form of a solid paste-like or liquid extract.
