<ABSTRACT>
A rubber dome switch assembly has a first contamination resistant sheet (19) 
which overlies a circuit board (14) upon which are switch footprints (18). The 

first sheet is apertured to expose the switch footprints and a second contamination 
resistant sheet (27) overlies the first sheet and has switch closure pads (31) 

on the underside thereof, each of which is adapted to bear against the 
corresponding switch footprint to close the switch. A third sheet (32) 

is adapted to overlie the second sheet and has switch buttons (33) 
formed thereon each adapted to bear against the second 

sheet to force the closure pad into contact with the corresponding switch 
footprint. A faceplate member (37) overlies the third sheet. Means are provided for 

aligning the several sheets, all of which are separable from each other, and 
means are provided for clamping and holding the several elements together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rubber dome, pressure actuated switches and, more
particularly, to such a switch that is substantially contamination free.Rubber dome pressure actuated switches are often used in field consoles and
other telephone applications, most often over rigid circuit boards, especially where the
use of hard plastic keys or hard plastic key caps are not practical, or where their
incorporation into a push button type switch is not economically feasible. In addition,
size and space restrictions often make the use of hard plastic caps unfeasible. It is often
the case that sealants are used to impregnate the rubber dome, but the use of such
materials and the process of impregnation are too costly, especially where the number of
switches is extremely large, as in most telephone applications involving, for example,
telephone consoles or terminals.Heretofore, circuit board assemblies using rubber dome keys have been subject
to mechanical and electrical failures in large numbers over an extended period of use, or
where the use, i.e., actuation of the switch by an operator pressing on the dome, is of a
high frequency of occurrence. Such failures are costly, especially in the field, both as to
replacement of the defective switch and also as to repair of the switch or the circuit
board itself. Thus, in prior art arrangements, any defects necessitating repair of the
switch generally require replacement of the entire circuit board to which the switch is
affixed.Recent studies have shown that the circuit board containing the switch pads and
upon which the switches are mounted and, more particularly, the switch pads
themselves, are being contaminated during use by a foreign substance which chemical
analysis has shown to be squalene, a salt that is expelled through the skin of the human
body, most often as a component of sweat. Squalene is also found in some types of
cosmetics and is thus quite prevalent. This substance or salt has an oily consistency and
a very high viscosity which allows it to be readily absorbed by the silicone rubber of the
domes. Over a period of time or of frequent operation, the rubber dome becomes
saturated with the salt and, upon continued actuation of the switch the salt becomes
deposited on the circuit board, especially the switch pads, and almost invariably leads to 
failure of the switch pads, or even of other components on the circuit board. One type
of rubber dome switch that is susceptible to such contamination is shown in U.S. Patent
