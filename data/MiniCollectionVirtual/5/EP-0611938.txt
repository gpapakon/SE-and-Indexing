<ABSTRACT>
Supports for accommodating and supporting ceramic articles during the firing and optionally the drying process should be designed in such a way that for an acceptable production cost there is a long operating life and also, in the interests of lowering of energy consumption, a low thermal capacity. For this purpose it is proposed that the support be made of sheets of a nickel-chromium-iron alloy which contains from 20 to 35% Cr, from 1 to 20% Fe and 40 to 75% Ni and also optionally further alloying elements.
