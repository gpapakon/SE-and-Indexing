<ABSTRACT>
A monolithic, environmentally stable Mach-Zehnder 
device is formed by threading first and second dissimilar 

optical fibers through the bore of a glass tube. The tube 
is evacuated and heated to collapse it onto the fibers. 

The tube is further heated and stretched at two spaced 
locations to form two couplers that are joined by the two 

optical fibers. The fibers have different propagation 
constants in the region between the two couplers, whereby 

there is a relative delay in the optical signal 
propagating in one of the fibers with respect to the 

optical signal propagating in the other fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to environmentally
stable Mach-Zehnder devices and to methods of making such
devices.There is an emerging need for narrowband wavelength
division multiplex (WDM) couplers and filters. Such
devices are needed in the 1550 nm window for modifying the
gain spectrum of erbium fiber amplifiers. They will also
be widely used in trunk lines as well as in fiber-to-the-subscriber
architectures.There is a need for both wavelength tunable components
and fixed wavelength components. In an all optical
network, for example, the device can be tuned at the
receiver end in order to detect the desired incoming
signal. In a second approach, tunable lasers are used to
send a plurality of signals, and the desired signal is
detected by employing a receiver having a fixed filter.
The transmission system could also employ both fixed lasers
and filters. The wavelength separation capabilities of
such filters needs to be on the order of tens of nanometers
to as small as a nanometer. Moreover, these components
will need to be environmentally stable and very reliable.The Mach-Zehnder filter is known for its narrowband
wavelength capabilities. It has been proposed that filters
having pass bands as narrow as 1 nm be formed by connecting
two evanescent couplers with unequal fiber lengths between 
them. See OFC Conference on Optical Fiber Communication,
Minitutorial Sessions, January 22-26, 1990, page 256 (part
of a presentation on "Dense WDM Techniques" by C. A.
Brackett). It is difficult to achieve reproducibility and
environmental stability with this approach, since the
connecting fibers are subject to external destabilizing
conditions such as temperature changes and random bending
forces.The poster paper WM2 "WDM all-fiber compound devices:
bimodal fiber narrow band tap and equal-arm dissimilar-fiber
unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer" by Hill K.O. et
al., Optical Fiber Communication Conference, 22 - 26 January
1990, San Francisco, California discloses a Mach-Zehnder
device of the type in the first part of claim
1. In the case of this prior art device no protective
structure to minimise unwanted environmental effects
is provided. The preamble of method claim 4 is also
based on this document.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide an environmentally stable Mach-Zehnder device, in particular
a Mach-Zehnder device that is
insensitive to temperature gradients and that is able to
withstand forces that would tend to cause inadvertent
bending. A further object is to provide a method
