<ABSTRACT>
A device for transforming a random succession of unit 
packets into an orderly, regular succession thereof 

comprises: a vertical collection/ raising unit (3) which 
is disposed directly downstream of a conveyor (1) for 

supplying unit packets (2) in a random succession, and 
which forms a stack of unit packets (2); a horizontal 

conveyor/transfer unit (12) with several levels and with 
storage unit functions, which by means of angular 

movement (R) transfers the stack of unit packets (2) from 
the vertical collection/raising unit (3) to a vertical 

discharge/lowering unit (10), which is disposed angularly 
spaced apart in the horizontal plane from the vertical 

collection/raising unit (3), and which deposits one after 
another the unit packets (2) of a stack supplied to the 

latter by the conveyor/transfer unit (12), onto a 
conveyor (11) which outputs the unit packets (2) in an 

orderly, regular succession, the vertical discharge/lowering 
unit (10) being actuated synchronously with the 

output conveyor (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for 
transforming a random succession of unit packets into an 
orderly, regular succession thereof, and which in 
particular are also differently oriented. In particular 
the invention relates to a device of the aforementioned 
type which can also fulfil storage unit functions. In the description and in the Claims, the term 
unit packets means products or sets of products which are 
already packaged or to be packaged. The problem on which the invention is based 
consists in producing a device of the type initially 
described, which permits automatic, direct transfer of 
unit packets output in a random sequence by a production 
or packaging machine, to a further machine downstream, 
for implementation of a subsequent processing or 
packaging cycle, and which operates at a specific rate, 
pace or speed which is different from, or the same as 
that of the machine upstream, without giving rise to the 
need for stoppages of either machine, and safely 
guaranteeing continuous operation of the production 
cycle. In the field of packaging of cigarettes, for 
example, the cigarette packets packaged in the packaging 
machine can be ejected by the latter onto endless belts 
on which the position of the individual packets is not 
defined. The packets often also need to be oriented 
differently. The invention solves the above-described problem, 
by means of a device of the type initially described, 
which comprises: 
a vertical collection/raising unit which is  
 
disposed directly downstream of a conveyor for supplying 
unit packets in a random succession, and which forms a 
stack of unit packets; a horizontal conveyor/transfer unit with several 
levels and with storage unit functions, which by means of 
angular movement transfers the stack of unit packets from 
the vertical collection/raising unit to a vertical 
discharge/lowering unit; the said vertical discharge/lowering unit, which 
is disposed angularly spaced apart in the horizontal 
plane from the vertical collection/raising unit, and 
which deposits one after another the unit packets of a 
stack supplied to the latter by the conveyor/transfer 
unit, onto a conveyor which outputs the unit packets in 
an orderly, regular succession, the vertical discharge/lowering 
unit being actuated synchronously with the 
output conveyor. The vertical discharge/lowering unit is actuated 
synchronously with the output conveyor, and to each step 
of the discharge/lowering unit for depositing a unit 
packet on the output conveyor, there
