<ABSTRACT>
An improved off-the-road pneumatic tire designed 
to be mounted on an associated design rim having a 

flange portion is described. The rim flange has an 

axially inward surface contacting the axially outward 
portion of the bead area of the tire. Each bead 

portion has a surface contacting a radially inner 
portion of the rim flange. The surface and the flange 

initially cease contact and diverge from one another 
at a location in the cross-section of the tire and rim 

and in a region of the flange in which a line L1 
tangent to the flange surface and passing through the 

axis forms an angle in the range of 0° to 15° with a 
radial line L2 passing through the point of divergence 

and perpendicular to the axis. The tire has a steel 
reinforced radial ply which extends between and wraps 

about each bead. The ply has an inflection point 
located radially between a radially outward surface of 

the bead and a radially outward surface of the rim 
flange portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to off-the-road large
pneumatic tires, such as are commonly used on
earthmoving equipment, and more particularly to large
pneumatic tires having a specified clearance
relationship between the lower bead area of the tire
and a flange portion of an associated rim upon which
the tire is designed to be mounted.Large pneumatic tires to be used on earthmoving
equipment, commonly known as earthmover tires, are
well-known. Earthmover tires are required to perform
in difficult environments. When used "off-the-road",
they are required to provide excellent traction for
extremely heavy vehicles pushing, pulling and lifting
extremely heavy loads. The environment is also
fraught with rocks and other sharp instruments which
can damage the tires. Due to the relatively high cost
of these large tires, durability and long life is a
primary design parameter.A second environment in which the tires might be
expected to form is that of public highways.
Sometimes the earthmoving equipment must travel on
public highways as the vehicles travel from
construction site to construction site.Previously, the required strength was built into
such tires through the incorporation of certain curves 
into the molded shape of the exterior of the tire.
These extra curves or bulges were believed to give
extra support to those areas of the tire where
durability was especially important, such as the lower
sidewall, mid sidewall and tread center. In the bead
flange area, the prior art off-the-road tires employed
an interference fit whereby the tire was in contact
along the radially outer surface of the rim flange.
Off-the-road tire engineers conventionally add mass to
structurally improve the durability of the tire.In the aircraft tire art, tire engineers must
always look to reduced mass, due to the unique weight
limitations of that art's area, yet the tires must
still be durable.In US-A-4,790,364 and 4,813,467, an
aircraft tire and rim combination is disclosed which
shows a clearance between a rim flange and the surface
of the bead portion of the tire. However, these
inventions concern aircraft tires which are much
different in construction and application than
earthmover tires. They are also designed to be used
on aircraft rims, such as H-type rims, which are
different in design than earthmover or off-the-road
rims. In addition, the tires shown in US-A-4,790,364
and 4,813,467 do not have inflection points
in the ply, as does the present invention.The present invention also has as one of its
objects improved durability in

inextensible bead (16), the carcass further including a
steel-reinforced radial ply (18) extending between and

wrapped about each bead (16), the ply having turn-up ends
extending axially and radially outwardly from each bead; a

plurality of reinforcing belts (20) disposed radially
outwardly of the ply (18); a tread (12) disposed radially

outwardly of the carcass; the bead portion (90) having a
radially inner first surface (96) and a radially outwar
