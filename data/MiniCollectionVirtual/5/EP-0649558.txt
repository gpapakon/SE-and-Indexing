<ABSTRACT>
A transmission system is proposed comprising at least a coder (101) for coding a signal (10a). The system furthermore comprises at least a transmitter (102), at least a receiver (103) and at least a decoder (104). At least for a coder (101) is at least provided an adaptive prediction filter (10A, 10B) by means of which speech or audio signals are coded while their bit rates are reduced. The filter coefficients for an adaptive prediction filter (10A, 10B) are recursively determined according to the Levinson-Durbin Recursion in fixed point arithmetic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmission system comprising at least a coder
for coding a signal, at least a transmitter for transmitting the coded signal to at least a
receiver, at least a decoder for decoding the coded signal and at least an adaptive
prediction filter.The invention likewise relates to a terminal unit, a coder, a decoder and
an adaptive prediction filter.Such a transmission system can be obtained, for example, without
difficulty from the document "Draft of G.728 Fixed Point Specification" Doc. AH. 93-D.3,
CCITT Study Group XV, London, March 29-30-1993, and from CCITT
Recommendation G.728, "Coding of speech signals at 16 kbit/s using low-delay code
excited linear prediction". The two documents will henceforth be referenced [I] and [II].
Such transmission systems can always be used when multiple use is to be made of a
given transmission capacity. The reduction of the bit rate of a signal during coding
makes it possible, for example, to hold four telephone conversations simultaneously
over one 64 kbit/s transmission channel.The multiple use of a given transmission capacity has very much
importance in radio channels, as will be readily understood if one thinks of the rising
number of subscribers of mobile radio systems. Also the storage capacity of a memory
with an arbitrary storage medium can be used to considerably more advantage when bit
rate reducing coders and appropriate decoders are used, because less storage space is
necessary for storing an information signal.It is known to utilize linear prediction for bit rate reduction. In [I] and [II]
prediction coefficients are computed by an adaptive prediction filter. The computation is
performed segment by segment with the sample values of an auxiliary signal. The
auxiliary signal may be an (electric) audio signal or a speech signal, for example,
coming from a person. Alternatively, it is possible for the auxiliary signal to be a
synthetic audio or speech signal as produced in a coder which operates according to the
principle of "analysis by synthesis". A linear correlation between a predicted sampling 
value (prediction value) of the auxiliary signal and previous sampling values of this
signal is realised with the prediction coefficients. The prediction coefficients are
determined so that the sum of the squares of all the errors computed for a segment of
sampling values assumes a minimum value. An error is here meant to be understood as
the difference between a sampling value and its predicted value. More accurate
descriptions will be given
