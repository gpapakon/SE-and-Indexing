<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for testing the dynamic operational capability of lambda probes, in which the switching times of the lambda probe from rich to lean and from lean to rich is measured and compared with limit values which are dependent on operating points.

Method for checking lambda probes, in which 
method, under working conditions of the lambda control 

circuit, a reference value (BW) is determined from the 
magnitude of the switching times (TS) in which the probe 

signal changes from a rich value to a lean value or from 
a lean value to a rich value and the probe is classified 

as working correctly if the reference value (BW) is lower 
than an assigned limit value, characterized in that a 

switching time (TS) is only taken into account if the 
profile of the probe signal does not have any reversal 

points during the switching process. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the checking of the probe is only carried out if the 

internal combustion engine is in a virtually steady-state 
operating range. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the switching times (TS) are subjected to averaging. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a prescribable number of switching times (TS) are 

added together in order to form the reference value (BW). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the limit value is obtained from a characteristic 

diagram as a function of the operating point, for example 
as a function of the intake air flow and the rotational 

speed of the internal combustion engine. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the switching times from rich to lean and from lean 

to rich are determined separately and separate reference 
values are formed therefrom and the said reference values 

are compared with separate limit values.  
 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the value at which the probe signal has a 

prescribable first fraction of its maximum value is used 
as the rich value, and the value at which the probe 

signal has a prescribable second fraction of its maximum 
value is used as the lean value. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the value at which the probe signal has a 

prescribable first fraction of the value which is 
obtained by a sliding averaging of the maximum values 

measured last is used as the rich value and the value at 
which the probe signal has a second fraction of the value 

which is obtained by a sliding averaging of the maximum 
values measured last is used as the lean value.
