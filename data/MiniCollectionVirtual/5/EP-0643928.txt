<ABSTRACT>
The device for applying adhesive is designed to apply adhesive to specific portions (12) of the surface of a web of cigarette filter paper (1), in such a way as to leave other portions (13) of the surface of the said web, which comprise perforations (11) designed to allow the cigarette smoke to escape, free from adhesive. Slots (notches, indentations) (43) are located on the peripheral surface (42) of a glue applicator roller (4), means being provided to remove the glue from the said slots so that, when the paper web is placed on the applicator roller, those areas of the surface corresponding to the slots cannot deposit any glue on the perforations in the web. Two embodiments of the means are described which enable the glue to be removed from the slots: a first embodiment in which these means consist of studs (pegs) (35) located on the glue transfer roller (3), the studs extracting the glue which has gone into the slots (43); and a second embodiment in which the glue is sucked out (44, 45, 46, 47) via the bottom of the slots (43).

Device for gumming a strip of paper (1), intended 
to gum only given surface portions (12) of one face of said 

strip, leaving other surface portions (13) of said strip 
devoid of glue, the total surface of said gummed portions 

(12) being clearly greater than the total surface of said 
non-gummed portions (13), said device comprising at least a 

transfer roller (21; 3) and a glue-application roller (22; 
4) in rotation and in contact at one of their generatrices, 

said glue-application roller (4) comprising at least one 
peripheral surface part (42) intended to receive a layer of 

glue from the transfer roller (3) and to deposit said layer 
of glue on said surface portions (12) of the strip of paper 

to be gummed,
 
   characterized in that
 
   said peripheral surface (42) of the gumming roller (4) 

comprises hollows (43), means (35; 44, 45, 46, 47) are 
provided solely on the transfer roller (3) or on the glue-application 

roller (4) for removing at least some of the 
glue from said hollows after these have received said layer 

of glue from the transfer roller (3) and before said 
hollows are applied against the strip of paper (1), the 

parts of the peripheral surface (42) constituted by the 
hollows (43) corresponding to the non-gummed zones (13) of 

said strip of paper. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the glue-withdrawing means are made up of projecting studs 

(35) diswposed on the peripheral surface (32A, 32B) of the 
transfer roller (3). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the studs (36) are dismountable, fixing means (37) being 

provided on the transfer roller (3). 
Device according to one of the claims 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the shape and the dimensions of the studs  

 
(35), as well as of the hollows (43), are such that said 

studs are capable of entering the hollows at the time of 
the rotation of the two rollers (3, 4) and to occupy a 

preponderant part of the volume thereof. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the shape and the dimensions of the studs (35), as well as 

of the hollows (43), are such that said studs are capable 
of entering the hollows gradually at the time of the rotation 

of the two rollers (3, 4). 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the corresponding surfaces of the studs (35) and the 

hollows (43) are approximately oval. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the studs (35) are disposed in pairs 

on generatrices of the transfer roller (3) and correspond 
to hollows (43) disposed in pairs on generatrices of the 

glue-application roller (4). 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the number of pairs of studs (35) is different from the 

number of pairs of hollows (43). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the glue-withdrawal means are made up of a suction pump 

(47) suctioning the glue through tubes (44, 45) connected 
at the bottoms of the hollows (43) via a rotary suction 

distributor (46). 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the rotary suction distributor (46) is capable of activating 

the glue suction (47) in the hollows (43) during a 
portion of a revolution of the glue-application roller (4), 

from the moment when the layer of glue has just been deposited 
on the glue-application roller until the moment 

when it is about to be deposited on the strip of paper (1), 
the suction (47) not being activated over the rest of the 

portion of a revolution.  
 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the transfer roller (3) or the glue-application 

roller (4) further comprises a central cylindrical 
portion (33) and two lateral cylindrical portions 

(34A, 34B), the diameters of which are equal but greater 
than the diameter of the cylindrical surface portions (32A, 

32B; 42) of the transfer roller or of the application 
roller corresponding to the zones of the strip of paper 

intended to be gummed (12). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one cylindrical part (30, 

40) of the transfer roller (3) and/or of the glue-application 
roller (4) is of synthetic material. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it further comprises a glue-feeding 

vat (20) in which part of the transfer roller (21; 3) is 
immersed. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that it comprises one or more nozzles (24) 

for feeding a roll of glue (23) disposed upstream, near the 
line of contact of the two rollers.
