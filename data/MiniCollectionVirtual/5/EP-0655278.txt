<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a material comprised of silicotitanates having a crystalline structure similar to MCM-41 
zeolites, said material being 

characterized in that it contains in its lattice atoms of titanium and channels in its porous structure whose average sizes exceed 10 Å making possible its utilization 
in catalytic reactions wherein are involved large organic molecules, such as the oxidation of olefins to epoxides and glycols, alcohols to cetones, thio-ethers 

to 
sulfoxides and sulfones, and phenol to catechol and hydroquinone, and if A1 is introduced into the structure it is then possible to prepair bifunctional catalysts
 
"oxidant-acid/base". In order to obtain such product, and aqueous solution is used which contains the ion NR₁R₂R₃R₄⁺ as well as another aqueous solution which 

contains tetramethyl amonium hydroxide and a silica source (e.g. aerosil®). After homogenization, more silica is added, as is the Ti source [e.g. Ti(C₂OH₅)₄]. The 

resultant gel is heated in an autoclave at a temperature between 80 and 200
º
C. The obtained gel is activated by roasting between 350 and 800
º
C. It is used for catalytic 
oxidation.

<DESCRIPTION>
Zeotypes, catalytic oxidationIt has been recently revealed that silicotitanate
and silicoaluminate isomorphs with zeolites with MFI and
MEL structures (patent US 4410501) are active for selective
oxidation with H2O2 of olefins, alcohols, as well as
for hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, amoxydation of
ketones in the presence of NH3 and oxidation of alkanes
to alcohols and ketones (U. Romano, A. Espósito, F.
Maspero, C. Neri and M.G. Clerici, Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal.
55, 33 (1990.)) These materials are formed by a bidirectional
system of channels with a pore diameter in the
neighborhood of 5.5 Å, which imposes geometric restrictions
and limits the size of the molecules to be oxidized.
In these silicotitanates, it has been proposed that the
active centers be Ti=O species bonded to the lattice.The possiibilities of these materials as oxidation
catalysts have been increased, as a silicoaluminotitanate
isomorph to Beta zeolite, which has a three-dimensional
system of channels whose diameter is 7.3 x 6.0 Å (polytype
A), or 7.3 x 6.8 Å (polytype B) for the channels
parallel to the crystallographic axes a and b and 5.6 x
5.6 Å (polytype A) or 5.5 x 5.5 (polytype B) for the channels
parallel to axis C has been synthesized (M.A. Camblor)
A. Corma, J. Pérez-Pariente, Spanish patent P9101798; M.A.
Camblor, A. Corma, J. Pérez-Pariente, J. Chem. Soc. Chemical
Comm. (1992) 557.) This Beta-Ti allows the oxidation
of larger sized molecules than Titanium silicalite, but
even so its possibilities are limited to molecules of a
size, which is at the most the diameter of the channels There is no doubt that in the field of fine chemistry,
it is necessary to oxidize molecules with an effective
dieter larger than 6.5 Å, which would have diffusional
limitations, even in the Beta-Ti. Hence, it
turns out to be of great interest to synthesize molecular
sieves with a pore diamter larger than 6.5 Å and
with Ti in the lattice. These materials could act as
selective oxidation catalysts of molecules of interest
in the field of organic chemistry.The material to which the present invention refers
has a MCM-41 type structure like the one described in
patents US 5,098,684, US 5.102,643 and US 5,108,725, but
it has in its lattice titanium atoms (like patent ES
9101798) and, also has channels with an average dimension
larger than 10 Å. The presence of Ti=O bonds in the
material converts it into a catalyst suitable for selective
oxidatons like the ones mentioned in patent ES 9101798,
at the same time that the large diameter of the channels
