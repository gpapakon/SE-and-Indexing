<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to
refrigerants, and more specifically relates to
compositions of refrigerants based on azeotropic and
zeotropic mixtures containing hydrofluoropropanes and
hydrofluoroethers, and hydrocarbons.The most common currently used refrigerants
have been chlorine-containing fluorocarbons (CFCs), such
as CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-114, and CFC-115. The presence of
chlorine in these compounds causes them, once released
into the atmosphere, to deplete the Earth's stratospheric
ozone layer. As a result of their harmful effects, the
use of CFCs is being phased out of production. For
example, in the United States, the diminished use of CFCs
is mandated by the Montreal Protocol, a multi-national
agreement to which the United States is a party; the
terms of this treaty were codified by the Clean Air Act
of 1990.Research has focused on alternative
non-chlorinated refrigerants. The physical
characteristics of a ideal refrigerant include low
boiling point, low or non-flammability, high thermal
stability, high chemical stability with other compounds
to which it is exposed, low toxicity, and high energy 
efficiency. Suggested alternatives to CFCs have included
hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), see Eiseman, Jr., U.S. Patent
No. 3,362,180; O'Neill et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,961,321;
Powell, U.S. Patent No. 4,559,154; hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), see Walters, U.S. Patent No. 4,157,979; Japanese
Patent No. 2272-186; azeotropic mixtures of HFEs and HFCs
with CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), see
Fellows et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,948,526; Murphy et al.,
U.S. Patent No. 4,054,036; Snider et al., U.S. Patent No.
3,536,627; Eiseman, Jr., U.S. Patent No. 3,409,555
(although HCFCs are also being phased out by the 1990
Clean Air Act); and isolated azeotropic mixtures, see
Eiseman, U.S. Patent No. 3,394,878 (mixture of
trifluoromethyl methyl ether and trifluoromethyl
pentafluoroethyl ether); Shankland et al., U.S. Patent
No. 4,978,467 (mixture of pentafluoroethane and
difluoromethane); Hutchinson, U.S. Patent No. 3,922,228
(mixture of difluoromethyl trifluoromethylether and
dimethyl ether).These alternative refrigerants represent a wide
range of boiling points; nevertheless, suitable
replacements do not exist for all CFC and HCFC
refrigerants. Problems researchers have encountered
include the difficulty of manufacturing these
refrigerants and the lower energy efficiency associated
with many of them. Accordingly, new refrigerants that
satisfy specific refrigeration requirements are always
desirable. Corresponding
