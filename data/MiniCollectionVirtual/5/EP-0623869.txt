<ABSTRACT>
A battery powered computer system which monitors the 
address bus to determine when a peripheral device has not 

been accessed for a preset amount of time is described. 

When the preset amount of time has passed the system enters 
a reduced power consumption state by at least reducing 

power to the peripheral device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a computer system
and a method for reducing the
power consumption of the computer system.Computer systems are rapidly developing the
capabilities of conventional desktop or floor mounted
personal computer systems. Hard disk units are being
integrated into portable computers, because of the large
amounts of information being processed and the large size
of many applications programs. At least one floppy disk
unit is integrated in the vast majority of portable
computers, even if a hard disk unit is installed, to allow
loading of information and use of applications requiring
key disks and of diagnostic programs. Modems have been
integrated into computers for some time, to allow
communications and information transfer between the user
and a remote location, for example, the home office. More
complex circuitry is being installed in computers to
support these improved peripheral devices and to support
the increased speeds and capabilities of the
microprocessors utilized in the portable computer systems.The various peripheral devices and high speed
circuitry mentioned above consume large amounts of power
when operating. Using CMOS components has helped to reduce
the power consumption of the circuitry, but even the use of
CMOS components is insufficient at the clock speeds and
performance levels of available circuitry.Various alternatives were tried to resolve the
problem. For example, the IBM Corporation PC Convertible
included a switch which the user could press to place the
computer system in a standby mode in which the system clock
to the CPU was halted and various peripherals turned off,
but the system controller, which controlled the keyboard,
system clock, interrupts, speaker drive,and I/O control
remained operational to receive interrupts. Additionally
the PC Convertible also entered the standby condition after 
periods of activity based on monitoring the timing of
interrupts by a software dependent process. However, the
PC convertible was relatively simple, with a low level of
functionality as compared to what is currently available
and the requirement of a user action limited its use to
circumstances where the user remembered to depress the
switch. Another widely used example was blanking the
display after a period of keyboard inactivity which saved
power as well as prolonged the life of the display. Also,
a hard disk unit was developed which reduced the power used
by the controlling electronics by utilizing only certain
portions of the track for servo information and turning
