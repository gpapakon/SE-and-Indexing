<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for generating a pulsating 
air by communicating an air passage intermittently by 

rotating a valve (4, 4A, 4B) while feeding air into a casing 
or discharging air from the casing (3, 3A, 3B, 3C) by a 

blower (6) connected to a connecting port of the casing (2a 
- 2g). The air passage extends from the connecting port for 

the blower (2a - 2g) to a transmitting port (1, 1A, 1B) of 
the casing (3, 3A, 3B, 3C) for transmitting a pulsating air. 

The apparatus for generating a pulsating air is comprised of 
a casing (3, 3A, 3B, 3C) provided with a connecting port for 

a blower (2a - 2g) and a transmitting port for a pulsating 
air (1, 1A, 1B). The connecting port (2a - 2g) is connected 

with a feeding side of the blower (6) or a suction side of 
the blower (6). The valve (4, 4A, 4B) is designed to be 

operated so as to intermittently communicate the air 
passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for generating pulsating air, referred to
herein as a pulsating air generator.Middle or low frequency pulsating air increases the efficiency of heating and
drying treatment of powdered or granular materials when operated on the materials
while they are heated or dried. Besides that, pulsating air can be applied to
remove dust and the like mixed with powdered or granular materials or to remove
dust and the like attached on the surface of articles and machines, and pulsating
air is expected to be utilized in various fields in future.A speaker type pulsating air generator which generates air oscillation by
electrically vibrating a cone and a diaphragm type generator which produces air
oscillation by reciprocating a diaphragm of a desired figure by utilizing the spring
power or the electro-magnetic power of a solenoid have been proposed.However, the oscillating pressure of pulsating air produced by such a speaker type
or a diaphragm type generator has been very low because the cone has been merely
vibrated or the diaphragm has been merely reciprocated. It has been in practice
difficult to utilize a pulsating air of such a low pressure for various fields of
industry due to the fact that the pulsating air doesn't work effectively when utilized
to remove dust attached on articles.A diaphragm can be enlarged, for example, to heighten the oscillating pressure of 
a pulsating air. However, there has been a definite limit to heightening the
oscillating pressure and sufficient pressure can't be obtained when the air
oscillation is generated by the movement of the diaphragm. Further the whole
apparatus becomes too large to handle easily when a large diaphragm is used.
Still further, mechanical vibration and noise of the whole apparatus caused by
reciprocation of an enlarged diaphragm become large. Therefore, enlarging a
diaphragm has inconveniences and also can't solve the above-mentioned problems
appropriately.US-A-4 881 574 discloses a pulsating air generator with
the features of the preamble of claim 1.The present invention has been proposed in view of the above-mentioned
problems. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to generate a
pulsating air of high oscillation pressure by a facile and compact apparatus.In this specification, one of most typical pulsating air is a stationary wave of
middle or low frequency.According to the invention, there is provided a pulsating air generator of the axial
flow type comprising a casing having an exit port for applying
