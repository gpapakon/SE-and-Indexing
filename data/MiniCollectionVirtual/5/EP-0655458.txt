<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a new process for producing finasteride which 
involves reacting the magnesium halide salt of 17β-carboalkoxy-4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one 

with t-butylamino magnesium halide, present 

in at least a 2:1 molar ratio to the ester, formed from t-butyl amine and 
an aliphatic/aryl magnesium halide at ambient temperature in an inert 

organic solvent under an inert atmosphere followed by heating and 
recovering the product finasteride. 
Also disclosed are two polymorphic crystalline Forms I and 
II of finasteride, and methods of their production.

<DESCRIPTION>
Finasteride, marketed under the tradename of PROSCAR®,
by Merck & Co., Inc is 17β-(N-tert-butyl carbamoyl)-4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one
and is a 5α-reductase inhibitor for use in treating acne, female
hirsutism, and particularly benign prostatic hyperplasia. See US Patent
4,760,071 (1988), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference..The synthesis of finasteride in US Patent 4,760,071 involves
reacting the 17β-(2-pyridylthio) carboxylate of 4-aza-5α-androst-1-ene-3-one
with t-butylamine. A further synthesis of finasteride is described in
Synthetic Communications, 30 (17), p. 2683-2690 (1990).
including the
reacting of the 17-acylimidazole of 4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one with t-butylamine.However, both of these reactions require the use of
heterocyclic aromatic amines which are expensive and give rise to
environmental safety and toxicity considerations. Both of these
intermediates are prepared from the 17β-carboxylic acid.The Bodroux reaction, described by F. Bodroux in
the references, Bull. Soc. Chim. France 33, 831 ( 1905); 35, 519 (1906);
1, 912 (1907); Compt. Rend. 138, 1427 (1904); 140, 1108 (1905); 142,
401 (1906) discloses the reaction of the magnesium halide salts of amines
with esters. However, there is no description or teaching that the reaction
can be applied to the reaction of a sterically hindered amine, e.g. t-butyl
amine, with a sterically hindered ester such as 1.What is desired in the art is a method of synthesis of
finasteride, which is environmentally safe and non-toxic, and does not
utilize an aromatic heterocyclic amine. Preferably, the starting
compound could be the 17-beta ester, (1) which would eliminate one step
of the process in producing the above heterocyclic intermediates. By this invention, there is provided a process for producing
finasteride 2
wherein R is C1-C10 linear, branched or cyclic alkyl, unsubstituted or
substituted with one or more of phenyl, comprising the steps of:
(1) contacting the ester 1 with t-butylamino magnesium halide, wherein
the molar ratio of t-butylamino magnesium halide to ester is at least
about 2:1, in an inert organic solvent under an inert atmosphere;(2) maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature of at least
10 °C; and(3) recovering the product finasteride 2.Also provided are intermediate compounds useful for the
synthesis of finasteride.We have discovered that the 17β-carboalkoxy ester of 4-aza-5-alpha-androst-1-en-3-one
(1) can be reacted with t-butyl amine together
with an aliphatic/aryl magnesium halide reagent,
