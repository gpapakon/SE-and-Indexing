<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel poly(3-hydroxybutyrates)
and blends with other polymers. The
present invention further relates to a process for the
production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrates) in the
substantial absence of water in the presence of an
anionic initiator. The present invention also relates
to biodegradable articles produced from the poly(3-hydroxybutyrates).Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) are naturally occurring
thermoplastic polymers currently isolated from bacteria
and other microorganisms. Unlike many thermoplastic
polymers, poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) and in particular
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) have been shown to be
biodegradable and environmentally non-persistent.
Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) have the additional feature of
being both thermally and hydrolyticly unstable and thus
can degrade without microbial intervention. However,
the high cost of processing and isolating poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates)
derived from natural sources has
inhibited the wide spread use of these biodegradable
polymers in commercial applications. A low cost
synthetic method for the preparation of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates)
is, therefore, highly desirable.Previous attempts at the production of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates)
by the polymerization of β-substituted-β-propiolactones
generally fall into two
categories, acid catalyzed reactions generally
characterized by the use of Lewis acid catalysts 
containing metals such as aluminum or zinc, or anionic
ring opening polymerizations. Examples of acid
catalyzed polymerization of β-substituted-β-propiolactones
can be found in the work of Tani et al.
(Macromolecules, 10, 275 (1977) and Lenz et al.
(Macromolecules 21, 2657,(1988).The Lewis acids most frequently used in the acid
catalyzed polymerizations have included
triethyaluminium/water complexes (often referred to as
aluminoxanes) and diethyl zinc/water systems as well as
transition metal alkoxides such as aluminum
triisopropoxide.Examples of anionic ring opening polymerization of
β-substituted-β-propiolactones can be found in the work
of Tani et al. (Macromolecules, 10, 275 (1977),
Kricheldorf et al. (J.Macromol. Sci.-Chem, A26, 951
(1989), and the work of Jedlinski et al.
Macromolecules,24, 349, 1991). These references
generally disclose that anionic ring opening
polymerization occurs via nucleophilic attack at the β-carbon
of the β-substituted-β-propiolactones. However,
this type of polymerization is slow and produces low
molecular weight polymers. Tani et al. also disclose
that the anionic ring opening polymerization of β-alkyl
