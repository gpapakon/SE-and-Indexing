 in which R1, R2 and R3 independently of one another are each hydrogen, a C1-C12-alkyl group, a C1-C12-alkoxy group, a C1-C12-alkylthio group, a C5-C8-cycloalkyl group, a C5-C8-cycloalkoxy group, a C5-C8-cycloalkylthio group, a C6-C10-aryl group, a C6-C10-aryloxy group, a C6-C10-arylthio group, nitro, halogen, cyano, -COOH, -COOR7, -NR8R9 or -CONR8R9, where R7 is C1-C20-alkyl, C5-C8-cycloalkyl, phenyl or phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl, and R8 and R9 independently of one another are each hydrogen, C1-C8-alkyl, phenyl or phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl, X is nitrogen or CR4, Y is nitrogen or CR5 and Z is nitrogen or CR6, where R4, R5 and R6 independently of one another are each hydrogen, a straight-chain or branched C1-C12-alkyl group or a C6-C10-aryl group and where, if X is CR4 and Y is CR5 and Z is nitrogen or CR6, or if Y is CR5 and Z is CR6 and X is nitrogen or CR4, R4 and R5 or R5 and R6 in each case together also form a group -CH=C(R10)-C(R11)=CH- or a tetramethylene group in which R10 and R11 independently of one another are hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, phenyl or phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl, are disclosed. The compounds are suitable as active constituents in thermal information recording methods, particularly for laser optical memories.
