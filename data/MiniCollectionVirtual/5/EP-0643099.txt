<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to rubber compositions particularly suitable for 
tyre treads having an improved balance of properties such as rolling 

resistance, grip and wear. 
It provides a vulcanisable rubber composition which is obtained by 
mechanical blending of a rubbery polymer, vulcanisation agent, filler and 

coupling agent, the filler comprising silica and the coupling agent being at 
least bi-functional whereby it can react with the silica and with the 

polymer, the temperature of the composition being maintained below 
130°C during the mechanical blending stage. 
The invention also provides a method of making such a vulcanisable 
rubber composition and a tyre having a tread formed by the vulcanisation 

of such a rubber composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
method of making vulcanisable rubber compositions, e.g. for the
manufacture of tyre treads.It is well known that it is desirable to reduce the rolling resistance of
a motor vehicle tyre in order to achieve reduced fuel consumption.
However, it is also well known that reductions in rolling resistance are
normally achieved at a cost, namely reduced tyre grip and/or reduced wear
resistance.Previous proposals to reduce the rolling resistance of a tyre have
included reducing the amount of carbon black in the head composition,
using a carbon black of relatively low surface area and adding a polymer
with a relatively low glass transition temperature. None of these proposals
has been entirely successful since, for example, a typical consequence is
an undesirable reduction in tyre wet grip.In EP-A-0547344 is disclosed a vulcanisable rubber composition
comprising a non-conjugated ethylene-propylene-diene rubber with a
cross-linker, an alkoxysilane and a silica or siicate filler in which mixing
and vulcanisation temperatures disclosed are conventional. US-A-4430466 discloses a sulphur-vulcanisable diene rubber
composition including a siliceous filler, silane coupling agent and an
accelerator in which the temperatures reached after blending the
ingredients are from 150° to 160°C.AT-B-392,795 also discloses a mixture of cross-linkable nibber,
sulphur, silane coupling agent and silica filler, again with a conventional
blending stage.EP-A-0028911 discloses a vulcanisable rubber composition
including silane, silica and carbon black that is particularly intended for
use in a belt. Again its teaching of the blending stage is conventional.There remains a need to improve tyre tread compositions to achieve
a better overall balance of properties, in particular to improve, i.e. reduce,
rolling resistance without impairing other properties such as the above-mentioned
grip and wear.Accordingly, the invention provides a method of making a
vulcanisable rubber composition in which a rubbery polymer is
mechanically blended with filler, vulcanisation agent and coupling agent,
the filler comprising silica and the coupling agent being at least bifunctional
to react with the silica and with the polymer, characterised in
that the temperature of the composition during said blending is maintained
below 130°C. The coupling agent may be pre-coupled with the silica prior to the
mechanical blending stage or it may couple in situ during the mechanical
blending stage and/or a later vulcanisation stage.Normally the
