<ABSTRACT>
In the case of casting moulds produced on moulding machines, it is often necessary to integrate into the production cycle separate apparatuses for making a filling hole and vent holes, which have to be made in the upper side of the casting mould located in the cope. The invention specifies an apparatus by means of which both types of hole are made in succession in adjacent working positions of the conveying device. The apparatus requires only a single positioning device, the two types of tool being mounted at different ends of a tool carrier guided on a crossbeam.

An apparatus for producing openings, for example casting openings and venting bores, in
a casting mould of compacted moulding sand present in a top box of a mould and preferably

produced in a moulding machine, wherein moulding boxes, in particular a top box
of the mould alternating in each case with a bottom box of the mould, are movable in a

clock-timed manner into an operating area by means of a suitable conveying device by
way of the apparatus, wherein the apparatus is provided with a positioning device, with

the aid of which tools (3, 5) for forming the openings are movable in the transverse and
longitudinal directions of the casting mould, [and]
 a first tool (3) for producing a casting
opening or the like and a second tool (5) for producing a venting bore or the like are provided

on a common tool support (
WT
) of the positioning device,
characterized in that

the two tools (3, 5) are arranged in the same direction on the common tool support (
WT
)
and can be locked separately, and the horizontal distance of the tools (3, 5) arranged on

the common tool support corresponds approximately to one conveying cycle (
T
) of the
conveying device, so that one tool (3, 5) can be actuated in a first operating positioning

of a top box (1) of the mould determined by the conveying device (
FE
) and the other tool
(5, 3) can be actuated in the following operating positioning of the same top box (1) of

the mould determined by a conveying cycle (
T
) in order to produce a respective opening
in the casting mould in each case.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the tools (3; 5) are provided in
such a way as to result in a tool advance (
WV1
; 
WV2
) directed vertically upwards.
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 a separate drive (2; 4) is
provided for each tool advance (
WV1
; 
WV2
).
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the tool support
(
WT
) is designed in the form of an arm which is movable in and transversely to the conveying
direction (
FR
) of the casting mould on a cross-member (
TR
) of the positioning
device.
An apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the cross-member (
TR
) is provided
on a stationary frame (
GE
) of the positioning device on which the drive (6) for the 
tool support (
WT
) is also situated.
An apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the tool support (
WT
) is
displaceable on the cross-member (
TR
) in such a way that at least one of the tools (3; 5)
can be positioned in [such]
 a position that the top of the casting mould can be machined
at any desired point.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the movability of
the tool support (
WT
) in the conveying direction (
FR
) is at least as great as the length
(
T
) of a conveying cycle.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in tha
t one tool (3; 5) is
arranged on the tool support (
WT
) in front of the cross-member (
TR
) in the conveying
direction (
FR
) and the other tool (5; 3) is arranged on the tool support (
WT
) behind the
cross-member (
TR
) in the conveying direction (
FR
).
An apparatus according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the axial distance (
A
) of the
tools (3; 5) in the conveying direction (
FR
) is at least equal to the length (
T
) of a conveying
cycle.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 8 and 9, 
characterized in that
 the tools (3; 5)
are secured to the ends (
E1
; 
E2
) of the tool support (
WT
).
