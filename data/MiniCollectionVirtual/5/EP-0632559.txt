<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a negative-sequence
time-overcurrent relay which is adapted for use
with a polyphase synchronous rotary electric machine, such
as a polyphase synchronous motor, polyphase synchronous
generator and polyphase synchronous condenser, and protects
the polyphase-synchronous rotary electric machine.With regard to a synchronous rotary electric
machine, the withstanding of negative sequence current
is defined as follows.
As is known for example from US-A-4 210 948, when
a negative sequence current
flows across the armature winding, a rotating field is
generated on the rotator, causing an induced current to
flow on the surface of the rotator. The surface temperature
of the rotator therefore rises. To restrict
the rising of the surface temperature of the rotator,
the negative sequence current should be restricted.There are two ways of restricting the negative
sequence current: short withstanding for restricting a
relatively large negative sequence current in a short-time
where the effect of the heat discharged from
the rotator is negligible and continuous withstanding
for restricting a relatively small negative sequence
current for a long period of time or continuously
where the effect of the heat discharged from
the rotator appears.When a harmonic current flows across the armature
winding of a synchronous rotary electric machine, 
a rotating field having a frequency several times
greater than that of the fundamental wave is generated
in the rotator. Consequently, an induced current flows
on the surface of the rotator, causing the surface temperature
of the rotator to rise. Like the restriction
of the negative sequence current, the harmonic current
is also restricted.Therefore, the characteristics of a synchronous
rotary electric machine are restricted by a total negative
sequence current (I2), which is the total influence
of the negative sequence current of the fundamental wave
and the harmonic current.When the fundamental-wave negative sequence current
(I2Â·1f) and an arbitrary harmonic current (Inf: n being
the order number of the harmonic) flow in a synchronous
rotary electric machine, the amount of their influence,
if expressed as as the total negative sequence current I2,
is defined by the following equation (1). Here the
total negative sequence current I2 is the amount of the
influence of the fundamental-wave negative sequence
current and an arbitrary harmonic current on the
synchronous rotary electric machine, expressed by the
fundamental-wave negative sequence current which
