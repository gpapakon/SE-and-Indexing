<ABSTRACT>
The fryer has a container (1) for the frying fat, in which a container (6) for the material to be fried is inserted from the top. In the container for fat (1) an upwardly and downwardly open insert (10) can be placed, which between its two side walls (11) and the oppositely located heated side walls (8) of the container (1) defines an intermediate space. The frying fat performs a circulation movement to flow upwards in the two outer intermediate spaces (12) and then through the interior (13) of the insert (10) further downwards. A filter device (14) with a sieve (15) is provided for filtering the through-flowing frying fat. For contactless heating of the two side walls (8) of the container (1) from the outside infrared radiation is used.

A fryer
 
with a container (1) for the fat for frying into which a storage container (6) for the goods 

to be fried may be inserted from above,
 
as well as an insert (10) arranged in the container (1), which insert is open both at the 

top and at the bottom and which defines a respective intermediate space between its two 
side walls (11) and the opposite, heated side walls (8) of the container (1) in such a 

manner that in its circulating movement the frying fat streams upwardly in the two outer 
intermediate spaces (12) as well as thereafter streams downwardly again through the 

interior (13) of the insert (10), and a filtering device (14) with a sieve (15) is associated 
therewith for filtering the frying fat that flows through,
 
characterised in that,
 
the filtering device (14) is arranged within the insert (10) and consists of a plurality of 

sieves (15) arranged in the manner of baffle plates one behind the other in the direction 
of flow. 
A fryer according to claim 1
 
characterised in that,
 
the sieves (15) are formed as channels. 
A fryer according to claim 1
 
characterised in that,
 
the sieves (15) are formed planarly and in particular are inclined downwardly relative to 

the horizontal towards the side wall (8). 
A fryer according to any of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that,
 
the insert (10) with the filtering device (14) is insertable into and removable from the 

container (1) as a separate component. 
A fryer according to any of claims 1 to 4,
  
 

characterised in that,
 
in the region of the insert (10) the container is made V-shaped or U-shaped. 
A fryer according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that,
 
the container (1) has a rectangular or circular cross-section. 
A fryer according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that,
 
for the contactless heating of the two side walls (8) of the container (1) from the outside, 

infrared radiation is used which will be absorbed by the side walls (8) under the 
production of heat. 
A fryer according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that,
 
infrared lamps, heating tubes or gas burners are provided to produce the infrared 

radiation. 
A fryer according to claim 7 or 8,
 
characterised in that,
 
the outsides of the side walls (8) of the container (1) are blacked. 
A fryer according to any of claims 7 to 9,
 
characterised in that,
 
reflectors (17) are provided to reflect the emitted infrared radiation toward the side walls 

(8) of the container (1). 
A fryer according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that,
 
heating mats are provided for heating the two side walls (8) of the container (1).
