<ABSTRACT>
Starter drive sealing device for internal combustion engine especially including a starter pinion (10) with, in its central part, a bore (18) emerging on a front face (22) of the pinion (10) and in which a groove (20) is made having, on the front face side (22) a ridge (36) and a sealing plug (24), characterised in that the said plug, once fitted, has, bearing on the front face (22) a collar (28) joined on by a cylindrical part (34) with a flat bottom (26) the outer periphery of which has a swelling (38) interacting with the ridge (36) of the groove (20).

Sealing device for a starter drive for an 
internal combustion engine having notably a drive 

pinion (10) with, in its central part, a bore 
opening onto a front face (22) of the pinion (10) 

and in which is provided a groove (20) having, at 
the side nearest the front face (22), an edge (36) 

and a sealing plug (24), characterised in that the 
said sealing plug, once assembled, has, bearing 

against the front face (22), a collar (28) connected 
by means of a cylindrical part (34) to a flat base 

(26) whose external periphery has a projection (38) 
cooperating with the edge (36) of the groove (20). 
Sealing device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the diameter of the 

cylindrical part (34) of the plug (24) is 
substantially equal to the diameter of the bore (18) 

of the pinion (10). 
Sealing device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the distance (LG) separating 

the front face (22) of the pinion (10) from the edge 
(36) of the groove (20) is smaller than the distance 

(LB) separating the collar (28) of the plug (24) 
from its base (26) prior to assembly. 
Sealing device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the distances (LG) and (LB) 

comply with the equation LG = LB - (n x e), 
e
 
designating the thickness of the plug (24). 
Sealing device according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that 
n
 is between 0.5 and 2.  
 
Method for the use of a sealing device according 
to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 

that it comprises the following steps: 

a sealing plug (24) is fabricated by stamping, 
having a collar (28) connected by means of a 

cylindrical part (34) to a curved base (26) having 
a concave surface on the opening side; 
the plug (24) is introduced into a bore (18) in a 
pinion (10) so that its collar (28) is in abutment 

against the front face (22) of the said pinion; 
by introducing a punch into the cylindrical part 
(34) of the plug (24), the length of the said plug 

is extended and the curved base (26) straightened, 
which results in the formation, at the periphery of 

the said base (26), of a projection (38) which 
enters the groove (20); 
by withdrawing the punch, the projection (38) is 
pressed against the edge (36) of the groove (20). 
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the distance (LG) separating the front face 

(22) of the pinion (10) from the edge (36) of the 
groove (20) is smaller than the distance (LB) 

separating the collar (28) of the plug (24) from its 
base (26) prior to assembly. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the distances (LG) and (LB) comply with the 

equation LG = LB - (n x e), 
e
 designating the 
thickness of the plug (24). 
Method according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that 
n
 is between 0.5 and 2.
