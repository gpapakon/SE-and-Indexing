<ABSTRACT>
Two supporting handles, which are mounted with their limbs (6) on rotary pins on the side walls of the accumulator cover (1), are entirely integrated in the cover outline when in the not-in-use position. When pivoted up into the in-use position, steps (8), which are in the form of tabs and are formed in the limbs (6) enter grooves (9) in the cover, as a result of which the limbs are guided exactly.

<CLAIMS>
An accumulator having a housing of plastics material, 
whereof the casing is closed by means of a cover comprising one 

or a plurality of parts and which has carrying handles secured 
to the cover which, in the unused position, do not project above 

the outline of the cover, characterized in that two handles (2) 
are rotatably mounted on the cover (1), the pivot pin (3) 

integrally formed on the cover comprising a lower half-shell (4) 
and reinforcing ribs (5) completing the circle. 
An accumulator according to Claim 1, characterized in that, 
in covers comprising one part, both the half-shell and the 

reinforcing ribs of the cover pin are integrally formed on the 
side wall of the cover, and in that, in covers having a plurality 

of parts, which comprise a lower cover and a cover part standing 
away from the edge thereof, the reinforcing ribs are freestanding. 
An accumlator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the handles (2) have two limbs (6) whereof the ends are 

provided with a bore (7) which receives the pivot pin (3), and 
in that the limbs have a shoulder (8) above the bore, this 

shoulder being inserted in a groove (9) in the lid (1) when the 
handle is raised. 
An accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the reinforcing ribs (5) on the pivot pin 

(3) have on their upper side an undercut (10) for fixing the 
handles (2) on 
the pivot pin (3) in the unused position. 
An accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the bores (7) on the limbs (6) of the 

handles (2) are provided with oblique entry points (11) on the 
inside, which enable easier assembly.  

 
An accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the cover (1) has on its upper side, in the 

centre, a cavity (12) into which the outline of the handle is 
inserted. 
An accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the cover has a shoulder (13) on both 

longitudinal sides, by means of which the battery can be braced.
