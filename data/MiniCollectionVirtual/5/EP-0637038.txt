<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
core for a pulse transformer which is made of
nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloys, and a pulse
transformer for use in a digital signal transmission
system or the like.In the field of electronic circuits, pulse
electric technology such as digitization of electronic
computers, pulse communication and measuring devices has
been developed, and accordingly, there has been an
increasing demand for circuit elements which exhibit a
high performance in the wave-form transmission. A pulse
transformer for use in a system which transmits digital
signals in the form of pulses, e.g., an ISDN, is a wide-band
transformer which is mainly intended for the wave-form
transmission.A pulse transformer for "S"-Interface of an
ISDN must be designed and manufactured in such a manner
as to satisfy electric properties disclosed in, for
example, "Interface of INS Net Service", Vol. 2 (Layer
1, Layer 2), the third edition (hereinafter referred to
as Document 1) edited by the ISDN Developing Department
of NIPPON TELEGRAM AND TELEPHONE CORPORATION and
published by THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. In Document 1, an "INS Net 64" service and an
"INS Net 1500" service are described. Especially, in a
pulse transformer of the former, the primary winding
impedance at 10 kHz must be 1250 Ω or more, i.e., about
20 mH or more in terms of the inductance, according to
the specification of the electric properties disclosed
in pp. 37 - 55 of Document 1.Conventionally, pulse transformers are mainly
made of magnetic metallic material and ferrite material.
As a metallic material, Permalloy (Ni-Fe alloy) and
silicon steel (Fe-Si alloy) are employed. Since the
metallic material has an excellent low-frequency
property and a high saturated magnetic flux density, it
is used for a pulse transformer of a large pulse width
and a high application level. However, silicon steel
involves a problem that it has a low permeability, and
that a sufficient inductance can not be provided.
Further, Permalloy has an inferior frequency property
although the permeability at a low frequency is high, so
that it can not be suitably used for a pulse transformer
of a small pulse width. Also, because magnetic
properties of Permalloy deteriorate by an impact, and
because the price is high, using Permalloy for a pulse
transformer for interface of an ISDN or the like
involves a problem. On the other hand, the ferrite has
a lower saturated magnetic flux density than the
metallic material and it involves a problem when the
applied
