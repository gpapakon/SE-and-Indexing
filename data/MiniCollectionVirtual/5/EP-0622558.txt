<ABSTRACT>
A friction disc (110) includes a pair of segmented friction 
facings (112) adhered to the opposing sides of annular core (114). 

The friction facings (112) are composed of three arcuate segments 
(116) of sintered material or paper impregnated with a resin 

interjoined together at match lines (118) located generally 120° 
apart. Each arcuate segment (116) includes opposed ends having tab 

and slot configurations which are designed to have a pair of arcuate 
edge lines (124, 126), (124', 126') located in an opposed relationship 

proximate the annular centerline of the width of the segment (116). 
An interconnector edge line (128), (128') is located angularly across 

the annular centerline of the segment (116) and joined tangentially to 
the arcuate match lines (124, 126), (124', 126'). The remaining end 

of each arcuate match line (124, 126), (124', 126') is then joined to 
the respective inside annular edge (134) and outside annular edge 

(136) of each arcuate segment (116).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction discs for 
use in clutch or brake assemblies. Friction plate facings are conventionally 
bonded to metal plates or cores to form friction discs 
which are then incorporated into interleaved clutch 
packs. The clutch packs, generally, are interconnected 
with inner hubs and outer drums of a clutch assembly and 
are commonly engaged and disengaged through the use of a 
hydraulically or spring actuated piston. The typical 
friction disc used in such clutch packs commonly 
incorporates an annular steel ring or core and a pair of 
friction facings which are bonded to the opposed sides 
of the core. The friction facings are commonly blanked 
out as one piece rings from continuous rolls of friction 
material such as a sintered metal or paper impregnated 
with a resin which is fed through a blanking press. As 
the costs of such friction paper raw material increase 
and as industry becomes more accountable for its scrap 
and the need to properly dispose of the scrap, it has 
become a major objective to economize the amounts of 
friction paper utilized in manufacturing friction 
facings and, concomitantly, reduce the amount of scrap 
or offal remaining without compromising the strength or 
integrity of the end product friction ring. One of the first proposed solutions for 
achieving greater economy in the manufacture of friction 
facings is featured in US-A-4 260 047 (Nels) which 
generally discloses a friction disc for use in a clutch 
or brake assembly, comprising an annular core plate and 
at least one substantially annular friction facing 
adhered thereto, the friction facing being composed of a 
plurality of arcuate segments with means for securing 
the segments together to form the friction facing. More particularly, Nels provides four ninety  
 
degree arcuate segments stamped from a rectangular sheet 
of pregrooved friction material. The segments are 
interconnected by opposed tab and slot structures to 
form a complete annular friction facing which is then 
bonded on to an annular metal core. It has been discovered, however, that the 
match lines or junctions formed between the facing 
segments when the arcuate segmented facings are 
interjoined to create the annular ring create areas of 
structural weakness in the overall integrity of the 
friction facing. It has been particularly noticed that 
match lines or junctions which are disposed ninety 
degrees apart suffer from the greatest potential for 
premature failure. Further, the opposed tab/slot 
configurations
