having a hydrosilyl group and a hydrosilylation 

catalyst quickly adsorbs ethylene without 
forming hazardous substances and is thus 

suitable for keeping vegetables, fruits, and 
flowers fresh.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
refreshing agent, and more particularly to an 
agent for keeping vegetables, fruit and flowers 
fresh by removing ethylene generating therefrom. It is well known that vegetables, fruits 
and flowers can be kept fresh by removing 
ethylene generating therefrom. Known agents for 
removing ethylene include chlorites and 
hypochlorites as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (JP-A) Nos. 39243/1984 and 
198938/1988, respectively. These compounds, 
however, are unsuitable as agents for keeping 
vegetables, fruits and flowers fresh because 
they are not only slow in adsorbing ethylene, 
but also reactive to form hazardous chlorides. Document WO-A-90/10390 discloses a process for 
preservation of fresh fruits, vegtables and eggs. Therefore, an object of the present  
 
invention is to provide a novel and improved 
refreshing agent capable of adsorbing ethylene 
at a sufficiently high rate to keep vegetables, 
fruits and flowers fresh without forming 
hazardous substances such as chlorides. The inventors found that a composition 
comprising a compound having a hydrosilyl group 
and a hydrosilylation catalyst is a useful 
refreshing agent which can quickly remove 
ethylene given off from vegetables, fruits and 
flowers without forming hazardous substances. 
The refreshing agent is typically carried on a 
support. More specifically, a compound having a 
hydrosilyl group (â‰¡ Si - H) is susceptible to 
addition reaction with ethylene in the presence 
of a hydrosilylation catalyst such as platinum 
compounds as shown by the following reaction 
scheme. 
Because of an increased ethylene adsorption rate 
and addition reaction forming no hazardous 
substances, the agent is effective for keeping 
vegetables, fruits and flowers fresh.  
 
As mentioned above, the refreshing agent 
of the present invention is comprised of a 
compound having a hydrosilyl group and a 
hydrosilylation catalyst as essential 
components. The compounds having a hydrosilyl group 
include hydrogensilanes represented by the 
following formula (1) and organohydrogensiloxanes 
represented by the following formula 
(2). 
RnSiH4-n 
wherein R denotes a monovalent hydrocarbon group 
having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R' denotes hydrogen 
atom or a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1  
 
to 10 carbon atoms with the proviso that at 
least one of R's is hydrogen atom, n is an 
integer of 1 to 3, and m is an integer of 2 to 
1000. Examples of the monovalent hydrocarbon 
group are alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, aryl 
grou
