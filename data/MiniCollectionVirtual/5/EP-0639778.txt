<ABSTRACT>
Fault diagnosis of an HBT-based circuit using electroluminescence scans 
the circuit with a microscope coupled to a photodetector. The photodetector 

detects the light emitted by active elements of the circuit when powered and 
collected by the microscope. The light is converted into an electrical signal that 

may be displayed on an appropriate monitor for observation. The circuit may be 
powered with a steady source, a pulsing source or a gradually increasing source 

to detect which active elements are "on" or "off", which elements "latch up", 
and which elements "oscillate" contrary to expectations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diagnosis of integrated circuits, and more 
particularly to fault based diagnosis of HBT-based circuits using 
electroluminescence to determine the activity of active elements in the circuits. Typical diagnosis of integrated circuits is a time-consuming, manual 
operation. If the output of the integrated circuit is not correct, an engineer has 
to progressively cut circuitry within the integrated circuit to isolate the problem 
area through trial and error. In other words if the integrated circuit is a series 
of amplifiers, an engineer would work backwards from the output, progressively 
cutting out the amplifiers until the output from the current amplifier has a proper 
output. At that point the engineer can isolate the problem to the last stage of the 
integrated circuit that was cut out. A heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is one where the materials of 
the different portions of the transistor are different. Unlike silicon transistors 
where the base, emitter and collector are all silicon based, an HBT has, for 
example, an emitter of gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) and a base of 
gallium arsenide (GaAs). One problem with silicon-based transistors is that as 
electrons flow across the emitter-base junction, there is a reverse flow of holes 
across the same junction. HBTs however have a potential barrier across the 
emitter-base junction that suppresses hole injection, reducing the reverse flow of 
holes across the junction. The electron flow in a silicon transistor produces heat, 
since silicon is an indirect bandgap material. On the other hand HBTs are made 
of a direct bandgap material so that electrons, when energized into one state, 
return to the ground state in a single step, producing light energy. An article in Applied Physics Letters 45 (5), 1 September 1984, by J.R. 
Hayes et al entitled "Electroluminescence from a heterojunction bipolar  
 
transistor" indicates that electroluminescence has been observed from the base 
of a GaAlAs/GaAs HBT. The article presents the conclusion that lack of 
luminescence from the GaAlAs emitter confirms that the gradient across the 
emitter-base junction significantly enhances hole confinement. What is desired is a method of fault diagnosis of HBT-based circuits using 
electroluminescence to eliminate the prior trial and error manual cutting 
techniques. Accordingly the present invention provides a method of fault diagnosis of 
HBT-based circuits using electroluminescence that examines each active element 
of an HBT

<CLAIMS>
A method of fault diagnosis for an HBT-based circuit using 
electroluminescence comprising the steps of: 

   providing electrical power to the circuit; 
   observing active elements of the circuit with a microscope; 

   identifying which of the active elements are "on" by the light emitted; and 
   locating from the pattern of "on" active elements where faults in the 

circuit exist. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the observing step includes the 
steps of: 

   converting optical energy from the microscope into electrical energy using 
a photodetector; and 

   displaying the electrical energy as a video picture of the circuit on a 
monitor. 
The method as recited in claim 2 wherein the observing step further 
includes the step of scanning the surface of the circuit by moving the circuit and 

microscope relative to each other in a controlled manner. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the providing step comprises the 
step of pulsing the electrical power so that the "on" active elements pulse to 

make them more readily visible in ambient light. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the providing step comprises the 

step of gradually bringing up the electrical power to see whether active elements 
that should oscillate latch up in a steady "on" condition. 
An apparatus for fault diagnosis of an HBT-based circuit using 
electroluminescence comprising: 

   means for magnifying the surface of the circuit;
 

   means for scanning the surface of the circuit so that all of the surface 
passes under the magnifying means; and 

   means for observing optical energy picked up by the magnifying means 
from active elements of the circuit when the circuit is energized so that the 

condition of the active elements as being either "on" or "off" is readily 
determinable. 
The apparatus as recited in claim 6 wherein the magnifying means 
comprises a microscope focused on the surface of the circuit. 
The apparatus as recited in claim 7 wherein the scanning means comprises 
a movable jig upon which the circuit is mounted, the jig being movable in such 

a manner that all of the surface of the circuit passes beneath the microscope. 
The apparatus as recited in claim 7 wherein the observing means 
comprises: 

   means coupled to the microscope for converting the optical energy to 
electrical energy; and 

   means for displaying the electrical energy as a picture of the surface of the 
circuit.
