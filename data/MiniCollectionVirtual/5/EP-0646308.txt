<ABSTRACT>
A carrier tape (100) and cover strip (120) are provided for storing electronic components (170) and for supplying those components seriatim to a machine. The carrier tape includes a strip portion having spaced longitudinal edge surfaces (104, 106), and a plurality of pockets (112) formed in the strip portion. The cover strip is applied over the pockets to contain electronic components therein, and is bonded along two outer bonding portions to the edge surfaces of the carrier tape. In one embodiment, the cover strip includes a tear strip (128) attached to a medial portion (126) of the cover strip overlying the pockets, which may be used to separate the medial portion from the bonding portions to expose the contents of the pockets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carrier tape for 
storing electronic surface mount components and for 
supplying those components seriatim to a machine. The 
carrier tape includes a cover strip for covering the 
individual pockets of the carrier tape. In the field of electronic circuit assembly, 
electronic components are often carried from a supply of 
such components to a specific location on a circuit board 
for attachment thereto. The components may be of several 
different types, including surface mount components and 
through-hole components. Specifically, these components 
may include, but are not limited to such things as memory 
chips, resistors, connectors, dual in-line processors 
(DIPS), capacitors and gate arrays. These and other 
components are typically affixed to a circuit board that 
may later be incorporated into an electronic device. Rather than manually affixing each individual 
electronic component to a circuit board, the electronics 
industry makes extensive use of robotic placement 
machines, sometimes known as "pick-and-place" machines, 
which grasp a component at a specific location (the 
supply) and place it at another specific location (the 
circuit board). To ensure the sustained operation of such 
robotic placement machines, a continuous supply of 
electronic components must be furnished to the machine at 
a predetermined location in order that the robotic 
placement machine may be programmed to repeat a precise 
sequence of movements during every cycle. It is therefore 
important that each such component be located in the same 
position (i.e. the point at which the robotic placement 
machine grasps the component) as each preceding and 
succeeding component.  
 One way to provide a continuous supply of 
electronic components to a desired location is to load a 
series of such components into pockets that are spaced 
along a carrier tape. The loaded carrier tape, which is 
usually provided in roll form, may then be advanced toward 
the pick-up location at a predetermined rate as each 
succeeding component is removed from the tape by the 
robotic placement machine. Conventional carrier tapes 
generally comprise a self-supporting lower portion that 
carries the component, and a flexible cover strip that 
aids in preventing foreign matter from deleteriously 
affecting the component. The cover strip is typically 
bonded to the lower portion, and is progressively peeled 
away from the lower portion just before the robotic 
placement machine removes the component from the carrier 
tape.

<CLAIMS>
A unitary, flexible carrier tape (100) for 
storage and seriatim delivery of electronic components 

(170) by an advancement mechanism, the carrier tape 
comprising: 


(a) a top surface having first and second 
parallel longitudinal edge surfaces (104, 106), 

at least one of said edge surfaces including 
means (108, 110) for engaging the advancement 

mechanism; 
(b) a plurality of pockets (112) depending 
downwardly from said top surface between said 

edge surfaces and along the length of the 
carrier tape for containing the electronic 

components;
