<ABSTRACT>
A developer regulating member includes a thin 
plate having a spring property and a polyamide-containing 

rubber layer disposed on the thin plate. 
The polyamide-containing rubber layer contains a 

polyamide having the Shore D hardness between 25 and 65 
both inclusive. A developing apparatus includes a 

developer container for containing a monocomponent 
developer of negative charging property, a developer 

carrying member provided in an opening portion of the 
developer container, for carrying the developer, and a 

regulating member for forming a nip together with the 
developer carrying member and regulating a thickness of 

a developer layer on the developer carrying member. A 
surface of the regulating member forming the nip is 

comprised of a polyamide-containing rubber layer 
containing a polyamide havingthe Shore D hardness 

between 25 and 65 both inclusive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing
apparatus used in image forming apparatus such as
copiers and printers, and to a developer regulating
member for regulating a developer, used in the
developing apparatus.In the image forming apparatus of the
electrophotographic method the developing apparatus
visualizes an electrostatic latent image formed on an
image carrying member, in the form of a toner image.As one type of such developing apparatus, a
variety of dry-type monocomponent developing apparatus
were proposed and are under practical use. It is,
however, not easy to form a thin layer of toner as a
monocomponent developer on a developer carrying member
in either one of the developing apparatus.An improvement is demanded in resolution,
visibility, and the like of image nowadays, and it is
essential to develop a method and apparatus for forming
the thin layer of toner. Some measures were proposed
as to such method and apparatus.For example, as described in Japanese Laid-open
Patent Application No. 54-43038, there is a developing 
apparatus in which a rubber or metal elastic blade is
set in contact with a developing sleeve of the
developer carrying member and in which the toner is
regulated as being passed through the contact portion
between the elastic blade and the developing sleeve,
whereby the thin layer of toner is formed on the
developing sleeve and friction in the contact portion
causes sufficient triboelectricity on the toner.For regulating non-magnetic toner by the above
elastic blade, a separate toner supply member for
supplying the toner onto the developing sleeve becomes
necessary. The reason is that in the case of magnetic
toner the toner can be supplied onto the developing
sleeve by magnetism of a magnet in the developing
sleeve, whereas in the case of the non-magnetic toner
the toner cannot be supplied by magnetism.Thus, the developing apparatus shown in Fig. 4 was
proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
58-116559. In this conventional developing apparatus
proposed, an elastic roller 27 of fur brush structure
in contact with the developing sleeve 26 is disposed at
an upstream position in the rotating direction of the
developing sleeve 26 with respect to the elastic blade
25 in a developer container 24 containing the non-magnetic
toner 23 as a monocomponent developer, and the
elastic roller 27 scrapes the residual toner 23 
remaining on the developing sleeve 26 without being
consumed for development and also supplies new toner 23
onto the developing sleeve 26.The
