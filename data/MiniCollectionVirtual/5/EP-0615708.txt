<ABSTRACT>
A bumper and a luggage case incorporating the 
bumper are provided in which the bumper (6) comprises a 

body (18) moulded in a plastics material and having 
deformable projections (20) arranged on its surface 

which is exposed when the bumper is fitted to a luggage 
case. In a particular example, the projections are 

studs (20) arranged in an array and are of a material 
more deformable than the shell of the luggage case of 

the body of the bumper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bumper. In 
particular it relates to a bumper for use on luggage 
case, particularly a hard side suitcase. Such articles have previously been proposed. 
In US-A-4993526 a protective pad of resilient material 
has feet (24) for keeping a luggage case from a 
supporting surface, and in US-A-4163484 resilient 
strips are attached to a luggage case both to protect 
and to identify it. In a first aspect the invention provides a 
bumper for a luggage case which bumper comprises a body 
moulded in a plastics material, the body having 
deformable projections on that surface which is exposed 
when the bumper is in place on a luggage case. These 
projections serve to cushion the case and can be 
arranged to give the most effective cushioning effect. 
Preferably the projections are resiliently deformable. 
Typically, the luggage case will be a hard side case, 
for example, a hard side suitcase. Usually, the bumper will have means for 
attaching it to a luggage case, and these means may 
typically enable the bumper to be screwed onto the 
luggage case. Other conventional methods of  
 
attachment, for example using adhesive, may be used. In a preferred embodiment the deformable 
projections are studs which may be arranged in an 
ordered array, for example to give a pleasing 
appearance. An arrangement of the studs in rows is 
particularly preferred to provide a good cushioning 
effect. Alternatively, the projections may be ridges 
which may extend along the length of the bumper. Preferably the body of the bumper may be formed 
in a substantially hard plastics such as polypropylene, 
and the projections may be of a thermoplastic elastomer 
which is softer and more resistant to wear and tear 
than polypropylene. Generally the projections are formed of a 
softer material than the hardshell of a luggage case to 
which the bumper is to be attached, and/or are of 
softer material than the material of the body of the 
bumper itself. Preferably the projections project between 1 
and 20mm from the surface of the bumper. Most 
preferably they project about 2mm from the surface. The bumper with its projections prevents 
surface marks spoiling the appearance of the luggage, 
by absorbing the energy of knocks applied to the 
luggage case. Preferably the bumper has a portion which is  
 
oriented to lie on a first surface of a luggage case 
and a second portion oriented to lie on a second 
surface of a luggage case. The boundary between the 
two portions typically corresponds with a corner of
