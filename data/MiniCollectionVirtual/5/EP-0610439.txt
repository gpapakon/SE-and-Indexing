<DESCRIPTION>
The compounds described in this invention as well as their non-toxic salts and
pharmaceutical compositions containing them are useful for the treatment of
hypertension and congestive heart failure. These compounds are also useful as lipid
lowering agents.The renin-angiotensin system plays a well-defined role in cardiovascular
homeostasis [Ocain, T.D. et al. (1991) Drugs of the Future 16, 37-51].
Angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I by the enzyme renin. Angiotensin I is
then acted upon by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to form angiotensin II (A II).
A II possesses many crucial properties including vasoconstriction, aldosterone release,
and water retention and is implicated as the cause of high blood pressure in a number of
species including man. These hypertensive responses are the result of A II acting at
specific receptor sites. Compounds which are able to compete with A II for these
receptor sites but do not elicit agonistic receptor responses can be expected to counteract
(antagonize) the hypertensive effects of A II.E. E. Allen et al describe 4-oxo-quinazolines in EP 0411766 A.D. A. Roberts et al describe quinoline ethers in EP 0412848 A.D. J. Carini et al describe N-substituted benzimidaloles in US. patent
4,880,804 . P. Chakravarty et al disclose similar imidazole structures
in EP 0401030 A where the phenyl aromatic ring is replaced by a seven
membered heterocycle.E. E. Allen et al disclose N-substituted oxopyrimidines in EP 0419048 A.Similar structures are reported in EP 0424317A by P. Herold et al.The present invention differs from the above mentioned prior art in that it
discloses non-peptidic amino substituted nitrogenous 6 membered heterocycles fused to 
6-10 membered carbocyclic rings. The non-peptidic A II antagonists disclosed in the
above mentioned prior art are either oxo-quinazolines, quinoline ethers,
benzimidazoles,fused heterocyclic imidazoles or oxo-pyrimidines.The present invention describes the composition and utility of novel compounds
