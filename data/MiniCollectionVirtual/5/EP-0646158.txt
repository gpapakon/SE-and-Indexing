<ABSTRACT>
A gasket for a crown cap to be used on a carbonated beverage, especially a twist-off crown or for a bottle which is to be pasteurised, is formed of a thermoplastic material, which is preferably free of polyvinyl chloride, and which contains a hydrogenated copolymer of styrene and a conjugated diene, or a functionalised derivative thereof. The material is resistant to heat, and provides a gasket with advantageous sealing properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new composition for
forming a gasket in a crown cap, especially useful for
twist-off crown caps which are used to close filled bottles
which are subsequently to be pasteurised, as well as a
process for forming the gasket.A wide variety of processes and compositions have been
proposed for forming the gasket in crown caps. These
include introducing the gasket forming material into the
cap in the form of plastisol, a solution in organic
solvent, an aqueous dispersion (including aqueous latices)
and mouldable thermoplastic compositions. An early
disclosure of the use of thermoplastic compositions for
forming container closures is in GB-A-1,112,023 and GB-A-1,112,025.
Each of those specifications describe a wide
variety of introducing the compositions into the cap and a
wide variety of thermoplastic compositions that can be
used.Methods that are described in these two patents which
were known at that time include inserting and bonding a
preformed uniform disc into the cap, inserting and bonding
a preformed contoured disc into the cap, flowing a
composition into the cap while rotating it and optionally
moulding it, flowing a composition into the cap and
moulding it while the composition is still hot,
transferring a disc of composition from a carrier backing
onto a metal plate which is then formed into a closure,
transferring composition by a moulding die and moulding it
into the cap, compression moulding the composition into the
cap, and so on. In the new method described in detail in
'023, the composition was formed into a sheet, discs were
cut from it and the discs were then inserted into the
preheated caps and cold moulded into the caps. In many of
the examples the inserted disc had a diameter substantially
the same as the diameter of the cap. Thermoplastic compositions that were described include
blends of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and micro
crystalline wax, EVA and low density polyethylene (LDPE)
having a melt flow index (MFI) of 7, similar blends
containing also butyl rubber having Mooney viscosity of 70,
a blend of equal amounts of LDPE having MFI 7 with butyl
rubber having Mooney 70, blends of different types of EVA,
a blend of LDPE with polyisobutylene, a blend of EVA with
ethylene propylene copolymer, an ethylene acrylic acid
ester copolymer, a blend of this with LDPE, a blend of LDPE
with ethylene propylene copolymer, and a blend of LDPE with
chloro sulphonated polyethylene.Various disclosures of forming gaskets from
thermoplastic compositions have appeared

<CLAIMS>
A container of a carbonated beverage closed with a
crown cap having a gasket formed of a thermoplastic

material characterised in that the thermoplastic material
comprises:


a) 85 to 10% by weight of a rubbery polymer, which
consists of a hydrogenated copolymer of styrene and a

conjugated diene or a functionalised derivative thereof and
optionally other rubbery polymers selected from butyl

rubber, polybutadiene, styrene butadiene rubber,
carboxylated styrene butadiene rubber, polyisoprene,

styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, ethylene/propylene
rubber and styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, and
b) 15 to 90% by weight of other thermoplastic polymer
which is an olefin-based polymer selected from polymers and

copolymers of ethylene, polymers and copolymers of
propylene and polymers and copolymers of butylene,

   characterised further in that the hydrogenated
copolymer is present in an amount in the range 2 to 30%

based on the total weight of thermoplastic material.
A container according to claim 1 in which the crown
cap is formed from metal which is less than 0.25 mm thick.
A container according claim 1 or 2 in which the cap is
a twist-off crown.
A container according to any preceding claim in which
the hydrogenated copolymer is a block copolymer selected

from styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymers and
styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene copolymers.
A container according to any preceding claim in which
the thermoplastic material comprises 10 to 60% by weight of

butyl rubber.
A container according to any preceding claim in which
the olefin-based polymer is a polymer of ethylene, selected

from polyethylene, ethylene-propylene copolymers, ethylene-vinylalcohol
and ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers. 
A container according to any preceding claim in which
the gasket comprises an oil in an amount such that the

ratio of hydrogenated copolymer to oil is 1: at least 0.5.
A container according to claim 7 in which the said
ratio is in the range 1:1 to 1:5.
A container according to any preceding claim in which
the beverage is carbonated to at least 2.0 volumes.
A container according to any preceding claim in which
the beverage is beer.
A process in which a container is filled with a
carbonated beverage and is then closed using a crown cap

having a gasket formed of a thermoplastic material
characterised in that the thermoplastic material comprises

85 to 10% by weight of a rubbery polymer, which includes a
hydrogenated copolymer of styrene and a conjugated diene or

a functionalised derivative thereof and other optional rubbery
polymers selected from butyl rubber, polybutadiene, styrene

butadiene rubber, carboxylated styrene butadiene rubber,
polyisoprene, styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer,

ethylene/propylene rubber and styrene butadiene styrene
block copolymers, and 15 to 90% by weight of another thermoplastic

polymer which is an olefin-based polymer selected from
polymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene or butylene,

in which the hydrogenated copolymer is present in an amount
in the range 2 to 30% based on the total weight of

thermoplastic material.
A process according to claim 11 in which the crown cap
is as defined in claim 2 or claim 3 and/or the gasket is as

defined in any of claims 4 to 8.
A process according to claim 11 or 12 in which, after
the container has been closed, it is subjected to heat

treatment.
A process according to claim 13 in which the closed
container is pasteurised.
