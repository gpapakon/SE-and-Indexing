<ABSTRACT>
A method of evaluating a slurry mixing and placing 
process such as a cementing process, for an oil or gas well, 

comprises identifying subprocesses of a cementing process; 
expressing the identified subprocesses in a visual medium, 

including visually linking each subprocess to at least one 
other subprocess; performing identified subprocesses to 

implement an actual cementing process at an oil or gas well, 
including mixing a cement slurry, placing the cement slurry 

in the well and monitoring operating parameters of the 
performed subprocesses so that electrical signals 

representing the monitored parameters are generated; 
creating in a computer database in response to the generated 

electrical signals, wherein the database includes data from 
the actual cementing process related to the linked 

identified subprocesses; and analyzing data from the 
database for determining whether any identified subprocess 

as actually performed is causative of a problem in the 
actual cementing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of 
evaluating a process of mixing and placing a fluid for oil 
or gas wells, and more particularly (but not exclusively) to 
a method of evaluating a cementing process for oil or gas 
wells. During the creation of an oil or gas well, various 
mixtures are typically blended and pumped into the well. 
For example, a cement slurry of at least water and cement is 
mixed at the well and pumped into it such as for securing a 
casing or liner in the bore. As another example, a slurry 
of at least a base fluid and sand is mixed at the well and 
pumped into it as a fracturing fluid for hydraulically 
fracturing a subterranean formation and propping the created 
fractures open with the sand to facilitate oil or gas flow 
from the formation into the well. These, and other fluids 
such as acids, for example, are handled at well sites and 
placed in wells; however, only cement and the cementing 
process will be referred to throughout the remainder of this 
specification. Historically, the ability to quantitatively 
evaluate the quality of a cementing operation has been 
limited. When the designing, mixing and placing of cement 
slurry downhole has been evaluated, it has typically 
involved using qualitative or semiquantitative design 
parameters, rules of thumb, inherently variable material and 
variations of mixing equipment with virtually undocumented 
performance characteristics. Causes of failure occurring 
during placement have historically been almost impossible to 
definitively analyze. When cement has  
 
been successfully placed, operators have resorted to indirect 
acoustic methods to evaluate the expected performance of the 
cement sheath. The major evaluation method has, however, 
remained based on qualitative or semiquantitative wellbore 
performance acceptability criteria. Although cementing has 
been used for over 70 years in the oil and gas industry, the 
overall cementing process has not been critically analyzed in 
a manner whereby causes or modes of failure could be usefully 
evaluated in a concise manner or whereby both individual and 
overall cementing process quality could be assured or improved 
in a consistent and quantitatively defined manner. Aside from a basic desire to understand the cementing 
process more fully and to assure that a quality cementing process 
is being provided to customers, there is also the need 
for an improved method of evaluating and improving the 
cementing process for oil or gas wells due to national and 
international

A method of evaluating a cementing process for an

subprocesses includes selecting a mixing subprocess, a 

placing subprocess and a condition hole subprocess.

generating electrical signals in response to measuring 
actual cementing process conditions existing during the 

mixing and pumping of the cement slurry and corresponding to 
the defined measurable quality characteristics; 

transforming the electrical signals into data, including 
defining groups of raw data in response to the electrical 

signals and selected time markers applied thereto and
