<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an assembly (10) which serves for adjusting components of a motor vehicle between two end positions. The adjusting assembly (10) comprises an electric drive motor (12), the direction of rotation of which can be reversed, and a worm gearing (14) which is arranged downstream of the latter and the worm shaft (16) of which is arranged between two, as seen in the direction of the rotational axis of the shaft, mutually facing, spaced-apart shoulders (22, 24) and is provided with countershoulders assigned to the shoulders, one pair of shoulder and countershoulder (26, 28) being placed against each other by means of preloaded spring means (32, 34). In order to avoid undesirable sounds occurring as the direction of rotation is changed, the other pair of shoulder and countershoulder is also placed against each other by preloaded spring means, and the worm shaft can be moved, together with the shoulders placed against their countershoulders, in the direction of its rotational axis counter to the force of one or other of the spring means.
