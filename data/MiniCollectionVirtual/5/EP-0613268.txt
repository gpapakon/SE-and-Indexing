<ABSTRACT>
A clock recovery circuit (1) having a feedback system in a 
π/4 shift QPSK demodulator, comprising a signal state 

transition detector (12) for detecting state transitions 
between consecutive symbols of the demodulated baseband signal 

(DBS2) which is formed from the detected baseband signal (DBS1) 
by π/4 reverse shifting (5). According to degree of the 

detected symbol state transition, the 1/2-symbol delayed 
baseband signal is shifted by the amount of π/8 in phase. 

According to direction of the detected symbol state transition, 
the π/8 phase shifted baseband signal is converted into an error 

signal in use for the feedback system. An oscillator (16) 
generates a clock signal (SCLK) of a frequency controlled by the 

error signal such that the error signal is reduced in the 
feedback system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for recovering a
clock signal in a digital demodulator, and in particular, to a
clock recovery circuit in a QPSK (Quadriphase Phase Shift
Keying) demodulator for digital communication systems.In digital communications by means of satellites, QPSK is
generally used to modulate a carrier wave according to a digital
baseband signal. On the receive side, the baseband signal is
recovered from the received QPSK modulated carrier wave by a
QPSK demodulator. In such a QPSK demodulator, clock recovery is
a very important technology to obtain accurate symbol
identification. For this accurate clock recovery, various
circuits have been proposed.Figure 1 shows an example of a conventional clock recovery
circuit in a QPSK demodulator. Here, it is assumed that the
demodulated baseband signal D(n) corresponding to one of I
channel and Q channel is input to an input terminal A and the
QPSK demodulator operates at a sampling frequency N-times the
symbol rate (N = 2k; where k = 1, 2, ...). A signal polarity
change detector 21 detects the polarity change of the input
signal from the demodulated baseband signal D(n) and the output
D(n - N) of a one-symbol delay circuit 22 to make a selector 242
work. When there is a change in signal polarity, it is estimated
that the signal D(n - N/2) which is an output of a 1/2 symbol
delay circuit 23 had a near-zero value. Therefore, by using
this near-zero value as the amount of deviation from zero, a
Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) circuit for controlling the phase of the
sampling clock is formed, thereby implementing D(n - N/2) = 0
and allowing the output of a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator)
to be synchronized with the zero-cross point of the demodulated
baseband signal, that is, clock recovery is carried out.The operation of the signal polarity change detector 21 is
explained with reference to the flowchart in Figure 2. First,
in step S1, it determines whether there is a polarity change or
not. That is, the presence or absence of polarity change is
detected from D(n) and D(n - N). If there is a polarity change,
it means that there was a zero-cross point from one symbol prior
and on. Moreover, it can be estimated that the value of D(n - N/2)
is a near-zero value which can be taken as the amount of
deviation from zero. The relationship between the deviation
direction of the sampling timing of D(n - N/2) from the zero-cross
point and the polarity of D(n - N/2) depends on the
polarity change direction for the amount of one-symbol time.
Therefore, the
