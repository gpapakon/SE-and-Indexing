<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides DNA sequences encoding novel members of the TGF- beta  family of proteins. The TGF- beta  family comprises proteins which function as growth and/or differentiation factors and which are useful in medical applications. Accordingly, the invention also describes the isolation of the above-mentioned DNA sequences, the expression of the encoded proteins, the production of said proteins and pharmaceutical compositions containing said proteins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA sequences encoding novel
growth/differentiation factors of the TGF-β family. In
particular, it relates to novel DNA sequences encoding TGF-β-like
proteins, to the isolation of said DNA sequences, to
expression plasmids containing said DNA, to microorganisms
transformed by said expression plasmid, to the production of
said protein by culturing said transformant, and to pharmaceutical
compositions containing said protein. The TGF-β
family of growth factors comprising BMP, TGF, and Inhibin
related proteins (Roberts and Sporn, Handbook of Experimental
Pharmacology 95 (1990), 419-472) is of particular relevance
in a wide range of medical treatments and applications. These
factors are useful in processes relating to wound healing and
tissue repair. Furthermore, several members of the TGF-β
family are tissue inductive, especially osteo-inductive, and
consequently play a crucial role in inducing cartilage and
bone development.Wozney, Progress in Growth Factor Research 1 (1989), 267-280
and Vale et al., Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 95
(1990), 211-248 describe different growth factors such as
those relating to the BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins) and
the Inhibin group. The members of these groups share
significant structural similarity. The precursor of the
protein is composed of an aminoterminal signal sequence, a
propeptide and a carboxyterminal sequence of about 110
amino acids, which is subsequently cleaved from the precursor
and represents the mature protein. Furthermore, their members
are defined by virtue of amino acid sequence homology. The 
mature protein contains the most conserved sequences,
especially seven cystein residues which are conserved among
the family members. The TGF-β-like proteins are
multifunctional, hormonally active growth factors. They also
share related biological activities such as chemotactic
attraction of cells, promoting cell differentiation and their
tissue-inducing capacity, such as cartilage- and bone-inducing
capacity. U.S. Patent No. 5,013,649 discloses DNA
sequences encoding osteo-inductive proteins termed BMP-2
proteins (bone morphogenetic protein), and U.S. patent
applications serial nos. 179 101 and 179 197 disclose the BMP
proteins BMP-1 and BMP-3. Furthermore, many cell types are
able to synthesize TGF-β-like proteins and virtually all
cells possess TGF-β receptors.Taken together, these proteins show differences in their
structure, leading to considerable variation in their
detailed biological function. Furthermore, they
