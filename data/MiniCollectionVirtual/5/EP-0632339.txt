<ABSTRACT>
A developing unit (25), an image-transfer unit (27) and a
fixing unit (33,34) are located in that order in a vertically

long housing from the bottom to the top of the latter,
and a ventilation passage is laid, having an inlet

opening formed in the bottom part of the housing and the
outlet opening (38) formed in the top part of the housing and

extending by way of the developing unit (25), the image-transfer
unit (27) and the fixing unit (33,34). Air in the ventilation

passage is warmed up by extra heat from the fixing unit (33,34)
so as to induce an ascending air stream which expels NOx

and ozone generated by corona-discharge (27) and which cools
the fixing unit (33,34). With this arrangement, the necessity of

a ventilating fan can be eliminated so as to miniaturize
the electrophotographic printing apparatus and to reduce

the cost thereof while eliminating noise caused by a
ventilating fan. Optionally a fax unit is attached on top of the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic printing apparatus comprising, in the 
inside of its housing, developing means, image transfer 
means and thermally fixing means. These years, with the progress of the office 
automation for business equipment and machines, the 
demand of printers as terminal equipment of computers has 
been more and more increased. Inter alia, electrophotographic 
printing apparatuses such as laser printers 
which carry out nonimpact type printing have been rapidly 
spread in use because of low noise and a high printing 
quality. Heretofore, such electrophotographic printing 
apparatus use a ventilating fan for forced ventilation of 
air outside of its housing in order to protect the 
apparatus against gas such as ozone or NOx produced 
through corona discharge by a developing means and an 
image transfer means so as to ensure the printing 
quality, and in order to radiate remaining heat from a 
thermally fixing means.  Explanation will be hereinbelow made of a 
conventional electrophotographic printing apparatus. 
Referring to Fig. 4 which is a sectional view 
illustrating an essential part of the conventional 
electrophotographic printing apparatus, a photosensitive 
medium drum 1 is electrified through corona discharge by 
a charger 2, and is then formed thereon with an 
electrostatic latent image by exposure light from an 
exposure unit 3. Thereafter, the electrostatic latent 
image is developed into a visual image with the use of 
toner by a developing unit 4. The visualized toner image 
is transferred, by an image transfer unit 5, onto a 
printing sheet 6 which has been fed from a paper feed 
part (which is not shown) in synchronization with the 
rotation of the photosensitive medium drum 1. The printing sheet 6 on which the toner 
visualized image has been transferred is fed to a fixing 
part composed of a heating roller 7 and a pressing roller 
8, and after fixing of the toner visualized image, the 
sheet 6 is discharged from a paper discharge part 16. 
Meanwhile, toner remaining on the outer surface of the 
photosensitive medium drum 1 after the image-transfer is 
removed therefrom by means of a cleaning blade 9, and 
then the photosensitive image 1 is deelectrified by a 
discharger 10 so as to have a uniform surface potential. With the repetitions of the above-mentioned 
developing steps, several images are formed. The  
 
photosensitive medium drum 1, the charger 2, the image-transfer 
5, and the fixing part composed of the heating 
roller 7 and the
