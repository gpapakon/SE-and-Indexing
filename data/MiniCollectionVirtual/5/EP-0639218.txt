<ABSTRACT>
In a process for catalytically cracking a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock in a vertical riser reactor (120), the feedstock is mixed with hot regenerated cracking catalyst adjacent the base (12) of the reactor and, as the mixture flows up the riser (130), is thermally and catalytically cracked by the catalyst for at least 1 second and for at least the first 50 % of the length of the riser reactor (130) from the base (120). The mixture is then quenched in a quench zone (50) located within the first 90 % of the length of the riser reactor (130) from the base (120) by injection of a quench fluid in an amount sufficient to lower the temperature in the riser by at least 3  DEG C (5  DEG F).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
catalytically cracking hydrocarbon feedstocks.Processes for cracking hydrocarbon feeds with hot
regenerated fluidized catalytic particles are known
generically as "fluid catalytic cracking" (FCC).Distilled feeds such as gas oils are preferred
feeds for FCC. Such feeds contain few metal
contaminants and make less coke during cracking than
heavier feeds. However, the higher cost of distilled
feeds provides great incentive to use heavier feeds,
e.g., residual oils, in FCC. Resids generally contain
more metals, which poison the catalyst and an
abundance of coke precursors, asphaltenes and
polynuclear aromatics, which end up as coke on the
catalyst rather than as cracked product. Resids are
also hard to vaporize in FCC units. FCC operators are
well aware of the great difficulty of cracking resids
and of the profit potential, because these heavy feeds
are much cheaper than distilled feeds.Most FCC operators that crack resid simply blend
in a small amount of resid, on the order of 5 or 10 wt
%, with the distilled feed and add the blended feed to
the base of the riser. However, it is also known to
crack different kinds of feed at different elevations
in an FCC riser. For example, U.S. Patent 4,422,925
discloses an FCC process with a light feed fed to the
base of a riser, and a heavier feed, having a higher
tendency to form coke, charged higher up the riser.
Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,218,306 teaches cracking
gas oils in a lower part of a riser then cracking a
more difficult feed, such as a coker gas oil, in an
upper section of the riser.Blending feeds or splitting feeds, with a heavier
feed added higher up in the riser, are not completely
satisfactory when the feeds contain large amounts of 
resid or asphaltenes which are difficult to vaporize
quickly in the base of a riser reactor.Most units cracking resids adopt the blended feed
approach and try to improve the process by using
relatively large amounts of atomizing steam. Thus
while conventional FCC units, cracking wholly
distillable feeds, might add 1 or 2 wt % steam with
the heavy feed to improve atomization, those units
cracking heavier, more viscous feeds add significantly
more steam, 3, 4, or 5 wt % steam, or even more.
While increased atomization steam usually improves
cracking efficiency, it also substantially increases
the load on the main column, and limits primary feed
throughput. Steam reduces hydrocarbon partial
pressure, which is beneficial, but increases overall
pressure, which increases operating costs.

<CLAIMS>
A process for catalytically cracking a heavy
hydrocarbon feedstock by contacting the feedstock

in a vertical riser reactor with a source of hot,
regenerated cracking catalyst to produce

catalytically cracked vapors and spent cracking
catalyst, the cracked vapors being withdrawn and

the spent cracking catalyst being regenerated to
produce hot regenerated cracking catalyst which

is recycled to contact said heavy feed, wherein
the heavy hydrocarbon feedstock is mixed with the

hot regenerated cracking catalyst adjacent the
base of the reactor and, as the mixture flows up

the riser, is thermally and catalytically cracked
by the catalyst for at least 1 second and for at

least the first 50 % of the length of the riser
reactor from the base, and wherein the mixture is

then quenched after at least 1.5 seconds of vapour residence time in a quench zone located within the
first 90 % of the length of the riser reactor

from the base by injection of a quench fluid in
an amount sufficient to lower the temperature in

the riser at least 3°C (5°F).

hydrocarbon feedstock is mixed with the hot

regenerated cracking catalyst at a catalyst:feed
weight ratio of a least 4:1. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the quench fluid

catalytically cracked products, and mixtures

The process of claim 1 wherein said quench fluid
is steam or a vaporizable liquid added under

downstream direction relative to fluid flow in

discharge velocity of at least 30 m/sec (100

fps).
The process of claim 1 wherein the temperature at
