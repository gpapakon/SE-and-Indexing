<ABSTRACT>
An amylase inhibitor consisting essentially of a 
protein constructed of 248 amino acid residues having two 

subunits, each identified as SEQ ID NO:1, in which a single 
band is observed at a mobility of 0.26 by polyacrylamide gel 

electrophoresis. The amylase inhibitor is useful as an agent 
for inhibiting increase of blood glucose level, controlling 

insulin secretion or suppressing appetite, and as a food 
additive. For the same use, the amylase inhibitor is used in 

combination with a protein composed of two subunits, each 

identified as SEQ ID NO:2, the total content of both proteins 
being not less than 20% by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new amylase inhibitor
comprising specific proteins, a process for the preparation
of the same from a wheat origin material and the application
of such amylase inhibitor as a medicine or food.Intake of excessive nutrients induces secretion of
a larger amount of insulin to indirectly cause a collapse of
metabolic balance, thus leading to a reduction of glucose
tolerating function (hyperglycemia), diabetes, hyperlipemia,
arteriosclerosis, etc. Especially in diabetic patients, the
insulin function is insufficient and the glucose tolerance
is lowered. Consequently the blood glucose level is
remarkably increased after meals, thereby causing
complications such as damages in blood capillary and
arteriosclerosis. For the prevention and treatment of such
diseases it is said effective to ingest foods or materials
which can hardly induce an increase in blood glucose level.
In this respect materials capable of inhibiting or
preventing hydrolysis of starch into glucose have been
desired. Further, overeating contributes to diseases of
adult people such as adiposity, hypertension, diabetes and 
cardiac diseases.From the above aspects, various studies have been
made on so-called amylase inhibitors which are effective in
inhibiting the activity of amylase to hydrolyze starch. It
is reported that amylase inhibitors are also contained in
wheat. Since then, amylase inhibitors of wheat origin have
been investigated [see, for example, U.S. Patent 3,950,319,
Japanese Patent Kokai 61-171431, Phytochemistry, vol. 20,
No. 8, pp. 1781-1784, 1981; Eur. J. Biochem. 183, 37-40
(1989)].However, it is reported that prior amylase
inhibitors of wheat origin as mentioned above have an
exceedingly low or no inhibitory activity against human
pancreatic α-amylase, which do not produce an effect as
expected when orally given to humans, although they have
some inhibitory activity against amylases of other animals
than human. Therefore, there is a need for a highly active
amylase inhibitor having a strong inhibitory activity
against human pancreatic α-amylase and capable of
effectively inhibiting an increase in blood glucose level
and an insulin secretion when orally administered at a low
level, especially capable of effectively inhibiting
hydrolysis of heated or cooked starch.Further it is reported that an agent for
inhibiting an increase in blood glucose level or an insulin
secretion brings about an increased level of free fatty 
acids in blood [Puls and Keup, "Diabetologia" 9, 97-101
(1973)]. In general, such

amino acid sequence:

A process of preparing an amylase inhibitor
comprising predominantly a protein composed of two subunits,
