<ABSTRACT>
A process for the dyeing of cellulose-containing fibre materials with reactive dyes, which comprises carrying out dyeing in the presence of the salt of a mineral acid in an amount of 0 to 20 g per litre of dyebath and using at least one of the reactive dyes of formulae (I) and (II) in which the substituents are as defined in claim 1. This produces dyeings having good fastness properties in a high coloristic yield. Moreover, the addition of fairly large amounts of salts of a mineral acid, which is a common practice in dyeing, can be omitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the dyeing of cellulose-containing fibre 
materials with reactive dyes by the exhaust method. In view of the increasing demands on reactive dyeings with respect to economy, 
application technology and level of fastness properties, the level obtained is in many cases 
not fully satisfactory. Thus, it is still customary to carry out dyeing in the presence of 
fairly large amounts of salts of a mineral acid, which may lead to pollution of the waste 
water. In FR-A-2 511 017 there is disclosed a process for the dyeing of cellulose-containing 
fibre materials with reactive dyes by the exhaust method which process is carried 
out in the presence of 15 g salt of a mineral acid per liter of dyebath. Accordingly, the object of the present invention was to provide improved processes for the 
dyeing of cellulose-containing fibre materials with reactive dyes using, in particular, only 
small amounts of salts of a mineral acid. It has now been found that the process according 
to the invention fulfils the requirements mentioned. Accordingly, the invention relates to a process for the dyeing of cellulose-containing fibre 
materials with reactive dyes by the exhaust method, which comprises carrying out dyeing in the presence of the 
salt of a mineral acid in an amount of 0 to at most 20 g per litre of dyebath and using at least one 
of the reactive dyes of the formulae 
 
in which A1 and A2 are independently of one another, the radical of a monoazo, polyazo, metal complex azo, anthraquinone, 
phthalocyanine, formazan, azomethine, dioxazine, phenazine, stilbene, triphenylmethane, 
xanthene, thioxanthone, nitroaryl, naphthoquinone, pyrenequinone or 
perylenetetracarbimide dye, 
R1, R2, R3 and R4, independently of one another,  
 
are hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4alkyl, B is an aliphatic 
bridging member and Y1 and Y2, independently of one another, are fluorine or 
carboxypyridinium, 
and 
 
in which D is the radical of a diazo component, Q is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl 
or naphthyl radical or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic-heterocyclic radical and V1 
and V2, independently of one another, are a radical of the formula 
 
in which R5 and R6, independently of one another, are hydrogen, substituted or 
unsubstituted aryl or substituted or unsubstituted C1-C6alkyl, where alkyl, with the 
exception of methyl, may be interrupted by -O- or -NR'- and R' is hydrogen or
