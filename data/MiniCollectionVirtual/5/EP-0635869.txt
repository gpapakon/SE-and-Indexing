<ABSTRACT>
A wafer support apparatus used for electrostatic clamping of 
a wafer to the wafer support is disclosed, wherein a 

dielectric material, formed on the surface of a wafer support 
facing the wafer to facilitate the electrostatic clamping, 

has a protective coating formed over the dielectric material 
to provide protection to the dielectric material against 

chemical attack from chemicals used during the processing of 
the semiconductor wafer. In a preferred embodiment, the 

protective coating comprises an aluminum compound, such as an 
oxide of aluminum or aluminum nitride, having a thickness 

ranging from 1 µm to 30 µm, but not exceeding about 50% of 
the thickness of the dielectric material so as to not 

interfere with the electrostatic charge used for clamping the 
wafer to the wafer support. Also disclosed is a method for 

making the wafer support apparatus to protect the dielectric 
material on a wafer support, and use of same in a process for 

forming integrated circuit structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor processing apparatus, 
a method of making and use of same. In the processing of semiconductor wafers in a sealed chamber to form integrated 
circuit structures thereon, the semiconductor wafer is normally positioned on a wafer 
support within the chamber. To secure the wafer to the support, and in particular to 
prevent movement of the wafer (either vertically or laterally) during processing, it has 
been customary to physically clamp the wafer to the underlying support. More recently however, other means for securing the wafer to the support have been 
explored and adopted due to various problems, such as particle formation, mechanical 
stress, etch profiles, etc., which have been experienced with the use of mechanical 
force to secure the wafer to the support. One such wafer securement means, commonly referred to as electrostatic clamping, 
utilizes an electrostatic charge on the surface of a dielectric material formed over the 
portion of the metal wafer support facing the wafer, i.e., between the undersurface 
of the wafer and the facing surface of the underlying metal wafer support. Such 
electrostatic clamping is described, for example, in Abe U.S. Patent 4,384,918; Japan 
Patent Document 2-27748; and in "Electrostatic Force and Absorption Current of  
 
Alumina Electrostatic Chuck", published by Watanabe et al. in Jpn. Journal of 
Applied Physics, Vol. 31(1992) at pages 2145-2150. While this type of wafer securement, utilizing electrostatic clamping, has proved to 
be successful in eliminating the previous problems encountered in the mechanical 
clamping of the wafer to the wafer support, corrosion problems have been 
encountered because the dielectric materials which provide the most satisfactory 
performance in the use of electrostatic clamping to secure the wafer to the wafer 
support do not exhibit sufficient resistance to some of the chemicals used during the 
processing of the semiconductor wafer in the chamber. In particular, when a polyimide material is provided, as the dielectric material, on the 
top surface of the metal wafer support, it has been found that such polyimide material 
is susceptible to chemical attack by O₂ gas, used for in situ cleaning of the chamber 
after etching. The polyimide material has also been found to be subject to chemical 
attack by fluorine-containing gases as well, although to a lesser extent thin the 
vulnerability to O₂, attack. It therefore would be desirable to provide protection against chemical attack for the
