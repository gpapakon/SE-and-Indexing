<ABSTRACT>
Novel cyclic phosphorus(III) compounds and a process for their preparation are described. As bidentate ligands with metals, in particular metals of the 8th group of the Periodic Table, the phosphorus compounds form complex compounds which can be employed as constituents of catalyst systems.
