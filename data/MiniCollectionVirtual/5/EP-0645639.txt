<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus 
which can perform a test of a characteristic of a 

semiconductor device on a chip by itself readily in a 
short time and wherein a self test for each chip can be 

performed economically using a simple additional 
circuit. A testing circuit (20) is provided on a chip 

on which a large number of MOS transistors (Q₁ to Q₄) 
constituting a signal processing circuit (10) are 

provided. The testing circuit (20) includes a testing 
MOS transistor (Q
DDT
) having an equal size to that of at 
least one of the MOS transistors (Q₁ to Q₄) of the 

signal processing circuit (10) and a reference MOS 
transistor (Q
REF
) having a greater size than the testing 
MOS transistor (Q
DDT
). The drain current of the testing 
MOS transistor (Q
DDT
) and the drain current of the 
reference MOS transistor (Q
REF
) are compared with each 
other to check acceptability of a characteristic of the 

testing MOS transistor (Q
DDT
) which represents the MOS 
transistors (Q₁ to Q₄) constituting the signal  

 
processing circuit (10). The output of an output 

terminal (2) of the signal processing circuit (10) is 
controlled in response to a signal representative of a 

result of the test.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor
integrated circuit apparatus, and more particularly to a
semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus which
includes means for testing the performance of
semiconductor devices for each chip.In recent years, semiconductor integrated
circuit apparatus have exhibited remarkable progresses
in terms of integration, density and performance, and as
such progresses proceed, various problems in production
arise. One of such problems is an increase in
dispersion of a circuit performance arising from a
dispersion of a device characteristic upon production.
While particularly the operation speed is a circuit
performance for which the demand by customers is high,
the frequency of appearance of products which operate
but not at a satisfactory speed is increasing. Another
problem resides in that, while such dispersion of a 
circuit performance can be reduced by employing more
severe specifications for production of a wafer, even
with employment of such severe specifications, it
becomes more and more difficult for all chips on an
entire face of a semiconductor wafer to satisfy all of
the specifications in production. Consequently, it
becomes more and more necessary to try to change the
manner of control in production from the control in
units of a wafer, which has conventionally employed
popularly, to the control in units of a chip. In other
words, the requirement for testing for each individual
chip whether or not characteristics of devices remain
within the production specifications is increasing.One of semiconductor integrated circuit
apparatus which satisfy the requirement described above
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application
No. Heisei 2-140947 (Japanese Patent Application No.
Showa 63-295012). The circuit construction of the
semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus is shown in
FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 4, the semiconductor
integrated circuit apparatus includes a transistor Tr10
connected between an external terminal 010 and a
grounding line and making an object for testing, another
transistor Tr12 connected between another external 
terminal O11 and the gate electrode of the transistor
Tr10, and a further transistor Tr11 connected between
the gate electrode of the transistor Tr10 and the
grounding line. One of the transistor Tr12 and the
transistor Tr11 is turned on by "0" or "1" of a testing
signal TEST. When the transistor Tr12 is turned on, a
drain voltage (current) and a gate voltage is applied to
the transistor Tr10 from the external terminal O10 and
