<ABSTRACT>
An electrode system (40) intended for implantation in a 
heart is described. In one version, both the atrium and ventricle 

are electrically connected to a medical apparatus. 
The electrode system (40) is devised with an electrode lead 

(42) which at its distal end has an atrial electrode (44) 
which is affixed in implantation to the atrium before the 

electrode lead (42) is advanced deeper into the heart so a 
ventricular electrode (52, 56) is connectable in the ventricle 

of the heart. The electrode lead (42) has a first curvature 
(69) near the ventricular electrode (52) and a second 

curvature (71) near the atrial electrode (44) in order to 
facilitate implantation of the electrode system (40) and 

reduce mechanical loads on the heart after implantation. The 
electrode system (40) can also be equipped with defibrillation 

electrodes (60, 64) and/or physiological sensors, 
thereby becoming multifunctional.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode system,
intended to be implanted in a heart and connectable with a
proximal end to a medical apparatus for monitoring, diagnosing
and/or treating a heart, comprising an electrode
lead, an atrial electrode, arranged on the electrode lead,
for electrical connection to tissue in an atrium of the
heart, and a first electrode conductor, arranged in the
electrode lead, for connecting the atrial electrode to a
first contact at the proximal end.The present invention also relates to an electrode system,
which further comprises a ventricular electrode, arranged on
the electrode lead, for electrical connection to tissue in a
ventricle of the heart and a second electrode conductor,
arranged in the electrode lead, for connecting the ventricular
electrode to a second contact at the proximal end.The implantation of electrode systems in children is a problem
encountered with electrode systems of today. The electrode
lead between the medical apparatus and heart stretches
as the child grows and damages tissue in the patient's body.
To prevent this development, surplus electrode lead is sometimes
implanted in a loop around the medical apparatus to
serve as spare lead during the child's growth. However,
utilizing this spare lead effectively requires surgery to
introduce the necessary additional length of electrode lead
into the bloodstream towards the heart.Another problem with electrode systems is the need for a
plurality of electrode leads for different uses, e.g. when
both the ventricle and the atrium are to be stimulated or
sensed (as in DDD-systems), when the atrium is to be stimulated
and a physiological parameter is to be sensed.A large number of physiological parameters related to the 
heart's function is known. In addition to the electrical
signals from the heart, blood pressure, blood flow, oxygen
saturation, pH, blood temperature etc. are parameters of
interest. A plurality of these parameters can advantageously
be measured in the ventricle, so two electrode leads are
required when the atrium is to be stimulated and a physiological
parameter is to be sensed in the ventricle.Yet another problem occurs with electrode systems utilizing
defibrillation electrodes to be placed in the heart for
defibrillating the atrium, the ventricle or both. In particular
the atrial defibrillation electrode is difficult to
arrange in a steady position within the atrium.For heart stimulators in which both the atrium and ventricle
are to be stimulated and/or electrically sensed, a
