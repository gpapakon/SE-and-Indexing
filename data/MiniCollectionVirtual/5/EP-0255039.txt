<ABSTRACT>
A cavity floor comprises the underfloor (10), covered by a heat insulating layer (11), on which the upper floor (12) rests with supporting feet (13). Provided in the heat insulating layer (11) are channels (17), in which there are hot air ducts (18). The hot air fed in flows through the hot air duct (18) into a distributing space and from there into the cavity floor (16), which is arranged on a different level than the hot air ducts (18). The cross-section of the hot air ducts (18) is independent of the height of the supporting feet (13). The supporting feet (13) can be of a small height, thereby increasing the air velocity in the floor cavity (16) and improving heat transfer.

A floor panel heating comprising 

- a heat insulation layer (11) laid on an even lower 
floor (10), 
- an upper floor (12) laid on said heat insulating 
layer (11), resting on a plurality of support feet 

(13) to form a floor cavity (16) extending over the 
entire floor surface, 
- and at least one tubular hot air conduit (18) consisting 
of a hose or a pipe which is laid between the 

even lower floor (10) and the upper floor (12) and 
which has its outlet connected to the floor cavity 

(16), 
characterized in that 
said hot air conduit (18) is laid within a channel 
(17) of said heat insulation layer (11). 
The floor panel heating according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said hot air conduit (18) is covered 

with a cover (36) lying on said heat insulation 
layer (11). 
The floor panel heating according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the number of said support feet 

(13) is at least 30 per mÂ².  
 
The floor panel heating according to one of claims 
1 - 3, characterized in that said support feet (13) 

are provided with ridges. 
The floor panel heating according to one of claims 
1 - 4, characterized in that the outlet of said hot 

air conduit (18) opens to a distributor chamber (23) 
free of said heat insulation layer (11), which is connected 

to said floor cavity (16) and to an air passage 
(22) leading into the room to be heated, said air 

passage (22) having a regulating member for changing 
the quantity of air flowing into the room. 
The floor panel heating according to one of claims 
1 - 5, characterized in that said heat insulation 

layer (11) consists of triangular shaped bodies. 
The floor panel heating according to one of claims 
1 - 6, characterized in that said heat insulation 

layer (11) consists of shaped bodies (19) having air 
guiding members.
