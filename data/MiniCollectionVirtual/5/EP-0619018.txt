<ABSTRACT>
A new and improved polymeric membrane for use in biological assays is provided. A blotting assay employing 1,2-dioxetanes as a source of chemiluminescent employs, as an improved membrane, a polymer comprised of at least one monomer of formula (1). The membranes reduce background signal, improve sensitivity and reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to improved new membranes for use in
connection with biological assays performed on membranes,
specifically, chemiluminescent assays where the analyte is
deposited on a membrane, and subjected to subsequent processing,
the processing involving indicating the presence or absence and
quantity of a suspected element in the analyte by the release of
chemiluminescence. More specifically, this invention pertains to
improved membranes which can be used in connection with
chemiluminescent assays based on 1,2-dioxetanes which can be
triggered by enzymes and enzyme conjugates in ligand-binding pairs
to emit light.Increasingly, blotting assays employing chemiluminescent
detection have become a popular modality for the detection of
proteins and nucleic acids. Conventionally, such assays are
conducted by isolating a sample of the analyte on a membrane,
exposing that membrane to an antibody-agent or nucleic acid probe
agent complex, wherein the agent causes a composition to be added
to undergo chemiluminescence. In its most widely practiced form,
this type of blotting assay employs an enzyme or enzyme conjugate
as the agent causing a compound which can decompose to release
light to undergo that decomposition, thereby giving
chemiluminescence. Among the most popular compounds for this
purpose are 1,2-dioxetanes. These structures, if stabilized with
an adamantyl group or similar stabilizing group, or derivatized
adamantyl group, can be protected with an enzyme-labile group
which, when cleaved by a suitable enzyme attached to the antibody
or nucleic acid probe secured to the target compound of the 
analyte, forms an unstable anion, which then decomposes to release
light. In this case, using an enzyme, the chemiluminescent
compound is a substrate, and among dioxetane substrates, AMPPD
disodium 3-(4-methoxy-spiro[1,2-dioxetane-3,2'-tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]-4-yl)
phenyl phosphate is widely used.
Structurally related compounds, wherein the adamantyl group is
substituted with various electron-active groups, convert the
adamantyl moiety from a mere stabilizing agent to one which
actively influences dioxetane decomposition. Among these, the
chlorine-substituted compound, or CSPD, has been demonstrated to be
markedly effective. A wide variety of other compounds, bearing
other enzyme-labile protective groups, such as sugar, acetate and
other ether and ester moieties are known and effective.The protocol used in such blotting assays is conventional, and
among various blotting assays, Western Southern
