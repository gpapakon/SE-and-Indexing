<ABSTRACT>
A camera system includes a main camera body (10) having 
a main camera processor coupled to a main body operator 

interface (16), a recording head drive circuit (36) and wireless 
communication receiver, wherein the recording head 

drive circuit (36) is coupled to a recording head (38). A remote 
control unit (22) is also provided that includes a processor 

unit (48) coupled to an audio record/playback circuit (50), a 
remote operator interface (26) and a wireless communication 

transmitter (28), wherein the audio record circuit is 
coupled to a microphone. In operation, the processor 

unit of the remote control unit (22) controls the 
record/playback circuit (90) to record an audio segment of a 

selected duration based on control signals received 
from the operator interface. The processor unit (48) 

transmits sound ID data corresponding to the recorded 
audio segment to the main camera control processor via 

the wireless communication transmitter and receiver, 
and the main camera control processor (32) controls the 

operation of the recording head drive circuit to record 
the sound ID data on a recording strip located on a 

photographic film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to photographic 
still cameras including a sound or audio recording 
feature. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
photographic still camera having a remote audio 
recording unit that records sound associated with a 
still picture captured by the camera. Image information systems have recently been 
introduced in which photographic film images are 
scanned and stored in digital form on optical compact 
storage discs (CD's) for subsequent reproduction and 
display. The optical storage discs can be utilized to 
store audio information as well as image information. 
It is therefore desirable to provide a system in which 
audio information corresponding to the photographic 
film image is recorded when the photographic image is 
exposed, so that the photographic film image and the 
recorded audio information can subsequently be stored 
together on the storage disc. One approach to recording audio information 
related to a photographic image would be to provide a 
camera with a sound recording system that records the 
audio information on an audio storage medium. The 
sound storage medium could take the form of a magnetic 
tape, a magnetic information storage disc, or a 
semiconductor memory that can be detached from the 
camera and sent with a film roll to a processing 
facility. The processing facility would then develop 
the film image, scan the film image to create digitized 
image data, and store the digitized image data on the  
 
storage disc. The audio information contained on the 
sound storage medium corresponding to the film roll 
would also be recorded onto the storage disc. A common problem associated with the use of a 
separate medium is the requirement of correlating the 
recorded audio with the correct image during the 
process of recording the audio and image information on 
the CD. The invention is directed to providing a 
camera system that overcomes this correlation problem. The invention provides a camera system that 
includes a main camera body having a main camera 
processor coupled to a main body operator interface, a 
recording head drive circuit, and a wireless 
communication receiver, wherein the recording head 
drive circuit is coupled to a recording head. A remote 
control unit is also provided that includes a processor 
unit coupled to an audio record/playback circuit, a 
remote operator interface, and a wireless communication 
transmitter, wherein the audio record circuit is 
coupled to a microphone. In operation, the processor 
unit of
