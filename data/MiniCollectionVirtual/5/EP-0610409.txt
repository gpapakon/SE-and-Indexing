<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a measuring tube for an 
electromagnetic flowmeter, in which a metal tube is 
provided internally with an electrically insulating 
liner with a gap therebetween and said gap between the metal tube and the liner 
is filled with a filler material. DE-PS 11 21 347 describes an electromagentic 
flowmeter consisting of a measuring tube made of 
stainless steel with a ceramic tubing part, the latter 
acting as a liner. The ceramic tubing part is mounted 
at one end of the measuring tube and which is then 
closed with another tube of stainless steel, so that 
the complete flowmeter appears with the same inner 
diameter throughout. The outer diameter of the 
ceramic tubing is somewhat smaller than the gap in 
which it is mounted so that the medium to be measured 
surrounds the ceramic tubing. The above is not only a complicated method of 
assembly, but does also require specific 
characteristics of the material to be used in the 
flowmeter. The material that creates the necessary 
electric insulation to the electrodes in the flowmeter, 
in the present case the ceramic, has to consist of a 
solid material of a certain thickness. The material 
to be used in the measuring tube will be exposed to the 
medium to be measured and thus has to be resistant 
towards this. Finally, the flowmeter introduces a 
slight error of measurement because the medium flowing 
around the ceramic tubing is not accounted for in the 
measurement.  
 From US-PS 45 92 886 it is known that, when 
applying the liner by an injection-moulding process, an 
uninterruptedly consistent engagement between the liner 
and the metal tube is impossible to achieve on account 
of the different shrinkages of the metal tube and 
liner, and, at least in places, a gap remains. When 
the flowmeter is being operated, this gap gives rise to 
problems. Thus, the liner may become distorted under 
the pressure of the medium flowing through and in the 
course of time may be destroyed. In addition, fluid 
may diffuse right through the liner and fill the voids. 
Because the fluid expands as the temperature rises, 
however, on the other hand an inadmissible deformation 
of the liner can take place. The same problem also 
arises in the case of liners mounted by adhesion; when 
the adhesive, which has only a limited thermal 
stability, decomposes in places, such voids are formed. In the known case, a gap is left deliberately 
between the liner and the metal tube. A 
thermo-setting plastics material is injected into the 
gap so that inadmissible

A measuring tube for an electromagnetic flowmeter, in 
which a metal tube is provided internally with an electrically 

insulating liner with a gap therebetween and said gap between the metal tube and the

flowing and that the volume of the gap (17; 117) is enlarged by 
at least one recess (18; 118) in the internal circumferential 

face of the metal tube (2; 102), and the gap is sealed, whereby 
escape of any of said filler material from the space defined by said 

gap and said recess or recesses, is avoided.
