<ABSTRACT>
An audio data processing system (10) is described which comprises a 
control processor (12) coupled to an execution controller (22) through a bus 

(21). The control processor (12) serves as a master processor to control the 
operation of the execution controller (22) which in turn controls the operation 

of a multiplier accumulator (28). An ancillary data handler (20) is provided 
to retrieve ancillary data from an input FIFO buffer (18). Audio data is 

retrieved from the input FIFO buffer (18) by the control processor (12) and 
processed audio data is output through an output block (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of electronic systems and
more particularly to modular audio data processing architecture.The Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) has promulgated the
MPEG audio and video standards for compression and decompression
algorithms to be used in the digital transmission and receipt of audio and
video broadcasts in ISO-11172 (hereinafter the "MPEG Standard"). The
MPEG Standard provides for the efficient compression of data according to
an established psychoacoustic model to enable real time transmission,
decompression and broadcast of CD-quality sound and video images. The
MPEG Standard is useful in a variety of products including digital compact
cassette decoders and encoders, minidisc decoders and encoders, and other
decoders and encoders using the MPEG Standard. In addition, other audio
standards, such as the Dolby standard, involve the encoding and decoding of
audio and video data transmitted in digital format.The transmission of compressed digital data uses a data stream that
may be received and processed at rates up to 15 megabits per second or
higher. Prior systems that have been used to implement the MPEG
decompression operation and other digital compression and decompression
operations have required expensive digital signal processors and extensive
support memory. Other architectures have involved large amounts of
dedicated circuitry that are not easily adapted to new digital data
compression or decompression applications. Audio and video data
compression for digital transmission of information will soon be used in large 
scale transmission systems for television and radio broadcasts as well as for
encoding and playback of audio and video from such media as digital compact
cassette and minidisc.US-A-5,132,988 discloses an apparatus for processing a stream of data
that uses adaptive feedback to optimize equalizer coefficients. The
adaptive decision feedback equalizer apparatus processes information
stored on disc or tape media or the like and includes a data input
buffer, a gain acquisition circuit, a timing acquisition circuit, a
synchronizing circuit, an FIR filter, register means, feedforward
update logic for adjusting the equalizer coefficient signals to
develop undated coefficient signals, a dual ported RAM for storing a
plurality of the equalizer coefficient signals, feedback logic
responsive to the linear filter output signals, equalizer coefficient
signals obtained from the RAM and train data signals, and operative to
compute the equalizer error
