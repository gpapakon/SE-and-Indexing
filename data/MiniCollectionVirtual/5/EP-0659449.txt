<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of thickened water from water, silicic acid and additives, such as fatty acid esters or ethers of fatty alcohols and sugar alcohols of polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, or polyethyleneimine or polyvinylpyrrolidone, which comprises mixing     a) from 0.1 to 2 % by weight of silicic acid,   b) from 0.001 to 0.5 % by weight of additive, c) from 0.5 to 5 % by weight of starch and/or branched-chain polysaccharide, and d) water to 100 % by weight. ro

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing thickened water from
water, silica and additives selected from the group

consisting of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohol ethers
and sugar alcohol ethers of polyethylene glycol or

polypropylene glycol or polyethyleneimine or polyvinylpyrrolidone,
characterized in that


a) from 0.1 to 2% by weight of silica,
b) from 0.001 to 0.5% by weight of additive,
c) from 0.5 to 5% by weight of starch and/or branched
polysaccharide and
d) water to 100% by weight
are mixed.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the branched polysaccharide is guar and/or

carob meal and/or xanthan.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that substances which lower the freezing point

are added.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the substances which lower the freezing point

are selected from the group consisting of glycerol,
propylene glycol, potassium acetate, potassium lactate

and sodium chloride and mixtures thereof.
Process according to at least one of the
preceding Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that

preservatives are added. 
Process according to claim 5, characterized
in that the preservatives are selected from the group

consisting of sorbic acid, propionic acid and benzoic
acid and their derivatives and mixtures thereof.
Process according to at least one of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the individual components

a) to d), the preservative if used and the substance
which lowers the freezing point if used, are mixed in

any order.
Process according to at least one of Claims 1
to 7, characterized in that the starch is gelatinized

prior to mixing with the other components.
Process according to at least one of Claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the thickening action is

intensified by intensive stirring or action of shear or
pumping processes or by spraying processes.
Thickened water characterized in that it has
been obtained by one of the processes 1 to 9.
Use of the thickened water according to Claim
10 as fire extinguishing medium or fire protection

medium.
Use of the thickened water according to Claim
10, characterized in that it is used as carrier

substance for pigments, cleaning agents, crop protection
agents or drilling fluids, as contents of cooling

compresses or as ultrasound contact gel.
Use of the thickened water according to Claim
10, characterized in that the thickened water is used

as transfer medium for substances soluble in undensified
water, tannic acid or limescale removers by

dissolving the substance to be transferred in the
thickened water and applying the mixture prepared in

this way to the medium to be transferred, e.g. leather
or the surface on which limescale is deposited.
Use of the thickened water according to Claim
10, characterized in that it is used as stripping agent

for materials which have been fixed to solid substrates
by means of water-soluble adhesives by applying the

thickened water to the material.
