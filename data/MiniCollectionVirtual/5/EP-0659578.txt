<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dye-receiving 
elements used in thermal dye transfer, and more 
particularly to the use of certain polyoxyalkylene-modified 
dimethylsiloxane graft copolymers in the dye-receiving 
layer to prevent donor sticking. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to one of the cyan, magenta 
or yellow signals, and the process is then repeated for 
the other two colors. A color hard copy is thus 
obtained which corresponds to the original picture 
viewed on a screen. Further details of this process 
and an apparatus for carrying it out are contained in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,621,271. Dye receiving elements used in thermal dye 
transfer generally include a support (transparent or 
reflective) bearing on one side thereof a dye image-receiving 
layer, and optionally additional layers. The 
dye image-receiving layer conventionally comprises a  
 
polymeric material chosen from a wide assortment of 
compositions for its compatibility and receptivity for 
the dyes to be transferred from the dye donor element. 
Dye must migrate rapidly in the layer during the dye 
transfer step and become immobile and stable in the 
viewing environment. Care must be taken to provide a 
receiver layer which does not stick to the hot dye-donor 
element. An overcoat layer can be used to 
improve the performance of the receiver by specifically 
addressing these latter problems. In thermal dye transfer printing, only the 
dye in the dye layer of a dye-donor element is 
transferred to the dye image-receiving layer of a 
receiver element. Undesirable sticking can occur 
during this process between the dye-donor and dye-receiver 
elements. This defect is
