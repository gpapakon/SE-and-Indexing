<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to radio frequency receivers using a tuner with frequency synthesis. The subject of the invention is a method of programming a rewritable memory (14) associated with the setting of the tuner (10), consisting in remotely loading the said memory with data supplied by a centre having received a call via the telephone network (6) for the purpose of this remote loading. The data are matched to the site sending the call. The invention may be applied particularly to television receivers and to video recorders.

<CLAIMS>
Programming process for a frequency synthesis
radioelectric receiver containing a rewritable memory

that holds digital data designed to adjust the
frequency of the tuning means of the said receiver, the

said data being called up by choosing a broadcast
programme appearing in an ordered list known to the

operator, 
characterized in that
 the said data are
downloaded into the said memory (14) by using the

public telephone network (6) to make a call to, a
loading centre that retains sets of data appropriate to

programming the said rewritable memory for several
reception regions, the downloaded data set being

dependent on the indication of the telephone call's
region of origin provided by the operator of the

telephone network, a data set comprising, for its
region, the corresponding frequency allocation plan in

the form of digital data intended for the frequency
adjustment of the tuning means.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 it consists in coupling a telephone handset (7) of
a phone (5) used for the call to an infra-red remote

control box (3) associated with the said receiver (1).
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 it consists in making a bilateral
link between the said loading centre and the digital

control circuits of the said receiver.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the data transfer makes
use of an acoustic coupler and a modulator-demodulator.
