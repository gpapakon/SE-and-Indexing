<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic photosensitive member comprising a 
substrate and a light receiving layer composed of a non-single 
crystal silicon material containing a plurality of 
columnar structure regions therein which is disposed on 
said substrate, and a process for the production of said 
electrophotographic photosensitive member. As for the material by which the photoconductive 
layer of an electrophotographic photosensitive member is 
required to have a high sensitivity, high S/N ratio, 
absorption spectral characteristic matching the spectral 
characteristic of electromagnetic wave to be irradiated, 
rapid optical responsibility, and high dark resistance, to  
 
be excellent in mechanical durability, and to be not 
harmful to the human body at the time of use. The public attention has been focused on the use of 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon materials capable of 
satisfying the above requirements in electrophotographic 
photosensitive members. Electrophotographic photosensitive 
members having a photoconductive layer formed of such 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon material are disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 
86341/1979. And various electrophotographic photosensitive 
members having an amorphous silicon photoconductive layer 
have been frequently used. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 
62254/1981 and 119356/1982 disclose the use of hydrogenated 
amorphous silicon materials containing carbon atoms in 
electrophotographic photosensitive members in order to 
improve their electrophotographic characteristics. Incidentally, the formation of a film of such 
amorphous silicon material as above described as a 
constituent of the electrophotographic photosensitive 
member can be conducted by the sputtering process, film-forming 
manner by decomposing raw material gas with the 
action of thermal energy (that is, the so-called thermal-induced 
CVD process), film-forming manner by decomposing 
raw material gas with the action of light energy (that is,  
 
the so-called light-induced CVD process), or film-forming 
manner by decomposing raw material gas with the action of 
plasma (that is, the so-called plasma CVD process). Of 
these film-forming processes, the plasma CVD process has 
been frequently used. And there are known various apparatus 
suitable for practicing the plasma CVD process. As the plasma CVD process, there is known the so-called 
microwave plasma CVD process based on microwave glow 
discharge decomposition. The
