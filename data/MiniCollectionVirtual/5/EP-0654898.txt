<ABSTRACT>
In the transmission circuit, part of the 
output signal of the transmission circuit is derived by 

an output monitor circuit (12), and, after being 
subjected to envelope detection by an output detector 

circuit (13), the output signal of the output detector 
circuit is inputted to a peak hold circuit (14) 

successively holding the peaks of the input signal, so 
that varying amplitude components are removed, and a DC 

value is detected. An error detector circuit (15) 
compares the detected value with a reference signal 

generated from a reference signal generator circuit 
(16), and the error signal is used as a gain control 

signal to control the gain of a power amplifier circuit 
(11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transmission
circuit for use in a radio transmitter, such as, that
used in the field of mobile radio communication.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the
structure of a prior art transmission circuit known from, e.g. EP-A-0 524 008. Referring
to Fig. 1, the prior art transmission circuit
includes a power amplifier circuit 1, an output monitor
circuit 2, an output detector circuit 3, an error
detector circuit 4, a reference signal generator circuit
5, a high-frequency signal input terminal 6, a gain
control terminal 7 and a transmission output terminal 8.The operation of the prior art transmission
circuit having the above structure will now be
described. A high-frequency signal inputted through the
high-frequency signal input terminal 6 is amplified by
the power amplifier circuit 1, and, after being then
branched by the output monitor circuit 2, part of the
amplified high-frequency signal is outputted from the
transmission output terminal 8. The remaining part of
the amplified high-frequency signal is inputted to the
output detector circuit 3, and the output signal VDET of
the output detector circuit 3 is inputted to the error 
detector circuit 4. In the error detector circuit 4,
the detected voltage signal VDET is compared with a
reference signal VREF generated from the reference signal
generator circuit 5 to detect the error voltage, and the
detected error voltage signal is then inputted to the
power amplifier circuit 1 through the gain control
terminal 7 so as to control the gain of the power
amplifier circuit 1.However, in the case where the high-frequency
signal inputted through the high-frequency input
terminal 6 of the transmission circuit having the
structure as described above is a linear modulated
signal whose amplitude carries some kind of information,
this manner of loop control will cancel the modulation
when the reference signal VREF is a constant voltage.
Thus, the prior art transmission circuit has had the
problem that its output waveform tends to be distorted. JP-A-56066916 discloses an automatic gain control circuit
for a burst signal. To this end, a burst shape output signal
is detected at an envelope detector and inputted to a broad
band amplifier. The broad band amplifier includes a peaking
circuit to obtain higher gain at higher frequency. Thus, by
setting the amplitude frequency characteristics so that the
gain of the frequency component with shorter burst time can be
increased, the hold voltage of a capacitor can be kept
constant, so that the peak hold
