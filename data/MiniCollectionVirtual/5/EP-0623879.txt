<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a microprocessor (10) which - among other things - includes a ROM memory (15), a RAM memory (18), a NVPM (non-volatile and programmable) memory (20) and an electronic decoder circuit (21) which allows control of memory access. More precisely, the present invention relates to a microprocessor which guarantees the integrity, inviolability and confidentiality of private data emanating from a multi-application environment managed by the said microprocessor.

<CLAIMS>
A microprocessor (10) comprising:

a ROM (15) in which an operating system (COS) resides;
a RAM (18);
a programmable non-volatile memory (PNVM) (20) containing a
service program; and
an instruction to be executed,

characterized in that said microprocessor (10) is provided with an
electronic decoder circuit (21) which determines the nature of the memory

containing said instruction to be executed and, in the event of said instruction
being an instruction of a service-supplier's program, said microprocessor (10)

proceeds via a diversion to a vector situated in the ROM (15), the subprogram
served by said vector verifying that the address specified in the instruction

belongs to a memory domain of the service-supplier's program.
A microprocessor (10) according to claim 1, characterized in that the
decoder circuit (21) decodes microcode indexed by an opcode contained in a

program memory as a function of the nature of the memory.
A microprocessor (10) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
instruction is a memory addressing instruction and in that the diversion via the

vector situated in the ROM (15) takes place systematically.
