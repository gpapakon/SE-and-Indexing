<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical amplifier and an optical
communications network comprising said optical amplifier, and to compounds suitable for use in said amplifier.Optical communication, such as in particular telecommunication by means
of optical glass fibres has become very well known. When an optical signal is
transmitted through an optical fibre, losses occur which cause the signal to be
weakened. In order to compensate for this weakening of the signal, the optical fibre or
optical cable has to be provided with regularly spaced amplifiers. Such an amplifier can
be based on a system in which first the optical signal is converted into an electrical
signal by means of, for example, a photodiode, after which said signal is amplified and
then converted again into an amplified optical signal, for example, by means of a laser.In the past five years, the trend has been towards directly amplifying an
optical signal by means of a so-called optical amplifier without using an intermediate
electrical amplifier.The invention more particularly relates to an optical amplifier for a weak
optical signal, said amplifier comprising an optical amplification medium which is
provided with a rare earth ion, first optical means for sending the optical signal through
the amplification medium, a laser pump for exciting the rare earth ion, second optical
means for sending the pump signal originating from the laser pump through the
amplification medium, and third optical means for passing on the amplified optical
signal originating from the amplification medium.Such an amplifier is for example known from Optical and Quantum
Electronics 24 (1992), pp. 517-538.The amplification medium of the known optical amplifier is a glass fibre
which, as usual, comprises a core and a cladding of glass, a rare earth ion, notably
Er3+, being dissolved in said core. Such a glass fibre is also referred to as optical fibre.A disadvantage of the known optical amplifier is that the concentration of
the rare earth ion, such as Er3+, in the core glass of the glass fibre is very small
because otherwise so-called concentration quenching would occur. This implies that in 
order to attain a reasonable degree of amplification a great length of the glass fibre
amplification medium is required. For example, in Electronic Letters, Vol. 25, No. 24,
pp. 1656-1657 (Nov. 1989) an Er3+-doped glass fibre having a length of 100 m is
mentioned. The concentration was 100 ppm Er3+. In this manner a gain in excess of 40
dB was attained.When splitting optical
