A cholesterol level depressant containing a non-cross-linking anion exchange resin having a structural unit represented by 
general formula (I) as the main ingredient, wherein R₁ represents benzyl or C₁-C₂₀ alkyl; R₂ and R₃ may be the same or different 

from each other and each represents C₁-C₄ alkyl; R₄ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; X represents a physiologically 
acceptable counter ion; n is 1 to 3; and p represents an average degree of polymerization of 10 to 10,000.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cholesterol-lowering
drug containing an anion exchange resin by
which a blood cholesterol level can be remarkably
lowered.It has been known that lowering a blood
cholesterol level is effective in preventing
atherosclerosis. In particular, the investigation
conducted by U.S. Lipid Research Clinics Program has
clarified that a decrease in blood cholesterol level
correlates to the suppression of the incidence of
cardiac coronary arterial diseases and that anion
exchange resins are effective in preventing these
diseases. Anion exchange resins which are publicly
known to have been used as a cholesterol-lowering drug
for lowering a blood cholesterol level, are for
example cholestyramine which is a polymer of
styrylmethyitrimethylammonium chloride, and a
composition containing styrylmethyltrimethylammonium
chloride (see U.S. Patents Nos. 3,499,960 and
3,780,171 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No.
10386/78). Further, a copolymer of imidazole with
halomethyloxysilane, having a higher efficacy than
cholestyramine, has been reported as another example 
(see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. 124819/90).
Furthermore, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No.
212505/90 disclose an acrylic polymer containing a
quaternarized alkylammonium and a composition
comprising the polymer as still other examples.
However, the exchange capacity (from 1.98 to 3.66 meq
Cl-/g) disclosed in this Gazette cannot be thought to
be sufficiently large as compared with that of
cholestyramine (2.9 meq Cl-/g; see U.S. Patent No.
3,780,171). The compound disclosed in the Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. 212505/90 cited above
involves a crosslinking unit as an essential
constituent factor. Accordingly, this Gazette has
neither disclosed nor suggested that non-crosslinked
acrylic polymers disclosed in the present invention
have an effect of lowering a cholesterol level.It is believed that these anion exchange
resins adsorb and fix bile acids thereto and thus
promote the catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids
to thereby lower a blood cholesterol level as will be
discussed in greater detail hereinafter.Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol
serving as a precursor thereof in the liver, secreted
from the common bile duct into the intestinal tract,
absorbed together with fat-soluble substances and then
recovered into the liver, thus circulating through the
bowels and the liver. Therefore, bile acids are 
present in a fixed amount in the cycle called the
enterohepatic circulation without their systemic
cir
