<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing the strength and of reducing strength variations 
of multi-layer wood, plywood or similar by measuring 

the density of the veneer sheets used in the production and by 
grading the veneer sheets accordingly. The density of the veneer 

sheets is measured in a manner known 
per se
 by using a high-frequency 
electromagnetic resonator (2). To build up layers of multi-layer 

wood, plywood or similar (12), veneer sheets confirmed 
to have a higher density are graded as surface sheets (13) 

and/or local density variations of central sheets (14) are reduced 
by mixing veneer sheets with various densities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of enhancing the strength and reducing the
strength variation of multi-layer wood, plywood or similar in which the density
of the veneer sheets used for their production is measured with a high-frequency
electromagnetic resonator and the veneer sheets are sorted accordingly.It has fairly long been known that the strength of wood
increases as a function of the density if the wood structure remains
unchanged, i.e. the knot structure does not change substantially.
In most wood implementations, it would be vital to
know the wood density, since these data would allow users to select
a strong wood type for sites and purposes where such
strength is particularly required, and weaker types for less
important or requiring purposes. The strength of wood varies
considerably. There are several search results about the correlation
between wood density and strength, among which we cite:
Kollman, F.F.P., Wilfred, A.C.Jr.: Principles of Wood Science
and Technology I Solid Wood, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg,
1968. A rough estimate is that the strength of wood is approximately
a linear function of its density, the correlation being
equal to the general formula s = a Â· db, where s is the strength
(MPa), a is constant, d is the relative density and b is constant
with an approximate value of 1.03. Thus, the weight of veneer
sheets used for the manufacture of multi-layer wood sheets,
plywood or similar varies from 2.8 to 5.6 kg/sheet, the sheet
size being 1.6 m/1.93 m and the thickness 3.2 mm. The sheet density
varies accordingly and so does the strength, clearly indicating
significant strength variations.It is previously known to grade veneer sheets according to density
by measuring the weight of each veneer sheet with express
scales and grading the sheets accordingly. This is possible because
the veneer sheet has specific dimensions in view of the
lathe setting and the cutters. Using weighing as a measuring
method slows down manufacture on the production line markedly,
and is therefore not frequently used. It has the additional 
drawback that only the average density of the veneer sheet can
be determined, whereas it may be crucial for the use of the
sheet to detect for instance individual weak points with lower
density, although the average strength of the sheet would be
satisfactory. In addition, this weighing method involves errors
due to moisture variations, given that weighing does not distinguish
the reason for the weight, i.e. whether a great weight is
due to the dry substance

<CLAIMS>
A method for enhancing the strength and reducing the strength variation of multi-layer
wood, plywood or similar (12) in which the density of the veneer sheets (10)

used for their production is measured with a high-frequency electromagnetic resonator
(2) and the veneer sheets (10) are sorted accordingly, 
characterised in that
 the dry
substance density of the veneer sheets is measured and that when building up the

layers of the multi-layer wood, plywood or similar (12), sheets with a high dry
substance density are graded as surface sheets (13) and/or the local dry substance

density variation of the central sheets (14) is reduced by mixing veneer sheets with
different dry substance densities.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the said resonator (2) is a
quasi-TEM transmission line resonator, comprising advantageously ground planes (6)

and central conductors (8) on either side of the sheet (10) to be checked, and 
in that
 the
resonator is formed in a manner known 
per se
 with p-i-n diodes into several sensor
units (9) which are distributed over the width of the veneer sheet and are controlled

and operated separately in order to measure the transverse dry substance density
distribution of the veneer sheets while eliminating the moisture content.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the dry substance
density of the veneer sheet(s) (10) is measured at several points over its length,

advantageously while the veneer sheets are moving through the resonator (2), in order
to measure the longitudinal dry substance density distribution of the veneer sheets.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the central veneer sheets
(14) are arranged on the basis of the dry substance densities measured in the veneer

sheets (10), so that the moving average of the dry substance densities of the veneer
sheets taken (D3) to the said layer assembly remains as close as possible to the overall

average of the veneer sheets used as central sheets.
A method according to claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
row of veneer sheets (10) taken to the layer assembly is formed

into a buffer stock, or veneer sheets deviating substantially

from the average are taken from this row to the buffer stock,
and 
in that
 the moving average of the dry substance density of
the group of veneer sheets placed substantially on top of each

other in the assembly is set close to the overall average of the
dry substance density of the veneer sheets by altering the order

of veneer sheets and/or by removing and/or inserting veneer
sheets.
A method according to claim 1 or 4, 
characterized in that
 the
row of veneer sheets (10) taken to the assembly is formed into

at least two and preferably into three veneer sheet piles (A, B,
C) acting as buffer stocks for at least the central veneer

sheets (14), and 
in that
 the arriving veneer sheet (10) of which
the density has been measured is transferred (D2) to the respective

veneer sheet pile in which it converts the moving average
of the dry substance densities of the sheets in the pile into a

value closer to the common average of all the piles moving accordingly.
A method according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the average
of the respective veneer sheets in the piles is used as

moving average of the dry substance density and 
in that
 the veneer
sheets are taken to the piles (A, B, C) from above, and are

withdrawn from the pile from below in a respective number equalling
the number of veneer sheets used on top of each other in

the multi-layer wood or plywood or similar.
A method according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the
moving average of the dry substance density is approximately

calculated in each pile (A, B, C) for a group corresponding to
the number of veneer sheets placed on top of each other in the

multi-layer wood, plywood or similar and/or for a greater number
of veneer sheets with appropriate weight coefficients.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 veneer sheets (R) having a particularly low dry 
substance density according to the measurement of the density of

the veneer sheets (10) are removed from among the veneer sheets
taken to high quality assembly.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized

 products of various qualities are produced on the
basis of the measurement of the dry substance density and the

grading of the veneer sheets.
