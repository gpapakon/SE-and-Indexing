<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at improving the soft contact lens wearing condition, the productivity thereof and the optical effect 
thereof. In a soft contact lens consisting of an inner surface (10), an outer surface (12) and an inner and outer surface-connecting 

surface (14), the inner surface (10) is composed of a central portion (16) of an elliptic surface portion having an eccentricity in the 
range of 0.2-0.7 and an apex radius of curvature of 5.00-10.00 mm, an intermediate portion (18) of an elliptic surface portion positioned 

around the central portion (16), having an eccentricity in the range of 0.2-0.7 and different from the central portion (16) 
in at least one of the eccentricity and apex radius of curvature, and a peripheral portion (20) positioned around the intermediate 

portion (18) and separating gradually away from a cornea as the peripheral portion is away from the intermediate portion in the 
radially outward direction, so as to gradua
lly increase the distance between the peripheral portion and the cornea, these three portions 
being continuously connected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a soft
contact lens, and more particularly to an improvement in the
configuration of a back surface of the soft contact lens,
the back surface serving as a cornea-contacting surface
which contacts a cornea of a human eye.The configuration of a contact lens should be
determined so as to satisfy the following three major
requirements A through C, for assuring a contact lens wearer
of comfortable wearing conditions of the lens, i.e., good
adaptability and compatibility properties of the lens. The
three major requirements are as follows.
A: The back surface of the contact lens is formed in a
concave shape, so that the back surface of the lens
may suitably fit the shape (convex) of the cornea of
the lens wearer.B: The configuration of the peripheral portion of the
lens permits good circulation of the tear fluid
existing between the cornea and the back surface of the
lens. C: The lens as a whole has a smooth surface and a small
wall thickness, to thereby decrease discomfort as felt
by the contact lens wearer when he blinks.It is known that the surface of the human cornea
is not a truly spherical surface, but an aspherical surface
whose curvature generally increases from its center toward
its periphery. In view of this fact, various attempts have
been made to adapt the configuration of the back surface of
the contact lens so as to satisfy the above-mentioned
requirement A.More specifically described, a contact lens having
an ellipsoidal back surface has been proposed since the
configuration of the cornea of the human eye approximates an
ellipsoidal surface. For example, Publication No. 49-18266
of examined Japanese Patent Application discloses a hard
contact lens whose entire back surface is formed by a single
ellipsoidal surface. Although the disclosed contact lens
permits better wearing conditions as compared with a contact
lens whose back surface is made spherical, the contact lens
does not necessarily satisfy the requirement A as indicated
above, that is, the back surface of the contact lens does
not closely fit the cornea, because of its single
ellipsoidal back surface configuration.Described in detail, the curvature of the cornea
changes such that the radius of curvature of the cornea
increases from its center toward its periphery as stated
above, but the rate of change in the curvature is not 
constant. If the entire back surface of the contact lens is
formed by adopting an eccentricity which is determined based
on the rate of change in the curvature at the

A soft contact lens having a back surface (10)
which is to face a cornea, a front surface (12) which

cooperates with said back surface so as to provide a
desired degree of dioptric power of the lens, and a

connecting surface (14) for continuously connecting said
back and front surfaces of said lens to each other,

wherein:-

said back surface is constituted by a central
portion (16) which is to contact said cornea and serves

as an optical lens portion, said central portion being
formed by an ellipsoidal surface with an eccentricity in

the range of 0.2-0.7, and a vertex radius of curvature in
the range of 5.00-10.00 mm; and
an intermediate portion (18) which is to
contact said cornea and is located at the periphery of

said central portion so as to surround said central
portion, is formed by

another ellipsoidal surface with an eccentricity in the
range of 0.2-0.7, at least one of the eccentricity and a

vertex radius of curvature of said ellipsoidal surface of
said intermediate portion being different from that of

said ellipsoidal surface of said central portion;

a marginal portion (20) is located around
the periphery of said intermediate portion and includes,

adjacent said intermediate portion, a surface region
which is non-convex as seen in axial cross-section and is

not part of the same ellipsoid as defines said 
intermediate portion, said surface region being formed so

that said marginal portion is spaced away from said
cornea such that an axial clearance between said cornea

and said back surface of said contact lens increases with
an increase in a distance of said marginal portion from

said intermediate portion in a radially outward
direction, said central, intermediate and marginal

portions being continuously contiguous to each other to
provide said back surface of said lens, and said surface

portion having, as seen in axial cross-section at the
