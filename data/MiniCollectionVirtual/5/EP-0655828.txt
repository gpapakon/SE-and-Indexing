<ABSTRACT>
A switching boost type voltage regulator includes a resonant snubber 
network (C1, Q2, L2, CR2, CR3) connected in parallel with its FET power switch 

(Q1). The snubber includes a FET auxiliary switch (Q2) that is connected and 
turned on in order to reduce the voltage across the FET power switch (Q1) to a zero 

level at its turn-on transition. A driver circuit, driven by a voltage regulating pulse 
width modulation (PWM) pulse, initially turns on the FET auxiliary switch (Q2) to 

reduce a voltage across the FET power switch (Q1) and then turns on the FET power 
switch (Q1) when the voltage across it drops below a threshold level. The FET 

auxiliary switch is turned off when the FET power switch is turned on. A latch 
circuit (Q3, Q4) insures the complementary states of these two switches. The 

snubber circuit is disabled a near to zero voltage regardless of line and load levels 
and hence the power dissipation in the snubber is significantly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power circuits and in particular to reducing 
voltages across the power switch during switching transitions. Modem requirements for power supplies generally specify operating 
efficiencies significantly above requirements acceptable in the past. This is due in 
part to the stringent environments in which modern power supplies must operate. 
These environments require higher power supply power densities and also limit the 
amount of dissipated heat that is allowable as compared with past requirements. 
Accordingly the individual components as well as the overall power supply must be 
operated in the most efficient manner possible. A major source of power loss in switching type power supplies is to be 
found in the power dissipation occurring in individual components of the power 
supply. One such component, which is a major source of power dissipation, is the 
semiconductor power switch. Power dissipation is caused by the simultaneous 
occurrence of voltage across and current passing through the switch during its turn-off 
and turn-on transitions. During the turn-on transition, for example, the time 
interval of reduction of voltage across the switch is concurrent with a current flow 
through the switch and power dissipation occurs. This power dissipation is a direct 
function of the current level passing through the power switch. With the recent trend 
to higher output currents required of power supplies this has become a serious 
problem to the power supply designer. One approach to reducing this turn-on transition dissipation has been the 
use of snubber circuits to control the voltage and current of the power switch during 
switching transitions. These snubber circuits have been used very successfully in 
high output power supplies of the past. The characteristic of the conventional 
snubber circuit involve a voltage reduction time interval that is dependent on the 
amplitude of current flowing through the snubber circuit. The design of the snubber 
circuit requires selection of a reduction time interval that can handle worst case 
scenarios i.e. anticipated worst case conditions of line and load. In the instance of 
switching power supplies used for power factor enhancement in coupling an AC line 
to a circuit the constantly changing instantaneous currents combined with the 
reduction time interval induces unnecessary conduction looses in the snubber circuit 
itself.  Therefore a snubber arrangement is provided as recited in claim 1 for 
enhancing the efficiency of
