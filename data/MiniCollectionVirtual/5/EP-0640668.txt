<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a slightly water-soluble, time 
release corrosion inhibitor compound for treating aluminum 

flake pigment. The corrosion inhibitor is the reaction 
product of a water-soluble metal salt including metals 

selected from the group consisting of yttrium and rare earth 
metals and an anionic metal salt including transition metal 

oxo-complexes and soluble salts of silicon and mixtures 
thereof. The corrosion inhibitor is useful for preventing 

hydrogen gassing of aluminum pigment particles. The 
compound is particularly useful for preventing gassing of 

bare and chromated aluminum pigment particles in aqueous 
compositions and in water-borne coating compositions having 

a basic pH. The pigment particles used in combination with 
the corrosion inhibitors of the present invention experience 

significantly less hydrogen gassing in a high pH aqueous 
environment and in water-borne coating compositions having 

high pH, than aluminum flake pigment particles and coatings 

without the corrosion inhibitor. The corrosion inhibitor is 
also effective when combined with a second corrosion 

inhibitor, such as a water-soluble salt of yttrium or rare 
earth metal in a coating composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the field of aluminum
flake pigments made corrosion resistant by treatment with a
time released corrosion inhibitor compound. The invention
also pertains to coating compositions containing the treated
aluminum flake pigments.The present invention pertains to corrosion inhibition
of treated aluminum flake pigments alone and
for use in waterborne coating compositions. Aluminum flake
pigments are slightly reactive in an aqueous environment
having a basic pH, such as aqueous coating compositions.
The pH of the water-borne acrylic coating compositions
typically ranges from 8.0-9.0, and the polyurethane coating
compositions have a pH typically ranging from 7.5 to 8.0.In a basic pH environment, the aluminum pigment reacts
with water to produce hydrogen gas and aluminum hydroxide.
The reaction is a form of corrosion and converts the pigment
to a hydrated oxide form unsuitable for pigment use, as it
destroys the metallic pigmentation properties of the mirror-like
particles. The amount of corrosion is measured by the
amount of hydrogen gas produced over a given period of time.Once formation of aluminum hydroxide begins, corrosion
accelerates. This is because the OH- ions cause the pH of
the environment to further increase, resulting in the
increased formation of aluminum hydroxide.The aluminum pigment deteriorates over time due to
oxidation, as it remains in continuous contact with the
basic pH environment of the coating composition. Coating 
compositions containing the pigment are often stored for 6
months or more before application, which can result in
significant corrosion of the pigment. If this corrosion
remains unchecked the coating composition may be unusable.An additional factor affecting degradation of the
pigment in a coating occurs when the paint is pumped from
the storage site to the application site. This distance is
often several blocks in length. The pumping action required
to transport the paint this considerable distance is severe
and results in breaking of the pigment particles, which
exposes even more of the surface area of the pigment to
corrosion. Corrosion inhibition can be achieved if the
rates of these reactions, or any partial steps involved, can
be decreased.It has been found that time released corrosion
inhibitor compounds inhibit corrosion in aluminum flake
pigment particles in a basic aqueous environment. The
corrosion inhibitor compound is the reaction product of
water-soluble compound of yttrium or rare earth metal and an
anionic metal complex
