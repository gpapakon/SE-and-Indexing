<ABSTRACT>
A non-oriented silicon steel sheet having a low 
core loss contains Si in an amount of about 2.5 - 5.0 wt% 

and S restricted to about 0.003 wt% or less and 
inclusions; the volume ratio of those inclusions having a 

particle size of about 4 µm or higher to the total volume 
of inclusions is about 5 - 60 %, and the volume ratio of 

inclusions having a particle size less than about 1 µm to 
the total volume of inclusions is about 1 - 15 %; when 

the sheet contains Mn in an amount of about 0.4 - 1.5%, 
and the volume ratio of particles less than 1 µm is about 

1 - 5 %, the silicon steel sheet also has a low rotation 
core loss. 
The method of manufacturing comprises 
controlling the change of a cooling speed to about 5°C/s² 

or less in the cooling process of such steel sheet in a 
finish annealing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicon
steel sheet having a low core loss, and further relates
to a silicon steel sheet having both a low core loss and
a low rotation core loss. The invention further concerns
a method of manufacturing non-oriented silicon steel
sheet having a low core loss and excellent low magnetic
field characteristics.Non-oriented silicon steel sheets are widely
used as core materials for motors, transformers and the
like. Recently, the efficiency of electric appliances
has needed improvement from a viewpoint of energy saving.
Further, it is required to reduce core loss further.The general concept of increasing added amounts
of alloy elements such as Si, Al and the like to increase
specific resistance is generally known as a way of
reducing the core losses of non-oriented silicon steel
sheets. However, the addition of alloy elements such as
Si, Al and the like for this purpose causes problems
because the cold rolling properties of the steel are
harmed by the presence of the added elements. Moreover,
increase of added Si and Al is disadvantageous due to
increase of material cost, processing and the like. Alternatively, reduction of core loss has been
attempted by optimizing the aggregated steel structure by
improving conditions during the cold rolling process.
Technology of such method is disclosed in, for example,
Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. Sho 56-22931
(GB-A-1514375).From GB-A-1514375, there is known that the sulphides or oxides are acting adversely on
the grain growth in non-oriented electrical steel sheets and that degassing,
desulphurization and deoxidation should be carried out. Furthermore, said document
teaches that fine precipitates and inclusions of a particle size up to 0.1 µm consisting of
oxides and sulphides, have to be carefully controlled.However, further improvement of core loss by
optimization of the aggregated structure is difficult
because the optimum aggregated structure conditions and
methods suitable for use with added Si are already
available. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce core
loss further by optimizing the aggregated silicon steel
structure.Further, core loss can be reduced by reducing
amounts of impurities or numbers of precipitated
particles in the steel. Reduction of impurities in steel
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication
No. Sho 59-74258. Although this is effective to reduce
core loss, high degrees of purification depend upon
specialized iron and steel manufacturing technology; the
degree of purification

slab casting, slab heating and hot rolling of said slab to restrict the solid solution precipitation of inclusions
and thus achieve the volume fraction of said inclusions

as defined,
subjecting the hot rolled silicon steel sheet to one cold rolling process or
to a two or more cold rolling processes with intermediate annealing

therebetween to achieve final thickness, and
subjecting said cold rolled silicon steel sheet to final annealing comprising
the step of cooling said steel sheet from the soaking stage in said final

annealing by controlling the change of cooling speed of said sheet to
5°C/sec

 or less until a predetermined cooling speed.
