<ABSTRACT>
A resealable package formed from one or more 
sheets of an ionomer resin includes an ethylene-methacrylic 

acid copolymer in the zipper, or between 
the zipper and the sheet or sheets. The zipper 

itself includes male and female interlocking zipper 
profiles, one or both of which may be extruded from 

an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer. 
Alternatively, strips (22) of this copolymer may be 

applied to the sheet or sheets (20) of ionomer resin, and 
male and female profiles (24,26) of a more commonly used 

polymeric material, such as low density polyethylene, 
may be applied to the strips. Ribs (28) of the ethylene-methacrylic 

acid copolymer may also be applied to the 
sheet or sheets parallel to the male and female 

profiles, where the profiles are not of the ethylene-methacrylic 
acid copolymer material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture 
of plastic bags or packages having at least two plies 
of thermoplastic sheeting, both plies having closure 
strips included on their facing inner edges so as to 
form a zipper-like closure for the openings of the 
bags or packages made therefrom. The plies may be 
formed from two separate sheets or from a single 
sheet folded over. The present invention relates to improvements in 
the package-making art and may be practiced, without 
limitation, in the manufacture of thermoplastic bags 
and trays of the kind that may be used for various 
consumer products, but which are particularly useful 
for food products which must be kept in moisture- and 
air-tight packages, free from leakage until opened 
for access to the product contents, which packages 
are then reclosable by zipper means to protect any 
remainder of the product therein. The indicated art is fairly well developed, but 
nevertheless is still susceptible of improvements 
contributing to increased efficiency and cost 
effectiveness. In recent years, reclosable food packages have 
been made from sheets of an ionomer resin available 
from Dupont under the name SURLYN®. This material is 
an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer wherein the 
acid sites are cross-linked by metallic cations. The 
choice of metallic cation to be used is governed by 
what ultimately is to be packaged. For example, 
sodium will make the sheet more resistant to oil and  
 
grease, and, for this reason, may be used to produce 
sheets for packaging meat. Zinc, on the other hand, 
yields a sheet which is less sensitive to water. Male and female interlocking zipper profiles are 
most commonly extruded from low density polyethylene 
(LDPE). Problems are encountered, however, when one 
attempts to extrude or to seal a polyethylene zipper 
onto SURLYN® materials. Because polyethylene bonds 
poorly to SURLYN® materials, it is difficult to 
obtain a satisfactory adherence of the zipper to the 
sheet and to avoid leakage through the zipper ends, 
after zipper bags have been made from the SURLYN® 
sheet to which the polyethylene zipper has been 
attached. Clearly, these difficulties would be overcome by 
making the zipper from a material naturally more 
compatible with SURLYN® than polyethylene. A 
solution to these difficulties is provided by the 
present invention. The present invention is a resealable package of 
the type described above, but which includes an 
ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer in the zipper, or 
between the
