<ABSTRACT>
Complexes between (1) a disulphonate of formula 

 
(X is barium or strontium and RÂ¹ is a bivalent group derived 

from an alkane by removal of two hydrogen atoms) and (2) a 
macrocyclic polyether compatible with a barium or a strontium 

ion. Also claimed is a process for isolating such macrocyclic 
polyethers in high yield from a solution containing 

them, by reaction with a disulphonate of the said formula to 
precipitate the said complex, separating the complex and 

extracting the separated complex with a solvent for the macrocyclic 
polyether.
