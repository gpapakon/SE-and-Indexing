<ABSTRACT>
A rotary disintegrator for liquid-borne solid 
waste, for example, has a cutter head (14) in which a 

rotatable headstock having cutting blades (28, 30) is 
urged by springs (38) against a shear plate (15). A 

signalling means for signalling predetermined wear of 
the shear plate (15) by the cutting blades (28, 30) 

includes a wear detector (65) having a rod electrode 
(67) mounted by an insulating plug (72) within a bore 

(74) in the shear plate (15). When the plug (72) is 
worn by the cutting blades to expose the electrode (67) 

the electrical circuit of the signalling means is 
completed thus providing an indication that a 

predetermined degree of wear of the shear plate (15) has 
occurred.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention comprises improvements in or 
relating to rotary disintegrators and concerns more 
particularly, although not exclusively, rotary 
disintegrators for liquid-borne solid waste , farm 
manure and other slurries of the type comprising a 
rotating spring loaded headstock which shears solids 
within holes in a stationary shear plate. Wear takes place on both the shear plate and the 
headstock until a limit is reached, whereupon the cutters 
no longer achieve the desired disintegration of the solid 
waste. Apart from periodic visual inspection, there is no 
means at present by which the point can be detected at 
which the cutters can be regarded as exhausted and in 
need of replacement. An object of the present invention is to overcome 
this difficulty when using cutter heads in machines of 
the general kind. According to the present invention there is 
provided a rotary disintegrator for liquid-borne solid 
waste, farm manure and other slurries comprising a 
cutter head having  
 
a pair of relatively rotatable cutting parts having 
cutting edges lying in respective faces thereof and 
urged into contact with one another, face-to-face, and a 
signalling means for signalling predetermined wear of 
one of said faces comprising a wear detector fixed with 
respect thereto and arranged to detect when said 
predetermined amount of wear has occurred and activate 
the signalling means. Embodiments of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example only, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings of which Figures 1 and 2 are 
cross-sectional views of a first and a second embodiment 
of the present invention. With reference now to Figure 1, a rotary 
disintegrator generally designated 10 comprises a cutter 
head housing 11 and having an inlet 12 for liquid 
containing solid waste e.g. sewerage waste. The cutter 
head, generally indicated at 14, comprises a replaceable 
shear plate 15 removably fixed in the housing 11 by 
screws 100 and located by a key 101 which is secured by 
screw 16. Liquid bearing solid waste entering the 
housing through the shear plate 15 from the headstock 
side 14 passes through holes such as 18 in the shear 
plate 15 in which the solids are sheared, at the lower 
face 19 in the drawing of the shear plate 15, by  
 
the rotating action of a headstock, generally indicated 
at 20, running in a central bore of the shear plate, the 
headstock comprising a hub 22 to which is removably and 
replacably fixed, by means of screws 24, a sub-assembly 
26 of cutting blades

<CLAIMS>
A rotary disintegrator for liquid-borne 
solid waste, farm manure and other slurries comprising a 

cutter head (14) having a pair of relatively rotatable 
cutting parts (15, 20) having cutting edges lying in 

respective faces thereof and urged into contact with one 
another, face-to-face, and a signalling means (64) for 

signalling predetermined wear of one of said (15) faces 
comprising a wear detector (65) fixed with respect 

thereto and arranged to detect when said predetermined 
amount of wear has occurred and activate the signalling 

means (64). 
A rotary disintegrator as claimed in 
claim 1 in which one of said cutting parts is a shear 

plate (15) having holes (18) or other apertures in which 
solids are sheared between the plate (15) and the other 

cutting part (20) and said wear detector (65) is fixed 
with respect to the shear plate (15). 
A disintegrator as claimed in either one 
of claims 1 and 2 in which said wear detector (65) has a 

face (66) subject to wear and eventual breakthrough by 
the other of said faces. 
A disintegrator as claimed in claim 3 in 
which the wear detector (65) is mounted in a dedicated 

hole in the shear plate (15) with its face (66) subject 
to wear and eventual breakthrough, recessed in the hole. 
A disintegrator as claimed in either one 
of claims 3 and 4 in which said wear detector (66) face 

subject to wear and eventual breakthrough is a hollow-casing 
face. 
A disintegrator as claimed in claim 5 in 
which said wear detector (66) is composed of an 

electrically insulating material and said signalling 
means (65) is electrically operated. 
A disintegrator as claimed in either one 
of claims 5 and 6 in which said hollow (72) casing 

houses an electrode (67) which is spring loaded against 
the casing wall towards the inside of said hollow casing 

face. 
A disintegrator as claimed in either one 
of claims
 1 and 2 in which the wear detector (65) 
comprises an (67) electrode which is located so as to be 

electrically insulated from said one of the faces (66) 
 

within a recess in the face until exposable to the 
slurry by wear of the face (66) by the other of said 

faces (32). 
A disintegrator as claimed in claim 8 in 
which the wear detector (200) comprises an electrode 

retained within a blind hole (202) in the face (761), 
which hole (202) is exposed after said predetermined 

wear of the face. 
A disintegrator as claimed in claim 9 in 
which the blind hole (202) is in a shear plate (15) and 

the electrode (200) is retained in the blind hole (202) 
by an insulating plug (204) which also seals the shear 

plate (15) to a housing (11) in which the shear plate 
(15) is mounted.
