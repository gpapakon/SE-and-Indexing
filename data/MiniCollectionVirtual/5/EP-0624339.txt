<ABSTRACT>
A sequence controller (30) controls gradient pulse amplifiers (20) and a digital 
transmitter (24) to apply a conventional magnetic resonance imaging or spectroscopy 

sequence. One or more of the resonance excitation pulses includes a series of very small tip 
angle RF pulses (52,70) applied in rapid succession substantially within the time interval of 

a normal RF excitation pulse (e.g. 10 msec.). A series of gradient pulses (58x, 58y, 72y, 72z) 
with linearly diminishing amplitudes and a repetition cycle that is an integer multiple of the 

duration of the very small tip angle RF pulses are applied such that an excitation trajectory 
in k-space follows a piecewise linear square spiral (FIGURE 3) when gradients are applied 

along two axes or an octahedral spiral (FIGURE 6) when a series of gradient pulses are 
applied along three axes. The subregion of resonance excitation is selectively shifted along 

one of the axes by applying a series of frequency offset pulses (66, 76) along one or more 
of the axes. In this manner, the position of the subregion of resonance excitation is shifted 

without changing the phase component of the RF pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for and method of exciting magnetic
resonance in a limited subregion of an examination region. The invention finds particular
application in conjunction with dark blood flow tagging for angiographic magnetic resonance
imaging and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, it should be
appreciated that the invention will also find application in connection with magnetic resonance
excitation for other magnetic resonance applications.It is well-known in the magnetic resonance arts that resonance can be excited in a
planar region or slice by the simultaneous application of a selective RF pulse and static
magnetic field gradient. This selective RF/static magnetic field gradient has been used to
create localized excitation in a slice or planar region. This combination of selective RF pulse
and static magnetic field gradient has been used in angiographic imaging for flow tagging.
Typically, magnetic resonance was excited or saturated in a slice or slices adjacent a planar
region or slice of interest. A series of RF pulses applied with a series of static gradients have
been used to excite resonance or saturate blood in a plurality of slices or regions around the
region of interest.When a conventional imaging sequence was performed on the slice or other region of
interest, the non-blood tissue was imaged normally. However, the blood which was tagged
by prior excitation or saturation had different magnetic resonance imaging properties than
blood 
which was not previously excited or saturated. As the
blood from the adjacent slice(s) flows into the slice or
region of interest, it changes the properties of the blood
tissue displayed in the resultant image. This enables the
resultant diagnostic images to be used to measure flow,
measure flow rate, track flow paths, and the like.One of the problems with tagging an entire region
or plane is that it tagged not only the blood flow of
interest but-also blood flow which was not of interest.
The plane typically extended across the examination region,
tagging blood flow in portions of the patient that were not
undergoing diagnostic examination. When the tagged blood
from these remote regions flowed into the region of
interest, the tagged blood of interest and the tagged blood
from remote regions was indistinguishable. Accordingly,
others sought to restrict the tagging region to a smaller
region than the entire slice.One technique for limiting the tagging region
used a series of RF pulses with a series of
