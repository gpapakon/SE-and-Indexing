<ABSTRACT>
A partial oxidation process for the production of a 
stream of cooled and cleaned synthesis gas, reducing gas, or fuel 

gas substantially free from entrained particulate matter and slag. 
The hot raw gas stream from the partial oxidation gas generator is 

quench cooled with deaerated grey water in a quench tank to produce 
black quench water or cooled in a radiant and/or convection cooler. 

The cooled gas is scrubbed with deaerated grey water in a scrubbing 
zone to remove all of the entrained particulate matter and to 

produce black scrubbing waters. The black water is resolved in a 
flashing zone
 and reused by flashing it in two or three flash 
stages connected in series and separating the overhead flash vapors 

comprising vaporized grey water and sour gas from the bottoms 
comprising concentrated black water. The flash vapors from the 

first flash stage are used to heat a stream of deaerated grey water 
being recycled to the quench tank and gas scrubbing zone or to the 

gas scrubbing zone. The concentrated black water from the flashing 
zone is thickened in a clarifier and then filtered to produce 

filter cake which may be burned and grey water filtrate. The flash 
vapors from the second flash stage and optionally steam are 

introduced into a deaerator to strip dissolved oxygen from incoming 
make-up water, grey water condensate, and grey water filtrate.

 
In another embodiment of the process, the flash zone comprises 

three flash stages.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of cooled and 
cleaned gaseous mixtures comprising H2, CO, CO2 and H2O by the 
partial oxidation of liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuels or aqueous 
slurries of solid carbonaceous fuels. More particularly, it 
pertains to a process for cooling and cleaning synthesis gas with 
water to remove entrained particulate matter and includes flashing, 
deaerating, and energy efficient filtration of the gas cooling and 
scrubbing waters. The partial oxidation process is a well known process for 
converting liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuels into synthesis gas, 
reducing gas and fuel gas. See coassigned U. S. Pat. Nos. 
3,988,609. 4,251,228; 4,436,500; 4,468,376 and 4,704,137 for 
example, which are incorporated herein by reference. The raw 
effluent gas stream leaves the reaction zone at a temperature in 
the range of about 1100°C to 1540°C and comprises H2, CO, CO2 and 
H2O along with minor amounts of other gases. Also included in the 
gas stream is entrained particulate matter in an amount in the 
range of about 1.5 to 500 gr/m3. In order to prevent contamination 
and/or plugging of beds of catalyst located downstream or to 
prevent plugging of burner nozzles, it is necessary to clean the 
raw gas stream by contacting it with water. Quench cooling the hot 
raw gas stream in water contained in a quench tank is shown and 
described in coassigned U. S. Pat. No. 4,801,347, which is 
incorporated herein by reference. Scrubbing the hot raw gas stream 
by means of a scrubbing nozzle or orifice scrubber is shown and  
 
described in coassigned U. S. Pat. Numbers 3,524,630 and 3,749,377, 
which are incorporated herein by reference. The solids 
concentration in the water used in gas quenching and scrubbing 
is in the range of about 0.1 to 6.0 wt. %. This water is called 
black water. It is pumpable and normally contains about 2.0 wt. % 
of particulate carbon. Removal of particulate carbon from the 
black water is commonly done by solvent extraction in a one or two-stage 
decanter, such as shown and described in coassigned U. S. 
Pat. No. 4,014,786. The carbon extraction system is complex and 
has a high capital cost due to its large number of equipment items, 
cost of solvent, as well as high energy cost. Steam consumption is 
high and heat exchange efficiency due to frequent fouling of the 
black water/grey water exchangers is poor. Thus, the most commonly 
used but costly solvent carbon extraction system is eliminated by 
the subject process. This arrangement eliminates the need for 
extra
