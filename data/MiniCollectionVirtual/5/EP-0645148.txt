<ABSTRACT>
A housing (10) contains a perfume cassette (30) and a 
fan (21), a photoelectric cell (14) supplying a 

capacitor (41) that is periodically discharged to drive 
the fan. The device includes a cycle counter (57) which 

activates a warning device (58) when casette (30) 
reaches the end of its expected operating life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air conditioning 
devices, and in particular to air freshening devices 
powered by photoelectricity. Air freshening devices are used in the home and 
workplace to eliminate unpleasant odours. It is 
desirable that such devices should be portable for ease 
of installation. However, if the device is to be 
effective some form of fan is needed which requires a 
power source. Battery power could be used but the 
batteries would require periodic replacement. US-A-5,105,133 discloses a battery-powered automatic 
perfumer which can operate in a continuous mode, an 
intermittent mode in which operation is controlled by a 
timing circuit, or a light-activated mode in which the 
timing circuit is disabled until a photoelectric element 
detects a predetermined intensity of light. GB-A-2 247 623 discloses an air freshening device 
comprising a housing having an air flow path 
therethrough, fan means to move air along the flow path, 
means to distribute an air freshening substance into the 
moving air, photoelectric power means to drive the fan 
means, and means to control the operation of the device. The means to control the operation of the device 
comprises a standard timing circuit. The term timing 
circuit is to be taken to mean a circuit incorporating a 
clock component. This requires a continuous power 
supply in the form of a rechargeable battery. The 
provision of such a battery is expensive, especially as 
the lifetime of rechargeable batteries is finite.  Accordingly, the present invention comprises an air 
freshening device comprising a housing having an air 
flow path therethrough, fan means to move air along the 
flow path, means to distribute an air freshening 
substance into the moving air, photoelectric power means 
to drive the fan means, and means to control the 
operation of the device, wherein the control means 
comprises capacitor means that is charged by the 
photoelectric power means and discharges to drive the 
fan means when the voltage across it reaches a 
predetermined upper value and recharges when the voltage 
reaches a predetermined lower value. In a preferred arrangement, the capacitor means is 
connected to a plurality of transistor switches which 
allow the capacitor means to charge until the voltage 
across it reaches said predetermined upper value; the 
charge in the capacitor means is then discharged until 
the voltage reaches said predetermined lower value. 
Preferably, both of said predetermined values can be 
varied. This may be achieved by
