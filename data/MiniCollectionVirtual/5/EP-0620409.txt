<ABSTRACT>
A computer-based thermal scene simulation system and method for generating 
synthetic images to facilitate the design and test of missile-borne electro-optical seeker 

systems. A scene is comprised of objects and a background selected from available 
target and background database files. Stationary or mobile objects are modeled by 

combining small planar facets to cover their three dimensional surface. Each facet is 
associated in the database files with the thermal and optical properties of the surface that 

is modeled. The background is modeled on the interior surface of a pyramid defining 
the extent of the scene, with the floor of the pyramid representing the surface of the 

earth and the sides of the pyramid representing an above horizon image. The pyramid 
surface is then divided into triangular facets that represent portions of the surface. Each 

facet is assigned a uniform texture selected from the background database files 
comprising background materials. The simulation is designed to be used with missile 

six degree of freedom simulations, and generates images as seen by a missile seeker 
based on instantaneous seeker line of sight, seeker position, seeker orientation, object 

orientations and positions, and background. Seeker-to-object aspect angles and range 
closure rates are processed by an image generation procedure. A projected image is 

then convolved with the optical point spread function of the seeker to generate a 
radiance distribution on the focal plane of the seeker. Sampling of the focal plane 

radiance distribution is modeled and an output data stream from the seeker to a signal 
processor is generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computer-implemented simulation
systems and methods, and more particularly, to a computer-implemented electro-optical
target and background simulation system and method that generates simulated images
that may be used in designing and testing missile tracking systems.Synthetic image generation from computer models has long been recognized as
a convenient way for simulating a dynamic sensor/tracker system. It is particularly true
when developing a high fidelity simulation to facilitate the design and test of a high
performance tactical missile system. However, the requirement of high fidelity imagery
from the models inevitably requires enormous computing resources. Recent advances
in computer technology and associated decreasing computer cost have made this
approach possible.Methods of presenting targets in realistic backgrounds with range closure are
needed for the accurate evaluation of electro-optic and multispectral (electro-optic
and
radio frequency) seekers designed to autonomously acquire a target and reject
background or false targets. Heretofore, the ability of a seeker to acquire a target and
reject background and countermeasures can only be demonstrated by expensive field
tests, including captive flights, in a limited number of settings. Furthermore, high
resolution seekers are sensitive to various portions of the target. Therefore, an accurate
evaluation of the total seeker-missile concept cannot be realized early in the design stage
of a seeker development program. The development of a flexible simulation capable of simultaneously generating
the electro-optic images in real time would allow a designer to test and refine parameters
for proposed seekers and trackers early in the design stage. Such a simulator must be
capable of interfacing to seeker simulations running in scaled time as well as
breadboarded seeker hardware running in real time.Subcomponent models for such a simulator fall into two categories. The first
set of models are those executed once per simulation run. These models include target
and background geometric and thermal properties models. For the background, these
models include environmental models of how each material in the scene interacts with
the environment, i.e., how thermal energy is gained and lost by each material, energy
gain required for a one degree temperature change for each material, and energy
radiated by a material as a function of temperature and wavelength. For targets, one
must model internal heat sources, such
