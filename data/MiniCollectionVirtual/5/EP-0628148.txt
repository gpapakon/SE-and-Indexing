A gas-filled child-proof lighter of the type in which the means for 
opening the burner valve (2) consist of a tilting lever (3) articulated to a fixed 

pin (4) orthogonal to the axis (2') of the burner valve (2), one end (3a) of the 
tilting lever (3), in the form of a fork or ring, is engaged under a collar (2a) of 

the burner valve (2) and the other end, or actuation end (3b) of which is 
intended to be actuated by the user by being pushed in the direction of the 

body (8) of the lighter, counter to the force of a return spring (11), the 
means for producing sparks themselves being independent or combined with 

the lever (3) for opening the valve (2), and in which there are combined with 
the lighting mechanism means for neutralising this mechanism, which means 

consist of a member movable between an active neutralisation position, in 
which it prevents the actuation of the control lever (3) for opening the valve, 

having a part located under the rear actuation end (3b) of this lever, and a 
non obstructing position in which it allows this actuation; this member which 

can be displaced, manually, by the user, from its active neutralisation 
position to its non obstructing position, being moreover, arranged so as to 

be returned automatically into the neutralisation position after actuation of 
the lighting mechanism, whereby the ti
lting lever (3) consists of a pusher 
(13) and means being provided for ensuring that the pusher (13) is 

momentarily kept in the non obstructing position before actuation of the 
control lever (3) and other means being provided to ensure that it returns to 

the active neutralisation position immediately after this actuation, 
characterised in that the pusher (13) is mounted so as to slide against the 

lower face of the rear end (3b) of the control lever (3), whose movement it 
follows, and is movable between active neutralisation position in which it is 

held supported against the rear end (3b) of the control lever (3), by a part 
(8b) of the body (8) of the lighter situated just above it and preventing any  

 
movement of the control lever (3) in the direction to open the valve (2), and 

an advanced and non obstructing position, in which the said part (8b) of the 
body (8) of the lighter is no longer in the described path of the pusher (13) 

in the direction of opening of the valve (2), making this operation possible. 
A gas lighter according to claim 1, characterised in that the pusher 13 
is mounted between two lateral longitudinal ribs 3c bordering the lower face 

of the rear end 3b of the control lever 3 and delimiting, under the rear end of 
the control lever (3), a groove 3d of the same width as the pusher 13 and 

ensuring its guidance, the pusher (13) being interposed between the bottom 
of this groove (3d) and the upper end of the return spring (11) of the control 

lever (3) in the closing position of the valve (2), this spring (11) being 
maintained against the bottom of the said groove (3d). 
A Lighter according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the return 
spring (11), of the control lever (30) is helical and its upper end is engaged 

on a peg (17) carried by the lower face of the pusher (13) whereas its 
lower end is engaged on a peg (16) securely fastened to a transverse wall 

(8a) of the body (8) of the lighter. 
A lighter according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the means for momentarily keeping the pusher (13) in the advanced and 

non obstructing position consist of a ridge (18) and a notch (19) set 
provided, respectively, one at the front end of the bottom of the groove (3d) 

for guiding the pusher (13) and the other at the front end of the upper face 
of the pusher (13) and situated, with respect to one another, in such a 

fashion as to allow their mutual engagement when the pusher (13) is 
displaced from its active withdrawn position to its advanced non obstructing 

position, this engagement being maintained by the force of the control lever  
 

return spring (11), in the absence of any other force communicated to the 
control lever (3). 
A lighter according to claim 4, characterised in that the means for 
automatically returning the pusher (13) into the active neutralisation position, 

immediately after actuation of the control lever (3) in the direction (9) for 
opening the valve (2), consist on the one hand, of a rigid skirt 13b which 

borders the rear end of the lower face of the pusher (13) and intended to 
bear against the lower end of the spring (11) for returning the control lever, 

which lower end is engaged on its fixed peg 16, before the end of the 
angular travel of the control lever (3) in the direction (9) for opening the 

valve (2), which has the effect, due to the stopping of the angular travel of 
the pusher (13), of disengaging the ridge (18) and the notch (19) with which 

the bottom of the groove (3d) for guiding the pusher (13) and the upper face 
of the latter are provided with, from one another, and on the other hand, by 

two ramps (21, 22) oriented suitably so as to act as cams, and provided 
respectively in the bottom of the groove 3d, for guiding the pusher (13) and 

on the upper face of the latter, to the rear of the aforementioned ridge (18) 
and notch (19), and intended to come into contact with each other 

immediately after the disengagement of the ridge (18) and of the notch (19) 
so as to participate, following the pressure generated by the action of the 

spring (11) for returning the control lever (3), in the withdrawal movement 
of the pusher (13), into its active neutralisation position. 
A Lighter according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the part of the body (8) of the lighter situated just below the rear end (13a) 

of the pusher (13) consists of the upper edge (8b) of the rear wall of the 
body (8) of the lighter.  

 
A lighter according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the part of the body (8) of the lighter situated just below the rear end (13a) 

of the pusher (13) consists of a shoulder (8c) provided, for this purpose, in 
the vicinity of the upper end of the inner face of the part of the wall of the 

body (8) of the lighter situated below the pusher (13). 
A lighter according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 
the front face of the rigid rear skirt (13b) below the pusher (13) is shaped so 

as to match the curved shape of the spring (11) for returning the control 
lever (3) when the pusher (13) occupies its advanced and non obstructing 

position. 
A lighter according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
one of the sliding contact faces of the pusher (13) and of the rear end (3b) 

of the control lever (3) has at least one projection (23) and the other at least 
one hollow (24), arranged in such a manner that each projection (23) is 

engaged in the corresponding hollow (24) in the withdrawn active position 
of the pusher. 
A lighter according to claim 9, characterised in that the upper sliding 
contact face of the pusher (13) has a longitudinal slot (2b) and the lower 

face of the rear end (3b) of the control lever (3) against which face the 
pusher (13) slides, carries a guide stud (25) constantly engaged in this slot 

(2b). 
A lighter according to claims 9 and 10, characterised in that the 
projection improving the retention of the pusher (13) in the active withdrawn 

position is carried by the upper sliding contact face of the pusher (13) and it 
consists of the two ends of a transverse rib (23) broken by the longitudinal  

 
slot (2b) of the pusher (13) whereas the hollow is provided in the lower face 

of the rear end of the control lever (3) and it consists of a transverse groove 
(24) able to house the rib (23) of the pusher (13) when the latter is in the 

active withdrawn neutralisation position.
